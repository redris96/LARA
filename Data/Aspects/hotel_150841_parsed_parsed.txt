<Content>Excellent Choice with a couple of Caveats Stayed at Iberostar Bavaro and overall I was delighted. Here are the highlights and a couple of caveats.Food: Outstanding. True 5 star territory. The variety and freshness from MULTIPLE buffets and a la carte restaurants was outstanding. Christmas dinner?... LOBSTERFEST !! The food here is vastly superior to any all inclusive I have visited.Grounds: Gorgeous... two story townhouses nestled in a beautiful coconut grove. They had little LED lights affixed on plam trees and plants all over the property. At night the effect was romantic and calming... simply lovely. The lobby bars and pool area facilities are exemplary and kept spotless.Rooms: Average. Bed was a bit soft for my liking and on a couple of mornings the resort struggled to provide sufficient hot water to the the rooms. However, the room was clean and the maid service was excellent.Ambiance: Family friendly resort with a lot of kids running around. Don't come here if you want an adult only atmosphere. Pools were average - nothing special but clean and cool.Clientele: Distinctly european. North Americans were in the minority. Multiple langauages being spoken - it was GREAT ! But for conservative US types beware.. topless bathers on the beach and fat men in tiny bathing suits !!!!Beach: Gorgeous.. sand was soft and cool even in the hot sun. Water was warm and turquoise. I would say however, that Cancun waters have the edge !!! Lots of shaded leafed umbrellas and lounge chairs.Flexibility: Stay at Iberostar Bavaro and have FULL access to all three Iberostar resorts.. all three are side be side and the effect is to have one HUGE playground for the week.Service: First all inclusive where the service staff would NOT let my wine glass empty at the dinner table or my coffee cup empty at the breakfast buffet... friendly and attentive.Worth the premium price... did I mention the food? - oh my god the food...Richard from Milton

<Content>Lovely winter get-away My fiancee and I stayed at the Bavaro for two weeks from 23rd November and had a fantastic time.Having previously stayed at the IB Lindo in Mexico, I was looking forward to staying at another IB resort. The Bavaro whilst excellent, is a little lacking in comparison, but after all, this is the Domincan Republic. That said, the grounds are superb, room service spotless and the Star friends work like trojons to ensure you have a fantastic time. Their ever ending enthusiasm and smiles made all the difference, even though we only joined in with the aquarobics and you were never forced to join in if you didn't want to. Star Friends at Bavaro are better than in Mexico for sure.I have no complaints regarding the food. Meals eaten at The Gourmet were fantastic. The buffet meals offered a variety of dishes and in my opinion catered for most tastes (even chicken nuggets and chips, but I don't go on holiday to eat those). The rooms are an excellent size and our mini bar was stocked daily without any problems. We tipped our maid every other day and this seemed to work well.The beach was superb and we walked each way every day we were there. Some days the sea was a little rough which produced some bits and pieces on the sand, but the men soon got to work with their rakes and cleared it. If I have to comment about the cleanliness of the beach, it would have to be about the number of cigarette butts that were left on the sand. As a non-smoker, I found this unacceptable and extremely selfish.Be warned, there are mosquitoes and I went prepared as I am usually troubled by them. However, this is the first time I've been bitten in daylight and had not applied my repellant. I recommend Jungle Formula. Cover yourself in it!!!My fiancee and I went on the day trip to Saona Island. Two words - don't bother! Admittedly the speed boat to the island and catamaran return was fun, but the island was a huge disappointment. We were herded like cattle from the boat and told which area of the beach we could sit in, despite it being empty. 15 minutes later, it was like the Normandy landings, boats appearing everywhere and there was not a stretch of sand to be seen. When we did venture into the sea, there was a very steep shelf of very rough (broken shells) sand which was sore on the feet. It was not my idea of the Caribbean. Later in the afternoon, a sound system started up with girls disco dancing and trying to get you to join in. Not my idea of paradise either. The beach at the hotel is far superior, although it's on the Atlantic and you can walk for miles if you so wish.Lastly, the weather. We arrived in the dead of night and had a monsoon-like downpour and by the time we found our bus were soaked through to the skin. We laughed, what else could you do? We had a couple of days where the sun hid away and a couple of downpours, but on the whole the weather was wonderful.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro: An Obvjective Review I recently returned from a one week stay at the Iberstar Bavaro beach resort. Prior to going I read many if not all of the reviews for the past 6 months to get a sense of what I would be in for. Clearly there are people who love this resort and others who are seem to be disappointed with one thing or another although there does appear to be some universal agreement about some things which I will touch on later in the review. I do think there is one aspect of this resort that needs to be pointed out well before any critiques are made. The cost of this resort is very very inexpensive. In fact while we stayed there over the Christmas holiday, which is traditionally one of the more expensive periods to stay in a resort during the year, we paid $170 per person per day. This includeds the room, food, drinks, activities, taxes, and gratuties. We were a family of 4 and we had 2 rooms or Junior suites as they call them. In light of what we paid I think this resort is a bargain, however, it is not a perfect resort by any stretch, and if your expectations are not married with an understanding that you are not going to receive the absolute highest level of service possible you may be in for a disappointing time. If you approach coming here with a reasonable expectation of what $170 will buy then you probably will have a good time. I have stayed at many AAA five diamond resorts, and rest assured, this resort is not even close to any of them. However, one will spend at least 4 to 5 times as much money at one of those hotels or resorts as compared with the Iberostar. The 5 star ratings given on this website may indicated that folks were indeed satisfied with their stay, but this is not a 5 star resort, nonetheless, it is a very good VALUE. I agree with almost everyone that the beach here is wonderful. Clean white sand and lots of chairs and shade should you want that. Honestly, this is about the nicest beach you will find anywhere and is probably the greatest strenth the resort has. The food is about what you would expect, a lot of variety, and reasonably well prepared. Hardly outstanding in any respect, but I would say it was on par with what you would get at the buffets on a cruise ship. This resort is serving thousands of meals a day. Meticulous attention to every meal served is not a hallmark of their dining expereince, don't expect it to be when you get there. Dinner at the specialty restaurants was slower paced and the food was slightly better, but still only adequate. Again given the price one is paying I thought it was a very good value. The rooms were categorized as Juior Suites. I think calling the rooms Suites is somewhat generous. It has a large bed and sitting area that may make it slightyly larger than a regular hotel room and by all accounts it was clean and workable. The grounds were beautiful and well maintained, folks were constantly tending to it and I give the beauty of the resort very high marks. The staff..... ah the staff. I think this might be the one aspect of this resort where people find the greatest level of disappointment. Don't get me wrong, everyone I encountered was doing their job, but for the most part that was it. They were not trained to give a high level of customer satisfaction, they were not empowered to go the extra mile to make sure their guests were taken care of. They were doing their job, and to be fair, when one is paying $170 a day for everything this is probably what your going to get. At the Ritz Carleton or Four Seasons I have never heard the word No ever uttered by anyone working there. No is a word you will hear while you are at the Iberostar Bavaro resort because none of the employees have received the training or direction needed to elevate their customer service to a very high level. If you are looking for this kind of service, spend the additional money and go somewhere else. If however, you want a nice tropical vacation, in a beautiful setting with a great beach, decent rooms and food for a great price this just may be the ticket for you.

<Content>Very Enjoyable; a few improvements needed I recently stayed at Iberostar Bavaro with my wife, 2 kids, my mother, sister, and other sister and her family, December 13-20. There were 10 of us total; my mother took us all on this getaway, something she's been wanting to do since my father passed away a couple years ago and we didn't get to do this with him.This was my third all inclusive; the first with Iberostar and first in Punta Cana. We usually go on a cruise every year around this time, and wanted to try the Dominican Republic. Overall, I thought the week was fantastic. Very, very relaxing, which is what we wanted. I'll start with the arrival. My mother has problems walking very far, so we requested a wheelchair from the airline (American) and it was waiting for us when we got off the plane. Our wheelchair escort got us through immigration and customs very quickly; we were able to bypass the lines because of the wheelchair (this would be a theme in the airports for both ends of the trip, thankfully.) I did not know about the $10/person charge to enter the country; apparently our travel agent told my wife, but she forgot to tell me. Not a big deal, we got through immigration, and went through what passed as customs, though noone talked to us and honestly, if there was one customs agent there, I never saw him. We met our tour operator, Apple Vacations, and were escorted to our bus for the ride to Iberostar Bavaro. It was a coach bus with a bathroom, and within 45 minutes, we were at the resort.Check-in was a breeze; while my brother-in-law and I went to check in, the wives went to make our reservations for the week in the special restaurants. We all got our bracelets, was given a brief 5 minute orientation, and we were on our way. We had rooms 2521, 2522, 2523, and 2541. The first three rooms were all in the same building, and the other was a building away. Perfect, just what we wanted. The rooms were very nice, clean. My wife said they were not as large as a room she had in Mayan Riviera last spring, but it was fine. The minibar was stocked with water, soda, and beer. The bathroom was vey nice, with a separate shower and tub. The only complaint I have about the room is the lack of english speaking TV stations. They had CNN and C-Span, and that was it. I know we're in Dominican Republic, but I expected a few more english speaking channels. Throughout the week, the room was made every day by 3pm, and was made very well. No complaints at all.Service:We had room service almost every day for a mid-afternoon snack, and the delivery was usually very quick. We had a problem with our safe one day, and the tech showed up within 15 minutes and solved our problem.The beverage service in the buffet was excellent. The wait staff was always around to take our order and offer refills. Once we learned to order a Cola Light for a Diet Coke, we were fine. I will say that a couple times it was difficult to order a Tanqueray and Tonic in the buffet. The waitresses seemed to have a tough time understanding my drink order, and once I just went to the lobby bar and got it for myself. The lobby bar bartenders were outstanding. Very attentive, always there to get us another drink while we were sitting at the bar. Again, when we were sitting at the tables around the bar, the wait staff had a tough time understanding our drink orders. While I can understand this in the buffet, I thought that the drink staff in a bar should have been better trained in Endligh to be able to take a standard drink order. Not a big deal, and we worked it out, but it was a minor annoyance.The in and out of pool bars were both well staffed, and it was never a problem getting a drink anytime at either of them.One item that I can't overlook is the almost complete lack of drink service poolside. We were at the pool everyday for at least 4 hours, and I believe that I was asked if I would like a beverage only twice during the week. Now, I can certainly walk to the bar and get a Cola Light or a pina colada, but I thought that there should have been much better poolside drink service.There were activities everyday, and they were clearly noted on boards in a couple of different places around the resorts.Food:Very good, not fantastic. The first night at the buffet, wow.... as one of my daughters said, if you can't find something you like in there, you're crazy. Plenty of different stations, breads galore, desserts, etc... Always something for everyone. After 7 days, it got a little monotonous, as is to be expected. But the quality of the food in the dining room buffet was very good. I thought the poolside buffet was good, but not great. I preferred to eat lunch in the dining room buffet on the last couple days, as I got a little sick of the same thing everyday in the poolside buffet. However, they did have a barbecue one day with ribs that was very good, and while I don't eat lobster, my brother-in-law said the lobster tails were good another day.For our specialty restaurants, we ate at the Steakhouse, Japanese, and Cajun.  The steakhouse was below our expectations; the meat was average. On our cruises, we always eat (and pay for) a specialty meal in the steakhouse, and those are always fantastic. This steakhouse actually seemed a bit below an Outback. The service was good, but the food was average.The Japanese steakhouse was very good. They put sushi appetizers on the table, which were great. We all agreed the hibachi cooking (not in front of you) was very good, and we all enjoyed our meal.The Cajun restaurant was excellent!!! This was the best meal we had, and I would recommend this restaurant highly. There was a buffet of appetizers which were great; the service was fantastic, and my meal, jambalaya, was outstanding. I wish I would have eaten there again.I visited the casino a couple times, which was nice. Kind of small, not very busy. I taught my 18 year old daughter how to play blackjack, and we both won a little money. It was a nice bonding moment.The grounds were just lovely. We constantly saw staff picking up trash, sweeping away puddles. The lights at night were stunning, and we went for walks often. Loved the grounds.The staff was great, as well. Most everytime we passed a staff member, they smiled at us and said Hola. There was always someone available to help us. The front desk clerks were knowledgeable and always willing to help us and answer our questions.All in all, I really enjoyed the week, and wouldn't hesitate to go back again.

<Content>Great Beaches and Staff We chose the Iberostar Bavaro for our honeymoon because of all of the fantastic reviews we read about the resort. For the most part it did live up to our expectations. For the second time we booked our trip through apple vacations and were very pleased with the service we received. Make sure you have used the restroom prior to getting off the plane. The plane's restrooms seem immaculate compared to the ones in the arrival area of the airport. There is not air conditioning in the arrival side of the airport so make sure you dress in layers. (There is air conditioning in the departure side once you get past the restaurants) Upon arrival into the airport your picture is taken with two women dressed in native Dominican dresses. You can buy the picture upon departure. From there you pay a $10 tourist fee- be sure to have your passport ready. Once getting your bags dodge the swarm of men that will try to help you with you baggage. (They expect large tips) Make your way to your tour company's counter to find out which bus will transport you to your hotel. The trip from the airport to the resort was fairly short, approx 30 min, compared to the other resort I stayed at on the island. However the freeway that they are constructing doesn't seem any more complete than it did several years ago when I visited. The busses are air conditioned, a much welcomed break from the heat. Dominican drivers don't really follow any traffic laws so brace yourself for a never ending game of chicken most of the way to the resort.We arrived at our resort at about 1:00. Check in was very quick and we were greeted with two bahama mama's to cool us down. We were a little disappointed to see so much construction occurring at the resort during our stay. Upon talking to several people, during low seasons the resorts will perform their renovations. Hence the lower pricing. Luckily most of the work was done at night so we didn't really notice much noise from it other than the main lobby. Our room was very spacious. We had a second floor suite with a king size bed. We never heard any noise from any of the other units in the building. The room was decorated with fresh cut flowers and was kept very clean. We did notice ants on the bathroom counter periodically throughout our stay. We realized that many times these would come from the fresh flowers that were put out. The refrigerator was not working when we arrived so we did have to wait almost an hour for it to be repaired. Towels were restocked daily and the room was kept very clean by the staff.The pool area was nice although the bottom of the pool could stand to be repainted. The whole time were at the resort the ocean water was warmer than the pool water. The swim up bar was great and we had the world's best bartender Hector. Everyone at the resort was so friendly and helpful. All of the employees always have a smile in their face. We spent more time at the beach however to get away from many of the kids. I was disappointed that they did not provide rafts for the pool.The grounds are kept immaculate. There are constantly men working on the landscape to keep the grass mowed and the trees trimmed. There were several animals walking around the resort. I have never been so close to a flamingo in my life. We also saw many cranes, birds, small lizards, and peacocks. The beach at Ibrostar is amazing!! During my last visit I stayed at Sunscape the Beach- now Dreams. The water at Iberostar is much more turquoise blue and clear. The sand is also much whiter. Overall the beach is cleaner. In the early morning crews actually come out and clean the seaweed and any debris off the beach. The sunrises are amazing. We are not morning people but we actually got up several times to see the sun rise right above the ocean. The pictures we have don't even begin to show the beauty of it. The water is very warm. It felt like bath water most of the time. We did visit the spa during our trip. The prices are very cheap compared to back home. The staff was very professional.The food was very good. We enjoyed breakfast most of all. Omelets are made to order. Doughnuts are fried fresh right in front of you and the buffet has everything you can imagine. There was a good variety at the buffets. We did go over to the other two resorts during our stay and the food was very similar. We did have three reservations at specialty restaurants. Be sure to book the first day you arrive to get the selections you want. We ate at the Japanese restaurant- very salty food and poor service. The gourmet restaurant was delicious. I would say I had one of the best steaks ever there. We also ate at the steakhouse which was ok. Overall the buffets were better. There is always something to find to eat. We went on two excursions in Punta Cana. Saona Island, which is worth the long bus trip, was breathtaking. The water is crystal clear and so warm. I could go on all day with how much we loved our visit there. We also went to Stingray bay which was an experience. It was worth the money as snorkeling in the ocean and with sharks is also included.The weather was beautiful and it only rained at night while we were there. I'm not sure if we'll stay at Bavaro again but we will definitely return to Punta Cana again. The beaches are amazing!

<Content>Really Relaxing Very nice hotel and grounds. I found it to be very clean and never saw a bug anywhere. The beach was so beautiful and relaxing. We spent most of our time at the beach and in the ocean. The ocean was warmer and quieter than the pool. The pool area is loud and has many activities. I went there to relax so I found it very annoying, but my husband enjoyed it since he doesn't like to sit around. I found the food to be not so great. There were many choices, but I believe that they catered more to European taste.By the end of our week stay I was really ready for healthy food at home. Definitely not for the low calorie diet. I came home with a flu bug and my husband with a rash. We both went to the doctor when we got home and were told it was from the food. Our biggest gripe was that every time we called for bottle water, towels, a pillow, etc. they never came. One day we called for extra towels and waited 2 hours then went to dinner and asked the front desk again and then went back after dinner and called again because they never came and still never got them. If you want anything to your room... get it yourself from a maid standAlso we had a broken lock on our slider to our patio and asked several times at the front desk and they never came. I enjoyed my relaxing time on the beach, but would not go back.

<Content>Too much smoking Just returned from a one week stay at the Iberostar Bavaro with my teenage daughter. We have vacationed several times at the Iberostar in Riviera Maya. This one was not on the same high level. Room was bigger, bathroom smaller. First room had only one bed (we had requested 2) and the glass on the picture in the bathroom was shattered. After complaining we were moved. Many people complained they only had one bed after requesting two. Grounds are very pretty, food was fine. Main complaints are the smoking and the bugs. It seems the majority of the people are from Europe and although not allowed in the rooms and restaurants, people were chain smoking everywhere else. At the outdoor show and in the lobby we could not find a seat where we would not be engulfed in smoke. At the Xmas dinner we were told smoking would be allowed in the dining room. It really was awful because it wasn't only cigarettes, cigars were also permitted. Also there were alot of bugs in the resort and we came home bitten up even though I used bug repellent often. My teenager enjoyed the disco, but it was a distance from the Bavaro and I would not let her go there alone. Drinks were not served in the pool area and I am not sure waiters in restaurants knew the difference between coke and diet coke. Exercise room not impressive and a distance.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro is First Rate!! I can not say enough about the Iberostar Bavaro, The staff is wonderful, helpful and top notch. The food was outstanding. The beach is to die for. More sun shades than any other place we have stayed. The suites are quiet and spacious.  The only thing that was a disappointment was the lack of wine selection. One white and one red. The mini bar had beer but no wine. If you want special wine you may have to figure out how to bring it.

<Content>Decent Trip We just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro.Rooms:Great, beds excellent, nice layout and very clean.Resort:Grounds Impeccable, Layout is average. I did not like the only bar open to be between the lobby and theatre area. The theatre shows were substandard. Workers are nice.Food / Drink:I found the diet coke to be syrupy at times, which ruins the cuba libre. Food was the best out of all my 10 trips down south. Room service was not bad.Beach:Amazing. Little wavy but lots of fun with the tubes we purchased on the caribbean street.Disco:The wing of a DC-6 airplane is the bar countertop, kind of cool. Not very busy but set in a cute plaza area.Dislikes: Shared services with the other two resorts. Too many trucks and mopeds on main walking paths. We stayed in 2401. Had trouble sleeping due to the operations at 4:30 am taking out the trash from the back of the restaurant. It was also close to the pool which was being renovated in the middle of the night, tile cutters buzzing at 2:00am. We then got extended checkout, which was really expensive $50pp, but we still had to pack up and move to a different room. If we had adequate rest we never would have needed extended checkout. Overall: The dislikes are just a minor aspect of the trip, i would go back here again for sure, price may be a little much though.

<Content>Wedding Day Disaster Our daughter was married at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana on December 6, 2008. She hired a wedding planner in the United States to help communicate better with the wedding planner at the Iberostar. We went through a travel agent in order to make certain all the plans for our guests would be flawless. We started all the planning in March, 2008, a full 9 months before the wedding to assure that everything went perfect. Alas...all the planning was to no avail. What our guests witnessed and what the newly married couple and her parents had to go through leaves me spellbound. The wedding ceremony was set on a spectacular stretch of beach. The chairs were set up for our 70 guests; however, the yellow caution tape surrounding the wedding ceremony is quite visible in all pictures, ruining the ambience. The couple arranged for a Dominican Justice of thePeace to marry them. (We have many e-mails confirming this) As I stood beside my husband, I kept asking, Where is the justice of the peace? :Who is going to marry them? Much to our surprise, the wedding planner dressed in her Iberostar uniform stepped up to perform the ceremony. After the ceremony, the confusion began. We had arranged for the guests to have champagne timmediately following the ceremony but no one communicated this to our guests .They eventually figured out that the champagne was for them and started to drift toward the table. The wedding party was taking pictures with the photographer as our wedding guests tried to guess where to go next. We had arranged for cocktails and hors'dourves outside the reception at the Steakhouse; however, nothing was set up when our guests arrived. The guests started to arrange the tables with votive candles, light the candles and then tried to track down the bartender. We paid extra for all of this to be prepared when our guests arrived. The bride and groom were left alone on the beach after the photographer finished. They walked by themselves back to the cocktail hour. The tables were not ready at the Steak House and we waited for over an hour before entering the steakhouse. Finally, the guests just stormed in. The bride and groom were once again left on their own to figure out what to do. With everyone seated, the bride and groom waited to be announced; however, there was no one to announce them as husband and wife. With the bride in tears, I stepped onto the dance floor, grabbed the michrophone and announced the newly married couple. Where was the wedding planner?? She was at another wedding taking place at the same time!! We had 75 people attending our wedding. She was at the wedding with 20 people. The salad bar was set up but there was no one there to direct our guests as to when to start getting their salad. Once again...I grabbed the microphone and told our guests to start making their way to the salad bar. Finally things settled down and the waiters started to take drink and dinner orders. Things were starting to run smoothly but not for long. Just as the cake was served, I noticed one of the waiters dressed in his Iberostar uniform guzzling a beer. I went to him and asked him to please return to serving our guests. He danced provocatively toward me and began to grind me. I ordered him to stop and he quickly apologized. I walked to my seat with him following me and apologizing profusely. He put his tray down on the floor beside me and spilled a full glass of beer all over my shoes, feet and the floor under my table. A wedding guest sitting beside me mopped the mess off the floor under me. Once again, I asked the waiter to Please, wait on our guests and get me a glass of wine. A few minutes later, I saw the same waiter at a guests' table with a bottle of wine and some glasses. I walked toward him and asked him to please pour me a glass of wine. What happened next is so humiliating. He drank from the bottle of wine and then poured some into a glass and handed it to me. He walked behind me, grabbed me in the groin and started to grind me from behind. My brother saw what was happening and raced over to get the waiter away from me. I quickly spoke to one of the managers. He was dressed in a plaid shirt with a western style tie. The manager laughed at me but shortly after, I noticed that the waiter had been sent out of the wedding. Immediately after this episode, the disc jockey shut down all his equipment and the wedding abruptly ended. What a nightmare for the newly married couple. They thought they were being married in paradise. It ended up to be a wedding from hell.I spoke to the Iberostar wedding planner and manager of the Iberostar Bavaro. They fired the waiter and offered to give my husband and myself a free 5 day stay...but what about the bride and groom. Their wedding day is forever gone and marked by humiliation and disappointment. The Iberostar Bavaro is a beautiful resort. The food is fabulous, the beach breathtaking and the grounds and rooms immaculate. Go there to vacation but do not get married there.

<Content>Great hotel in Punta Cana My parents, husband and I went to Punta Cana for a destination wedding and were amazed at how wonderful the Bavaro hotel was. The rooms are quite large, with either a king bed or 2 double beds and a large sitting area with 2 couches. The entire resort was beautifully landscaped and had wonderful Christmas lights up that looked wonderful at night.The foodThis resort had some of the best food of any all inclusive hotel I have been at. There was not a single bad meal and if you don鈥檛 like one item there are 15 other ones that are better. The restaurants were awesome as well, our 2 favorites were the Mediterranean and the gourmet.Quick word about the alcohol, they don鈥檛 carry top shelf alcohol so be ready to drink the not so great stuff. The beachThe beach is wonderful and clean. The sand is supper soft and amazing to walk on if you enjoy it. Also there is a ton of shade both by the pool and beach for those like me who burn.The StaffThey are all super friendly and most speak enough English that they will understand you and help you out. Also the lobby had free wifi so if you are addicted to your email you can check it for free.

<Content>Fantastic place for a vacation We just returned from a seven night stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. I traveled with my husband, my three year old daughter and my father. Just a bit of background about us, we have never stayed at an All Inclusive resort and have never been to the Dominican Republic. We have been on many cruises and traveled outside of the United States. We booked through our Travel Agent and used Apple Vacations. We had a nonstop flight from Chicago to Punta Cana. The flight was uenventful for the most part and we landed a little earlier than expected. We would easily fly USA 3000 again.The airport is as described. It looks like a giant hut, but seemed to be managed pretty effectively. We paid our $10 entrance feel and got through customs quickly. Our luggage also arrived shortly after. We did use the porters in the airport lobby. They got us to the head of a few lines and took us exactly where we needed to go, worth the couple dollar tip. The ride from the airport to the hotel was also fine. The busy was air-conditioned and newer. The Apple Representative on the bus was informative. The ride took about 40 minutes and went by quickly.We did e-mail the hotel ahead of time requesting rooms close to each other and with king-sized beds. We also requested an ocean view. The hotel did acknowledge our e-mail request and stated they would do their best to meet our preferences. Check in was fairly easy. Some of the rooms were not yet ready and guests were asked to get a drink and walk around. Our rooms were ready. They took our luggage to our room and we followed shortly after. We made our reservations for the restaurants that night. We ate at the Mediteranean, japanese and steak house. We were able to go one day at 3p and get an additional reservation at the cajun. I suspect that we probably could have ate at restaurants every night because there seemed to be extra accomodations, but we liked the buffet as well. The food was good as was the service. We were used to being spoiled by cruise food and service, but it was pretty close, although because you are eating at different places all the time, the service isn't quite as personal as a cruise. There were plenty of choices at the buffet. Some of the food was a little unusual, but the hotel does try to cater to a lot of different nationalities, so there is always plenty to eat. There was a beach bbq one day at lunch and a lobster grill one evening in the main buffet. I would suggest attending both. The food seemed fresh and well prepared. We had brought the usual stomach aids, but never used anything. We stuffed ourselves all the time and never had any problems with stomach issues.Our room was not ocean view as requested, but one row back. I'm sure just about everyone requests an ocean view room, so we weren't too surpised that we didn't get one. Our rooms were right next door to each other and they did have king sized beds, so they did meet two out of the three requests. The rooms are very good sized, especially compared to cruise cabins. The bathrooms were also very spacious. On one day our room was not cleaned and we had to call and request new towels. She did finally come as we were getting ready for dinner. The other nights, our rooms were cleaned by 2p. Again, a little different than a cruise. There also is not turn down service like there is on a cruise. Not a big deal, but something we noticed. The beach is gorgeous. The sand was pretty clean, some seaweed washed up during the evening, but there was very little garbage. It did bug us that people would put their cigarettes out in the sand and leave it there. Very disrespectful to the resort, the other guests and the earth in general. There were plenty of chairs and grass umbrellas available. The water was warm and that same shade of blue/green you think of when you picture a caribbean island. The ocean is a little rouger than we had experienced on other islands. I think because it is on the Atlantic side verses the Caribbean sea. Have to keep an extremely close eye on children, it would be so easy for a small child to get sucked away, but we had a blast. We had perfect weather. It rained occassionally at night, but the rain freshened everything each morning. The sun is strong as everyone mentions. We got a little sunburned, but also used plenty of SPF.We didn't use any of the resorts water activites like sailing or kayaks, but my husband did use the dive company on the resort property. He got really sea sick when he dived off one of their boats one afternoon, and he usually never gets sea sick. Because of the roughness of the ocean, he didn't enjoy that dive. We did go on one excursion to Catalina Island through Dressel Divers. It is about a two hour drive from the hotel to the other side of the island to the other Iberostar Hotel. Then it is a 45 minute boat ride to Catalina Island. We had a great time and because it is the Caribbean sea, the waters were much calmer. My husband had a much better time diving there. Although the Dominican Republic isn't known as a great dive destination, he seen plenty of coral and fish and had a good time overall. Dressel Divers were also a good company.We didn't see much of the other hotels, but we did use the spa service. I had a massage on the beach and my husband had a hot stone massage in the spa. Both were quite a bit cheaper than massages on a cruise and definately worth the money.One thing to consider about the Iberostar is the walking. We are a fairly fit family, but the resort is kind of spread out. You can use the golf carts to get you around, but we found that when we called for one either they never came or we waited about a half hour. We used them a little bit, but not too often. The walkways are incredibly slippery. Our little one fell several times. I just constantly held her hand when we were walking and she was okay, but leave the heels at home. I don't think it would be the easiest place to maneuver if one were elderly or had physical limitations. The atmosphere was mostly casual, which is also different from a cruise, but was fine with us. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The staff is also wonderful and seem to love kids. We mostly did our own thing, but they always stopped by to invite us to join in an activity. The evening entertainment was okay. It was not up to a cruise level, but they did their best and seemed to enjoy themselves. We did leave early twice, but then enjoyed the other two shows we attended. It is a family friendly place, but also didn't have tons of children around. Surprisingly nobody acted drunk and stupid. Their are plenty of topless women on the beach and also men wearing very small bathing suits. Our three year old didn't even notice that some women weren't wearing tops. It really wasn't a big deal for us. Nobody was topless at the pool. Compared to a cruise, this is definately more of a budget friendly vacation. Our three year old was free at the resort and free on the excursions. The only thing we paid for was her air fare. On a cruise we would have had to pay for her as a third person, which would be about $800, plus air fare and excursions. There wasn't the big bar bill at the end of the trip, which was also nice. We tipped people when we thought they did a good job. It was a great vacation overall and we are sure we will be planning another vacation using an Iberostar resort.

<Content>Great service and a beautiful place... We just returned from a 7 days vacation in the IB Bavaro... simply put, it was a very pleasant experience for me, my wife and my 3 y/old son.The room was very cozy and clean, the all included service included everything indeed, the food was very good and the staff were very friendly.My only suggestion to the hotel would be to enhance the number of people servicing the beach... you may have to walk a couple of hundred yards to the pool bar if you want your drink fast.Other than that... we had the most amazing time in Punta Cana.

<Content>A week in paradise!!! My wife and I visited the Iberostar Bavaro from Oct 24 - Nov 1. Wow wow wow...we had an absolutely amazing week and look forward to coming back!The hotel grounds were exceptional! It was extremely tropical everywhere you look! We especially loved the flamingos, peacocks, ducks, and other birds...which we were able to feed by hand. A huge thrill for bird lovers like us. The food was fantastic--we especially enjoyed the ribeye and veal steaks cooked while you wait, the amazing dark chocolate desserts, pasta cooked to order, pastries, and great European cheeses! We always found something very tasty to eat at the buffets. We ate at the gourmet, Japanese, and Mediterranean. The food was great--and one thing we found was if there are multiple appetizers you wanted to try on the menu--ask for both--ditto for desserts! The rooms were very nice. The beds were very comfortable (though we prefer more supportive pillows), marble everywhere, the toilet was a bit awkwardly placed but nothing too bad. We really liked the separate tub with a hand held wand (great for de-sanding) and the shower was very large, though it was a little odd that the door didn鈥檛 latch close. We also appreciated that plenty of towels were provided (usually we spread several on the floor (to soak up water that splashed out of the tub or shower. The sunken living room was spacious with comfy seating. The large flat screen tv was nice but we didn鈥檛 use it much. We also really appreciated the balcony which was large enough for both of us to enjoy the table, chair, and love seat/chaise lounge! All of the drinks in our mini fridge were restocked daily. The pool and pool bar were very nice...though we noticed some floating stuff in the waters. The pool was always cleaned each morning and we later found the 鈥渇loaties鈥?came from the thatched roofs and palm trees that overhang the pool. A very small price to pay considering the tropicalness. The water was extremely refreshing--especially with drinks from the pool bar in hand. We found it was large enough to never feel crowded. We also liked the 鈥榖each effect鈥?..white edges in the shallow part that looked like sand, with the deeper parts shaded darker blue. It was also very relaxing with the palm trees and other lush plants all around. Absolutely phenomenal! The beach was great. The sand was a gorgeous white and extremely fine--meaning you鈥檒l bring it back to your room whether you intend to or not. The water was many shades of blue/blue-green and nearly surreal. We did notice that there seemed to be patches of seaweed along various stretches. Not quite sure if it was just the time of year or what but very noticeable on the light sand. We also noticed the water wasn鈥檛 overly calm and moderate wave action kept the sand stirred up on the beach. Not a problem for us since we enjoyed the waves and body surfed a couple waves.One suggestion take bread/fruit with you and feed the fish while you are swimming in the ocean...it is amazing to have the fish literally eat out of our hands. Even more fun if you have a mask/snorkel so you can see just how many fish come out of nowhere! We found there were always plenty of palapas available on the beach as well as the around the pool! We also enjoyed the shark and ray excursion. It was amazing to feel just how soft the rays were underneath--liquid velvet--not to mention the thrill of swimming with sharks. Be prepared for very warm and humid weather regardless of the time of day/night. We found ourselves sweating by the time we walked from our room (on the beach) to the breakfast buffet. After the first day, we wore our swim suits to breakfast and went to the pool to cool off...not to mention a perfect reason to visit the swim up bar and start the day off with a drink. Enjoy your stay!

<Content>GREAT BEACH AND BEACH PALAPAS Just returned from Punta Cana. The Iberostar property is amazing, All jr suites are beautifully decorated...comfortable beds...sofa on balcony...large screen tv. Food excellent and desserts awesome.Specialty restaurants Jumbalaya and the French restaurant were enjoyed the most. Beach awesome and lots of palapas. PLEASEfeed the dogs between the Iberostar property and the Ocean Blue/Ocean Sand property. They are up by the beach shacks that sell cigarettes and other stuff. One of them just had 10puppiesand she is VERY hungry. Likes meat , eggs, cheese. Could not find dog food to buy. which would be much better. There are 3/4 dogs up there. I think they are all owned by the vendors but they are thin and need some help. Mama is VERY thin. Iberostar has beautiful water areas on the property and the lighting on them is awesome. It is also clean,clean,clean and has amazing staff.

<Content>Beautiful resort Being a travel consultant and booking this hotel many times I really wanted to see how it stacked up against other all inclusives. And I was pleasantly surprise. The grounds and landscaping were so beautiful and well maintaine. Everywhere you looked was beauty. The DR people work very hard to try to make your stay pleasant and they by far exceeded.The room we have was perfect. The only downfall would be we were to close to the entertainment at night and it was really loud for an hour or so. So my suggestion would be to ask for a room in the 2300's and higher. Closer the the beach and pool you will not have the loud noise, especially if you have younger children.The specialty restaurants were good. especially the french. THe buffets had more than enough varities to cover even the pickest eater. I loved the breakfasts the best. They have everything you can think of.Remember you are in the Caribbean and they are laid back kind of people, so be patient getting to the hotel from the airport 20 minutes is more like 40 minutes.The beach is very pretty, a little rough but was great for walking and enjoying.Would I go back to Punta cana you bet I really feel Iberostars are the best around and you will not be dispointed with the Bavaro.

<Content>When it is good, it is oh so good, BUT when it is bad, it is horrid! My family and I completed our sixth Iberostar vacation (Porto Plata, Riviera Maya, La Romana twice, Punta Cana twice). We have brought several families along with us on some of our vacations, and have recommended Iberostar to countless others. We always look forward to these family trips, and see Iberostar as a trusted 鈥渟econd home鈥? Our trip to Iberostar Bavaro from 12/22/07-12/29/07 proved otherwise.The trip started well. The resort responded to my e mail, and placed us in a beachfront room (316) based on our family鈥檚 loyalty to the resort chain. My three children (ages 22, 19, 17) were in the adjoining room (315). My oldest daughter Elana placed her cell phone in the safe found in the room (315) but noted that it was not functioning. She closed the safe door with the phone inside, but it would not lock. That evening (12/23), I reported the broken safe to the hotel desk, but was told by the front desk clerk, in a rather curt fashion, to 鈥渃ome back tomorrow鈥? I was a bit surprised by his lack of help in this matter 鈥?why not simply record the room number and have it fixed the next day? He would not listen to my reasoning. We all had forgotten that the phone was left in the closed but unlocked safe. No one in our family attempted to use the phone the entire vacation.On Friday, December 28, we began to pack for the return trip home. It was then that we had noted that the cell phone was missing. My entire family and I searched for the phone, but it was not found. I reported the the theft to the hotel management. They dryly stated that the phone could not be stolen 鈥?鈥渢here are no thefts at the resort鈥? We must have 鈥渕isplaced it鈥? We insisted that the phone was taken from the room, and that it was in a non-functional safe. I was asked if any other people had entered the room. My three children insisted that no one had. One evening, I was escorted to room 315 by security who verified that the safe was indeed broken. They also placed a 鈥渒ey reader鈥?in the door. They were able to determine that only one house keeper had access to the room. She had eight years experience in the hotel. A theft was therefore 鈥渋mpossible鈥? My request for an incident report was turned down. My questions about a police investigation were rebuffed entirely. Without these reports, an insurance claim would be impossible. On our return to the U.S. received the phone bill which lists a total of 177 calls made to numbers within the Dominican Republic with a total cost of $548.25. These calls were made from 12/24 鈥?12/28/07 on my daughter鈥檚 phone. None of these calls were made by anyone in my family. It would appear evident that my daughter鈥檚 phone was indeed stolen. We all can overlook the fact that this resort was not at its 鈥渂est鈥?the week we there. It appeared under-staffed and over-booked. The Christmas season can place extreme pressure on a 鈥減eople business鈥?such as an all-inclusive resort. That can explain the less than stellar service and the absence of the overall cleanliness that we have come to expect. This is understandable. What I cannot accept is the way in which my family and I were treated by the hotel and its鈥?staff as it relates to this theft. We were made to feel like the guilty party. We were simply told that these things don鈥檛 happen here. We were given no support whatsoever. This is what I feel cannot be overlooked.Most importantly, after phone calls and letters to: our travel agent (Doylestown Travel), the resort itself, Iberostar in Miami, and their international headquarters in Spain we have not gotten ANY response whatsoever. Simply put, an excellent place to stay if nothing goes wrong, BUT a disaster if something does.

<Content>Best beach ever Went to Iberostar Punta Cana week of Oct25-Nov 1 2008. Originally we were booked for Punta Cana part of hotel we were upgraded to Iberostar Bavaro d/t renovations- we were on a girlfriend getaway coming from different parts of the US, they put our rooms as close as possible to the pool and each other which was wonderful. The beach is wonderful, very quiet and relaxing. Poolside is more kids running around. Lots of families and couples, which was fine for us but probably not ideal for young singles. The buffet was pretty good lunch time grilled chicken is awesome!! Steak house was good although had an issue getting steak knives. We also ate at the Mediterrean restaurant and that was amazing!! Buffets are very Euro friendly- which was good for me cause i like trying new things- Drinks are made pretty weak unless you tip well....we got drinks one called for tequila and one called for gin-- definitely watched the bartender use the same liquor for both drinks!! Shows at nite were only entertaining when is was more improv rather than an organized dance show- the staff tried but a lot of times were off on the timing of the steps and it seemed more like a high school production. The audience participation shows were by far more enjoyable. The disco itself is nice- music not so good- starts out meringue and then turns to wedding music- there were a couple nites when it cleared out at 1a. It was off season so that might have been why. You can go through your travel guy (if you have one) and book a night at a club- the bus picks you up and drops you off and its $30 for all you can drink- we didnt see the need to pay that when we could drink for free there, but if you have to get your dance on , might be worth looking into. Spa was lovely. Staff defnitely friendly. Star friends also nice, experienced better entertainment staff at other resorts. Sometimes they would just seem to be in a foul mood ( could be d/t their LOOONNGG work days).

<Content>It was so wonderful until we got home.... My husbnd and I stayed at this resort September 8th through the 15th 2008. Our room was wonderful. The service was great. The grounds were beautiful. Everything was great while we were there. We tipped in the restuarants and the wait staff never forgot us. My husband tipped the cook and a rib eye steak was his anytime. That was at the buffet. It wasn't until a month after we got home that we realized there was a problem. The fraud department at our bank called. Our bank account had been compromised from someone in the Dominican. We had stayed in Punta Cana and the charges were coming from Santa Domingo. My husband had only used his debit card at the ATM in front of the bank on the resort.I do remember that one day when we came back from the pool our safe was open. Of course I asked my husband and he said that he thought that he closed it. We checked everthing and everything seemed to be there.The bank believes that my husband's card was compromised directly from our safe. All the information about you is in the strip on the back of your card. Who ever compromised our account actually has my husbands pin number. So a word to the wise make sure you don't bring any cards with you, only bring travelers checks or cash. I'm not sure how safe either would be at this resort. I can't find an e-mail address to notify the resort. If anyone has one please let me know.Thanks

<Content>Nice resort, but there are a few things to be aware of ... The reviews on Tripadvisor played the key role in my selecting the Ib. Bavaro, so upon my return I decided to contribute as well.I sent the resort an e-mail about a week before arrival asking for a newly refurbished room, with a king size bed, and close to the beach and pool. I was actually surprised when upon arrival, this is exactly the room that they had ready for us and even referred to my e-mail! The front desk people were very nice, spoke good English and had us checked in in less than 5 minutes. The resort itself is very nice - you almost feel like you are in a tropical paradise. The room was excellent - felt new, was very clean, no smells of any kind, the AC worked well, and the bathroom was excellent. The pool, however, could use a face lift. The paint on the bottom is missing in a number of places and it just does not look that great.The beach was excellent - lots of palapas (never a need to reserve in advance), nice white sand. The water, however, was very dirty - lots of garbage floating (plastic bags, etc.) and lots of sea weeds. Coulld be the time of the year, I do not know.The food was fairly good as well, especially for an all inclusive resort. However, you are only allowed to make 3 reservations (if you are staying for 7 nights) for the specialty restaurants. We went to the French, Mediterranean and Japanese. We liked the first two, but Japanese was very weak (for someone from New York), and the service was bad. The buffett itself was great on most nights. It was impossible to get into the specialty restaurants for the other nights. They tell you to call and check on cancellations, but each time I called there were none. Yet, when we went to our restaurants, they were half empty. This I simply do not understand. Also, they only had two specialty restaurants open each night.The evening shows were pretty bad. A few were funny (where they made use of the guests), but others (where they actually tried to put on a show) were terrible and we walked out in the middle of many. Service can definitely be improved. They are way too laid back. On the day of out check out, I called and asked for the bags to be picked up and no one ever showed up. Overall - decent resort to go to, good food, nice beach and OK service. Could be much better though. Personally, I will not return there.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

<Content>The Best Vacation in Years, Sykesville, MD, USA I recently stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from Oct. 17-24, 2008.From the beginning of the trip on USA3000 airlines to the return flight were no hassle and very easy. The staff at the hotel were more than accomodating. The food was awesome and the rooms were decent. It had been several years since I had taken a vacation. We had young children in our group and they had plenty to do. The grounds were impecable as was the dining service. I enjoyed meeting a really fun family from Amsterdam and even ran into friends from my home town. The star friends were outstanding and helped to provide a means for people of all countries and languages to come together and have a great time. I plan on returning next year the same time as the weather was perfect. I highly recommend this hotel to all.

<Content>Nice honeymoon vacation At first I was hesitant to vacation in Dominican Republic, once we arrived it was nice. We flew from Charlotte, NC to Punta Cana. When we arrived in Punta Cana there were several people wanting to help with your bags. Make sure that the person is affiliated with your travel agency. We booked through GO-GO tours, down there Prieto Tours handles everything. The busride from the airport to the resort was about 25-30 minutes. You will travel through some run down areas of the country. There are alot of mopeds and pedestrian traffic. Once at the resort, it was completely different. It was clean and the staff was very friendly. At check in they place a tag on your luggage and it is taken to your room. After checking in, I would suggest going to the desk next to check in to get you dinner reservations for the week. They have a breakfast buffet from 0630-1000. From 1000-Noon is small buffet at the pool. Lunch starts around 1230-530 or so. The buffets always had a variety of food, there was always something that I like on the buffet. Each day had a different theme of food, but they had hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken and steak everyday. Dinner is served in buffet style from 6-10 or in a variety of restruants (you have to have a reservation for those. This is an all inclusive resort; food, snacks, drinks and alcohol is all included. I would recommend leaving gratuity some. My wife and I tipped the waiter at breakfast and dinner, Prieto Tours has a rep on site during the week. Our rep was Saul. He was a very big help. He arranged everything for you as far as transport back and any excursions you might want to do. We didnt leave the resort but if you do, I would recommend taking a taxi that the resort called or going on an excursion through your rep. I did a local dive through the on site dive shop, it was a fairly good reef dive to 36-38 feet. Visibility was 15-20. Current was kinda strong in places. The room was decent size, wasnt a large room, but enough for only 2 people. The pool was right behind our room. There is a 24/7 room service. The room does have a safe. The biggest flaw I found was that the ocean was bad about debris floating on shore. Not really anything the resort can do about that, they did try to keep it cleaned up. If you know some spanish, it helps out. The exchange rate from pesos to US Dollars is also something to be familiar with. At the end of the week, Prieto Tours transported us back to the airport. Once you go through security there are several shops and stores. There is a Wendys and a Pizza place. Wendys was kinda expensive.

<Content>Great Honeymoon!! My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous honeymoon! We stayed at the resort from October 12-19. We booked through Apple Vacations and the process could not have been been any smoother. We always felt like we had someone there for us in case of any issues. I have been to may islands and I must say that with combined beauty and value the Dominican Republican is the best! The room was great with the musty odor being noticeable but not overpowering. I read about that on this site beforehand and brought a bath and body works mini room freshner with me. The pool, swim-up bar, and the beach were the best!! We also loved the personalities of the bartenders that worked at the lobby bar. The food far exceeded my expectations. I felt that everything was fresh and the variety was impressive. When we arrived we were only guaranteed 3 reservations for dinner during a 7 night stay but each afternoon around 3:00pm we would check with the concierge to see if any reservations cancelled and we were able to book restaruants for 5 of our 7 nights. My husband loved the Cajun restaurant and my favorite was the Japanese restaurant. I thought the sushi and tempura were fabulous. With the dinner buffet, on Friday nights they have lobster and I thought it was delicous! We also ordered room service several days and while the menu was limited, we ordered the chicken nuggets each time and they really were delicious. We always received our food within 15-20 minutes of calling.The best tip we could have received would be to bring a lot of $1 and $2 dollar bills. We brought $75 in small bills and for the week we probably could have used about $100-$125. We tipped the housekeeper $2 daily, at the bar we would give $1 after each round of drinks, and we would tip $3-$5 for the formal dinners in the restaurant and $1-$2 for the buffets. Americans were in the minority at the resort- there were a lot of German, French, English, and Spanish-speaking guests and typically European countries do not tip. You never felt like you had to tip and it was always so appreciated.We did two excursions which included the Bavaro Splash which was the mini speed boats and it was a lot of fun. We also did a dune buggy/horseback ride which was great but there were so many people in our group that we had to go pretty slow and stay in a line. If any of you decide to do the dune buggy or ATV excursions, bring a bandanna with you from home. There is a lot of dust//manure that flys up and on-site the place charges us $5 per bandana or 2 for $8. Another reason to take small bills- We only had a $10 bill and were told that they do not have singles even though I saw her accept several $1 bills! When you are outside of the resort you really do need exact change or you may find yourself short-changed.Overall- great experience, great hotel, loved it and cannot wait to go back!

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro - Great, Relaxing, Will Return We selected the Iberostar Bavaro after a thorough review of various hotels listed for Punta Cana, using both Trip Advisor and the hotel web sites. We were looking for the quality of accomodations, food choices, beach access and quality and activities such as sailing.We found everything to be as mentioned/advertised - with only one exception - the distance from the airport ot the hotel is not 15 minutes - closer to 45 mins - but that is a small issue in the scheme of the overall experience. This Iberostar property has 3 tighly knit resorts at this location you are free to use and eat/drink at all 3. The major differentiator is the accomodations and the size of the grounds. We also suspect we had better access to the specialty resturants - as we ate in those 6 of the 7 nights, when the brouchere states one would get 3 specialty dinner reservations over a 7 night stay and we made them all the first afternoon (no waiting to sign up each morning as at other resosrts in the area) . The rooms at the Bavaro are much larger and higher quality than those at the more hotel like ones at the sister properties and that is the major factor in the price difference. The beach was excellent and well maintained (raked every morning) and the service was excellent, including beach side drink ordering if you liked).The staff was well trained and friendly and treated us well and provided assistance without requesting it. We will return in the future.

<Content>Fantastic Family Holiday We have just come back from an amazing holiday at the Iberostar. This will be our 3rd Iberostar in the Dominican and it's by far one of the best. From check in to check out the whole holiday went without any hitches.There were 5 of us, my husband and I and 3 of our children, youngest 1 then 6 then 13.Not much for the 13 year old to do but he just wanted to chill and relax anyway. Abi was out at the kids club for a lot of the time and jason obviously stayed with us.The rooms are fabulous and we had interconnecting ones so had some peace! Rooms, grounds and hotel are kept to an impecable standard, the Star Friends are fantastic entertainers and make you feel very special. Food at the buffet is huge, with a massive choice and food made for you if you ask for it a special way. Nothing is too much trouble and everyone came home very relaxed.We'll book it again to go for just the two of us to relax!

<Content>Great week at the bavaro We just returned from the bavaro and let me start off by saying this is a great resort. We did not expierence a lot of things other people have written about. Our room didn't smell like mildew and the air worked great. If you leave the door open the air shuts off so we just keeped the door shut. My only complaint with the room would be the shower, when you turned the water on the whole bathroom got wet.   They were doing a lot of constuction around the property. The lobby was half closed. I am sure it is going to be beautiful when it done. The grounds were immaculate and there was always someone cleaning or gardening.  We found the food to be great and I am not a person who really likes buffets.The food was very fresh and presented amazing. If I can change one thing about this resort it would be making reservations for dinner. I went right away to make our dinner plans and were told the only openings were at 9:00 P.M. well that wasn't going to work for us since we had our 5 year old with us. I asked to speak to the manager and she found us reservations at 6:30. We heard a lot of people complain about the same thing and we all laughed because the restaurants were half empty every night.  The staff here is amazing. We diid tip our housekeeper every day and a lot of the other staff, they deserve it they work very hard.   The beach and pool were great and never a problem getting a chair. Be careful around the pool it gets slippery if you are not wearing rubber soles. We saw a lady fall and break her ankle.   Outside entertainment was alot of fun. Henry , P.J. and Isabel are the best. There is a lot for kids to do. Our 5 year old hasn't stopped talking about our vacation. I would highly recommend this hotel if you want great service, great food, amazing beach and just a wonerful vacation.

<Content>Great place Stayed in IB for 10 days, it is excellent place. Service is very good and people especially in Los Haitises restaurant very friendly. The theme restaurants were OK, still the best food was in Los Haitises. As compared to a stay in a presumably more luxurious Paradisus Punta Cana in their Reserve section, IB is way better. Service is quicker, more relaxed and not pompous. Food has great variety. Always fresh fruits. The only thing they should change is the medical center staffing. I was there for minor indigestion but I was at the time taking some medications. They were afraid to treat me and send me to the clinic for examination. Nevertheless they charged for their services over 200 USD. They either shouold not charge and send me immediately or treat me and not send.

<Content>Bavaro excellence - September 28th, 2008 My husband and I recently returned from Staying at the Iberostar Bavaro. Two years ago we stayed at Riu Palace just down the beach and we had geat time and a friend recommended to stay at an Iberostar. I am so glad we followed her recommendation. Two weeks before we got there I emailed them and told them it was our anniversary and could we have a room close to the beach. Not only did we get a room right on the beach, but it was also right next to the pool. Room 2336. We couldn't have asked for a better location!Our room was beautiful. We found out how to turn down the air conditioning, the dial was hidden. Yes, it was a little bit musty, but everyone who has been to the Carribean knows this is very common. The only thing is I was disappointed in the tv channels. We had peacocks on our patio.The food at the buffet was great. There was a different main coarse each night and there was plenty of choices. The pickles were to die for! We had lobster on Friday night and it was unlimited. Felix, our waiter most the nights, always had my champagne ready for me. The Japaneze was very good. We canceled our Gourmet, but I wish we hadn't. Everyone said it was the best!The Broadway show at night was very good, the rest were just ok.The drinks were much larger than the Riu's, so you didn't have to ask for 2 at a time.I will go back to Iberostar again and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants a vacation to do nothing but relax. It was one of the best vacations we have been on. Now, the flight back was a different story! It took us 2 days to get home when it should have taken 6 hours.

<Content>Love the Bavaro - my 2nd time around too!! I stayed at Iberostar Bavaro in 2005 and was determined to stay at another resort when returning to the DR with my husband this year. BUT, I had such great memories and the reviews were still praising the resort so we decided to book there. It was the best decision. The rooms are still very large and spacious. The grounds are georgeous and super clean. It also had some new restaurants so that was a treat. Our favorite restaurant was hands-down the Japanese restaurant. You can dine at any of the restaurants at the three Iberostar resorts so we also liked the restaurant near the beach (maybe it was called Tropical) at the resort next door. Hint: you only get a few vouchers to eat at the restaurants during your stay, but if you check with the reservation desk after 3pm each day, they always have extra vouchers for restaurants that still have availability. My husband and I didn't end up eating that the buffet once.We decided to get Open Water PADI certified while there. ...something I never thought I would do. The staff was amazing and made me feel at ease through every task. We worked mostly with Cris and Vanessa and they were fabulous instructors! The course only takes 3.5 days so it was nice and short.

<Content>OMG this hotel was amazing.! this hotel was great and the staff was amazing.! Im 16 years old and my sister is 13, and we traveled with our parents. And this is a all inclusive (joke with the staff) is a great resort for everyone. room-Conveinent (spell?) to my mom we got connecting rooms which was easy to get inbetween ours and our parents rooms. I thought the beds were really comfertable and we got good night sleeps, and the maid service was amazing and everyday we came home to a clean room with flowers and chocolates. pool  beach-the beach was really pretty and the water was basically air temp. the only thing is for people who havent traveld or dont live in europe, may be offeneded by the topless beach goers. There was plenty of things to do on the beach like volleyball and snorkling, windsurfing, kyaking and much more. The pool was awsome and had activites to do as well as a pool side bar. the towels were convient because you could trade in yours anytime you wanted a fresh one. It was really clean as well and lunch is pool side.food-breakfast is a buffet but its like art and for dinner as well. the way they set it up is basically set for a picture.! the food at the buffet is good because they have so many things to choose from and an amazing dessert. the resturants are okay, they have cajun, mediterainian, and japanese and alot of other things. supprisingly the resutants arent that good, and becareful THEY DONT CLEAN THE SHRIMP, my sister and i are vegitarians and it actually was wast to find food, even without the shrimp. another great thing is that there is ALWAYS food.! if you miss a meal, there always is food by the pool.staff and entertainment-i CANNOT say enough good things about them.! they were the ones to make this vacation as great as it is.! There is always things to do during the day and the star friends always try to get people out of their comfort zone to participate, in a great way. Spagetti, pikachu, j.p, trebelin, and henry just to name a few were so funny always up for a laugh for example, dressing up in makeup and bikinis to take pictures with the guests on the beach.! the night shows were the BEST time of the day, both funny and dancing your mouth is either smiling, laughing, or just open with suprise.excursions and airport travel-the day excursions were fun but we only did the half day ones which pretty much took up a whole day. The only thing was the roads arent very developed so its a bumpy ride, same with the two and from airports. But it was all worth it.Overall it was a great trip.! we met people from all different places and all different ages.! i highly recommend this to anyone who wants an amazing vacation.!

<Content>THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!! My wife and I recently went to Punta Cana for our honeymoon. We wer originally scheduled to stay at Dreams, but since a road was flooded we were booked for one night at Iberostar Bavaro. The next day we went to Dreams and didn't like it. We paid some extra money to come back to Ibersotar Bavaro because we liked it so much!I'll try to be thorough so that this will be helpful for you - after all, if you are thinking about going to the Dominican, it is likely a big decision for you. To start with, the room was very nice, very clean, very comfortable and inviting. The staff: AWESOME! I would say that over 90% of the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The staff is a huge reason why we will return to this resort. As for the beach, it was beautiful! Soft, white sand with extremely pretty blue-green water and nice cabanas everywhere with some shade (in case you don't want to get burnt in the direct sunlight). Also, the pool is big and beautiful and has a very nice swim-up bar.The food choices were abundant and very good. It is impossible to go hungry at this resort. After a few days of overindulging in drinks and food, we finally 'toned it down' for fear of gaining a ton of weight! :) One of my concerns regarding the resort was the issue of restaurant reservations: I was concerned that we only got a few guaranteed reservations during the stay. Don't let that concern you. The main buffet that is almost always open has soooo much good food that it is not a concern. In fact, this buffet is just as good if not better than some of the restaurants. I would recommend the Japanese restaurant and the French restaurant. The French restaurant is very elegant and very romantic. Even if you have never tried French food, you should love this place. Most of the restaurants will also have a 3-person band sing to you and they're very charming.One of the nice things we liked at the resort was the entertainment. Every night around 9:30 p.m. there is a stage performance next to the main bar and it is usually quite entertaining. Our favorite performance was a Newlywed Game Show that was hysterical!One thing we liked about the resort was that it had a European influence. There were plenty of French, German, American and Latin citizens. For the most part, most of the people that stayed there appeared to be classy and polite. Most of the children we saw appeared to be well-mannered. We met alot of very nice people there who we will remain friends with once we return from vacation. Also, we had alot of fun beach volleyball games. One nice thing about this resort is that it is fairly close to the airport, so it doesn't take very long to get there.This place is a safe bet and everyone we met there was very happy to be there. I hope this proves helpful - this place is GREAT! :)

<Content>Beware of Sankies My family and I have stayed at the Bavaro resort a number of times. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, the rooms and public bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. The food was also very good. We initially loved the animation team and the entertainment they provided during our stays. We actually got pretty close with a couple of the guys. We heard all of the sad stories about their sick mothers, wrecked cars, difficulty providing for their families, broken phones, etc. After doing some research on the internet and talking with other tourists, we soon learned that these folks are big time scam artists. They normally prey on members of the opposite sex. They quickly put the moves on you, ask to maintain contact even after your vacation is over...and once they make that initial contact...let the scamming begin!!! They will make you think they are in love with you and can't think of anything else...Do your research on www.dr1.com and search sankies before you go...and no matter what, don't believe a word they say!!!!

<Content>Bavaro is EXCELLENT! My husband and I stayed at the IB sept 19th-26th and we had a wonderful time! The resort is absolutely beautiful. We have stayed at the IB paraiso Maya in Mexico and the IB Rose Hall in Jamaica before this trip and we both agreed that this was our favorite resort of the 3( of course we will be back to the others too. ) The people were extremely friendly. I was quite concerned after reading some other reviews, but was pleasantly surprised after being there. Neither one of us got sick, although we took some meds with us just in case, My husband even brushed his teeth with the water from the sink! The food was OK not the best and not the worst. We ate mostly from the buffet and we were ALWAYS able to find something to eat. The rooms were a little musty, but after a little time got used to it. The beaches are the BEST! The sand was so soft and the water was so beautiful! I'm 6 feet tall and could always see my feet and further in the water. All and all it was a wonderful vacation, and we are definitely going back!

<Content>Please, send management Mini-Disco clips Overall we had great stay. Nice Sandy Beach but gets very deep in 2 steps (fine for adults) - so bring those kids floaters鈥?that would allow kids to enjoy ocean safely (Speedos worked great for us). Could be just a temporary result of wind/weather combination as we were told that Catalonia and Dreams had flat sandy entrance into the ocean.Plenty of palapa's on the beach - never had to claim the spot in the morning before breakfast. Health Bar next to Kiddies鈥?Pool is great. Those Juices are much better than what regular bars serve :). Kiddies鈥?pool has a lot of shade around of it but deeper than I would have liked it to be if I had a toddler.Kids club - Open 9:30-16:45 and 1 hour after mini-disco (8:30pm-9:30pm). Average size, air-conditioned, toilets attached to the building but entrance is outside (excellent idea!!!), there is shaded trampoline next to kids club but it is not next to kiddies鈥?pool which usually works the best, playground on the beach relatively nearby. One of the girls - Rosa was GREAT with kids. It turned out she was doing great mini-disco at Iberostar Dominicana side. The girl in Bavaro didn't seem to have a clue or didn't really want to care on how mini-disco should be done... She just stayed next to the stage and danced by herself... She didn't try to organize kids or play any games with them...Several times they tried to shut down kid鈥檚 music after only 10-15 minutes.

<Content>Beautiful Resort Our stay at the Iberostar Bavaro was from Aug 30 to Sept 6, traveling with our grown son  daughter and their spouses. We鈥檝e stayed at a number of other Iberostar properties, but this was our first time at the Bavaro. A week or so before our trip, I emailed the resort to request rooms in the same block. Though I didn鈥檛 receive a response, everything was in order when we arrived. The front desk staff was very pleasant and we were greeted with a slushy drink. We immediately booked reservations at three a la carte restaurants. The lobby area is nicely decorated, though the bar is pretty plain. Our flight down was only about 25% occupied and the resort didn鈥檛 seem very crowded.Rooms  Housekeeping: Rooms were nicely decorated, but musty smelling. We were in room 2546, which was a great location and just a short walk to the pool, beach, and lobby. My son  daughter-in-law were disappointed to find two double beds, but called the front desk and housekeeping came later and pushed the beds together to make a super large king bed. As repeat IB customers, we found a bottle of rum and plates of pastries and fruit on arrival. Our rooms didn鈥檛 have flat screen televisions, but TV is pretty limited and that鈥檚 not what we were there for! The rooms were kept spotlessly clean and decorated daily with flowers. The maid was very pleasant and always greeted us enthusiastically when we saw her. We tipped $3-5 dollars every day. Rooms were cleaned early in the day. The only slip-up was on the last day we didn鈥檛 get any bath towels. I called the front desk, but towels never arrived. The towel art bird on the coffee table saved the day and my husband used his beach towel. I was able to get towels from the maid first thing in the morning so we could shower before heading to the airport. Our only complaint about the room was the moldy smell and the weak air-conditioning. . The temp stayed around 80F the whole time and was really humid, which explains the moldy smell. Definitely bring air freshener for your room and dryer sheets to stash in the closet and suitcases. The odor in our clothes washed out, so not that big a deal.Grounds  Public Areas: The grounds are gorgeous! The Bavaro is a tropical paradise with natural ponds, lush landscaping, and a variety of birds鈥攑eacocks, ducks, egrets, and flamingos. Someone is always working on pruning, painting, repairing, cleaning, etc. The public restrooms are immaculate. Just about every time I used the restroom at the beach, someone was cleaning it.Beach: The beach is one of the most beautiful anywhere in the Caribbean--wide with a gradual slope. Someone was constantly grooming the beach, sweeping up cigarette buts and trash. We had no problems getting our favorite palapas everyday. I was usually on the beach before 9, but there were still palapas available later in the day. We hung out near the beach bar, so it wasn鈥檛 a far walk to get a drink. There is no wait service at the beach or pool at the Bavaro. Restrooms are located nearby. Don鈥檛 miss the French fries at the beach bar. They鈥檙e even better than McDonald鈥檚!Pool: The pool was nice enough but not huge or opulent like at other resorts and the water was surprisingly cool and refreshing. The pool bar was nice, but would be nicer if it was adults only. I don鈥檛 like sharing the bar with infants and toddlers in floaties.Food: I would rate the food at the Bavaro at the top of the all-inclusives we鈥檝e visited. Chefs took pride in their elaborate food and veggie carvings that decorated the buffets. Service was a little iffy. Most waiters were extremely friendly and talkative, some seemed aloof, but maybe a result of the language barrier. None in our party got sick from the food except from over-indulging. We ate at four of the restaurants: Le Couple (Gourmet) was fantastic. The fillet was one of the best I鈥檝e had ever and the lobster 鈥渟alad鈥?is excellent. The Cajun was good, but the wait staff had a bit of an attitude. My blackened grouper was delicious. The jambalaya was not what we鈥檝e been used to, but my husband liked it. The Star Rock Caf茅 was a major disappointment. Food was average鈥攕trange menu for an 鈥淎merican鈥?restaurant. We expected I didn鈥檛 enjoy the cigarette smoke. The Mediterranean was good with mainly seafood on the menu. We enjoyed the appetizer buffet more than the entrees. The main buffet was very good, with lots to choose from. Breakfast was excellent with just about any standard breakfast item you could think of plus the European favorites like meats and cheeses as well. Pastries  breads were to die for. The fresh fruit was excellent, especially the mango. Foods were labeled and kept at the appropriate temperature. Dinner also had lots of choices. Even the pickiest eater could find something to eat. The fish was delicious and there was always a carving station with pork, beef, etc. On Friday they had lobster, which was a little disappointing. We enjoyed the beach buffet for lunch. Twice during the week they had beach parties, one day with barbecue steak and chicken, another with paella. Other days they alternated themes鈥擨talian, Chinese, Dominican, Mexican. There were always hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken and pasta dishes. Again, even picky eaters could find something and the variety was nice, so you didn鈥檛 feel like you had to eat the same thing every day.Activities: There was plenty to do, but we didn鈥檛 participate much. Star Friends were friendly but not pushy in getting people to take part. My daughter, daughter-in-law and I had massages one rainy day. My massage was the best I鈥檝e had at a resort and the prices ($50/hr) were reasonable. Weather: We had two days of rain thanks to TS Hanna, but we still went to the beach and had a great time. The resort provided nice golf umbrellas for us to use on the rainy days. The rest of our week was beautiful with temps in the 80鈥檚 and not as humid as Mexico during the same time of year.Once again, Iberostar has proven to be a good value with consistent ambiance, service and food. I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Useful Hospital Info We vacationed at the Iberostar Bavaro in August. The resort is absolutely beautiful and staff extremely friendly. The immaculately kept grounds with roaming peacocks provide excellent diversion from the beach and pool (as if one needs a diversion from the breathtakingly gorgeous beach). Our 2-year-old also enjoys the little pirate-themed playground. Based on my experience, all the positive comments I read here is true. The only complaint we have is that the marble bathroom floor can be very slippery when wet because the floor mat is way too small. I slipped and fell while holding my son 鈥?he got a slight fracture on his collar bone! While we were there, our 2-year old also developed an ear-infection. The front desk sent a golf-cart to take us to the onsite medical center. The nurse at the center confirmed the ear infection. Since she couldn鈥檛 write prescription for antibiotic, she produced a detailed report and called a cab for us to go to the local hospital. The hospital, Hospiten Bavaro, caters specifically to tourists so the staff all speaks excellent English. The facility is clean, calm, modern and quite adequate. We only waited a short time before the pediatrician showed up. She examined my son, confirmed the ear infection diagnose and dispensed antibiotics with detailed instruction. She also wrote a prescription for us to take on the return trip in case the airport security has question regarding the medication. The entire process is as smooth as it can be even by American standards. Here are some additional details:鈥?The fee for the Iberostar onsite medical consultation is $90 for regular hours and $125 for after hours. If you think you will need antibiotics or any prescription-strength medicine, just go straight to the hospital. 鈥?The cab fare from hotel to hospital is $26 one-way. It takes about 30 minutes and does go through some poor parts of the town.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------鈥?The hospital is called Hospiten Bavaro. *** Address: Hospiten Bavaro, Carretera Hig眉ey - Punta Cana. *** Phone number: +1 (809) 686 14 14. *** Website: http://www.hospiten.es/hospiten/HOSPITEN/published_en/DEFAULT/con_hospitales.jsp?CATID=77PRDID=2065--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------鈥?The hospital does not accept American health insurance. The doctor鈥檚 fee was $220 and Antibiotic (Augmentin) was $24. They accept cash and major credit cards. Our little boy was much better shortly after taking the antibiotic. Later that day, the housekeeper brought a delightful little flower arrangement for him. It was very sweet.  Obviously we did not enjoy our vacation as much as we anticipated, but we would definitely recommend this resort to family and friends. We would just caution them to through down a big bath towel on the floor when they first enter the bathroom!

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro - Wonderful Stay!!! Our group of three stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro Resort from July 12- 28, 2008. Usually we stay at RIU Resorts, but we decided to try Iberostar this time simply for a change of pace. We were not disappointed! Karen at the Bavaro reception desk was very friendly, as was James who made all of our dinner reservations the morning after our arrival. Our travel agent called ahead for us and requested a newly refurbished room close to the beach and the pool. Karen assigned us room #1292 which was perfect. We were literally steps from the beach and a very short walk from the pool area! There was plenty of room for us in the suite with two double beds, and a couch in the sitting area that opened out to a bed. There was also a patio which faced the courtyard that had a table and sitting area. Maid service was excellent. They always brought us extra towels and used flowers from the outside landscaping to decorate our room. We tipped our maid daily and left them little candies. The resort grounds are beautiful and well maintained, with families of peacocks roaming free. The beach is lovely, with soft white sand perfect for walking and lounging. We enjoyed being able to roam around the other resorts in the Iberostar complex, but our hotel and stretch of beach was by far the nicest. We spent most of our days at the lively pool area and were thoroughly entertained by the Star Friends who went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Quimo, Spaghetti, Isabel, Yoana, J.P., Rodolfo, Wilson, Andy, Henry and Alvin were great fun. They got us involved in some of the activities around the pool and were constantly busy making sure that all guests had a good time. You can do stretching classes, water aerobics, step aerobics, pool games, beach games, Spanish lessons, salsa  merengue lessons, bingo, archery, rifle shooting鈥ou name it, it's there.At night there was live music and dancing before the evening show. The resort鈥檚 band was fantastic and played a good variety of music. For the main show there was either a professional dance show, or a show put on by the Star Friends. I actually preferred the shows performed by the Star Friends鈥?even though they were rather silly. I鈥檓 probably a little biased, but as a dance student, I found the dance skills and choreography of the professional shows to be somewhat lacking. They did, however, do a nice job with costuming, lighting and music.The food was O.K. for an all inclusive resort. We also went to many of the reservation restaurants in the complex. The steakhouse was the best one in our opinion, but they all were a nice alternative to the buffet. We were sure to tip all of the waiters in the restaurants, buffet, and the bar staff who served us. They all work really hard to give you good service. All in all we had a great stay, and would definitely recommend this resort to friends and family. We liked it because you can either do everything鈥r nothing at all, and still be in beautiful and comfortable surroundings.

<Content>5 Stars!! I've stayed at Iberostar Bavaro during August of 2006 and I must say... Excellent hotel. The complex is filled with exotic plants and pools. The rooms are very nice, ours had a view to Bavaro beach and to the pool. We had All-Inclusive which is great because it allow us to enjoy not only the buffet but also the different restaurants (to which you need to reserve a table in advance) - I recommend te Mexican Restaurant (and the Margeritas). In adition to the hotel, Bavaro beach (right in front of the hotel) is also a paradise come true, crystal blue (and warm) water and white sand... Everything that one could ask for a Caribbean beach. Overall, an excellent hotel that I recommend to everyone who wishes to enjoy the best of Punta Cana.

<Content>BEST STAFF EVER! We were a group of 20 people ages ranging from 28 to 65. Singles and couples. We went for a wedding- and stayed 8 days-during hurricane season. Dodged Hana and Ike- it poured rain for two days (almost 20 inches) and was cloudy with light showers on and off a few days. When it poured the staff delivered very large umbrellas for us to use during our stay and they had golf carts pick us up to take us wherever we wanted to go! Couldn't believe the service and always with a smile. Truly the hardest working staff I have ever experienced (and I am well travelled at exclusive resorts). This property is absolutely beautiful and very well maintained, every area is spot less and grounds manicured to perfection. The pictures of the resort do not do it justice! The amenities, room size, and food and beverage choices make this all-inclusive a steal! Bar service is great, cold Presidente Beer on Tap as well as Bohemia Especial and Brahama Bottled Beer, Stoli Vodka, Johnny Walker Red Label Scotch, Frangelica, Tangueray Gin - were available and teriffic tropical Rum and Vodka concoctions. I was pleasantly surprised at the beverage service. Specialty drinks of the day and even Specialty drinks of the evening - including coffee drinks with Irish whisky, Kahlua, Amaretto etc. White and Red wine available also - not great but ok for dinner.Rooms were large with very comfortable beds and great linens, towels plush, refrigerator stocked daily with beer, soda, bottled sparkling and regular water, nice coffee butler, Great shower and separate bathtub, comfortable patio,(even had a expandable rack for wet bathing suits and T- shirts) nice views of the gardens and/or beach. Maid service was exceptional! Specialty restaurants for dinner are your best choice, The Gourmet Restaurant was the best, the Mediterranean , Cajun,and Japanese were also quite good. Steakhouse meat was very salty - might have been the tenderizer - or maybe that is just the way they prepare their steaks. Very dissappointed in the lobster and langostinos as I had heard the D.R. is famous for these. (yuck). Great shrimp and muscle dishes. Men take note you must wear long pants to all the specialty restaurants (except the steakhouse) and sleved shirts to all restaurants including the buffets. Buffet is fine for breakfast and dinner with the usual fare- pool buffet area is great for brunch/lunch. Special themed meals everyday at the buffet- Italian, Spain, Asian, Dominican in addition to the usual fare. Great cheese bars at the buffets (inside and outside). Ice cream stations, soft serve and hand scouped , Good salad bars and fresh fruit. And no one got sick from the food or water . Tip- (NEVER drink the tap water- or brush your teeth with it ) All water and ice is filtered so you are fine with all beverages and food). Met people from all over the world - some could communicate quite well in English - that was half of the fun. You have to have an open mind, be patient, and adventurous and you will have a Great time. If you know a little Spanish that is even better. Tip all the workers whenever you can- a couple of bucks goes a long way and they work so hard it is a crime. Our biggest ddisappointment was the Casino (at the sister hotel next door) the staff are NOT friendly - actually seem cold and hurried- found out later apparently the women dealers are not allowed to cajole with the guests. The entertainment is awful - worse than on a cruise ship - but we didn't expect anything - the players work very hard and really try to engae the audience. Again, it is what you make of it! Another very important tip- don't forget tp use mosquito repellant in the evening - we all forgot the first night we were there - and were covered with bites - the repellant worked wonders when we remembered to put it on the rest of the evenings- Went on a few tours - Outback Safari was outstanding - definitely not for small children- constantly offerring beer and rum drinks (maybe they tailor it to their guests) Really fun and educational way to learn about the island, people, government, plantations, living conditions, schools, etc. Stingray and Sharks - fun if you haven't experienced that beforeATV - dittoOur other scheduled tours were cancelled due to the rainsLet your hair down, don't be too critical, keep in mind the great price you are paying, enjoy the beautiful setting and have a blast !

<Content>WONDERFUL!!! The resort was wonderful. All of the staff was very nice and took care of everything. My husband and I went with our 19 month old son, my parents, and my brother. The rooms were very clean and the maid service even arranged my sons diapers in order on the tables. All of the staff was exceptionally nice to my son and there were many activities for him. The food was wonderful also. The variety was amazing.

<Content>Lovely Me and my boyfriend stayed at the iberostar as we didnt know anything about the country and the travel agentrecomended we stayed at a branded hotel just to keep us at peace that we were going to a secure place. It was absolutelylovely.The beach was the best we had ever seen and the staff did an amazing job, well done to all of them. we spentmost of our time in the hotels beach and only ever went out once as the hotel had everything we needed. The food was excellentgot a chance to try some local specialties but cant remember any names. The holiday worked out cheaper than what we expectedand we didnt spent that much money while there at all.

<Content>Does Not Disappoint! We were very happy with this resort. The hotel staff was very friendly, the beach was beautiful, the ocean was the perfect temperature. We spent a lot of time at the swim-up bar and never felt crowded. The rooms were clean and big and beautiful. Even the cheesy evening entertainment we really enjoyed because the star friends are so funny and energetic (you must be sure to meet J.P., he's wonderful!). The restaurants are fabulous, too. We had no problems getting reservations this time of year, so we didn't even get a chance to try the regular buffet for dinner. We ate the salads and drank the table water the hotel provides and suffered no ill effects at all.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone. The prices are extremely affordable for what you get.Only problems we had were that August of course is very humid down there, and we're not used to it. The air conditioning in our room only cooled it down to 80 degrees, although I'm sure they would have switched our room if we had asked, but we were already unpacked and spread out. Other people said their A/C was fine. Also, my friend was bothered by the footsteps of the people staying in the second floor of our bungalow, and I was woken up one morning as well. The tile floors can really carry sound if high-heels are worn.

<Content>Noisy start, but great finish! After dealing with the water issue at the Riu for about 24 hours, (Riu Palace Macao review posted), I can't tell you how happy we were to arrive at the I.B. check-in counter around 2:30 that Tuesday. All I can say is...it had been a very long day. Coming from someone who really gets into researching prior to a trip, I would describe being moved to a resort I knew nothing about a little nerve racking. What a nice lobby. Our welcome was warm, and a refreshing beverage was offered. We were told to grab something to eat and a room should be ready for us by the time we returned. This was our first chance to get a good look at this place and see just how beautiful it is. The hotel rooms, (more like villas) are surrounded by flowers, green grass, and palm trees. Straight ahead we could see the lovely pool, swim-up bar included. Very nice. Then on to the beach, which was loaded with lounge chairs, and gorgeous. We couldn't help compare it to the Riu and unanimously agreed this was an upgrade in the surroundings category hands down. Around 4:00-off to our room. Finally we will be settled and unpacked once and for all. So we thought...The more we walked, the louder things got. Yes, we couldn't believe it...they actually gave us a room right smack next to the construction zone. Did we know there was a construction zone? No. With a king bed for 3 adults...accompanied by the jackhammer, we immediately called the front desk and said the room was not going to work for us. Long story short, we were told they could move us the following day, and they set up another single bed for us. Suggestion...if this was the ONLY room available, explain this upon check-in and say we can move you tomorrow. We would have been fine with that. After everything we had dealt with at the Riu, this was a disappointment. Like I said...it had been a very long day. Knowing we would be packing up once again tomorrow, we unpacked just the necessities, and threw our suits on to squeeze in some vacation time. Hanging out on this beautiful beach was great.We were able to make ALL of our dinner reservations for the rest of the week right after checking-in. If reservations are required for specialty restaurants, this is how it should be done-quick and easy! Nice.Japanese was up first, and it ended up being one of our favorite dinners. The place is decorated beautifully, service was great and so was the food. We were all very tired so we called it a night pretty early. ( FYI...construction did not end until 9PM)Wednesday morning arrived with the sounds of a jackhammer at 7AM. Did we really want to go through packing and moving again? Absolutely. I figured I was awake so why not go down to the front desk and confirm it. I was told to check back around 1:00-no room yet...They said we could just call the front desk after that and we did so several times and were told due to a delayed flight, it wouldn't be available until 5PM. Finally they assigned us another room, (#1213), which was an excellent location with pool view. Worth the wait? Yes. This room had 2 doubles, and they set up another single for us. Unpacked and suitcases put away for good-Perfect!The suites are laid out very nice with plenty of room to relax. The bathroom is modern and clean with separate shower and bathtub.Mornings started with a great breakfast. Your choice of freshly made omelets, (real eggs!), fabulous fruit, pancakes, french toast, etc...the food was really very good. Nice selections and always a clean table to sit at. Lunch was spent at the pool restaurant. Highlights were the fresh mangoes, pizzas, salad bar, cheese selections, mexican station choices including nachos, along with pasta dishes and many grilled foods such as chicken and burgers. The fresh carrots were a favorite of mine. Desserts we enjoyed were the bananas with chocolate sauce, brownies, and ice cream.Another favorite for dinner was the buffet. They were cooking up grilled lobster, and grilled prawns-Delicious!! You could also have them grill you a steak, or make a fresh pasta dish for you with your choice of vegetables, and sauces. The Gourmet Restaurant was a disappointment, with the exception of the lobster salad, and we didn't care for the Mediterranean Restaurant at all. When it comes to service this place gets high marks including maid, bar and staff. These folks work hard, and are very friendly.Sailing is something we love to do, so we enjoyed taking the catamaran out at both resorts and my husband enjoyed kayaking. Sailing was much more enjoyable at the I.B. since there is not as much motor boat traffic. It's all around you at the Riu for some reason, so you end up smelling fumes and trying to steer away from parasail lines. If you are a spa lover, book some appointments upon check-in so you can get your pick of times. My daughter and I booked body treatments for the day before heading home, and after a week of sun this was wonderful. (exfoliation and aromatic massage)These ladies are small but mighty! We started off rocky yes, but what a wonderful time we had at this place. All of us would return to this resort. Next time we hope to bring others with us just to show this place off-Loved it!.

<Content>Our second year in a row We love the Iberostar chain of hotels. We have stayed both in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. This is our 2nd time at the Bavaro and we love it! We were a group of seven and we all have nothing but positive things to say. The staff all go the extra mile for their guests. Two outstanding employees are Anlly and Zamora in the Buffet Restaurant. Looking forward to returning and possibly staying in the new adult only hotel currently being built. Love the DR and its people!

<Content>Had a great time I was at the Iberostar Bavaro with friends and family. Everyone we traveled with was 19 and older and I must say I am happy we chose the Bavaro. Alot less young kids and most of the beach and crazy activities were next door at the dominican so basically our hotel was very relaxing. Check in went smoothly. Hector at the front desk was great. Our rooms honestly were a bit smaller then I was expecting but very clean , nice and AC worked great. The repfrom Go Go another Hector was also great. We did Zip Lining which was great and the caribean festival catamaran. We swam with sharks and sting rays. If you are looking for a party boat, don't waste your money, if you want to experience the sharks and sting rays this is a good one if not try the all day snorkel, scuba and bbq one. A few went on the ATVs and loved it, but a bit more dangerous. We loved the beach Bar and julio mayo and Noe. At night there is not much Adult entertainment. The 19 year olds and the 22 yearolds went to the Star rock cafe at night. They met alot of people there. We went in early. Very long days with scuba and excursions. We ate mostly at the buffet that had great choices. The steak house and japaneese restaurants were great. Make your reservations as soon as you get there. Make sure you bring plenty of sun tan lotion-very expensive in the gift shop. Also bring comfy shoes, ALOT of walking, take advantage of the golf carts to bring you to the other hotels at night. They will also drop you right off at your room if you ask. Also it really doesn't matter where your room is located, each section has its benefits. We were in 1317 upper unit, directly behind the beach bar, for us that was great. If you are traveling with younger kids you might want your rooms closer to the Dominica for the pool and beach activities. Also it was verrry HOT. Don't go crazy worrying about fancy evening wear, pack as little as possible and bring a clip for the hair. All the employees there could not have done more or been nicer. Don't be afraid and Book now.One suggestion to the hotel. Please build one lounge that has AC. I like a nice glass of wine in the evening and would like a bit of AC with it. (other then the casino bar a bit smokey for non smokers)

<Content>A wonderful relaxing vacation I loved this resort. I went with my family and some friends to the Iberostar Bavaro and we just got back yesterday. We had the best time. The food was great and non-stop. The drinks wereexcellent (the pool even has a swim up bar). The rooms were large and well appointed. There was a slight musty odor when we would first enter the room but after that I didn't notice eat any longer. The room was cool at night and the mini-bar was well stocked. Just leave a note and tell the maid what you want for the refrigerator. The service people were courteous and very efficient, but it definitely helped that I spoke Spanish. The pool is amazing and doesn't get that crowded. The beach is beautiful and very clean. The shows were very well done but the Miss Iberostar got a little silly. My kids loved everything about this place, and my husband and I actually got a chance to RELAX!!!!We brought plenty of singles with us so that we could tip the hotel staff for the great job they did. There is a mini-disco for the kids at 8:00 each night . It lasts until about 8:30. We didn't do any of the excursions, but there was plenty to do at the hotel. This vacation surpassed all of my expectations and my family and I really had an amazing time. Use lots of sun-screen so that you don't get burned by the sun and reapply as necessary. The steak restaurant was excellent. Enjoy the experience. I would not hesitate to stay at this resort again.

<Content>Absolutely perfect, until the end I recently retured from an amazing holiday to the Iberostar Dominicana. (We travelled from Gatwick) It was my 4th year running to the carrabean and 2nd time to Domicn Republic, and was by far one of the best. We arrived at around 6 on 28th August and chackin was quick and easy and soon we were up in our room, settled in and in paradise. The weather: throughout our holiday was faultless. It rained rarely, and when it did, it was at night. There was a brief shower on one day however the temperature never dropped! Only go if you want a superb tan/burn on the first day! WEAR LOADS OF SUN CREAM!The trips: we went on were amazing (we went on the catameran- absolutlely amazing, the reef explorer [swam with sharks and stingrays on a floating island area in the sea!] - best trip we went on and finally the outbacksafari -were you witness amazing sites, but get a glimpse at the poverty in Dominican Republic.]Beach: amazing soft white sand, slightly chopy sea, but paradise overal. Loads of activities to do as well (volleyball, kayaking, paragliding etc)Pool: one of the cleanest, BIGGEST pools I have ever been in! Never dirty and never busy. Plenty of sunbeds and even if you are late out of bed, you will find some available.The hotel grounds: SPOTLESS. fabulous gardens and plants. Peacocks roam the grounds as well as flamingos in the water by the buffet!Food: Buffet was excellent with fabulous choice whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Beach buffet was a handy option but had slightly les choice that the buffet. Resteraunts were very good. I would advise you try out the oriental and steak house but I found the star rock cafe to have HUGE portions and the food was only OK. Mexican was basic but enjoyable. Snacks constantly available 24/7. Drink: Again, fabulous choice and available from the many bars or help-yourself places. Ice-cream parlour was LUXURY and I've never hear dof so many ice cream flavours!Room: Fabulous maids kept the room spotless. Ocassional wiff of sewage from the air conditioning :S but apart from that the room were ideal. The air-con never broke while we were there! (WHICH IS RARE in the hotels in the carrabean i have visited!) Room is always kept at a cool temperature so when you are hot and sweaty from a day of sunbathing, it is a calming relief to walk into the room!Entertainment: During the day the animation team offered a huge variety of activities including water polo, volleyball, archery, tabletennis etc, for all ages, absolutely free. In the evening there are a children's disco, amazing shows, and for 18+ there is a club open 11pm-3am. Near the end of the trip, a relative of mine became sick and ended up in hospital for the remaining few days of the holiday, which was a hugh let down. We found out he ha gastroenteritis, which could have been caused by something in the food, or water (however htel water is always purified for tourists to drink). He was JUST ABOUT fit to fly home and it was a huge let down to the holiday.Apart from the last part of the holiday, it was an amensly enjoable holiday. The all inclusive aspect to the hotel meant that money wasnt a worry and you cold have much food/drink as you want. A relaxing break away and I would advise anyone to visit this amazing hotel and spectacular country. Tips: SUN CREAM!, mosquito spray!, money for maids/waitor tips etc

<Content>19 yr old male's opinoin My family and I stayed for a week in early august.General:The temperature was in the mid 80's and it was very humid. There were many Europeans and people from Spanish speaking countries. Very unlike Mexico where virtually everyone speaks English. At night the sun goes down, but the temperature never drops.Room:After a quick check-in and getting to our rooms, our luggage arrived shortly after. The air conditioning didn't seem very cold, but after putting it on setting 1 (the coldest) it quickly cooled down. The room had two full sized beds and one couch set up with sheets to make a third. Inside the room was a mini bar that didn't seem very cold stocked daily with water beer and pop. The bathroom was nice, it had both a shower and a bathtub. Our room wasn't a far walk from anything, although it was right next to the construction. I could sometimes hear hammering noises in the morning it wasn't too bothersome. The worst thing was hearing a rooster (which roam free) crowing one morning.Food:The food was very good. There was somewhere to eat every day, I was never hungry the entire trip. I enjoyed the buffets and could have eaten every meal there. I ate at 3 of the restaurants: Japanese, steak house and cajun. Personally, I enjoyed the appetizers at the Japanese and cajun the most. The ribeye was great at the steakhouse. The service wasn't the best at these restaurants but didn't bother me much.Pool:The pool was a nice size and had a beach effect which I liked a lot. The swim up bar never seemed too crowded, resulting in fairly quick service. There were always open chairs but it was sometimes difficult to find spots for 5. Something I did not enjoy where swarms little kids screaming and running into people. It seemed as if their parents just let them run lose. Beach: The beach was very nice with ample seating. It was clean, but nothing compared to the beach in Cancun.Staff:The staff was amazing. They made virtually every request you made. Spaghetti was one of the greatest entertainers. He always remembered you.Entertainment:Some of the shows were very good. I preferred the ones with just the entertainers singing as opposed to the shows with audience participation. After the shows I frequently ventured to the casino, just a 3 min walk away, or 30 second golf cart ride. It was air conditioned. I was very surprised to see that it had poker. I visited the disco one night. I did not enjoy it seeing as it seemed to be filled heavily with Europeans and played only techno music.Conclusion:I enjoyed the trip very much, and would definitely go back with my family, but I don't think I would want to stay for more than a week, being that it was so hot and humid. This was a great place for relaxation, not somewhere for 18-30 year olds to party and get drunk.

<Content>Mixed experience at the Iberostar Bavaro After staying an Iberostar in Mexico last year, we choose to stay again at an Iberostar based on our experiences. Compared to the Iberostar Para铆so Lindo in Riviera Maya, the Bavaro isn't quite as good.AirportBreezed through customs in minutes and the walk from baggage to the shuttle company counters is literally feet. No need to pay someone to assist you with that. It took about 30-40 minutes though for our shuttle to be ready. That part seems a little chaotic.Returning to the airport 'porter' grabbed our bags before we could say no. This turned out to be a good thing. While it wasn't far from curbside to check-in, the airline counters weren't labels (overhead monitors were not turned on) and we wouldn't have know which ones were USAir. The porters also cut in line so our wait was much shorter than if we had been on our own.Ride to the resortWhile I've had some cab rides in the US that have been more hair-raising, the ride to the resort is something of an adventure. The first part is on a two lane, fairly straight highway but with no lines between lanes, no lights at crossing intersections and plenty of slow moving construction vehicles to have to pass, it can cause you to hold your breath at times.The second half of the ride is on a twisting local road with many potholes that our driver had to cross to the other side of the road to avoid.The resortIt's as beautiful and clean as all of the other reviewers state. There seems to always be someone sweeping leaves or dirt off the paths and the beach is swept throughout the day.RoomNice size but we never had more than 5 minutes of hot water in the shower per day and the mini-fridge never cooled beverages below luke-warm. Lost power twice in the room during the day (we were at the pool so it didn't impact us) and once during the night after we went to bed. Reminded us that we were in a 3rd world country.Pool/BeachPool is nice but not huge. If you want to sit in the shade, you'll have to get there before 9:00 so so. Beach is extremely nice; best sand I've ever seen. We headed to the beach after lunch each day and never had a problem finding spots in shade.FoodSomewhat disappointing overall. Breakfast was very good with anything you could imagine. Snacks at the pool were plentiful. Lunch and dinners at the buffets were ok as well. The buffet at the pool for lunch seemed to have a greater variety then did the main buffet.We ate at several of the specialty restaurants. The Japanese was the best of the bunch. The Cajun was disappointing as the meat was overcooked and tough. We were going to make reservations at the steak house but folks behind us in line said don't bother. In general we found the meat to be of poor quality (when compared to what we get here in the US) and overcooked. The Hard Star Cafe was ok as well.Check In/OutBoth took just minutes and went smoothly.OverallWe had a good time (family of 4 with 2 adults and 2 teenagers). Not as good as Mexico though. We didn't encounter any issues with the resort or staff (they were friendly and eager to help) and were able to sit back and relax for the entire week.

<Content>1 week in Paradise. I recently stayed at the Iberostar Bavaros for a week and it was great experience. Besides the amazing beaches the service and the food in the hotel were espectacular. The buffet had a varied selection everyday and the quality of the food was excellent. The rooms were clean and they keep the resort immaculate. I definitely will recommend this resort to anyone who is going to Punta Cana.Karla Zuniga

<Content>A very good all-inclusive resort My wife, 18-year old daughter, and I just returned from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro. Our experience was very good. The grounds and the beach are beautiful and VERY clean. The staff was excellent, everyone was friendly and helpful. The food was good, but not great. I would put it a notch below good cruise ship cuisine. But you can still eat well there. We found the Steakhouse and the Japanese restaurants to be quite decent. The regular buffet has a wide range of choices. We especially liked Dominican night when they served grilled giant prawns.Here's what we found to be the pro's and con's:Pro's - Beautiful and clean grounds, nice rooms, great staff, lots of available activities, good (but not great) food.Con's - Mattress was terrible (but a few after-dinner drinks solved that problem), the exercise facility is an open-air building; try working out at 90F and high humidity, the free catamarans were in rough shape so we ended purchasing the optional damage insurance for $15 since we didn't want to get hit with their inflated damage costs if something broke. One final note. Some previous reviewers on TripAdvisor reported having intestinal problems. We didn't hear anything about illness during our stay. You can drink the water served at meals and the icecubes in drinks are also OK, but do NOT drink the tap water in the rooms. We just brushed our teeth using bottled water from the mini-fridge, which was refilled every day.

<Content>Not a single problem! We stayed here for a long weekend, end of July, beginning of August. We are getting married here in October and wanted to check it out in person. Everything was better then what we expected. We are now on our 3rd wedding planner there! Yokatty had a baby and left, Attala was there for about 3 - 4 weeks and now we have Miguel. He seems a little inexperienced, but the resort is so nice, I can't imagine too big of a disaster.The food in the specialty restaurants was as good or better then chain restaurants. We loved the Mediterranean and Japanese restaurants. Didn't like the lobster salad at the Gourmet restaurant that everyone raved about. The Caribbean lobster tastes funny to us. My sirloin steak at the steakhouse was tough and tasteless. My finace's Steak Plate (that's what it's called on the menu) was flavorful and tender. We got to eat at more specialty restaurants then normal to test them for our wedding dinner. We are going with the Mediterranean. Nice intimate ambience and good food.We thought the resort was very clean. There is as much or as little to do as you would like. The people were all so friendly, even the gardners said hello. We've stayed at numerous all inclusives in Jamaica, Punta Cana and Cancun and this one was up there in value for your dollar. It's not a 5 star, but it's definitely not a 3 either. We could not find a thermostat in the room, but the temperature was fine. No problem with water temperature either. We drank the restaurant water with no ill affects. Slight musty smell in the room but no different then most seaside resorts. I was eaten alive by mosquitos, but that happens to me wherever I am. There are only 2 small drawers and about 5 shelves in the closet, so not much room for unpacking. They do have clock radios in the room, but they are on an outlet with a motion detector or something because 20 minutes after you open the room's door, the clock is flashing 12:00. We only set it at night and put up with the flashing during the day.The hair dryer in the bathroom was useless for me. Nice magnifying make up mirror, but lighting is pretty dim in the rooms. We thought the coffee in the rooms was much better then the coffee in the restaurants.

<Content>Don't Let Little Things Spoil Your Vacation We were a group of 6 that were all adults with 2 - 18 year old girls. Reading through earlier reviews, some scared us to death regarding getting sick. Others concerning opinions about the resort we decided to go with the majority and assume that it was overall good. Unfortunately one of the 18-year-old girls in our party broke her foot a few days before our trip. Our travel agent supposedly called ahead to request a wheel chair, rooms close to each others and close to the beach/pool. Our flight was delayed 4 hours so we actually didn't arrive until 9:30PM. Our assigned rooms were near the construction, furthest from everything. You cannot do anything over the phone at this resort, we had to walk back to the front desk and ask for a room that would suit our needs. That was not possible that night but they made it happen the next day by noon. Inconvenient, absolutely but like others said the resort will always try to accommodate your needs. The rooms were nice, our new one was in a perfect location that allowed us to get to the dining, pool, and beach and lobby easily. 4-5 star rooms in the US, no, but again very clean, no smell in either of ours and the housekeeping staff did all they could with any request you had. The food: we ate at buffets in the morning and for lunch. We made a reservation for dinner every night at one of the restaurants. The breakfast buffet had to have between 75-100 different items that included 16 hot dishes across 2 stations, 10 different fruits (the mangos were the best I ever had, must have ate 2 cases), cereals, yogurt, home made donuts and churros that were hot out of the oil, a bit greasy as expect but delicious, 10 different pastries and so on. Also include fresh juices daily.Lunch was pretty much the same every day but they always had a special station daily. One day was lobster paella that is the best I ever had, another day, grilled veggies, etc.Dinners were at the restaurants and our favorites were cajun, japan and gourmet. The lobster appetizer at gourmet was the best. One complaint about the reservations was that we always had to do 6:30 or 9:30 because everything else was booked by people who didn鈥檛 show up because there were many empty tables. We were lucky enough to have no real stomach issues until one person had some problems on the last day. I think it comes with the territory but take the precautions that others already wrote about.The pool is nice, beach is just beyond words. If this doesn't make you happy, stay home because nothing will. The staff is just unbelievable form the waiters, Jorge, to the entertainment team. These guys are everywhere all day and night and always with a smile. They have to be tired but they never show it. Always up beat and you can interact as much or as little as you want. They go out of their way to remember your name. I know this is all-inclusive and it says tips included but leave tips, as much as you can for good service. It is the right thing to do and it really is appreciated.Overall, we had a blast. There were little things here and there that we could complain about but get over it and enjoy the people, the resort and your friends and family.

<Content>medicwizz@yahoo.com First I want everyone to know that this resort is so great , that I have visited it 3 times in the past 2 years. The rooms are jr. suites and are very spacious and kept extremely clean(every day) The housekeeping staff are so nice and fill your mini bar with what YOU want everyday or upon request. the beverage refridgerators are not so cold, but we put ice in the sink and that was fine. I took Avon perfume sample bottles for gifts this last visit for the girls who cleaned our rooms and they were so excited and appreciative. This made us happy because these people are so poor and such hard workers. they are all so nice and pleasent to be around. the food here was very good except the steakhouse, the meat was very tough and not cooked properly.We loved spending time at the lobby bar. The battenders were so much fun!! We had a blast. I would recomend this resort to anyone except familys with small children , as the beach is topless. Depending on how much your ok with your children seeing,and trust me, you will see some sights that you'll never forget. TRUST ME!!! HA HA there is always entertainment in the pool area and at the lobby bar area. The RIU has a very nice club, or disco as they call it only a 2.oo taxi ride away. My youngest daughter who is 19 y/o wants to go there after WE graduate from college and I cant wait to take her there!! I have nothing bad to say about this resort except the ac is not to cool but you can handle it and no american beer. But El Presidente is pretty good. Do not go here in the summer months , as the heat and humidity is out of control and almost unbearable. I found that My November trip was the perfect weather it was totally Beautiful. No problem getting in the specialty resturants. all and all this was the best vacation site I have ever went on and I will return a fourth and fifth and sixth time. HAPPY VACATIONING!!

<Content>What an amazing location...just watch for minor damp! Having been to the north of the Dominican Republic last year (2007) we decided to go back but to the East Coast this year. We loved the Iberostar last year and decided that as they seemed to be among the best on the island we would go to the Iberostar Bavaro. We were not disappointed. However there were one or two negatives along the way.FLIGHTS AND TRANSFERThe flight to the holiday was great with what seemed like a lot of legroom. We flew with Thomas Cook and they recently increased the legroom. The inseat TVs were great and provided plenty of entertainment for my wife and I and our 15 year old daughter.Transfer to the hotel was over in 30 mins and then it was time to check in and see our junior suite for the first time!CHECK IN and ROOMThe check in proceedure was simple and straight forward and all had been organised in advance of us arriving. Great news said the man behind the counter - as both families are travelling together we have put you beside each other!. Great but we had no idea who the other people were. Even better they had a 14 year old and the two kids never looked back. Neither did we as the two sets of parents set about drinking the bar dry each night and not remembering much about the walk back to the apartments.We were originally given a room towards the middle of the complex and towards the new luxury hotel that is being built (no noise so ignore other comments about building work). Seemed great but there was a musty smell which wasnt right. My wife was really quite concerned and we opened the cupboard to find a puddle in the bottom I became concerned. The source of the smell came from the bathroom as there was quite a lot of damp on the walls. Clearly visible and undoubtedly causing a smell. I spoke to reception and we got moved the following day to a new room down towards the beach - it was great and the help in moving was superb.The rooms themselves are great. A bit more space but the daughter found sleeping on the settee a bit uncomfortable. I can understand why it was like a brick! But the sun and the sand made it a bit easier.STAFFWhat can I say they are all great. The Star Friends work their socks off and seem to be there 24 hours a day. If you want to play games all day and win a Star Friends Winner T-Shirt then there will be plenty to keep you happy.FOODBrilliant. I think that sums it up.Breakfast was great either up at the main restaurant or down at the beach restaurant.Lunch was the same but the hotdogs from the beach bar were to die for! Salads a plenty though, and if you like Smoked Salmon you will love this place.Dinner - We only ate in the main buffet restaurant a couple of times and spent the rest of the time in the a la carte restaurants. They say you can only book three a week, but there are always cancellations.The gourmet restaurant -La Coupole - was tremendous and as everyone seems to say have the lobster starter as it is amazing. The steak is also melt in the mouth. If anything there is too much to eat, but great surroundings.Of the other restaurants we loved the Japanese and the steak house but were not so keen on the Cajun. Everyone's taste is different but to be fair you won't be disappointed. We went to the sister hotel one evening for dinner at the Mexican. It was brilliant but no where near enough and we ended up having a starter to start with and again to finish.FLIGHT HOMEAwful!! Absolutely terrible. It seemed to have less space, the seats were like bricks, there was no multi channel TV etc. It was trully awful.OVERALLThis was a fantastic holiday with great friends that we met while there. The beach at this resort is amazing. Pure white sands, crystal clear water. Perfect.I would recommend this hotel to anyone.One final word of warning though - make sure you lock all your belongings away in the safe. Our friends had an iPod stolen and we heard about other things going missing. But we were fine.Enjoy

<Content>Great Beach Beach is better than any place I have stayed in Mexico (three resorts). Plenty of huts for shade (get there by 7:15 am for front row), plenty of good quality chairs, little coral, good snorkeling. Third time staying at the Iberostar Baravo, fifth time to the area (other resorts - Sunsscape [do not recommend - overpriced for what you get and poor service] and Princess [average]). The food was good - recommend the Gourmet Restaurant (steak; adults only) and Cajun (Grouper). The buffet usually had something to satisfy everyone (two teenagers and two adults), very good bread, cheese and fruit. The buffet needs to be glassed in and air-conditioned 鈥?most nights are too warm to eat in non-air conditioned restaurants (other restaurants which require reservations are air conditioned). The rooms are nice, the updated bathrooms are small but nice. The room was a little warm (left you really wanting to eat dinner in air conditioning) and the refrigerator was very warm (take a cooler if you like cold drinks, ice machines close to rooms). The beds were adequate if you like firm. Can't comment on the pool - did not use.Our vacation was booked with VIP travel 鈥?do not book fishing trips through AquaBlue fishing 鈥?very poor equipment and boat (not what the pictures indicate). After fighting a 10-foot Marlin for 2 hours the line broke and so did the boat. They sent a 20-foot Johnboat out several miles to bring the customers back. The Johnboat did not have life preservers. On other trips to Punta Cana we went swimming with Sting Rays and Nerd Sharks (recommend) and the trip to some island and to swim with star fish (spend half the day in a bus and two hours on boats to spend two hours at the island 鈥?do not recommend).Overall, you can鈥檛 beat the beach in the Punta Cana area or the Iberostar Bavaro 鈥?you get what you pay for and Iberostar Bavaro is worth the extra coin.

<Content>5 years in a row---still the best place to go We have been going to Iberostar Bavaro for the last 5 years. We tried another resort in 1/2008 and were disappointed. 1/2009 we are heading back to Iberostar Bavaro where we know we will enjoy ourselves.When we check in we are welcomed with a cocktail and a freindly face.The rooms are spotless and cleaned and restocked everyday.The food is plentiful and good. We have never fallen ill due to the food either the buffet or specialty restaurants.The pool area is always clean and service is friendly with the staff greeting you all day as they pass.It is the best beach I have seen and this sentiment is echoed by most of the people we talk to.The one thing that really tickled us was the fact that many of the staff remembered us by name from all our previous visits. Makes you feel special.We highly recommend this resort for a relaxing holiday.

<Content>The best beaches and people We traveled to Iberostar Bavaro on 7/15-7/22 and enjoyed every minute. We did not encounter any issues with checking in, our room or air conditioning. The people are so nice and we had a great family vacation. You've got to get involved with the Star Friends b/c they make your stay so much more fun. They are great with the kids but really work hard to get the parents involved as well. A big shout out to Wilson, Spaghetti, Henry and James Bond. Also, the kid's shows lead by Bell are great. I felt very comfortable allowing my 9 year old to go with Bell to the kids disco and they were always escorted back on time to the main stage. While tipping is not required, I will tell you that it is greatly appreciated and very easy to part with money due to the fabulous staff. I recommend any family that wants beach time, interaction with the star friends and just a fabulous setting to go to Iberostar Bavaro.

<Content>Great Time We stayed from July 24-July 28. Arriving at Iberostar Bavaro:Arrival at the resort was awesome. Our luggage was unloaded by the resort staff for us when we arrived. Check-in went quickly as we were served a cool tropical drink. The front desk staff was very friendly. We were staying there with two other couples and we had requested rooms close together. As soon as check in was completed, they took our luggage and us by golf cart to our room. They had accommodated us to the newly renovated rooms between the beach and the pool. Beautiful location. The room was great and nicely decorated. Looks just like the pictures you have seen on-line. No musty smell anytime . The A\C worked great. There was a safe in the room that was complimentary.This resort is kept in immaculate condition. The employees are always cleaning and picking up throughout the day and evening. I was surprised how friendly and helpful everyone was during our stay. Everyone there was just great and always greeted us with a smile. The Peacocks and water fowl have the run of the property. They are very beautiful and will offer many photo opportunities.The beach was just beautiful. The beach bar was a nice addition. Plenty of loungers and don't have to worry about reserving early.The food was just average. Can't say enough about the breakfast buffet. They had everything and more and very good. The lunch and dinner buffets are like any other buffet but just average. We went to the Steakhouse Restaurant which was OK. We tried the Cajun Restaurant which was better than the Steakhouse. The worst is the Star Rock Cafe located over at the Dominicana. Do NOT go there. It took them 1 hour to bring our appetizers which consisted of a bowl of soup and another 1 hour for our meal. Several patrons were getting up and leaving. We were getting ready to and the waitress bagged us to stay for 5 more minutes. We did and the meat entree was good, however, the vegetables were cold. We didn't even stay for the dessert. Probably would have taken about hour. We were told there machine broke and that created the problem. The casino on the premise is small but was fun. One of the couples won $300 one night and $500 another night. Unfortunately I didn't win but had fun.The staff was very friendly. The drinks were plentiful. Do not be afraid to ask for extra alcohol. They will be more than happy to add more to your drink. The bartenders at the swim up bar were always singing and dancing. Wish I enjoyed my job as much as they seemed to enjoy theirs. However, my husband wasn't pleased with the beer selection. They only had Presidente on tap at the pool bar. The Mexican beer is better than the DR beer. Other than that, we still had a great time there.I've read a lot of reviews where people got sick. Luckily, none of the six of us got sick. We've been to Mexico several times and have come back sick and there is a prescription for that parasite. We had called our doctor and asked for that prescription to take with us in case we got sick but didn't need it. Before you leave, call your doctor and tell him you are going to a foreign country and to call you in a prescription to kill the parasite in case you get it.Overall, it is a beautiful resort and I would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Dont believe everything you read!! Wow, Wow, Wow!My family and I have been yo many all inclusive resorts, in the past our goal was to try a different Country each time we travel.I will start this off by saying that I would go back to the Iberostar Bavaro in Punt Cana in a heart beat! I read and read the reviews here on trip advisor, reading through the lines we decided that you cannot make everyone happy 100% of the time. Lets start with some of the more common complaints. This is not a 5 star Hotel, if your comparing to a USA $500 a night room you will be disappointed. Remember you are in a third world Country not the USA. The room was great, how much time do you spend in a room when you are on the beach? I am 6'4 300lbs and if I did have a complaint it would have been the room we had with 2 beds the bed was small, a double maybe? I have one child and when we go again I will book a king room with fold out couch bed for my child. Musty smell, yes there was a every so slight musty smell. We took scented candles and never lit one. Nothing to be concerned about! The air conditioning, no thermo but I would sayit stayed a nice pleaseant 72-72 degrees the whole trip, no worries. The food, Wow we made resos at several of the special resturants and never made it. These resturants you must set a time for dinner and wear long pants (no denium). We found the Buffet at all meals to be amazing! If you are picky I promise you will have no problems with the food, everything you can imagine for breakfast and lunch, dinner was from steak to lobster, fish and more fish, fresh sliced turkey, pork, beef. Pizza and hamburgers with fries at every luch and dinner for the kids.I ate sushi and all the above without one bit of stomach concern. The reviews about the bad food? They were not staying at the same resort as we were!! The food was A+. The beverages, if you are looking for top shelf booze you are more or less out of luck. The blender drinks are mostly with rum, the rum is made there in the Dominican, it was good. The beer Presidente on draught was actually quite good. At night the bar next to the stage has your better call labels. This bar is open all day but away from the beach and pool, no complaints. The pool was not the biggest I have ever been in but more than adequate. We spent most of our time on the beach but the pool was great never felt crowded.The beach was awesome, Aruba was the only other Island that I could compare the sand to, powdered sugar fine and white white.The water was cool enough to feel refreshed after being in the sun ( pool also ) Both were crystal clear. The palm leaf covered cabanas were wonderful, I stayed in the shade and my girls were right next to me in the sun. The weather was about 85-90 degrees each day, humid. Topless sun bathing is here and thereso be ready or explain to your children ahead of time. About 200 yards from the Hotel is a small gathering of make shift buildings where the locals sell there hand made items along with cigars, paintings, jewelery and so on. No prices are marked, If the price stars at $40 say NO THANK YOU and start to walk away the prices will drop in half to $20 and if you are in the mood you can barter to $7-10 dollars. We bought allot of stuff for $100 US.The tours, we did not do any! This was our first trip to do nothing.The Hotel will let you sail ( Hobby Cat ) for one hour free each day or snorkeling gear was also free one hour per day. Most days there was bingo, dance lessons or something going on.The shows were not Broadway for sure but the costumes werefirst class, they we Ok and I will leave it at that. Now lets get to the working staff at the Hotel, first class! Never saw anyone without a great attitude or a big smile A+. These people work 12 days on 12 + hours per day and then 3 days off. They make a whopping $5-7 US. per day!! We took down allot of stuff for the locals to give away. Cash works best, Take a few hundred dollars in $1 billsand hand them out. These people are among the hardest working I have ever seen, they do their very best to make you vacation wonderful. The Hotel has a Disco that is OK, opens at 11PM. Right next door for you cigar lovers is a great shop, the man that owns the shop hand rolls cigars out front almost every night for $5 each. The store has a great selection with REAL Cubans at a fair price. DONT buy your cigars from the beach vendors as they are all fake. I have said enough to give you some idea that we thought this Hotel was a good bargin for the $$. We spoke to other people on the beach that were paying double what our Hotel charged and they were not getting anything more, maybe the same or less? If you have any questions dont hesitate to write me @ nugman.net Big Joe

<Content>hotel california sucks The big problem occurred at checkout when I could not remember my room number and did not have my towel card. They couldn't find my room # even though I handed them my card (key).After much profanity, I just walked away and told them to bill my account. I then attempted to board the bus to the airport and was denied entry. I was told I could not leave the premises without completing checkout. These people put the banana in the word republic. Out of desperation I found my room number and paid the 30 bucks I owed. The half literate security force then permitted me to board. If you go make sure you remember your room # and have your towel card. Other than this the hotel was pretty good. My overall impression was that it cloned the club med formula but was not nearly as friendly. There is a mixed group of guests from Germany, Russia, France and other parts of Europe. Maybe Americans constitute 20% of the guests??? People keep to themselves. There are alot of families who just want to spend time by themselves. My room was execeptional (2381). It was a junior suite consisting of separate living room and bedroom area. The living room area is sunken two steps below the bedroom area. It contains an L shaped couch and large flat screen. The flat screen can be viewed from either bedroom area or living room area. The furniture in my room was actually solid mahogany, which was very suprising. The air conditioning unit was exceptional. It didnt blow directly onto the bed and it kept the humiidity within the room extremely low. Food was average. You cant go wrong with freshly sliced fruits and cheeses. Even though I'm not a heavy drinker, it was obvious to me that the bar service was excellent. The bartenders are very quick, friendly and make excellent drinks. On the downside, a drunk from Boston became very rude. People complained but the bar refused to cut him off. Eventually he passed out but that took a few hours. The beach is excellent but not world class. It is comparable to Miami Beach. I would definitely not return due to my treatment at checkout. Personally I found their tactics shameful and despicable. The Dominicans are extremely lackadaisical about many things but they are fanatical about security. If you go bring lots of small bills because no one seems to have change, if you know what I mean. When you step onto these all inclusives in the dr you're living on the Hacienda. Sometimes you can check in but you can't check out. Finally, do not fly out of airport on a Sunday. I arrived at 12 noon and did not get to the gate until 2 pm. Youre standing outside beneath a thatched roof on a hot day. Some elderly travelers were very upset by this. Final impression: good bang for the buck but you're better off upgrading to a better hotel, or better yet, avoid the country entirely.

<Content>watch what you eat!! Try to use cash!!! My husband and i spent our 10 year anniversary. When we arrived the hotel staff was not that friendly. We were not offered a drink, as other guests where. Upon arrival to the room, we thought the room was very nice. The grounds were also beautiful except for the stagnant pond neer the dining room. The second day of our trip, my husband became ill with tourista. I had to cancel reservations to the restaurants. I was told i had to come to the reservation desk to reschedule, they needed a receipt. The third day of our trip, i became ill. Overall the experience was not great. The food was bad. The service ok. Beach was beautiful. When we returned home we were called from our credit card company that there had been fraud like spending on two credit cards. The hotel was where we used these cards. Apparently there is some way you can copy a card, because we did not loose them.

<Content>Impressive I was there with my family in december 2004, we were 5 people. I had been in Punta Cana before, in a Paradisus Hotel, and we wanted to try a different hotel. The hotel is so clean, the staff very warm, and the food impressive!!! The hotel is one of the best I've been in Punta Cana, and I will be back probably next year. In fact, my niece will be there next september for her honeymoon. As a summary, is a tropical hotel with european style (quality and service)

<Content>What can I say, it was FANTASTIC We just got back from Iberostar Bavaro, I was with my husband 3 eighteen year old girls, my 23 year old son and his girlfriend.We all had a great time, the hotel is spotless, the landscaping breathtaking, the beach was beautiful clean warm water, swaying palm trees. We never had a problem getting chairs with shade at the beach, you did have to get up by 8 to get a shade unbrella at the pool. Food was great, we all had a touch of upset stomach, but that is natural when eating in a different country.. HINT: squeeze lime on your food, a native told us it settles your stomach when eating food cooked different than you are use too.Staff at hotel very friendly, my ONLY complaint is the Guest Services Desk, not friendly not helpful. Rooms were spotless and very very nice and roomy, we had a beach view, I recomend you ask for one in the 2300 very nice and close to pool and beach... the men complained when you had to wear long pants at night for certain restaurants, it was VERY hot. Drinks were good and plentiful. the girls had a blast at the lobby bar, and the disco, the night time shows were good, some better than others... we did not do any off resort tours it was just toooo hot!! they did do parasailing and banana boats and had fun.I truly recomend this resort and I plan on returning soon hopefully..

<Content>GREAT VACATION @ Iberostar Bavaro!! My wife and I stayed at the IBB for our honeymoon from July 14-21. Let me say, from start to finish, this was an AMAZING vacation at a GREAT resort, with FRIENDLY staff.Arrival / Room: We arrived at the resort at 11:00am on Monday July 14. Our room wasn't ready yet (expected) and we were told to come back at 1pm and our room would be ready. What do ya know, we returned to check-in at 1pm and we were given our room keys. We walked over to our room (2387) and our bags were delivered about 10 minutes later. The room was very nice, A/C was on and working all week. Mini bar was always filled with enough beer and bottled water. Nice balcony, Flat screen TV, safe that worked, and the room was right next to the main pool area (just as we requested).Pool: The pool was nice, but it did need a bit of paint touch up, but nothing major that would cause any complaints from us. The pool bar was nice and drinks were always flowing. I really like the buffet at the pool as it was easy to climb out of the pool and grab lunch without having to walk to the front of the resort to eat at the main buffet. We had no problems finding chairs in the shade, plenty to go aroundBeach: ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! The sand was powder white and the water was blue as could be. Again, plenty of shaded huts on the beach and plenty of chairs in the sun. There is also a beach bar that has cold drinks and snacks. We walked the beach in each direction all the days we were there. You really see some interesting people!Food / Buffets / Restaurants: We ate at all the buffets and also the Steak House, Tropical, and Jap. restaurants. We liked them all, but if you are really starved, I would suggest eating at the buffets as the portions at the ala carte's were fairly small in my opinion. We drank tons of water at the buffets and restaurants and never got sick!!Entertainment / Shows: The lobby bars had some really good shows over the week. Seemed they really put a lot of effort into them. We had access to all three resorts (PC, Dominicana, Bavaro) so we watched shows at all three lobby bars. I like to play cards, so the Casino was one place we went each night. They have blackjack, three cards poker, Carribean stud, slots, etc.Checkout / Departure: We were picked up at the resort at 7:30am on July 21 and arrived at the airport at 8:30am (a bit early for our 11am departure) as it took less than 10 minutes to get our boarding passes and go through security.I would rate our trip an 8.7 overall and would recommend this resort to everyone. The staff was amazing and soooo friendly. They always had a smile on their face and would remember you from day to day! We ate, drank, relaxed and truly enjoyed our stay!!

<Content>Still have stomach problems!! I stayed at the Iberostar from July 11-18 and went with a group of 40 for a wedding. The wedding was beautiful - the staff was very attentive and the florist and photographer were great. The pool was lots of fun and the we had no problems getting drinks at the pool bar. On the downside, there was not alot of variety when it came to the food. The breakfast food was so oily I just ate fruit after the first 2 days. The buffets offered the same things each night and the restaurants were just OK compared to some other all-inclusive resorts I have stayed at. Many of us got sick from the food and either just ate bread or had no choice but to deal with diarrhea the whole time. 3 days back from our trip and most of us are still having stomach problems.Comparing this hotel to other chains I have stayed at, I would definitely never stay at an Iberostar again - nor would I recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Healthy Advice My wife and I just returned from a 6 night stay at the Iberostar Bavaro (June 25-July 1). Like most of you, I had researched our trip, checked message boards, read traveler reviews and felt well prepared and armed with everything I needed to know. But the confidence I had when we left Alabama was shattered when my wife was rushed by ambulance from the IB to the hospital.Now don鈥檛 get me wrong鈥 am not bashing the DR or the IB. The resort was beautiful, the staff was friendly, the beach was the prettiest I have ever seen, the food was adequate, the drinks were plentiful and we always felt safe. But I never really factored in one thing I read over and over again and this one thing would play a key role in our overall experience. You鈥檝e read it also and I suspect you have failed to realize its implications. That fact is simply this; the DR is a very poor country. In retrospect perhaps that is why we chose the DR for our vacations. The price of the all inclusive resort in the DR compared to other tropical locations is a real value鈥nless something goes wrong. We were having a great time when my wife started feeling nauseated 2 days into our trip. Within 4 hours of feeling nauseated she was throwing up uncontrollably. We went to the medical facility at the IB but her condition required IV fluids and lab tests to determine what was causing her problems. She was rushed by ambulance to the hospital and was admitted for 27 hours. The diagnosis was a gastric bacterial infection requiring antibiotics and dehydration requiring IV fluids. We鈥檒l never know how the bacteria got into her system. I am sure everyone probably has an opinion as to what caused the bacterial infection but lets omit the obvious choices. We didn鈥檛 drinking un-bottled water; we didn鈥檛 eat any food that was not prepared by the resort; we didn鈥檛 brush our teeth with tap water; and on and on. The doctor at the hospital told us the DR is a tropical island, and because it never gets cold, bacteria is abundant. He also told us 90% of the people in the hospital are tourists on vacation who are diagnosed with gastric or respiratory bacterial infections.Do you have traveler鈥檚 health insurance? The DR didn鈥檛 have a contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield so I paid $1,700.00 US for the one day in the hospital. The hospital was poorly equipped and poorly staffed. The room had spider webs throughout the ceiling and the wheeled IV stand would not roll because the wheels were corroded. My wife was admitted to a room at 11:00PM and no one came into the room to check on her until 10:00AM the next morning. Her IV had quit during the night and the antibiotics did not flow until they readjusted the drip the next morning. The hospital had 3 floors and we were in room 306. At 3:00AM I went to find a doctor or nurse to check on my wife and only found one nurse on the first floor fast asleep on her desk. When I inquired about someone checking on my wife the nurse didn鈥檛 speak English. When the doctor finally arrived in the room in the morning he informed my wife she needed to stay an additional night. The level of 鈥渃are鈥?was so bad my wife asked for medication that could be taken orally and we were discharged several hours later. The hospital tried to charge me $121 for staying in the room with my wife (I sat in a wooden chair all night). I refused to pay for that charge. I am hopeful BCBS will reimburse me for using an out-of-network emergency hospital admission but traveler鈥檚 insurance might be worth taking a look at if you are going to the DR. Here is the best advice I have to share. Many of you have read 鈥渉ome鈥?remedies for traveler鈥檚 diarrhea that include taking Imodium or similar products prior to your trip to prevent or stop diarrhea. My wife did not use this remedy but if she had she would have been even sicker than she was. When people get traveler鈥檚 diarrhea it is because their bodies are trying to rid itself of something that needs to get out. If you 鈥渃ork鈥?things up, whatever that is bad builds up inside your body and you become sicker and sicker. Most of the tourists hospitalized had used Imodium or similar products and the results were devastating. I talked to people who were having their systems flushed (stomach pump irrigations) in an attempt to rid their bodies of bacteria so the antibiotics could work effectively. If you get diarrhea, let it flow. It might be inconvenient but it won鈥檛 ruin your trip like a hospital stay will.I doubt I will venture into another poverty stricken country for vacation. My wife and I learned a lot about the DR; saw some amazing sights; met some great people; but we also saw the down side of being in a country where health and medical care are at a low. If you are going to the DR everything will probably be okay. Just be ware!

<Content>Don't drink the restaurant water! My husband and I took our 3 kids to the Iberostar Bavaro from June 5 - June 12, 2008. We had done a lot of research and were excited with our choice. After our trip, we wish we would have gone somewhere else. Let me say that we're really not that picky. Maybe we just had some bad luck, but here is what happened to us. You can take it or leave it.The hotel itself is pretty nice. We had gone to the Majestic last year and preferred the pool, bars, rooms, etc... there over the Iberostar. Nothing is terrible... It's just not great. We had 2 adjoining rooms which was great since we were travelling with the kids. The bathrooms, however, smelled horribly of sewage the entire time we were there. It was so bad in our kids' room that they ended up using our bathroom the whole week. The lock on our safe got stuck and we had to call maint. to come fix it. We also had a problem with the sliding glass door in our kids' room. The lock got stuck and it wouldn't open. This happened twice during our stay even though maint. had said it was fixed.The pool was okay. It was a nice size and had a deep end which was a nice extra. It did look like it needed a little painting but overall was pretty nice. The swim up bar was a waste of time. There was rarely a bartender available there. They always had to go up to the upper area of the bar to make your drink. We figured this out and just started getting out of the water to get served a little faster. The water in the swim up bar area also always seemed to have a lot of bugs and leaves floating on top. It was almost like the skimmer wasn't working properly.The worst part of our vacation actually happened after our stay. We ate at the buffet and the specialty restaurants as well. My husband was the only one of the five of us that drank the purified water in the reservation only restaurants. We only drank bottled water in the room. We brushed our teeth with bottled water also. Anyway, the day before we left, he started getting sick. He had diarrhea for over 10 days after we got home and was so weak he couldn't go to work. After lots of tests, including colonoscopy and stool samples, it was determined that he had gotten a parasite called giardiasis while on vacation (presumably from the water). He lost 14 pounds in 10 days, his potassium and calcium levels dropped so low that he was hospitalized for 4 days. They had to have him on an IV and a heart monitor because they were afraid he'd go into cardiac arrest to the low levels. He's now been on flagyl for almost 2 weeks and is trying to help his body recover. He even had to talk to the Dept. of Health in our town because the parasite is VERY contagious. Whatever you do... DON'T drink the water!!! Don't believe them when they say it's filtered or purified. Good things about our stay... The beach is gorgeous (as are most in Punta Cana). Our kids had a great time playing on the beach. The best thing about our stay was definitely the staff. The entertainment staff are amazing. I cannot say enough about them. JP was our buddy. Our three year old daughter, named Baby White by JP, called him her boyfriend by the third day. James Bond and Henry were great as well. They definitely made our trip! Everyone was great with the kids. The shows were actually pretty good too! The kids also LOVED the ice cream. Overall, we could deal with the things that weren't great while we were there (the room, etc...). We had a good time until my husband got sick. It's been a month and he's still recovering. Please be careful if you choose to visit the Iberostar Bavaro. If we had to do it all again, we'd go back to the Majestic instead of the Iberostar (but we'd try to convince JP and the others to join us : )

<Content>I had a great wedding and a wonderful vacation! I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro for a vacation/wedding/honeymoon with a group of about 15 family and friends. I had a really great time. Here are some specifics:Arrival / Check-in: We found our bus to the resort easily and were soon on our way. Check-in was a breeze and took less than 5 minutes. Room: For the first night we stayed in a room closer to the lobby. We had asked for a room closer to the beach at check-in and they were able to accomodate us on the second day. We got a call first thing in the morning and within 15 minutes our bags and ourselves were relocated to the beach front room. I have no complaints regarding temperature, size, or smell. At home we have a queen so the king size bed was a dream. The AC controls were a little counterintuitive - 1 is actually the highest setting (the dial says 1, 2, 3). We kept it on 1 the whole time and it functioned well. Bathroom: It was nice - with a huge shower and great water pressure. The toilet area was a bit cramped but it accomodated my fat ass. My only complaint was that there was no exhaust fan, but even so the ventilation didn't let nasty smells linger forever. Wedding: My biggest complaint for this vacation was having to deal with the resort's wedding coordinator. Upon our arrival, I was sickened to learn that the resort had no record of our wedding booking - despite the fact that we had confirmed on multiple occasions. This was soon cleared up after a meeting with the wedding coordinator Atalla. However, after this incident I received a phone call in my room saying that they would not be able to have the wedding on our desired date because the florist could not provide flowers. This was entirely unacceptable. I'm fortunate to be able to speak Spanish well enough to demand to see the hotel manager. After a brief chat with her the flower dilemma was also resolved. The manager stated that the coordinator should have never called me to tell me this - the fact that they were having issues with the florist was THEIR problem, and not mine. In the end, we had beautiful flowers for the ceremony and reception. If you book a wedding here, please, please make sure to confirm and re-confirm, and then re-confirm one more time and get something in writing. Beach: It was absolutely gorgeous and not overly crowded. We opted to drag chairs closer to the water and thoroughly enjoyed being served drink after drink while baking away in the sun. The water was incredible and there is some decent snorkeling right there in front of the hotel. Restaurants: All the food was good - nothing was spectacular but everything was good. Its better than what I expected for a third world country. Its very easy to overeat! They had really tasty steaks too! Myself and my husband became ill after eating at the seafood restaurant, but thankfully the illness didn't commence until the day we left.Alcohol: Ask for doubles! They will accomodate. I had tons of tasty drinks and have no complaints. Ask for the beer with ice, if not it will be lukewarm when served and hot within a few minutes. Ask for an extra cup of ice to keep cold drinks cold. Herb: Ask a bartender wink winkPool: I liked it. I spent half of my day hanging half out of the pool drinking my drinks. They kick you out when the steakhouse opens, but you can go back in the pool when it closes at about 1130pm. I had a few great night swims.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro Good Time Overall We stayed a little over two weeks and we had a great time overall. The staff were very friendly and the food was great. I'd recommend the buffet as there is enough variety and quantity to satisfy everyone's appetite. The other restaurants that were not great and in fact, the Steak restaurant by the pool bordered on terrible. We canceled reservations we had made for other restaurants on site because the buffet was so far superior. Bar service was very good although they have only one brand of beer and only one white and one red wine. Room was very nice but cigar smoke from adjacent room caused us to switch rooms which wasn't a problem...again the folks there are great. My biggest complaint by far is that If you're a non smoker, you simply can not get away from smokers...they do have non smoking sections in the restaurants (ineffective). Smokers use the beach sand as an ashtray (even though ashtrays are provided) so one gets cigarette butts between the toes, etc. People smoke in the pool...simply no escape from it. If they'd disallow smoking in the rooms, restaurants and pool area, it would be a superior place.One last caveat, some of the folks selling trips in the lobby are less than scrupulous....Aqua Blue fishing is to be avoided at all costs as they don't provide enough life jackets and boat is very old...no radio, fish finder, GPS or seat on the toilet...gross!

<Content>Loved this experience! Reading the reviews written by those who had been to this hotel before us was very helpful. The best tip we received was to bring single dollar bills for tipping. There were six of us in our party and we went through at least $200 singles in a week. Tipping is very much appreciated by everyone who works at the hotel, from waitpeople to maids, and they'll remember you for it!One thing I did want to clarify is that the only laundry facilities on the property is that which the hotel operates. Someone had written that there was a laundromat on the grounds and suggested bringing your own laundry soap, which we did. However, there are no do-it-yourself facilities, so we paid (not very much at all) to have some clothes cleaned. Not sure why they wrote about that for this hotel, but it wasn't accurate.This resort was great for us. There were 3 adults and 3 teenagers, and there was plenty (or nothing) to do for everyone! There are activities every 30 minutes if you want to participate, or you can lay on the beach or at the pool and just relax. It was perfect.Our VIP Travel rep at the hotel recommended a half-day trip to snorkel with sharks (not the biting kind!) and stingrays (harmless), and we loved it. We were picked up at the hotel and taken to a big double-deck pontoon boat that took us out to the various spots. We bought waterproof cameras to take with us, and that's all we needed. The equipment was provided, and it was a lot of fun.We also went horseback riding. Our rep recommended one of the two ranches available, and it was a 40 minute ride to the ranch from our hotel, as opposed to another that was closer. This one was a good choice as we rode along the beach and the guides were great. They took our cameras and took pictures (and video) of us while we rode, and they were very kind to those who were a little nervous. Only downside was the ride to the ranch. We went in a safari-type vehicle....bench seating and open with a cover over the seats. We had to breathe in the exhaust fumes there and back which was a little sickening, but the horseback riding part of it was terrific.The people at this resort could not have been nicer, and I still marvel at how many people it must take to run the operation they have there. I would definitely recommend it....great value, nice people, and beautiful scenery.

<Content>Punta Cana is Paradise This hotel was a wonderful all-inclusive. The staff was happy, helpful and cheerful. The language barrier was minimal. The grounds were beautiful. The rooms were nice with a sunken sitting room/bedroom. The air conditioner in the room worked real hard to try to keep up with the outside temperature and humidity. The bathroom had a separate tub and shower stall. My only complaint was that the bathroom didn't have a fan and therefore the bathroom was always hot and humid. Bring your own hairdryer. The one provided was not great for drying my hair. The food was pretty good. In addition to the buffet, we also went to the Mediterranean, the Steakhouse, and the French restaurant. The Steakhouse was good, but the other two were excellent choices. The buffet provided a good assortment of food, even kids could find something to eat. The breakfast buffet was delicious. Lunch was wonderful, too. They had a couple themes set up during the week, a cookout where they grilled ribeyes and the dominican day where then made paeau (spelling? rice and seafood in a spicy sauce) in giant skillets. In my opinion, this resort did not skimp on alcohol. The staff was always pushing drinks. If you declined, they would keep trying to suggest other things. The beach was absolutely beautiful. Clean water and the individual cabanas were nice and kept us from burning in the sun. The pool was nice. There was a nice swim up bar. Lots of activities, from beach volleyball, bingo, water aerobics, dancing lessons, water polo, etc. We went on an extra 2 hour scuba diving excursion. Very nice. I would definitely recommend this resort and will return again in the near future.

<Content>Good week at the Bavaro This was our 5th all-inclusive. We requested an upper floor room with king-size bed, close to the beach - we got our request, room 1317 right at the beach. The beach in Punta Cana is awesome...now for the details.Rooms-decent! The bed was a bit too hard and had a hump in the middle - as if it were two beds pushed together. Flat screen TV was good. We did have problems with our air conditioning - it never got cool, and I mean below about 80. When we first checked in I called the front desk to report the problem...someone came out within 20 minutes, but all he said was I fix it tomorrow. Well, tomorrow came and it never got fixed...we just dealt with it. In addition, the fridge wasn't very cold either. Room did have a clock/radio. Decor was a bit worn - it was time for a make-over.Maid/Service- We tipped a little bit the first coupledays, however, I didn't feel we got anything extra....I understand these people don't make much money...so a little bit can go a long way. We did ask for more beer and water which was replaced as requested. Pool/Pool Bar- It was nice...wasn't the best pool I've been to...but it served its purpose. The swim up bar was nice...didn't really use it as much as I thought we would (we are more beach people). Food - Buffett (breakfast and lunch)- quality of food was pretty good. Japanese, La Copula (Gourmet), Mexican, Mediterranean, and Steak House restaurants were all very good. It wasn't difficult after 3 pm to reserve additional restaurants--as a matter of fact, we were able to reserve a restaurant for each of our 5 nights. Gourmet and Japanese were the best! One last thing about the restaurants, being stuck in long-pants, I thought the restaurants were not very cool tempature wise.Beach- Beautiful...you could walk miles and miles and not be haggled....We did play the towel game - got up each morning around 8 am and went out to reserve a palapa, which wasn't a problem at that time of day. It gets pretty darn hot on the beach so I'd suggest reserving a palapa on one of the 1st two rows closest to the ocean. We saw more topless women in PC than any other resort area we've been too - not that there's anything wrong with that ;-)Overall- we liked this resort. The property alone was worth going to see. There were excursions you could do; however, we just relaxed... We would go back to Punta Cana but would probably stay in an adults only resort.PS...I want to say hi to the very nice Ohio couple's we met - lucky them, there rooms were cool!!

<Content>Perfection at the Bavaro My family and I just returned from a wonderful week at the Iberostar Bavaro. There were seven of us ranging in age from 15 to 83 - all enjoyed themselves. First, as others have indicated, the place is very beautiful. The grounds are immaculate and perfectly landscaped. The rooms are quite adequate (we had three) and kept suitably clean. The only suggestion which I would make on possibly improving the rooms would be to have fabrics and other soft goods better suited to the climate (e.g. plantation shutters instead of drapes and duvet covers which can be easily laundered instead of bed spreads). This would, in all likelihood eliminate any unpleasant odors. We saw absolutely no bugs anywhere. It should also be noted that we had no problems with the water. We drank the hotel's water at all meals and used the tap to brush our teeth. Based on the sheer number of our party it must be assumed that the resort does a good job of purifying the water for the guests and with using proper methods of ensuring the cleanliness of the food.The food was very good at the buffets. We tended to eat breakfast in the buffet by the lobby - where there were abundant choices: A variety of fresh fruit juices, omelets, freshly made donuts, wonderful breads, danish butter etc. Similarly the lunch was better at the lobby buffet - but in most instances my family members elected to eat by the pool as a matter of convenience. It was fine - but a bit warm and somewhat less an attractive option. The specialty restaurants were very good. The gourmet restaurant, in particular, was extraordinarily good. We were actually able to dine there several times and found all of the menu choices to be outstanding. Drinks were also very good. All the bars have top shelf stock. You simply have to specify your choice. We found the lobby bar to be the best in terms of atmosphere. The bar tenders (and all the staff members) were exceedingly gracious - do tip, although not expected it will be most appreciated. We did not drink the pre-mixed cocktails - although my kids did try - and enjoyed - the pina coladas - both with and without rum. The beach was perfect - the sand, the water, the views - very much as previously described. It truly was a little bit of heaven to sit by the glorious Punta Cana shoreline. The pool was also very nice - it was a bit more active but was a nice alternative for the younger members of our group.The property has been described as not being a five star resort. Certain details may leave one with that impression - but I believe by making the right choices this destination can go head to head with any of the better resorts. Those choices include asking for what you want - top shelf liquor or the opportunity to dine at the restaurant of your choice. This can be accomplished without being obnoxious. This is a resort which aims to please.The front desk could use a bit of work - it does not appear to be adequately staffed and gives the impression being manned by personnel distinctly less gracious than the rest of the resort. Not much has been written about the spa. It is quaint - with a genuine Caribbean feel to it. Not super- luxurious but very nice and fantastically inexpensive especially when one considers the caliber of the resort. The spa treatments (I had two massages and my daughter had a pedicure) were wonderful.Overall I found this resort to be absolutely lovely. It was relaxing in much the same way a cruise is relaxing. It is an incredibly good value. If the resort were to tweak a few minor things it would qualify as the one of the finest resorts anywhere. As it is - it is a place which I would happily return.

<Content>Continues to get better My wife and I were at the Iberostar Bavaro June 23 thru July 2. This was our 5th visit to the resort in the last four years. We would wake up every morning and say another beautiful day in paridise. We continue to be amazed how beautiful the resort is and how friendly and helpful the employees are, from the person cleaning the floors the top management people. We have made many friends and it gives you such a great feeling to see how excited they are to see you again.  We arrived at the Punta Cana airport at 11:30 a.m. and were checked in and sitting down to lunch at 12:30 p.m. while they finished cleaning our room. The food is very good and we have not been sick in any of our visits.There were a few changes which made the resort even better than before. You can now get premium liquor at the pool bar and beach bar, i.e. Stoli, Beefeater, Dewars etc. Before it was only available at the lobby bar. You have to ask for it though. If you ask for a gin and tonic you get house brand so be sure and ask for premium by name. The other change was we had very comfortable pillow top mattress on our king bed, before they were comfortable but rather firm.  We have almost no complaints in our five visits, except maybe the coffee is too strong. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and can't wait until next year for our next visit

<Content>I just don't get the rave reviews! Before I left I read all the raving reviews and picked this resort because of them. I swear I just don't get it. I don't consider myself overly fussy, but I would never go back again. Here are the specifics (and I promise to give credit where I think it is due!):Arrival - no problems. Some confusion about transportation but that was our travel agent's fault. The bus ride to resort was bumpy due to the very bad roads but at least it was air conditioned. Didn't like having to stop at two other resorts first but I expected it.Check in - what a joke. Our travel agent made requests for us, I emailed ahead of time, and we offered money - all to no avail. The room and location we wanted was not available. We settled for second choice but had to change rooms the second day - ugh!Room - as pictured on their website. The bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were beyond awful. Word to the wise - pack your own pillows! The bathroom 'business area' is indeed very tight and my fully grown son felt very squeezed in. The air conditioning was sporatic - sometimes very cool; other times quite uncomfortable. The room itself was quite spacious. I did not really notice a musty smell while I was there but I can tell you there is a smell in my clothes that I promise you is still there after a washing. Maid service - maid kept the room clean, but generally did not respond to notes or requests. And we tipped $10 the first day hoping to avert that problem, without success. Fridge was stocked, but the temperature rarely went above lukewarm.Pool - very nice. The bartenders there were some of the (only) friendly people we encountered at the resort. The swim up bar is fun. We had no trouble finding chairs in the shade at any hour.Ocean - did not spend alot of time there but the beach was beautiful and the sand is indeed like sugar. Looked like palapas in the shade were generally available.Restaurants - another joke. We were supposed to get three reservations in the inside restaurants. We tried to book the first day we were there and were only able to get reservations on two nights - and had no choice of restaurants or nights. The aggravating part is the restaurants were usually half empty when we looked in (or closed - they rotate nights). The food inside was a step up from the buffets.Buffets- they make the best bread I've ever had, and their breakfasts are ok. After that it was really a crap shoot. Some food good; some awful, and I do mean awful. Anyone who raves about the buffets obviously does not mind all of the flies landing on the food which is sitting out often with no refrigeration. Drink the water? - tried to avoid the old montezuma's revenge but half of our party succumbed by the fourth day despite precautions. The other half was fine. I was one of the first half.Service overall - I can honestly say that I found 1/3 of the people to be very friendly; 1/3 of the people to be rather indifferent or just not understanding how to provide service, and 1/3 of the people downright surly. And I tried hard not to be the 'ugly american' - I always am polite and friendly to staff. There is a real lack of English speaking there, but then again I am no wiz at Spanish.Activities - if you're into water sports or aerobics or stuff like that I guess there were some. I personally found little to do. We had a joke with our family - during the day there was mostly just the three s's: swim, swill beer, and swelter in the heat. And OMG was it hot and humid. Two of the seven days there was a breeze which made it bearable. The remainder of the days it was like stepping into a sauna. I am from the north and this was hard for me (although great for swimming.Nightime activities - the casino is small, reeks of smoke, and I am pretty sure the table games are fixed. I love casinos but I spent only ten minutes in this one. The bars are primarily outside - ok on the breezy nights but pretty stiffling on the others. The shows were ok - did not expect cruise ship or LV quality and got what I expected.Shopping - don't bother. Many of the merchants were the rudest people we met and we felt they were really scamming us about the money situation. And there were really very few shops to go to. But there are a couple nice ones in-between the resorts. Did not go off-site for shopping - don't think there is much.Excursions - took the day long (7:00am to 6:00 pm) excursion to Altos de Chavon, the cave, and the lunch raft ride. It was fun during the visiting part but we spent 5 hours (yes, 5 hours!) on a bus there and back on mostly very bumpy bad roads. I swear to you my tail bone hurt the next day. I would not recommend this particular tour just due to the long bus ride.Overall - if you are a beach freak, or love to swim day after day after day and you don't really care much about food or drink quality, go for it - the beach is truly great. But if you do care or like to do things off-site, go somewhere else.

<Content>Sit and Relax My family of 4 just returned from Iberostar Bavaro in PC and here is my take of the resort. I must admit when we arrived on Saturday June 21st I wasn鈥檛 completely thrilled with my choice of vacation spots. Later on that week I realized that I was just uptight and really needed the peace and tranquility that this vast resort offered although my husband wasn鈥檛 particularly happy with the fact that we had to make reservations for the specialty restaurants. It wasn鈥檛 as easy as everyone had mentioned since for some reason the only open reservations were for 9:00pm which is far too late for me and my family. After pursuing the issue a little further we got what we wanted. Cajun (Jumbalaya) 鈥?I enjoyed the main meal (try the flank steak) and the service was ok until a large party of hotel executives arrived and we weren鈥檛 even offered a glass of water never mind coffee after dinner. It looked like the secret service moved in and took over the restaurant. Another point is that even though it was a sit down dinner appetizers and deserts were still buffet style. Not what we were looking for. Oh another thing, my husband noticed that a maintenance person changed a light bulb over the buffet allowing the dust to settle down. Thank goodness we had already taken what we had wanted. Japanese 鈥?The funny thing about this restaurant is that we really didn鈥檛 want to go there but it was the only place available for the time slot we were looking for. We ended up enjoying this the most. Only I warn you after my son just sampled the sushi he was not well for almost 2 days so buyers beware. For dinner we all had the Tappanyaki which is basically grilled food Japanese style. We each had a different combination but sampled each others and it was all good. Try it with the fried rice and you won鈥檛 be disappointed. Steakhouse 鈥?The food here was good as well. I had the spare ribs which were very good and the service was happy and personable. They offer a salad bar which we didn鈥檛 engage in since my husband had the misfortune of finding out they didn鈥檛 clean the salad (lettuce) with bottled water. They must use the local water which didn鈥檛 settle well with my husband for about 1 陆 days. Thank god we were able to pin it down right away. Buffet 鈥?Believe it or not we seemed to be the happiest there. We always sat in the same spot so we would be in Maria鈥檚 section. She got to know us so well she knew what we wanted to drink before we even sat down. My only complaint about the buffet was that there was no Dominican food! Can you believe it, although I can understand it. There are so many different people visiting the resort from so many different places in the world that they tried to please everybody which is not easy.Tipping 鈥?OK everybody brake out a $1 or $2. The people or so wonderful and so happy and they want to make you just as happy. They really work hard for the money. Not that they expect it and sometimes they will even appear to be surprised. Room 鈥?Spacious and comfortable. The bed is great not hard as I read in previous reviews. My sons had the 鈥渕oldy鈥?smell I heard people described. I think it is from the water and not the room since when we checked in it wasn鈥檛 there. Entertainment 鈥?I just need to know where they get all this energy in this heat from. These people work all day. You wake up and they are at the pool generating either an 鈥淥lympic鈥?event or aerobic class. They will always say hello and make sure you are enjoying you stay. Drinks 鈥?Be careful they can be a little sweet and very strong. They can use a little help in this department. We ventured off the premises 2 times 鈥?what a blast!!!!Ziplining with Bavaro Runners (bavarorunners.com) - $89.00 each and worth every dollar. The people who ran it were very patient and made sure you knew what you were doing. It takes about 40 minutes to reach the site and it is not a very comfortable ride but you will enjoy it. Bavaro Splash 鈥?$62.00 each. This was a lot of fun. The first half of the trip is using a 2 man speed boat and there is a tour of about 20 boats. My son drove and they really encourage for you to go as fast as possible. I鈥檓 not sure but I鈥檓 pretty sure there were times that we didn鈥檛 even touch the water. Then they take you to a spot where you snorkel. I wasn鈥檛 sure if I was going to take part in this but my younger son really wanted to do this so I joined him. The water was warm and they gave you fish food which needless to say bought the fish really closed to you. What an experience!All in all with everything I told you my only complaint is that once I started to relax and get into the resort it was time to go home. The week just flew by. Would I go back? In a minute.

<Content>"Awesome Relaxing Week" Just returned from the IBB for a girlfriends get away. We were there 20 - 27 Jun 08. Our request for a 2nd floor room near the beach/pool was granted. We stayed in room 1278 which was near the construction, but we never heard anything. Everything at the resort was wonderful. The food was good. Our favorite was the gourmet restaurant. We also tried the Cajun restaurant and I thought it was pretty good also. We normally ate at the buffet. Never had a problem finding something I liked to eat. Room was great. I did wind up taking a cold shower for a couple days until I figured out that the hot water is on the right instead of the left like at home (LoL)! We took two excursions while we were there. The Outback Safari was a great trip. We learned a lot about the DR. I highly recommend it. We also did the Bavaro Splash. It also was pretty good. We got to drive two-man speed boats and also snorkel in the ocean. The entertainment at night was OK. The star friends put a lot of work into preparing for them. What can I say the Dominican People are wonderful! The weather was good the whole week. We did have a little rain a couple days. It would rain for about 5 minutes and the sun would come right back out. I would not hesitate to book this resort again. The worst part of the whole trip was having to leave.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic !! Hola! My husband, myself and our two friends returned on the 21st June after our two week stay (6/6 to 6/20) where do I start but by saying absolutely brilliant. We all thoroughly enjoyed our two week stay and were very sorry when we had to leave.I felt that I needed to write this review mainly on behalf of the British tourist as there didn't seem to be many. Although since having been and realising that there were very few British at the hotel - why ? I do not know. We travelled with First Choice and everything was absolutely spot on.I emailed the hotel two weeks prior to our arrival and asked for a room overlooking the beach - it couldn't have been better. We were given room 2353 on the second floor - absolutely fantastic - huge bed (apparantly all recently new) flat screen tv, clock radio, coffee machine, iron and ironing board. ~The bathroom was fab - with a huge walk-in shower - which yet again I think was fairly recently renovated as they fitted a new shower door whilst we were there.We certainly had no complaints about the food - the choice was absolutely immense (the only complaint being there was too much to choose from and you just felt that you had to try it all !! - the waistbands prove this !!!)We were able to eat in the speciality restaurants 5 times in total - I think this was because the hotel wasn't booked to capacity - so we asked if we could book more and they willingly obliged !!We ate in the Mediterranean, Japanese and Gourmet 3 times !! I think that says it all.I could go on forever because it was all just so brilliant - we could not fault anything - if there is anything you want, you only have to ask and if they can do it they are only too happy to do so.I was a little apprehensive before going after reading quite a few negative reports - but believe me I think that they were totally unjust. There were no musty smells in the rooms, we didn't hear any noise from the new hotel being built next door (if I hadn't read about it I wouldn't have even known it was there !!) I genuinely believe that if you had a problem they would do their absolute upmost to sort the problem - however large or small - out.We have now been to every Iberostar hotel on the Island - which I think says it all !! - because we know that we will be guaranteed an absolutely fantastic holiday. We would rate this as probably one of the best we have been to - coming very close to the Iberostar Haciendus.

<Content>Best Vacation to Date Our family just returned from Punta Cana. We were there from 6/14 - 6/21/08. This is the first time I feel compelled to write a review about our vacation. My family includes my husband, myself and our two boys ages 11 and 14. Before booking, we searched reviews and chose Iberostar Bavaro. Before leaving, people who had never been to the Dominican would say things like, don't leave the resort or do you know how those people live? which I did not, since I had never been to the D. R. Plus, there was the whole don't drink the water and don't eat anything rinsed or cooked in water. The comments were a bit unnerving, however the trip was paid for and I needed a vacation. I packed Immodium, antibiotics and pepto bismal and off we went.ARRIVAL IN PUNTA CANA:Landing at Punta Cana airport was amazing. The thatched roof of the single level terminal was like something out of a movie. Going through customs was quick and easy. We quickly were directed to our shuttle and off to the hotel. The drive to the hotel was informative, as an Apple Rep. told us not to worry about the ice or foods rinsed/washed in the water because it is 100% purified. The only water you should not drink is tap water, so be careful brushing your teeth. He actually said you could use the water to brush, just don't swallow any. Not to worry. The hotel leaves a gallon of distilled water in the cabinet beside the refridgerator for use in the bathroom. This is in addition to water left for drinking. My concerns about the country began to re-surface on the drive. You could see from the windows of the bus the way some of the people live. It is sad, but not really scarry. Arriving at the resort topped the landing at the airport. The grounds were kept immaculately, almost in a Disney-like fashion. There are many birds (flamingos, ducks, roosters, peacocks, etc.) and a variety of beautiful, tropical plants. We spent time each day observing their habits. You can take bread from the buffet and feed the fish  birds. The open lobby was beautiful. The check-in/out were the only bad part of the trip. Initially, we felt that maybe the customer service was going to be horrible, however once we were checked in and started using the facilities/services, we felt the service was wonderful. Upon check out, they tried to get us to pay $2.00 for a local phone call. It was only $2.00 but it was the principle of it all. I didn't call anyone. I shouldn't pay. It took a good 20 minutes for my husband to attempt to resolve the issue. I was at breakfast with the kids. I went to relieve him and let him eat before leaving. I was about to snap when the issue was resolved and I was given my transfer to the airport.The weather was great, about 90 degrees and sunny everyday, except for the first. Upon arrival, it began to rain. It continued to downpour for the entire day. Rather than let it ruin our fun, we pushed each other in the pool, fully clothed and made our own fun. No one cared.ACTIVITIES  STAR FRIENDS:There are so many activities. The Star Friends (entertainment staff) made the trip. They get to know your name. They try to include everyone in activities. We reluctantly participated in water polo on our second day at the encouragement of a Star Friend, and continued to play each day at 11:30. My husband and I played beach volleyball at 3:30 everyday. We met people from all over the world. It was great. I really enjoyed talking with them, as much as possible (some language barrier at times). The Star Friends would do everything to encourage participation, but also knew when to back off. They called everyone their family and James Bond one of the Star Friends went around introducing my kids as his. Funny because my kids are fair skinned with light hair and James is a native. They had our kids signed up for everything and because the kids liked them so much, they were willng to try anything. By the second day, the kids were doing their thing most of the day, and we were doing ours. I never once felt for my or their safety. THE BARS:The bars were great. There was a beach bar between the beach and our room. That bar had sandwiches, hot dogs and fries from 10:00-6:00 daily. Some limited frozen drinks due to location. The pool bar had everything under the sun and a great bartender Danny (Danilo a fan of Big Poppy). The alcohol (mostly had rum) was fine. They do offer top shelf, you just need to say the word. The beer Presidente was good. It was never really cold, but once it's in the glass, nothing would stay very cold - remember it is above 90 degrees out. THE FOOD:Anyone who says the food wasn't good or available must the pickiest glutton on the planet. My kids and I are very picky eaters. I managed to gain 7 pounds, so, there was definitely enough good food to eat (don't forget, we participated in almost every activity available and ran 2-3 miles 3 days during the vacation, and still put on weight). My kids ate steak for lunch everyday. When we made reservations at a restaurant were weren't sure they would like, or they didn't want to come with us, they went to the buffet. The main buffet was open for breakfast until 10:00 and dinner at 6:30. The food was plentiful and the theme changed daily for dinner. Friday night is the best buffet, with lobster and shrimp, almost like a cruise ship. Don't schedule a reservation on Friday, eat at the buffet.The pool restaurant opened for breakfast at 10:30 and stayed open for lunch and snacks (nachos, popcorn, hot dogs, etc.) until 6:00, then changed over to the Steakhouse. We ate there one night and it was good. We ate at Jambalya (cajun) and it was good. Somewhat elegant and authentic. Also ate at the Mexican restaurant. It was good. Star Rock (the American themed sports bar) was kind of a let down. The service there wasn't great.The only time food/snacks weren't available was between 6:00 and 6:30. You could order room service if you needed to have food in that half-hour.ACCOMODATIONS:Our room was exactly as it appears in the photos. Not a lot of drawers to put clothing, but there are shelves in the closet. The bathroom is large and all stone/marble. Our room attendant was attentive to our needs. Filled the refridgerator daily, without any tipping up front (contrary to what I was told). I just left a note on the pillow asking for bottled water and never needed to ask for anything again. We ended up tipping her well for her exceptional service.WHAT TO PACK:Packing was a challenge. I wasn't sure about dress codes and how strict the hotel would be. Women can wear just about anything (and some do). There was no formal wear needed or seen. Men need to bring a pair of Khakis and shirts with sleeves for dinner. As for shoes, men wore sandals in the restaurants, even the nicer ones, and no one said anything. Basically, if you would wear it to a business casual office, it would be appropriate for dinner. No tank tops for men at dinner. The pool buffet prefers shirts on men and shoes on all, which is a good idea since peacocks wander through and sometimes relieve themselves on the floor. It sounds digusting (and I hate birds) but the staff cleans up a.s.a.p. Bring plenty of sunscreen. My family used 2 Costco sized spray bottles, plus 2 larger tubes of lotion. Still got some minor sunburn. If you run out, you can get it at the gift shop. It was about $12.00 (fairly comparable to home).THE BEACH:The beach is absolutely amazing. Clear water to the buoy line and beyond. Decent swimmers can get out to the line where there is a coral reef (it appears as darker water from the beach) and snorkel. My kids went out there everyday and saw many colorful fish. The beach is pure white sand. There are no rocks or shells. I heard some women go topless. This is true. Most of them shouldn't have. It appeared to be cultural (mostly europeans). It was a bit odd for the kids, but by the end of the week, it seemed commonplace. The funniest statement was when the 11 year old asked me, Are their tops really that hot?SHOPPING:The shopping isn't great. The gift shop at Bavaro is being remodeled. We preferred the gift shop at the neighboring Iberostar Punta Cana. The funniest thing about the gift shop was that they will convert to US dollars, but have no coins. Your change will be dollars and candy. No, really, candy. They have a box next to the register that has a variety of candy, they figure out how much coin change you would get, then give you the equivalent in candy. The street shops aren't great either, though you can negotiate with the sales people. The shop farthest from the beach has the largest variety and decent prices. There are small huts down beach. They are independent shops. You can haggle prices there. I was told their jewelry isn't quality, but I made them prove the Larimar was authentic (they can set a lighter to it and it will not change) and managed to get 2 pendants set in silver for $20.00. At the street shop, the sales person tried to get me to pay $100.00 and was down to $65.00 when I left. The kids got necklaces (shells and hematite) 2 for $14.00.RECOMMENDATION:We have been on cruises and all-inclusives (Aruba/Cancun)before. This was the best. This may be the first one I repeat.I highly suggest this resort for families and couples.

<Content>Needed That Extra Day We spent an absolutely 4 wonderful days/nights in May at the Iberostar Bavaro (should have been 5 [five] except USAir cancelled our flight out and we missed ONE FULL DAY/NIGHT initially) . I was so very upset when I had to leave after this short stay that I booked a full week in December when I returened home :-) What a great place to vacation. The resort is beautiful with immaculate grounds, great management and very hard-working staff in a wonderful location. My one and only complaint isn't with the resort, it is with its vacationers. There are signs posting NOT TO RESERVE THE BEACHUTS;, but believe me, when one goes to the beach, almost all the chairs have towels on them and no one is in residence for many hours. These people are sooooo very inconsiderate and need lessons in manners. Aside from this, I loved everything about the resort. The rooms are spacious and very clean and kept that way all throughout our time there. Mini bar was always replenished and was not lacking. When we arrived, we were given a choice of two rooms (reception had a map of where these rooms were, but never having been there before, we didn' t know and just pointed). We ended up being about one half of the way between the beach and buffet which was fine for us because we had to do more walking to wear off the pounds that one could gain from all the delicious food. All room locations are wonderful, depending upon what is more important to you and how close you wish to be to the beach, main buffet restaurant or main bar that serves top-of-the-line drinks. After checking in, it was suggested we choose our reservations for the speciality restaurants right away (we had a choice of two for the time we stayed there). We chose the Mediterranean (which was OK) and the Gourmet restaurants which was much better. In the Mediterranean, I felt the staff were too pretentious; and they could have been more helpful by explaining the choices on the menu and not rushing you to pick your entree. The appetizer selections were numerous and you pick what you want from a buffet bar. When the wait staff seated us, we were told we SHOULDNT go to the appetizer bar UNTIL we ordered our entree I never was able to figure out the raionale for this and still can't. I love appetizers and thought this was ridiculous. At the Gourmet restaurant, we really felt like we were in a first class restaurant with the attentive service and great food (lobster salad was too die for). So many positive things about this place that I would say that you shouldn't hesitate to book this resort for a wonderful, luxurious vacation. Feel free to email me; and for the short time we were there, I will try to answer any questions that I can.

<Content>Great Week Went to the Iberostar Bavaro with my boyfriend. Overall a great week. The room is huge and the bed is really comfortable. We liked the couch on the balcony. Check in was fast, I asked for a room near the beach and got a perfect spot, just near the pool and the beach and far form the construction work.Food is all right but we both got sick. We went to the Grand Palladium last year and the food was better there, they had special themes everyday so the buffet varied a lot. The buffet at the Iberostar is pretty much always the same everyday. The grounds are superb!! They also have many birds all over the place, flamingos, peacocks... There is a coral reef just in front of the hotel we went snorkelling there and it was awesome! So exciting to see all these exotic fishes. The beach is just perfect, the water is cristal clear, not much seaweed soft white sand.. They also have jacuzzis at the spa and it is very relaxing we went there almost everyday. Pool at the Bavaro is nice but we went to the pool at the Iberostar Dominicana. It doesn't have a pool bar but the set up is much more fun. You have access to the 3 iberostar resorts so it's worth checking it out.The people working there are very friendly, we had a nice service everywhere we went. Some bad things: The animation at the lobby is super loud and you can't really enjoy your time there if you are not interested in the shows. The drinks are not really good even at the lobby. Usually you get better drinks at the lobbys but not there. A pina colada is just a sweet slushie with some rhum. We saw a cockroach in our room. We went to complain at the lobby and they sent somebody right away. She sprayed the entire room and we did not see any more after that but it sure broke the magic. I know just one is not too too bad but I chose this hotel for the good reviews and because I did not see any reviews of roaches, so I was really disapointed to have one in my room.So that's about it, I hope this review helps.

<Content>Amazing Family Vacation Wow! What a vacation. The service we received at this Iberostar resort was amazing. They would not let us do anything for ourselves. We had a 4 and 2 year old with us and they were so attentive to the kids. We are trul;y amazed by our visit and expect to visit other Iberostar properties. The food was mostly good with a huge selection of different cuisine style restaurants. 3 reservations only per room for the specialty restaurants. The all-inclusive alcohol could be better. We are not heavy drinkers and we could tell the difference with the house liquors served. The beer from the tap was never as cold as we like. Non-motorized sports were limited to an hour a day. Not bad considering there is much to do around the property. We went on two excursions that were also great. We swam with the sting rays and did a jeep safari tour. If you visit, try not to buy anything on the tours or if you do, make sure you haggle the price. They will try to squeeze as much out of you as possible. Do not buy the cigars outside of the resort. Most are fakes. I will leave my email address for those with specific questions. I highly recommend this resort for couples or families. We were always made to feel at home.

<Content>Two thumbs up...way UP!!! Hola! My husband and I just returned yesterday :( from our week-long stay (6/6 to 6/13) and we're definitely having withdrawl! This was our first trip to Punta Cana, and our first All-Inclusive. We loved everything about our trip except the fact that we had to leave! I really wanted to write this review because I know how I looked forward to reading them. We booked through an on-line site and it was an Apple vacation out of Cleveland on USA 3000. Everything went smoothly with with our reservation. I requested an oceanfront room, second floor. That's not what we were given upon arrival, but I just asked for one, and, though it wasn't oceanfront, we were re located just behind those that were, on the second floor. We were in suite 2403...loved the location near the beach and pool...a good walk to the lobby and the breakfast/dinner buffet, but really appreciated the lush grounds and beautiful surroundings along the way! The room was just as pictured, nicely renovated-especially the bathroom! We had a new flat-screened t.v., but not one of the new clock radios that I've heard they've been installing...no big deal...brought a travel alarm clock. We had great maid service, with beautiful red flowers left in the bathroom towels each day! We tipped each day for the great service, but I think it would have been the same, tip or not! We always asked for extra water each day because we used the coffee maker each morning...we'rereally early risers, and enjoy our coffee! We found the food to be really good...the breakfast buffet had a great variety of choices, we always found something we liked...the dinner choices were wonderful, too! We always sat near the water where we enjoyed watching the water fowl...and we loved the great service we were given by Juan and Jairon!!! We always ate lunch at the beach/pool buffet and, again, we liked it there, too. Lots of choices...I really liked the pizza and the salad bar, and the ice cream was always refreshing! As far as the drinks go, I really liked the Bahama Mammas, and my husband liked the rum and cokes. We ate at 3 specialty restaurants, the Steakhouse--loved it...the Mediterranean--liked it ...and the Gourmet--absolutely LOVED it...the lobster salad appetizer was to-die-for as was the steak entree and the pineapple sponge dessert w/coconut ice cream! We ate pretty much what we wanted and never felt sick our entire trip!We met many nice vacationers...hola Natalia, Gloria and Philleman from Chile...we miss your warm, friendly smiles! And the Star Friends, who run the activities at the pool each day and the shows at night, do an awesome job making everything so much fun and everyone feel so welcomed! You don't have to do any of the activities...we did the horseshoes, the archery, and the air rifle shoot...I won the horseshoe toss one day and my husband won the archery on another day. When you win, you are invited on stage that night and they present you with a certificate and a t-shirt and everyone sings We are the champions... and though we weren't sure we'd like all that attention...It was great fun!We were very pleasantly surprised to find almost no bugs, and only a few flies and a mosquito or two. We had just one complaint...we had cold showers most of our days there...though we spoke to others who always had hot showers...could have called the desk, but didn't. Absolutely no mold anywhere, no smell in the room and always had a good working airconditioner!!!I realize I'm going on and on...but there's so much to tell...we're looking forward to our next wonderful vacation...hopefully next year! We would highly recommend this resort in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great Resort Our group of 27 stayed at this resort from June 4th-June 11th for my daughter's beach wedding on Friday, June 6th. The wedding photographer assigned to our wedding took many great shots and didn't mind family members taking pictures, either. The wedding coordinator was new to her job and did her best, as some of the smaller details were overlooked. The staff was very friendly, efficient, hard working and made sure you had a great time. The food at the buffet was plentiful and served hot. We never had a problem getting a spot at the pool or beach. The Dominicans appreciate any tips and remember those with better service and a big smile. Remember to bring lots of singles or smaller bills, as the front desk usual doesn't have change. The rooms were comfortable and cleaned early in the day by maids. My clothes did smell a little musty when I returned home, but were fine after washing them. We did the Stingray Bay trip and I would highly recommend this 1/2 day experience. Hint: The hot water in the shower is not all the way to the left, but set the top of the knob to the 1 to 2 o'clock position to get hot water. The only complaint I had was the peacocks. They are beautiful, but make call to each other in the night and expecially early morning, which makes it had to sleep in. They nest in the palm trees or on the balconies. Our room (1093) was in the first bungalow after the lobby area and many nested in trees. Some of our party were away from this area (closer to the pool) and didn't hear them as much.

<Content>Highly Recommend This Resort!!! We have been to the IB Pariaso Lindo in Mexico twice and I can't rave about it enough. But we wanted to try some place different and we were not disappointed. Chose the American Airline vacation package and arrived in DR without a hitch. 30 minute ride to the resort on an AC bus. Check in was great our room was ready. I emailed ahead of time and asked for a newly renovated room on the 2nd floor near the pool and beach.They had my email and gave me exactly what I asked for. Room # 2433. The room was great and no musty smell.The beach is their biggest asset. Beautifull white sand and the ocean is blue green. The water is calm and warm. Most of the days were cloudy but the beach was still great with a nice breeze and the water was warm even thought the sun was not always out. We spent most of the day on the beach then late in the afternoon with went to the pool. Pool was nice but not as nice as the one in Mexico. The food was great. We arrived there on a Friday and that is Lobster night. Which we enjoyed very much. If you are there on a Sat. book the Gourmet Resturant it's Romatic night. You must have the Lobster salad it is unbeliveable.. We were celebrated our Anniversay so it was perfect. We enjoyed it so much we went back again a few nights later. We also ate at the Med. very good Cajun very good Jap. very good Steakhouse skip it. Breakfast and Lunch we ate at the Buffet. We got lazy after a few days so we ate our breakfast at the buffet by the beach. Not as much selection but enough if you don't feel like walking to the main buffet.Shows were entertaining. Drinks were good. Great Lobby Bar.Had a hour massage with oils. We go away every year to different places and I have to say it was the best I ever had. If you decide to get a massage you must ask for Rosa. She was the best.The staff at this resort are friendly and helpful. I know that tips are suppose to be included but I think they see very little of it.So we tip the maid every day and our waiters. If you need a ride to anywhere in the resort all you have to do is call the front desk and in five minutes someone is there to pick you up and take you to where you want to go.Check out was a breeze. Just call ten to fifteen minutes before you have to leave and they will come and get your bags.Well I guess I went on long enough so by now you must have figured out that we had a great time and we highly recommend this resort.I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

<Content>A wonderful vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro My boyfriend and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro resort from May 30th - June 4th. This was my first trip out of the US so I wanted this to be a memorable vacation.....and it was! Check in was very quick and smooth. Immediately after checkin we made reservations for the Japanese and Cajun restaurants.Rooms/Grounds:Afterwards, we (along with our luggage) were taken to our room in a golf cart. We stayed in room 2357 on the second floor. For us, our room was perfectly located right by the pool area and the beach. The walk to the lobby area was a little far however, but we didn't mind at all. It gave us a chance to see the grounds and get in a little exercise after dinner ;o) The rooms look exactly as shown in the pictures.....exactly. The rooms were very nice and spacious. I especially loved the bathroom. I believe we had a newly renovated room because everything in it appeared to be new! We even had the new flat screen tv. Previously I had seen some pictures of rooms with the older model tv's. The bed was extremely comfortable. Not too hard, not too soft. Just right. The temperature in the room was comfortable. There were times when we wanted to turn up the ac but it does not go but so high. That didn't matter to us because there's a ceiling fan right above the bed and it makes a world of difference! I had also read in previous reviews that there were no clocks in the rooms. This was true for us, until about the second day. They happened to be installing clocks in the rooms! Not sure if they did this for all of the rooms but i imagine they did.The Grounds were beautiful! There were always staff tending to the vegitation. Peacocks roamed the grounds and flamingos and ducks lined the pond by the buffet area. This was particularly a highlight for me because I love animals and I had never seen a peacock or flamingo in real life until then!Pool/Beach:The pool was excellent and the beach was exellent....that about sums it up! I was a little worried that the pool bar would be closed for construction while we were there. I had previously read that it was closed for repairs, but luckily it was open. The beach was pretty much what i expected....powder soft sand and clear blue water. There were times however when the ocean didnt seem as clear as i thought it would be. That's because it was mostly cloudy the whole time we were there. But that was ok, a little shade from the sun was needed at times! There are shops on the beach just down from the resort. The vendors can be aggressive. I didn't have a problem with it though. If i did not want something i just said No Gracias and if i did want something, I'd bargain for it.Food/Bars:The food was excellent! The buffet, restaurants that we went to.....Great! I especially loved the breakfast and dinner buffet. There was always something that I liked. Sure they serve some of the same foods every night but that didn't bother us at all. Hey, its all included! We made sure to alternate between eating at the buffet and restaurants on certain nights. They also serve lunch and snacks by the pool and pool bar. I have to say i was a little leary about the food served here. Only because the food sits out in the open for a while if you come to have a late lunch. We just learned to get there early when the food is fresh. The bartenders were great! Our favorite bar tender was Hector. That's a hard working man and he kept the drinks coming!Entertainment:They have shows every night, and they were great. My boyfriend and I were in one of the shows called the Ideal Couple. They had about 4 couples on stage doing crazy games. We got second place and it was a lot of fun! The Star Friends host various activities at the resort throughout the day like archery, rifle shooting, salsa lessons, etc. We did the Bachata lessons.  Excursions:We did the Carribean Festival and the ATV excursions. My favorite was the Carribean Festival. We went snorkeling and swimming with Sting rays and sharks (I believe they were called nurse sharks). This was very fun! They provide you with a life jacket, snorkel gear, and flippers so you just need to bring yourself, a camera, and a towel. I must say, we were a little leary about using the snorkel gear that they provided. These things have probably been passed on from mouth to mouth, person to person, and who knows how well they disinfect the equipment. But no worries, we were prepared so we brought our own snorkel gear.The ATV Excursion was also fun. It gave us a chance to see the Dominican country side and the barrios. We also visited a nice beach( or lake, i forgot the name of it). And a cave that had a natural pool. People jumped in and swam in the natural pool, we didn't though. Also, be prepared to get dirty on this excursion. It had rained a few times while we were there so naturally we drove through some muddy paths. But all in good fun!Overall, this was the best vacation i have ever had. I am new to traveling and a simple person so everything, to me, was top notch. The only slight disappointment was the weather. I was hoping it would be a little more sunny, but oh well. That's nature! We didn't experience any serious stomach ailments while there. We just made sure to watch what we eat and keep hydrated. If something does not smell, look, or taste right to you, DONT eat it. Drink lots of water to stay hydrated in the sun, and from alcohol consumption :o) We brought along some Gatorade for extra replenishment. Also, beware of anything that has coconut in it. Especially the drinks (Coco locos, etc.) I was told that coconut is a natural laxitive so if you have too much, you may be running to the bathroom all night! So we didn't bother with it. I highly recommend this resort. The people there are wonderful! If you have any questions just let me know! I'll try to answer what i can.

<Content>The best vacation yet!!! I just came back from staying at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana. We stayed 7 nights, May 22-28th. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews on here before deciding where to stay. I must admit I don't know why anyone would give a bad review for this place! I think people just like to complain. The food was excellent, drinks were great, people were very friendly, pools were huge- loved the swim up bar, and we did 2 excursions that were so much fun! We did the Stingray Bay Excursion where we went on a boat and got off to snorkel then we went farther out to an area to swim with sharks and stingrays! The 2nd excursion was an all day trip around the Dominican Island where we saw a dominican home, cigar factory,sugar cane plantation, school, had lunch on top of the mountain. You really don't need any money except for excursions or any gifts you want to buy, they dont expect any tips there although we tipped almost everyone because they were so friendly and helpful. We are already thinking of booking the same hotel next year. The front desk was very helpful and I suggest booking all your Al La Carte dinner reservations the night you get there, that is what we did. We stayed 7 nights so we got 3 places to try, although we went to 4 because they had a special couples night at one place which was very nice. The bufffet had great food too though, I wouldn't of minded eating there every night!Oh and the shows everynight were great, we weren't too into the dancing ones, but we loved the comedy nights. We are both 28, and my bf had his birthday while we were there so I asked the staff to celebrate his bday. They called him up on stage, sand happy birthday to him and gave him a t-shirt on stage. It was a great time, and I can't wait to go back. If you have any questions or anything just email me and ill be happy to help!

<Content>Paradise in Punta Cana We stayed in Punta Cana from May 16th through May 23rd. This was our first trip to Punta Cana and we already booked a return trip to IBB in May 2009. We booked our trip through Apple and had a direct flight from BWI to Punta Cana. The airport was amazing and very efficient from landing, going through customs, to collecting our luggage and finding our transfer to IBB.Check in-we had to wait for our rooms for about 2 hours after we arrived. We ate lunch and walked around the facility--which was amazing!!! We thought our rooms were perfect--newly renovated and close to the beach. Rooms 2383 and 2384 our brother and sister in law joined us and we were more than happy with the rooms. The food was good at the buffet--the beach lunch buffet was the best. We enjoyed ribs, lobster, pizza, hamburgers, steak, fresh fruit and the ice cream was wonderful. The speciality rest. that we enjoyed the best was the LaCouples. The lobster salad was amazing and the service remarkable! I read many many reviews for a few months before our trip and lots of people complain about the food, but we always found something to eat and had no complaints! We went with the attitude that we didn't need to cook for a week and we were going to have fun regardless of what type of food, rooms and entertainment we found. We were pleasantly surprised to find paradise in everything!! The weather was perfect--only small amount of showers 2 times during our week stay overnight. The beach was paradise. We spent most of our days at the beach and our nights after dinner in the casino at IBD (which was small, but we had many laughs and a good time spending a few bucks and winning a few bucks).We went on a few excursions--Marinarium was wonderful. It was our first adventure snorkling and we enjoyed seeing the land from the boat. We also did the safari outback and we were Eddie's family for the day and were treated like royality! It is nice to see how the domincan's live and see the country side!Our husband's went deep sea fishing and caught 6 mahi-mahi's. The enjoyed there day fishing and would encourage anyone that is interested in fishing to book a half day of fishing.We had several massages on the beach and that was awesome!At the end of the week we asked each other-was there anything that we were unhappy about?? We all answered NO. It truly is paradise and everyone should experience Punta Cana in their lifetime!!!We are counting the days until we return in May 2009!!!!

<Content>A dream wedding We were at the Bavaro from 5/17 to 5/27 for our wedding and honeymoon. We had 17 adults in our party ranging in age from 21 to 81 and everyone had an awesome time. The wedding was more spectacular than we could have hoped for. If you are looking for a beautiful ceremony that you don't have to micro-manage, than this is the way to go. Video, video, video. Buy the video. They do an awesome job, it was the best money we spent. It absolutely captured the emotion of the ceremony and beauty of the surroundings. All the details were above and beyond including the flower arrangements which were gorgeous, they did my hair exactly how I wanted it, the cake was the best ever, etc. The grounds were immaculate and just stunningly beautiful. We ate at several of the restaurants and enjoyed every meal, but I have to say the Japanese was my favorite. The staff was friendly and accommodating but certainly worked at an island pace, something northerners have to learn to adjust to. We loved the beach, the beach bar, the pool, the entertainment and the disco. We can't wait to make a return trip.

<Content>Really good, but not as great as I expected The hotel is physically attached to the other two lower class iberostar hotels so technically all three hotels share the same grounds although people seem to stay within their grounds. Demographics seemed to be mostly middle class European and American in their late 30s to 50s at Iberostar Bavaro and lower middle class and young student groups in the other two hotels with fewer children The Bavaro Iberostar is a good clean hotel for a family vacation with decent size rooms, no insects within the compound (I saw personnel fumigating constantly) and well manicured from a landscaping perspective. The service and personnel are truly amazing, these people are so good at making you feel like the king.The best feature in my opinion is Lucys Club, a 9am to 5pm kids club that allows for the parents to do adult activities while the kids as a group go everywhere from the mini golf, to the beach, to the pool and they also have a small musical show at 7:30 every night (all the kids dance and sing)The pool is nice but too shallow and small. The buffet food is just above average, while they have a fairly large selection of everything nothing is out of this world or impressive. Hot dogs and burgers are served daily for lunch. The alcohol is mostly well drinks, no quality alcohol is served. The gourmet restaurants are honestly not gourmet, just average food coated with excellent service.Activities seemed to be limited to the typical, although water motor sports are non existant. I took scuba diving lessons and had a great time. The night shows are really amusing and enterntaining for the whole family and it's a good way to enjoy some time together after dinner.Overall it was a great family vacation if you don't want to go for the high end resorts.

<Content>Excellent stay. Highly recommend We vacationed at the Iberostar from May 25th - 28th. For those on considering this property...just go. My wife and I went for our anniverasary and had a wonderful time. The reviews are correct. Very clean, staff very friendly, food choices plentiful and good. Drinks abundant. It is a large property and it appears that during this time the occupancy was about 50%. Recommendations: Do email the hotel in advance and dont be shy. about a request. We requested a second floor, oceanview, away from construction, with a king bed. When we arrived the desk person had the email and we had an awesome room assignment. I think it was 2363 (still fuzzy from the drinks!)Lunch buffet in the main restaurant was almost empty with great choices while the pool buffet was more crowded.Tip $2 dollars a day and beers and waters will fill your fridge.Choose Bavaro over the other properties This was noticeably an upgrade from the other two iberostar properties.Lobster salad at the gourment restuarant was awesome.Massage was actually very relaxing - $25 for 1/2 hour. Ignore the porters at the airport unless you want them to transport your suitecase 20 ft.Drink the pina coladas in moderation since they are made there with cocunut milk and serve as a laxative to some. Just advice from one of the staff there.Stick to bottled water but you can brush your teeth with the room water.You can have a busy vacation with all the activiites...archery, spanish lessons, volleyball, step classes etc. or you can drink like a fish and sunbath under an umbrella all day long.The beach is beautiful and great for walks. many topless women which may offend or excite some. Gentlemen, no Carmen Electra or Pam Anderson running on the beach so dont get your hopes up.Pick this resort for fun, relaxation, clean quality accomodations and to be around nice people.

<Content>Nice Resort We were there from 5/17 to 5/22 with a total of 10 people. 7 adults and 3 kids ages 3 or less. This was my fourth all inclusive experience so I am comparing with the others I've been before. Just to start with the weather: very nice the whole trip and never rained. It was hot but the beachside breeze made it very tolerable.Airport-open air style with no AC but arriving was easy and no lines. You pay $10 each person including my 15 months old and getting luggage was no hassel. The ride to the hotel was bumpy but I enjoyed looking at the scenary of Punta Cana.Hotel check in-We arrived at 1pm and our three rooms were not ready. They told us they will get right to it and we can come back in 45 minutes. Meanwhile we got our welcome drink and wrist bands so we can go have lunch. We returned 90 minutes later but rooms not ready yet. All ten of us with kids hung out in the lobby for another 45 minutes but only one room was ready by that time. It has been 30 minutes passed check in time already. We all decided to go to the one room that was ready while we wait since at least we will be in the air condition. This was probably the most annoying part of the entire trip. We also booked all the dinner reservations in the lobby (they start booking at 3pm) which was very easy.Hotel itself-very clean, grounds beautifully manicured, and peacocks all over the place. Our rooms are one block away from the new construction which was very loud once you step outside your room. In the room however, we didn't hear anything. The room is large enough for a family of four. Sofa bed pulls out to a comfortable bed. There are two steps down to the living area so small kids need to be careful. Bathroom is large enough to function but will not fit two people comfortably at the same time. The tiles and marble are a nice touch though. There is a vanity mirror and a blow dryer in the bathroom. The outlets are just like US so no converters needed. The AC is strong in the room that we had to turn it off at night. The refrigerator in the room has plenty of water and beer but not very cold. We tip the maid but didn't get more soda when we asked. We used the safe in the room and don't forget to get a key from the front desk in order to use it. The maid service otherwise is timely.Beach-one of the lovelist I've ever seen. The waves are gentler than in cancun and in cabos. The water was of torquois color which was so charming. The white powder sand felt so good underneath your bare feet and waves crashing sound was soothing.. There are rock/corals in the water so make sure everyone including kids wear water shoes. Bring some sand toys like a shovel/bucket which kept the kids busy for hours. There are no rocks or anything in the sand so the kids did very well playing with them. The palapas are plenty but people do reserve early. If you don't care to be at the front row by the beach, there is always open ones in the back available. The sun is strong and suntan lotion needs to be applied multiple times a day. Most of us got burned even with plenty of sunscreens laying around. There are alot of activities on the beach like parasailing, windsurfing, etc. They are located near the dominican and punta cana side. We did parasailing and it was lot of fun. We went to the shops on the beach but most of their stuff are of low quality. It was amazing they wanted 25 dollars for a homemake bracelet that was bargained down to $5. The cigar shop had fake cigars and can be bargained down to something very cheap like $15 for a box of ten but good quality ones can be bought in the hotel store. Pool-A large portion of the pool was closed for construction and opend after we left. There is also a kiddie pool that is warm and shallow for little kids to play in where we spent alot of our time. We did to to the punta cana and dominican side b/c there were two large free forming pools side by side. These pools were very nice and much better than the pool at the Bavaro side. There are alot of chairs by the pool side saved by people from the night before. We found palabas close enough by the pool and still enjoyed our day. All the pools were clean and there are water volleyball, aerobics, plus other acitivies daily that looked like fun.Food-breakfast and lunch buffets are pretty good and enough varieties for everyone. There are enough choices for little kids like eggs, pancakes, pastas, vegetables, juices, milk, cereal, ect. There are also high chairs in every restaurant. There are alot of flies however b/c all buffets are open air restaurants. The poolside lunch buffets are better than the lobby one. The punta cana/dominican pool side lunch buffets are not as good as the Bavaro side. We ate dinners at the Japanese, Mediterranean, Jambalaya cajun, and steak house. Our favorites are the cajun and steak house. The quality of food is not the best we had but better than alot of high end restaurants in the US. The fish dish at cajun and japanese are excellent. There are plenty of fruit juices and fresh fruits at every meal. They even serve mamosa at sunday breakfast. There are also ice cream stands that we go all the time. There are always plenty of food around. We even get a plate of nachos as afternoon snack before dinner. The drinks are good but we only drink soda and mixed drinks. The poolside and lobby bars are the best. The beach one and the one by punta cana/dominican side really isn't very good. The down side is that if I wanted a mixed drink at a dinner restaurant, I have to go to the lobby bar to get it or one of the waiters may be nice enough to go get one for me. They only have beer/wine/shelf drinks at the restaurants. We didn't order any room service but the menu is very very limited only to sandwiches and hamburgers.Service-all services are excellent. Everyone says hello and works hard especially the waiters and waitresses. The people working at the beach sports centers are very rude however. One has to book ahead of time in order to borrow the sailboat for an hour. We stayed at Iberostar Lindo in Mexico and just walked up to them and got the sailboat immediately. I see the reviews and everyone says they tipped but I have not seen one person tip during the entire stay whether or not they are Americans or Europeans. We did tip plenty however and glad we did. They are all hard workers and really appreciated the tip.Overall, we enjoyed the trip were glad to see punta cana. We have stayed at Iberostar Lindo/Maya before in Mexico and thought that they were so much better however. They had the wave pool and the lazy river which would have been fun for the kids. If I ever return to punta cana, I wouldn't mind staying at Iberostar Bavaro again.

<Content>Wonderful vacation! We just got back from a week vacation in the Dominican. We stayed at the all inclusive resort, Iberostar Bavaro. What a wonderful vacation this was. We arrived at the airport in Punta Cana in the rain. Not what I was hoping for. We walked/ran in the rain from the plane to the airport, took pictures with the locals and located our transport (VIP Travel). By the time we arrived at our resort the sun was shinning. Not sure when it came out because I had my eyes closed most of the way as I did not want to see the oncoming traffic as it would unnerve even the calmest person!We were greeted as soon as we got out of the van, checked in, given a glass of a frozen drink, got a map to our room and we were off...The luggage almost made it to our room before us. I was so pleased with the grounds on the way to the room. There were peacocks everywhere and the landscape was immaculate. Our Room was beautiful and very roomy. I cant say enough good things about the service and facilities. I have been to Jamaica, Grand Camens, Cancun, Ixtapa, Cozmel, this was my first visit to the Dominican. I would choose this destination over all the others that I have been to.The food really impressed us. It was wonderful and such a huge variety, we never ate anything we didnt like. The entertainment was great and the bartenders were tremendous. If you go, be sure and find Wildon the bartender. He will take care of you!Did lose my diamond tennis bracelet there...It had nothing to do with the resort and everything to do with my boyfriend bending over while laughing so hard, my bracelet fell out of his pocket. the laughter.....well, it was because I had slipped and fell down after leaving the bar one night!! He did help me up...once he could catch his breath.We will return next year!

<Content>Mario the wonderful steak man! Great hotel - staff, food, grounds all very good. From reception staff, through waiters, maids and gardeners - all happy to help! The chef doing the steaks in the buffet restaurant made out stay - on the last night, he prepared two specially saved halves of cow and presented them to us, cooked in all sorts of herbs and spices! Great! We couldn't fit vegetables on the plate, the steak was that huge! All the A-la-cartes good but we were swayed towards the buffet and those lovely beef-steaks! Room good - nice shower and bath with shower, all good air-con. The 'mouldy' smell was not apparent and all was well; room cleaned early morning by Carmen. We were in room 2054 - overlooking lovely grounds with peacocks. All in all, a great holiday and one which I would not hesitate repeating!

<Author>TheNewTaylors
<Content>Lived up to the hype! We stayed from the 5th-19th May for our honeymoon and highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro.Transfer time from Punta Cana airport 30-45mins. Getting through the airport was less painful than anticipated. We purchased our tourist cards in advance, but it cost twice as much. It did not seem any hassle at all to buy them at the airport upon arrival, which is what we wish we had done.Check in at the hotel was smooth, complete with Banana Mama upon arrival. We rented a safe in our suite for $2 a day.The junior suite was very impressive. I think we may have been lucky enough to get a recently refurbished room, no musty smells, air con worked fine, beds huge and very comfortable. Good size bathroom with separate shower cubicle and bath.Our suite was perfectly located for both the pool and beach. Blocks (which house 8 suites each) numbered 234,235 and 236 are in the same area. We were in 2365, a ground floor suite. 5 minute stroll to the lobby, bars and buffet/restaurants.Its worth tipping the maid a dollar a day, it keeps the minibars well stocked with what we wanted and we are convinced that the lovely little touches the maid did to the room were as a result of tipping.Staff are friendly and helpful, good levels of service, it was near impossible to have an empty glass. Make sure you tip for good service, make the effort to pick up a few words in Spanish, it makes a big difference.We confirm that pathways are hazardous when wet. My wife tells me the paths are not for high heels, flat shoes are the way to go.Grounds are stunning and impeccably maintained and contain amazing wildlife.Huge pool with complete with swim up bar. The swim up section of the pool (about one third of the area of the pool) was closed for refurbishment from the 4th day and this was still going on when we left. It was disappointing, but its an all year round resort, so it has to be done at some point and I guess as the low season has just got underway and the rainy season is coming it seems a sensible time to do such work.Beach is by far the best we have encountered, a tropical paradise. No trouble getting a palapa, but if you insist on a front row palapa, get there by 9-9.30.Breakfast and lunch buffets are of good standard. For lunch, the poolside buffet offers a wider selection. We found the evening buffet below par. However we both suffered with stomach problems which took the edge of our appetite and could well have clouded our judgement and we may have been over critical because of this. Stomach problems or not the Gourmet restaurant was great.We ordered room service one night, took about 40 minutes and was of a decent standard.We tried hard to listen for construction noise throughout but could hear none. We ventured to the south side of the resort and did hear moderate construction noise. To avoid this being a problem within the suites try to avoid suite numbers starting in one (buildings 101-132). In our opinion, if you choose suite numbers starting in a 2 or a 3, you should have no problems.

<Content>Great Vacation! My husband  I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 4/27 to 5/4. The trip from the airport to the resort took approx. 30 minutes. We had an early flight and arrived at the resort prior to the check-in time so our room was not quite ready. We were given our wrist bracelets and relaxed with cold drinks and were soon able to check-in. Although our room wasn't fancy it was spacious, clean and comfortable. We did not have a large flat screen T.V. as some reviewers have mentioned but that was okay as we didn't plan to spend much time in the room anyway. I thought it would have been nice if the bathroom could have been larger. I also would have preferred a bit more privacy on the balcony but all in all it was a very satisfactory room, located not too far from the beach, yet a decent walking distance to the main dining areas.The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we always enjoyed our walk to and from dinner in the evening. Lots of peacocks, flamingos and various other birds. Of course, as every one has mentioned, the beach is beautiful and you can walk either way for miles, which we did. We enjoyed walking past the other resorts and thought the Iberostar properties had the nicest palapas and loungers - with plenty to go around. We never had a problem finding a spot to relax on the beach or around the pool.I enjoyed getting fresh fruit drinks from the little health bar by the pool. They had fresh papaya, apples, watermelon, pineapple, carrots, cucumbers, etc, ready to be blended into any combination you chose - it was great! The drinks at the pool bar were just okay, in my opinion. We really preferred the lobby bar for the best drinks, and it was a nice place to relax before and after dinner, sitting at one of the little tables or up at the bar. The evening entertainment was a little of a disappointment, not as good as what we enjoyed in Mexico but it was okay.The food was good, especially the breakfast buffet. Lots to choose from. We ate at 3 of the speciality restaurants; the Gourmet, the Asian, and the Cajun - the Cajun was our favorite.And finally, but probably most importantly, all of the staff were wonderful. I wish I could remember all of their names but these two really stood out and they were fabulous: Manual and Gregory - they made us feel special because they made a point of remembering us by name and what we liked. Keep in mind that this is at a resort with close to 600 rooms and literally hundreds of guests that usually change on a weekly basis! That's what customer service is all about and these employees do an exemplorary job! If we had to rate this resort based on employees alone we would give it a 5!

<Content>loved the Iberostar Bavaro My husband and I stayed @Iberostar Bavaro May 11th-18th of this year. We loved it. Quick smooth check-in. The grounds are amazing. Room close to the pool and beach. Room clean, no funny smells, A/C worked well, lots of hot water for the shower, mini-refrig well stocked daily. Food in the buffets very good, large variety. Ala-carte restaurants we were able to make four reservations for a week stay. Enjoyed all four of them. The beach was the best I've been to. The sand is like powder, the water clear and warm. Lots of chairs to choose from. Good snorkeling in front of the resort. Staff very friendly and helpful, some language barrier, we speak very little Spanish, but we made out just fine. We went fishing on Tue., we caught three large mahi mahi, we were the only boat out of five to bring in fish.We did go on the Saona Island tour, DON'T GO, it was a three hour bus ride(two hours to pick up other guests from other hotels then another hour to get to the harbor. ) Once you get to the island it is lunch and swim alittle, then a boat ride to swim with star fish( not alot of star fish around). Back to the harbor and another three hours on the bus. A TOTAL OF SIX HOURS ON THE BUS. I would have stayed at the resort and enjoyed the pool and beach there. That was the only down point to the trip.Yes we will be going back to Iberostar Bavaro

<Content>Middle of the Road I really looked at this website a lot before my trip, so I felt I needed to submit my opinion:The hotel: Pretty nice hotel, nothing that will blow you away. The rooms were large and kept pretty clean. We were in room 1087 which was VERY close to the beach and pool, though our AC never worked. Every time we called, a person would be out in 20 minutes to fix it, but then it would go out again. It wasn't worth me changing rooms. They have little built-in couches on the patio, which I loved. Food: Again, food was fine, nothing to ride home about. We did go to the Japanese restaurant and that was pretty good! The buffets had a wide variety to choose from. Drinks: The hotel was very gracious as far as liquer. No one at the hotel was stingy at all. The front bar has call the name-brand stuff. If my drink was half full, they would be sure to make sure it stayed completely fullPunta Cana: A little scary. but I fely COMPLETELY safe in the hotel. The airport consists of grass huts...very funny. Beach: Pretty nice, never had a problem getting a hut. I had thought the water would have been clearerStomach issues: Nada. The hotel was really good about making sure things were sterilizedPeacocks: I was surprised that not a single person mentioned the peacocks. Though they are beautiful, they howl...all night and early morning.....Overall I had a great vacation because of who I went with. Do expect some 5-star lap of luxury, just be realistic and you will not be disappointed. I did look at the other Iberostars while I was there and Bavaro was by far the best.

<Content>"absoloutely loved this place" My boyfriend and I stayed here for two weeks in August 2007. We are both in our early 20's and we absoloutely loved this place.It was the first time we had stayed all inclusive and this resort catered for all of our needs. I think we spent about 拢300.00 in the whole two weeks, and that was mostly used on tips, suncream and a day out.When you arrive at the airport it is a hut made of what looks like straw and you are met by traditional Dominicans playing music for you. Its lovely and very effecient. Check in was fast and effecient (met with an ice cold smoothy, just what we needed).We had a room right at the front by the main restaurant and bar. This could get a little loud of a night time due to the bar, but it didnt really bother us as we were usually at the bar until the enterainment finshed anyway. It was handy to just wake up in the morning and breakfast was only across the pathway. Please be aware it is so hot here. I made the mistake of not putting any sun block on at all on our first day (silly I know), and I have never been in so much pain, my whole body was red raw for days and I was given antibiotics etc from the Chemist. I had to stay in for four days! PLESE WEAR CREAM. The resort is spotless, it was always being cleaned and our maid was great. It does help if you just leave a coupkle of dollars every few days or so for your made, they really appreciate and clean your room with that special touch. The entertainment was fab, very light hearted but always funny. Lots of activities going on in the day time, the animation team are really friendly. We found the food to be great. I am quiet a fussy eater and I never stopped eating, there is something for everyone and all meal times. Plus you also have the beneift of using the sister hotel and all of their facilities/restaurants if you fancy a change of scenary. The Cajun and Japenese restaurants were lovely, weren't so keen on the mexican or steakhouse though. The landscape is beautiful, there are peacocks and flamingos just pottering around the place. The pool area is fab, pool bar and swim up bar great, the service is spot on too, our waiter would see us without a drink and just bring a couple over for us. The beach was amazing, so clean and you can always get beds and there is a beach bar too. We were a bit worried that we would get bored here, but if you're like us and like to go on holiday to just relax and chill out then this resort is a must. We only went on one trip which was the Monstor Truck. Its a whole day out on a big open truck (it can be quiet bumpy!), you see how the village people live, explore the city, go to a local school, go up the mountains, you go horseriding and end the day at a gorgeous beach. There is a nightclub here, about six speciality restaurants, spa, chemist, bank, general shop etc (no newspapers or magazines), everything you could need really. Girls - please note due to the electricity here my hairdyer wouldnt work properly and was just blowing a mere whistle out, just a word of warning if like me you need to blow dry your hair - mine was left wet for two weeks. We didnt see any bugs at all although please use mosquito repelant of a night, we did and my boyfriend only got bit once!On the flight coming homke we upgraded our flight seats to Premiet at 拢100.00 each. This was at a half price discount and was well worth it as my boyfriend is over 6ft and the journey was made so much comfy. Overall this place is wonderful, far exceeded our expectations and would definately return here in a few years.

<Content>Loved the Iberostar Bavaro This was my 4th all-inclusive vacation. We have stayed at 3 Iberostars in Mexico, this was our 1st trip to the D.R. This was the best Iberostar that I have stayed at so far.Check-in went very smooth. Only took about 10 min. Got king bed, safe, 1st floor and away from contruction near the pool on upon my request.Grounds were amazing. They have plenty of walkways, but slip off your shoes and walk on the grass a little. It is better than the softest carpet you have every been on. The workers are constantly working on the landscaping and it shows.Rooms were really nice and clean. Bathroom was very nice with seperate shower and tub. Lots of hot water. No musty smell. Mini-fridge was stocked everyday. Living area very nice for room service and TV watching while my wife got ready and NBA playoffs.Pool was within 30 yards of our room. We stayed in 2506. The pool was a little cool, but felt great after you got used to it. The swim up bar is a must. Well worth the extra money to have the swim up bar at the Bavaro. The other 2 Iberostars that share the property do not have a swim up bar. There is a deeper area to the pool for swimmers and water polo.Beach has the best sand I have ever walked on, like powdered sugar. There are some rocks/coral in the water, but just look for the clearings in between the coral outcroppings and you will be fine. The ocean water is also cool and calm. There is a reef about a 1/4 mile out that shelters the beach from big waves. There are some small waves, but mostly wakes from boats going back and forth just outside the no wake zones.Food was the best of all. Breakfast is always good at any of the all-inclusives. We always ate lunch by the pool. No need to walk all the way back to the front of resort for lunch. Save room for the a la cartes. Make your reservations right after you check-in or as soon as you can if the desk is closed. We stayed 7 nights so we got 3 reservations. We got 3 more by checking at the desk on the other days. Does not hurt to ask for extra ones. We ate at the Japanese. It was really good, but the did not cook right in front of you. We ate at the Cajun 2 times. It was good too. We had the Medditerrean once it is good for seafood. The best is the Gormet and we had it twice. Do not miss it. First class service there.Shows were better at this resort too. Make sure you go on the nights they have the professional dancers. They are great. Also, if you like to dance, they have dancing for people before and after the shows every night. The bar by the theater is a don't miss too. Introduce yourself, shake their hand and make a friend. Some of the nicest people we have ever met on a vacation. Shout out to you Hector and Daniel Salas. Tip these guys because they will treat you right. There is so much more I could talk about. If you have any questions what so ever, feel free to ask me. We explored the whole property.

<Content>Beautiful resort but beware construction Our trip was planned through Apple Vacations. The flight on USA 3000 from Baltimore was without delay and very pleasant. The check in at the Iberostar Bavaro went smoothly. THEN we were taken to our room no. 1035. We were on the first floor and had a terrace. The view from our terrace was a three story green canvas wall that was so close you could spit on it. On the other side of the wall was a huge construction site for a new resort. The construction crew began yelling to each other and banging away at 6:00 a.m. and the large crane didn't quit until 11:00 p.m. Our hearts sank. My husband and I hadn't been on a trip together for 24 years and looked forward to a tropical getaway. This wasn't what we had dreamed of. SO...we paid the front desk staffer a large tip and begged to be moved to another room. Even though this predicament overshadowed the vacation, we eventually got a second floor room with a garden view and had a fabulous time. It's unfortunate that Iberostar would even place guests next to the construction. Apple Vacations apparently keeps it a secret from the travel agents also. Just take that extra cash with you.

<Author>marcopolo1964
<Content>great choice for an all-inclusive The Iberestar Bavaro was our first experience with an all-inclusive resort. We'd always traveled independently before and looked down on all inclusive resorts. But after some exhausting holidays with our 3 陆 year old we decided to give one a try. We're glad we did. The setting is lovely, the staff is friendly, the food is more than adequate. The drawback, as with any international resort, is that you could be just about anywhere in the world and there's no real contact with the country you're in. That wasn't much of a problem in this case because we were looking for a relaxing stay at the beach, and were well aware it would be a culturally zero trip. You also must accept that this place is large and therefore won't have intimate and personalized service. But when they say all inclusive, they really mean it. There's food and drink available around the clock. They provide beach towels, and have books and games available. Besides tips, the only extra money I spent the whole vacation was $14 to rent a key for the safe. The resort is made up of two-storey eight-room units spread around lovely gardens full of tropical flowers and birds. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, though they lack a bit of local charm. They could be from any chain hotel in any corner of the world. They are also a bit dark because they are well shaded from the hot tropical sun. The bathroom was functional and clean. For a privacy and air, try to avoid a ground floor room. And ask for rooms away from the swimming pool (cooking smells from the beach restaurant) and away from the lobby (music at night). Though, if you keep the windows shut and the a/c on at all times, neither is much of a problem. The beach is truly beautiful, with soft white sand, clear blue water, and a near forest of coconut trees. While there are lots of people walking back and forth along the beach from adjacent resorts, it's wide enough to avoid feeling crowded. We also walked up and down the beach and never saw another resort we'd have rather been at. The Iberostar's beach was the widest and had the best options for shade, with plenty of palm leaf palapas while other hotels either relied on the inadequate shade of the palms trees or had ugly plastic huts. Just behind the beach is a large and varied swimming pool with plenty of both shallow and deep areas, and various bridges and fountains to keep kids amused. This is the tropics and we did get some brief heavy showers. The sun always reappeared before long. I wouldn't go a large resort hotel for gastronomical reasons, but we had no complaints about the food. There's a large eating area off the central lobby surrounded on two sides by a garden pond filled with flamingos and herons, where breakfast, lunch and dinner are served buffet-style. Breakfast is copious and varied, with eggs, pancakes and bacon for the North Americans, pastries for the southern Europeans and Latin Americans, cold cuts and smoked fish for the Nordics, and plenty of tropical fruits and juices for everyone. We always ate lunch down by the beach where there were grilled meats and fish, vegetables, and salads, with occasional specials such as paella. Dinner was a bit more complicated. You have the right to reserve a certain number of meals in the resort's ``specialty'' restaurants depending on how many nights you are staying. We ate in the Mediterranean, Cajun, and Seafood restaurants. The food and service was fine in all of them, but nothing special. We didn't enjoy them that much more than the regular dinner buffet, especially because the Med and Cajun restaurants were indoors and refrigerated well beyond normal air conditioning whereas the lobby eating area is bathed in lovely tropical breezes. The whole ``specialty'' restaurant reservation system is a bit overly complicated, and we were often told a place was full when there were empty tables. Between meal hours there's a reduced buffet laid out at the beach restaurant that would count as a full meal in most hotels. My main complaint is that there wasn't enough Dominican food, which is tasty and filling. The local beer is decent. The Spanish wines served with dinner are on the cheap side but you don't go to the Caribbean for the wine. We're not big drinkers so can't judge the booze, but there seemed to be plenty of satisfied people at the various bars. We caught bits of the nightly floorshow which were entertaining in a cheesy way. Still, this is very much a resort for families or quiet couples. There were some groups of 20-somethings looking for a good time, but this is not a party scene. The week we spent at the hotel we had Americans, Canadians, Russians, French, Germans, Spanish, Dutch, British, Ukrainians, Czechs, Italians, and Argentines, with no group dominating and everyone getting along fine. We went largely for our daughter and she had a blast, looking for the peacocks that populate the gardens, making sand castles, splashing around in the pool and sea, dancing in the kid's show every night at 7:30, and making friends. She usually crashed during dinner from all her exertions. There was what seemed a well equipped club for kids 4 to 12. We never tried to enroll our daughter because that wasn't our goal on the trip. There's a 24-hour medical office that thankfully we never had to test. We also never used the tennis courts or the twice-a-day boat trip to snorkel a nearby reef. There's a gym with some outdated weight machines. There are also stores selling local artifacts (not impressive), some attractive clothing, and basics such as suntan lotions, aspirin and snacks. All in all, I'd highly recommend this resort to any family looking for a relaxing quality stay by the beach. And I'd also recommend the Iberostar Bavaro over its adjacent sister hotels, the Iberostar Punta Cana and Iberostar Dominicana. The Bavaro has its rooms in small units spread around a garden while the Punta Cana and Dominicana's rooms are in what looked like airless blocks. There is a stunning pool and garden between the Punta Cana and Dominicano which anyone in the complex can use. I'm amused by some complaints about this hotel in other entries. First, that there are too many Europeans. This is a Spanish-owned resort on a Spanish-speaking island popular with Europeans. Stay home if you can't share the planet. Topless sunbathing? Most of the clients are European. Deal with it. Bad food? As I said, it's not a gastronomic experience, but the food is good, abundant and varied enough that even the pickiest eater should find plenty to eat. Unhelpful staff? Well, they aren't servile. If you smile and make an effort to say a few words in Spanish, they go out of their way to be helpful. We left a dollar a day for our maid and gave $20 to guy who checked us in. After that, we had no trouble getting what we wanted (a room change, extra towels, keeping our room late the final day). We'll be back.

<Content>Amazing! This was mine and my husbands 3rd all-inclusive. We've did Marriott Aruba, RIU Cancun and Iberostar Bavaro Punta Cana. I still liked Aruba better, because we didn't have to eat at a buffet. Please keep in mind that if this is your first all-inclusive, the food and scenery would be 100% AMAZING. I would say 90%, only because I liked Aruba better. Check In- Absolutely wonderful. They originally had us on the first floor; however, after reading about the girl whose safe was stolen, I requested a second floor room. At first she hesitated saying I was in prime location but once I said that I read a review on Trip Advisor, she changed it right away. I would recommend going there with a check-list:1. King Bed2. Non-Construction Area3. Second FloorEtc....etc.....Do your homework....the reviews on here helped immensely!!Rooms-AWESOME! The bathrooms are great, bed was soft, and living room is nice, flat screen TV was good... (We found ABC...so we were happy)...balcony was really cool...it has a couch type setting out there! We did not have any problems with our air-conditioning! The air won't work if you have the balcony door open. The only issue we had was that our fridge wasn't very cold. So...we just took our trash can and filled it up with ice...it really wasn't a problem.Maid/Service- We tipped a little bit the first two-three days, however, I didn't feel we got anything extra....I understand these people don't make much money...so a little bit can go a long way. We asked for more beer in our room, however, we never got more than 3 a day...I guess it's not that big of a deal. I never felt my stuff was rustled through. Definitely get a safe though...Be aware that on the second to last day our battery died in the safe...so we just carried our stuff on us...Pool/Pool Bar- It was nice...wasn't the best pool I've been to...but it served its purpose. The swim up bar was nice...didn't really use it as much as I thought we would. They have staff (actually 1 guy) around getting your drinks for you...make sure you tip him! He was great....Even came out on the beach to bring us drinks! The last day we were there, they shut down the swim up bar side of the pool. Looks like they were completely resurfacing it! I'd be pissed if I just got there and the swim up bar was closed without notification....but...like I said...do your homework!Food- My husband and I are food snobs...so take this for what it is....Buffett- Got sick of eating at it for lunch...but the quality of food was pretty good. The grilled chicken, guacamole, salsa, chips and cheese were my staple choices. The all you can eat lobster buffets that they do on Friday was soooooo Good! My husband thought the lobster was overcooked...but I liked it!Japanese, La Copula (Gourmet), Mexican and Steak House were all my favorite! It wasn't difficult after 3 pm to reserve additional restaurants. The Mediterranean was ok, skip the Jambalaya...and I heard the Chinese was really good.DO NOT skip the GOURMET!! It was the BEST!Beach- Beautiful...you could walk miles and miles and not be haggled....Shopping area on the beach- Barter! Do not pay more than 70% of what they ask you too...I went from $45 to $15...not much to buy....but to each his own....Overall- I loved this resort. The property alone was worth going to see. There were excursions you could do; however, we just relaxed...Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I'll get pics up soon!

<Content>1st DR Trip My husband and I vacationed here April 28 to May 3. Our impessions:USAirways had direct fights from Philadelphia which was great. The DR government charged us $10 for entering their country which is fine. Funny note: when you pay the $10 they give you a card. You walk 20 ft. to another line and they take it right back. Seemed weird. Van was there to pick us up. No problem. Most roads are bumpy. There's a lot of new road construction going on, but none of them seem to connect to each other yet. Hotel check-in went smoothly.Room was good size and very clean. When we opened our patio curtins there was a beautiful peacock sitting the wall. Quite a welcome. I didn't notice the damp smell except in the sofa cushions when you sat there. I never really noticed it in my clothes while there. However, once we were home and everything had been laundered, I could smell it in all my clothes.Resort is well maintained. Constant grooming going on every day. The buffets and restaurants were always clean and someone was on duty sweeping and wiping during all meals.Buffet offers many different options. Quality was typical buffet standard. We went to the reservation restaurants for dinner more for the service than difference in food. However, the Gourmet restaurant has a great steak and the meal presentation is very nice.Resort staff was very nice. We didn't run into anyone who wasn't friendly. They seem happy in their jobs. I agree with other reviews that it really helps if you can use a few words of Spanish. It is appreciated.The beach is huge. We did have to save chairs in the shade by 8:00AM even though it says it's prohibited. Everyone does. We never had a problem at the pool. Most days the ocean was a little rough. The sand is like powder sugar and very easy to walk on. All the palapas are grouped together. It felt a little claustrophobic for being on a beach. The sun was strong. I normally wear 15-30 SPF, but found I needed the 45 my husband uses.Their social directors were geat. They made sure you knew what was going on, but never pushed if you showed no interest in participating.Warning: all the walkways are very slippery when damp. I saw several people fall. I never wore anything but rubber sandals. Dress code is very laid back. Also, the beach is topless. Many, young and old, Europeans seemed to prefer that.The casino at the neigboring hotel isn't worth the time.I tried to be careful, even brushing my teeth w/bottled water, but I did get Tourista Stomach on the 4th day. After 1-1/2 weeks it still isn't back to normal. My husband claims it was probably the salad I ate a lunch that day. Could be.It was an interesting new experience. I'm not sure I'd go back, but I think my husband would.

<Content>Great Place to Stay I recently returned from my first time trip to the Dominican Republic (Punta Cana) April 25th- May2nd and must say that I had a great time. The Iberostar Bavaro is a 4.5/5 Star Hotel and I must say it was beautiful and clean with a well maintained lobby and common areas. Here are my reviews in a nutshell;Check-in: Was very smooth although there was some confusion with our room reservation. It did get resolved eventually. also upon checkin we were greeted by hotel staff and given a cocktail or frosted drink of some sort and then taken through a brief orientation of what to expect during our stay.Rooms: The room was very nice but had an old 26 inch TV. Not a big deal as we were not there for the tv but it would have been nice to have something decent. Also, you should make sure that you request to have your channels in English in the event you decide to watch tv at night. The beds were very small for double beds (very disappointing) probably more suitable for an adult and child. The comfort level was so so, just comfortable enough to get a good nights rest, but don't expect plush or pillowtop. The room also had a musty smell and feel to it so you may want to bring some fabrezed spray and stick ups. The living room area was nice and cozy with the sofa being very comfortable for sitting but not for sleeping (too rough). The bathroom was beautiful... loved the glassed in shower with marble stoned and the fact that there was a separate bathtub from shower. Room also had in room safe which was an added plus. Oh yes, there is an iron and ironing board.Service/Front Desk: We had a few problems getting help/service from the front desk staff as relates to getting our extra bed that was needed due to the room confusion upon checkin. Even after several calls to the front desk complaining about our sleeping arrangments, it took 3 days to get it resolved. Afterwards, I was able to enjoy a good nights sleep.Food: The Gourmet Restaurants were the best... I recommend 100%. The Buffet was great although the food was pretty much the same each day with slight variations. Just don't overeat, you are liable to get an upset stomach. There is something for everyone and you will never go hungry.Staff: The staff was excellent and very friendly... always helpful and made you feel right at home. I even made a few friends while there and look forward to seeing them on my next visit. TheEntertainment: The entertainment and nightly shows were great! And the 'Star Friends' Team were very funny and entertaining. Should you stay at this hotel, just remember the names Isabel, J.P. and Super Eli. They were absolutely the best and made my stay worthwhile. Beach and Pool: The Pool was superb along with the activities taking place in the area. The beach was beautiful and a sight to see with white sand and warm turquois water. However I didn't like the water in that it was choppy and had strong, boisterous waves which I think may have been a bit much for the kids and seniors... maybe! Overall it was great!Would I go back.... ABSOLUTELY! I would just make sure thatI'm selective on the months in which I travel.Last thing: There were a few days where it was cloudy and even torrential rain storms so be sure to bring an umbrella. Still warm and humid though.

<Content>Great, Relaxing Honeymoon We returned hours ago from our honeymoon vaca to Iberostar Bavaro. We loved it! Wonderful service, wonderful grounds, pool  beach. I would suggest this resort to anyone. The only complaints ...... room service did not arrive one night. When we called on the status, they said they threw away the order because they forgot to ask out room number. No biggie! Also, we called to have them pick up our bags when we were checking out, they never came. (This happened at the Iberostar in Mexico in 2006 as well) Hmmmmm ....... The buffets were plentiful. Food was good. The reservation restaurants were great! French, Cajun, Japanese, Steak House  Mexican. We were there ten days. Just lovely. Quiet  relaxing! Just what we needed after the long 18 months of wedding planning. Nightly entertainment was good. Fun  funny! Spaghetti is awesome! Yes, his name is Spaghetti. Must have something to do with being tall  slender. He was great! Lobby / Theater bar great, quiet  fun. Very enjoyable. Make friends with Salas, Wildon  Hector. Great guys! Ask Hector for the Hector Special They are quite the guys! Always smiling, laughing  dancing! Lovely, lovely time. You will not be disappointed! OH! FYI There are NO clocks in the room. Bring a travel alarm, if needed. They cannot supply you one, but tell you they can give you a wake up call. Day Two ... they never called! We overslept by 3 hours. We used the alarm on our cell phone after that saga. Apple rep very friendly  helpful as well. CarlosGreat vaca for relaxation Very quiet Not a party

<Content>Really nice, but not fantastic We traveled here April 27 - May 4. Our first impression was that it was a nice resort. After being at some 5* and 6*, this is near but definately not at the top. The grounds are definately the most beautiful we have seen. Everything is very well kept and they are always cutting the grass or trimming the trees. The effort shows. Beach: Fantastic fine white sand. The water wasn't the nicest, but we were told that the entire cost is undergoing some strange phenomenon that is making the water less than ideal right now. There is plenty of scenery, if you know what I mean. If you get out there before 10 am or so you should have no problem getting a palapa.Pool: Not great. Big enough, but not very festive. It always seemed a little dirty, and the pool bar isn't very hopping. We were hoping for more pool and poolside activities like other resorts, but there wasn't much of it.Food: After the reviews, we weren't sure what to expect. We were pleasantly suprised. Coming from the Midwest I have had my share of good steaks, so i am a bit picky. The steaks held up nicely. Very tender, and not overly seasoned. I think I had 6 Ribeyes and 2 Fillets on the trip. All were more than acceptable. The Japanese was the best I have ever had. I don't eat fish, but the steak and chicken was fantastic. The Gourmet was good as well, the tenderloin is really good. The Cajun was ok, nothing great. The Steakhouse was good, not great. You should make reservations soon after you get there if you have a group. You can only reserve 3, but daily you can go up to the left of reception between 3-7 and see if there are any openings. Usually they have a bunch at a few restaurants. If you want Mexican or Oriental (at the other Iberostars) you need to reserve more than a day in advance. We tried twice on the same day and they told us the same thing. The Buffet by the pool seems to be better than the one in the lobby, especially for lunch. Alcohol: We expect a few top shelf options, but we were somewhat disappointed. They have Brugal and Barcelo rum, Jim Beam whiskey, el Presidente beer. We ended up taking the bottles of Bohemia from the room fridge and filled a trashcan with ice and beer and headed for the pool. It was ice cold and great, we got a few alright man comments from a few.Rooms: Rooms were acceptable. The bed was comfortable enough and spacious. We were in 1105, it was an ideal spot, close to the pool and lobby. The bathrooms were small, but nice.Make sure you get a safe key, to turn it on, before you leave the front desk, or you will have to make another trip.Grounds: Beautiful. Full of peacocks who aren't afraid to wake you up at any time. Be careful if it is wet. The walk ways are pretty slippery.All in all, it was a great trip and it was our 2nd Iberostar. I would recommend.

<Content>exceeded our expectations! We took a chance with Iberostar Bavaro. For the number of days we stayed there (8 days) it cost us about half of what it usually does in other highly-rated beach properties we had gone to. That the resort got such high ratings in trip advisor got us curious. The other thing was the availabilitly of direct flights and very short travel time to Dominican Republic.As we were being driven to the resort we thought, well we get what we pay for so we psyched ourselves up accordingly. Lo and behold! Iberostar Bavaro was just such a wonderful surprise. The property is extensive, grounds very well-maintained, staff very attentive, food good and drinks overflowing, sand and sea front fantastic! Iberostar Bavaro is one of 3 Iberostar properties in Punta Cana. The other 2 being Iberostar Punta Cana and Iberostar Dominicana. I believe these properties are at different grades though so that Bavaro is the prime property. The 3 are in one mini-city, fully-loaded (with a variety of restaurants, ATMs, a spa, a gym, clay tennis courts, local crafts, boutiques, casino, beach bars, hugh pools, aqua sports) that you don't need to leave the property at all. As guests in Bavaro, we were entitled up to 4 reservations in restaurants of our choice (beware! No walk-in's allowed in the restaurants unlike the buffet halls). We picked Mediterranean, the Steak House, Oriental. Then went again with the Seafood Mediterranean because the fish was just wonderful and the buffet appetizers (stuffed peppers with tuna, fried calamari with marinara sauce, seafood ceviche and salads) were worth a second trip. It was very surprising that for a resort of its size and accessibility, we never felt crowded at any time at all. Even the buffet halls, with its high ceilings, always felt airy. I had horrors of long lines at the buffet, long searches for seats but there were absolutely none the entire time we were there.The resort offered evening entertainment where families and couples could watch and even participate in! They had spoofs (sometimes cheesy), variety shows, games, dancing and singing, some film-showing. The nightly one- hour show ends at about 1030pm. However in the other Iberostar properties next door, there was open-air dancing with a live band. Late party-goers can then have a drink or snack at the buffet hall from 11pm-3am!If I can think of a caveat it will be for light sleepers. Make sure you book a room far enough from where the action is. Our room was in the 1300's, close to the beach pool and was peaceful.My husband and I had the most relaxing vacation and are seriously considering checking out other Iberostar properties next time in the Mediterranean.

<Content>Another Great Week At The Iberostar Bavaro! Went back to the Iberostar for the second year in a row and did not come home disappointed.The beach was clean and beautiful. You could usually get a chair under a palapa if you were out by 9 am. Found that most of the staff were the same from last year which is nice. Did not do any excursions, just hung out at the beach everyday. Had a great time playing bingo with Isabelle everyday at 4.Found the resort to be extremely busy this year which made for a few line ups but no big deal. We went to 3 ala carte restaurants, The Gourmet (fabulous filet mignon), Japanese (one of my few complaints, service from last year has not improved. good food but dreadful service. would not go back). Also went to the seafood restaurant in the Dominicana which was just ok. Buffet food at dinnner was alright. Breakfast at the buffet and lunch at the beach buffet were great. Nightly entertainment was always a hoot and bar service before and during the show was excellent.Weather was fabulous. Only rained the morning we left and just for a couple of hours then the sun shone!Will definitely be back for at least a 3rd visit!

<Content>Excellent Hotel well worth the money I stayed here with my family of five and overall our impression was amazing. I've stayed at quite a few all inclusive resorts and this by far topped them all. The food was well above average for an all inclusive and offered many different selections to please almost anyone. They had the staple foods, as well as native dishes to the island, and even added outdoor barbeque parties during the day which had homemade paella and sangria. The specialty restaurants were okay, the Japanese was the best. Lobby bar was great, staff amazing. Tip a few dollars, and you'll never go without your next drink waiting for you. Pool bar great, with swim up seats. Also, didn't realize until the last day that there are outdoor huts that also serve a good variety of drinks and snacks throughout the day.Rooms were always cleaned very nicely and very spacious. Loved that the bathroom was large and had a separate bath from the shower. Beach was very well kept. Plently of lounge chairs and huts for use. Water was beautiful, be careful of the coral. Suggestion for children, bring water shoes. Staff was amazing, definately made our stay 100%. They recruited for the activities and made everything very fun and exciting. The shows that they performed at night at the lounge were kind of cheesy and outdated, but when they asked for audience participation they got roars of laughter. Definately entertaining. Casino was much smaller than anticipated, and the staff there was very unfriendly.Disco I expected to be a little busier with young people, but since there weren't that many young people on the resort, it was not what I expected. They played decent music and still had a good time dancing. Overall, for all inclusive it was well worth the money. Food, staff, and activities were all amazing and I would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Safe was stolen First, let me start by saying that I would have given this resort an Excellent rating had our safe not gotten Stolen. It was our honey moon and this resort is absolutely beautiful and the staff is wonderful. We booked our vacation through Apple Vacations, nothing special...just knew a lot of people who used them. We stayed in room 2371, close to the pool and one row back from the beach. It was a nice location, but apparently someone had an eye on our room. We checked in on Monday 4/14 and were scheduled to leave on Sunday 4/20. Well, on Saturday 4/19 we left our room at 1:30 to go to eat, swim, and lay on the beach for our last day. We returned to the room at 4:30 and noticed that someone had taken a crowbar and stolen the whole safe out of our room. In our safe was all our money, credit cards, cell phones, jewelry, and PASSPORTS! We immediately contacted the front desk and they were at the room within minutes. We also called our Apple Rep. who was at the resort at the time (Carlos) and he basically said that he spoke with his boss and said it wasn't their problem and that we would have to take it up with the hotel. He never even called to check on us after all this happened to see if we were okay. He was a waste of our time! The hotel immediately took over and made sure we were taken care of. They sat down with us to cancel all our credit cards and cell phones and helped us contact the US Embassy in Santo Domingo to find out what we needed to do about getting new passports. The Embassy informed us that we would not be able to leave as scheduled the next day since we didn't have passports and told us we would have to go to the Embassy to get new ones. So, the hotel scheduled for a security guard (Castro) and a guy from guest servies (James) to drive us 4 hours to Santo Domingo to get new passports on Monday. The ride was really long and extremely bumpy, but we did get to learn a lot about the DR. While we were gone, Katty in guest services worked on our airline tickets to get those transferred so we could leave on Tuesday. In the meantime, between Sat. and Tuesday, the hotel did everything they could to make our stay as pleasant as possible. They took us to the store on the property and told us to get whatever we needed and they also gave us some cash so we could do whatever we wanted. They also scheduled for us to have dinner at the restaurants that require reservations for the next three nights. On Tuesday morning before we left, we met with the director of the hotel and he gave us cash (more than the value of the items in our safe) and a free 7 night vacation to any of their resorts in the Caribbean or Mexico. So, all in all everything turned out just fine and this could have happened to anyone staying at any resort. If you would like details of the Resort:Check in: When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted right away and given a frozen drink while we checked in. They origninally put us in room 1066, which was right beside the construction. We walked to our room and the bellboys brought our bags to our room by golf cart about 5 min. later. The room really wasn't that bad, but I requested a room change because I wanted to be closer to the other two Iberostar resorts (Dominicana and Punta Cana). The next day they moved us to 2371, which was right the middle of everything. Room: The rooms are very spacious, but my only complaint was the extra small bathrooms. The shower was a good size and it has a separate tub, but the toliet area was super small. So small in fact I don't know how a larger person could fit in there. Our A/C worked great and we didn't really have any bad smells like other people have said. We tipped our cleaning lady everyday until our room got broken in to and left her notes as to what we needed. If you can, try to book an upstairs room. Most of the sliding glass doors will pop right open if you lift it up and pull on them. Kind of scary if you are on the bottom floor (like we were) and we think that is how they got into our room to steal our safe.Restaurants: We made our reservations the day we got to the hotel. It is much easier to make them right away so you make sure you get to eat where you want. We were supposed to only have 2 reserved dinners since we were oringinally staying 6 nights. We asked if we could have another one and they had no problem giving it to us. The hotel gave us three extra dinners after everything that happened, so we ate at the restaurants 6 out of 8 nights. We had the Gourmet twice (amazing food...must try the filet), the Japanese twice (definitely a must eat), Mexican was pretty good, and jumbalaya/Cajun was average (they did have a good sirloin though). On one of the nights we didn't have reservations, we ate at Soft Rock Cafe which is like a sports bar and it serves American Fare food. I must say that it was pretty good. The other night we ate at the buffet. It was tropical night and it was terrible. We had a really hard time finding something than even looked appealing. They did have a guy in the corner who would make you a ribeye, which it what we ended up eating. As for food during the day, we usually ate by the pool and there was always a variety of food. You can always find something to eat there. You have to realize that you are in another Country and foods do taste different, so just enjoy being able to experience something different. We heard some people say they had upset stomachs, but it didn't seem to affect us any. Pool: The pool is really big and it has a swim up bar. We spent a lot of our time there. The staff that works at that bar have so much fun singing and dancing the whole time, while having a drink with you. There are a lot of kids in the main part of the pool, but there aren't as many on the bar side of it. Tips: We tipped all the time. The cleaning lady, bartenders, waiters and people at reception who helped us. The resort also has golf carts that will take you anywhere you want to go around the resort. We took them a bunch and we tipped a $1 or $2 every ride. Beach: The beach here is just gorgeous. White sand beach, clear blue water, and a nice breeze to keep you cool. We never really had a problem find beach chairs and we usually layed on the beach near the little snack bar. Usually everyday around 4 or 5 there is a wedding on the wedding right near the snack bar. It's pretty cool to watch. There topless women on the beach. They are pretty much everywhere, laying out, walking down the beach, etc. After you see it a couple of times it's no big deal. Excursion: We booked the Marinarium tour through the Apple Rep at the resort. You board a Catamaran and ride around for about 20 min and they take you to a roped off area in the ocean. You jump off the boat and swim over to the blocked off area that has nurse sharks and stingrays. This was so awesome!! The sharks and stingrays were about 3 or 4 feet below you. Take an underwater camera, you wouldn't want to miss these pictures. It was a great experience and would do it over again in a heartbeat. You snorkel around for about 1 hr. to 1 1/2. Then you get back on the Catamaran and they play music, dance, give you all the drinks you want, and they have sandwiches. You ride for about 30 min and stop at a natural pool where you can get out and swim in waist deep water on a sandbar in the middle of the ocean. It's pretty cool and they play music from the boat and there is a guy in the water serving drinks. It doesn't get much better than that. You stay there for about 30 min. and then get back on the Catamaran and head back. Language: The official language is Spanish, but most people at the resort can speak some English. If you need help with anything, Betty at Reception and Katty and James in Guest services speak very good english and can help you with anything you need.Casino: It's pretty small, but it's enough to get your fix if you want to gamble. Pay attention because the dealers mess up a lot. If you don't know what you are doing or aren't paying attention, they can rip you off. Remember it's called gambling...if it were called winning, everyone would do it. So, don't take more than you are willing to lose. Overall, despite what happened we had a great honeymoon. After the way everything was handled, i must say that I believe we would go back again. Next time, we will keep our stuff on us and not in our safe. I guess the safe isn't so safe.

<Content>Enjoyable but a word of caution! My wife and I have just returned from two great weeks at this resort. We wanted to alert others to the fact that the suites at the IB Bavaro have a sunken livingroom. We arrived very early in the morning and my wife who was not aware of this fell in the dark (only the hall light was on) headlong down the steps onto the livingroom floor. Luckily she was not hurt. However, during our stay we met four or five people who had suffered broken bones by falling in the same manner. I almost fell on my way to the bathroom during the night and from then on used a flashlight kept at my bedside, so take care!Apart from that we enjoyed our stay (including the catamarans) and we would recommend this resort to friends. We previously stayed at the IB Punta Cana  IB Dominicana which are on the same property and now this year at the IB Bavaro. Just take care and you will thoroughly enjoy your visit.

<Content>Would go back in a heart beat Amazing stay! My boyfriend and I returned last night from the Dominican and if I could, I would go back in a heart beat. We decided on the Iberostar Bavaro through commentary on this website and found the reviews to be highly accurate. Hope this helps:Which Iberostar?We had the big decision to make whether to go with the Iberostar Punta Cana, Dominicana, or Bavaro. I'm so glad we went with the Bavaro! Up side, you can go to any of these resorts (they're all right next to eachother) and eat and drink at any of the sites. If you stay at the Punta Cana or Dominica, you don't get the privilege to eat or drink at the Bavaro. Also, the Bavaro has a swim up bar, the other two do not. We were in line with a couple who stayed at the Dominicana at the airport and compared notes. They said there food sucked. Ours, awesome! It was definitely worth the extra $$$ to stay at the Bavaro.FoodBreakfast - There's a huge buffet in the morning. The options are endless and is easy to suit even the pickiest eaters.Lunch - The same area where the breakfast buffet is, you'll find a lunch buffet. There's also a lunch buffet by the pool.Dinner - The Bavaro holds a la carte restaurants - Seafood (Mediterranean), Cajun (Jambalya), French (Gourmet), Japanese (Hirashu), and a steakhouse. For these restaurants, reservations must be made in advance. I advise making them the day you arrive. For 7 days, you get 3 guaranteed reservations. Also, you can check at the hotel services desk between 3 and 7 to check for cancellations for that evening for any of the a la carte restaurants. We went to 4 of the a la carte restaurants - Mediterranean, Jambalaya, Gourmet, and the Steakhouse. They were awesome, but if I could have skipped one, it would have been the steakhouse by personal preference. If you don't go to one of the a la carte restaurants, the buffet is again open and good. On Friday they served grilled lobster, so if there's any night you go to the buffet, save it for Friday. You'll find enough offered to fit anyones needs.Just a note, pack Pepto Bismol and Imodium. Better safe than sorry with all the fruit, alcohol, and traditional foods.BedroomsOur room was nice and big. All accurate and identical to what pictures show on here. I read a review on here telling about the blow dryer and how it resembles a vacuum hose. Very true and I couldn't help but laugh when I saw it, but it does get the job done. There is also kind of a musty smell to the room, but not as bad as I suspected. No need for Lysol as I read on here, but I washed all my clothes once I got back. The beds and pillows were pretty comfortable and again, better than I expected. There's a living room area, a nice sized TV, plenty of lighting, a big closet, and a safe.The bathrooms weren't too small like described on here. The toilet area is small, but the shower and tub are spacious and there is a reasonable amount of room for anyone to move around. Our only issue was our water temperature - our shower water was cold the entire time. We spoke with other couples at our hotel and they had no problems with their water. The front desk told us to leave it running for 10 min to warm up and they'd have someone check on it, but leaving it run didn't work and no one came to repair it. We would have rated it excellent if it weren't for this.Beach/PoolWatch out for the chunks of coral in the water at the beach. We saw a lady walk out limping and others saying they cut the bottom of their feet. We definitely stepped on a few, but no major issues. You can see the bottom through the water, so just keep an eye out while walking. The water at the pool and bar were both perfect temperatures. I read that the pool was cold in other reviews, but that wasn't our case. Also, I read you should put your towels on chairs early in the morning to reserve your seat. If you're a big family, I would recommend getting there early, but if you're a couple, don't bother. We had no trouble finding beach or pool chairs in the sun or shade at any point or time of day. Also, remember to load up on the SPF and re-apply multiple times throughout the day. It's better to bring more than less, because the cost in the gift shop for a bottle is ridiculous. Also, remember aloe or lotion with aloe in it. It helped us a lot. ActivitiesAt both the beach and pool, employees would try to recruit for activities throughout the day - water aerobics, water polo, water volleyball, scuba diving lessons, bingo, beach volleyball, water balloon fights, etc. We opted for the beach volleyball and met some other guests and ended up playing with them more than once during our trip. It was a good way to meet other people. There's also a market on the beach just a short walk from the hotel. Offer only a 1/4 of what their original price. All the shops have similar/identical items and if you don't get the price you want at one shop, don't hesitate to go to the next to compare. It can be a little overwhelming and very high pressured to purchase items at their offering price. I offered $15 for 2 items at one shop and when the owner didn't agree (he asked for $50) I left for the next shop. When I came out he was waiting outside with the items I wanted and he agreed to the $15. There's also a stand right by the gift shop with different travel agencies that offer different trips outside of the hotel. We didn't do any, because there were so many at the hotel. At the pool was the snorkeling class. If you choose to take this, do so in the beginning. They do lessons daily and you can become certified over the course of your vacation. On your last day they take you off shore. We hesitated and missed out on this, so I definitely recommend taking advantage of it. Also there's a spa on the premises and there's a hut on the beach where they do massages. We did a couples massage for an hour and it was reasonably priced. You have to call ahead for the spa or visit the beach hut to schedule a time for your treatment. LanguageWe had no real issues with language differences. Most of the staff spoke some English, but there were quite a few that were fluent. GuestsMostly families with young children and couples, not many singles. About 75% of the guests were age 35 to elderly. Overall, we had an amazing trip and I would go back in a heart beat.

<Content>beauty is only skin deep This was our second visit to the D.R. and to this hotel. Both times with Apple Vacations. They are the best. We went there in 03 and were enamoured with the beauty. It is truly a beautiful hotel and beach. The beach goes on as far as you want. You don't get bothered by the local merchants hustling thier wares which is nice. You can take a 20 minute walk and there are the usual array of carvings, tee shirts, booze, cigars etc. Be prepared to bargin,,, a lot. They start real high so don't be afraid to work on it. There is a stone unique to the D.R. and it is Lairimar. A soft blue stone and very pretty. The local jeweler is Harrison's and they have very nice items.The gang up the beach also has it but it is just a little less..ummm, refined. Price makes a difference. I am also a rum nut and you can get the Barcelo Imperial Rum at the lobby bar but nowhere else unless you buy it from the beach vendors or in the hotel store for about $30 per bottle which is what I did. At the pool we would give them our insulated glasses with some rum in them and they would mix our pleasure. We also took a cheap insulated 6 pk. cooler with ice in it to the beach. What can I say, it's a long walk to the lobby bar. The staff was great and the food was greater. Abreu at the lobby bar never missed his cue and we took good care of him as well. Juan in the buffet dining room was just impecable. This time as well as 3 yrs. ago. We also took good care of him. Please tip these people, they work thier butts off for you. They know that we Americans will tip them for good service unlike many of our European Counterparts who don't share this custom. Also there is a lot of line cutting in the buffets. Don't got too bent out of shape. Rise above it. Your from the USA, set the example, please. Now to the actual room. We will not go back again. They stink. Some worse than others yes. 3 yrs. ago our room was horrible, We were told the 2nd floor was better and it was...I think. But it stunk with mildew. We stunk when we got back, our clothes stunk, and our luggage still stinks. We did the Fabreeze and the mildew rocks from Home Depot while there but...no help, We got there and our AC was not working well, They fixed it right away and the room was nice and cool and I am a real pain when it comes to AC. But once again all rooms are not the same so good luck with that. Here's my problem. On my last night there our AC started to poop out. It caused water to leak on to the foyer floors outside the bath room. We thought okay, last night, put towels down and deal with it. I happened to get dehydrated (don't ask me how all my rum had ice) and was rather sick. I got up for a visit to the bathroom at 4:30 AM. Much more water had accumulated than what we saw earlier and I hit the tile floor and took a major fall. I basically did the splits. 56 yr old man here....not good. The right knee I just finished therapy on from surgery was wacked and my left knee swelled like a balloon. Upon calling the desk looking for ice they said to go to the ice shack down the lane. I didn't want my wife to have to go out that late but they REFUSED to help. So she went and it was locked. GRRR. She called the desk and I spoke with them. I was told that I was on my own. No Help No Nothing. VERY RUDE, VERY BRIEF. The next day my Apple Rep told me a doctor was on call 24/7. Trust me I would have gladly seen a doctor but I was never informed by the front desk. So in conclusion (Sorry for the rant ) it's a great place if all goes well. But if you need help you are on your own. Those terms are not acceptable to me and we will find a nice place in the Keys next year and keep our $$ in the U.S. God Bless and safe travels.

<Content>Bad Service From Front Desk My family and I stayed here for our fourth iberostar trip. The first three trips being in mexico. This resort was just ok.GROUNDS very nice and clean FOOD slightly below average, but the wait staff is wonderfulFRONT DESK TERRIBLE our air conditioner was not working the entire week,we called the front desk three times, the first two times they sent t two people to fix the probelm. We were then told two times the air conditioner was fixed, but it still didn't work. It was extremely uncomfortable since it was very hot  humid in our room. It was especially difficult for our two asthmatic children, that were having dificulty breathing, even with their medication. The third time we called the receptionist they said would fix the problemelm again and this time no one even came to fix this problem I asked for a manager to call back that night and a call was never returned.CHECK OUT our bus was suppose to pick us up at 5:45pm. Our checkout was at 12pm. We asked the fron desk if we could check out later in the afternoon since our children had asthma issues. The front desk told us we can check out at 1pm because the resort was full, which is hard for me to believe because our luggage was sitting outside the room till 4:30pm and the resort didn't seem full at all.While waiting for the bus we asked the front desk if they can put us in any air conditioned room after them seing our three year old coughing from asthma and they told us their was no place they can put us as they didn't even seem to care at all. We spent hours in the resort's public bathroom trying to keep our children cool. We will never stay at this resort again as we are still shocked on how the front desk treated us. This is by far no a 5 star resort.

<Content>A Fantastic Babymoon! We're expecting Baby #2 in September and chose IBB for our Babymoon Getaway destination (4/7-4/11). Great choice! A few highlights (I'll try to keep each section brief...)1) Palapa-roof airport (so tropical!) Greeted with a live musical trio. Paid $10 per person entry fee. Customs was a breeze.2) A 30- minute ride from the airport in air conditioned comfort (VIP Travel Services) on well-maintained roads. 3) Check-in was effortless! We were immediately upgraded to a beautiful room just a very short walk from the beach/pool.4) Our room (#2382) was very nice: air-conditioning worked well, no musty odor, clean linens, good housekeeping with fresh towels (if we wanted) daily. Comfy garden patio with the occasional visiting peacock. We left in the a.m. to spend the day on the beach and returned in the p.m. to find a brand new 32 LCD flat screen TV!! Fabulous 2-person marble shower, a bathtub  spacious vanity w/huge mirror. Stocked mini-bar. The safe is free so we used it. (just don't lose the key...)5) Grounds: ABSOLUTELY gorgeous and superbly maintained! Almost no bugs (mosquitos, etc.) Staff members always sweeping, cleaning, even common-area baths are immaculate. Gazebos, covered bridges, ponds with pink flamingos, peacocks showing off for the guests. Perfect!6) Pool: beautiful. Lots of chaise lounges.7) Beach: UNBELIEVABLE!! The most beautiful we''ve ever seen. White powdery sand, crystal-clear waters, some seaweed but the staff raked every morning. Lots of palapas in the shade. Note: some topless sunbathing. The sun is intense so wear sunscreen!8) Staff: super friendly  helpful. Their mission was to make us as comfortable  happy as possible.9) Food  drink: Not gourmet but good. The breakfast buffet is huge! Omelets to order, smoked salmon, local dishes, something for everyone. Loved the fresh fruit  juice bars. Make your dinner reservations in the a.m. We had no trouble at all with reservations. Try the seafood paella at the Mediterranean restaurant. I enjoyed virgin cocktails all week but my hubby enjoyed all of his cocktails. Our favorites were the Lobby Bar and the beachside bar at the Dominicana (the sister hotel next door ~ just a short walk away)10) Special hello to: Francy at the Ice Cream stand, Speghetti the comedian  Lucy for a fantastic massage! We'll see you next year...with the kids!! (Although our son wasn't with us on this trip, we noted that the resort is family-friendly)Note: I see why Budget Travel magazine rated this resort Best Value...you get a nice bang for your buck! If you go, Enjoy!

<Author>JBB2007
<Content>Overall, had a great time I've been using TripAdvisor for years. And shame on me for this being the first review I write. As I relied so heavily on this site for my vacation, I want to pay back to all of you out there who are thinking of booking the Iberostar Bavaro. We had a really good time. I travelled with my husband, infant son (8 months), my sister in law and two kids (13 4). It was our first time to Punta Cana - but I've stayed at several all inclusive resorts in Jamaica, Mexico and the Bahamas. When you first enter the resort, its really beautiful. Upon check-in they run over to you with a cold drink, which is just so refreshing. Our rooms were already ready (we were there at around 12, so before check-in time) and we headed over. We stayed in room 1115. Very nice room, exactly what I thought it would look like as I'd seen pictures. Very damp feel, as you may have read on other reviews. Even clothes that we didn't wear on the vacation we had to wash when we got home. The porch was great, especially since we were travelling with a baby and had to be more in our rooms for naps and early bed times. The bed wasn't very comfortable but that seems similar to other reviews I've read about hotels in Punta Cana. If you are a light sleeper, which I am, make sure to ask for a room in the back of the resort, closer to the pool. Our room was too close to the lobby area and the nightly entertainment was very very loud and I had a hard time going to sleep. Pool and beach were amazing. You'll never have a hard time finding a lounge chair - whether it be in the shade or the sun. The little huts on the beach are even easy to come by if you aren't picky on where you sit. There is a great breeze down by the beach and I can't imagine it not being there as its hot hot hot! The pool area and grounds are very well kept and you'll see people cleaning constantly. The restrooms by the beach and pool are very clean and tidy. If you hang out on the beach you will see quite a few topless women. Not 'normal' for us Americans but so not a big deal and you get used to it right away. I can only classify the food as fair. We ate at the main buffet, buffet by the pool, the Mexican restaurant and the Japanese restaurant. First let me say that the breakfast is amazing at the buffet. All the fresh juices, eggs, pancakes and waffles made fresh to order. The fruit was as fresh as can be. Hands down the best meal for me. The lunch and dinner just seemed to get repetitive but I think thats no matter where you go. The a la carte restaurants really weren't that great. The Mexican restaurant served all the same food that you see every day at the snack bar at the pool. Japanese was pretty good although dessert left alot to be desired so we just hit the buffet dessert after. I'm not much of a drinker but I love the girlie frozen drinks like Pina Coladas and Strawberry daiquiris while on vacation. Unfortunately, they had those machines for these drinks and they were totally awful. You can get a 'real' frozen drink at the lobby bar and you can get real frozen drinks at the other bars as long as they don't have a fake one in the machine. My husband and I both had massages while we were there and it was fabulous! In comparison to other places, this was crazy cheap (only $50 for almost an hour) and it was really good. They have huts along the beach for massages but I felt more comfortable having it done at the actual spa. The spa is pretty nice, can't say its 5 * by any means though. I hit the gym one of the days but it wasn't worth it - just walking or running the beach is much nicer. There are a few ellipticals and a few treadmills for cardio and they are on the older side. If you walk over to the two other sister resorts, you'll be glad you stayed at the Bavaro. The Bavaro is just so much nicer, cleaner and prettier than the other two. Tips do go a long way and I think they are expected in some instances. You got better bar service and earlier maid service if you left a tip. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning. Beware when you head back to the airport!!!! Not at all related to the hotel but worth mentioning. If you are taking a van/car/bus service, provided by your travel agent, to the hotel, your luggage will be picked up by porters before you can even get out of the bus. In fact, we were made to stay on the bus until the porters had the luggage out. They will walk you over to the lines with your luggage (all of maybe 30 feet!) and stand on top of you asking for a tip. Too in your face for something we didn't even ask for. Overall I'd really recommend going to the Iberostar Bavaro!

<Content>Beach was Great, the Resort was just OK. Our problems with Iberostar Bavaro came the first night we checked in. I planned a trip to the Dominican Republic for my husband's 30th birthday. When we got to our room we noticed that we were in a room with two single beds (even though I had specifically booked a king) and the window in our room faced a loud construction site. When I tried to change the room (I told them I had booked a king since we are married) they told me they had no other rooms but that they could switch us the next day. Since they screwed up on my reservation I asked that they give my husband a birthday cake in our room (for my husband) as a small compensation to which a man named Rafael at the front desk shook his head and promised exemplary service but no cake. Honestly I thought a cake was the least they could do since they screwed everything up. Oh, and our bags arrived at our room 45 minutes after we got to the room, we might as well have carried them ourselves! The bell boys told us Sorry and waited for a tip that they didn't get. The next day we switched rooms and there was no exemplary service as promised, just a room with a king and a better view of a walkway. Is customer satisfaction no longer a big deal for hotels? I mean, seriously, they didn't give a crap that they screwed up our reservation. Anyways, the resort is nice enough, the beach is amazing. The room smelled musty though and my husband got some sort of food sickness on the last day of our trip (something that he said was brewing for a few days on account of the food. It wasn't great). All of the people who worked at the front desk of this resort were so unhelpful - when you asked a question you'd often get a blank stare. And the questions we asked were easy - like, where is the cajun restuarant? When we booked a dinner reservation via the concierge they were so unfriendly and forgot to mention that men have to wear pants to dinner, so, of course, my husband had to run back to the room to change when we showed up for dinner. I stayed at the Riu Palace in Mexico a few years ago and we had a great time and the experience was SO different. As I was sitting on the beach at Iberostar Bavaro I was wishing I had booked the Riu for this trip; I've learned to stick with what you know and like.

<Content>Lived Up to Our Expectations.....Manage yours.... Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. April 5-10. This is our second trip to Punta Cana. We absolutly loved it. Weather was perfect during the day some sprinkles at night. I'll approch this review a liitle different. I managed my expectations before the trip....and the Iberostar crew over delivered. Beach- One of the finest I have ever seen. Absolutely fantastic. The Iberostar team keep it groomed and clean. Europeans out number USA folks 3 to 1 so remember tons of women are topless and men in thongs. Overall beach rating A+. This is why you come to Punta Cana...#1 reasonFacility- This is a beautiful, clean, well maintained property. Service is as good as you can expect in a 3rd world country. What they lack in knowledge or skill they more than make up for in effort and positive attitude. A+ for a clean room, fast prompt responses.Food- This is an all inclusive resort, food is going to be average at best....and it was. That being said I found good things to eat at every meal. Acceptable Pizza, burgers at the beach/pool restaurant. Steaks at dinner are the qualty of a Ponderosa or Ryans.....acceptable. Great fresh fruit. Overall food C+. Just keep in mind....you don't come for the food and you will not be dissappointed.Medical Facilities- The have a 24 hour Dr on premise. They have a pharmacy. Wife needed some Phx stuff......cash only.Casino- Don't do it. There are no laws governing the gambling like in Las Vegas. They will deal off the bottom of the deck, clear winning bets etc. Go to the beach.Things I have read in reviews that I disagree with - The food is only average. If you like cruise buffets....this is a step down.If you have an issue with things being not like the good ol USA(food  language).... don't go.....this is a spanish speaking 3rd world country. We (USA) are not the primary customers. Euro's out number USA 3 to 1. Iberostar is a company based in Spain. They cater well to their customers.Regarding tips..... I tipped because of the effort they put in, outstanding.... did it improve service.... no. They worked hard regardless. They were appreciative of all tips. The only people who solicited tips were the airport transfer folks.Things to make sure you bring/plan for....Take an umbrella....if it rains you can get trapped in your room. You will want it to get to the restaurants.Take more sun screen than you think you will need. You can buy it there but it will be 50% more than a well planned trip to Wal-Mart. We left the hotel 3 hours before our flight....we barely made it through checkin and security. Plan plenty of time for all of this. This was a great trip and a great facility. Wife and I are already planning our return

<Content>Very ill from Salmonella - Iberostar Bavaro Traveled to Iberostar Bavaro March 1 - March 8, 2008 with 9 people in our party including 5 children. First I will say that it was a beautiful hotel and grounds - beach was lovely and the food was good - or at least I thought -until the Friday before I came home I became very very sick. We left on the Saturday and the plane ride home was awful! Once home I received medical attention and shortly after I received word from our Public Health Department that I had contacted Salmonella - I was interviewed and the only - ONLY - food I ate was at Iberostar. I was also the only one in my party to get sick. I only started to feel better a month later. The part that makes me most concerned is the lack of interest in the part of Iberostar. I have emailed the Hotel and even phoned but no one has called/emailed back . They just do not seem to care - which makes me think that it is not important to them - although they seem to care very much when we were there. I am not worried so much about myself - but if one of my children got this sick I would be very very worried and mad.

<Content>Fabulous! We booked a trip from 3/28/08 thru 4/4/08. We had a chartered flight which arrived on time, and we were at the hotel very quickly. The resort was Fabulous. We were lucky enough to get a room overlooking the pool. Everything was in close proximity, the room was always clean, the food was terrific, and the people were very pleasant. We plan to go back very soon. I would encourage anyone that wants a nice relaxing vacation to stay at Iberostar Bavaro.

<Content>Best Trip ever for the family! I booked the vacation through Continental vacations as they were running a 10% off the hotel promotion. 11 of us went (6 kids, 5 adults in 5 rooms to include my mother and two sisters and family). The kids were 10, 11, 13, 15 16 and 16. We left Newark on Easter Sunday and found no wait what so ever in the airport. I was surprised with the $10 per person 鈥渆ntry tax鈥? My mother was in a wheelchair so they took us to the side of the line and made me give them $110 for 11 tickets, which they took away from me 10 feet later. I thought this was a scam but found out later that it wasn鈥檛. We had no issues in getting our luggage and through customs. We took a small bus with 4 other people to the resort. We arrived around 4pm and had a small issue checking in because Continental did not provide me with a hardcopy voucher for the resort. All I had was the confirmation e-mails. The staff was nice about it and made copies of the e-mails. We had 5 rooms and one of my sisters had called ahead to make sure that we were all in the same building and close to main walkway so facilitate my mom鈥檚 stay. The rooms were exactly as we had asked for, great location in the resort and in great shape. The only issue was the peacocks. 15 plus of these creatures nested outside my one sister and brother-in-laws room. They made so much noise that after the 1st day we had to request to change buildings. We were in rooms 1051-1056. The hotel staff moved us towards the pool and away from the peacocks. The new set of rooms 2041-2046 had issues with the showers leaking on the floors and a mold smell. For me it was no problem. My mom was concerned, the kids didn鈥檛 care.The rooms were beautiful. King size beds, sofa, mini bars, balconies, etc鈥?It was wonderful! We had read about tipping the maids a few dollars each day and they kept our rooms in good shape and the min bars stocked with extra water. The rooms also had T.V.s, safes, hairdryers, and telephones. We stayed for 9 days and 8 nights. I was concerned before we left about the buffet food and getting tired of it. The food was outstanding. The buffet for breakfast consisted of omelet stations, fresh juice bar, fresh fruit, homemade donuts, all types of pastries, breads, cheeses, meets, cereals, yogurts, waffles, pancakes, French toast and my favorite a chocolate croissant and more. With 5 adults and 6 kids, nobody went hungry, ever. Lunch was by the pool area and I always steered towards the fresh BBQ. They had steak one day, chicken another, ribs another, paella with lobsters another and so on. We went to 4 of the specialty restaurants. The gourmet was delicious, Japanese great, steakhouse good and I could have skipped the Cajun. (Not very Cajun tasting). My kids used the room service several times after the beach ordering pizzas and chicken fingers and fruit. This worked out very well for us. They came back from the beach and had a 鈥渟nack鈥?and then we went to dinner later. The buffet for dinner was stupendous. Fresh fish, steaks, all you could possibly eat and I did for a few days. I have to mention a special accolade for the fresh fruit. There was plenty of it for all the meals and it was delicious. The 鈥淎nimation鈥?staff - Henry, Super Eli, Spaghetti, Juan Paul and others did a great job. We participated in the archery, BB Gun, Bocci ball, horseshoes, water polo and bingo tournaments on a daily basis. Those guys and gals worked hard all day and then put on the nightly shows. The shows were OK. They were corny at times, but entertaining. The was a professional show one night we were there. The shows consisted mostly of audience participation events and at times were hilarious. One of us would get up each morning about 7 am and go down to the beach to get us 11 lounges and 3 palapas. We never had any problem getting them at that time. The beach and ocean were outstanding. The beach was big with lots of white sand. There was a storm a few days before we arrived and the surf was cloudy at times. We went tubing and snorkeling by paying extra money. We brought our snorkeling gear which is a must. We paid an extra $30 per person to be taken out to a coral reef and it was worth it. You can snorkel right from the beach, but will not see the same type of tropical fish. You need to make sure you bring plenty of sunscreen. The sun is strong!We shopped at both the merchants at the resort and also down the beach. There was some nice jewelry available. Make sure you negotiate. We also has our family (11 of us) photographed by the resorts鈥?photographer. The photographer takes pictures of the guests with monkeys, birds, reptiles etc,, daily. The resort charges $8 per photo developed. The photographer must have taken over 100 photos of us in different family groups, mother, father, sister, brother, family, kids, cousins, etc鈥?We purchased about 30 of them and then I paid the photographer $30 on the side for a CD which had all the photographs. We never used the facilities at the Iberostar Punta Cana/Dominicana. We saw the pool which is smaller and more crowded than the Bavaro鈥檚. Defiantly pay the extra money to stay at the Bavaro. The Punta Cana/Dominicana seemed more hotelish in style. The grounds between the Punta Cana/Dominicana held a rose garden maze. It just seemed more crowded on the beach and at the pool at the Punta Cana/Dominicana. The trip back from the Bavaro was on a large bus. No issues. The lines were long to check in at the airport, because they hand search each bag. No issues at customs. The flight back was good.We have travelled to Jamaica twice, Nassau and now to Dominican Republic. I would rate the Iberostar Bavaro as the best of the resorts that we have been to. I would absolutely stay at this resort again or another Iberostar property.

<Content>We had a blast! We traveled in a group of 4 couples- all married. We had a wonderful time. We can get pretty crazy, and the staff didn't seem to mind and enjoyed us as much as we enjoyed them. Everyone was very friendly. Francis was our Apple Rep- GREAT guy to work with.The resort is just breath taking. By far the most beautiful resort we have stayed at yet. Flamingos and peakocks everywhere, and pretty tame. The beach is gorgeous. The marketplace is just down the beach- pretty expensive. You can get a better deal in the gift shop on some items.My husband and I have been to Sandals in Jamiaca and also a Breezes resort in the Bahamas. We still favor Sandals, but this resort was very nice. The food was pretty good. We all had issues with tummy problems. We called it our colon cleansing vacation, but no one was ever sick enough to spoil anything. We just came prepared with OTC medication. I was sick one day, but I think it was from body surfing in ocean. The waves were pretty strong and I felt seasick all day after that. You do have to get an early start if you want reservations at the specialty resturants. But we planned ahead and everyone took turns making reservations. No biggie at all. On Wednesday there was an all you can eat Lobster buffet. YUCK! The lobster was either burned or undercooked. Several people were very ill the next day (none of us). I would pass on that- otherwise the buffet it pretty good too.This resort is HUGE and you can go to the other two neighboring Iberostar resorts. The disco is over there and worth the walk. We stayed there pretty late and had a ball. I did get a massage on the beach. My massuse was 30 minutes late and they still charged me for an hour massage. I had to complain to about 4 people before they refunded that money.One downfall was the frozen drinks are mostly in dispensers and are not frozen because it is so hot. In Jamaica, all our drinks were made to order with fresh fruit. I was not a big fan of the beer and the rum drinks get old after a while. But we managed to find something.As for the tours, we went on the Carribean Festival- that was fun. We also did Bavarro Runners. Migel was our guide. He was awesome. We brought a bunch of baseball caps to pass out to the kids along the way. Well worth it- we felt like Santa.There is a lot of Europeans and a lot of topless women. Our husbands did not seem to mind. :-) The rooms were nice. There is a musty smell that sticks with you. I brought air fresheners and dryer sheets- did not seem to help. My suitcase still smells (a year later). It just brings back memories of our trip. We did tip the maid and our room was always stocked and clean. Flowers everywhere.CAUTION... DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT CARD TO CALL THE US!. We forgot to bring a calling card and made the mistake of calling home using a credit card. I made 3 calls, but they charged my credit card for 7 calls (over $300). Took a while to get that cleared up.

<Content>All You Ever Needed to Know, Plus Another 1000 Words. We have just returned from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro which we decided on largely based on reading millions of TripAdvisor reviews. So here is one more review for those who it might help!Background and Overall:We traveled with our two kids (baby and age 4) and another family with similar aged kids and a set of grandparents. Our trip was March 30-April 5. We found the best price on beachdestinations.com. We tend towards vacations at 5-star resorts but didn鈥檛 want to spend that kind of money bringing kids with us. There are no 5-star resorts in the Dominican Republic, they are very high on value but they aren鈥檛 the Four Seasons. This resort deserves 5 stars in TripAdvisor because it鈥檚 an incredible value for the money. It鈥檚 probably a 3.5 to 4 star resort in a conventional rating system, which is pretty good considering we paid around $300/night for our family whereas we average around $1000/night (with food etc. ) when we stay at the Ritz or similar. In our experience traveling with kids, you don鈥檛 really get a chance to sink back and appreciate luxury, so you might as well aim for a good value.Airport and Check In/Out:I had read the Punta Cana airport was rustic. I thought it was actually nice. It was partially open-air and had a Tahitian feel to it, but it was clean and attractive with a lot of natural stone and marble. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon, paid our $10/person entry fee and found our transfer (Dominican Airport Transfers- $80 round trip private transfer, very happy with our decision on this) and arrived at the hotel in about 30-35 minutes. There were no lines, we walked right up and got our room (and frozen cocktail). Very easy. On the check out (Saturday afternoon), I had to wait for one other person to check out. The bag delivery took about an hour from the room but otherwise was an easy checkout. The departure from the airport was a little more chaotic, bag handler鈥檚 swarm the van when you pull in and the check in lines can be very, very long. However, our bag handlers worked the situation for us (probably not wanting to have to stand in line with us for an hour!) and we were cut in front of probably 100 or more other people to check in. With two small kids in tow and a ton of luggage, we tipped them heavily. I鈥檇 recommend arriving a minimum of two hours in advance of your flight and probably more as there was an accident on the highway which made our transfer a little late. You never know and there is a lot of confusion at the airport until you get past security. I had read there was only pizza at the airport but in fact there was also Wendys, pastry shops, bars, etc. We didn鈥檛 eat anything at airport.Iberostar Bavaro Rooms:I emailed a week in advance (reservaspuj@iberostar.com.do) and made room requests. I asked for a renovated beachfront room or a room in building 132 which I had seen was next to the beach and pool. We got 1321, which we were happy with (each building has 8 suites numbered 1-8 after the building number). The rooms are large with a drop down living room, two couches that can convert into beds and a large balcony with another couch. Our room faced gardens with no walkways or other rooms, so it was nice. The ceilings are high so the first floor is a must-have if you have strollers as the second story rooms have two flights of stairs. I鈥檓 sure they are a little more private, but with kids 1st floor is the place to be. Our major complaint with the rooms were the beds were hard and the sheets not particularly soft. The bathroom is a little small but workable with marble and stone. It also had a hair dryer that sort of resembled a vacuum hose, but worked ok, and there was conditioner, shampoo, lotion and soap provided. The floors of the room are marble and are very slippery when wet. There is a coffee maker in the room, TV (no DVD), no clock (bring one), a safe, a minibar (drinks only) and very large sliding glass doors to balcony. There are blackout shades which are very effective and a ceiling fan. I had heard of musty smells and to bring dryer sheets, we did not experience that. US appliances worked with no issues. We got a wooden crib. It was a little slanted and it wasn鈥檛 new. But it worked ok. I may have been alarmed if it was my first baby where everything not 100 percent perfect alarmed me, but I don鈥檛 think it was at all unsafe. If you are nervous on these things, bring your pack and play.The rooms were cleaned daily by the chambermaids. Ours did a great job, our friends were not as happy with theirs. Everyone wants to know the beachfront rooms and so the building are these: 128,129,130,131,233,234,235,236 (Maybe also 392, 393, 394- not sure if these are part of Bavaro or not.) The beachfront are nice, however, there are walkways in front of them for beach access so you will have some foot traffic nearby, moreso on the side that connects to the Punta Cana and Dominican hotels. Also the first floors can鈥檛 really see much of the ocean because of some slight dunes except for building 131. I would avoid the rooms close to the lobby in the front of the resort as it felt they were quite far from the pool (5 minute walk vs. our 5 second walk) unless you really want to be near the casino, disco, etc.. There is construction next door and I never heard and thing even when walking next to it. Maybe they are building it with glue. It was totally silent.We saw no signs of the rum and fruit others mentioned. Food:Overall the food was good, some things great some ok. We ate mostly at the buffet in the lobby for breakfast (fresh donuts, mango excellent) and dinner (fish always excellent) and the pool restaurant for lunch. It feels like we were constantly eating. I had read to bring snacks for the room but I cannot imagine it鈥檚 possible to need more food than is provided everywhere. We liked the self-paced buffet but also ate at the Japanese Steakhouse (excellent) and the Gourmet Restaurant (ok- beef was excellent). We canceled our reservation at the Steakhouse because we couldn鈥檛 get the kids organized in time. You get 3 a la carte reservations for a week stay and men need to wear long pants. Their reservation system is a little rickety so book as early as you know you want to go. You may find open seats if you check in individually after 8pm (I think they allow you to do that) since they insist you have this little ticket and present it personally to cancel, I think of lot of people don鈥檛 bother and the wait list never gets called.We had occasional upset stomachs. I took Pepto caplets all the time trying to ward it off. My four year old complained of tummy aches constantly so he got Childrens Pepto daily too, but it鈥檚 hard to tell if it鈥檚 the food or just a result of eating and drinking so much. It wasn鈥檛 anything serious, but we all had our moments of bellyaches, except the baby who doesn鈥檛 eat table food.Tipping:I suppose it鈥檚 possible to go the week and not spend virtually any cash, but I鈥檇 recommend bringing about 50-100 singles for tipping. We always left a few dollars at the table after each meal, a few to the maid, here and there to bartenders, etc. We left larger tips $5-10/per adult at the al la carte restaurants. I get that it鈥檚 an all-inclusive, but this is a poor country and the people need the extra money. It doesn鈥檛 impact service; they aren鈥檛 going to risk losing what may be some of the few jobs on the island by not doing their best always, but we were a little surprised to see how few people tipped, seemingly mostly Americans tipped. We also tipped bell hops, room service, baggage handlers, transfer drivers, etc. I think we went through $350-400 in tips all together. Well worth it, the vacation was still extremely cheap for what you get.Casino:When you go to the Casino, consider any money in your pocket about to be donated to the resort. They tend to not quite follow their posted rules for card games, unless it suited them and the slot machines are a little shady with the ability to switch denominations mid game. I鈥檓 sure there is zero regulation. Still, it was fun to spend a few bucks in the teeny tiny casino. It鈥檚 very smoky though. There are carts that run you around to the casino or disco at night if you want (they call them 鈥渢axis鈥? but it鈥檚 generally not more than a 10 minute walk anywhere so I found them mostly unnecessary.Facilities and Grounds:The grounds are kept exceptionally clean. There are various convenience stores and markets on property and nearby. Prices ranged from really reasonable (cheap Gatorade) to laughable ($50 dollars for an inflatable beach ball our friends negotiated down to $5- we had brought the same one from Target鈥檚 dollar bin). I tried the spa, very cheap but a little chaotic, not very elegant. You get what you pay for. They have a ton of activities going on, we did some, they were fun. Shows each night, mostly we sat around and had cocktails in the vicinity without paying attention so I don鈥檛 know if the shows were good or not. They drew a crowd though.The grounds were lovely. Free roaming peacocks and other birds. One complaint is most walkways were stamped concrete to resembled cobblestone which looked nice but was difficult to walk in heels and also very slippery when wet.We were very worried about mosquitoes and brought gallons of Deet but we didn鈥檛 see any so in the end we didn鈥檛 use any of the bug spray. Our friend鈥檚 mother got several bites in her room the first night but not again after that.People:The staff was very nice, sweet with the kids, some spoke a little less English than expected. We hired a babysitter one night on short notice (Ava, supervisor of housekeeping) she was good, not much English though. The service again isn鈥檛 Four Seasons where they seem to read your mind, but it was competent and friendly.Now, some of the other guests were a different story. At the Bavaro, they were mostly ok, but we found some guests inconsiderate and rude. They swore around children, banged chairs or sat down and lit cigarettes next to sleeping babies, kicked peacocks and other wildlife. It was a little shocking. It was much worse at the Punta Cana and Dominican hotel side, which we walked through a few times a day just cruising around. I hate to stereotype but they seemed to be mostly the Europeans. I guess when you go to a 鈥渧alue鈥?hotel; you can run into some less refined behavior. However, we also met some other really nice people, so it was mixed.The average age around Bavaro was probably 40鈥檚. We expected a lot of kids, and there were very few actually.Pool:Frigid. Freezing. Ice bath. I don鈥檛 know how they got it so cold. The weather our week was beautiful, one day of rain, but mostly nice weather and very little humidity so maybe it didn鈥檛 get hot enough to want to jump into pool that cold but it was painfully cold and was a disappointment because of it. The last day we were there was markedly hotter and I had heard that perhaps that weather was more typical. The pool does have a nice beach-like gradual entrance, which was great for the kids but slippery, we saw several falls. Bring floats or toys, they are allowed and fun for the kids. Chair reservations start early 鈥?around 6 or 7. However, the Bavaro is such that we never felt like it was crowded. We felt like we owned the place during the week, though they said it was at full capacity. There were always chairs available, but since we were a party of 10 we wanted multiple palapa鈥檚 together so we put towels out in the morning. It was a more crowded on the weekends.Beach:Beautiful but a wind tunnel, no idea if that is normal or not, but incredibly windy. Tons of available palapa and chairs when we ventured out, usually early in morning or later in afternoon. Beach-bars on either side. Water was warmer than pool but too rough for kids. Really pretty beach though, one of the nicest I鈥檝e seen. The water, horizon and sand colors are gorgeous, but the water is not translucent due to the churn. We spent very little time out there because it was too windy for the kids. As for the topless discussion, not so much at Bavaro but we saw some walking on the beach from other hotels or from the Punta Cana or Dominican side. Maybe 10 total. I鈥檓 still nursing a baby so my four year old didn鈥檛 even notice, but I will say it鈥檚 a little odd to see a full-chested woman playing volleyball with her kids topless in public. I鈥檓 not sure of what the attraction is, seemed painful to me, but it didn鈥檛 bother us. We were probably more scarred by the speedos and tiny bikinis on people who had no business wearing them. Topless is not allowed at the pools.Miscellaneous:Brought the famed bubba kegs (20oz). Used them daily for coffee and every so often at the pool. They are nice to have, saved some walking , but we wouldn鈥檛 imbibe as much as desired given the kids. We saw a few others with them. I think the 20oz is plenty big. Other helpful things were brought- extended sunshade for the kids, small flashlight, compact umbrella, DVD player for kids, laundry detergent (used a lot), dish soap (used a lot- baby bottles, sippy cups, bubba kegs), band-aids and misc medications, aloe, stroller with decent sized wheels for bumpy terrain and a waterproof watch. You may need a nightlight or you can rig the closet doors to provide some light. We also got some use out of our Spanish dictionary (writing notes to maids) and small walki- talkies (used with babysitter). The deep sea fishing excursion the boy were going to do was cancelled due to rough seas but our friends took the kids to the manatee park or whatever it is- they were not too impressed with that, no shade and not much to see.I also walked down the beach to the Bahia Principe which we had considered and found it pretty but very crowded with a younger clientele 鈥?maybe 20鈥檚 and early 30鈥檚 and less conducive to small kids given the crowds. I also walked by the RUI which looked nice, but you can only tell so much from the beach. The Iberostar Bavaro beach set up was better than either of these with more room, better chairs, etc. Overall, it was a good trip in spite of the work involved with traveling with young children. I would definitely recommend the Iberostar Bavaro. It was our friends parents 16th trip to the DR an they said this resort was the best they stayed at.

<Content>Our Perspective First off we found this very useful prior to our trip and are glad to leave our perspective. We will only touch the points in which we differ from the majority.Food; We are foodies so it takes alot to impress us, and we would give this a 7 out of 10. FYI: The property next door has better beach lunches/parties. The gourmet was a 6 but the Cajun and Med were 8's. The Japenese was disorganized the service was slow, but the food rather good, but don't count on Sushi if you are a big fan.Drinks; Super Great Staff, but agree the blended drinks had a powdered taste, but that didn't slow us down.Rooms: The A/C works fine and is adjustable in your room. Maintained a room temp of 69掳F during upper 80's. However, the power goes out at least once a day for 10-30 minutes. Very clean, well maintained, very very nice, Jr Suite with sitting area and patio. We were located in room 1115, which was perfect for dinner. First row from the main complex but several building off the main corridor to the beach. I say perfect for dinner becasue having to wear long pants even in the evening when it's 80 you don't want to take a long walk. However, the long walk to the beach is fine becasue you are dressed for it. Not that the sound of the waves and the breeze won't of been nice. If location is important, call the property the day or two before and request general location, becasue when you get there the rooms are pre-assigned and packets are assembled and even a $50 incentive was not considered by the staff.Grounds; Perfect! Peacocks could sleep later for my taste. They are pretty regular with a crowing noise at 6:45 am. I think it was mating season too!Beach; The best and very walkable for miles. The topless aspect is no big deal, and when in Rome!Construction next door was not an issues but heard of some who complained.Golf; We golfed at the Punta Cana Golf Club and really enjoyed oursevles. 30 minute drive and several holes along the beach. We would go back, but are not the type to re-visit the same hotel becasue we like to expereince differences. Our next trip to Punta Cana will be around the golf resorts.

<Content>Okay, but I liked Mexico Better! My husband and I just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro last night. While it was a nice resort, I have been to all-inclusive resorts in Mexico that are much better. Our room was okay, large and spacious. The food was very typical of an all-inclusive resort. I did not like having to make reservations in order to eat at the speciality restaraunts. This was a long process in which we had to wait in line to make our reservations. In fact, we did not get a chance to eat at all the restaraunts we wanted. At other all-inclusive resorts you are able to just walk-in to any restaraunt you like. The beach was beautiful, however they did not have anyone taking drink orders. We had to get up VERY early to save chairs at the pool each morning. One morning someone stole our towels while we were swimming and we were unable to get new towel cards until we paid 10.00 a piece. Neither my husband or myself had a warm shower the entire trip, it was always very cold. Also, the electricity frequently shut off for periods of time. If I had never been to an all-inclusive resort prior to this trip I would probably think this was a very nice resort. However, we have stayed at two of the Palace resorts in Mexico and the Bavaro can not compare to the service and quality of these resorts.

<Content>We will be back!!!! Two families travelled ages between 55 and 9. Travelled with First Choice. Plenty to do all day long if thats what you want, or you can just chill by the pool. Hotel grounds are beautiful, well kept gardens, pool areas clean. We have stayed at Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus (south of DR by Caribbean sea) and Iberostar Costa Dorada (north of DR) We found the beach on the south of the island the best as the sea was always calm and turquoise blue, Bavaro was our second fav, the beach here lovely soft sand and lovely sea. The beach at Costa Dorada was not so good, dark coarse sand and much rougher sea. The staff were all very helpful and happy and always saying hola. The children could always find food they liked in the buffet which was very good. We didnt like the Japanese resteraunt at all..the service was very poor and slow, and when the food came, it was cold and even still frozen in one case! The Gourmet resteraunt was excellent, by far the best. We went on a Saturday night for the romantic dinner. Given bubbly and flower on arrival. Lovely setting. The Jambalaya (cajun) was also very good, we would rate this our second favourite. We stayed for 2 weeks and managed to get as many speciality resteraunts as we wanted, which for a party of 10 was good, although adults only at Gourmet. We tried the mexican resteraunt located in the IB Dominican next door which we were not very keen on. No atmosphere and food not partically good. It can be difficult to get reservations in the IB Dominicana and IB Punta Cana as they give priority to their guests first and as we were there for Easter, the hotels were at full capacity.The rooms were the best out of the 3 IB hotels that we have stayed at in DR and better than IB Tucan in Mexico. Plenty of room, newly re furbished bathrooms, TV, coffee maker, iron and ironing board. There are intercommunicating rooms available for families. Its best to e-mail in advance and request one. Our friends had requested one but didnt get it on arrival. They were able to move the following day-reception staff were very helpful regarding this.We tended to spend most of the day by the pool and go to the beach around 3pm for a change of scenery and also to enjoy the breeze which was most welcoming. You can walk for miles along the beach. If you fancy taking a trip on a speed boat to the natural pool (about 15 mins away) and snorkelling, we would recommend Pedro who runs a small boat from just by the shack shops to the right of the resort. We were charged $20 per adult and $10 per child for a 2 1/2 hour trip which we thought was excellent value, much cheaper than booking through the hotel reps. His mate Manuel was good fun too!!The star friends were good fun, especially Oscar, J P and Henry. The shows in the evening were OK, some better than others but quite entertaining. Had a massage at the spa which was good. If you are thinking of visiting this hotel you wont be disappointed. We are already thinking of returning next year. !! Try to remember to tip the staff who dont normally receive many tips, ie the gardeners and glass collecters, they work very hard too!!

<Content>Outstanding! Easter week- so a little crowded (lots of Americans) Great Beach (clean, not too crowded) Great Rooms (jr suite was big), some rooms a long way from the beach!Nice pool.  Very friendly staff - lots of activities. Disco opened kind of late. Food was plentiful (and fairly good) Good breakfast (lots of choices)Steak house and Japanese restaurant were good (not great)The 'try scuba' group at the pool did a little bit of a 'hard sell to get you to go on their excursions. We would definitely go back!

<Content>Family of five experience This was our third trip to the DR, second with kids (last year at Sunscape The Beach know called Dreams) and Secrets w/ another couple. Positives for this property: beautiful grounds, great service w/ almost no exceptions, surprisingly good food for an all inclusive, large rooms, good drinks, above average casino for a DR resort, beautiful beach. One example of the accommodating staff - we showed up in the lobby for our 9:30am transfer to the airport to be told that our flight was delayed to 5pm. No problem, the staff let us have our room back so we could enjoy the beach and pool for the day.Negatives: Dreams has more kids activities including a beachfront, large capacity trampleline, a climbing toy in the pool (great for the 8 to 14 year old), nicer sports center, and tons of resort provided rafts. The beach at the Iberostar is more crowded as its surrounded by dozens of other resorts and everyone goes for a walk on the beach. We're not talking Delaware beach in August crowded but more than the western, more isolated resorts.Overall, we would definitely go back to the Iberostar. I would say that the Bavarro is worth the extra money compared to the two other Iberostars as its less crowded and the service is better.

<Content>good, not fantastic We just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro. We had a nice time, but I want to pass along our impressions of the resort. First of all, the beach is very nice. Fantastic sand, and lovely water. They had some very high waves that wiped out much of the beach, but they were working diligently to repair all damage. They also seemed to be the only resort along the beach that was concerned if their patrons were entering water that was unsafe. They had guards keeping people back from the rough water, while the other resorts didn't have anyone around - just red flags. Our room was fine. As others have stated, the rooms were musty and even after washing all of our clothing I can still smell it a bit. They maid did a decent job cleaning, but she did help herself to some money that my son dropped on the floor.  The food was fairly good. Not the best we have had at an all-inclusive, but not the worst either. We did have two (out of 6) of us not feel very well for a day or two. Not horribly ill, just a bit sick to our stomachs. We also had a bit of difficulty getting dinner reservations. This was surprising because the nights we did eat at the restaurants they were over half empty.  The icy drinks were very sugary and were clearly made from cheaper mixes. They came out of machines which were often not frozen. The main bar in the lobby had the best drinks. The shows were a bit hokey, but they tried. My kids enjoyed them. The bottom line for us is that it was a fairly nice resort. We stayed at the Iberostar Paraiso Maya (Riviera Maya) and it was a much nicer resort than the Bavaro. We also stayed at the Barcelo Maya, and theIberostar Bavaro topped that one slightly.

<Content>Loved it!!!!! This was our second trip to the IBB and our fith time in the DR. We stayed at the old Coral Hamaca in Boca Chica the prior 3 stays, and now will only go to the IBB. Our only problem was the room we were first given. It was on the south side of the resort and right next to the construction going on next door. After complaining about the noise and explaining we were repeat guests, we were moved to a much quieter area.The food was better than the prior time we were there (2 years ago). The steak house was excellent, the Cajon very good, and the Mexican was a little bit of a let down.The beach buffett was great. Better than the last time we were there.Lobby bar was the best. Can't understand why they don't put more money/effort into the casino. Small and very poorly run, with just a little more attention, it would be a gold mine.Beach was unbeleveable, warm, clean, and always found a tiki hut.Hope everyone has the great time myself, my wife, and my two kids had.....

<Content>hmmmmmmmmmmmm 5 star? great snorkling right off beach. food is plentiful. Mold in rooms is a problem. You and your clothes will come home with a stench from the rooms. grounds are fantastic. service is good unless a superior is in the same line they will get servedd first. hours of shops are limited. bring a clock or watch. refuse a room with mold. it's hot away from the beach air conditioning is non existent they must use swamp coolers nothing you can do sprays just hide the smell won't fix problem

<Content>Great family vacation for all--we had a blast! Just returned from our 5 night stay the the Bavaro and it was awesome. We were impressed with the staff, cleanliness of the resort and the fun island atmosphere! We would like to go back again. We traveled with two kids (ages 6 and 10). Lots of great activities. Kids club is good but my kids wanted to be with us. They did it one day and the young one loved it--older was a little grumpy at times since it was a very scheduled day for the kids. A few tips:1. be sure to bring singles--the tipping goes a long way. I know you don't have to do it but it is very much appreciated and these folks work LONG and hard days.2. it is a big facility so it will take a few days to acclimate. Beach is great--lots of fun volleyball and beach walks. It can get windy at night.3. Swim up pool bar is great--ask for Salas. Drinks are not watered down and the limonada with rum and cuba libres are super refreshing. 4. Wear SUNSCREEN. Sun is hot and you will get burned Seek shade at times or you will fry!5. Take advantage of the activities. They have great water aerobics and fun dancing lessons. 6. Make your reservations for dinner on the first night. It can be tricky if you have a big party. 7. Minibar is filled and they will give you extra bottled water if you leave a few singles--we were overstocked many of the days.8. Casino is small and not much to see. We did not play any tables just watched.9. DIsco is interesting BUT VERY YOUNG. Drinking age is 18 so we felt old at the venue.Overall, it was a family trip to remember. If you go, stay longer than 5 nights. We wished we had booked a full 7 nights. It felt a little rushed at times since there is so much to do. The kids did not want to go.Will post pictures later this weekend. Enjoy the island experience. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>wont go wrong The grounds were extreamly well kept up and an abundance of palm trees. Rooms were above adverage in size and well appointed with small refrigerator and mini bar. The wait staff were very polite and always smiling. Food selection was nice and the buffet had many cook to order items for breakfast and dinner, lunch for us was out at the pool and a large selection out there too. Bar service was very good but did not have everything.The beach and pool were very well kept up and many place to get out of the sun if you want to. The only compliant was the room we had was a little close to the lobby and at night that was where the entertainment was till about 11:30PM or so, if you are looking for quiet try to get a room closer to the beach. If you stay at the Bavaro which I believe is the best one of these three on Punta Cana you have access to the bars and reasturants at the other two Iberostar resorts. I would go back to this resort again if the oppotunity came up. We were told at the check-in that the rooms have been all renovated in the past few years.

<Content>Loved It!!!!!!! This was the best all inclusive trip I have taken in 6 years. The food was excellent at every meal. The sand was like powder and the softest on my feet. I have never been on vacation and encountered so many friendly staff. I would recommend this resort to anyone, I don't think I want to go back to Mexico. This country is beautiful!

<Content>Don't book the Saona Catamaran tour from the Bavaro Just returned from a week at the Bavaro. Excellent service, staff and entertainment. Food at the buffet is wonderful however the Med. and Mexican restaurants were very dissapointing. DO NOT book the Saona Island Catamaran trip they try to push on you! Way too long of a day. Pick up at 7 and get dropped back off at hotel at 8 pm. You go from bus to bus and boat to boat and stop all along the way at horrible stops with no running water and 1 restroom for 4 busses of people. You will spend less than 2 hours on the actual Island which is no better than the beach at the hotels with a terrible barbeque lunch! No running water or flushing bathrooms on the site! 3 hr. buss ride there and 3 hrs. back! They do not have the logistics of these trips worked out at all! At one point we were dopped off by one bus without even being told what was happening to be picked up at a stop by another bus? Don't bother to complain they are in denial! Everything is always 3 times longer than they say!!!!!!!

<Content>Wonderful Honeymoon There! We honeymooned at this resort and LOVED IT. We liked being able to lay around and do nothing, especially after planning a wedding. The beach was amazing, the staff were friendly and accommodating, the gourmet restaurant was fantastic. We went to a specialty restaurant almost every night and they were all great. The Japanese one was probably our least favorite--just not as fancy. The check-in process was amazingly fast. The grounds were beautiful. The peacocks were fine even though we expected them to be annoying. The swim up bar was nice. If you're on the beach, grab a hut early as they fill up. Our room was fine. The bathroom above us had a leak one day, but when we called maintenance they were there in less than five minutes and did a great job. They were starting to renovate suites while we were there, but the construction crews were very neat and we did not have a problem. The shows at night were fun and lively and got the audience involved. Waitresses did a nice job of bringing drinks during the shows. Weather was extremely humid; was a little bit of a problem in the interior of the resort. Beach was much nicer due to breeze. Couldn't safely leave the resort just for sight-seeing, but did book a safari trip that was excellent and really allowed you to see the D.R. Eddie was our guide and he was the best. Met some other very nice couples. Overall had a great trip and now compare other resorts to the Iberostar Bavaro. Good price, good value, highly recommend it.

<Content>Wonderful Trip For All We were in Punta Cana from Feb 20th to the 27th. When we landed the Apple rep was very helpful and got us and our luggage to the bus rather quickly. Once we got to the hotel we checked in and our daughter in law immediately made our 3 restaurant reservations for the steak house, Japanese and Mediterranean. We also tried the Cajun which I liked the best. Yes the buffet had some interesting food however; for the most part the food was good and plenty of it. I ordered a bandy old fashion which I explained in full detailed and received a fluorescent blue drink. The beach was beautiful, so was the weather. My husband and I highly recommend the Outback Safari tour. It really gives you a better picture on how the real Dominican people live. Yes there are topless women at the beach but this lends to the fact of the many cultures vacationing at the hotel. We met many wonderful people and participated in the daily challenges, arm wrestling, and beer drinking and daily bingo. My Son won both of the above. The grounds were beautiful and the rooms were clean to even my satisfaction however, we are still trying to get the musty smell out of our clothes. I love being tan and having such great warm weather so early in the season. Would we go back? YES鈥?.If you go please say hello to J.P (one of the staff) from Maddie鈥?I will be downloading pictures soon鈥?

<Content>Great Vacation!!! We just returned yesterday from a fantastic vacation!! The entire trip was enjoyable. The staff at the Iberostar were very friendly and catered to your every need! The weather was great. It rained early one morning , but cleared up by 10:00. We stayed four nights and made reservations out three nights. Friday night they have lobster at the buffet so we decided to eat there. The food was exceptional each night. One night we went to the Cajun Resteraunt and I picked at my food because it was a little too spicey. The waitress came over and got me a special made meal, the best garlic shrimp, cooked perfectly. The beaches were beautiful and the grounds are very well maintained. The pools are nice too. We went to several shows which were entertaining. The service there was also good. We spent some of our nights at the casino, unfortanately we didn't win. We spent most of the time on the beach laying around, drinking rum drinks, going for long walks on the beach. There is a flea market type place down the one end of the beach where we bought souvineers. My husband on a fishing excursion and he caught a Mahi Mahi. We have been to several all inclusive resorts, we feel this was the best so far. We will be returning!!

<Content>great hotel, great weather we just returned from Iberostar Bavaroand and had a great time.rooms are very large and hotel is immense. best restuarant in our opinion is the Gourmet.we didn't like the mediterranian at all.portions are small,but you don't leave hungary.the pool bar is in the shade,so didn't spend much time there.went on a Marinium tour,which is a party boat with snoerkling.well worth the money.there are coffee makers in all the rooms also. we stayed in room 2392. very close to the pool and several of the restuarants. very diffucult to communicate. Hardly anyone speaks english.Have been to mexico (Riveira Maya) twice and the service is much better there. waited sometimes 15 minutes for a drink!!! overall the hotel is nice,but would go back to Mexico but not Punta Cana.

<Content>It was paradise!!! This was a first trip alone for my husband and my 40th anniversary. We went on the recommendation of my sister who has vacationed here for 11 years. We can see why. While I was unpacking, my husband went to look around and came back and said, If I don't go to heaven I want to come here! High praise ! It has the most beautiful beach and pool area...and the people couldn't have been nicer or friendlier! The shows were excellent and even though the casino was small we managed to fine a couple of machines we liked. Our room was lovely with a nice view of the grounds. The weather was perfect sunny and breezy everyday. We had a great massage on the beach. We loved the all inclusive, it was nice to just get up after dinner and not wait for a check. We went to the Japanese, Cajun, and Mediterranean restaurants. The Japanese was our favorite. I agree with another reviewer about the toplessness. After seeing a few it's no big deal. We can't wait to go back!!!!!

<Content>Very nice, has room for improvement My wife and I just returned from an 8 night stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. This was our second vacation in the DR and our fifth stay at an Iberostar resort. The airport, customs and immigration process has improved somewhat, but it still is inefficient when compared to Mexico. Our shuttle ride was ok, as it went only to the Iberostar complex and check in was unremarkble. The grounds are lush and well manicured. The 1st floor suite was a bit on the worn side, but spacious and relatively comfortable and close to the beach. There is construction going on adjacent to the complex, so ask where your suite is located, as the noise there does start pretty early. The beach was extremely nice, most definitely the best asset, in my opinion. Temps were in the 80s with sunny skies all week. The pool appeared somewhat small for the resort size, but it was well kept and clean. There was a fairly high level of attention to detail in the management of that area of the resort, as it is a focal point. The main buffet, however, was somthing of a disapointment. At peak times it seemed understaffed and the design of the serving area was not conducive to a larger crowd. We found the buffet at the Domincana to be set up and managed better, especially at peak times. The food was reasonablely decent and at the specialty restaraunts it was above average. We tried the Med. (La Dorada) the oriental (LaPagoda) and the gourmet (LeCouple) and found them to be more than satisfactory. The steak house at the Bavaro beach was only average. Service by staff was somewhat uneven, at times very good, at times not so hot. Overall, a bit lower quality wise when compared to the Paraiso Del Mar. Day trips and excursions are a bit of an iffy propostion, probably best to take the advice of the travel agency rep with a grain of salt and do research on the options in advance. The hotel will only exchange Traveler's checks for Dominican pesos and they do shave a bit off the official rate. It is a nice resort, failry well managed and has much t orecommend it, as long as one doesn't expect perfection. You have to go with the flow and adapt to the inevitable minor inconveniences and crowds in the pool areas and restaraunts.

<Content>KIDS (LUCY'S) CLUB - Perspective from a family w/ 3  I wanted to write a review from the perspective of people with little kids. These reviews were so helpful, I needed to give back. I've also added tips for people already going.PERSPECTIVEReading these reviews, it is hard to tell the perspective of the writer, so here's an attempt. We are a family of four with two kids, 3 and 4 1/2 years old. We almost always cook at home from scratch and shop at Whole Foods about 1/4 of the time. We will eat fast food once a month or so when on the road or just plain out of time. Our kids watch about 15-30 minutes of TV every other day. We like good restaurants and really dislike bad restaurants (e.g. Applebees). This is the first all inclusive vacation I have ever taken. My wife has been to the Robinson's Club (German version of Club Med) as a teen.KIDS CLUB (LUCY'S CLUB) One of our primary reasons for booking an all inclusive was to get a break from the kids. In this respect, I rate the Kids Club neutral. The main person, Keila, was fabulous with the kids. When she gets them out to do the activities, like tennis, swimming, etc., she's great with the kids. She even expressed concern on the third day that our kids were only eating hot dogs and french fries when she took them to lunch. They ate well at breakfast and dinner, so we didn't sweat it. It's vacation! The little house itself is near the side of the Iberostar Bavaro that borders the Iberostar Dominica. It is one open room with a mini pool table, mini ping pong, drawing, legos, a bunch of Little Tikes toys (including a couple in the back yard area), a trampoline outside, and a TV that is ALWAYS ON. I can't say we were too happy about that. There are usually two or three people there, and they will do some interaction with the kids there. There is a schedule of activities. It is no comparison to Club Med (from what others told me). The main activity is to go to the pool. This was fine by us. Tennis was really the only other real activity that happened, and it was based on whether the kids wanted to go. Many of the kids were too glued to the TV to be interested.For our kids, the highlight was the Mini Disco Show on every night at 7:30. Led by Keila, it was the kids, up on the main stage, doing the Hokey Pokey and a bunch of other little dances together (a lot of Spanish kids songs I don't know).One amazing aspect is that there were kids that spoke French, Spanish, German, and English, and they all got along and figured out how to communicate! I have to say this was a really nice aspect, and that Keila and staff can communicate in all these languages is great.Most of the kids were probably 4-7 years old. It is not engaging enough for any older kids, in my opinion. FOODThe food was pretty good overall. There was always something good at the buffets. You could always fall back on making a great salad and having fresh tropical fruits. Always something healthy, always something greasy, and stuff in between, take your pick. The grills out at the buffets near the pools were, imho, the best. Could eat that grilled chicken every day. Buffet rules apply - get stuff fresh, any made to order food is a little better, hot foods sitting around too long get overcooked, go early, etc. Desert was the best.The Japanese place was NOT equal to any Japanese restaurant, as prior reviews suggested, but was OK. TENNISIf you are at all interested in playing tennis, get to the courts first thing in the morning (sign up for the next day comes out at 8:00am the day before). Two clay courts and one hard court. Racquets (including kids) are available, so you don't have to pack them. Real tennis shoes (not running shoes), especially on the clay courts because other shoes tear them apart.CONSTRUCTIONIf you look at the attached picture, which is a layout of the facility, you will see where the construction is going on. They are building another hotel, approximately the size of the Dominica. It will be an adults only facility. You can see where we stayed on the map (117). Construction never bothered us at all.OVERALLNicest sand I've ever been on. Great azur water - and warm! Perfect weather every day.Really international crowd. German., French, Spanish, Latin Americans (avoiding Carnival season in their own countries!), Americans, Russians all were there.My wife felt the overall Iberostar compound was too big. I did not think so. Everything we asked for - put our beds together to have one big bed, make up one of the couches as another bed for our kids, extra drinks, etc. was all provided for. Solid service.SIDE NOTEIn discussions with the staff (between 1,000 to 1,500 at the 3 Iberostars, depending whom you ask), many work at the hotels for 3-4 weeks straight, then go home to the capital for four days to see their families, and come back. Housing is too expensive to move their families to Punta Cana. My wife, concerned for the separation of these families, indignantly protested that the government should do something about this. Well, they had. They built a whole bunch of apartments in the nearby town to support the hotel workers. However, the tourists came in and bought up all the apartments.

<Content>Relaxing week at the Iberostar Bavaro Just returned from a relaxing, hassle free week at the Iberostar Bavaro. Check in was quick and simple. The room was spacious though it lacked dressers and my daughter complained about her bed. The bathroom was updated, as was the room. The grounds were lovely and we constantly saw workers cleaning up the grounds and grooming the trees. They clearly put a large emphasis into up-keep and maintenance. We spend most of our time at the pool which was great. The beach, as others have noted was absolutely lovely. The water was warm and it was great for long walks. There was much shade throughout for us who don't like to get sun burned. As for the food, it was adequate though after a week I was tired of it. The specialty resturants provided a nice change. We enjoyed the Canjun the best. While the Mexican was difficult to get into it was adequate at best (that's just my opinion, others in my family liked it). The staff was lovely - they were attentive, but not overly so. Overall, we liked the relaxed and low keyed feel of the place. One week of doing very little was enough for all of us and while we enjoyed our stay we were all ready to return home. I should add that none of us got bug bites and we did not see any mosquitos.

<Content>Would go back. We (family of four) stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from Feb 13 thru Feb 20. All in all, a magnificent facility.I will limit my review to items I did not see in other reviews.Many people have made reference to the specialty restaurants, and the ones we went to (Cajun, Steakhouse  Japaneese) were all very good. However, do not book a specialty restaurant on Friday. Friday is all-you-can-eat grilled lobster at the buffet.There is no internet at the Bavaro but they do have an internet cafe at the commercial center in front of the Iberostar Dominicana next door. The comercial center is where the disco is located. You have to purchase a login and password from the front desk at the Dominicana to use the computers. It costs $5.00 US for 30 minutes.We did some scuba diving while we were there. There is a PADI facility on-site called Dressel Divers. They are based in Spain but all of their employees that we met spoke excellent English (and French and Spanish and German and Portugese). If you are a very experienced diver, you may be happier doing your diving with ScubaCaribe. My impression is that Dressel does a lot of resort courses and therefore spends most of thier time with inexperienced divers. Prepare to hear a summary of the PADI Open Water Diver Manual with every briefing, and they are EXTREEMELY vigilant about keeping the dive group together. We were there during winter season, so they were unable to visit a lot of thier usual dive sites becuase of sea conditions. Bavaro is on the Atlantic side and has poor diving compared to most of the Carribean. Not a lot of life or colorful coral and the visibility is only fair to good. The diving on the other side of the island is very good and excursions can be arranged through Dressel. Although it will burn up an entire day, (they leave at 7:00 AM and return between 7:00 and 8:00 PM) I felt that the quality of the diving on the other side made it worth the inconvenience.I have an ATT cell phone with international roaming and had no trouble placing cell phone calls. Even if your plan includes free roaming, be prepared for $3.00 to $4.00 per minute roaming fees from the local cellular provider.This resort has a lot of visitors from Europe, so tops are optional on the beach. Unless you are easily offended, this is not the big deal it sounds like to most Americans. The initial shock wears off in about three minutes. Trust me, it is a long way from a girls gone wild video. Another warning, Europeans normal swimwear for men is speedo style suits and bikinis on women REGARDLESS of body type.

<Content>Want to Return My husband and I stayed at Iberostar Bavaro Feb 7-14. Our second time staying at an Iberostar-our first time in Punta Cana. From the second we stepped off the plane we noticed the friendliness of the Dominican people.Our check-in at the Bavaro was quick-we were even whisked straight to our room in a golf cart. Our room was close to the beach and restaurants. Being beach people we never made it to the pool but it was beautiful. The beach seating was plentiful and comfortable. It was nice to be able to walk up and down the beach as far as we wanted to go.The food is terrific. A wide variety of everything; I especially love their pastries. We were guaranteed 3 dinner reservations with our 7 night stay. We chose Japanese, Cajun, and the steakhouse. The service was poor at Japanese but the almond chicken was good. The Cajun was our favorite-waiters were prompt and gracious; their food was terrific. Steakhouse was good, also. We ate in the buffet restaurant every morning for breakfast and at night when we didn't have a reservation. Always excellent service there.We attended the night shows and enjoyed them. The Star Friends really put on an entertaining show and work long hours to get there.We went on two excursions-outback safari and deep sea fishing. The safari was a bumpy ride thru the area but we learned a lot about the country, people, and their daily life. Deep sea fishing was another story-windy, rough, huge waves, and a mutual decision to return to land.All in all, we had a wonderful trip and would go back tomorrow if we had the chance!!

<Content>A typical all-inclusive, with nice facilities, good service, and mediocre food My wife and I just returned from a 5 day, 4 night stay at Iberostar Bavaro with another couple. This was our third trip to an all-inclusive (AI) resort. This is a typical AI place, with nice facilities, good service, and mediocre food. We picked Punta Cana, because it was cheaper than Puerto Plata or most other Caribbean locations and we could use Skymiles to get there. We then tried to find the best AI in that town using TripAdvisor reviews. The resorts in Punta Cana are insulated from the rest of the island, which appeared to be very rough and poor. We did not venture off the resort.On the positive side, the resort is nicely decorated, landscaped, and groomed. It鈥檚 a fairly expansive campus, and every inch of it is in good shape. The public restrooms even met my wife鈥檚 stringent standards. Our room was nicely appointed and clean. Our only complaints were sporadic hot water and a skimpy selection in the minibar refrigerator. The pool is nice and the beach is superb. It is wide with plenty of loungers and 鈥渦mbrellas鈥?for shade. The water was clear with little sea grass to deal with. The waves were constant and steady 鈥?not large enough to body surf, but also calm enough to relax. There is some coral just off the beach and lots of fish to see, so snorkeling or just 鈥済oggling鈥?is recommended. The open-air gym is pretty decent. We did not try the spa.The other two Iberostar properties are adjacent to Bavaro and within a few minutes walk to one side. There are other resorts on the other side, so the result is a long beach that stretches for miles and is worth walking 鈥?not like some places we鈥檝e been to, where the nice beach ends at the border of the resort鈥檚 property. There are plenty of opportunities for games and sports, too. One note to parents: there was quite a bit of toplessness. The nightly entertainment consisted of the usual cheesy productions put on by the wait staff鈥 guess it鈥檚 good for kids, but I preferred the music played by local musicians after the shows. We spent our evenings walking around and then playing cards near the bar.On the negative side, the food and drinks were disappointing. We didn鈥檛 really have high expectations, but we were under the impression that Iberostar's emphasis was 鈥渙n quality food and beverages鈥︹€?(Fodors.com). It was nothing special. We tried three of the restaurants for dinner (Cajun, Mediterranean, and gourmet), and they were all disappointing. A couple of the fish dishes were ok. The buffets were just ok too. In general, the meats and seafood are low grade and the vegetables aren鈥檛 too flavorful. On the brighter side, the fruits were pretty fresh and the deserts were always pretty good. The real surprise was the bars. All of their fruity drinks are premixed and taste like it. Once, one of us asked if he could get a drink made fresh with an actual blended banana. The waiter said no, that all of their drinks are 鈥渙riginal鈥?! Later we decided to take matters in to our own hands and went to the fruit juice bar with some rum from the bar and made our own drinks. The woman at the juice bar looked at us like we had just invented the wheel. My hope of getting a good Pina Colada was dashed. On another occasion, a dirty martini arrived without olives or olive juice and with a lime slice instead. Finally, there is no drink service on the beach.Overall, I think that, despite the mediocre food and drink, the beach and facilities make Iberostar Bavaro nicer than most AI resorts. It鈥檚 relatively inexpensive and good for a 4-5 day vacation. Any more than that and you may get sick of the food and entertainment. It鈥檚 worth considering for your next vacation, but I think we鈥檒l keep looking for an all-inclusive that can offer the complete package. I鈥檇 rather spend more to get more and to be on an island where I feel safe to go off the resort too.

<Content>Iberstar Bavaro We returned form Iberostar Bavaro last nite. This was our third stay at this resort, and were there from 2/6 to 2/14. I could have stayed longer. See my review from last february under zvago. I say ditto to all of that. New remarks: Checkin was smooth and fabulous. Book your dinner reservations ASAP, although, if you eat earlier (by 7:30) there will be no problem. We LOVED the Japanese restaurant this time, as did 12 of our friends who were there before us. A little hint , with ALL of the restuarants, if you show up early for your dinner, they will always accomodate you. Breakfast was wonderful.....Always go to Marisol??? for omelets. As you enter the buffet, she is at the station to the right. She is quick and cooks to order. Very pleasant. There were fewer bus people at the buffet, so I found one had to flag down waiters for coffee. That was my biggest problem. Watch for slippery walkways.....The last nite we were there, they had resurfaced the bridge leading to the main building. Many people fell on it. Be alert, Americans, watch for walkways and ramps. The Dominicans expect you to look out for yourself, NOT take care of protecting you from dangers. There are no cones, yellow lines on steps, or railings where we would expect them. There were many more American couples at the hotel then previously.Being American, this was NOT what I was looking for.Also, many more children than usual. Most families with children , however,were European, and I found them fascinating. The children were ALL so well behaved and soft spoken I NEVER heard children screaming or parents correcting them. Admirable.!Many more peacocks than before,,,,to the point of being annoying.******************There is construction of a new hotel going on to the right of the property(as you look at the beach) Do NOT accept rooms on that side of the property. In addition to the BANGING BANGING BANGING you have to endure the strong SMELL of concrete all of the time.Our weather was iffy. Very strong wind for the entire nine days. Rain ususally at nite. My brother was there the week before, and it was the same. The week before that, there was rain all week. So good luck you are due for good weather. We still had a ball. As usual, the drinks at the pool bar are slop----better to drink at the Main Lobby bar. Ask for brands. Feel free to contact me.

<Content>Awesome time at the Bavaro We just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro yesterday. Everything about the resort was top notch. The weather was in the mid to high 80's and it was sunny everyday. The beach is just as great as everyone says it is. The sand was powder soft and never got hot. We never had a problem getting a first row hut and we didn't get out there until between 9 and 10. We always saw huts and chairs available all throughout the day. It was near the dive shop and more away from the pool area. We didn't use the pool but it was a sight to see. Huge with an island and fountain in the middle....maybe just a tad cooler than the ocean. The Star friends ran a lot of games through out the day at the pool. Speaking of the Star friends or any of the workers for that matter. They were so nice and always happy and singing. Nothing was too much trouble. We asked at dinner once where we could purchase some of their house wine and they just wrapped up a bottle and gave it to us. The food was the best I've ever had anywhere. Including cruises. We had all you can eat Lobster at the buffet one night. There was Filet Mignon and Lamb that we had at the Gormet, totally melt in your mouth tender rib eye steaks at the Steak house and some excellant fish at the Metaterranien. At the buffet they always had something they were cooking to order as well as a huge selection of just about everything else. The desserts...(ice cream hut open all day at the beach buffet), cheeses, fruits and main entrees were great. They had a beach party a couple of times while we were there with a band playing and dancing while eating lunch. We never used room service but it was available 24/7 with sandwich type things. It was windy while we were there but I think it is usually like that. Would have been too hot if it weren't breezy.The rooms were excellant also. We had a King room right next to the beach. Everyday there were fresh flowers in the towel creations the maid did up. We even got a bottle of rum and fresh fruit plate three times during our stay. I think that was due to me telling them it was our 30th anniversary so they did special things for us. There was a coffee maker in our room and an iron and ironing board as well as a hair dryer. I liked my hair dryer better though since theirs' was not as powerful and it got hot to hold after a while. The shower was big enough for two and they had a separate tub. The plugs were fine for our appliances. We really only used the water out of the mini bar since we had to use it instead of the tap. We never ran out. The patio was nice with a love seat type couch and a small table and chair.The peacocks never bothered us although they did seem louder by the lobby. (maybe we were just blessed with quiet ones?) We went into the disco one night just as they opened and it seemed really cool with the airplane incorporated. Apparently a plane had crashed somewhere...(they had pictures up) and they used a lot of the parts. The wings were the bars and the cockpit was the place where the DJ sat and spun records, the fusalage was the enterance and it wasn't too loud or too cold in there. We didn't stay though since we were tired. The Star rock cafe was a neat place too but the eating area was quite small and so we never got in. It was like a 50's type eatery with an old car of some sort...(sorry I don't know my cars) in the corner and a few pool tables around the outer areas. The Casino was OK. The machines took American dollars...and ate all of mine. :o) Ok, I mean I just didn't win. Would have been much more than Ok had I won. The internet room was quite big with a lot of computers...I didn't count but I'd say around12 -14 available. It was 5.00 a half hour. You just bought your password and username at the reception area. The bad part was that you couldn't just add to it, you had to buy a new password. The shows were good....funny even. A lot of audience participation was incorporated rather than just sitting and being entertained. They had a very good band that played from 8-9 pm and then again after the show around 10:30 until 11:30 if you like to dance or even if you just want to listen.All in all it was a great vacation. If you like a lot of things to do outside the resort though, there wasn't a lot like in Mexico. The resort did have the usual offerings of different games like tennis, archery, air rifles, etc. We didn't take advantage of those since we were into lazy. It was wonderful to go and relax and be pampered. Contact me if you would like to know more.

<Content>Love the Iberostar Bavaro This was my second time staying at the Iberostar Bavaro, and it won't be the last!! Every year a girls getaway takes us to the Sun...and this year we had to return to Punta Cana. The staff is amazing, the food terrific, and you can't beat the weather. The massages on the beach are incredible...so good we did them twice!! The nightly shows are great and this year soo funny!! The grounds are well cared for and always clean. We will continue to return until...well until forever!!

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro rocks We just got back from a week stay at Iberostar Bavaro (Feb 2 -Feb 9)Check in was the easiest thing I've experienced. It took about 4 minutes for us to get our keys and our luggage showed up in our room about 4 minutes later. Great service.We had room 2557 (very close to the lobby). The rooms are very large (Junior Suites) of about 40 m虏 with a huge bed and sitting space. A little noise from the show at night but, it didn't bother us at all. The reality is that we don't spend that much time in there because the beach and the weather is fantastic.The beach is truly beautiful and is extremely long- you could walk for hours to go from one end to the other. The sand is soft as flour. The water is very warm and there are only tiny little waves that break on the beach. It is fully equipped with chairs and plenty of shade. We had no problems finding seats together at the beach. There is a nice little bar at the beach to get drinks and snacks. Also, There are people taking orders directly on the beach. Very nice!Before I forget, the employees here are adorable. They are professional and friendly all the time.The pool is nice as well but, we barely used it. It also has a swim up bar and different things like water aerobics, dance classes and scuba initiation going on.The food was very good as well. I have read some reviews that complain that the food is the same at the buffet. The buffets have EVERYTHING I could think of. In the morning there is everything from eggs, bacon, pancakes, cereal, fruit, very good fresh squeezed fruit drinks, yogurt, cheese to bread and pastries. What else could you ask for. We ate at three speciality restaurants: Steak house, japanese and meditereanean. The three were gret. The Rib eye steak was very tender at the Steak House. The sushi was pretty good as well and the fish restaurant had a large variety. For those of you who like lobster, they havea friday night grill with Lobster. Very tasty.A final word about the service. Whether it be the cleaning service, gardening, bar or table service, it was always friendly and fast.If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me.

<Content>Met my expectations and then some... I went with a group of friends the third week of January. The Iberostar Bavaro was very good overall. I am particular about cleanliness. I found the rooms to be very clean. There was a great variety of good food to choose from. The beach (and I am not a big beach person) was excellent.Downsides 鈥?be sure you do not get a room adjacent to the new hotel that is under construction. Construction started early each day and ended well into the evening. It is also not a singles place. The vast majority of guests were either families or couples. Also, excursions are limited. Punta Cana is fairly remote and there is not really any place to go. Santa Domingo is 3 hours away.If you have any electronic items to charge, be sure to take an electrical plug adapter with you. It is American voltage, but a different plug. And take something to do for a rainy day. There is simply nothing to do there when it rains.I have been going to the Iberostar Pariso Lindo in the Rivera Maya for a number of years, which is also excellent. However, the Bavaro was a welcome change.

<Content>Really nice and great for the kids.... We booked our stay at the Ocean Blue and were shocked when we got there. It was awful. Our Apple rep was able to change the resort the same day and got our family into the Iberostar. It was really nice. Great place for the kids and all around good family resort. I don't think I've ever been to a resort where the food was great, but were thankful that it was at least clean and decent. The staff was wonderful and the kids had a blast. I would recommend it to any family looking for a nice vacation.

<Content>IBERO STAR BAVARO - GORGEOUS!! This was a surprise bday gift from Hubby...Although we only stayed for 5 days  4 nights, I must say this was a fantastic getaway from (baby  furbaby)! :)From the minute we landed to the day we left, everything was simply perfect and smooth!The entire grounds were breathtakingly beautiful, the staff was extremely friendly, the entertainment was uplifting, the food was plentiful  delish and most importantly, the weather was perfect!Hubby and I spent most of our days working on our tans and relaxing by the beach..Okay, also the bar (which was a swim-up).It was nice to see that it was very family friendly-but certainly not like Disneyland...The kids were well behaved and there was plenty of space to keep to themselves. It was our first time at an all inclusive vaca and I dont know if I'll ever do otherwise! :) This is definately one we'll be coming back to!!

<Content>Wonderful Vacation!!! My husband and I spent 5 days at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana. We will definitely be going back next year . We have been frequent visitors to the Carribean, but this was the loveliest location with the most exquisite beach. The service at this hotel was excellent. Any request was answered instantaneously. The suites were modern w/attractive bathrooms. Drinking the water was not a problem as the hotel water was purified; however, you needed to use bottled water to brush your teeth as the bathroom water was not. Neither of us got sick the entire time.The food at the specialty restaurants was very good. Both the lunch and bkst. buffets were also very good. The dinner buffet was OK. There was also afternnoon tea set up in the lobby.All the employees were very gracious and willing to go above and beyond the call of duty whether you tipped them or not.The evening shows were very good and one in particular was excellent. We brought 50 dollar bills w/us for tipping. The staff worked especially hard to make our vacation special. Unfortunately, they do not make much money beyond their room and board. Tips were greatly appreciated but not looked for. There was nothing negative abt. our stay. We enjoyed every moment thoroughly.

<Author>WarmWeatherLovers
<Content>We Love Punta Cana! We just got back this week from our third trip to Punta Cana. This was our second time staying at Iberostar Bavaro. I will review the details:Room: Our first day we were able to check in immediately upon arrival (late morning). We requested the room that we stayed in last year but it was occupied. We were placed in a room near the hotel lobby (we prefer near the beach). The first night we were tired so we went to bed early but were unable to sleep because the evening show (at the stage near the lobby) was quite loud. Anyway, we asked to be moved the next day and we were placed in the same room that we were in last year (near the beach and not too far from the pool). The room was clean, no mildew smell and the fridge was stocked with bottled water, beer and soft drinks. The maid cleaned the room early every day (8AM) so most days we placed the do not disturb sign so we could sleep til 8:30 or so. We went to breakfast around 9AM and the room was clean when we got back. We left a tip every day and always has clean towels, washcloths and a stocked fridge. We like that the rooms are like bungalows and that we had a porch with a table and chairs.Food: I am a picky eater and could always find something to eat. My husband ate a little bit of everything and enjoyed his meals. We sat in the same area to eat every day so that we had the same waiter. We tipped him daily and always had excellent service. We stayed for ten days and were tired of the buffet by then but the food overall was good. We disliked the Mexican restaurant, the Chinese was ok but we liked the romantic dinner on Saturday night in the Gourmet restaurant. I have to say that we liked the buffet better than the sit down meals because of the variety.Beach: The beach is beautiful. White sands and blue water. Lots of palapas and beach chairs. We spent most of our days on the beach. The only thing that is unusual are the topless women and the men in thong bathing suits (that's right, THONG bathing suits!) I figure that if they have the self confidence to dress like that then more power to them but it is a little bit disturbing.Pool: Beautiful with a swim up bar but the water was too cold. It was very clean though.Shopping: There are several gift shops throughout the hotel. The prices are higher but you come to expect that. There is a flea market on the beach but be prepared to negotiate. The rule of thumb is to offer 1/3 of the asking price and go from there. My husband loves the local drink Mamajuana and purchased bottles on the beach for 14.00 each (they were 18.00 each in the gift shop and 26.00 at the airport).Excursions: Last year we took the Outback Safari and had a fantastic time. It was a great trip with learning about Dominican culture, trips to the cocoa and coffee plantations and boogie boarding/swimming on a private beach area (lots of rum included). We have also been to Saona Island. It was a long and bumpy bus ride but well worth the trip for the catamaran, private island, speed boat trip back with a stop in a shallow part of the ocean to see starfish and a relaxing day. This year we went on a zipline excursion in the mountains which was great fun even though I am afraid of heights. We also went to Altos De Chavon/La Ramona this year. It was most of the day on a bus, a lunch on the Chavon river on a boat, a tour of the Caves of Wonder and a stop at the Altos De Chavon Ampitheater ( the Pete Dye golf course Teeth of the Dog is also here). The trip was too much time on a bus, I would not recommend it.Children: I do not have any children so my tolerance for them is on the low side. I can say that there were children there but they did not bother us at all. The kid's club keeps them busy in the day and I did not notice any acting up at dinner. I cannot vouch for the pool because we spent most of our time on the beach.Entertainment: The evening shows were entertaining but this is not a broadway show. We laughed alot! There are plenty of things to do in the daytime with volleyball and various games/contests organized by the entertainement team. We were there to relax so we did not participate but if you get bored here it is not for lack of activities. There are even spanish lessons and latin dance lessons. There is a disco that opens at 11:00PM. The music is good but it takes a while to get the place going (things start getting good around 12:30-0100AM).I hope this review was helpful. We are already planning our next trip! Please contact us if you have any questions.

<Content>Great Vacation! 5 of us just returned from Bavaro. Jan 16 Thru 23. I can't say enough about this resort. The grounds were absolutely georgous! The staff was the best! The food was good. We only did one reservation and that was the Steak House. It was great.You'd have to be pretty picky to not find something at the buffet you'd like, you certainly won't go hungry!! The ocean was so beautifully blue, the sand so white and soft. The beaches were clean. The flea market up the beach was a riot!! Be sure to barter with those guys, you'll have a ball! Our room was cleaned each day. No musty smell as reported in other reviews. The shows, no not broadway, but certainly entertaining especially when you see the staff that put in 16 hour days up there doing they're best to entertain you. Check in was a breeze. They had a real nice cocktail party for repeat Iberostar guests. We recieved a bottle of rum, plate of fruit and a T-shirts as gifts. It rained a few of the days, but only briefly. If you're going over superbowl sunday, take your team jersey's. The sports bar broadcast the games for you and you'll have a blast! These people work so long and so hard, so tip, tip, tip!! Star Friends are great, Henry, Wilson, Yoanna, Leonardo and Fernando!! Would we go again? In a heartbeat!!Will gladly answer any questions!!

<Content>A great place to relax and do nothing! :) Just got back from a short 4-day stay at the Iberostar Bavaro (Jan 18-21). My husband and I left the kids at home with their grandparents and were able to really relax on this trip!Overall we had a great time! The only negatives that we found were a lack of hot water (though the shower did get warm after about 10 minutes, if you want to wait) and a mildew-y smell in our room initially, which seemed to totally dissipate within a few hours of our arrival.Otherwise we found the resort much as the other reviewers have mentioned - very clean, friendly staff, beautiful grounds, fresh food, etc.! ACCOMMODATIONS - We had a room with a king-size bed, it was fine. Nice thick pillows (maybe they got new pillows? I know other reviewers complained about this) and bed was fine. Hey, it's a hotel bed, what do you expect? I was surprised to find ashtrays in the room but when we called the lobby they said that all of their rooms are the same (i.e. they don't have non-smoking rooms) - but we didn't notice a smoky smell at all (we're both non-smokers). We left little $2-$3 gifts for the maid and our room was cleaned and fridge was stocked every day before 2pm. She also decorated the bathroom every day with little orange flowers, which was a sweet touch. The patio area was cozy and nice and we enjoyed lounging out there. FOOD - I know other people have been disappointed with the food, but we were pleased with the dozens of options at every meal. And yes, some of the buffets were the same at meal after meal, but you can't eat everything in one sitting anyway so we didn't find it to be a problem. I should add that I'm a vegetarian and was concerned about getting enough to eat. But, luckily, there were plenty of fresh fruits and veggies and breads and pastas, etc. The only thing that I found lacking was non-meat protein, but then I don't think tofu is a big local favorite (haha) so I wasn't too surprised. They served beans  rice at a few meals and there was always plenty of cheese, milk, yogurt, etc. so I could get my protein with those foods. I wanted to mention this in case other vegetarians were curious, since I couldn't find any info about this before we went.  DRINKS - Here's a little tip that my husband discovered....the lobby bar at the Iberostar has top shelf liquors out in plain sight. Most of the other bars appear to only have more generic brands, however it seems that they just keep the top shelf stuff out of sight, so you just need to ask for them. He drank Dewer's scotch at almost every bar we went to. So it's worth asking if you prefer a more top shelf liquor (and who doesn't?). I was happy to find that we could get plenty of non-alcoholic frozen drinks and juices, which was nice if you didn't want to start drinking alcohol at 10am.BEACH - The beach was a dream. Soft sand, warm water, plenty of lounge chairs and available palapas, and a nice breeze so we never felt too hot. I was surprised at how rough the surf was at the beach, but that's compared to my last experience in the Caribbean (in Aruba) where the water is almost completely still and you can just float all day. The ocean water here was more like a mellow day on the Atlantic coast.POOL - The pool area seemed consistently more crowded than the beach but we always managed to find chairs at the pool, too. My only complaint was the number of whining 2-year-olds at the pool....I left my kids at home for a reason! Some parents seemed to just ignore their kids but most were courteous and got crying babies and toddlers away from the pool area pretty quickly. I was really surprised at the number of families with small children, but most were well-behaved so I can't complain. ENTERTAINMENT - The shows were packed every night, though we never sat down through a whole show since we just wanted to explore everything. But people certainly seemed to be getting into it and having fun! We spent some time in the casino (fun, but after 15 minutes you've sort of seen it all) and went to the sports bar (Star Rock Cafe) to watch NFL football playoffs. It was packed with rabid football fans so that was a lively crowd, to say the least! OVERALL - It was a great trip and we would go back. Just remember that you are on vacation and relax, have fun, and don't sweat the small stuff! :)

<Content>Loved (almost) everything It was our first time at all inclusive hotel. Wonderful experience.It felt great just to lay back and do nothing.  The weather was awesome, the ocean was very warm, much warmer than the pool:) and the beach was extremely clean. The staff was very nice and friendly, especially at the Kids Club and Diving Center. Food was good, I'm a picky eater but I'm sure everyone can find what he loves. I loved freshly made tropical smoothies and soft cheeses. On New Year Eve they served caviar, lobsters and crabs and champagne for breakfast on January 1st:) Rooms was ok, not well furnished but clean. Pillows are horrible! Bring your own if you can. I will definitely come back to Dominican republic and this hotel - and very soon:) V., Princeton, NJ

<Content>VERY Disappointed We have been to the Iberostar Bavaro approximately 15 times in the last few years and we were never disappointed. This trip was the exception. Our arrival was delayed by 1 day due to the airlines so we phoned ahead to make sure the Iberostar would save our rooms and we were assured that would be no problem. When we arrived, Dec. 2, 2007 we were given inferior bungalows. The shower doors were broken and dangerous. . glass doors hanging by a hinge. We requested two new bungalows (side by side - which was our original request)......Subsequently we were provided with two new bungalows - about a block apart. One bungalow was right next to a construction site and every morning we were woken up with banging and machinery which was awful. The view was that of workmen doing construction; I had requested an ocean view - what a joke. I really was looking forward to this particular vacation. . and truly feel cheated; my past experiences were wonderful..... but after this atrocity, I doubt I will return to this establishment.

<Content>Not a big fan of iberostar bavaro Before I start, keep in mind that I've been to the Grand Palladium and the Moon Palace in Riviera Maya, Mexico.I went Jan 2-9 and it was nice to get away from the cold Chicago weather.Room: decent size, no jacuzzi, hard bed and pillows - recommend bring your own pillows. No real dresser and safe was included for apple customers.Food: didn't care much for the buffett restaraunts, the cajun, steakhouse, and mexican were good - top sirloin was good at the steakhouse. guacomole was so-so and the chips were from a bag, not made there (disappointing). Sometimes we had to ask several times just to get a coke or other drink.Pool: small and dirty.Beach: nice beach and pretty ocean water, but lots of kids.Beach activities: volleyball was great, played 2-3 hours/day. We did the free kayaking, it was fine except the boats that pull people on rafts are flying by you all the time and so are the parasailing boats. One boat swerved through us and the rafters ran us over, and the guy driving the boat thought it was really funny and kept driving.Service: Beware Dominican time. If someone tells you 5 minutes, it's usually a 1/2 hour. One time we showed up at the service counter to sign up for an a la carte dinner at 3PM because teh sign said they'd be back at 3. The line got long an by 3:20, someone complained. By 3:30, a woman came strolling out and had a look on her face that let us know we were bothering her. Room service had a variety to chhose from, but were not flexible AT ALL.Night shows: not good, I liked 1 in the 7 nights we were there.Kids: seems very kid friendly, we didn't care too much for it though since we were on our honeymoon.Recommendations: I would say to go to Riviera Maya Mexico instead - it comparable in price and you get more for your $$. This might be a good resort for someone that's never done all inclusive before, but it was a step down for us since it was our 3rd all inclusive.

<Content>Got Married at Iberostar Bavaro! My husband and I exchanged vows at Iberostar Bavaro Nov 3, 2007. We were there for a week and the entire experience was great. The food and entertainment was very nice and the beach was fabulous. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our room was always clean and they were very accommodating to anything we needed. The resort is so beautiful!!!!!! There are a lot of actives so I think there is something for everyone.The wedding was very nice and the Coordinator, Raiza, was so easy to work with. 30 people attended the wedding so we went there a week before to make sure everything was planned out. There were a few small things that we had issues with, but things come up when you are planning a wedding. We got married at the Gazebo and it was so beautiful! We had a reception, DJ and a formal Steak dinner. Our guest had a blast and I would recommend getting married there.The only issue I had didn鈥檛 have anything to do with the resort. We shipped some items (guest gifts) through UPS and they held them at customs for over two weeks. I shipped them early to avoid this issue and hey still held them for no reason. If you have to ship something DO NOT USE UPS. It was a bad experience. Luckily I had a box of guest gifts that I took on the plane with me, so that worked out ok.

<Content>I've Seen Better This was the first time my fiance, his mother and father, two sisters, and my brother have been to a resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The travel agency we booked with, FunJet, rated the hotel as five star - but I would give it the equivalent of two stars. All the rooms open to the outside - which is typical of central American resorts, so that was fine; however, the views were terrible. They have the balconies face each other instead of the ocean. The room had a small bathroom with very old fixtures. The hair dryer couldn't even dry my hair. I would definitely recommend bringing your own shampoo, conditioner, and hair dryer. The bed was extremely uncomfortable, and I had to put pillows under my body to make it seem like I wasn't sleeping on the floor. Don't expect to watch too much TV either, as it is very small and only provided 5 US stations. There was only a closet - no dresser - to store clothes, and the hangers were the kind where you have to detach the hanger part (ie - it was a pain to hang clothes). This was an all-inclusive resort, but the food and drink were terrible. We have been to other resorts, and they are generous with liquor and the food was good. This place not only used generic, cheap liquor, but they were very stingy with their pours. The food was also terrible. They consistently overcooked all the meats and fishes. The foods are more for a European audience (ex: hamburgers for breakfast) than American. We tried to go outside of the resort and look at some of the country side. We asked how much it would be to rent a car and the front desk told us $100. While we were on our way to the airport - I saw a sign that said we could rent a car for $45. This country tries to sneak as much money away from Americans as they can. Lastly, I had an accident while kayaking and ended up breaking my nose (yep - it broke!). We had to go to two emergency rooms and a follow-up visit. This country wants Americans for their money. They first asked for our passports, then where we were staying. Only after they received that information would they charge us for the treatment, X-ray, etc. They charge based on nationality and how much they think you have - not fair pricing. When we tried to dispute a ridiculous charge, they basically had a guard (with a gun) hold us and force us to sign the credit card slip (which is not illegal to not sign). My recommendation is to never go to the Dominican Republic ever again. The country is just trying to take as much money as they can from Americans and tourists in general.

<Content>!st time at Iberostar - Bavaro Our family of 7 just returned from a 7-day vacation at the Bavaro resort. We have 5 children aged 19 (m), 17(m), 12(f), 11(f) and 5(f). I have to say that each one of them had their own unique experience and all thoroughly enjoyed the vacation. Two of the children have medical conditions, one with type-I diabetes and the other growth hormone reliant. Lets start from the beginning.We left on-time from JFK airport in NYC. This was my first time travelling out of JFK and I must admit, the ride into the airport from New Jersey was not fun, but it is a MUCH better managed airport than Newark is. We were treated very well by our Delta airlines representative and our baggage was swiftly handled. Security was the usual nightmare, but we got through with little difficulty, except for our one daughter with diabetes. It seemed her insulin pump set off the metal detector and she had to be placed into this bulletproof box...LOL you should have seen her, this 11-year old standing in a clear box....Our flight left on time and arrived on time with no problems, and the Delta flight crew was very nice.OK, now onto our arrival. The Punta Cana airport is a small but beautiful airport. It looks like a grass hut. You will have to walk down stairs to exit the plane, but this was nice since they use both the front and rear of the plane. You will walk on the tarmac to the airport structure, there are plenty of workers to direct you. Be prepared to have your picture taken with local models upon entering. There is really no way I saw to avoid it. Make sure you have your immigration form FILLED out and $10.00 us currency for EACH member entering the country. They will give you a small ticket you must hand over to an agent after going through customs. You will be given ANOTHER form to fill out PRIOR to being allowed into the country, make sure this is filled out PRIOR to getting to the customs window. This was a real hassel, but we tried to remember that we were beginning our vacation. Once past customs, it was very easy to find our baggage claim area and our bags were waiting. A bellhop helped us through the inspection area and onto our Pierto Tour representative. We booked a private shuttle from the airport instead of going on the standard bus. As it turned out we were given a bus, just for the seven of us. The hotel complex is more than about 10-minutes away as we were led to believe. You quickly realize that you have left the United States when you see how they drive in the D.R.When we arrived at the Bavaro, the staff removed our bags and we were sent to the registration desk and promptly registered. We were given a nice cool fruity drink while we waited. We were given two rooms #1277 and 1278. These rooms were on the far South portion of the property, next to some adjoining construction. At first we were concerned about noise generated by the construction, but found out that apparantly the project has stalled and were were not disturbed in the least. We were one unit back from the beach.Rooms: The rooms were very nice. The air conditioning work and there was a ceilling fan. The beds were confortable and clean. The in room safe worked perfectly. The bathrooms were very clean. We were on the second floor, so we experienced no problems with ants. We had a small balcony which over looked the interior of the complex with green grass and palm trees. The rooms come with a Wet Bar. This is not the case. The wet bar is nothing more than a refrigerator filled with soda, water and bahamaian beer. Ours did not work very well, and the beer is not very good.Grounds: The grounds at the Bavaro are the most beautiful and clean I have ever seen. I have been to the Bahamas, Antigua and St. Lucia. They all pale in comparision to Bavaro. We constantly saw workers cleaning and grooming the grounds. There was never any litter to be found. Beach: The sand is like nothing I have experienced before. It is truly like powder. Like baby powder is the only way to describe it. There were palm trees on the beach with grass umbrellas to sit under. Dont wair too long into the morning to reserve your lounges. We had the kids go out by 10 am everyday and had no problems. Water: What can you say about the Carribean. Crystal clear, numerous fish to be seen (we would feed them some bread or some patatas fritas - french fries and they would jump out of the water to get them). There were gentle waves and the girls loved riding a tube on them. (bring one if you can).Pools: We went to the pool everyday. The Main pool has a swim up bar, but is not rowdy. The pool slopes gently so that youngsters can walk in. The pool was clean and just the right temprature. Getting a lounge here proved to be a struggle at times, but generally we always found several that were free.There were many peacocks walking around, and they will eat out of your hand (popcorn). We got many pics of them. Food: The food was ok at the buffet. As an American I needed to remind myself that I am not in America.... I found the morning buffet to be adequate, but I am not of a breakfast person as it is. If you arise before 10 am, there is a better buffet just off the lobby, which we went to once. The food there was better, but the best thing is they serve FRESH orange juice there. The later buffet serves some type of frutas, or fake juice.Lunchs we ate generally at the buffet near the pool. They would have hamburgers (not american...lol) hot dogs, but we found the small sandwiches the best. Dinners:We ate at the Steakhouse, Couples, the Meditrainian and the japanese resturants.Steakhouse: We made reservations the morning of our second day for all our dinner reservations. The Steakhouse was tasty. My steak was cook just right and was seasoned very well. We found that there was plenty of food and skipped dessert because we were too full.Mediterrainian: Was seafood and was very good. Lobster, shrimp etc. I love seafood so I was very pleased.Couples: This is the couples only resturant. We found this one to be a little bit disappointing. We were seated promptly, but service was very slow, even realizing we were in the Dominican Republic. My dinner was good, my wife ordered the shrimp and rizzoto dinner. The shrimp were way way over cooked and they served about two tablespoons of rizzoto. The wine here was exceptionally better than any of the other resturants. We complained about my wifes dinner and requsted a plate of rizzoto, which came out quickly and was delicious. We met with the chef and conveyed our thanks. He was very appreciative.Last is the japanese resturant. I thought it would be like a Benihana style resturant where they cook in front of you and put on a small show. It is not like that. They do not cook in front of you, but the food was very good. We were encouraged to make our dinner reservations very early into our vacation, however we never observed any line at any of the resturants. I cant believe that a person could not walk up and requst to be seated.If you like wine..... prepare to be disappointed. We like a good wine, both white and red. You will not find it here. Stick to champagne and you will be fine.Activities: There are many many opportunities to get involved witht the Star Players. Volleyball, pool volleyball, bocce, horseshoes, archery, bb gun shooting, spanish lessons, stretching, dancing lessons, and our favorite BINGO. There were arm wrestling and beer drinking contests also. (I won the beer drinking contest...lol). Or you can do nothing... swim at the pool, rest on the beach or float in the ocean. We got involved a a couple of things, but this vacation for us was more of trying to relax and recharge the batteries.We enjoyed the open bars, although trying to find something good to drink was a challenge. I stuck mainly to the local beer ( which is the only thing they serve) and had no problems. My wife tried the vodka and was disappointed. The rum was not much better, so she stuck with champagne and was not disappointed. At the main bar in the lobby you can find brand name liquors, but not at the pool or beach bars. That was a big disappointment, but we are on vacation.I have kind of rambled on here... but my overall evaluation of the Bavaro resort is OUTSTANDING. The deameanor of the staff and the cleanliness of the grounds far out weigh the fact they had yucky vodka. We would definitely return to Punta Cana. As far as retuning the the Bavaro, we are undecided. For the cost of the vacation, we might do just as well at a three star location.

<Content>Great Honeymoon! My wife and I spent a week at the Iberostar Bavaro Dec. 16-23. The property was in fantastic shape and the beach was amazing!! The rooms were very nice, ours was newly remodeled with a separate seating area, a very nice bathroom, and a surprisingly comfortable bed. I have stayed at All-Inclusives before and I will say that the buffet food was very similar to my previous experiences. Some of it was excellent, some not as much. We did like the fact that they always had meat and vegetables fresh off the grill along with the other standard fare. As for the sit down restaurants, they were AMAZING!! We ate at the Cajun, Japanese, Gourmet, and the American Sports bar. The food was great, service was good at all of the restaurants (absolutely unbelievable at the Gourmet), and the atmosphere was very nice. The Gourmet and the Japanese food was as good as any I have eaten in the U.S. We spent our days lounging on the beach, snorkeling right off of the beach (very nice), eating, drinking, bartering at the shops on the beach and generally enjoying the gorgeous weather (Sunny and mid 80's every day of our trip). At night we always enjoyed our dinners, spent a couple of nights at the shows, relaxed at the Sports bar (I needed my football fix), and dancing at the night clubs. A few things to keep in mind:Not a lot of site seeing to be done off of the resort. We did not do any of the excursions, but those we talked to who did were generally disappointed.Topless sunbathing is accepted and the females that partake range from young and beautiful to old and large. By the end of the trip you will not even notice it!The night life is very tame compared to other destinations. A little bit of Spanish goes a long way in making friends and getting exceptional service from the staff. Overall we couldn't have asked for a better honeymoon! I would recommend the Iberostar Bavaro for young and old alike!

<Content>Great Stay! 12 of us just returned form Christmas stay at the iberostar Bavaro. All of us would be more than willing to return. The D.R. seems to be a very good value compared to others. Plusses: Staff was very nice,beach is awesome--all the hotels are set back and only two stories so all one sees is palm trees and beach chairs for miles in either direction. The water and sand are gorgeous. The hotel strained a bit during Xmas week but still the service was very good and we always could find chairs by the beach and pool and even a palapa. During the rest of the year, it must really be a dream. The food was very good for a buffet. The rooms were large and comfortable-mattresses firm butnot hard. Nice balconies overlooking the gardens,peacocks etc. The landscaping is lush and immaculate. The pool is large and nice. We took a $39 snorkel trip which was good tho not spectacular. The Hobie Cats are fun. The shows were of a professional quality, mostly latin music. Negatives: the wine was Spanish Swill. The liquours and beers good but not top shelf. The theater was open air so rooms near the main building were noisy up until midnite. the maids yell a lot so wake people up in the morning, which possibly may be their purpose. The restaurant reservation system was cumbersome and inefficient sincethere were many open tables at supposedly sold out places. Tipping is very appreciated. The overall hassle factor is zero. One can negotiate the grounds even if partially handicapped-otherwise bring a wheelchair since there are no shuttles (one has to call for the bellman and wait- which we had to do to go to the Dominica next door for the casino--its a ten minute walk.) We booked thru Vacation Store Miami which I would not particularly recommend. The transfers were a hassle. The construction next door was apparently shut down for the holidays.  this is our second iberostar stay-very pleased with them--this one is somewhat better than the Playa De Carmen in every way except that there one can take excursions whereas Punta is somewhat isolated. Havefun!

<Content>Disappointing stay from Dec 20-27, 2007 I am going to keep this review simple. We have traveled a lot and have stayed at several all-inclusive resorts in addition to cruising. I must say that our expectations were not met. Beach was amazing, average quality snorkeling right in front of the hotel.Hotel grounds are expansive and well groomed, however it is a long walk to anywhere. The roaming peacocks were beautiful.Food was poor, in fact, one of our family members was taken by ambulance to the hospital and hooked up to I.V. the last day of our holidays and we were uncertain if she would be able to fly home with us. Flies were abundant in all food service areas; not just open air spaces.Drinks were marginal unless you ordered beer. They were way too strong and I am Canadian, we like a strong drink. The frozen drinks were all from slushy machines and very sweet. Check-in...smooth except that out of the group of 12 travellers and 6 rooms, 8 of us had to be moved the next morning because of the strong smell of sewer disinfectant/deodorizer  three rooms because there was no air conditioning. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but we didn't get any sleep that first night. Packing up and moving rooms cost us a lot of vacation time. Our replacement rooms were new, spacious and comfortable without any unpleasant odors and air conditioning was fully satisfactory.Towels. In order to get a towel you either had to produce a towel card or another towel. So if you happened to forget your towel card in your room, you had to walk back to your room or go without. This is the last thing you should be worried about on a vacation.Entertainment was enthusiastic but lacking substance. Good family fare I suppose.Excursions, we only took one, Marinarium (snorkeling with nurse sharks and rays). Very poor. Snacks were build your own sandwiches out of dry bread, piece of cheese and ham. Mustard Mayo and Ketchup via squeeze bottles. Snorkeling was better at the hotel. What a disappointment for $83 per person price tag. No fins so it was hard to swim because you are always fighting the current and waves. We expressed our disappointment respectfully, and they did make amends by giving each couple a bottle of rum.Diving, weather conditions were poor for diving so no fault to Dressel Divers, the sites were limited. Professional and very accommodating staff. Four stars to the Dive Shop! We ended up coming away with a credit for dives that were paid for in advance but were unused due to conditions. Staff were friendly, and responded well to any attempt you made to communicate with them in Spanish. We left the Dominican Republic with disappointing reviews of our hotel but with lots of fond memories of vacationing with family and friends. We will continue to travel and it is unlikely that we will return to the Dominican unless they produce a good 5* quality resort like a Sandals property.

<Content>Long Review--Great Stay I'll start out my review with the bad. Only two things, and neither of which was the resorts fault:1. The weather. Tropical Storm Olga came up in the middle of our stay, which kept us off the beach more than we wanted to be (but there were ice storms back home, so a tropical storm was the lesser of two evils)2. Lack of parenting. I was shocked at how some parents seemed to think that being on vacation also meant that they were also taking time off from their jobs as parents. 1)One night, at one of our reserved dinners (Japanese), a couple with two children had one set up playing in the aisle where the waiters had to STEP OVER THEM WITH TRAYS OF FOOD, HOT COFFEE, ETC. while their other child ran circles around the restaurant. This happened from the time we had our appetizers until our desert when a couple shushed the child as he ran by their table and he went crying to mommy who gave the couple an evil glare. (If the couple that finally shut this child up is reading this I want to thank you again). This also happened a couple of nights at the bar. Later in the evening, kids were running around playing tag and mowing over cocktail waitresses and other patrons. 2) Our last 3 mornings we were woken up to screaming. When I walked outside the first morning to see what was going on, I saw a young child (2-3 years old) screaming at a peacock. Then getting closer and screaming again. When I walked outside he was about 3 feet away from it. No parents to be seen. If I had been the peacock, I would have flogged him. The next morning he was out there doing it again to ducks. The third morning we woke up to screaming I stayed inside and hoped that he was doing it to a gator or some other animal with large teeth and an appetite. I realize that we didn't book at an adults only resort, but a majority of the children weren't a problem. These were both situations that could have been harmful. The birds there are wild animals and even though they are around people on a regular basis does not mean that they won't attack when being provoked. And the restaurants/bars are not places to play. If a kid runs into someone carrying a tray full of heavy plates of hot food or pots of hot coffee, they're going to get hurt plus have the potential to hurt someone else. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, onto the good stuff...Buffet Food--Much better than I was expecting. There were some staples that were available every day--pasta, burgers, hot dogs, etc. And other things that would rotate each day. I'm a very picky breakfast eater, and don't like most of the traditional breakfast foods and had a full plate (and stomach) each day. And there were eggs and ham and omelets, etc. for all of you breakfast lovers too. Juices out of the juice machine tasted watered down, but anything on the juice bar was fantastic--watermelon juice was delicious. Reservation Food--We made reservations for the Cajun, Mediterranean and Japanese restaurants plus had a romantic dinner at the Gourmet. All were great. I can't really pick a favorite. But it is probably between the Japanese and Cajun. Sickness--I had a couple of days of small stomach aches, but nothing that couldn't have been contributed to drinking all day the day before. Have some bread and bloody marys for breakfast and you're fine to drink for another full day :) Also, the food there is not greasy. So after a week of eating no grease, getting a greasy burger on your layover back home isn't the best idea. I took a whole medicine cabinet worth of drugs with me (immodium, pepto, etc) and the only things I really used were some tums, a couple of bandaids and aloe gel. But I still think it's a good thing to be prepared :) Drinks--I'm normally a dark beer drinker, but the two beers that they had available were much lighter than I normally drink. Not bad. Just not my style. I started out each day with a couple of bloody marys, which were made with Stoli. On one of the cold, stormy nights I stuck with coffee and Frangelico. None of the liquors seemed to be bottom shelf. The rum was all brands that I'd never heard of before, but that was because they were local. I stuck with frozen drinks for the most part. The banana daquiri was delicious and probably my favorite :) We brought our bubba kegs and had no problem getting them filled up. Tropical Storm Olga--This came through and caused us to be completely off the beach and out of the pools for one whole day and many parts of 2-3 more days. The way the staff handled this situation was excellent--there was a lot of things going on in the lobby. Room service was fast (even though everyone must have been ordering it on those stormy days). We stayed in for most of the day, but later saw that there was constant entertainment going on in the lobby and wished that we had got out of the room sooner. Watersports/Excursions--We wanted to take an excursion to the shipwreck for snorkeling. Unfortunately every day that we were there was a red flag day and we weren't able to use any of the diving gear that we had brought along with us or take out the catamarans or kayaks or anything. Rooms--We had a slight beachy smell to the room, I had brought lysol, febreeze and dryer sheets to combat the odors that I had read about, but the smell really wasn't bad. We tipped the maid about $5 a day. They kept the fridge stocked with water, soda and beer. The first day there our hot water didn't work but that was fixed by the time we showered the next day. We took a power strip and 3-prong adapter to keep our batteries  phones charged. There was a hair dryer in the bathroom (which came in helpful for drying clothes). We didn't need to pay for the safe or the remote like I had read in some previous reviews. There was a dispenser of shampoo and shower gel in the bathroom. The maids didn't come at the same time every day--sometimes they were early and sometimes they were there very late in the day, around 4pm. Phone Service--Cingular/ATT worked. Sprint was splotchy. Remember to dial a 1 before the number to call the US. My phone doesn't store phone numbers with the 1+, so my first attempt at a phone call had me worried that neither of us would have service in case of an emergency. Smokers--After reading that smokers were everywhere on some of the previous reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. I don't smoke and being closed up in a room full of smokers bothers me. Fortunately, the open air atmosphere made the air easier to breath. (We had a smoker in our party and when she would smoke at the same table I was at, I wouldn't have even known she was smoking if I didn't see the cigarette in her hand). The only place that I noticed a heavy cloud of smoke in the air was the disco. Disco  Star Rock Cafe--We explored these on our last night there. The star rock had a lot of tv's and we wished we would have thought to look into it earlier and see if they had any football or hockey games playing. Pool tables, air hockey and foosball tables were inside. The disco played a lot of 80's pop music. The bar was made from airplane wings. The DJ booth was a cockpit. Neat place, but smoky. Staff--they were wonderful! Always friendly. The bathrooms were always clean. The property was always well maintained. Even during the storm there were workers keeping branches and palm leaves off of the walkways. The wait staff was quick to refill your drinks or take plates that you were done with. Star friends came to the beach to round you up for games. Bingo was different than what we are used to, but still fun. Cautions--Sidewalks are SLICK when wet. Be careful! Take sunscreen with a higher SPF than you would normally use and remember to reapply. It's no fun to be in paradise with a sunburn and not want to go outside. Additional Advice--I had originally read to pack and then unpack half, since you'd spend most of the days on the beach and only needed to dress for dinner. I wish that I had taken more clothes. I had several mix and match outfits, where 3-4 skirts and 3-4 tops would last for the whole 7 night trip. Unfortunately, with the tropical storm that blew in, my clothes got soaked every night and sometimes weren't all the way dry before the next time I wore them out. The way the wind was blowing an umbrella wouldn't have kept me dry. But more clothes would have been nice. Let me know if you have any other questions!

<Content>Recent trip from New York From AK(New York)December 9 2007-December 16 2007Stayed with my wife and daughter in that top Iberostar resort - there are 3 together, Iberostar Punta Cana, Dominican and Bavaro.Suites that are promised - really larger loft type rooms with a smal terrace. Was raining most of days - tropical storm Olga visited for 36 hours and our suite was flooded badly, and was flooded almost everytime it rained. Beach is OK, but not as calm as on the LaRomana side. Food was ok, some nights we had variety - like lobsters and etc. kids club was too far in the next Iberostar hotel and we did not see any activities for kids and no entertainment team on the beach, beach towels where not available few times for all guests, had to wait for the fresh once. Overall - it was a good vacation, service was good, food - OK, but not 6 golden apples. would not come back and recomment Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus in LaRomana, except if you are fying in Santo Domingo there is a 2 hr drive on crazy roads with crazy driver to La Romana - the only downside:-)

<Content>Great Hotel, Boo Tropical Storm Olga Stayed at The Bavaro Dec. 8-15 just in time for tropical storm Olga. More on that later. This was my 2nd trip to this hotel. I had previously stayed at Iberostar Punta Cana and I liked the Bavaro better by far. I was surprised to see the condition that the Punta Cana and Dominican were in compared to the Bavaro. Our room was not ready when we checked in. We were in 2597 which was close to the buffet and we wanted closer to the beach so after the 1st night were moved to 2416. The only bad thing about this was it's first floor location. I prefer 2nd. It was right by the pool and with all the rain we had our deck was soaked most of the time and the seat cushion was wet. Also the peacocks love to lay on the seat cushions of the 1st floor rooms which was really yucky. Sunday and Monday were very windy. Difficult to sit on the beach because of the blowing sand. On Tuesday Olga rolled in and it poured all day. Pool and beach closed so we headed to the bar where we met some really great people. My favorite bartender was Danilo. The staff is all great. Very friendly and always a smile to greet you. We did take about $100 in $1's for tips and they are very appreciative when you do give them something extra. Since I had stayed there previously we were invited to a special cocktail reception Tuesday night and had a group picture takenand were given t-shirts. Loved haggling with the vendors on the beach. The Buffet was excellent. I know I gained a few pounds. Also ate at Japanese restaurant which was probably my favorite, Gourmet which was ok and Steak house which was good. The whole place was decorated for Christmas and the palm trees were all wrapped in lights which was very beautiful. Did the Outback Safari which I had done before and it is excellent. I would highly recommend it. Sammy was our guide and Cesar was the driver. Both awesome in their knowledge of the Dominican. The only negative that I had was the rooms were not made up most days until 4 or so. We had to call on two different occasions. Other than that, it was all good even with the weather and I would definitely go back...

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro This is my 2nd trip to the Iberostaar Bavaro and my wife and I loved it as much this time as we did the first time. The food is UNBELIEVABLE!!! I am a New Yorker living in NYC and I have eaten in New York's finest restaurants so if I am saying that the food at the Bavaro is great then you know from where the critique is coming. I just can't for the life of me understand how anybody from anywhere can have anything bad to say about the food!!! But one thing is for certain- NOBODY gets sick from the food (whether or not they like it) and that is a HUGE plus since there are tons of people returning to NYC from the Dominican Republic who have nightmare stories about getting food poisoning. As for the nightly entertainment it is fun. Hey it's not a Broadway show by any means but it's fun. It's like a good high school show with better than High School show dancing. The pool is very nice and the pool bar makes VERY strong drinks so be careful. The beach is pretty. It's hard to find a chair but you will find one. The ocean does not have big waves. It's kind of calm- Not like where I am from in Queens, NY. There are many people from Europe staying at the Bavaro. Mostly from Germany, Belgium,  France. I would say that Americans are in the minority. We found 2other couples from, Baltimore and Philly who we hung out with day and night partying. After the nightly show is over eveybody goes up to the bar in the front lobby and has drinks for a while. Then it's on to the disco for a little partying. If you didn't think there were singles anywhere in the hotel this is where you will find every last one of them. It's a pretty jumping place and crowded too.  At the Bavaro there are 6 restaurants and the Buffet. Earlier when I mentioned the food I was referring to the Buffet. But the restaurant food is even better! Out of the 6 we love 2 of them- Jambalaya and Gourmet. The hotel staff are the nicest people you will EVER meet! When I came to Bavaro the first time I thought they were faking it because being from NYC I couldn't imagine people being so kind but they truly are lovely people and it makes the trip that much better. All you see all week are smiles and Hola's. We paid around $113 per person($226 for my wife and I) per night. For this price where on earth can you find anything similar!That does not include airfare. I would be happy to answer any more questions from future trip goers.Benett  Pamela PearlmanWhitestone, New Yorkbenettp@earthlink.net

<Content>Good, but not great. Nice and clean with beautiful pool and beaches. Negatives were construction going on next door that was very loud. The food was below average and the drinks were watered down. The Japanese restaurant was very good. There were not enough lounge chairs around the pool for quality sun space. Leaving the resort seemed very scary as the surrounding area all the way to the airport was very bad. We had a bag with valuables disappear from our room and guest services did not seem very interested in helping. I would recommend using the safe. Not a good destination for singles.

<Content>Another wonderful trip!!!!!! This is our second return trip to the Iberostar Bavaro. We got married there last November (2006) and had 30 guests, this year 20 returned with us. The beaches are fabulous. The staff is magnificent, best service I have ever experienced. Tip: bring trinkets for the maid, waiters, and bar staff (nail polish, t shirts, hats, jewlery) They appreciate it so much, and it is studd you have laying around for years that you will never use. Food is great, the Mediteraenean and Gourmet are tops! Pools are terrific, entertainment is top notch! You will not regret your stay. We plan on returning yearly! We even got free rum, flowers, a private cocktail party, and champagne for being return guests. Just let them know at the front desk! You will be thrilled if you choose this resort. Any bad reveiws you read are from overly picky, spoiled travelers who have never left the states, and expect the food and language to be exactly the same. No one got sick...everyone is returning next year. TRUST ME YOU WILL LOVE IT!

<Content>Love this place!! We first stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro in 2000 with our 2 teenage boys-, 13 and 18. We never once felt that they were unsafe if they were out of our sight. The 3 hotels linked gave them a chance to hang out with other kids and never leave the compound. We have tried other resorts as a couple since then and always seem to be disappointed because we compare them to the Bavaro. This year I said, lets go back to the Bavaro or I'd rather stay at home! We again had the best vacation since our last trip there. The food is wonderful, the staff is very friendly, helpful and very much wants to make your stay a time to remember. The beach and pool are kept spotless and the best snorkeling is actually right off the beach in front of the Bavaro! There is a small reef out there and if you bring bread from the buffet they come out. Fish up to 2 feel long and brilliantly colored, all without signing up for a snorkel adventure. We are completely sold on the Bavaro and will go there every year from now on .

<Content>good, relaxing time just returned from a great week at bavaro. i will start by saying that i booked everything myself (didn't use a travel company.) contacted the airline, transfer company, and hotel all myself. i was pretty nervous about this after i booked it and was reading how just about everyone else on trip advisor used apple, funjet, etc. but, everything went very smoothly. i'm not saying you shouldn't use a travel company, but if you have booked independently like i did, don't worry--hopefully your trip will go like mine and have no bumps in the road.the aiport arrival went smoothly. just follow the crowd, it is pretty self explanitory. we used the silva transfer company, and they were great. very dependable. did everything just the way they said they would. and finally, here are the highlights about the hotel:BEACH--absolutely beautiful. the water really is that turquoise color and the sand is so soft and pretty.POOL--didn't spend much time at the pool, as we were on the beach all day every day, but i can say that it is really pretty, and we did make a stop at the swim up bar everyday. really fun.ROOMS--the rooms were big and comfy. really, really liked the rooms. except, we did have a few ants in the bathroom. wasn't horrible or anything, but definitely would have been more pleasurable if they had not been there.FOOD--before i go on, keep in mind that i am a very picky eater. i was not impressed with the buffets. i did always find something to eat like pizza or sandwiches, but overall i didn't care for the buffets. the food isn't bad, it's just a different taste than i care for. to each his own, i guess. i ended up eating fries and hot dogs at the beach bar a few times, and they were fresh and tasty. room service was ok. i liked their tacos. the al a carte restaurants, however, were delicious. we ate at one every night. just check in at guest service daily between 3 and 4 and they will tell you what reservations they have available for that night. the mediterranean was our favorite, but they are all very good.DRINKS--if you plan on drinking much, definitely bring a bubba keg or insulated cup of some sort. they really helped. everyone was envious of ours.ENTERTAINMENT--we only watched one of the nightly shows, but it was pretty good. corny, but entertaining. we spent a lot of time at the lobby bar. also hit the casino which was small, but fun. and did go to the discotecha. it was really fun, but very, very hot in there. wear light clothes if you go there. also spent time at the star rock cafe watching sports.MISC--definitely take some stomach medicine. we both got a little sick, but i honestly think it was our own fault. eating and drinking too much stuff that we weren't used too and not drinking enough water. i speak hardly any spanish. it wasn't much of a problem. the employees at the resort speak enough english to know what you are needing.we had a great, relaxing, time. i would reccommend this resort. it is a great value for the money.

<Content>Fabulous time at the Iberostar My husband and I had another great stay at the Iberostar Bavaro for 7 days. This was our second trip to the resort and it was a wonderful as the first. Our room was very nice with a king size bed and had just been renovated. We left $2 tips every day for the maid with a list of beverage replenishments and she always left what we ordered. They are still renovating several units as they were during our first stay in April. I did not notice any musty smell but brought along a candle and some glade plug ins just in case. I also packed a night light for the bathroom which was a good idea so that I could see at night. The construction was on the other side of the resort(closer to the flea market) and we did hear the pile driver on occasion when we were at the beach, but never in our room. The food was very good and the Gourmet Restaurant was our favorite. We ate there twice as we had it as one of our 3 guarentees and we also got to sign up for the romantic dinner for 2 which did not count as one of our guarentees. The cajun and Japanese restaurants were other choices and they were good too. The Lobster and Steak night buffet has changed to Friday night. The evening buffets were excellent as were the beach luncheon buffets with all the grill meats and rotisserie chicken. We did venture over to the Dominicana one day for lunch and thought that our lunches at the Bavaro were much better.  The shows at night were not our style although the Variety Show was really good considering. We usually left $1 tips for our drinks, but noticed that the Europeans do not. The Star Friends were also ready to have you join in the fun.  I did have a couple of massages. I tried the new India type massage and was disappointed but the deep tissue massage was wonderful. The gym was ok but 2 out of 3 elliptical machines were broken and there was only one treadmill. Here is a tip for your beach palapa. Change your towel the night before and put your towels on the chairs under the palapa you want before you go to breakfast. The beaches were gorgeous and the grounds were immaculately maintained.

<Content>Had a pretty good time over-all at the Bavaro Overall this resort lived up to it's name.One reason I booked this place is because you can go between the 3 resorts if you stay at the Bavaro. I also booked this place because it has 2 story bungalows through-out the resort, not the hotel atmosphere. What I didn't realize was that the bungalows near the back off the property (as ours was) is a long walk to the beach. The walkway winded around the bungalows, not a straight line back. That being that, it was somewhat difficult to find your way back to your room at night, since the buildings were very similar in colors. It took us a couple off days to remember the trail back to our rooms from other sections of the resorts.For my money, it was too far back to keep going back and forth to my room, I'd say a good 300 yards. So when you book, try to get a room closer to the beach. The walkways were made to look like cobble stone roads, a bit hard to walk on and when they got wet, you had a tendancy to slip. I don't know why they came up with this design, but it could be greatly improved, at least level the walkway out. One more thing that I didn't really like about the drinks was that they don't carry much of juices for mixers and the ones that they do carry are watered down about 50%,. so your not really tasting the juice. Even the banana juice was watered down. Although when I asked for more liquer in my drink, they were happy to pour me extra!Unfortunately, this place is European owned and us Americans were the vast minority. Most of the shows were in spanish, and a lot of the help did not speak/understand much English.The vacationing europeans were very rude in that they thought they owned the place. Speaking with other Americans at the bars, I heard the same from them. Only a few that I spoke to would go back because of this.The late night disco catered to younger people, so drinking later on the evening was at the lobby bar with no entertainment. The rooms were perfect and pretty much quiet, no musty smell and the air-conditioning was nice and quiet. Although I found my morning shower water wasn't that hot, but had plenty of pressure. We had no problems with the 24 hour room service and my room was immaculate every time I returned to my room at night. I was very much impressed with the room!I can't say enough about the grounds and foliage, they were beautiful. It was like walkiing around a jungle, with so many varieties for plants all around you. That was the most stunning part of the trip. The wooden walkway through the property was breathtaking, perfect for wedding photos.I also thought that the buffet lunch and dinners were better then most other resorts I have been to. The food was hot, fresh and, had calamari every night prepared in a different way. They did change up parts of the menu so you didn't have to have the same thing each and every day. I'll give the buffet a 4 star rating. We ate at 2 specialty restaurants during or vacation and we loved both meals. The help was extremely polite and catered to our tastes and requests. Too bad they didn't have the Duck when I was there.The beach was one of the cleanest that I have seen. I took several walks down the beach to other resorts and the Iberostar Bavaro had the cleanest. Every morning and possibly twice a day, they are out there cleaning off the seaweed and grooming the beach. Since the place was only about 50% full, we had no problem finding beach chairs.I will consider returning back to the resort, since it was so nicely kept up and newer. BUT, it would be nice to have more English speaking shows and the help could understand English better. If it weren't for some of the non-americans, I would definately return. I'm not into rudeness.Other then that, I was very impressed with the place and would recommend it for fellow travelers.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! Went to Iberostar Bavaro from Nov. 16th to Nov, 21 and had an excellent time. When we got in on Friday it was pouring, The trip to the hotel went pretty smooth. Beware of the airport and the guys wanting to help you with your luggage, Just get your bags and keep on walking. Our ride was ready and waiting for us.The hotel is beautiful. We did ask for an ocean view(or close to it) and we got the furthest room away. Did ask for a joint room and did receive this request. By Saturday morning the sun was shinning and we went down to the pool. Got really involved with the star friends and joined in on alot of the planned activities. They really make you feel welcome. They work hard and do an excellent job.We had no problems with the food. Great selection and we all loved the dinners at night. Went with my husband and 4 children and never once a complaint about not having something everyone liked. Bring lots of sun screen, dollar bills(for tipping), insulated mugs, and an umbrella. One thing I learned also is that they do not have a washer/dryer available. Went to the shows each night and they were OK. This is a vacation go and check it out, enjoy a drink or two! We tried to get late check out but could not. Check out is 12:00 and I needed till 1:00. They did let us use a room that had just a shower, sink and hair dryer to get ready in. It was OK but would have rather been able to finish getting ready in our own room.Would we go back? In a heartbeat!Any questions please let me know.ENJOY!

<Content>"Loved the Iberostar Bavero...Long Honest review" We have just returned from a 7 night stay (Nov. 13th-20th 2007) at the IBEROSTAR BAVERO, all inclusive HOTEL. WE HAD A GREAT TIME. Met some great people. The huge compound is VERY SAFE and the 3 Iberostar hotels are side by side. This review might help you decide if you want to pay a little more for the Ibeerostar Bavero. The discos, cacino, pharmacy are located by thePunta Cana and Dominican Hotels. There appeared to be a younger crowd at these 2 hotels and many of the cabanas on the beach, being used. The grounds were more open, for a different look and were lovely. The spa and exercise area is located in the middle of the 3 hotels. We did not see any of the rooms at the other 2 hotels to compare to, but our Jr. Suite at the IBEROSTAR BAVERO was VERY NICE! Large, comfortable and new looking. The refrigerator was well stocked with water, cold drinks and beer. Your chance of getting an ocean view room at any of the 3 hotels is very rare, because they are leased out. But we were very pleased with our 1st floor room. The grounds are FABULOUS! Especially at the Bavero. The flamingos and peacocks are beautiful. They have extensive water ponds everwhere! We felt that the Bavero was a lttle more upgrade than the other two, but all were very nice. Read many reviews to get a complete picture. YES! They are building a hotel on right side of the Bavero hotel. The Punta Cana and Dominica are on the left side of the Bavaro. It did not bother us, but you might request a room on the quieter side of the Bavero. We loved swimming in the beautiful water and walking on the soft white sand, relaxing under one of the abundant thatched roof cabanas. We were sorry that we had not picked up one of the schedules telling of the different activities that they have going on daily, where you can win a T-shirt, cap or bottle of rum. We finally did take part in the archery,air gun, ping pong, mini golf putting, and bingo tournaments and games. I was tickled that I won an Iberostar T-shirt. The food was good. A lot to chose from. If you like steak, eat it at the Gourmet Restaurant. We loved the Cajun and Japanese restaurants. The food out by the pool was very good, too. Pizzas, hamburgers, hot dogs, Mexican food, fish, salads, ice cream cones and even pop corn. The high like of our trip was the BAVARO RUNNERS Safari excursion in an open bus with side curtains, that we booked at our hotel. There is another excursion where you drive your own jeep. Our guide AROS, really was great! We feel that we have seen and learned a lot about the Dominican Republic and their culture. We felt very safe during our entire excursion. The evening entertainment was enjoyable. It topped off our day. If you are expecting a Broadway show....then you will be disappointed. The STAR FRIENDS and professional entertainers WORK VERY HARD to help make your vacation a success. In the evening they dance with anyone that wants to dance to the great band music. They appear to always be respectful and just want you to have a good time and to help make your vacation a more enjoyable one. I was surprised that they had a kids show at 8:30pm, then adult dancing, then a FUNNY show with people from the audience and end it with a professional floor show. The drinks were good. Some better than others, but they DID AIM TO PLEASE! We did not have a problem with mosquitos, but we met people from another hotel that did. Some people complained about their hotel being old and used. One couple that we met, said that the Iberostar Bavero was the 3rd. hotel hotel since they had arrived in Punta Cana. They said that their other two hotels were rude and unfriendly. There are many nice hotel, just check reviews! At our hotel, everone was very friendly and eager to help. There is one negative. You do a lot of walking, unless you want to call for the golf cart to pick you up or take you anywhere. Of course, eating all the time, the exercise was good for us! Our bungalow was near the beach and pool, which is what we wanted. So, we had a long walk to the main restaurants and lobby. It was the rainy season, during our trip, but after raining cats and dogs, it always managed to turn to sun shine for us to enjoy the beach, which was NEVER muddy. We made it a point to go the beach whenever it was sun shining and do other things when it was not. I hope this review helps and that where ever you stay, that you have as much fun as we did.

<Content>Excellent holiday stayed at this resort nov 1-15,the complex is beautiful nice rooms and staff very friendly.we left a couple of dollars every day for the cleaner and she made sure the fridge was stock up and water . Always a good selection of meals to choose from. The beach with its soft white sands and palm trees are to die for. The weather was great apart from 2 days of rain but,still hot. Entertainment could do with improvement but by 10 pm we were ready for bed.The casino is small and beware the smell of cigarettes hits you as you walk through the door.CONSTRUCTION they are in the process of building a new hotel right next door to this one which will be a iberostar 5+ so expect noise for the next few years,we did not here much noise as they only started as we were about leave.Saona island a must ,fantastic day out and something you will always remember on this holiday.Remember to bring a clock because i could not find one anywhere,it may be a poor country but all the staff carry a cell phone?The only disapointment with this holiday is a 9 hour flight but we beleave it was worth it.We will visit this resort again once work has finished .This hotel is still one of the best and i did take the time to visit some hotels along the beach which i was not impressed with and so,if you can put up with a little noise i am sure you wont be disapointed.

<Content>Best Ever Hotel We have just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro yesterday.This was the best hotel we have ever stayed in and certainly the best Iberostar Hotel.The rooms were excellent, small blocks of 8 rooms so there was plenty of privacy. There was no noise either between the rooms.The food was excellent and plenty of choice every day. Always something going on by the pool bar, either a BBQ or a Coconut party made the atmosphere fun and kept everyone happy.The entertainment was fun too, and I have to say this is probably the best Animation team we have experienced. They were a good team and never pressured anyone into doing anything they didn't want to. For me, the Water Volley ball was ALWAYS entertaining!Beach was lovely, and the sand was beautiful.The pool was great and for the older folks, you are able to walk in to the water (as you would the beach).Good to see the Manager always involved in the running of the events and keeping a close eye on the standards. I really felt that these guys are on the top of their game.Well recommended!If you need any further information, contact m e on andydursley@hotmail.com

<Content>Great time at the Iberostar We just returned from a one week stay nov 16 - 23. We are a family of 4 and met up with my sisters family of 6. Apple couldn't have made it any easier. There was even a rep at our airport in baltimore who ran us down in security because he got us better seats on the airplane.The DR airport is quite nice and we were quickly whisked on a bus to the airport. Check in went smoothly. We requested 4 rooms together and we got exactly what we wanted - half a building 2 up, 2 down.The rooms - quite nice. One room had a musty smell that maintenance came to fix. Our room had no musty smell. If you've ever been to Mexico you know how hard the beds are there. Not here, they were actually comfortable. The food - I was pleasantly surprised. It was much better than I had anticipated. We made 3 reservations, but it was no problem getting reservations the other nights we were there. We ate at the Japanese, the gourmet, the cajun, the mediterranean and the steak house. I didn't like the Japanese restaurant but the kids all said it was their favorite. It wasn't really air conditioned and a few of us spit out shrimp as it tasted spoiled.My favorite was the mediterranean, but be warned they only have fish on the menu. I had a paella with lobster there that was really good. The appetizers were delicious. The gourmet and cajun were really nicely decorated restaurants and so nice to sit in the a/c at night. The steakhouse was also quite good. I didn't think I'd like it as the meat tasted different there from what I imagine is probably just the diet of the cows. It was seasoned and delicious.The beach - the sand feels like corn starch. Clean and white and beautiful. Loads of palapas on the beach and plenty of places to sit around the pool. Word to the wise - get to the beach before 9:30 or 10 to get a decent seat in the shade.2 of the girls spent a lot of time with the kids club coming and going and they had a great time. Keila was great with them. We gave all the kids walkie talkies so they could roam around yet keep in touch. It was extremely handy to have.It is a very international clientele which to me was really fascinating. Hopefully you can speak a little spanish or learn a little there. Most speak english, but it's nice to make the effort. For those with children - the beach has topless women of all shapes and sizes and ages. Having 13 yo boys (and husbands) made for some interesting times. The shows at night were really corny, but the star friends are so happy and enthusiastic you can't help but laugh yourself. Plus you're sitting outside in paradise getting waited on.I didn't see a lot of people tipping there and I noticed no difference in service for tipping or not tipping.They are building a new resort next door. I never heard a sound on the beach. Our rooms were right next to the wall and even then it wasn't that disturbing.The entire family, minus me, went on the ATV trip and had a blast. I got a massage at the beach while they were gone. Having been to similar resorts in mexico - the moon palace in cancun and the riu palace in PDC - it is similar, though I believe the food is better at this resort.

<Content>Best Place Ever, bad casino We spent November 14 - 21, 2007 @ Iberostar Bavaro. Like most of the other reviews say, the place is awesome. It's about 40 minutes or so from the Punta Cana Airport. The resort, itself, is huge. The beach is great. Clean, powdery sand and incredible water. While we were there we had some serious waves, so the kids preferred the kiddie pool or the walk-in pool. It also rained a couple of days, oh well.The room was exactly as other have described, but be careful if you need a 3-prong outlet, the type that laptops use. They don't exist in the roms, so make sure you bring an adapter. The room did NOT smell of anything at all. It was actually one of the best rooms we've had in years and years of travels. The air conditioning was incredible and kept us quite cool!The food was the best we've ever encountered in an all-inclusive resort. Every place we ate (the main buffet, the beach/pool buffet, steak house, Japanese, Mediterranean, and Cajun) had lots of variety and we were very, very happy with each. The main buffet is open until 3am in case you get hungry late and 24 hour room service is included, although we forgot to use it! The waiters/staff everywhere were very attentive and spoke enough English to never have to wait for water or whatever else we needed.The casino was horrible. Worst ever. There's a Texas Hold 'Em table in a corner and no one ever plays. We actually got 4 people together once and played -- so we understood why no one wants to. The minimum buy-in is $100, small blind is $5, and big blind is $10. There's a 5% rake regardless whether there's a flop or not and they round UP to the next dollar. They seem VERY reluctant to get people to play, so this was a one-time thing.Blackjack was the most popular table game by number of players, but here too the casino screwed you in a few ways. First, they deal less than half the shoe (either 8 or 12 decks). So there's a lot of (manual) shuffling. Second, if you get blackjack, you do get paid 3-to-2, buf if your bet was $5 ($12.50 payout), you are FORCED to play a minimum of $7.50 because they CAN'T make change for $5! Third, like in many similar casinos, they don't check their hole card, so if the dealer has an Ace showing, you won't know about it (and neither will they) until everyone's gone through the motions.None of the dealers spoke a lick of English (fine), but they also made countless mistakes (always in favor of the house, so I don't think they were real mistakes) paying-out winners. They were also generally unhappy and never smiled.If you ever run into some drunk, crazy Russians (Stan and Tiger from New Jersey in our case), sit at their table only if you want to have more fun than you've ever had in a casino!

<Content>Honest Review - Loved The Bravaro BUT We stayed at the Iberostar Bravaro Nov 11-18. It rained a lot that week. But we still did have a good time. A couple of nice days of sunshine. On our reservation we put in the comments: Junior Suite by the pool away from the noise. There is a lot of noise next to the construction. We got there and they put us furthest from the pool and closest to the noise. We moved one day later, Betty is great at the service desk. Anyway we have been to 3 Iberostar's this one is very nice. However we like the Mayan in Rivera Maya better. The food was very good they only allow you 3 restaurants for reservations. Book early and go back each day at 2:30-3:00pm to check for cancellations鈥? Friday is the all you can eat lobster. Overall the food was very good. One night we ordered room service pizzas, salad, hamburger, brownie, basic stuff but good. Drinks not really any top shelf liquor. But we found there national drink call mamajwana its very good try some. I drank president beer they have bottled beer also but not at the pool Its OK.... If you only drink bud light or miller you may not like it. If you ask the gardeners or landscape people they will bring you coconuts and take them to the bar and they will fill them with frozen coco locos these are very good. I can't rate the entertainment. or the excursions鈥?we didn't go. We hung out at the beach and pool which are both very nice. Lots of daily activities from staff to make it fun. The grounds and resort are kept very clean. We did go to the casino and the shops. Casino very small, but has enough slots and table games to make it fun. Shopping at beach make sure you deal with these guys. Prices all over the place. A couple of important tips. The do enforce the long pants for men, No shorts at restraants but buffets ok. Ladies can wear just about anything. Bring an extension cord. not a lot of plugs in the room to charge cameras and cell phones. We brought a portable DVD player with a couple of movies. Came in handy when it rained. Bring an alarm clock no rooms have clocks, Tip your maid a couple of dollars each day to get bottled water and pop and beer. we always take $100 us singles. However I don;t think we got any better service than anyone else. The staff is very friendly. We also brought air fresheners for the room from reading these reviews(no need) . Both our first and second room we moved to very nice and clean and did not smell. We did not get sick nor the 4 other couples we were with. I didn鈥檛 talk to anyone that got sick. As far as the people complaining about this place I am not sure what they want but the resort is very beautiful and remember you make your own vacation. My advice to all the nay Sayers this is not the most expensive resort I have ever stayed at. It is also not the best nor worst resort I have stayed at. But for the money we had a lot of fun and got tan even with the rain. I also don't see how you can lose weight here. there is food everywhere. But if you want to really be papmpered go to Secrets Excellance in Rivera Maya but 2x the cost... Have Fun....

<Content>Great hotel, honeymoon, beach, and over a great time. Nov 10-17, 2007 Nov 10-17, 2007This place was one of the best hotels I have spent a vacation at, and believe me I'm a bit of a hotel snob. The food at the buffet was better than any resort I have stayed at in Mexico, and I have stated at plenty. This resort spent a good deal of time and effort in the landscaping, which allowed my wife and me to take over 90 pictures of just the resort. The staff is more than friendly is will to help you out when ever you need it. We were on our honeymoon and the front desk changed our room location from being near the check-in area to stepping distance from the pool/beach for no cost.The main are of the room is very spacious, but the toilet area is fair cramped, in other words if you are a rather large person, you may find it hard to sit with comfort on the toilet. Do be prepared for it to rain everyday, but when the weather is still in the high 80's, one really cannot complain. Take my advice and go to your local dollar store and buy a cheap rain poncho. They are light, inexpensive, will keep you warm, and you can throw it away on your trip home. Things to remember while there, you will have to pay a $10 (per person) tourist fee as you enter the airport. The baggage carriers at the airport are like ants on sugar and will try just grab your bags to carry them for you. Don't rush anything and don't expect others to do so. By the way, bring cheap make-up for the maid. Make-up in Punta Cana is really expensive for those that live there. We brought 3 makeup kits from the dollar store. Not only did we have extra water, but extra towels and pillows without asking for them. The follow tours were NOT worth the price, nor were they all they were advertised to be:Zip line Tour ($89 USD per person): its not a jungle or tree canopy tour. Its zip lining from one man made structure to another in an open clearing in the mountain area. We were told that this was the first zip line tour in the DR. You can really tell it鈥檚 a new tour from all the equipment and the tour structures. It takes about 1 hour to get there. You zip line on 10 lines, once, then back to the truck for another 1 hour trip back to the hotel. On the other hand, the crew is really nice, the equipment is new and in good shape, and your safety is really promoted as being the #1 most important thing while you are there. All in all, this really is a $50 USD trip. Marinarium Shark and Stingray Excursion ($83 USD per person). Not only was there hardly any coral reef in the area, there are no fish. The nurse sharks and the rays are in an underwater cage with you and about 45 other people. The tour does then take you on an awesome tour of the local beach area and then to a swim area that is about 4 feet deep. The staff is really energetic, friendly, and generally seem to want you to have a good time. On the other hand, the tour is not as exciting as it is advertised. This tour should really be about $60 USD per person.Oh by the way, the Apple Rep, Ceasar, will not be any help when you tell them if any of the tours were not what they were advertising them to be. He'll go from friendy guy to why are your still standing in fornt of me guy in about 1 second. He'll also act as if he has something else to do.

<Content>unbelieveable vacation! My boyfriend and I booked our vacation thru Apple Vacations. It's the best way to go! We flew US Airways with a flight change in Charlotte, NC. It was the smoothest trip I've ever been on. We checked in at the airport, both flights to Punta Cana were on time, and the flight was very comfortable. When we arrived, we were escorted to customs, where we had to pay $10 to get into the country, and then had our picture taken with the natives.The shuttle to the hotel was air conditioned, and took about 25 minutes to get there. I've read several reviews regarding the drive to the hotel. The reviews that said drivers are crazy is true. However, our driver seemed to be ok, so it wasn't so bad.As soon as we got to the hotel, we were greeted by the bellhops, who took our baggage and placed it on the steps of the lobby. The lobby is covered, but it is an open air concept. We were led to the check-in desk, where we were greeted with a welcome drink - the bahama mama - which was darn good if you like foofy drinks (which I do). The check in lady gave us an overview of where everything is at the resort, gave us our keys, a map of the resort, and other orientation pamphlets from our apple representative. We never saw our apple representative until 2 days before we left, but he was very nice when we caught up with him. It was raining when we got there, so they had someone drive us with our luggage to our suite on a covered golf cart. Our room was just as it was pictured on the Apple Vacations website. Waiting was a small bottle of rum and a plate of fruit. The purpose of our trip was for pure relaxation. We had no plans to do any excursions unless we decided to last minute. We were there from 10/28 to 11/4. It rained on saturday and all day sunday, so we wandered around all 3 Iberostar resorts, getting the lay of the land. Throughout our stay the service was impeccable, and the Star Friends staff were friendly. They did not harass us when we chose not to participate. As for the food, the buffets were plentiful. The quality was what I expected it would be, but it certainly wasn't terrible. There is enough variety for every taste. Vegetarians might be disappointed, as there were a ton of meat dishes at the buffet, but there was always a salad bar and various sandwiches and pizza. Not a lot of vegetables, though, as side dishes. None of the food is prepared for those that are watching their weight. If you are a meat eater, the veal steaks are incredible! I am a meat eater, however, i certainly don't eat a ton of it at home. Almost every meal I had contained meat....We were able to go to 4 of the specialty restaurants. We went to the Japanese, Cajun (Jambalaya), steakhouse, and gourmet restaurant, which is an adults only restaurant. On Saturdays, the gourmet restaurant is couples only, and the management sends you a formal invitation. When you arrive there, you both are greeted with a glass of champagne, and the women receive a red rose. The food was amazing at all the specialty restaurants we went to. I didn't have an ultimate favorite. The rum down there is different from the rum in the states. It is much stronger. If you have a preference for either light (ron blanco) or dark rum, you need to specify, or they will give you dark rum. Diet coke is called Coca Cola Light. Be sure to specify if you want diet soda, too.Most of the hotel staff speak English, but they do try to speak in Spanish if you can speak the language. We did tip the bartenders, waitstaff at the specialty restaurants, and the housekeeping staff. We didn't find any preferential treatment in doing so, but we did it anyway.The only excursion we went on was the 1/2 day shopping excursion. We went to a cigar factory, where they hand roll all cigars. Then we went to the rum factory. We were disappointed because they really didn't show us how the rum was made. There was a room for a couple of the natives to hand paint the rum bottles. There were quite a variety of different fruit flavors of rum. You could either buy the hand painted bottles empty, or purchase them filled with a fruit flavored rum. Because the rum has fruit flavor in it, it is considered a souvenir, not part of how much alcohol you are allowed to bring back into the states. After the rum factory, we went to a real shopping mall. I was mainly interested in the Hard Rock Cafe. Most of the shops there were boutiques, and not stuff you would normally have in the states. Or at least in Milwaukee... The last stop was a shopping center for bartering. Be careful if you aren't comfortable saying no to the vendors. They are extremely pushy. Most of them have the same kind of stuff. We went thru all the stores, and then went back to the store that gave us the best deal on what we wanted. We basically spent most of our free time at the pool and beach. There were only 2 complaints I had. One was that the pool could have been cleaned more often. There were always a lot of leaves and debris in the pool. At least near the swim up bar. The rest of the resort was incredibly clean and absolutely beautiful! The second complaint was the hairdryer in the bathroom. It looks like a mini vacuum cleaner, and gets very hot when you are using it, which makes it hard to hold. I should have brought my own.We saw the nightly entertainment every night. Some of the shows were great, some, not so much, but we met several other couples during our stay, so we'd hang out there drinking and socializing anyway. We did go to the disco a couple of times and the American bar a couple of times, but we didn't stay out late cuz we were so tired from spending the day in the sun... But drinks are all included at both, and there is no cover charge at the disco. If you need to check email, they do charge $5 per half hour to use the internet at the business center. Please keep in mind that it is dial up and not high speed. It was completely annoying.We left after 9 days, but didn't want to.... we would definitely go back!

<Content>Amazing Place  Iberostar Bavaro was so amazing!! My Fiance  I were constantly in awe about what we were getting for our $$. Definitely go in March thru May when it's cheaper. Also make sure to spend the extra $$ to stay at Iberostar Bavaro instead of Punta Cana or Dominica, it's well worth it. The food  restaurants were amazing  we're used to NY quality so we were impressed. The grounds are spotless  filled with peacocks  foliage. The beach was soft white sand with aqua water, great snorkeling right at your feet. The rooms are all suites with their own balcony. Simple but very large and clean. The most impressive part of Bavaro was the service. It actually seemed like everyone there loved their job. We really had an amazing time and had no regrets. Just make sure to stick to your transfer buses  check the actual bus # on the bus. Some of the drivers at the airport try to lie and want to take you for extra $$. We didn't drink the water and came away with no stomach problems. We can't wait to return and possibly try other Iberostars as well!

<Content>Wonderful wedding week! My husband and I were married on the beach at the Iberostar Bavaro the week of May 12th. We brought sixteen guests with us for the week. We had guests of all ages. Half friends half family and everyone had a great time. The weather was great all week (except one day that it rained). The nights are very sticky!Check-in: Arrived at 12:30 and most were checked in. We did request a few changes (just to have some of the wedding party closer to beach front with us) and the requests were met. They watch the luggage while you have a drink at the lobby bar, have lunch or make dinner reservations.Rooms: Bungalows were great. Very clean but the air conditioning wasn't up to the humidity. If you tip the maids a dollar or two they keep your mini fridge stocked well.Pool: Little chilly and some debris around the pool bar. Plenty of sun and palapas if you like the shade. Lots of chairs to lay on. Same with the beach.Pool Bar: Great location! Right next to the lunch buffet!Nightly Entertainment: Mostly really good shows. They encourage participation and dance with the audience. Also there is a casino right next door 5 minute walk or you could take a fun ride on a golf cart. Just ask.Employees: Hands down the best! Out of all the resorts I have been to the employees are the best. Everytime we walked through the lobby, went to eat, have a drink they remembered us by name and made us feel special.Wedding: Now to my favorite part of the trip. It was beautiful! We really didn't know all that much of what goes on till we got there but anytime we wanted to know something or to change something it was done! They go over everything with you to your specifics and make it so beautiful. The photography was excellent! Better than I see at home.Recap: All in all we had an amazing wedding with our family and friends. If we went by ourselves I'm not sure it would have been so good with the lack of entertqinment except for the bartenders.

<Content>A wonderful memorable experience. My husband and I just returned from a week-long stay at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana Dominican Republic. We were there from Saturday October 6th through Saturday October 13th. We definitely had a different experience from the last reviewer. We did a lot of research, mostly on tripadvisor.com, prior to this trip and have traveled before to St. Lucia and Playa del Carmen, Mexico so have some experience with all-inclusives. We had a wonderful, memorable time and loved the Iberostar Bavaro.We traveled with Gogo Tours (managed by Prieto Tours once you arrive in the DR) because they were slightly less expensive than Apple. We flew direct from Atlanta with Delta (no meal on this flight so make sure to plan for that because I was hungry!) and navigated our way through the Punta Cana airport to the Prieto Tours check-in desk, onto the shuttle and to the resort with relative ease. You just have to walk like you know what you are doing so you don't get hassled by the luggage guys.The Iberostar Bavaro itself is beautiful. We drove by several other resorts during our stay and thought that the IB was definitely the best-looking. The grounds are beautiful and clean. There is some construction going on but we found it to be minimal and not intrusive. All of the staff are very friendly and helpful and never expected a tip but we gave ones at times because we appreciated the service and knew that the people are living on much less than we are. We loved our room, it was clean and neatly furnished. The bed was a little hard and the pillows a little flat. My husband enjoyed being able to keep up with ESPN and watch a couple movies on the English speaking tv stations. We were always comfortable. We did leave tips for the housekeepers a couples days when we needed more drinks in the fridge but it didn't seem to matter because they seemed to restock it anyways.The beach is amazing, gorgeous and we spent lots of time relaxing under a palapa and swimming in the crystal waters. We were worried about rain but had sunny weather every day while we were there. It rained a couple days but only for a part of the day and we always found something else to do. We preferred to sit in the palapas down near the beach bar where there is less activity and easy access to delicious tropical drinks.We absolutely loved the food. We thought the buffet was very satisfying and diverse and delicious. There was always fresh fruit which we loved and local selections. We usually went to eat around 630pm or 7pm for dinner. We usually sat in the same section at the buffet restaurant so our server got to know us and our preferences so we tipped him the day we left in appreciation but again it was not expected. We ate out at the Gourmet/French, Mediterranean, and Cajun restaurants. The Gourmet was divine - you have to go there. And the Mediterranean and Cajun were good too. We always had good service and enjoyed the food.We thought the shows were hilarious. The Star Friends are crazy and love making all the tourists do funny, inane things. We loved the music and the skits. Two nights we were there they had dancers and singers come in for more serious performances, we enjoyed the Latin One which featured dances and songs from Latin countries. The bar is right by the show area so you can sit there if you prefer. We took two excursions. Each tour company seems to call their excursion different things. We went on the Carribean Festival which is a cruise down the coast where you stop at a reef to go snorkeling and then go to a closed in area to snorkel with nurse sharks and rays. The boat was fun, music, drinks and performers. They made us dance which my husband hated but it was tolerable. We really enjoyed the snorkeling on the reef, lots to see. There were not many nurse sharks or rays in the closed in area so it was not too impressive plus we felt bad for them being trapped in the area. The other excursion we took was the Jeep Safari - we were going to do the Bavaro Runners where you ride with a group in a truck but no one else signed up for it. I was not too excited about this trip because you drive your own standard jeep in a group with others and have to navigate the DR roads and I was terrified but my husband drove and we had quite the adventure. It is pretty crazy driving in the DR because there don't seem to be many rules of the road that are followed but we were safe and had fun. They drove us through a sugar cane plantation (be prepared to get splashed with mud), up into the mountains, through the countryside, to a school, to an overlook, to a local house, to a ranch where we had lunch which was good and you could go horsebacking riding (we didn't but we don't like horses so we relaxed on hammocks), and then to one of the more virgin beaches farther north of Punta Cana in Uvero Alto. It was a long day and hot because no a/c in the cars but overall it was fun and exciting and we got to see a lot of the country we were visiting. There are some tourist trap aspects of the trip, they usher you quickly through a tobacco museum and then into the gift shop where the staff seem to stalk you. They ask you to buy lollipops for the children and people were throwing them out the windows of the jeeps which just seems way too dangerous. And then at the family home they sell goods that are made in the DR. You just have to be willing to say no, thank you if you don't want anything.Throughout the trip you do have to keep in mind that you are in a third world country where most people are very poor and that this whole area of the DR was developed for tourism and that this is these people's livelihood. There are children begging for money and the people on the tours that we took do want to be tipped but we did not ever feel like we had to tip, we just chose to. We definitely most enjoyed the resort and the beach and relaxing which is what we came to do. The excursions were an adventure and we loved seeing and exploring the country. So overall it was a trip to remember and the memories are fond ones so we give the experience 5 stars and a thumbs up.

<Content>It was all right This is a very honest review. My husband, my 18 year old and myself traveled there from Oct 7-oct 14, first time in Dom Rep with GoGo Vacations. the weather is great, people are nice and friendly but everywhere yu go you gotta tip. I really dont understand how people can give a 5 for this resort. Yes, it is beautiful, the grounds are nice and clean, the people are friendly, BUT it is not a 5 star resort. maximum I would give this resort is 3.5 stars- no more. First of all the rooms are plain ugly and smell bad, there's is an ugly comforter on the bed which feels like it is made out of wood, there are no ocean front or oceanview rooms, all i saw was an ugly construction and a green smelly garden next to my balcony, no jacuzzi tab in the bath and no jacuzzi in the pool area either, only in the spa on the Dominicana side, their shampoo gave me an irritable itching and the soap does not smell good and dried my skin, but that aside I took everything with me. As soon as we arrived I ordedred room service, which I thought was convinient, but it tasted like crap and you really dont have a lot to choose from - the same menu every day, no breakfast menu and no beverages. Ok so we went to the buffet, again another dissapontment, it was almost 7:30 pm but it seemed that they already finished restocking the buffet because it looked empty, only one choice of fish, chicken and meat, really nothing to choose from, I only had some desert and fruit and pretty much went to bed hungry. the buffet wa sthe same every day, not much changed and not many selections, the breakfast buffet was really good, but lunch and dinner really bad! We tried the steak house and Middeteraneo, I liked the steak house etter, at Mediteraneo service sucked, was very slow and it didnt taste that good. My toddler reall didnt have much chouce to eat and lost weight during the vacation, One More Thing- their cribs that they provide are not safe! I didnt use it even once, he slept with us all 7 nights, the crib is very shaky- did not seem safe to me at all. The pool is nice and the beach is of course beautiful. the nightly shows are boring, only liked the Friday and Saturday show. I really hope you would consider my review before making your decison, it is 100% honest, I have been to Mexico and Jamaica before and this vacation was the worst vacation so far, if you are traveling as a couple go to Secrets Excellence, as a family with kids, I would suggest Palladium Resorts in Riviera Maya. If you still decide to go, good luck, I hope you wont be dissapointed.

<Content>The Perfect Honeymoon My new husband and I went to Iberostar Bavaro for our honeymoon and it was absolutley perfect!! This was his first time traveling out of the country. Despite his initial nerves, the beauty and serenity of this hotel quickly calmed his nerves. I had visited Punta Cana two years prior to this trip and was slightly dissappointed with the trip. For this trip, I did my research and found Iberostar Bavaro to be the best bang for the buck. The ride to the hotel from the airport was smooth. Check in was great and we were able to get a room with a beautiful view of the pool. The room was pretty much sound proof; noise from the pool was not an issue. Every day our maid left hibiscus flowers in our room. Our room was always made up by the time we were back from our excersions. The food was wonderful. It was not as bland as other buffet style all inclusions. There was always something to eat, even if the themed night was not food you typically ate. The main buffet was always a good choice. We ate at the steak house, Cajun restaraunt, and the Gormet restaraunt. No complaints. The pool lunch buffet was delicious as well.I highly recomment the excersion to Saona Island and the Safari Tour over any other. We also went on the personal speed boat/snorkeling tour which was a blast. The catamaran ride back from Saona Island was wonderful and we even saw flying fish. The beach that they take you to for the Safari Tour is breathtaking. This is their off season. The whole area is extremely busy from December through March. We loved going during the off season. There weren't to many people, we never had to fight for a beach chair, pool side chair, or dinner table, and we were able to make a few friends whie having our own personal time around the resort. I highly HIGHLY recommend Iberostar Bavaro to anyone and everyone. We will definately be back.

<Content>Fantastic Honeymoon We stayed at this resort on our honeymoon for 2 weeks starting 17th Sept 07. All I have to say is only the most spoilt would complain about this resort! It was fantastic, lovely people, great food and amazing grounds. Everyone works round the clock and it shows, the entertainment staff dont stop all day and we found the staff in general cant do enough for you. Dont hesitate if you are thinking of going there you wont be dissapointed.

<Content>Best option for Dom Rep. Just back from Iberostar Bavaro 9-22 thru 9-29. We have been there several times and will go back again. In fact ran into a german couple who had been to Dom Rep 7 times , different resorts each time and the Ib Bav was the best. The people, resort, beach and dining options are tops for an all-inclusive. Make sure you try the Paella made during lunch at the pool side grill. They grill something and make Sangria at the poolside grill during lunch. If they are not grilling at the Bavaro that day walk down to the IB Dom poolside grill during lunch and they will have something going on. The buffet typically has a theme each night. The Dominican night they grill carrib lobster and you can eat as much as you like! The sit down restaurants are great but the gourmet is tops. Yes like everyone says try the lobster salad.The only concern is they are building a new Iberostar Resort next door and the construction noise is aggravating. I will wait until the new resort is completed before returning.The water activities are Ok but the Parasailing is way to short for the money, $85 US for a 8 minute ride...not long enough. All of the Iberostar resorts are nice. The Bavaro takes it to a little higher level and its worth the slightly higher price.

<Content>The Iberostar Bavaro was paradise! My husband and I just returned Oct 1st from our stay at the Iberostar Bavaro Suites in Punta Cana. We had previously stayed at Iberostar Paraiso in the Mayan Riviera so we knew what to expect from this resort. Even so, it exceeded our expectations, this resort was incredibly beautiful. The grounds, the rooms and the restaurants are spotless, they clean continuously.Upon arriving, the staff was extremely curteous and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed during our stay. the language barrier was not a problem as most employees spoke some, if not very good english.They are in the process of renovating the rooms. All in all, the rooms weren't bad but starting to show some signs of wear and tear. The bed, slightly saggy and the three flat pillows were our biggest complaint. Also, there are no clocks in the rooms so you may want to pack a travel alarm clock. It's easy to sleep in as the curtains are dark and the rooms were quite sound proof. It was very quiet and peaceful.The food was better than we expected after what I have read in reviews. Not what we're used to in the States, the cuts of meat were not up to our standards, a lot tougher. The chicken was usually good. Try the Japanese restaurant, it was the best in our opinion. The buffet at the pool was good and they keep it going from 10-12, breakfast and 12-6 with lunch. There is always something to eat no matter your taste.The beach was even more gorgeous than the pictures can begin to show. Always plenty of chairs and palapas. The pool was smaller than what we're used to, but with a beach that beautiful, who wants to sit at the pool?! The Star Friends tend to be a little annoying. They are constantly walking up and down the beach trying to get you to participate in activities, even if you are napping. The pool area is really loud during the afternoon, with Star Friends on microphones, etc.We found the tiki bar on the beach to be more relaxing and Julio, the bartender, is wonderful. The Rock Star Cafe was ok. My husband liked it because it is one of the few places with a/c and sports on tv. There are American tv stations like CNN, ABC NY, some ESPN for which my husband was greatful! The nightly shows were a little cheesey but fun. We always enjoyed the band afterward, they had some very talented performers who sang in both Spanish and English. If you are considering staying at the Iberostar Dominicana or the Iberostar Punta Cana because it is a little cheaper, don't. It is well worth the extra $ to stay at the Bavaro instead. The rooms are nicer, one of their pools is closed for renovation, chairs and facilities are not as nice as it seems much older. You still have privelages to all of their restaurants, bars, etc.All in all it was a wonderful vacation. We highly recommend this resort and are looking forward to staying there again in the future.

<Content>Highly Recommend Iberostar Bavaro I came to Iberostar with a group of 6. The vacation went by really quickly and EVERYONE had a great time. The staff at the hotel were so friendly and helpful. There was something to do for all of us. We went to the spa, played golf, archery, darts, kayak(free) just to name a few activities. The food was pretty good and their were some vegatarian options, although I do wish they had more available. They are very generous with the alcohol and always keep the wine glass full at dinner. A couple of tips: make friends with the conciege next to the front desk and bring lots of dollar bills.

<Content>Awesome Vacation at the Bavaro! Myself and 6 of my friends just returned from staying 8 days at the Iberostar. This place is awesome and the staff are so nice and accommodating. We made friends with Wilson, Spaghetti, Coco and Manual of the Star Friends staff. They were fabulous and great entertainers. The food was very good and the rooms are so big and roomy. The shows were both theatrical and hilarious and they take great pride in making your stay enjoyable. If you participate in any of the activities and win, you are presented with a certificate, t-shirt and hat on stage before the show starts. Four of us got to go upstage and participate in the ceremony. The beach and pool are great too. We are already planning to go back next year and will be bringing a few more friends after hearing how much fun we had and want to join in. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone. I could not tell of anyone not having a pleasurable vacation while we were there. We met a lot of vacationers from the states who were having just as much fun as we were.Iberostar Bavrao and the Star Friends staff are the best!

<Content>Perfect My wife, 8 year old son and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro for three weeks between the 13th August and 3rd September 2007.Last year we stayed at the Iberostar Costa Dorado and thought it would be hard to beat 鈥?but we all felt that the Bavaro had the edge.So what is so special? The beach, staff, grounds, food, cocktails, reception, maid service 鈥?everything really, with no complaints I can think of at all.I think what made it better is that it is a little more compact than the Costa Dorado 鈥?within 20 metres of our room (ocean view) we had the beach, the pool and lunchtime buffet/bar/barbeque area. We felt comfortable letting our son wonder between the 3 areas at will.In addition the rooms (junior suits) are better and are in smaller 8 units blocks scattered around the beautiful grounds.Some have complained about the noise of the peacocks 鈥?heard them once or twice during our stay, musty rooms 鈥?not ours, food 鈥?good variety  excellent specialty restaurants  reception desk 鈥?again fine.The only area we could think of to improve is that there is a limited number of hot vegetarian options in all the restaurants 鈥?which was a little difficult for my wife.One thing 鈥?if you intend to take out the Hobby Cats 鈥?please take the lesson if you do not know how to sail. On more than one occasion the Hobby Cats were taken out of control into the swimming areas by people who did not know what they are doing. This is dangerous and could lead to a serious accident.So to sum it all up 鈥?perfect 鈥?we will be returning for 3 weeks in 2009 !!Finally - we would just like to say Hi to Drew, Nancy  Lou - it was great to meet you - we will be in touch soon.

<Content>Fantastic vacation My family of four (2 adults, 2 teens) stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 8/21 to 8/28/07. The hotel is immaculate, always people cleaning, sweeping etc. Staff is very friendly. 1) food - there is so much food you could eat all day long if you wanted to. The breakfast buffet has pancakes, waffles, french toast. bacon, potatoes cereals, fresh fruit (the mango is delicious), muffins and danish, etc etc. We always had lunch at the buffet by the pool. Also plentiful - fish, burgers/hotdogs, salads, pasta, and a variety of other things, too many to mention. Plus great desserts and an ice cream bar.Dinner - buffet was good, got alittle monotonous after a few nites.We ate at La Dorada (seafood) and the Gourmet restaurants.They were both very good.2) Beach/Pool - very clean. Beautiful beach, silky sand, lots of palapas for shade at the pool and at the beach. Beach vendors a short walk from the hotel. Lots of fun, be sure to negociate your price. You can do well, but do not pay the asking price, they will bargain with you. Lots of activities at the pool / beach if you want to partake - beach volleyball, water aerobics, water polo, dance lessons, bingo etc. There was a live band also a few times during the day.3) rooms - very nice, comfortable. Bed alittle hard but not too bad.4) night life - it is what you make it - there are shows at night if you want to do that - or you can walk over to the Dominicana where there is a small casino. There are also lobby bars. Not too much night life, but we were so tired from being in the sun all day that it didn't matter much to us.5) Overall - one of the most beautiful places to visit. Hotel is landscaped beautifully, lush and tropical. Staff is friendly, service was always good. We were extremely happy with our vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro.

<Content>Perfect vacation - fun and relaxing! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. We were looking for somewhere we could relax without having to think too much about what to do, where to eat, etc. We were celebrating our anniversary and taking a much-needed break.We scoured TONS of websites looking for something nice, not too busy or tacky, relaxing, and preferably all-inclusive. Once we found the Iberostar Bavaro and read the reviews it was a clear winner. And we were not disappointed.The grounds were absolutely spotless. I saw staff dusting the rather intricate railings on the boardwalks. They were constantly mopping the floors. The bathrooms on the beach were some of the nicest bathrooms I've been in, and were also spotlessly clean.Our room was beautiful, modern, and comfortable. We did have a rainy day, and the room was so nice and spacious we didn't mind spending a good portion of the day inside. We had a problem with our drain in our shower the first day and they were there in minutes and had it fixed within the hour.The food was also good. Very Spanish/European. We had low expectations being an all-inclusive, but we were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed every meal.Most impressive, however, was the staff. The entertainment team was enthusiastic, fun, and managed a wonderful balance of getting people involved in activities without pestering. We often just watched them interacting with other guests and enjoyed their antics. The servers and waiters were friendly, professional and seemed to really enjoy their jobs, as did everyone else we encountered. If it was raining, a covered golf cart would bring you to dinner (or wherever else you wanted to go).We would highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro. We now live in the UK and are excited to plan a visit to an Iberostar resort in Spain. Side note: We arranged our travel plans with [--] and they were great. We got a great price and they even arranged for a very professional bus service from the airport.

<Content>Loved the resort, although construction and"star friends" more than overwhelming Just returned from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro. There were eight of us altogether and we had a good time. The rooms are nice but are showing signs of age. They really could use some renovating. If you book a room, make sure you request rooms which are closer to the Dominica side of the resort. There is construction going on next door to the hotel on the right side and the noise is overwhelming. Don't plan on sleeping in. The banging starts at 9:00am and goes on all day until 5:00pm. The beaches are just breathtaking and the pools were awesome. Food was great! Highly recommend the Japanese restaurant. Buffets had so much food, it was difficult to decide what to eat! The staff was very nice, but look out for the star friends who provide the daily entertainment. They don't know how to take no for an answer. Beware if you go to the lounge early before the evening show. I'm sure they are told to try and get the guests to dance with them, which is ok but if you tell them no, they will harass you all night. You have to get rude for them to leave you alone. They also did this during the day with the few outside activities they had during the day. Overall, we all enjoyed ourselves and had a great time. I would recommend this hotel but look out for the few negatives.

<Content>Perfect holiday vacation We stayed here over Thanksgiving holiday in 2006. We had an excellent time. The food was superior, resort employees were kind and courteous. The resort was extremely clean and we enjoyed being catered to on a 24 hour basis! You won't be disappointed staying here.

<Content>IB lived up to its Tripadvisor ranking I find a lot of value in the more detailed reviews, but if you wish to bypass the rather long description of our experience at the Iberostar Bavaro below, here is the gist: we were 2 families; adults in their early forties, with 3 boys (13, 13, and 18) and one girl (16). We all had a blast, and are looking forward to our next visit. It was ideal for the teens in our group. This resort lived up to its tripadvisor ranking, and I strongly believe that any negative experiences detailed on this website are the exception, and not the rule. Now for the wordy version鈥? We booked our 10 day vacation through Liberty Travel (much more prevalent in Northern NJ than Apple Vacations). We got 3 rooms, and after reading several reviews we made sure that our agent had in writing that we wanted renovated rooms, with either pool or ocean view, and 2 rooms connecting. We also followed up with an email to a contact at the resort. Though we were only granted one of our requests (renovated rooms), Betty (at check in, who was very nice and helpful) assured us that these were very good rooms. And sure enough, they were in a great location. After walking around the entire complex we realized how lucky we were with our location.  The rooms themselves were very nice. Each had a living area with a small sectional. The beds were rather small for full size. The bathroom was quite nice. Each room has a mini-fridge, stocked with bottled water, beer, and soda. Although the policy states that the fridge is restocked every other day, if you tip the maid, she will replenish every day, and leave you extra of whatever you are consuming (in our case, we always got extra bottled water). There is also a safe in each room (no charge, but you have to ask for a key to be able to use it).  The grounds are immaculate. You have peacocks, and flamingos roaming the grounds. And not one day passed where I did not notice someone tending to the landscaping. My wife appreciated that the public bathrooms by the beach and pool areas were constantly being tended to. The main lobby is quite impressive, and most of the nocturnal activity revolves around the main lobby (the restaurants, the main buffet, and the nightly entertainment). We felt comfortable enough to let our 13 year olds do their own thing (and they did). Although the 3 resort complex can initially be intimidating, after a day or 2, you get your bearings, and getting around is not an issue.  Food seems to be the area that runs the gamut from very bad to very good reviews. At IB there are 2 main buffets: Los Haitices (breakfast 7-10, lunch 1-3, dinner 6-10) and Los Bohios (breakfast 10-12, lunch 12-4, and it turns into the steakhouse restaurant in the evening). There is such a variety at both (though Haitices has more of a selection) that you should find something to your liking. At times I came across some very salty fish, or some tough steak, but I always found something that was appetizing. Be sure to take advantage of the guy at the fruit carving station, he鈥檒l make you a nice plate of sliced mango and pineapple. The a la carte restaurants are the preferred route, and if you are flexible enough (ie., making same day reservations for 9pm dinner), you can probably have dinner every night at the restaurants (there is a limit of guaranteed reservations depending on the length of your stay). We ate at the Japanese spot (twice), the Cajun spot (twice) and the steakhouse (once). The steakhouse was no Morton鈥檚, but it was OK (I don鈥檛 think DR is beef country). The service at Jambalayas was great, as was the food. And the sushi at Hoshiros was very fresh. Wendy from Guest Services was very accommodating in getting us same day reservations. I had also read some negative comments about the entertainment. I just don鈥檛 understand the mindset of the people making those remarks. What are they expecting? Rogers and Hammerstein? You are in the Dominican Republic. The same people working the shows (Star Friends) are the same locals who run the activities during the day. They do a fantastic job of getting to know everyone, and getting everyone involved. The audience participation shows are the most entertaining, so sit back, have a Coco Loco, and enjoy the festivities. The only critique I am compelled to make is the whole language thing. Everything is repeated in Spanish, English, German and French. And that can make the shows drag a bit.  Speaking of the Star Friends鈥hese folks really try to make a difference. Juan (Mr. Sexy), Henry (King Kong), Espagetti, Oscar, Patricia, et al鈥hey all in some form contributed to our very positive experience. They really connect with the kids/teens and adults alike. I noticed guests greeting them like they were life long friends. From running beach volleyball, to getting my conservative wife to pop balloons on my lap on stage, enough cannot be said about the job they do. The service was what impressed us the most. With one exception (the omelette guy at Bohios), we found everyone to be very friendly. Here鈥檚 a tip: a little courtesy and respect will go a long way. Make an attempt to speak their language. Though most speak English (and some German and French), don鈥檛 act like they should speak English. We also brought about $200 in 鈥渢ip money鈥?(100 singles and 20, 5 dollar bills). And we tipped the individuals that went above and beyond (and that made them even more attentive). Room service was included in the 鈥渁ll inclusive鈥?(and the kids took advantage of it, with no complaints). We also had 2 instances where we needed a maintenance person, and in both cases the guy showed up within 10 minutes.  Some highlights from our trip: the guys working the beach Bar Siboney (Leonardo Mota, Jose Nunez and Nilson) were great. We tipped them a couple of bucks each, and they made sure we had refills (whether we needed them or not) when they closed the bar at 6pm. Jose also fried our hotdogs (it鈥檚 a Jersey thing), and had a 鈥渟ack鈥?of fries and fried hotdog chunks prepared for us every afternoon. Be sure to visit Nelson 鈥淭obacco鈥? He hand rolls cigars in the atrium where the Disco is (at the Iberostar Dominicana/Punta Cana). Tip him a few dollars, bring him a drink, and he鈥檒l roll you a nice stogie every time you see him.  One last tip: bring Pepto. We brought a veritable drugstore with us (just in case) and found that taking pepto as a precaution (before you have an issue) was the best thing. As soon as anyone noticed some 鈥渟oftness鈥? 2 pepto tablets did the trick and no one had any stomach issues throughout the 10 day stay (you can鈥檛 help but drink tap water鈥here do you think their ice comes from?).

<Content>Fantastic all-inclusive! We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro June 30-July 7th and had a wonderful time. Everthing from the room to the food was wonderful. The thing that stands out most was the great attitude of every employee we encountered during our stay: They were happy, helpful and glad you were there. The rooms were very nice, spacious and newly remodled. I was amazed at the food choices they were wonderful for an all-inclusive. The buffet had many options even whole grain choices in the a.m., Friday night was lobster night. There were also speciality resturants that you could eat at in the evenings. The food and expierience were wonderful in these, but we feel that they should re- think the arduous reservation systrem for this. The beach was beautiful and had plenty of palapas and even a beach bar. This was our first time at an Iberostar resort and it was exceptional expierence.

<Content>Would Definitely Visit Again Fabulous vacation had by our entire family we would definitley vvacation here again!!! We traveled with our three children and no complaints about the resort other than we could have stayed another couple of days. Nicely renovated rooms, clean facility, good food. There is definitely something for everyone to eat, they even have SOY Milk at breakfast. Flight out of Newark was only 3.15 minutes, a/c buses to transport you to the resort. have your $10 pp ready for the DR entry fee as soon as you hop off the plane and take a picture with some cute young ladies dressed in festive clothing. The baggage handlers are a bit persistent but with a firm no they go away.Ride to resort is only 25 minutes.Japanese restaurant was surprisingly good.the nightly entertainment was a bit lame, humorous at times. Nice bar drinks Iberostar, Capirenha,Impeccable beach, easy to get chairs under the umbrellas. Pool was also quite nice, easy to get chairs as well.surface around the pool is quite slippery so flip flops are a MUST!Although you are not required to tip, the wait staff and maids work their tushes off so we gave them a very nice tip ant the end of our stay.Spanish is the language spoken, english is the minority, so at least try and everyone appreciates the effort.

<Content>Great Beach, beautiful grounds, ok food Just got back this week from a 10 day stay at the Iberostar. We are beach people and found that this was one of the better that we've been to. Plenty of room to play and not a problem getting a palapa. The staff was friendly, especially if they found you giving them a little tip. The food was ok at best. We ate at the Japanese and the Steakhouse and found that both were not what we would consider gourmet. We all got a little stomach thing at one time or another during our stay. I suppose it was just that everything was just a bit different. Breakfast was the best meal that we had. It took a couple of days to get the food schedule down. I thought that they might be more accomodating considering that people are coming from alot of different time zones. The entertainment was very cheesy but made us laugh a little. I wouldn't suggest seeing every show. Vey redundent. The rooms were adaquate. We had a family of four with a king bed and 2 couches that doubled as beds for the kids. My 12 year old son got the short bed, similar to a loveseat. Not sure how you justify putting a family of 4 in a room like that but we liked our location, close to the pool so we sucked it up. Iberostar advertises as a 5 star NOT. Took 2 excursions, the Jungle Tour and Marinarium. I would say the Jungle tour was the better of the two. All in all it was a great vacation. Excellent beach, beautiful surroundings well kept, nice staff. A bit of spanish goes a long way!

<Content>Well kept resort, mediocre food, beautiful but busy beach To give an idea of our point of reference, my husband and I have visited St. Lucia, Negril  Playacar in the past few years, staying at all-inclusives each time (Riu  Sandals).Grounds- The grounds of this hotel were beautiful and well kept. The wildlife (flamingos and peacocks) was a great touch that we had only seen once before in Mexico with monkeys. I will say that the peacocks are very loud in the morning; you may want to bring earplugs in case your room is near their favorite areas. The resort is very spread out because they are all 4 unit, 2 floor buildings, so if you don鈥檛 want to do much walking I recommend staying next door at the other Iberostars. Those are more typical style hotel buildings. We loved the building style, but we did get a workout. The landscaping was very lush with tons of palm trees. Room- We requested a 2nd floor renovated room. No big complaints, the room was clean  spacious. Nicer than all previous rooms we had stayed at because of the size, but wish there were more options with an ocean view. Bed and pillows were fairly soft and comfortable, but after staying at the RIU in Mexico, I have a new definition for hard mattresses and pillows. They aren't pillowtopn or down at this hotel, but they are not concrete either. Air conditioning was as powerful as you need it to be, we often turned it off because we would get so cold. We tried tipping extra with a request in Spanish for more water, but didn鈥檛 have any luck. Sometimes there was the typical tropical resort musty room smell, but I brought a plug in air freshener and it seemed to help. The hot water was shut off during the day, which was only a problem when we tried to shower right before we left for our flight home. Beach- The beach is beautiful. The water was clearer and calmer than I expected, with some waves but not too big. The water is not as clear or blue as Negril and the snorkeling off the shore wasn鈥檛 anything worth looking at. This hotel is on the end of the beach, so it is nice to not have another resort next door to the right, but the shops to the right mean that there is a constant stream of people walking the beach to go to them. A little too busy for my taste. The shops were very typical souvineir junk, we were a little disappointed that there wasn't more craftman, handmade stuff because we like to bring back items made in the country we visted. In case you are concerned about bringing kids, while I was there I would estimate at least 20% of women were topless. No big deal for us, but I know some people are not comfortable with it.Food- The food at the buffet was not good and I'm a terrible cook so I'm not picky. The quality was usually okay, but the choices were mediocre at best and we often saw the same thing each night except for the one station that would vary with the theme. I wish they鈥檇 had more local food theme nights; that was the one night we enjoyed. (fajitas made to order) Eating at the buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner got very old and even when we went to the other resorts, we found the same options. We also ate at the steakhouse  the gourmet. The steakhouse was okay, but we are from Chicago and might be a little picky since Chicago is known for it鈥檚 steakhouses. The gourmet was excellent, I did have to send my steak back to be cooked a little longer but it tasted great. It was also nice to have a place where kids were not allowed. The reservation process is annoying though. We prefer Sandals style where there are ala carte restaurants that both require and don鈥檛 require reservations. It makes the trip seem a little more spontaneous than if you know you always have to eat at the buffet unless you are allowed a reservation. Also, the number of reservations you are allowed depends on the length of your stay. 5 nights = 2 reservations.Staff- The staff was friendly and the waitstaff was very attentive. The service was the best we鈥檝e seen, but tipping is allowed here and that probably has a lot to do with it. The one thing I was surprised by was the language barrier with the staff. Many could only speak Spanish and understood very little English. It was really only an issue when trying to find out what was in the food at the buffet (I鈥檓 allergic to shrimp). I made sure I understood how to say 鈥渁llergic to shrimp鈥?in Spanish before we left just in case and it came in handy. Oh, and I think the lobster buffet everyone raves about was during the day at the pool area and was a seafood paella that included king prawns. Unless maybe we missed it the other one. Also, they are not lobsters they are king prawns. A prawn is actually closer to the shrimp family and is not the same as a lobster. (important difference for someone allergic to shrimp and not lobster)Pool: The pool was nicer than any we鈥檝e seen. The palm tree islands really added a lot of atmosphere. Seemed to always be plenty of chairs. But, there were only 4 hot tubs fenced in an area near the spa and you had to make reservations for them. I really didn鈥檛 care for this set up at all, you couldn鈥檛 see the ocean and couldn鈥檛 decide to leisurely soak in the hot tub without walking all the way over there and making a reservation. Spa: We typically don鈥檛 get a lot of spa services regularly at home, mainly just for special occasions. We have used the spa at Sandals before and always been very happy. We were not happy here at all. On our first day we scheduled pedicures and it was by far the most ridiculous pedicure I鈥檝e ever had. When scheduling it I asked if they could do two pedicures at the same time and they said yes. When we got there we told to sit in regular metal banquet room type chairs. We watched while one person received their pedicure and vice versa, definitely not simultaneous as I had requested. The foot soaking bath used ice cold water (hot water is shut off during the day) and was an old, nasty Dr. Scholls vibrating soaker that they carried over to us. The tech worked on my foot while holding it over a towel in her lap. There was a sanitizing machine for the tools, but it didn鈥檛 have a bulb so I made sure she didn鈥檛 use any cutting tools on me. I felt bad for the technician because she very clearly received little to no training on pedicures and had no idea what she was doing. I would actually have to remind her to do forgotten steps. From beginning to end the pedicure was a horrible experience, so we cancelled the massages we had planned. I would not have walked back into that spa for another service if it was free. We actually soaked our feet in the pool afterward to make sure we disinfected them in the chlorine. I would have complained, but I knew it would be a challenge with the language barrier and didn鈥檛 want to start on vacation on a bad note, so we just laughed it off as an experience. I鈥檝e seen good reviews for other parts of the spa, so maybe just the pedicures are bad. I wasn鈥檛 going to risk it.Entertainment: Typical all inclusive, although a little too cheesy show oriented, similar to RIU. Sandals tends to have more bands in the evening after the cheesy shows and we preferred that to things like 鈥淢iss Iberostar.鈥?The star friends were very friendly and not too pushy.Other: I was disappointed that the beach was not more integrated into the resort in the evening. There was absolutely no people on the beach at night, that entire end of the resort seemed to shut down and was eerily quiet once the steakhouse closed. At Sandals Negril and Grande St. Lucian we would often walk or sit on the beach at night with our drinks and listen to the music coming from the entertainment areas. We had the same issue with the RIU Playacar in Mexico.Overall, the Iberostar was nice and well kept. We would not return to this one because of the food options and the overly busy beach, but we didn鈥檛 regret our choice. We would try another Iberostar in another country to see if the food was bad because of the hotel or the country. So far, we still prefer Sandals for the dining quality, flexibility and variety and also for the inclusion of the snorkeling excursions. We definitely missed that. We enjoyed our stay and found this resort to have the typical pros and cons of any resort. We wouldn鈥檛 return, but I can see why some would want to. It all depends on what is important to you.

<Content>this is the star found this lovely place on trip advisor,hate to give another great secret out. this is the one to stay at....great staff,clean, great beaches....suggest eating more salmon/ fish than beef, food at buffets okay, love fajitas night, cajun restaurant best choice for al la carte, great for families/ groups, went with SO and had great time,hard beds,had a great time will return! along the lines of three star quality hotel (rooms) but settings beautiful (like 4.5 star) but experience is 5 star. hated my massage (or rub) save your money for other adventures. Gym is limited but useful for weights (old).DO reserve a special beach chair with towels in the mornings (don't get up early most folks aren't out until 9am). Safari adventure and snorkeling great. do be careful about beach activites not through tour groups (apple,gogo,etc) (no insurance) and bring at least 50 dollars in ones for tips for servers, maids, etc....love it! Shop on carribean (forget beach shops)

<Content>Nice relaxing vacation My Husband and I had not been away on a vaction together in over three yeas and we just wanted to get away to relax and unwind. The resort itself is beautiful. The room was huge and very clean. They stocked the mini bar everyday with sodas beer and bottled water which was really nice.The beach and the pool are both great. My husband got a bad sunburn the first day so I had to keep him in the shade under the little huts on the beach which luckily were pretty easy to get.If you are looking for gourmet food forget about it. The food is edible but definelty not good. I stuck with fruit and salads most of the week but my husband was starving.The drinks and service were good. The staff is very friendly and most speak pretty good English.My only real complaint is the Club/Disco was full of kids and I mean kids ...14 and under. We left the first night we went and didnt go back since we felt like we were at our daughters middle school dance.All in all we had a very nice time but I do not think I would go back to a resort that wasnt all adults unless I was taking my children

<Content>Magnifico! Ole! Ole!! My 13 year old son and I spent a week at this resort, from 6/15-6/22/07, which coincides with my birthday.What an excellent resort - so full of warm, friendly people, beautiful beach and pool and excellently landscaped grounds.Actually ,this was my 2nd visit in 6 months, having been there 12/7-12/14/06 just in time to see the entire place decked out in Christmas finery and lights- even the palm trees had lights, just like in the Corona beer commercial!The suite we stayed in was just enough close to the pool and beach that within a few steps we were there -with a few less steps to the activities center. If I speak highly of this place, it's because it most assuredly deservs it. The Activities gang assured us of practically non-stop things to do, whether in the pool or on the beach - they double at night, singing and dancing their happy heart saway in high energy effort to engage and entertain us. For us guys it truly was a grand stay - my Yankees-loving baseball son was in 7th heaven, for the satellite TV received stations which are out of our northern NJ access(except for a big, fat extra fee. We'd go back in a New York minute!!

<Content>exceeded our expectations We booked our trip thru our travel agent with Apple Vacations andhad no problems what so ever.Flew out of BWI on Apple airline usa3000, took 3 1/2 hours as promised both arriving and departing. Apple reps met us aftergoing thru customs in big air conditioned bus. Roads are a bitbumpy. Very desolate/poor countryside not much to look at,Hotel was gorgeous. My husband has a back problem and theyimmediately said they were moving us from a 2nd floor room to a1st floor. Staff was very accomadating, On 2nd day we asked forand received at no charge a wheel chair for my husband.The rooms were very clean with king size bed and sofa, Mini barwas restocked every 2 days but leave a note with a $1.00 bill andyou could have pretty much anything you wanted, Some of thecleaning staff speak very little english, so a few spanish wordscome in handy.I cannot say enough about the entertainment staff who try veryhard to make sure you have a good time. Try the water aerobics, it is really fun and helpful with all the food and drink you will consume..One of our tour guides told us that some of the staff only make$250.00 a month so a $1.00 tip a day means a lot. We did findthat they work 11 days straight and are off for three. Most liveat the resort and work 3 hour shifts then their off for 2 then work3 more hours. They work 11 hour days. so remember to tipwhen you can.The bartenders will remember what you drink and keep them coming after a day or two. We also tipped them daily.The food at the main buffet was always good and we never\had trouble finding something to eat and my husband is a pickyeater. We also made reservations at the specialty restaurants.Japanese was greatSteak house was also goodMeditteranean was very good but nothing at all to eat butseafood. Try the pickled Octopus pretty tasty,My only complaint was the humidity. I think I'll go back in Februarybut not again in June.All in All it was a wonderful week that we will always rememberthanks to Apple Vacations and Iberorstar Bavaero

<Content>this is the place for a relaxing vacation! My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro for 5 nights to celebrate our anniversary. We were looking for a vacation that did not make us feel like we needed to do any sightseeing. We just wanted to sit at the beach all day and that's exactly what we did! There were tons of palapas and chairs set up but we did get there early every morning to get an area in the first row so we could look out into the ocean instead of through other people's palapas. The staff was extremely friendly and encouraged you to speak Spanish if you could. I was very rusty with it since it had been years ago that I used it but with their help - it started coming back to me. We made sure to tip at every meal (since you don't usually get the same person everyday) and they were definitely appreciative of it. Just a few dollars here and there for good service also gets you an even more attentive waiter/waitress. The rooms definitely had a musty smell (from the air conditioners I think) but the humidity is so high there that I think that it's inevitable....We always had plenty of water in the fridge and the ceiling fan was in constant use. The bathroom was pretty roomy and everything was clean. The only part of our IB vacation that was not as great as everything else was the food. We have pretty high standards but did not have high expectations after reading some of the reviews. The buffet was good for breakfast - always lots of fresh fruit and juice and FANTASTIC coffee! We had lunch often at the poolside area - which had a pretty good variety. We ate at the buffet once for dinner and did not find much that we liked. Also - since it's open air dining there - we were just trying to not sweat to death while eating dinner! We ended up going to the Japanese, Mediterranean, Steak and Gourmet restaurants (which are all air conditioned) for the following nights. (As other people have mentioned - they are not strict about going to the ala carte restaurants more than your guaranteed allotment.) The Gourmet was the best one by far. Also - getting any wine other than their house wine was definitely a struggle. Although we normally drink wine, we stuck to cocktails. Overall - we were very happy with our vacation and returned home very tanned and very relaxed!

<Content>lovely hotel disappointing food Having stayed at the Iberostar Dominican 3 years ago we decided to treat ourselves to the upgrade of the Bavaro, I was really pleased with the suite allocated, but with the site being so large I could have been over near the entertainment building and miles from anywhere else. As it was we were near the beach so had a good walk at night to get to the restaurants, but we were close to the beach and pool bar. Also close to the Domincana hotel . The pool and beach are superb with more than enough sun beds and umbrellas. My main complaint about this hotel is the food. I found the main Bavaro buffett quite poor, even being unable to eat the meat one evening. I am only glad we had the chance to use the other hotels, so please don't be put off by this, use the Dominican  Punta Cana buffetts you will be pleasantly surprised. I also found it hard to get any service in the speciality restaurents, actually waiting 20mins for coffee or another drink in the steak house, needless to say we left without leaving a tip.This is the 4 Iberostar hotel I have stayed in so was quite surprised at the food and poor service in some areas.

<Content>totally awesome June 11 -18 2007 We just returned yesterday from our vacation. Boo - very sad - I want to go back. Our Apple travel agent Jill suggested this spot and it was the most magnificent week. My husband, and 2 boys age 17 and I made the trip. It was a direct flight from Pitts. and since it left early in the a.m. we stayed the night in Pitts to save leaving our house at 3 in the morning. Upon arriving we were greated with spectacular sun and the sounds of the region. Getting through all the paperwork was quite easy and took little time. Check in at the resort was simple and quick. We arrived at 11 A.M. and were told that the room would not be ready until 1P.M. The rooms were not as close to the pool/ocean as I had requested at an earlier date so after speaking to wonderful Rosa ( who had just had her first son while we were there - congratulations Rosa) we were able to get rooms at a better location beginning the following day. That was great we just kept most of our stuff packed and it was an easy move. We had rooms in the 1275 -76 block. While they do not have an ocean/pool view, all we had to do was walk out the door and peak around the corner and right there was the beginning of the beach. So it was awesome. Our rooms were always kept clean and fresh. Our housekeeper, Eufemia was lovely. We did leave a tip $2 on the pillow each day and $2 in the refrig on occasion and requested more water. We also left a tip for the wait staff at the buffets and restaurants. Remember these people work long and hard and for very little pay and a dollar and a smile goes a long long way.The grounds are picture perfect. There are peacocks, ducks, flamingos, birds etc. everywhere. The flowers and trees and all the vegetation is just beautiful. You will feel like you are in a picture book. Of course not enough words could be said about the beautiful beach. The ocean is very calm at this area. There is no need for water shoes since there is not coral to deal with like in Rivieara Maya. But the sand, as silky as it is, gets hot by mid day and you may want your flip flops. We took with us an innertube raft and had alot of fun floating around. They have them there to purchase and the prices are quite fair. We spent ALOT of time snorkeling right there at the resort area. It was beautiful. We took a zip lock bag and put some bread in it and the fishes came from everywhere. Bring lots of sun screen because the sun is strong. One really nice thing about this resort is they have ALOT of polopas (sp?) the palm umbrellas- several of the resorts do not have them and with the sun as strong as it is having a bit of shade was great. I went out early in the morning and put our stuff on a couple chaises and then went for my early morning walk. Only one day did someone bother to move my stuff and I was quite ticked. You can walk for miles. There is plenty of activities to do on the beach like sailing, jet skiis etc. There are some shops quite alot actually at the one end of the resort. They will ask alot for their goods but bartering is expected and it can bring a few good laughs too.  The pool is beautiful and clean. I will say that around the bar area by mid day it gets a little dirty but we just stayed clear of there. There are never ending activities going on anywhere from Bingo to water polo, water volleyball, arm wrestling, dancing, spanish lessons and it goes on and on. The people who coordinate it all are the most energetic, fun, happy people you could ever hope to meet. They speak English, some a little better than others but it is certainly enough for each of us to be understood. They are always up for a good time. Each day has a different theme. Some days there are crazy games on the beach and some days the games are around the pool. You can be as involved as you like or as restful as you like. It is your vacation and you do as you wish.The food was great. Some of it was very different and it was things I had never tasted and that was very cool to try so many different types of food. There was alot of different fish but if you are not a fish eater - no worry- as there is so many other things to enjoy. During the day food is served at several locations and some days have a certain theme. One day this huge skillet of a Cajun dish was prepared by the chef at the grill area and it was spectacular. We had reservations at the Jambalya and the Steak restaurant and they were both excellent. The boys liked the steak place better as for me Jambalya was my favorite. We had booked the Japanese restaurant but could not go as my husband got sick. more on that later. All the people in the restaurants were so kind and nice. We got to know Cecil and he couldn't have been kinder. As for my husband. He had a bit of stomach upset so he chose not to eat or drink one morning. Bad idea. While at the beach in the afternoon he got very ill . Immediately help was called for and with the help of some wonderful gentleman he was carried off the beach and taken to the clinic. Dr. Sharon ? was wonderful. Very professional and VERY concerned. We did go the hospital via ambulance where he was treated for SEVERE dehydration ( his BP was ca put. ). The trip was interesting as the paramedic only spoke a little english and I know 0 spanish. But he was thorough and by trip's end I knew he has 2 lovely children and works 12 hours a day 12 days in a row. These people work hard. The Dr tat the hospital wanted to admit my husband but I was not so keen on that so instead we stayed in emergency room for about 6 hours then came back by way of taxi. I would suggest that everyone purchase the insurance because we are very healthy people and this happened to us so it could happen to anyone . Now it is good to note that Cesar the Apple Rep. at the resort inquired at the hospital twice to see how he was and if I needed him to interpret what was going on but even though the Dr did not speak alot of English we got by and another Dr. came in when we left to make certain we knew what to do. About the Apple Representatives. They were very helpful, informative and very kind. Any time I had a question of how to do something they were there with an answer. As Cesar said, It's not a problem, you are on vacation He is a really nice guy, I hope you get to meet him.We did the 4x4 ATV excursion. We all really enjoyed it. Expect to allow about 4 hours for it because where we went was about a 50 minute trip. Take sun glasses to protect your eyes from all the dust. Our guide was a young fellow, I wish I knew his name. Very nice and very open to questions. I learned alot about their way of life from him. We didn't do any other excursion because quite frankly no one wanted to be away from the resort.Each evening there is entertainment. Now some reviews knock it but remember these are young people doing their very best and no kidding it is fun and good and if you come away with a negative thought well you just aren't a very happy person and maybe you should not have come to this spot. Some nights there are professional entertainers that come. The musicians are wonderful. We could have listed to them forever. Very energetic and you just knew you were in the islands. These people (all of them) work very hard at allowing us to have a great vacation.There is a Disco. The boys went there each night and had a great time being with other people from all around the world. They were offered drinks so if you don't want your teenagers drinking give them a fair warning. We had a wonderful week. If anyone from Iberostar reads this, I tip my hat to ALL of you. You are wonderful people and I am happy to have met you. And for all of you who are thinking about going I say Go for it and have a blast.

<Content>Fun, Fun, Fun!!! My large family (ten adults total) stayed at iberostar bavaro from june 3rd to june 10th. We had a great time and i felt the need to share my experiences with you since i learned so much from the sight. Airport: the airport is a really neat looking hut. check in was fairly smooth. The only downside is the VERY aggressive baggage handlers. They see people coming a grab you luggage! We literally had to pry their hands off so we could carry our own luggage. Transportation: we traveled out of chicago with apple vacations. they provided us with transportation to and from the airport. the bus was big with a/c and a nice ride. The roads seemed nicer than people had previously said. Arrival to hotel: when we arrived our rooms were not quite ready. We didn't mind though. We enjoyed our arrival bahama mamma and looked around the resort. The resort: the resort is beautiful! There are flowers everywhere and they are always cleaning, watering, or painting to keep up the looks. Our room was suffiicient. it was not the hilton by any means, but was nice. it had all the important things: a king sized bed, mini frigde, nice balcony, safe, and more. The pool/ ocean: both are nice but we liked the pool because of its activities, closeness to the food, and of course the nice cool pool bar! The bartenders are so much fun. if you get to know them they will make you anything you want. if you are willng, they will try out new drink ideas on you. my husbands favorite bartender was Sala. he gave him a drink that he called the orgasm! most of us survived on a nice cold beer or miami beaches yumm! the pool is nice and cool and clean in the mornings. as the day goes on it gets a lot warmer and dirtier, especially by the pool bar. food: we ate at all the specialty restaurants. we did this by making our initial allowed three and then checking back each day for cancelllations. there was always something available. the breakfast buffet was good, but we did not like the dinner one. it was very repeatitive and so we went to the a ala cartes instead. our favorite was the gormet. The tenderloin and lobster salad are amazing. the lobster salad is really no salad at all. it is pure lobster with chicken and grilled to perfection. you have also got to try the pineaple mango dessert. yummmm! we also liked the japanese, although not cooked in front of you like the menu says, the flavors are still pretty good. cons: those darn peacocks. although beautiful to look at, they are the roosters of the carribean! we were on the second floor and they woke us up EVERY morning at five am! slippery!!! it is very slippery around the pool and at the pool buffet. since people walk around barefoot from getting out of the pool, the tiles are always wet. i myself fell in the buffet and by the pool ( i'm a bit of a clutz sometimes though :) ) overall, it was great. there were ten of us. aged from 27 to 65. all of us found things to do and had an excellent vacation for a good price.

<Content>Relaxing trip, but be careful what you eat! We stayed here for our honeymoon, and had a great experience. The beaches are beautiful with many hammocks available at all times. We stayed in a junior suite, and it was average. The peacocks are very loud in the morning. I would recommend bringing earplugs if you want to sleep in.Tip: The resort allows 3 restaurant reservations per a 7 night stay. We figured out that if you check daily for any cancellations in reservations, you can get in to most restaurants any night. We ate at a restaurant every night we were there. The restaurants have much better food than the buffets. The Gourmet (La Coupale) was the best!Con: I ate something from the buffet that gave me a bad case of food poisoning. Just be careful when eating meat from the buffets. Make sure to see the chef put a freshly cooked serving of meat out before you take any. I think an old chicken patty was the culprit for me.All in all, a great place to relax, read many books, listen to ocean waves and enjoy your company.

<Content>What am I missing? Well, I'm going to surprise some people who are used to glowing reviews of this place, almost all of them 5.0--that's what led me to book the #2 hotel in Punta Cana. I must tell you first that my kids and I are Club Med junkies, and this was my 4th trip to Punta Cana and my only time outside of the Club Med. The only reason we left the Club Med after 5 nights was that I'd booked my trip last fall using Aadvantage miles for 11 days, then come to find out afterwards that Club Med was closed because an Italian company had rented out the entire place from June 2-7, right during the last half of my trip. So I was forced to find another hotel.After, as usual, a fantastic time at CM, we arrived at the Iberostar only to find out that my travel agent had booked the Iberostar Punta Cana and not the Bavaro as I had requested, based on traveller reviews here. I had read the documents and assumed that it said Iberostar Punta Cana simply because that was the city it was in. Also, I'd made the reservation last Feb. or so and simply didn't remember the names of the other hotels next door when I was sent the travel documents a few weeks before departure. My biggest word of advice is to double check this--an honest mistake made by my travel agent because the names are so innocuous. So, anyway, we arrive only to find out that we are in the other hotel, and by the faces of the front desk clerks, which is considered low rent. I ask what the difference in cost is between the two and am told $480 for our 5 night stay based on myself, my 18 yr. old son, and my 14 yr. old son. We ask to see a room, it looks fine, and we're told that the other hotels have MUCH WORSE rooms and that you can't use the dining facilities at the Bavaro if you are staying in the Punta Cana or Dominicana. So I got out my Visa card. Well, we're taken to the other side of the property from where they'd shown us the sample room. Just as close to the beach, and I don't really pay attention to the hammering going on in the group of villas nearby. Mistake. Every single morning, beginning at 8:30 am and lasting till at least 7:30 pm, there is construction, drilling, hammering so loud you want to scream. It woke us up every morning, even on Sunday. The room next to us and below us were also under construction so they started pounding at 10 am there, but only on the first 2 days. I would've requested a room change except........I was too busy throwing up the 2nd day. Yes, after one meal here (dinner at the buffet), I got horrible food poisoning the following morning, couldn't leave the room all day, and finally called for a golf cart to take me to the doctor in the other hotel at 6 pm. They were very nice, gave me an IV because I was so dehydrated, lots of medicine including some just in case such and such happened, told me not to pay until I came back the next day (although they had told me it would be a $90 consultation fee). I might point out that they also couldn't believe it was really food poisoning, suggesting that it was from traveling, until I pointed out that I'd already been in the DR for 6 days. Never once have I gotten ill at a Club Med. Anyway, so I go back the next morning, feeling much better, to get another IV and to pay the bill. I didn't need the SOS pills, still in their unopened wrapper, for nausea but was unable to give them back as it was against policy from the pharmacy. So....the grand total came to $272 for the hotel giving me food poisoning! Because it couldn't be proved, I had no recourse.Let's see, the pluses: grounds are very beautiful, beach is beautiful, there is always food somewhere, rooms fairly spacious. The bartenders and waiters are SO happy! They are always smliing, singing, and dancing. They are definitely the best part of the place. I didn't want you to think I was totally negative......More minuses, however: I hadn't read that men had to have pants in order to go into the sit-down restaurants. Since my son iis 18, he qualified as a man. Well, it is litterally 90 degrees and 94% humidity at that time of year, so we have never brought pants. This is the same place where people are wearing bikinis without cover-ups at lunch! So here we had 2 qualifying nights for the a la carte restaurants and couldn't use them. Yes, we could've bought him some $70 pants in the boutique, but I was pretty fed up about having spent $752 by my 2nd day there. We were able to go to the steak restaurant (the only one where you don't have to wear pants that has table service) and I could only swallow 2 bites of my rib eye. Shoe leather is more tender. I feared the others would be as bad, so I didn't bother with the pants.The food is very plentiful, well presented, and horrible. Again, I hate to compare it to Club Med, which has fantastic food, but I felt very guilty taking food from the buffet and not being able to eat it. Some things were great, but they were few  far between. Also, they close the beach bar at 6 pm. Why?We couldn't do anything at night because we knew that we would be awakened at 8:30 by the construction and, prior to that, the damn peacocks screeching at 6 am. Not that the shows were so good that we didn't mind leaving after 15 mins. They were pretty bad.Maid service was spotty. I requested another pillow and nothing ever showed up. I asked again the next day and got it. Our 2nd to last day, the maid only gave us 2 bath towels. I called for 2 more, and never got them. Room service is prompt (when I couldn't leave the room, we all had stayed in for dinner, not that I ate), but the menu is very limited and they don't bring drinks.I took one step class with broken down Reebok steps right on the side of the pool. The teacher had some woman (guest) from the U.S. teach it for her, and I don't think she ever taught a class before. Plus, the real teacher didn't know how to work the music, so we stopped after each song. The class lasted 20 mins. because she couldn't figure out the CD player. It was a blessing to end it, however.Last thing: on our day of departure, we were supposed to be in the lobby at 11:35 for our shuttle to the airport. I called for a golf cart to get our luggage that never showed up. Finally, at 11:30, my kids and I ran with the suitcases only to find out that the bus had left without us. After much scrambling (our GoGo Tours rep was, naturally, in the other hotel at this point), they found us another tour company's shuttle who took us to the airport. I saw someone there with an Iberostar bracelet like ours and asked if they had been on the bus. They said yes, but that the bus had left early and they had held it up by getting there at 11:30. Let that be another warning to you! They'll leave you, even if you're early. If anything, I expected a Dominican tour bus to be late, not early. That's fine, I guess, but necessary to know, especially if they just up and leave you.Personally, I hate negative reviews. I like knowing that the place I want to go to is fantastic, but that's what I was led to believe by everyone else. Wrong.

<Content>Beautiful facilities, inconsistent food/service My wife and I stayed at the IB four nights during our friends' wedding weekend. Our visit started great with very prompt shuttle service (through a private tour company) and a warm welcome to the resort by reception staff. We received an informative overview of the resort, a tropical beverage, and were invited to our room (1161) while our bags were handled by the bell staff. The facilities here are beautiful -- peacocks roam the grounds (more on them later), flamingos wade in ponds, the gardens are perfectly maintained, and the rooms are spacious and well-appointed. The fantastic pool is the focal point of the resort, but we spent most of our time on the beautiful beach with powder soft sand and crystal clear waters.Our only issues with the resort stem from our interactions with the staff and the food. First, reservations are required for the specialty restaurants at the resort (reservations are not required for the buffet restaurant). The guest services staff are unfriendly at best. They keep irregular hours and are very unaccommodating to large groups and changes to reservations. When attempting to make a reservation at the French restaurant, the staff person thought I said the Fish restaurant and gave me a reservation at the Mediterranean restaurant by mistake. When I went back to resolve the issue he refused to believe I said French and not Fish and by that time reservations at the French restaurant were not available. Of course, we found out later that the restaurant was in fact half-empty because so many people make reservations and then don't keep them. Thankfully, the Mediterranean restaurant was very good. The Japanese restaurant was not good. The buffet is expansive and caters to several nationalities' tastes, but overall quality was poor.Service at the restaurants was also spotty. Although the resort is all-inclusive, they don't make it easy to get what you want. Ordering anything other than the house wine requires a negotiation and at least a few requests.Other than our restaurant-related issues, most of the staff are energetic and friendly. The guys advertising resort activities on the beach can get a little too persistent and the impromptu performance art (for lack of a better term) are a little odd. For instance, out of no where one day a guy dressed as a peacock comes running down the beach chased by a guy dressed as a chef wielding a knife. The peacock grabbed my wife and hid behind her as the chef approached. Then they ran off to annoy other guests. Speaking of peacocks, they are beautiful and exotic, but they crow like roosters on steroids at daybreak.Bottom line, IB is a beautiful place. I recommend the specialty restaurants over the buffet, but make your reservations early in the day and avoid interactions with the staff for the sake of your blood pressure.

<Content>FABULOUS TIME AT IBERSTAR First of all my trip to the Dominican Republic was fabulous! The Iberostar Bavaro resort was magnificant with its pools including the swim up bar and the beach right there! The rooms were comfortable, nicely furnished, clean, and big enough not to feel crammed in! The all-inclusive was incredible with all the different restaurants ranging from the dress up/reservation to the steak house right near the pool!! The service was great and was incredibly friendly with everyone.. Even though you hear some Spanish throughout the hotel, you could walk up to an employee, ask a question and get an answer in english. There were daily and nightly activities for all people to get involved with.. water polo/scuba diving lessons, snorkeling, banana boating, tango and salsa lessons, sports on the beach (baseball, volleyball, etc.) water aerobics, bingo, etc etc. It was great! I would reccomend this for anybody thinking of traveling to the Dominican Republic!

<Content>Food for Kings and Queens We went for our first time to the Dominican Republic and chose this resort for our stay May 20-27 based on excellent reviews from tripadvisor. My boyfriend was not sure about going to the Carribean for a vacation (he burns easily - we both used lots of sunblock SPF50). But, he said - if the food was good, then he would have a good time. At an all inclusive resort, I thought that was a pretty high demand, but may not be impossible. Note: My only experience prior to this trip was Sol Club Cayo Coco, Cuba, where the pizza tasted like paper and the best food was the fish and fruit. (The shows, beach, and people in Cuba are fantastic). After a week in Iberostar Bavaro, the food was beyond fantastic and we've never felt healthier. We avoided Amercian food because we can have that at home. We didn't heed any warnings about food and ate a little of everything. Everything that we ate at the buffet was good, even the things I didn't think I would enjoy based on individual taste. There was an endless variety and change every day. We ate two main courses and a plate of dessert. There were so many heavenly dishes :) We stuffed ourselves so much at breakfast and dinner, that we had no room for lunch. We went to the a la carte restaurants: Cajun, Pagoda, and Gourmet and ordered something different so we could try more foods. The food was well prepared and presented by the chefs. The service was great and kept our wine glasses full. At the Pagoda (Asian) restaurant, I had the Korean veal and lychee (unbelievably tasty), and we had to compliment the chef on the steak at the Gourmet Couples restaurant. The steak was was better than my boyfriends and I prefer his cooking to eating out at expensive restaurants. We had a plate of fruit with every meal. At breakfast, they had fresh fruit drinks except for our favourites- mango and lychee (only served in fruit form) - but, their banana and milk can now be added to that list. All in all, we are now adjusting to the food back here home in Canada, where we've lived all of our life (33  35 years).We were so excited about being in the Dominican Republic, we just had to take the excursions: Bavaro Runners Outback Safari, Hotel Beds Dunes Buggies and Horseback Riding, and Bavaro Splash. I enjoyed the dune buggies the most. Yes, I'm female. We were a little disappointed that we had to drive in a line and there was so much dirt in the air. They sell bandanas to cover your face for $5. We drove in pairs and I did most of the driving. They took us up a dirt track, then down alley ways and back roads (so many people and children ran from their little homes to wave to us). Then, they took us on the main streets. I felt like I lived there. They took us to their favourite swimming hole, where I went in to wash off some of the dirt. Then, we took the same path back again. I had to clean my glasses several times and our whole body was slowly covering in dirt. It felt so good! Driving a dune buggy is the best thing because it is even more open air than driving a convertible or jeep. They insisted on combining dune buggies with horses, which was really too much for a half day excursion (especially since we made dinner reservations-oops). Riding the horses was so much fun, but maybe would have been more fun if we were clean. They let us gallop on our horses along the beach, which was by far the best part. Since there are so many other reviews on Outback Safari and Bavaro Splash, I will just write to confirm that they are worth the trip. I took gravol before I drove the speed boat on Bavaro Splash and driving the boat over the waves was my second favourite part of the excursions. The Outback Safari was the best opportunity for pictures, dialog, tasting and visiting the country.When asked if my boyfriend would come back to this resort, he said yes!

<Content>Had a Great Time Stayed at the Bavaro from 20 to 27 May with my wife, we are in our 40's.Travel: Flew USA3000 - direct flight from St. Louis. We got our luggage quickly, filled out an paid the tourist fee, and proceeded to past the gauntlet of porters to the Apple rep. The shuttle held about 15 people and took 25 minutes. Very 3rd world country even compared to Mexico. Departure: we had a problem with the ticket agent. Took about 15 minutes to issue a boarding pass and only then because the gal next to him helped. To make matters worse he input our passport numbers wrong and we got pulled 3 separate times in the waiting area to get it fixed (I think when they ran the numbers with U.S. homeland security it red flagged them as bad). That really got me aggravated.Arrival at Resort: When we arrived we were given a banana mama and were told to return in a couple hours. We went to the lobby bar and ordered a drink and before we were finished a room was available. I had sent an email requesting a 2nd floor renovated room, king, as near the beach as possible and we got one on the 2nd row from the beach. We liked the location, walking around the resort is a pleasant experience. Rooms: Stayed in 2384. The A/C in the room was not up to U.S. standards, which others agreed with. Seems to be a bit under sized for the heat load. Fortunately there was a ceiling fan directly over the bed, which we ran 24x7. No thermostat. Room was very clean and the maid didn't come too early. Food: Was very good we felt. The buffet offered lots of choices. Breakfast was great. We often ate lunch at the restaurant by the pool. We ate at the buffet 2 nights but the rest we went to the specialty restaurants. We ate at the Japanese, Cajun, Gourmet,, and Mediterranean - listed in the order we rated them. All were good though, no complaints. On the nights we did not have a guaranteed reservation, checked after 2pm for a cancellation and one of the restaurants always had some. If you can't find something to eat here to your taste, and something is available all hours, then you are a very picky person. Air conditioning in the specialty restaurants is sweet, just like home. Nice and refreshing break from the humidity. Pool: Nice pool and swim up bar, although the bar only serves generic liquor. Only the lobby bar serves top shelf stuff, and you need to ask for it. I drank mostly Stoly vodka all week. The pool never seemed very crowded. Always appeared to have plenty of loungers available. Only a few obnoxious americans during our stay, which were an embarassment to the U.S.Beach: This is where we spent most of our time. Never had a problem finding a palapa, anywhere on the beach. Sand is like powder, very nice. Snorkeled a couple of days in front of the resort (their equipment -get at the dive shack for 1 hour at a time). Water clear, saw a decent variety of fish. Lots of topless women laying out, also saw smaller numbers walking up and down the beach. Surprisingly nice looking and there were enough around that my wife also felt comfortable participating. We felt there were definitely more Europeans than US/Canadians. Everyone was courteous though, no problems. Took several walks on the beach 30 to 40 minutes one way, lots of other walkers so never felt concerned. This resort definitely nicer than the others we looked at that are near it.Staff: Really friendly people. Appreciated it if you spoke even a little Spanish. Lobby bar staff amazingly attentive (all were for that matter). Got good Cohiba's there for only $5US - real bargain. Grounds: Very well kept and no trash at all. They appear to be rehabbing about 10 of the units, but the construction is unobtrusive and they don't start until around 9 in the morning. If I had a suggestion it would be to install more and larger fans in the common areas to move the air.We had a great time here. Weather cooperated, several days got overcast in the afternoon but no rain during the day. The only glitch was my wife got sick the last day and a half, digestive tract thing. Still not over it. We ate the same stuff so not sure what bug she got that I did not. Happened to another woman we met also, she was sick several days.

<Content>Great resort for families This was our first visit to Punta Cana and the Iberostar Bavaro. The resort is beautiful. The lanscaping is impressive and they are constantly working to keep the place clean. We emailed our room requests and most of them were meant. Here is our take;Check in: Quick and painless. The front desk staff was very polite and spoke english.Rooms: We requested a renovated second floor room with a king bed, close to the pool/beach with ocean view if possible. We got everything but the ocean view and renovated room. This place is huge and it helped we were only 100 feet from the pool!Beach/pool: Both were great. We liked how the pool was set up with gradual entry. The kids pool was great! My 2.5 yr old son loved it. The beach was beautiful. My son preferred the pool so we didn't spend as much time on the beach as we would have liked. I think this is their off season so lounge chairs were not a problem, but you will need to save your chair early in the morning if you want a prime location.Food: Ok to Good. The alacarte restaruant's were very good. The buffet was good and there was variety but the menu definitely had a European slant. Even items like hamburgs and hot dogs didn't taste the same as home. No problems for my wife and I but my son didn't eat well. His best meal was at Wendy's in the PC airport.Activities/Excurisons: There was always something going on, target shooting, water polo, bocce, darts, you name it. We didn't go on any excursions because of our 2.5 yr old son but we here the outback safari is a big hit. We have stayed at the Riu Playacar and Riu Palace in Playa Del Carmen in the past and IB Barvaro falls in between those properties. I would recommend this resort. We hope to get back in a few years.

<Content>Fantastic, You Have To Visit!!!!!! Myself and my wife have just returned from our honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. The resort was absolutely fantastic, when we arrived we were moved to a room by the beach which was great. We were only a few seconds walk the beach, the pool and one of the restaurants. The pool was amazing, it was never too busy, there was always seats beside the water or in the shade. The pool bar was great, you can swim up to the bar, order your drink and sit and relax in the water with your drink. It was so nice and something different. The staff were so friendly, we couldn't say a bad word about any of them. They always had a smile which was so nice to see. They all spoke a few different languages so communication was not a problem. The room was really nice, there was a bit of a musky smell in the room at first but you could expect this with the heat, its not bad at all and you get used to it. The maid made up the room everyday and re-stocked the fridge, we left her a few dollars each day. There were loads of restaurants to choose from, we only ate in the buffet each night, my wife is a vegetarian and the speciality restaurants did not have anything on the menu for her. The buffet was really good, they had plenty of food to choose from and the food was quite nice. The weather when we were they was nice, it was 30 degrees everyday and it only rained one day (lucky for us we were on a snorkeling trip so we were wet anyway). The beach was amazing, it was so clean, the sand wasn't hot so you could walk bare foot, the water was perfect. The hotel has an area of the water sectioned off so that you have a safe swimming area that the boats cannot enter into. Each day you can rent snorkeling gear, a boat for an hour. There are always loads of activities to take part in. The grounds of the resort are amazing, it is well maintained and always clean and tidy. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone, if you are looking fo a romantic honeymoon or a relaxing holiday I would look no further than the Dominican Republic. We will definitely be returning in the future, we had an amazing time and if you decide to visit you will to. The night life wasn't great but once you meet people you'll have great time. I hope that this review was helpful

<Content>Third time and I still love it My Mother and I just spent a week at the Iberostar Bavaro (May 18 - May 25) and loved it! This was our third stay there, which is saying alot since we have never repeated at a resort before. We just keep on coming back every couple of years. We went Go-Go tours for the first time and our only complaint was the flights back and forth on USAirways. Lots of delays and transfers in Charlotte made getting back and forth missrable. USair3000 with Apple Vacations is the best way to get back and forth.We stayed in room 1292 and highly recommend it. Remodled, no smell and very close to the beach. It is a garden view and on the first floor but you are just steps away from the beach. You enter the beach right by the beach bar and there is a foot and body shower right there. The first floor was great for my 75 year old mother. The grounds are as clean and beautiful as ever. You constantly see workers out cleaning, pruning and raking the beach. The only thing not clean about the place are the tourists. For some reason smokers can't seem to get the concept of ashtrays and insisted on putting out their buts in the sand. One lady actually caught her cover up skirt on fire because of careless smoking!We never got to the pool this time because the beach was so peaceful and beautiful. If you are looking for music and action go to the pool. If you are looking for relaxing, snoozing and sunning go to the beach. The sand is great, nothing to step on and hurt bare feet.The water is best in the morning, in the afternoon it got rougher and a little seaweedy. You still could see your feet on the ocean floor at all times.We had great weather. Only one sprinkle and thunderstorm. Nothing really to speak of. It is very hot and humid this time of year but there is a breeze that comes off the ocean that makes it bearable.As repeat stayers we received some extra perks so e-mail the resort ahead of time and let them know you are coming back again. Everyone who works there is friendly and as helpful as can be. They try their hardest to make your stay enjoyable. We never wanted for anything. The lobster salad at the gourmet restaurant is great and I adore the Japanese restaurant. Look for the baby peacocks when you are at the Japanese restaurant. By the end of the week I was ready for home cooking, but all in all, for an all inclusive the food is very good.

<Content>Loved this resort! My husband and I are big Iberostar fans. The Bavaro was exactly what we hoped for. The beach is beautiful as are the pools. The rooms are not overly fancy, but certainly clean, modern and comfortable.In terms of food, we thought it was above average, always expecting mediocre at an all-inclusive. The buffet certainly offered the most choices, but the speciality restaurants were good too (you don't go to the DR for Japanese food, after all!) My advice would be to make your reservations for the speciality restaurants the first morning you are there (ask what time the desk opens and be there early - there is usually a line.) Also, we were able to get extra reservations to the speciality restaurants when they were not full - you should always ask...We would steak out our beach area before breakfast and secure a location under umbrellas with our towels (which you obtain with your 'towel card' - ask for your towel card when you first check in at the front desk) - otherwise if the resort is crowded, you don't have many seating options. They tell you this type of behavior is not allowed, but everyone seems to do it, and if you don't, you can get stuck.We thought the staff was helpful and polite. The grounds were perfect and they were constantly working on them. The week we were there we never left the resort. We can't wait until our kids are old enough to return!!!

<Content>Great resort! My family and I have been to Punta Cana over ten times and this was our best experience yet! This is a great resort. General FacilitiesTop notch. The grounds are very lush and pristinely maintained. You feel like you're walking around in paradise. If you are a bird lover - there are peacocks roaming around and lots of other birds in the ponds near the main restaurant. Beautiful pool. We walked over to the other Iberostar properties next door and while they are also nice, felt that the Iberostar Bavaro is definitely superior. BeachWhite sand and very clean. The ocean is good for swimming - but has some small waves. Lots of palapas (straw umbrellas) on the beach for shade - there are signs saying you can't reserve them but everyone does. Usually people go out around 7-7:30 if they want a premium location but loungers/palapas can be found all day. RoomsThe rooms are not over the top but are very nice with marble bathrooms, a minibar, and a nice chaise lounge/bankette on the balcony. Food/RestaurantsThe food is of remarkably quality - especially at the a la carte restaurants. Service was always prompt and friendly. For breakfast there is pretty much anything you could ask for - from french toast, pancake and waffle stations, omelettes, fresh fruit and pastries. The resort tries really hard to cater to both its North American and European guests and there are lots of options. We tried the Gourmet, Cajun and Mediterranean restaurants. All of them were very good but our favourites were the Gourmet and the Cajun. The lobster salad at the Gourmet is great! The menus are all posted near the restaurants if you want to check them out. For the lunch and dinner buffets, they do tend (like all all-inclusives) to get a little repetitive. However there is always a variety of options and we found the seafood - especially the calamari and fish - to be exceptionally good. On Friday there was lobster at the buffet. Check with the reservation desk to find out when it is - previously it was Wednesdays. GuestsA variety - young and old, couples and familities, Americans, Canadians, Europeans. Some reviews said that the Europeans were rude - I didn't find this at all. A great resort for families and couples but is probably too lowkey for most singles. Definitely recommend this resort!

<Content>Amazing Time! I recently stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from May 10th-17th. This is going to be a long review because I read many reviews on this website and I felt they helped me very much. I traveled there with my fiance and two of our friends. We are all in our mid 20's. Travel: we flew USA3000, which is a direct flight. We were served a meal and as well as snack on the flight, which I thought went beyond what is expected in a four hour trip. When we got to the airport, we took a picture with two local women (which you can purchase before you leave for 8 dollars). We collected our luggage and were directed to our applevacation shuttle. Yes, there are porters who quickly grab your luggage and bring them to your shuttle, we expected this and gave them a buck a piece per luggage. This is a poor country and it is better than them stealing our luggage. The time spent at the airport is only about 20 minutes. Shuttle to Iberostar: The ride took 25 minutes and was in a very nice air conditioned bus. I had read some reviews about the ride being scary because they saw people with guns sitting on the side of the road and the driver was crazy. Well, there are guards (from the army) on the side of the road and are there to protect tourists. Yes, they do drive crazy but I never felt the driver was out of control or that we were in danger. Other than this, there really is nothing to see from the airport to the resort because the closest city is Santa Domingo. Arrival at Resort: When we arrived we were given a banana mama, non-alcoholic, and since we got there at 12:30, we were told to return in a couple hours because there were only two rooms available at the time. the rest of the people set off to eat lunch and check out the resort, but I stayed because our room happened to be ready. My fiance and I as well as our friends sent an email request to the resort in advance for a room close to the ocean, and that is what we received. Rooms: I stayed in 2354. The thing I was worried about most from reading reviews posted previously, was the musty smell in the rooms. I tried and tried to find a smell in my room that could be considered anything but normal, but was unable to. I even brought air fresheners but did not need them. The room temperature was perfect as there is a control switch next to the bed. The room was clean, and was only dirty after we walked around and brought in sand on a daily basis. sorry the maid only cleans once a day, don't know what other people are expecting, but I find that is adequate. We tipped the maid a buck a day and received plenty of water, we even requested additional water, and we had 5 or 6 bottles of water to drink a day. There is also a gallon of water which we used to brush our teeth with, once it was empty, it was refilled the next day. There is a sign that says the fridge will only be refilled every other day, but ours was filled daily. Unless you stay in your room all day drinking water, what is provided is plenty, as you can drink water from the bars throughout the resort. Food: Amazing variety and quality. Lets start with my favorite, breakfast. Every morning I had an omellete, french toast, and a glass of OJ. My lack of variety did not stem from the lack of choices available: fish, donoughts, toast, bacon, eggs, meats, cereal, yogurt, etc. Trust me, there is something for everybody. For LUNCH we ate by the main pool which had once again, a lot of variety to choose from. My favorite was a pasta bar they had set up. you choose the type of pasta, type of sauce, and what you want in it, and they cook it for you on the spot. Each day they did have fish, burgers, hot dogs, fries, chicken nuggets, pizza. i really thought the burgers tasted great. My favorite part of lunch was the soft serve ice cream machine, I would get two small cones every day. Dinner: we ate at the cajun, french (gourmet), steak, and japanese. My favorite was the cajun, but all were very good. I particularly enjoyed how at each restaraunt, the staff dressed to the style of food being served. I always tried to try different things, such as sushi at the Japanese, blackened grouper at the cajun (which was my favorite meal, GET THIS if you aer there), duck at the gourmet, and a ribeye at the steak. the steak house is outside, located at the same place by the pool where you eat lunch. I had read complaints about the time it took to be served. Well I found that unlike Burger King, they cook your food to order. We were in and out of each place in about an hour, which I thought was perfect. OTHER meals can be eaten throughout the day as there is 24hour room service. we did take advantage of this a few times, and were pleased with the response time and quality of the of the food. Pool: the pool is large and hardly ever seems crowded. there is a pool bar where my friends liked to hang out and throw a frisbee around. there is a section for kids and section for activities such as vball, bball, and water polo. Beach: This is where I spent most of my day. After breakfast I would enjoy reading on the beach, always got a front row palapa, never got to the beach before 10, and still enjoyed a great spot. There are topless women walking around and then there were european men who thought they ought to wear less clothes than the women. Sorry, but guys do not need to see other guys junk. this is where I will talk about the biggest complaint I had, which the resort could control if it wanted to. Smokers.. the beach is not your ash tray, and the ocean is not your butt-disposal. It does not matter if they were european or not, even though it seemed like all europeans smoked, but smoking is disgusting and the resort should ban it completely. Ocean: beautiful, had small waves, and the temp. was perfect. The resort offered kayak'ing, wind surfing, and other non-motorized water sports available that each person was allowed to use for one hour a day. Staff: the best part of the trip, i might have said this before, but seriously the best part of the trip was meeting and seeing the delight of the staff. The Starz who were always getting people involved in staying active had so much energy and were always friendly and having fun. It never felt like they did not want to be there doing what they were doing. Rafael at the lobby bar and little papi at the main buffet, were the friendliest I encountered. The nightly shows put on in the evening were very entertaining. We went every night and had some drinks and watched the show. If you are expecting broadway shows, well go to broadway, and do not complain because the show was too cheeezy. The entertainers were always having fun and always tried to get people to have fun, be it dancing, getting people involved. Really what else can you ask at a resort? To me, I greatly appreciated the effort put in every night by the staff. Overall: you have to be used to some serious luxurious style of living in order to complain about the services provided by the iberostar Bavaro. I know I have missed some wonderful things about this resort but there are just so many. So take complaints with a grain of salt and just expect a wonderful relaxing vacation.

<Content>Overall a 4 star resort I am going to give my opinion on those things that I think are most important to me when I am on vacation, which are:1. Food - excellent, plenty of choices that can accomodate the most picky and well dined person like myself. Fresh fruit or freshly squeezed juices are available all the time. The only so so thing were the desserts, there were plenty of them but noone seem to take any.2. The beach- fantastic. Warm water and perfectly white sand. The beach is wide and long. Lots of people just stroll the beach up and down (topless). The waves are moderate, so don't expect a perfectly still water. Yet not big enought to boogie board.3. The hotel facilities - just OK. I was not impressed by the lobby or the overall amenities. There was no WOW factor. Bummer that the spa and gym were a long stroll away in another section of Iberostar ( Dominicana). The rooms were nice and clean but again nothing spectacular with a water view. The whole hotel felt very comfortable, like being at home. Being in room 1221, the beach, the pool and restaurants were all very close so pick your rooms carefully.4. Entertainment - Excellent! Every night there was a new and very impressive show. I have a dancing background so I judge shows like a dancer. They met and exceeded my expectations.All dancers were giving it a 110 percent. The show is long because everything is translated in 4 languages: Spanish, English a, French and German. There were lots of European tourists.5. Kids Club. All of you who travel with kids. This is a life saver you can drop off your child for one hour (free) and go have your relaxing dinner or hire a babysitter.I hope my 5 cents were worthwhile.

<Content>Beautiful Resort I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from May 3-8, 2007. I went with a group of friends. I found the property to be one of the cleanest I've seen. The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive. The grounds were lushed and well maintained. There were peacocks and other wild life that roam the grounds freely. That added to tropical atmosphere. They do expect you to tip so take plenty of dollar bills. The food in my opinion was just ok. I had to find what I liked and I just stuck to it. I got a chance to eat at every specialty restuarant. My favorite was the Japanese. They do have a policy of how many times you can eat at a speciality restuarant but if you are nice they do not seem to enforce it. I agree with the previous reviewer about 2 things. You do have to ask for top shelf liquor (if you care about that kind of stuff) and there were many european visitors that I found to be very rude. Not all of them. Most of them were very nice but there was some there that made us feel uncomfortable. That has nothing to do with the hotel and I wouldn't let that dissaude you. The beach was beautiful and there is a small straw market just on the other side of the beach. They can get a little aggressive but that's their livlihood. You can negotiate your price. It is a Spanish speaking country but for the most part you could communicate with them. The people you needed to communicate with the most spoke English. It wouldn't hurt to brush up on your high school Spanish. They could beef up their entertainment but there is a Las Vegas review type show every night. TIP- If you have Verizon Wireless you can use your cell phone there. You will pay a roaming charge but if you have to stay connected as I do I think it is good thing to know. The other tip is if you plan to take young children beware of topless women. At the beach there is a topless option but at the pool your are suppose to keep your top on. That policy was not enforced. Overall I would recommend the hotel.

<Content>Best Vacation yet Me and my boyfriend stayed at the IB from May 6th- 13th and we had the best vacation! We stayed at the Iberostar Paraiso Beach in Mexico last year and we loved it and wanted to stay in the Iberostar chain. We both like this resort a little better for a few reasons.  The facility itself is beautiful! Just the perfect size (IB mexico was a little TOO big) We asked for a renovated room, king size bed on the second floor and we got it. We even got a phone call on our second night asking if everything was ok with the room!  The weather was pretty good. It rained a little more than we would have liked but for the most part it was sunny and HOT.  Beach was the most beautiful we've ever seen. We are definately beach people and spent most of our time here. The pool was great also. We usually went there around 2 in the afternoon to start drinking at the great swim up bar. It was a little dirty over by the bar, but whatever... it was still nice! Food at the buffet was good for all inclusive. The Ala carte's were great! We ate at Jumbalaya( cajian), the Steakhouse, and Gourmet. All were great!  Overall we had a great relaxing vacation. Make sure you tip the maids and bartenders and those who go the extra mile! Those star friends work SO hard! Have a good time!!

<Content>Would not go back We visited the resort in mid-March with a group of seven. One person in our group recommended the resort, but you have to take recommendations with a grain of salt - it depends on the person's perspective. We have been on four Sandal's vacations and loved everything about them. Good food, top shelf liquor, friendly and attentive staff - to name just a few of the reasons that Sandal's is superior in every way to Iberostar.The grounds and common area buildings were nice. The rooms were musty because the A/C is on a motion sensor. Unfortunately, so is the refrigerator, so don't expect a cold drink unless it's first thing in the morning. They tell you not to drink the tap water, but then only provide four bottles of water (and only restock the fridge every other day). The bed is not comfortable and the pillows are about 2 inches thick. The pool water was filthy by the swim-up bar - hair, debris, straws, you name it - floating around. The rest of the pool was fine. They have a kiddie pool, but don't enforce the use, so diapered children were allowed in the main pool. The food was average at best. You could always find something to eat that was good, but forget about a variety of delicious food. Sit-down restaurant reservations were based on the number of nights you were staying, so you are forced to eat at the buffet - whether you like it or not. Even though they have empty seats in the restaurants, they still won't let you in. It's not exactly what I'd call all inclusive. The drinks were OK, but the call brand liquor was kept out of sight. They'd give it to you if you asked, but if you didn't, you were given the crap liquor. Most of the staff was friendly, but unlike Sandal's, they really do EXPECT tips. Unfortunately, even though I tipped several bartenders very well ($20), they didn't provide better service. I remember two bartenders that were very attentive, though, so be careful who you tip! It may not be worth it!The second night our room key didn't work. I walked back to the front desk, which was quite a way from our room, to tell them. I went back and waited 15 minutes, but nobody came to help. I walked back to the lobby again and told our Apple rep, Carlos. Maintenance arrived before I returned. The same thing happened to one of the other couples were were with. The next day, we were give an small bottle of rum and a fruit plate, I assume for our trouble. I put the rum in the refrigerator and it was missing when we returned from our snorkeling excursion. I told Carlos about it, but nothing was ever done about it. My wife was also missing some expensive make-up. So be careful - they'll go through your drawers and take what they want. The snorkeling excursion was not worth $75. They have a bar set up in the back with, of course, crap liquor and beer, and then serve it to you in 3 ounce cups. Of course, they expect a tip every time you go back. For lunch, they brought around a tray with scary-looking lunchmeat, rubber cheese and stale bread - and you made your own sandwich - nothing else. A real waste of money.The pool deck is concrete and extremely slippery. I walked at a snail's pace and still slipped several times. They need to correct that somehow. The beach was nice and the water was great. Get up at 6:30 am if you want a hut. Get out there by 7:00 am if you want a lounge chair. There are a lot of Europeans. They had no qualms about cutting in line and being rude - particularly the French. Not all of them, but a lot of them.Brush up on your Spanish or you may not be able to communicate with all of the staff. But hey, it's their country, so don't expect them to speak English! Overall - this place can't hold a candle to a Sandal's resort. Spend the same money and go to a Sandal's resort.

<Content>Hola--This is the best vacation we have had in years. Hola. When can we go back is what we are trying to figure out. We just returned our stay 4/29鈥?/4 at the Iberostar Bavaro Suites in Punta Cana and this was the best, most relaxing vacation we have had in years. We had recommendations from a couple of friends and booked our trip online using FunJet. I think that the only thing we would do differently is to try harder to find a direct flight. You can find some of our pictures at this URL: http://travel.webshots.com/album/558940399EsLFjFROOMS: The suite was very comfortable and the maids kept the rooms clean and the minibar filled with beer, water and soft drinks. We tipped them daily and provided some small gifts. We emailed the resort about 1 week before arrival asking for a second floor room with king bed near the pool and ocean. They did respond that they could not guarantee a room assignment, but would put the request in our file. We were pleasantly surprised when we were escorted to the room we requested in a building on the ocean (just facing toward the resort). If you look at the maps of the resort and see building numbers, the 3-digit numbers can be related to the rooms. There are 8 rooms per building鈥攚e were in building 234; room number was 2344.FOOD: The food was great and varied both at the main buffet and at the pool. This is a Spanish hotel chain and the food has a European flavor. It reminded us of the 4 years we lived in Germany. We found a couple of waiters (Gregori and Delmis) in the main buffet that were great and we sat at their station at breakfast and dinner all week. We did tip the wait staff some at each meal but I don鈥檛 believe that it would have affected service if we had not.. They were very friendly and filled our glasses too often. We would recommend this approach鈥攐ne station all week. They had a different theme each day at both buffets. The drinks were always flowing. We took the Bubba Keg, but used it only for ice water.A LA CARTE Restaurants: We ate at the Gourmet Restaurant鈥攊t was a great break from the buffet half way through our vacation. We both had beef tenderloin. We did not use our other choice of an a la carte restaurant.BEACH: We were both raised in San Diego and love the beach. If you like to body surf and want waves, this is not the vacation location for you. It had lots of white, soft sand with plenty of palapas and loungers. We took an early walk each morning and selected the same palapa every day. There was always a place to sit, maybe not on the first row. We snorkeled off the resort beach (take some bread or a banana for the fish) and found it very interesting.POOL: We usually moved to the pool about 4PM for a little bit. Did not have any problems finding a lounger. I tried the scuba demonstration鈥攖heir point was to sell lessons and excursions. I did not have a problem with this, just did not want to spend the remainder of my vacations taking classes to get certified. They offer a referral program where you can do the book and pool work at home and complete the open water on vacations. I am seriously thinking about doing this before my next vacations to the DR. It would be more fun to the open water in the DR instead of a murky Virginia lake or quarry.EXCURSIONS: We took Bavaro Splash excursion. This is small 2-person boat that you drive (in line with about 10 other couples) to a platform to snorkel. They provide the equipment. This was great fun and we had a guide in the water that took some pictures of us with a water camera. They sell a picture of you in the boat for $8鈥攖ake some cash with you.CASINO: We played the nickel slots a couple of times. Wife won her money back and some of mine. Not much going on at the casino in the early evening.GROUNDS: Lots and lots of peacocks, which are great alarm clocks. They tend to roost near the main lobby area. I would imagine that buildings in this are may be noisy. The ground crew was always working to keep everything neat and clean. Disney is no match for these guys.STAFF: Everyone was very friendly and worked hard to make our stay wonderful. Learn a few Spanish phases鈥攖hey really appreciate your attempts. Most know some English and will trying very hard to understand your requests. We witnessed many staff members talking in Spanish, English, German and French one right after another. Gregori and Delmis (our main buffet waiters) always tried to teach us some Spanish each meal.We have been going to the Outer Banks of North Carolina for years-rent a house on or near the beach. We have decided that this is too much work鈥攜ou still have to make meals and clean up or go out to dinner (more $$$$$). We will go back to Punta Cana and the Iberostar Bavaro鈥攖his was a great place for us.Pat and Jerry, thanks for recommending this vacation and hotel!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Fabulous Getaway!!! Just returned from our stay 4/26-4/30 at the Iberostar Bavaro Suites in Punta Cana and can say with all honesty that we will go back!! Itdid not feel too crowed but plenty of people were there. We booked our trip in Feb. after research here on TA and with our travel agent. All in all it was a great vacation getaway.ROOMS:The suites are lovely- we emailed a request, for a second floorroom, non-smoking king size bed, which was granted. I asked for a renovated room when we got there and we were accomodated without delay. The primary difference between a renovated and non-renovated room was the bathroom - new tiled extra large showers, also the furniture has been reburbished and the closet doors changed. Both are fine but second room had a better location (more central). I would reccommend asking for a 2nd floor room, more private and if you are near the peacocks, I did see them on tables of some first floor rooms.FOOD: Always plentiful at either buffet or pool bar. It got a little monotonous but plenty of variety and fine overall. Remember they are feeding MANY people but plently off fresh fruit and always something available made to order. A LA CARTE Restaurants:We ate at the Steakhouse and Japanese, both of which were fine. The Japanese had a fun atmosphere and food was tasty. Ate at Gourmet our last night. What a way to end our vacation!The best food by far, my filet mignon had to be close to a half pound and wonderful! We were able to make reservations with no problems and even got an extra a la carte meal due to cancellations.BEACH: Incredible! Smooth sand, plenty of palapas and loungers. Whilewe did go early to the beach - by 8:30 always got a palapa with no problem. To us its a beach vacation and we wanted to be on the beach early. People do reserve but we did not find it a problem. Again, I think it is not really high season so not very crowded. Topless bathing is allowed at the beach and many take advantage (lots of Europeans). Most people are very tasteful and its not a big deal. But I was glad our tween/teen sons were not there as I think it may have made them uncomfortable because they are not used to it. POOL:Lovely and well kept, cleaned everyday. Lots of loungers but harder to get one poolside if not early. More kids at the pool. The swim up bar is so fun! Thanks Danilo!GROUNDS:Gorgeous and well kept. Lots of peacocks near the buffet which wa interested. They can be very loud at sunset and in early AM.STAFF:All were friendly and appeared happy (singing and dancing) and very helpful. Requests were met with no problem and most spoke English to a certain degree. Many speak French and German as well. A willingness to speak Spanish goes a long way, even if you don't always get it right! Remember, Spanish is the official language of the Dominican Rep. and this is a Spanish hotel chain. English speakers are the foreigners there! We tipped waiters, bartenders, housekeeping, spa attendants etc. The exchange rate is US $1 to RD $32 so our $ are in demand. NO ONE ever asked for a tip but were very appreciative.OVERALL:A wonderul and relaxing getaway and we 'll go back as soon as we can!

<Content>wonderful spring break Our family of 4 stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from April 8-15th. We flew direct from St. Louis. No problems with customs or airport..Arriveed early to Punta Cana.Had about 90minute wait before our room was ready. We e mailed ahead and got a newer room near the pool. Room was nice. There was an odd odor in the bathroom but we got used to it The maid was very good to us while we were there. Filled the frig with whatever we asked.Let a small gift and a few dollars every day. The grounds were very well kept and the beach was awesome.soft white sand and the water was beautiful.We stayed around the resrt and relaxed for 4 days and tried some excursions on the other. There was plenty to do at the resort and I never got tired of laying on the beach reading or playing cards.Did get a massage on the beach it was nice I think $1/minute. Also went parasailing and rode the banana boats several times. Went to Catalina island on the excursion. Went on to dives. There was also snorkeling and a beautiful beach to relax on.My wife and 10 year old daughter went to swim with the dolphins. Got there early and had a good time.Went on a few other dives. Both were good.My daughter did a discover diving lesson and dive. Andre the divemaster did very well with her She got sea sick on the way out. We did not make our reservations on the first day and thus did nt get all the resterauts we wanted.The buffet was great though. It was different every night.. Lots of variety. Lots of fruits you don't see in the states.The trip home was without incident also. Moved quickly through the airport. All of the buses were very prompt for all pickups for the entire trip. We had a great vacation.One suggestion would be to bring a little more cash than you need and lots of small bills. Some things like parasailing are cash only and when you pay in big bills you get Dominican money back. Also the staff was very friendly and most spoke enough English to help you out. I carried some $1 s in my poket all the time for drink tips.They were not expected but you could tell they were appreciated

<Content>Great Family Time - Tips for Parents We stayed the last week of April with our 2 children who are 10 and 6. I'll just add a few key points to the previous reviews.1) The food is average. Even at the reserved restaurants. However, given our experience with all-inclusive's we didn't expect gourmet.2) The Peacocks are LOUD and annoying at 6:00 am!!!!! Get a room closer to the pool. They seem to hang out closer to the front of the hotel.3) The pool is great for kids. A lot of people leave their floats.4) The evening shows are average to boring. Mr. Iberostar was the best and they should do more audience participation. One show, Chicago, was completely inappropriate for children. It started off with a seductive dance, followed by a bedroom scene which includes adultery, physical abuse and murder. We walked out after that, so I don't know how the rest was.5) The beach is great and you can snorkel just a few feet out.6) It rained more than we liked. It appears that their rainy season decided to start a couple of weeks early. Bring umbrellas and rain jackets if you come this time of year.7) Not a lot of variety of food for kids. The chicken nuggets were frequently over fried. Yes, deep fried in the french fry oil!8) Our renovated room had a bathtub with a spray handle and the glass door had been removed and replaced with a shower curtain. I've seen parents complain about both, so obviously they listened.9) Lots of kids to make friends with. We have used kids clubs in the past, but this one seemed to be more focused on kids under 5, so my kids didn't go much.10) The rooms are best for families with 2 children under 12. Families of 5 or more or teens will probably need 2 rooms.Have Fun!!

<Content>Wonderful solo vacation I went on vacation to the Iberostar Bavaro for 4 nights (4/17-4/21) by myself after a bad breakup. The sun, sand, beautiful water and peaceful surroundings were just what I needed. The facilities are well kept and tasteful, and the staff works hard to make everything enjoyable. It was enjoyable for me to see people of all ages enjoying the wonderful resort with their loved ones. Definitely a good representation of European vacationers, which was nice. Also fun were the many peacocks that live on the large property and provide entertainment and enhanced scenery! I have no complaints about food, room accomodations or service. I have read other negative reviews, and obviously in a resort that size there are going to be some technical problems, but it seems that some travelers are just not accustomed to the tropical climate, and the appropriate smells/environment that goes with living in that temperature/humidity. I thought everything was clean and well attended. One warning: I went on the Marinarium excursion after being convinced by the Apple rep at the resort that it was a wonderful trip. I had read on Trip Advisor that the Marinarium was sad and not a natural snorkeling experience. This is true!!! The poor nurse sharks and sting rays are kept in small caged areas in the middle of the open water, with a huge pack of tourists kicking each other and struggling to take underwater photos of the animals huddling in corners of the cages. Also, the reef or coral is absolutely unimpressive. I would instead opt for the general snorkeling tour, even though it has more of a reputation for being a party boat. The plus of the Marinarium tour was a very enthusiastic staff, and at the end they took us to a beautiful cove with chest-high clear beautiful water to swim around in and have drinks. If you need a worry-free beach vacation, this is definitely the place to do it. I plan on going back with my family!

<Content>Absolute Paradise! We (a family of 4, 2 children ages 9  7) returned from the Ibersotar Bavaro on Apr 12 after 14 WONDERFUL days. We put in some requests before we left and they were all accomodated upon our arrival. The Punta Cana airport was a breeze to get through, in and out within 1/2 hour. Check in was also very fast. This resort is absolutely beautiful, the grounds are immaculate, the beach is huge with the softest sand and true turquoise water. There are many palapas on the beach, even at peak season, we had no trouble getting one. The pool is shallow and warm, and if ever there was debris, it was because of the rude Americans leaving it behind. If you want a spot in the shade at the pool, get one early. People do use towels to reserve their spots, and everyone respects this. The buffets are all very good, we had lunch every day at the beach/pool buffet, lots of casual fare to choose from. The main buffet has a different theme each evening, so although there are the standard things, there is always something different if you are willing to try it! No one should go hungry with all the choices. None of us had stomach issues at any time on the trip, just don't drink the tap water, and use bottled for brushing your teeth. The water at the restaurants is fine to drink. Others commented on weak bar drinks, not so for us, if you ask for rum, they put LOTS in, so just ask! The people there will do anything if you just ask them nicely, they are very happy to make your stay a plesant one.The a la carte restaurants at the Bavaro are all very good, our favorites were the Japanese and Mediteranian. We didn't care for the Mexican. Do make your reservations early. We tried 2 at the Dominicana, they were not as good--pay the extra $$ and stay at the Bavaro, it is worth it! The rooms are spacious and very clean, no bugs and no odour to speak of--just that tropical smell from the humidity that you will have anywhere in the carribean! We left tips and gifts for our maids, and they always left what we asked for (extra water etc). We used the safe to lock up our passports etc, but I have very expensive camera equipment, and never felt uncomfortable about leaving it out. Nothing was ever out of place. If you take gifts for the maids, leave a note for them with your room number so they can leave the resort with it. We took 3 excursions, the absolute best was the Bavaro Runners full day tour of Punta Cana. We saw the true Dominican people, went to a sugar cane field, a cocoa bean plantation, underground caves, a ranch for horseback riding, a school and learned so much about the area. It was a fasinating day and not too long for the kids. We also went on the Mariniarium tour to snorkle with sharks and rays. This was fun and a good experience also. The Jurassic Buggies tour (a dune buggy trip for 1 1/2 hours) was fun, but over priced for what we did. There is a flea market just down the beach, these people are fun and friendly. They will entice you into their shops, but are not pushy at all. Pay 1/2 to 1/3 of the first price they give you, they will deal. The prices at the resort shops are reasonable by these standards. There are lots of things to do during the day, snorkling at the resort is quite good. There is a dive center right on the beach, they have several locations to dive at which my husband really enjoyed. There is parasailing, kyaking, banana boats, all the usual stuff. I had a 1 hour massage on the beach, a real treat! They do have a full service spa if you require other services. Plenty for children to do as well. My kids didn't go to the Mini club as we enjoy hanging out together, but we saw them many times and the kids looked like they were having alot of fun! Belle works with the kids and she is fantastic. We never saw the adult evening shows, but the kids shows and disco looked fun. The lobby bar is a fun place to sit and have a drink at before or after dinner, lots going on there. The people at the resort work very hard, so bring tips for them. The rule is: if you hand it directly to them, they can keep it, if you leave it on the table, it goes into a pool for all of them. At the buffet we sat in the same section each day and always had the same servers, so we tipped them directly. They do get to know you are will remeber you. (tips or not) Overall I would rate this vacation 10/10, everything was perfect from beginning to end. My husband thought 14 days would be too long, but NONE of us were ready to leave this place, it is absolute paradise! We can't wait to return next year!!

<Content>Loved the IB Bavaro Loved the Iberostar Bavaro, I used the trip advisor to help make my decision to go there. Very clean, well mainicured resort. They don't speak much English, however, the entire staff was very accomodating. Food was very good, plenty to eat. The ala cart restaurants were excellent. Not too many kids compared to the neighboring resorts, which was fine by me. If you want to save a few bucks, the IB Dominicana and IB Punta Cana were nice as well, however they share the same pools and seems to have more kids and more people, they just don't have the upscale restaurants and junior suites. Still very nice, however, I perfered the quiteness of the IB Bavaro. I would definitely go back the IB Bavaro resort. The beaches were beautiful, the warm was warm and clear. Please be sure the tip the staff, they work so hard, morning into the night!!

<Content>Would not return My husband  I booked our trip on 4/13 through our travel agent based on the recommendation of a friend who went during Christmas week. We were left on our own upon leaving the plane  trying to locate the correct transfer vehicle from the airport to the hotel.We were taken to the wrong van, several minutes later, we were brought to the correct one. It was all quite confusing  chaotic especially since we did not speak Spanish  no one was interested in speaking English! We listened to very loud rap music during the 30-40 minute drive to the resort. Upon check in,we were given a room w/ 2 double beds. I basically begged for a king  our request was granted when we rechecked after returning from lunch. No other requests for room accommodation were made-no ocean view, no non-smoking room.The room was dark, musty  there was no control as to the comfort level of the air conditioning. The ceiling fan over the bed was either too slow(ineffective) or too fast(causing a huge draft on you while you slept). The oversize shower stall was nice, however, there was a large collection of hair on the drain  small spiders in the corner. My husband stepped on a small piece of glass that was on the bedside throw rug. The room safe did not work. The room refrigerator was not cold so of course, the drinks were not. Finally, three people showed up simultaneously to correct these various problems after I made several continuous calls to the front desk, but alas, no one spoke English, so I spent another 15 minutes on the phone with the front desk reexplaining the problems to them while they then interpreted to the appropriate personnel. We went to the pool to the swim up bar. At 3:00pm, the pool was filled with debris, leaves, dirt, hair etc,  there was several long hairs on the bar where we sat. The drinks both alcoholic and nonalcoholic were horrible @ best. One can make a better pina colada using a grocery store mix. There was either minimal alcohol or watered down drinks which is why there probably were not any out of control, inebriated people there!! The food was average/below average for a resort. At any of the buffets,indoors or out, it was not uncommon to see flies randomly landing here  there on all the food. There was little in the way of American food as we know it. The hamburg tasted very odd. The buffet was very different style food, jellied, spicy,or pickled. Even the desserts were not worth the calories. The fresh fruits were delicious, but we ate too many carbs due to the lack of options. Even at breakfast, the french toast  waffles were soggy. The steaks  grilled chicken at the outdoor luncheon grill was excellent  the cheese pizza was surprisingly good. The gourmet restaurants were delicious, but you are only allowed to go to them based on the number of nights you are staying at the resort-ie, a 4 night stay allows you to make a one night reservation for one of the restaurants. People from the USA were the friendliest of the tourists, the others were rude  didn't mind if you knew it. Was there anything good about our trip?? YES! The weather was incredible-no humidity, sunny  in the 80's. The ocean was an enormous pool of layers of turquoise  warm. You did have to put a towel on your chair by 6:30-7:00am if you wanted ahut to be out of the sun which was rather intense. I had 2 spa body wraps  two 30 minute back/shoulder massages all for the price of what I have paid at some resorts for just 1 massage! A great bargain. The most disconcerting thing that occurred was that on the morning we left, we went to breakfast, leaving our 2 checked luggage bags outside our door as instructed, placed the do not disturb sign on the door, closed the curtains  went to breakfast. My husband left a $10 bill on the table as a tip for our stay. When we returned, our room was the way we left it with one exception-the money was gone  so was my makeup bag, brushes, etc. We already had one experience w/ leaving 2 facecloths in a drawer so we would have extras and later finding them gone, obviously someone had gone through our things. We did file a report, but could not see it through, we had to get to the front of the resort to be picked up for the airport. The bus was 45 mins late  no one kept us informed as to the delay. We got to the airport  wanted to purchase the photo they took of us when we entered the airport upon our arrival  they could not find it nor did they go out of their way to locate it. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!

<Content>A fantastic week! We (a middle-aged couple, one American, one Brit) had a wonderful stay at the Iberostar Punta Cana/Dominicana from April 6th through the 14th. The room was spacious and comfortable, and we were completely satisfied with the service and the meals. The staff was genuinely friendly and greeted us with a smile and an 鈥淗ola鈥?everywhere we went.Our room had two very comfortable (firm-ish) beds, a sofa and table, a TV with enough stations to keep us entertained during the few minutes we were actually in the room, and a mini-bar which was filled every day. The bathroom was spacious, clean, and the shower worked just fine. We had control of the temperature of the room, meaning that we could turn the air conditioner on and off as we saw fit. The balcony had a table and chairs, as well as a small clothesline to hang up our wet things. It was well cleaned every day, and our cleaning lady always decorated our sink with flowers from the garden.The food was varied and catered to both American and European appetites. The breakfast buffet had everything from bacon and eggs to donuts and croissants, as well as oatmeal, yogurt and granola for the health-conscious. There was also a large variety of cheese and cold cuts, hot and cold vegetables, and (my favorite!), lots of local fruit. Freshly-made juices topped it all off. For lunch and dinner, there was again a huge choice of foods, both hot and cold. Sure, you could get things like hot dogs, hamburgers and pizza, but really, folks, you can eat those at home. Why not try something different? The fish was lovely and there was usually some sort of roasted meat in the evening. There were plenty of salads and veggies, including some local vegetables that I hadn鈥檛 seen before. I never ate the same thing twice, and I liked nearly everything I tried.We ate at two of the restaurants鈥攖he tropical and the oriental ones. The oriental was quite good, but I found the regular buffet to be better than the tropical restaurant. Others we spoke to during our trip felt the same.Neither of us had stomach troubles, but I was careful to eat only cooked veggies or raw ones that were peeled. Perhaps I was overly cautious, but I鈥檓 glad I followed those rules.The gardens, pool area and the beaches were lovely. Yes, there was quite a scramble for the reclining chairs at the pool and beach, but we always managed to find a place to sit, even if we didn鈥檛 claim our territory at the crack of dawn. We often went for a dip in the ocean before breakfast, and the crew was already out there making sure the beach was pristine. We snorkeled, sailed a catamaran, and did some windsurfing--all equipment included in the package. The live entertainment in the evening (and the 鈥渁nimaci贸n鈥?in general) was quite amusing. These people worked hard 24/7 to keep us entertained.All in all, the Iberostar staff bent over backwards for us and made us feel most welcome. I do not speak Spanish, but felt well taken care of and truly spoiled by everyone!

<Content>Paradise! Just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro on April 1st. We breezed through the airport and had no problems. The van ride to the hotel took at least 40 minutes, maybe longer because we had to stop at several other hotels first.We have stayed at the Iberostar Paraiso Lindo in Mexico and I was afraid that I would be disappointed but that was not the case.The hotel was beautiful and I loved the open air lobby and restaurants! We traveled with another family and had requested adjoining rooms before we left. When we arrived they did not have 2 rooms together but were able to move us the next day and get us together. Each day we would leave a note for our maid requesting cervesa, soda and bottled water. A little bit of spanish can go a long ways. Make sure to brush up on the important spanish phrases before you go. The weather was a bit windy when we arrived but after that we had perfect weather with lots of sun and blue skies. One recommendation, you can never bring too much sunscreen! Evenings were cooler but we never needed jackets or sweaters.It's a good idea to make your dinner reservations the 1st day. We were able to get all the restaurants and times that we wanted, although we wished later we had chosen 7:30. Our 6:30 time ended up being a bit early. We ate at the Japanese, Mediterranean and Gourmet. They were all good and a nice change from the buffet. After dinner we went to the shows and each us participated in some of the games. Embarassing but fun! The best drink that we discovered was the coco loco with a shot of coffee liquor.The pool was very nice but the beach was fabulous. We walked an hour 1 way and could have gone much further. The sand is white, very soft and the water is the perfect blue color. Every morning there were lots of people walking on the beach and we always felt safe.We had a great time and would highly recommend this hotel. The only bummer was coming back to Minneapolis and facing a high of 17 degrees!

<Content>Wouldn't go back We stayed with a large group for 7 nights. The hotel grounds are beautiful as is the beach. Food was plentiful but just okay. All the children we travelled with at some point had some stomach issues, they did not drink the water, we were told that they should not use the tap water at all, so we brushed teeth with bottled water. The hotel grounds are very large and therefore when you are travelling with children not an easy task to keep an eye. There are no organized activities for children, no pool games, etc. We hardly saw the star friends for the children and they were not accommodating in this fashion. I would not go back and be weary if you are travelling with children, as I feel it was not a children friendly place. The staff was also not that friendly and were not accommodating. I would not go back.

<Content>Wonderful Experience Sorry for writing it to late, but here it goes! The hotel is great, and the staff even better! My husband and I had a great time for eight days and our first thought was too many days.....but it was not, the days went by very quickly and soon we were flying back home, the next time I will stay for 10 days at least!THE ROOMS: first o all they have bungalows and they are not buildings with all the rooms, so every bungalows had 8 rooms very well kept, clean and renovated. the bathrooms are very nice and they do clean them daily very good. we had a room near by the beach near the PADI DIVING and that was great because we only went out and a few steps to the beach and very close to the all day buffet they have, but from the main restaurant and the lobby like 1/2 mile away, but if you are for vacations you have the time to walk, the room # number we had I think was 5232 or 5226 and i loved it. because was near by the beach and very close to the pool.THE BEACH: at the iberostar bavaro beach resort it is very nice because there were many Palapas available all the day long were we relaxed , but if you go to the other two hotels , iberostar dominicana and iberostar punta cana, the beach is very crowded because the beach is a lot smaller than the iberostar bavaro, that has like1.5 miles of beautiful white soft sanded beach, with two volleyball courts and one soccer court. so you have many places to relax and get the sun. the weather in January is great because of all the breeze it goes by, and it rains but for five minutes and again THE SUN comes up again, and if you are traveling in January do not care about the forecasts you read on the weather channel, because it rains or showers a little bit for five minutes but then you have beautiful days. The beach is great if you want get a great tan and if you do not care about anything, as the 90 % of tourists are European the go TOPLESS ON THE BEACH AND THERE WERE THONGS, that's one thing I like because the Europeans are used to it, I wore a thong or g string every day and went topless on the beach without caring what people say, I am in my mid 20's and it is the time to do it, and enjoyed wearing my skimpiest bikinis out there. i was not the only one wearing a thong or g string but u will see more topless women than women in thong but however you will see lots of thongs; every age and every shape THE POOL: it has a very big pool and it has a little one for the kids. The only thing maybe because of the season (JANUARY) it was very cold. There are lots of chairs for every one in January.ENTERTAINMENT: They have lots of activities to do all day long, playing water polo, and basketball in the pool; and many different activities, like bingo, dancing lessons, ping pong near by the pool. On the beach they have a volleyball court and a soccer court. and before i forget about it they have like a club for little kids were they do many things like painting, etc.At night they have a show every day and they are not the best one but you can enjoy them and have a great time, you will laugh and it is nearby the lobby bar were you can have drinks there.THE FOOD: The food is ok not great and it is average, you will find something very good and some things not but it is no big problem. The restaurants were you have to make reservations some are ok and some are very good. Do not forget to bring long pants because it is mandatory for men to use long pants there, or u will not be able to get in.THE STAFF: The staff is great the Dominican people are very warm and they are very nice people ant they will try to feel your best. they work there not for the salary they get because the salary is $130 us dlls a month and the thing is that they work and live because of the tips we give them, so PLEASE TIP THEM THEY WILL APPRECIATE it and they will be very glad to serve you, you don t have even to give them big tips, bring lots of one dollar bills. They are very poor and some of them will work from 9 am till 2 or 3 o鈥檆lock in the morning.THE GUESTS AT THE HOTEL: The most part are EUROPEANS I will say 90% and they do behave very well not as many reviews I read , telling they were rude, not true. One thing to say the people that stay at the iberostar bavaro are an upscale in comparison to the other two hotels, iberostar dominicana and iberostar punta cana. The only thing I have to complain is about some teenagers from Canada, Quebec they were noisy, drunk every day doing and behaving like animals! Also there were some AMERICANS they were screaming all day and drinking all day in the pool.The Europeans behave better! And it is sad to say this because I am an American too.

<Content>Bad food and drink...and lots of cream...spoiled a great trip The best thing about Iberostar are its incredibly dedicated and friendly employees. Next, the subtropical plantings and multitude of peacocks make for a lush, humid and quite colourful setting. A great deal of care involves maintainance of the physical plant, and it is flawless.While there are activities such as snorkling, tennis, shopping, and group exercise by the immense pool, the main components of a tirp to Bavaro are Sun, Sea, Relaxation, swimming and eating, which may be done ad nauseum practically 24 hours a day. Drinks, including alcohol, are free, which is nice for hydration, and suprisingly, I didn't see anyone passed out around the bar.American-style food is almost non-existant; every dish is tempered by creams, jellies and what my daughter refers to as wilted cheese. Many items are pickled inexplicably, and may have been recovered from a nearby shipwreck. :)....If you simply want to relax in a free-form atmosphere, this is a great place. However, we spent the first 2 plus hours searching for a room that didn't smell of mold. Accomodations are on par with an American budget hotel that needs renovation and an air purification system. The better sleep arrangements would be in pods near the pool, which leads to a commodious beach. A short walk connects everything in the Bavaro complex.Note: Speaking Spanish will help you communicate with employees and in understanding television programs. NO clocks, radios, or turndown service is available as far as I know. Its an all-inclusive. We traveled via American Air to Miami....then a 4hr layover before a four-hour flight to the Dominican republic. At the airport, expect antiquated (non-hip-hop) native music, and many employees looking for your euro or USD. Be careful as you would in any airport. This is a charming one, with thached roofs. Also, the trip from the airport to the beach is a lesson in harsh reality, and the good life of the beach is in harsh, direct contrast with the status of the local villages.

<Content>Good hotel; when not so many guests are from America and Kanada The hotel is very good, a marvelous plant, attentive personnel and very good meal.Which disturbs were the American and Canadian guests with its primitive behaviour, the missing respect in this hotel and to the personnel and to the meal even to.Besides the Americans and Kanadier were always very loud; often drunk and very unpleasently to other guests.In addition, there were also exceptions there.This hotel earned better guests and would be many more beautiful without these guests from the USA and Canada(as it was in former times much better).

<Content>Nothing you can put into words will reach 50% of the real thing. March 27th. to April 3rd. Spanish 2 kids, 6 and 2 yrs. old. Myself spends 80 nights per year away from home on business trips .... I know well what is a Hotel .... travel 100 flights per year so I know well different concepts of restaurant and accommodation.We come from the country amongst the top 3 touristic industries in the world...Spain. Iberostar Bavaro is the best description of SERVICE ... Service without exception, without artificial meaning, without sacrifice, without compromise. Iberostar Bavaro is SERVICE with its full meaning.No moschitos, no problem with food, no problem with personnel....no problem AT ALL. And these guys they just make it simple.If I use one single example, I would spoil the rest of my stay. Just go and see by yourself!Pere.-

<Content>Our 1st trip and we plan to go back! The iberostar bravaro in punta cana was wonderful.The review ahead of mine - (from Pattyann63 from NJ )wrote a great review --one that I can only reiterate!! It was a great vacation and we already miss the great staff and entertainers - Lewinske, Wilson, etc. The food was great, the hotel immaculate and the excursion snorkeling was magnificent. The tour guide even made us creme de cocoa from scratch on board. If you go, dont miss this one. Apple tours recommends it - and it was fabulous.We will definitely be going back to this hotel. The only recommendation I can give is -- BRING ALOT of sunscreen.We paid $27 for a med size bottle of No-AD sunscreen at the Hotel supermarket.I realized mid week that the stores between the Dominicana and the Bravaro will bartar with you-- even for sunscreen so shop there if necessary. The lens of my reading glasses popped out while we were there and one of the store clerks fixed it- everyone who worked there couldnt be nicer.Our kids 17, 15,and 14 had a blast. They took part in the nightly entertainment and we all have memories that will last a lifetime.

<Author>JBPittbburgh
<Content>Wonderful time, wonderful staff! Just returned from a week (Mar 24 鈥?31) with my 13 year old son. Thank you to all of the TA posts, as it greatly helped when making our selection. We booked through Apple and the Apple reps at the Bavaro (Carlos and Petra) were wonderful, friendly, well informed and speak fluent English. The resort is very large, If you have difficulty walking this may not be your best choice, If you have small children definitely bring a stroller. Everyone overpacks - take it from me - you will not use half of what you pack, Most people are in bathing suit all day long. Men only need long pants for the specialty restaurants.Rooms: Our room was adequate but please note: The couches are hard, hard, hard. I would never consider having a child use one as a bed. We had two double beds and that was fine. These are regular double size beds, not queens. I did pack extra wire hangers after having read there were not enough, which is correct. Our fridge was restocked daily with water, beer and coke products. There is a safe and iron and ironing board in each room. We never saw a clock anywhere. If you like to sleep late, request a room away from the peacocks, before you arrive. There are about a dozen and they do hop up on first floor balconies and they are very loud. We had a late flight out and were able to get a late checkout but this was after the desk checked to see if our room was booked for the next day and what flight time the new arrival was on.Staff: The staff are very kind. All of the reception staff are fluent in English and Hector (reception/checkout) is a delight. They all appreciate whatever tips you choose to leave. We learned that the average Dominican earns $200 US per month (This includes the hotel staff.) They typically work 12 hour days if they live on site, and 8 hours if they commute. They also work 12 days on and 3 days off 鈥?so again, tips are very much appreciated. Money: Do take lots of ones and small bills and whatever cash/travelers checks you will need. Note: Credit card fraud is rampant in the DR. There is a bank at the resort (at the Punta Cana hotel.) You can get a cash advance on your CCard and receive US dollars. At the ATM 鈥?you will get pesos. Right now the peso is running about 32 pesos to the dollar. However 鈥?the exchange rate is note the same once you get back to the US. The DR people love US dollars as it is much more stable that the peso. We were advised to never give a DR child money as that will encourage them to beg and not go to school.Excursions: We did four of them. The Mariniarium was a waste of time and money. It is much more about the 鈥減arty鈥?than the snorkeling experience. The Bavaro Runners all day tour was excellent and very informative. The speed boat snorkeling tour was great, and you get to drive your own speed boat. The guides stay with you as you explore the reef and even though we were far from shore the water was only 4 feet to 15 feet deep. The ATV quad excursion was the best of all. You get to ride quads for 3 to 3 陆 hours, they will film you and you can buy a DVD of your experience for 30 dollars. If we had booked this first instead of last we would have done it again.Food: Is plentiful. The buffets have a wide variety. The pool breakfast buffet is described as a continental breakfast but it is not, They also have eggs, omelets, pancakes, sausage and so much more 鈥?it just is not quite as elaborate as the main buffet. It is correct that you should make your restaurant reservations the day you get in. If you wait, you will be stuck with a 9:00 dinner reservation, Note: The restaurants will not seat you any earlier that your reservation time even if there are open tables. We dined at the Mediterranean, Steakhouse and Japanese restaurants 鈥?all were very good. Children are not permitted in the 鈥淕ourmet鈥?restaurant.Liquor: The Bahama Mamas and Banana Mamas are great with or without rum. It is no wonder the DR people are so pleasant 鈥?they drink rum all day long. At the Rock Star caf茅, there are 2 pool tables, a foosball table and an air hockey table. We were there each night as my son did not care for the shows. The bar there has top shelf 鈥?Tangueray, Bombay, Stoly, Smirnoff, Johnny Walker etc. Most of the other bars have a Normany brand of liquor.Pool/Beach: The beach is devine. We never had trouble obtaining a palapa no matter what time we went to the beach. The beach is patrolled by security, as is the entire hotel complex and I always felt very safe. There is lots going on at the pool: Beach and pool volleyball, bingo, Spanish lessons, dance lessons, scuba lessons 鈥?the staff is not intrusive, so just do what feels right.Hope this helps 鈥?if you have questions contact me and I will be happy to answer your questions.

<Content>our second time  Just got back last night and had to write this review.Our family of 6, (3 adults 3 teenagers) traveled March 29th-April 4th 2007. This was our 2nd time at Iberostar Bavero and it WON'T be our last!!! I can't rave enough about it! What I do have to say to all the people complaining about musty smells, foreign foods, and getting up early to get a prime spot in the sun......STAY IN AMERICA!!! Why are people surprised that in a warm, humid climate to experience musty smells? Why are they taken back by some foreign dishes being offered, wasn't the pancakes, french toast, waffles, and omellettes enough to satisfy them at breakfast? French fries, hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza and roasted chicken were always available at the lunch  dinner buffets! I've eaten in the best restaurants in the world and their gourmet restaurants are not bad, but you don't go to an all-inclusive for the food! Drinking water in ANY foreign country is just plain crazy, some precautions should always be taken when traveling abroard...ie. drinking and brushing teeth w/bottled water, peeling fruit, no raw veggies or salad and stay hydrated! The rooms are well kept  spacious, the grounds are gorgious  immaculate, the beach  ocean are breathtaking! Every employee works beyond hard to please, but the star friends make your day extra fun. Lewinske, Henry, Oscar and all their associates go out of their way to make everyone feel special and have a memorable vacation. Bartenders Danielo, Wildon and their associates are quick with a cold drink and ready smile! Our daughters' 18th birthday was celebrated during our stay, and all of our new found friends made her day extra special. Samuel, made a special cake for her, the band sang to her and they all took a turn salsa dancing with her near the pool bbq!  There are enough activities to keep everyone happy and busy. A small casino keeps some busy, and is questionable about it's ethics(what do you expect without a casino commission?). The disco is lots of fun after 11. A teenagers paradise! But adults have fun too! I read the monthly forcast religiously prior to our trip, it said rain EVERYDAY,  we didn't get a drop during the day, only once at night...so don't pay attention to that! Lots of touristy stuff at the beach huts, haggle for a good price, hair braids 1/2 the $ then the hotel. I've NEVER been to a hotel or cruise where we DIDNT have to get up early for our favorite spot in the sun, so I don't know where these people have been(The early bird catches the worm!) But there is plenty of room both at the pool  beach. The buffet area is huge, the lines minimal, and plenty to choose from. The gourmet rest. must be booked at arrival, 16 and older males MUST wear long pants in enclosed restaurants. Peacocks are everywhere, and VERY vocal! BUT no traces of them anywhere, flamingos, swans etc are nice near the buffet. The complex is huge, alot of walking on slippery, uneven pavers(ladies, wear comfortable, flat or wedgey heels) You can catcha golf cart for long treks. Our rooms were 1111, 1121  1122, they were great, very central convienient. Champagne was mucho frio at the lobby bar. And a few dollars go a long way, like having Stoli ready for you at the pool bar. These people work extremely long hours, very hard , at least 14 hours, 12 days on, 3 off. for very little money! A tip here and there is very appreciated BUT NOT expected!  So go to this wonderful resort and enjoy a memorable vacation, you won't be dissappointed, and believe me I'm not easily satisfyed(my nickname is High maintenance!) We're already planning a return trip!! April has a nice breeze, July is extremely hot, But either season ....I'll be back!!!!! Say Hi to Lewinske from Ali's and Johnny Bravos family....we miss them already!!!!!!!! Patty, Joe, Adrienne, Ali, Joey  Brendan from New Jersey

<Content>Best time ever!!! My husband and I stayed at Iberostar Bavaro from March 10-17, 2007 to celebrate our 10 yr. anniversary and had a wonderful time!! I'll break down our experience so it is easier to follow.Arrival: We booked through Apple Vacations and this is the way to go. Everything runs smoothly from start to finish. Although, do hold onto your $10 tourist card that they give you. Everyone says that you get it at one place and hand it in at the next. This is not true. The next window she stamps your passport, but you go about 30 steps and then hand your tourist card to another gentleman. There was some confusion with my husband's card, but all worked out okay. Ride to the hotel was about 30 minutes.Check-in/rooms: Check in was a breeze. We faxed and e-mailed a room request prior to our trip and slipped Gilberto a $20 and we received a wonderful room just one row back from the beach. Definitely request a renovated room, they are worth it! We couldn't get a king size bed that close to the beach, but they pushed two doubles together and it was fine. We had no problems with our room and be sure to tip the maid and bring some small gifts for her. She works hard and deserves it.Beach: What else can I say except outstanding! We spent almost everyday at the beach, not bothering with the pool. Chairs are always available, but you must get up very early for a cabana. They say no reserving of chairs/huts, but everyone does and no one bothers your stuff when you leave it unattended. Beach is immaculant and they are always cleaning it. Great beach bar! Tell Leonardo Frank says Hola!! Take your own insulated mug to keep drinks longer and they have no problem filling them up at the bars. No worries about them rinsing out with tap water. This is an optional topless beach and many do go topless, but no one seems to care. Very relaxing. Definitely go to the beach market and haggle! Never pay more than 25% of initial asking price. No more than $3/cigar. You'll get great deals on great cigars! The only down side to the beach is the chairs. They do not lay flat. This started to bother our backs when we would lay on our stomach. Not sure why these chairs are like this when the ones at the pool go flat, but this is something I wish they would change.Food: The LaCouples (gourmet) restaurant is outstanding!!!! We had the lobster salad and dark and white choc dessert. I had the grouper and my husband the shrimp and it was all excellent. Great service too. We also ate at the steakhouse and Cajun. Steakhouse is way overrated. Service was slow and the meat was undercooked. We asked for medium well and it was all but raw! Cajun was good, with a buffet for appetizers and dessert. Regular buffet is good with plenty to choose from. Wednesday is lobster (king prawn) night so don't miss it. We ate lunch at the beach bar or pool buffet for lunch. Great dogs and fries at the beach bar and lots of good stuff at the pool buffet. You can go to this buffet in swim suits, no shirts for guys and barefoot. Ice cream hut is great!!Excursions: Our Apple rep Carlos was great! He helped us set up our excursions and was there to answer any questions we had throughout the week. We did the Marinarium and Bavaro Runners. Marinarium we snorkled with sharks and rays then partied afterward. Lots of fun, drink and dancing:) Bavaro Runners was the best! You get to see the real Dominican. We visted a sugar cane fields, a real working Dominican home, school, beautiful cave, had a great lunch at the Bavaro ranch, rode horses and just had an all around great time. Alex our tour guide was excellent in explaining to us all aspects of the Dominican lifestyle and told us history of all the places we went. We knew ahead of time to take treats for the kids and it was definitely worth it. To see the smiles on their faces is priceless. We took bubble gum, candy, coloring books, crayons, stickers and baseball hats. Be sure to take plenty if you are going to do this because there are so many kids! Your tour guide will tell you which kids you can give to. I also took treats for the dogs. They are so skinny and loved the milk bones. We also were on both excurions with a great group of people from Ohio. We want to give a big shout out Hey! to our new found friends that we had a blast with. Glad we were able to help Eileen celebrate her birthday:)Staff: Everyone was wondeful! From the lobby staff, to the bartenders, maid, servers, ground crew, everyone was just so happy, always smiling and willing to please. We tipped anyone who helped or served us. They work really hard and don't make much money so they do appreciate it.Departure: Carlos will give you your departure time the night before you leave. We heard rumors about airport security going through every piece of luggage and taking money, but we had none of that. It was a breeze through checking luggage, and because of this, we had a long wait in the airport. No AC so dress appropriately. Return flight to US was fine, but once in Atlanta, GA the nightmare began! I won't get into it, but I will say that Delta really needs to get their stuff together.Overall: We had a wondeful time! The Dominican people are always smiling and more than happy to help you. The resort is first class and I would stay there again without hesitation. Thanks to everyone who posted on TA. It helped us make the decision to pick this hotel and I'm really glad we did.

<Content>Beautiful We have just returned from a week at the Iberostar Bavero Punta Cana, and while this is a spectacular resort, I would rate it a 4 star. I have travelled extensively, and I find that service is what makes it for me. The grounds were terriffic, the pool was beautiful, entertainment was a great effort and very funny most nights.Food was good, although I think that one room for the buffet was rather small especially when you had so many trying to eat at once.The housekeeping staff were friendly and came in the A.M. only. I enjoy it when someone comes back in the evening and straightens up the room again, turns down the bed and so on. This is 5 star! We had to constantly ask for water, and on the 6th day they dropped a case of 24 bottles at our door!Overall, I did enjoy this resort a lot, there just needs to be a little bit more effort made.

<Content>Great family trip to Bavaro We just returned from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro (March 25-April 1) and had a great time. My husband and I traveled with our 13 and 4 year old sons. We are frequest travelers to all-inclusive resorts and have stayed at Iberostar Del Mar, Iberostar Maya, Riu Palace Cabo, Beaches Turks and Caicos, and Club Med Ixtapa. The Iberostar Bavaro did not disappoint us - it is very relaxing and easy to visit. We had a room close to the pool which was great. The beach is beautiful and right behind the pool which made it so easy to spend the day going to both. The ocean was very rough while we were there so we didn't snorkle. But we did play in the waves and really enjoyed the water. The sand is incredibly soft and you could walk a long way along the beach which we really liked. The restaurants and theatre were a very short walk away which was also helpful. We all loved the food. The variety was tremendous at the buffet at every meal. Often the buffet at dinner can be a dissappointment, but this resort had wonderful freshly prepared food. We ate everything and none of us got sick.My 4 year old liked the kids club. The women who worked the kids club, Keila and Belle, were wonderful!! My son would spend at least a couple hours a day at the kids club activities. My 13 year old loved the water basketball, water polo, and air gun touraments. He met many kids to play with and had a great time. We had been concerned about the beach being top-less since we were taking our teen son - but it really wasn't a big issue while we were there. There were only a few top-less sunbathers at the beach. While we had a great time, this resort not as luxurious as the Iberostar Maya in the Mexico. The rooms are smaller - especially the bathrooms and dressing areas. We had a room with the 2 beds. I was hoping that they really were not as small as people claimed - but they really were only slightly bigger than a single bed. They made the day beds in the sitting room up for the kids to sleep on. For my younger son it was no problem but for my 13 year old who is 5'4 tall the day bed was really small - he survived the week but if we go back in the future we will need a different option for him. The bathroom was ok with separate tub and shower - but it was quite small. The bathroom itself had a frosted glass door so it wasn't totally private. By contrast our room at the Iberostar Maya had two sinks and large glass shower and separate jacuzzi tub plus a large dressing area with two closets - it was more than twice the size of the Bavaro bath area. We did enjoy the porch we had at Bavaro. We had two days of downpouring rain (at least 5 hours each day) so we spent a lot of time on our porch! It was also great for drying suits. We were told by our Apple rep that it rains about 2 days a month and that they hadn't had rain in 4 weeks. It really made up for it while we were there. Fortunately, by the third day all the rain came at night. We tried three days in a row to do the power boat excursion and it was cancelled every time because the water was too rough.The pool is also not as large as the Iberostar Del Mar or Maya. It is a more natural setting with more trees on the islands of the pools - compared to the pillared pools in Mexico. But the pool is really user friendly. It was zero entry (walk-in) around about half the pool and our little guy could touch the bottom for a long way out and there were many areas he could jump in and swim - it was great for him. My older son was originally disappointed in the pool but in the end said it was great. He loved the water basketball and polo and because the pool area was smaller he always knew when the pool games were starting. There were lots of shaded seating areas around the pool so we were all happy.This resort is also more casual than the other resorts we have stayed at (except Club Med). For lunch at the beach buffet, only bathing suits were required, cover-ups, t-shirts, shoes were totally optional. The breakfast/dinner buffet was also casual - but beach cover-ups and shoes were required. The only place that had a real dress code was the ala carte restaurants and the men and teen boys were required to wear long pants. I don't know the exact numbers - but Bavaro seemed much maller than Del Mar and Maya. We really enjoyed being closer to the pool. beach, theatre and restaurants. None of the facilities seemed to be very crowded. It made it a very easy and relaxing stay for us all.

<Content>Unforgettable I'll try to keep this short......Security: Awesome. They are alway there, but not in your face way. We were eight lucky ladies living life...and even our late..late..late night walks on the beach they were present.Money: Bring a lot of ones ($50..was not enough) They are hard working and even though this is all inclusive, we felt they went out of their way to keep up happy. We left some small gifts for our housekeeper (perfume, soaps, jewerly) and a tip...she was very happy and went out of her way to keep us in order.Casino: Us ladies do like to play cards...so we hit the casino for some slots and blackjack. It's small...but we had fun. If you are looking for vegas dealers...or sometimes even a small..you are not going to find it here. We just selected the tables where everyone was having fun and meet some fun people....unforgettable.Excursions: We all went on the Outback Safari and booked it with TNT (Poppy). It was great to see how they really live....it was very humbling. I brought along some crayons, paper, Winnie-the-pooh bandaids lollipops..ect and left them at the school (which was one of the stops) So if you think you want to do this and you have extra room...load up...it was great to see the smiles and know that you helped. Also, you should know, that giving gifts to the children on the streets is illegal. They don't want the children to become beggars and if they are getting gifts on the street, they won't go to school.Food: The gourmet restaurant was TOP. Book early. We didn't have a Bad meal, but you need to remember that our American stomaches can't handle the food in the same way...bring Pepto tabs or Amodium AD...just in case...half of us had to use them. We were not really sick...just some mild problems...didn't interfere with us having a good time.Okay...that's it from usPamela

<Content>The Good, the bad, and the ugly Let's start from the beginning:FLIGHT: AA wonderful. Nonstop, even lunch. Getting through the airport took about 30 minutes and then I had a wonderful driver from VIP take me to the hotel. Speedy!!CHECK-IN: Very fast and efficient. They gave me my requested room and explained the resort in detail.ROOM: Nice and clean. Nothing to fantastic but along the lines of a Marriott. The housekeeper kept the fridge stocked with beverages and cleaned extremely well. I did leave her a generous tip daily.BEACH: The very reason I came here. Blue water and white sand. Lots of people but no problem finding a chair...in the sun.There was excellent bar service on the beach and I never so so many people raking and picking up cigarette butts in my life.The weather was about 82 degrees. I stayed four days, it rained on the day I left.TOURISTS: People from all over. I never saw so many kids at a resort in my life. However, they were well behaved.FOOD: Your basic all inclusive. However, they had one tiny room for the buffet and all 500 people needed to fit in it. I found myself waiting on line for OJ for almost ten minutes. Due nto the long lines, I really didn't eat much. Room service was pretty good and it arrived very quickly.SERVICE: Outrageous. This is the best service I have ever experienced in an all inclusive and several other hotels. People were always happy to please you.FACILITIES: Clean. The pool was nothing special. They had a pool bar that was rarely crowded Once again, spotless.ENTERTAINMENT: I stay away from this on vacations. I travelled alone and all I wanted was piece and quiet. I did hear from others that it was good and there seemed to be many activities to chose from.THE BAD: My shower was broked. ONLY HOT water. I called and they said they would send someone right away. The housekeeper told me they came. I feel asleep and didn't take a shower until the next mornng. About 1 hour before my shuttle was to arrive. I went into the shower and heard loud banging and yelling at the door I wrapped the towel arould me and slowly opened thee door to see the two plumbers. I asked for them to come back. Instead the went into the bathroom and ran all the faucets. Here I am in just a towel. They would not leave. They saif they fixed it and to now feel the water. It was steaming hot. They would not leave and they told me to get the soap in my hair and shower somewhere else. I immediately called the front desk. She told the men to come back so I went back into my shower, while the tools lay on the floor. Five minutes later they begin to pound on the door again. I had finished my shower, had the towel around my waist and asked, well demanded them to leave. They wouldn't. Once again I phoned the front desk in tears. I am a woman travelling alone. She told me to have them come in and she would tell them to leave.They did. However, the humality I felt....It was although I am ashamed. The front dest manager cam eo me and sat down. She apologized over and over again. However, there's not iscuse for this behavior. So waht started out as a great vacation, end up to be a disaster. FINAL THOUGHTS: What can I say. It's hard to recommend this hotel and really unfortuanately. I guess my advice...don't open the door to anyone!!

<Content>Loved the Bavaro, loved the people My wife and I and our two sons, 12 and 8 just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro, our stay was from March 12 to 19. This is our 2nd Iberostar resort, last year staying at the Paraiso Maya in the Mayan Riviera, Mexico. Needless to say, our experience of last year's vacation was certainly positive enough to to give the chain the nod for this year. And again, we were not disappointed. I won't bore you all with a repeat of all of the positive reviews you've read here. I will only say they are all valid and accurate...the staff, the grounds, the beach, the weather, the food/restaurants...wonderful. The Dominicans are great people, hard working and well trained, yes, some struggle with the English language, but their English is alot better than my Spanish will ever be. An example of how they care about their guests: my wife won an air rifle tournanment and therefore was to be presented a certificate that evening on stage. We went that night for the silly presentation and her name wasn't called. Oh well, hundreds of vacationers, things happen, no biggy. The next morning, the upset staff member ran up to my wife with her certificate, a Star Friends t-shirt, and profuse and endless apologies. We had to comfort him. And they are all like that. We were amazed at how many remembered our names, even after only a day or two.We also experienced a varied, but very polite, respectful, friendly group of fellow guests from all over the world...retirees, young families, older families, couples, etc.My sons, my wife, and I, all highly recommend this resort.

<Content>Sorry we had to leave ! The Iberostar Bavaro is exactly what we were looking for a beautiful and relaxing vacation. This resort offered both relaxation and peace as well as the opportunity to party into the morning if you wanted. We normally handle all of our own vacation plans but decided to go through Apple Vacations this time. I can not thank our Apple representatives enough, especially Carlos and Petra! Everywhere we went we had an Apple rep ready to assist us. We went with another couple and none of us had any problems at the Airport upon arrival or departure. Our check in and check out was fast and quick, our tours and dining reservations were all made easily and for the times we wanted. The rooms were very clean, large and very beautiful. Although, with so much to do we were not in them very long. There was so much food offered on the buffets that even the pickiest eater would have had a hard time not finding something they liked. Although, they do not offer what we Mid Westerners call top shelf alcohol (crown royal, southern comfort, kesslers etc.) we did not have a problem finding plenty of other great drinks. We spent most nights trying different drinks and had a blast doing it. I highly recommend the Coco Loco (be warned though coconut is a natural laxative!). If you are not an alcohol drinker the only soft drinks offered are Coke products(no Pepsi products). For those that enjoy a beer the only kind available is El Presidente or Becks N/A. If you are looking for an American beer there is none to be found.The people were all very friendly and ready to assist us with any questions or needs we had. The only thing we were a little disappointed with was that the pool was closed at night. It would have been great to be able to use the pool at night as well as during the day. The shows every night in the main lobby bar are quite entertaining especially when they include the audience in the shows. In previous reviews we read the resort is very well maintained and beautiful, these reviews were correct. The grounds and buildings were all clean and beautiful. Make sure you bring plenty of one dollar bills for tips even though you don't have to tip as it is all inclusive. A little tip here and there went a long way. We never had to wait for a waitress or bartender and by the second day most of them new what drink we wanted without us telling them.We had an Awesome time and the four of us are already planning our return trip there only this time we are staying much longer. The hardest part of this vacation was returning to Green Bay to 30 degrees and rain/sleet.

<Content>Best Vacation Ive ever had I have traveled the world, i have seen many things. It is important to say that this truly was the best experience i have ever had. iberostar bavaro punta cana was the most memorable vacation I have ever been on. There is so much to do, and the staff was icredible. They welcome you with such a warm greeting and you truly feel like you are at home. The staff at Disney World at first are kind to you, and then slack off as if they dont want to be there. At Iberostar Bavaro it is their home. They are so kind, and not to mention very talented. Some of the best dancers i have ever seen are right there at that fantastic resort. I have never been to a beach party at one in the morning, or scuba dived in a pool until this trip. Every thing was incredible. I was a fan of the dancing that took place wherever you walked. I truly appreciated the dedicated men and women who took the extra minutes to keep up the resort grounds ultimately making it the nicest and cleanest. I strongly recommend this resort. It is child friendly, and suitable for all ages with so much to do if you want to be active, or a beach if you just want to relax and enjoy the famous Coco Loco. Oh yea, and dont forget about the all inclusive plan that comes with the hotel, i guess i forgot to mention that little detail. This makes the resort 100 times better. It is a relief to not carry a cell phone around, or money, and not know the time. It is without a doubt the best vacation to take your family, or a loved one on. Words cant even explain my stay at the Iberostar Bavaro.

<Content>Absolutely amazing time!! If there's a negative, it's that I had to come home! My friends and I just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro, and we had an AMAZING time! Overall, we concluded that our stay was definitely a bargain, considering how much it costs for all-inclusives in other Caribbean locations like Aruba, Jamaica, etc. We would have to spend hundreds of dollars more for the same level of service elsewhere. The D.R. is becoming more popular, so I'm expecting that prices will increase once people realize how great it is!Let me start by saying that the grounds of this resort are gorgeous! Not my words nor even photos can not do it justice. It's perfect! Very green, very lush, and there are peacocks everywhere... and I mean everywhere! CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN.... I think it's amazing how clean they even keep the bathrooms by the pool and in the lobby! There are not many resorts in the US that keep their facilities as clean as the Iberostar.As for the staff, they are some of the friendliest and most accomodating I've experienced in my travels. If you try to speak Spanish, they love you even more. They are always smiling, particularly the male staff. The bartenders at the pool bar are great... say hola to Cecilio and Freimy for me! They love to get you to try their shots. (They may even do one with you! But on the down low)The food is impressive. Sometimes you hear about how the food quality is not that great at all-inclusives, but I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, when you stay at a resort for 5+ days, the food at the buffet will get repetitive. But it's a good quality, and it has EVERYTHING. Prepare to indulge... like cheros for breakfast! I was a bit disappointed in the fresh fruit. I did not think it was outstanding, just fair. For specialty restaurants try the Gourmet (amazing Lobster salad and beef tenderloin) and the Japanese (the Tepankayi was awesome, sushi was just ok). We wanted to try the Mexican but could not get a reservation. I'd suggest making all of your reservations for your trip as soon as you check in. The times fill up quickly, particularly at the better restaurants.My friends and I were there for a wedding, and it could not have been more perfect. The weather is beautiful, 85-90 everyday with a strong ocean wind that keeps you cool. We were never sweating terribly. You can always count on the sun in the D.R. If you wake up and don't see it, don't worry. The haze fades... FAST!Lastly, the rooms were also very nice, not luxurious but adequate. They were on the big size since all rooms are suites; we fit 3 people in our room comfortably. Each suite has a nice balcony with a couch and table and a large bathroom. (Be advised some of the rooms do not have updated bathrooms) Our room had a separate tub and glass enclosed shower, more recently renovated. I would suggest asking for one of these rooms. Also, ask to be closer to the main path if possible. Just a suggestion! All the rooms are nice enough.If you're debating staying here, do not hesitate. It's fantastico!! My friends and I would go back in a heartbeat!! I think I'm slipping back into vacation mode just thinking about it....

<Content>Wonderful week We just returned from a beautiful week at a gorgeous resort. The Bavaro was well worth it. We have stayed at other Iberostar resorts and the quality of care we received, the attention to detail and the sheer beauty of the place can not be outdone. The food was delicious, room was very comfortable and even the peacock alarm clocks were amusing. Lunch and dinner at the buffet took on a whole new feel when we sat by the railing of the pond where the flamingos live. They don't beg, just stand within feet of your table and stare until you give in with a crumb of bread. And they take it sooooo politely. The beach is without a doubt the best in the Caribbean. It feels like talc. Even my husband who is the biggest tenderfoot in the East, walked in it without sandals - wonderful. A short stroll up the beach are about a dozen huts selling locally made crafts and such. They'll braid your hair, give you a massage, serve you a beer and even let you pet their dogs. Only the dog petting is free. My husband and I traveled with our daughter and her husband who are in their late 30's. They enjoyed the Hard Rock Cafe one evening at the Dominicanna next door. We lost $10 in the Casino within minutes. There are a lot more shops and goings on over there and its just a short walk to it. I liked the Bavaro better because the rooms are all in bungalows, whereas the Dominicanna and Punta Cana are in single buildings - the Bavaro is so much quieter.There was entertainment around the pool every afternoon, a beach party on Thursday afternoon where they served lobster piella. Mmmm good. While we were there they installed a soft icecream machine in addition to the icecream hut by the pool - nice touch. We didn't have a single thing to complain about other than not being able to stay more than 7 days - gotta go home some time.

<Content>Loved the Iberostar Bavaro!!!! My fiance and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro the week of March 4th-10th. First and foremost, I would like to comment on the security...they had security guards EVERYWHERE, so I always felt comfortable walking places by myself, even at night time. The room was always very clean. The beds were not very comfortable, but I did not mind. The rooms smelled a little musty from the humidity, but after a while I got used to the smell. My only complaint was that my clothes smelled very musty when I got home and it was very hard to wash out. If you are staying at the Bavaro, I would recommend calling ahead and trying to request a room close to the beach. Our room was in the last row and it always took us 5 minutes just to get anywhere. The Iberostars Dominicana and Punta Cana were both only walks away, and they were always immaculately clean as well. The rooms were always beautifully cleaned, and the staff was very friendly. They were always excited to get $1 tips, because american dollars are worth a lot to them. I brought $50 in one dollar bills and that was all I spent the entire week for Tips. The beaches were gorgeous and always clean. We never had problems getting the Palapas or chairs near the pool. The only recommendation I would make is to try to put your towels on the beach around 7 or 7:30 AM, because they do start to get full around 8AM. Everyone reserves them, even though they are not supposed to.Snorkeling is free and I would recommend it to everyone. If you swim near the reef/rocks, you see a lot of gorgeous exotic fish. It was a really fun experience! We also rode the Banana boats, which were really fun. Parasailing was fun and really inexpensive.We went to the Steakhouse one night and it was very good! The service was outstanding. We got in and out in 30 minutes, but never once felt rushed. I would recommend making your dinner reservations the same day you check in. If you try to make them in the middle of the week, everything will already be reserved and you will not be able to eat anywhere except for the buffet. The buffet was surprisingly excellent. We ate breakfast there every morning,and they had a huge array of foods to choose from so no one ever went hungry. Room service was also very good. Drinks were excellent, but they did not have the American liquors (jack daniels, captain morgain,etc) so I was slightly dissapointed. But the Brugal Rum that they served was not very bad.. We went to the dinner buffet 4 out of 5 nights and were always very pleased. Lunch is always very fun. They set up a nice outdoor buffet by the pool and always have different things to choose from. I was never hungry!!I would highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro to anyone who is looking for a relaxing beach vacation with all your cares taken care of. I will definately be returning in the future.

<Content>Best resort in puna cana Just came back from iberostar on march 10th. went with my husband and 2 daughters aged 21 and 25 as well as 3 year old grandson. This is our 7th time in dominicon and loved this resort the most. I emailed 1 week before and received great rooms. We had rooms # 1181 and #1182 close to everything.The grounds are beautiful, best beach weve been to. Food was good. We ate at the pool buffet everyday for lunch, they grilled meat in front of you. Pork chops, chicken, burgers, plus hot buffet and salad bar. we ate at the steakhouse almost every night, it was fantastic. Francisco the manager let us in whenever we wanted after slipping him $10.00. japanese was ok. A show you must see is the broadway night, done very professional, costumes great, singing outstanding. Star team does a great job entertaining in both the day and night. Huck does a wonderful job. I was up every morning at 6:30 am only because I'm an early riser on holidays. You have to if you want a hut by the pool or beach they are all taken by 8:00 am.Very clean, staff great, we are going back in november. You wont be dissappointed.My husband is very picky eater and he never went hungry. The only downfall to puna cana is there airport, they have there own rules and are rude and arrogant. There scales are different from ours so they charge overweight even though your not. They said we were 10 pound over on our 5 pieces and charged 90.00 us. my nephew and girlfriend went the week before us and they made them put there carry ons on the weigh scale because there luggage was under and they charged them 90.00 us. you also have to pay 20.00 us dominicon tax upon leaving. hold onto your bags the porters will grab them and not give them back untill he gets tipped. Have a great time.

<Content>Couldn't have asked for more!!!! THANK YOU TRIP ADVISOR!We spent days reading and re reading reviews. We decided on this hotel due to the raves of other travelers. It was all that! We spent the first week of March there. Took Apple and as others saidIberostar does it right and so did Apple. Updated room, location, food, entertainment, management..........everyone wanted to please. We took the Trip Advisor's suggestions and sent an email in advance requesting a specific type room. Got it! When we got there we requested and received additional ala carte meals. Got them! Food was everywhere and good. If you didn't like one dish go back/or ask and get a dozen others. Drinks were fine and their champagne was chilled and very decent quality. The weather, the ocean, the pools, the landscape...........stunning, and especially the wildlife (exotic birds) everywhere! There was always plenty to do and see. We couldn't even imagine the hours and manpower it took to keep this hotel sparkling and it was. Very clean! They were constantly doing repairs, cleaning and maintenance. It seemed like - tell them - and they fixed it. The air went out for a few hours and saw men digging in the dark - sure enough the air was fixed shortly after. We let them know an ice machine was out - one day only. Our ironing board broke, had a new one w/in hours................ we think they sent someone to the store........and who really wanted to iron anyway. The few things that were not perfect were minor. Instead of king bed, we pushed 2 full size beds together. The toughest part of the trip was a very bad wait at the airport to get thru the USA 3000 line. The airline did a good job w/ everything but this. We were also confused (and still are) if you can take any liquids at all in your carry on - so at the last minute we threw them all into our checked baggage.The vacationers did dress well. We should have taken a few more nice outfits. There was an air of class w/ out attitude. We are from the Chicago suburbs and in our 50's-it had an bit of an adult feel and that was great for us. We felt it was good for a number of age groups, but liked the fact that we were not tripping over a lot of children. I read on this site - not to wait for this resort to go on sale...and we didn't. It IS worth every penny and a great value! We did feel this was by far the finest of the 3 hotels - and loved spending time checking out the others. The shops in the complex even had some great values. (Don't forget your cameras- $25 for a disposable).Awesome trip! GO GO GO!We now read these reviews (w/ a grain of salt) and make our decisionsw/ the travelers help. We will cont. to make future plans this way - so again Thanks to All for writing!!!! And thank you Apple  Iberostar Bavaro!

<Content>Just Okay... My husband, two teenage sons and our 2 year old just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana. First I will say that the grounds are immaculate the landscaping is absolutely gorgeous and the people there are so very friendly and really work hard. A couple we had met there spoke with one of the girls that was working and said she works 12 days on -12 hours a day, stays at the resort and then has 3 days off. I would really like to know how much she is paid. These kids are there when you get your breakfast and at dinner- it was crazy. Tip them they need it!I was very unhappy with the room that we stayed in. We had adjoining rooms very close to the beach which was really convenient but the rooms were run down.First floor rooms are not updated. The bed was horrible. We requested a king bed and they put two doubles together. You will need a massage just because the mattress is so awful. When we arrived the toilet didn't flush, there wasn't a crib in my room as I requested, also we requested a non smoking room which it wasn't because there was an ashtray on the table--- ALOT of smokers here too. But the worst part was my son's luggage was missing after many calls to the front desk ( which I kept getting the Iberostar Dominicana's front desk?????) My kids went for a walk and found the luggage on one of the pathways!There are alot of Europeans and they like to go topless. My sons 13 and 15 felt a little(lot) awkward especially when people would ask my boys to take their topless picture!There is no top shelf liquor. They have Normandy brand liquor and it is totally weak. I could not find a drink the entire week I was there that I could actually say I liked. The pina coladas on the beach are on ice. Not frozen.  The restaurants require pants except at the Steak house. They would not serve us at the Japanese restaurant because my boys didn't have long pants on. Ridiculous considering it is 90 degrees. If you stay at the resort for seven nights you can have 3 guaranteed reservations at the Gourmet restaurants. We at at the Couples restaurant and liked it alot. The steak house was good also and then we did eventually get into the Japanese restaurant with jeans on!! In my opinion I would much rather see a man wearing a pair of khaki cargo shorts than jean pants at dinner---But that is just me.The buffet got really old. If I see another buffet I really will be ill. The bread and desserts were really good. I am glad I went , the weather was amazing and the beach and water were great but it wouldn't be a place I would go back to . Beaches Turks and Caicos is much better in my opinion.

<Content>Nice and clean My wife and I went for 5 days, nice rooms, nice area. Not a whole lot of English spoken but who cares, If I wanted to make friends I would have headed to FL, I liked not having people just like me... Anyway, drinks - yes, sometimes not the best (little watered down) , again who cares, get 3 drinks at one time - ask for just a whole glass of rum. Food good - if you don't like one place you can eat at another... you can eat dinner at 3 places if you want.... I never went hungry. What I did not like - beach very nice - Jamacia - more calm, little nicer.... Tips - again poor country a dollar here and there got you better service. I would go back again.... Vacaiton is what you make of it... Nothing wrong with this place very nice and clean... I would go back again and tell others to this is a great place.

<Content>Great trip to Iberostar Bavaro We just returned from our week at the Bavaro. That was just about right but we'll miss the beach. You can't beat the weather this time of year in Punta Cana. 80's and sunny all but 1 day this week. Here's a few items that I hope might help you decide.1) Getting there: Be sure to check the State department website for info before you go. No troubles at the airport. There was a $10 entry fee to get into the country. The porters were very aggressive. We booked with Apple vacations. They were top notch. If you don't go with a tour company, suggest you pay the extra for the bus transfer. A taxi ride didn't look very safe. Get your luggage and find your bus. The ride to the hotel was a bit scarry. Terrible blight and poverty all along the way. (Note the guy on the right with a rifle). The road was quite horrible. 30-40 minutes to the Bavaro from the airport.2) The Bavaro: Everything is CLEAN. Many workers to do this. Check in was a snap. Communication is still a problem from time to time. There aren't enough english speaking people, yet. They're getting there though. The room was a little worn but more than adequate. Buffet meals were pretty good but mostly leaning toward the European's. Book your specialty resteraunt reservations the day you get in. They fill up fast. The steak house is the best. Enjoyed the presentation at La Coupal's. The japanese resteraunt was weak. Can't trust Dominicans to serve good sushi I guess.:} Still, It wasn't horrible, just not great. Pool lunch barbeque closes at 1:30. Best lunch food at the BBQ. The rest is open later. The people were very friendly and work very hard 6am to 11plus every day for 12 days straight.3) Drinks: They claim to have Premium liquor. HA I say!!!! Yes they had tangeray, a few whisky's and stoli but that was about it. Be sure to ask for it or they'll give you the local swill. Also, the wine was like homemade stuff uncle Tony would make at 11% alcohol content. Not terrible but definately nowhere near high end. Champagne was good though. Best drinks in the place-Coco-loco ( ask for double rum), Bahama mama, and a dirty banana. No good taquilla on the island at all. BYOT.4) Beach/pool: Get up early (6:30-7) and stake your claim to an umberella. The sun is murder from 12-3 and you'll need some siesta time. General trend was beach in the morning and pool in the afternoon. It's a great walk up and down the beach and close to the local beach shops. Beware: Ladies don't go to the beach shops without your man. The merchants are very aggressive and touchy!!! 2 decent volleyball courts. Snorkel right out in front of the resort. Plenty of fish about 30 yards out.5) Excursions: We only did the Marinarium snorkel tour. It was $70 each. Had a good time and swam with some sharks and sting rays. We also road around as a party boat for awhile. Wasn't worth $70 but was adequate. Apple rep suggest we should not parasail or horseback ride. Too many accidents due to safety concerns according to him.6) Entertainment: The shows were slightly entertaining. Very corny. The disco doesn't open until 11:30. Table games at the casino didn't open until 8pm. Lost money. Watch the dealers. They make mistakes (Not the reason I lost money).7) Getting home: Bus left 4 hours prior to flight. The line was extra long getting checked in. Our tour flight actually left an hour early. Security was a joke but they did have the drug sniffing dogs. Again, porters were aggressive. Minimal food options. NOOOOO COFFEE??!!!8) Misc.: We spent about $75 in tips. $1 to $2 at a time, occasionally a $5 for great service. We tipped the maid extra for extra water. It was worth it. Bring your own singles. They're hard to come by. Get a key to the safe at check in and lock up your stuff. Hope this helps you. We had a great time and would recommend it to anyone. It's definately a nice resort destination.

<Content>great resort my family included me and my husband and a 3 year old child. All of us had a great time and would love to come back to this resort and even stay longer. our week was from march 2-march 9, 2007. the rooms were nice, clean and spacious. we arrived to the hotel at 1 pm and got a room right away which was located close to the beach and the pool and 5 minutes away from all other places in the resort.The food was very good and a lot of variety. tHERE was many choices of meet, fish, fruits and vegetables and breads.. Everything tasted really good and all of us enjoyed it. Luckuly non of us got sick with stomach virus and we did not know anyone who did.The beach was absolutely beautiful and clean. i guess this is the best time to visit islands. plenty of shades but everything was occupied by 9am and it was hard to find space.The resort overall was great and very beautiful, with a lot of flowers, birds, flamingos and greenery.we would go back again and would think about staying longer next time.

<Content>AAAAAAAA #1!! Spent March 2nd thru' 9th at this fabulous resort with my daughter and son-in-law. We spent a week here last year and a week in the Riviera Maya the year before. Loved the resort in Mexico, but the beach in Punta Cana is far better!I won't go over all the same things you read in these reviews - just wanted to add my two cents worth. I have read these reviews for the past two years and I cannot believe some of the complaints in them! Give me a break! Rarely will you have an absolutely perfect vacation,but as far as I'm concerned a week at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana comes pretty darn close!!One other quick note - Carlos is one terrific Apple rep!! He is ready, willing and able to help with anything you need and he is funny too. And he is smart too!

<Content>Relaxing Vacation I would like to add, we can be a bit of vacation snobs and was a little hesitant about going to an all-inclusive (this was our first). I must admit the Iberostar Bavaro exceeded our expectations.We found the resort to be exceptionally clean, the staff friendly and very efficient, the beaches beautiful and the food interesting, creative and although not 5 star USA, always good. We never had a problem finding something different, fresh and tasty to eat (and my husband is a very meat and potato type of eater). The gourmet restaurant was our favorite. My only complaint would be the drinks, although they offer top shelf liquor, they fail to have top shelf mixers. The drinks were very sweet and syrupy. My husband drank Presidente' Beer which is very similar to Miller Light and I spent the week experimenting (which was fun). We also found the other vacationers polite and personal, quite and respectful of everyone. The other hotels on site were the Dominica and the Punta Cana, which were more loud with more of a wild upbeat party atmosphere and less than a 5 minute walk or quick golf cart ride away, So the Bavaro was the best of both worlds a little more subdued when you wanted to relax, with a party happening just steps away. I would highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro to anyone who is looking for a relaxing beach vacation with all your cares taken care of.

<Content>Iberostar bavaro - Great Resort Just returned from our stay - March 4-9th and it was not long enough!!! We are 2 single ladies who have traveled to Mexico and this was our first Punta Cana trip.Much has been written on this resort, and I followed the reviews prior to going to the Iberostar and they were very accurate.I am only going to submit my impressions as additional feedback in hopes it helps those planning to stay here.Check In - while I had read about the warm greetings, etc. We did not experience anything special - we had requested a second floor renovated room and if possible ocean front. We were informed we had a renovated room, seond floor - as requested - I asked if oceanfront were possible and was flatly told our room was very nice - garden view. We were taken to our room on a golf cart which was very helpful. The gentleman who drove us carried our bags to the second floor. ( When we were leaving I asked if there was a price difference etc, in the event we return next year - never got a solid answer as to a price difference, but was told that the only tour group who is guaranteed a ocean front room is based in Germany. None of the United States travel agents, tour groups have oceanfront rooms listed in their contracts - if one is available on check in they will try to accomodate you. I am not sure if you book directly if you have the oceanfront room as an option - we went through a travel agent)Reception area - made our dinner reservations - allowed 2 reservations for a 5 nite stay - had read on Tripadvisor about one restaurant - La Couples - that restaurant was not in the book they offered us with the menus - so I asked about it - it was listed in a separate book which she had not offered - she then brought that menu out and we booked that restaurant (no children allowed) and the Steak House.(We met a gentleman on our way home who said he just went to the Reception area and continued to book other reservations while he was there - they were there 6 nites and ate in all the specialty restaurants - he commented the restaurants had openings so he was able to book them )Room - #1073 - closer to the main reception area was beautiful and very clean. The resort layout was great for us. Each building houses 4 suites and it is more like staying in your own apartment than being housed in a large hotel. We never heard our neighbors and it was a beautiful setting.When we entered our room we were surprised to see the sheer drapes knotted with flowers artfully arranged. Towel animals with flowers were in both the living area and the bathroom.There is a safe in the closet which uses a key pad to lock. It is $2 a day and you need to ask for a key to use the safe - do this at check in.The only funky thing with the room was there was no dresser. The large closet has a shelving unit, or cubby hole unit, that we used to put our clothes on. There are no pants hangers so if you think you will need them you may want to take them.I was impressed with the bed - it was very comfortable. I left a note asking for extra pillows and they were provided quickly.The room had no musty smell. There is a separate living room area which had a sofa and coffee table. There is a small refrigerator which had soda, beer and water. There is a coffee pot, with set ups for tea, coffee, and surprisingly, Splenda! Sugar was also provided. There is a separate shower and tub unit. in the bathroom. The shower stall has a unit which provides shower gel and shampoo, but they also provide small bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body gel, and soap daily. The shower pressure varied daily but seemed to be much better first thing in the morning.The balcony had a sofa, table and chair - we took a citronella candle to burn while sitting there, but never saw any mosquitos.Food - we ate at the buffet for 3 nites - wednesday nite is lobster nite - although they call them King Prawns - they were delicious and are baked right on the grill.We also received notice - under our room door - of a beach party on Monday - here they make a seafood paella which was great. They also had a band which made lunch a lot of fun!We ate La Couples - definately order the lobster salad as an appetizer. We had the the beef which was excellent.The Steak house was also very good - the rib eye was wonderful and very flavorful.We found the buffet to be wonderful - breakfast was great as was lunch and dinner - there is a great variety and something for everyone.We used room service twice - once very late for pizza - and once for sandwhiches on the day we checked out. The food was very good, and delivered within 30-40 minutes. Drinks - a large selection - each nite a drink is featured by the lobby bar. There were some premium liquors but you had to ask - they did have Stoly's and Smirnoff vodka, Jim Beam, Beefeaters. Contrary to what I read they did not have Baileys - they use a brand called Bradleys - it has the same flavor just not as thick.The frozen drinks are not very strong, we asked for extra rum, and it was added with no problem. We are not routine beer drinkers, but tried the Presidente on draft and liked it.The wine is a spanish wine. It was ok. They also have champagne, (or a sparkling wine) which was good.Beach - excellent - we have been to riveria maya twice, and found the beach here to be far superior. There are no rocks in the sand. They are constanly raking the beach and cleaning it up. The water was warm, and there are a few areas wih rock in the water but it is not a problem. You can walk for miles on the beach.There are plenty of lounge chairs, and huts. However if you wanted to spend the day under a little hut, you needed to get to the beach early - I went down one morning at 7:20 and all the front roll huts were reserved with towels. I was able to get one in the second roll. I watched an older couple come down around 10 only to find they could not find a hut.There is a beach bar near the huts to the right.There is a flea market on the beach which we visited twice. You can barter and should as the prices are ridiculous. I found this experience to be daunting as some vendors were loathe to barter. One vendor was asking for $15 for a tee shirt which was inferior to the same shirt for $11.99 in the gift shop. After making 2 small purchases, I opted to shop in the gift shop as I felt the bartering was strained and I did not enjoy being called to or having my arm grabbed to buy the item. I understand the reason for this but had a difficult time with it. Pool- lots of loungers, but the loungers with coverings (were reserved with towels fairly early - but you could find other loungers wiht no trouble. The pool is beautiful - the pictures on the web site do not do it justice.There is a swim up bar, and a bar by the pool. There is a restaurant there for lunch and late breakfast. This restaurant serves as the Steak House in the evening.Staff - cannot say enough about the staff - friendly, cheerful and very helpful. They made the trip that much better.We had a problem with our key one nite, went to the front desk, the promptly rekeyed them, and sent us back with one of the staff to make sure it worked. The staff work numerous positions throughout the day and work very long days, yet they constantly smile and inquire if you are having fun. THEY DESERVE ALL THE TIPS YOU CAN GIVE THEM.We left little gifts for our maid, with a note indicating they were being given to her, signed our names and room # - she replied with a little note. I think the room would have been just as clean irregardless, but they work so hard, they really do deserve the tips.Casino - there is a casino in the Iberostar Dominica - few slots and tables. Had no luck there and did not find the staff there to be overly friendly.DC 6 Disco - in the Dominica - had fun there - younger crowd though.Check out - while it was easy, after we paid the safe charges, the gentleman commented that we owed him towel keys - I told him that we handed everything in - we had put our room key and towel key in each paper holder and turned them in that way. I would suggest that you lay them out on the counter. I asked him to look at what I gave him and he commented he would have the maid check the room - and made no attempt to retrieve the key holders I gave him.Telephone- if you need to call home - check with your travel group - our trip was through a travel agent who used Funjet Tours. We met our representative the day after our arrival and he was very helpful. He suggested we get our phone cards through them(also heard this suggestion at the check in area) We bought a card for $15 for 20 minutes. It worked perfectly - you need to call the operator ask for an outside line - decline their offer to connect you and dial the 1 809 number on the card.We had many problems with phone cards in Mexico but this was not the case here. The connection to the United States was quick, and very clear.Weather - we panicked - the day we left we check the forcast - it predicted rain, and showers every day! The weather was 85-86 dailey - blue skies! We had one night of heavy rain from 10 pm -? but the next day you could not tell it even rained.Grounds - absolutely gorgeous! there are peacocks everywhere and while beautiful, they are extemely loud!!! Whoever advised to bring earplugs was right on the money as they rise around 6-7 and crow - if you are a lite sleeper it may bother you.The tiles that I read so much about are slippery when they get wet so be advised - we ran to our room in the rain but took off our shoes, as the tiles were tough to negotiate.Electricity - the lights in your room will go out when you leave and relight when you open the door - good conservation stategy. We did experience 2 brief blackouts - less than 5 minutes - we took a small flashlite which we kept on the bedstand.Water - our funjet rep advised us not to drink the faucet water which we didn't and they do provide a gallon jug of water which we kept in the bathroom near the sink to use for toothbrushing.There are bottles of water in the refigerator.All in all it was an excellent stay and we will definately go back. It is a beautiful resort with friendly staff.We have stayed at the Riu Palace, and Riu Palace Riveria Maya in Playa Del Carmen Mexico and were more impressed with the Iberostar Bavaro atmosphere and definately found the beach to be much much better.

<Content>Beautiful Resort!!!!! We just returned from our holiday with our two kids - Age 14  11 from Feb. 20-27, 2007. We have been to Peurto Plata in the Dominican before and stayed at the Occidental chain of hotels and would have to say that the Iberostar chain is far more superior quality than Occidental. We had great weather, the kids loved the resort - lots to do if you want to join the activities. The resort was a little overwhelming if you are not use to large crowds. It is not that personal and we found tipping did not make a difference with the bartenders. There is too many people for them to remember one face....although the buffet restaurant servers did remember us. We did not frequent the ala a carte restaurants because did not think it was necessary. The choices at the Buffet were sufficient for a week. If you were there for two weeks, I would recommend the change. People must remember though that you cannot eat like you are at home because the food is different (oils they cook w! ith, milk, etc.) and you will more than likely get a mild to moderate case of diarrhea at some point in your holiday with all the extra alcohol you are also consuming. The people who gave this hotel/resort a bad review have to be extremely picky and must realize that they are among the priveliged few that can afford the luxury of going to a hot spot and that these people work hard, away from their families to make a mere pittance of what we make and they sure don't deserve any crap that tourists give them. The grounds are immaculate and gorgeous and very, very large. The pool was great! The walkways get very slippery when wet but a very beautiful when not wet. I wore barefeet everywhere. One word of advice - if you do not like to barter, don't do it because there prices are out to lunch and by the time you are done, you can get it cheaper at the stores in and around the resort. We took our kids on the Outback Safari excursion and recommend it because it opens there eyes to how the real Dominican people live - the resort sugar coats all of this. This is the only excursion which shows them the people and countryside. They feel very lucky after seeing that!! Also, don't believe the tour guides about buying goods on this excursion because they are just as pricey as anywhere else you go - they must be making a cut or something. We also went on the Caribean Festival tour to swim with the nurse sharks and the stingrays - which is only neat if you have kids. They throw everyone in the ocean at the same time to go snorkeling - people are kicking each other and you are all next to each other - not too fun and as for swimming with the sharks and stingrays - not too exciting and very controlled - I feel sorry for these mammels. Snorkeling was great in front of the resort, when it is calm. The water gets murky when it is too windy.We went for sun and a relaxing family vacation and it was all of that!! I highly recommend this resort. One thing I wasn't sure about is our room - not really made for a family. There was 4 of us and they gave us a room with two twin (I think they are considered doubles??) beds which my husband and I could not sleep in together and they had put a cot in there and made up one side of the couch's, which are hard as a rock. It was a good thing my 11 year old is fairly short for his age because he barely fit there and it was so hard, his little body was sore in the morning - we had to keep switching beds. If you have a family, make sure and request a room with two king beds or make sure the doubles are really double size. That was the only downside to our accomodations. The musty smell wasn't as strong after a few days of getting use to the humidity.  You also cannot get U.S. cash at the hotel - which I find strange because everything is quoted in U.S. dollars and most people pay in American money and when you take cash to the front desk, they won't even give you smaller denominations - you have to go to the store in the lobby. You can only cash your travelers cheques into Peso's so come with enough U.S. money to last you because if you have to go to a Bank for cash, they will surcharge you for that too. Always somebody trying to make an extra $$ wherever you go. Beware of people coming up to you and taking your picture with them or a monkey, parrot or monkey because later that evening, you can buy a picture of yourself for a mere $8.00 U.S. and when you first enter the airport - they take your picture with two Dominican ladies which you can buy when you leave for the same price. (Another money scam)!! Wow, they know all the tricks. Just like the $20.00 U.S./person charge you must pay before leaving the country???! And of course, the extra money you have to pay to the airline to get to sit together on the plane - what a money grab that is - you would think you have paid enough for your tickets as it is that they would at least sit you together as a couple or a family, but NO!!! The worst part of any trip, I would have to say, is the flight times and seating. It is an exhausting two days to say the least but must be worth the hot holiday! Just remember, you are not at home and should not expect the same comforts. Penny0, Saskatchewan

<Content>Nice Resort - Slippery When Wet Though! Just got back from 4 days/5 nights at the Bavaro. Beautiful beaches (but remember to go grab a chair by 7am every morning if you want a good spot), great staff, and pretty scenery. There was a good mix of Americans, Canadians, and Europeans (especially French). The food was above average for an all-inclusive resort. The evening shows were also great.The only thing to PLEASE watch out for are the pathways. Once they are wet, they are VERY VERY SLIPPERY. DO NOT walk on them with bare feet - myself, and several friends took very bad (sober) falls when just walking around - one broke her wrist, another badly sprained an ankle. It's better to just walk on the grass or wear solid, rubber-bottom shoes.Have fun!

<Content>Beautiful Resort, with Helpful Staff I stayed at this resort from Feb. 25 through March 2nd with my wife and 1 year old daughter. The resort is very child friendly and the staff at the resort were falling all over themselves to get to my daughter the whole time we were there. She loved all of the attention! I must say that all of the positive reviews I read were right on. This resort is beautiful with extremely well kept grounds. The staff, especially the wait staff go out of thier way to make your stay comfortable. The room was spacious and updated and included a sunken living room which added just enough extra space. The food was good although it does start to get repetetive after a few days. But you are going to find this at most all inclusives. The food was still of high quality and was delicious. The beach has plenty of room for all of the resort guests. As an added bonus, if you stay at the Bavaro you can go and eat or play at the other two Iberostars: Dominicana and Punta Cana which are right next door. However, guests at the other resorts can not come over to the Bavaro. The drinks seemed to be a bit weak for my taste but since it is an all inclusive you can make up for that by asking for extra rum, gin, etc in your drinks. The activities at the resort are lots of fun and the nightly shows for the most part were very good.Overall, I would highly recommend this resort to anyone, especially families looking for a beautiful resort that is child friendly. My wife and I would go back without hesitation.

<Content>MeltDown in Paradise Coming to you just outside Syracuse, NY where just 45 miles away 12ft. of snow dropped within 10days! Needless to say we were anticipating our annual Caribbean Vacation to be a renewaland a recharging of our batteries! Iberostar Bavaro came through like a CHAMP! We are long time Tripadvisor members who not only take the time writing reviews but really depend on everyoneelse to assist in formulating our trip strategy. The reviews on this resort were right on the mark from the buildings to the beach to the service. I will follow my usual format which I think is really easy to follow:AIRPORT: you will be filling out a visitor card on the airplane, this card is useless however the info that needs to be answered you will need for their official visitor card along with another tourist card that entitles them to $10 per person after you pass through customs. I forgot about the picture that is taken of your group or family as soon as you pass through the front entrance after deplaning. THIS IS NOT A GOV'T ID. This picture will be for sale when you are flying back ..just so you know!! know who your shuttle service is and please know the baggage handlers really do not speak or understand english, they are polite and really are a godsend if a strong back is needed!RESORT PROPER--Iberostar Bavaro is one of three resorts joined together on the same huge grounds and super long beach. Bavaro is all Junior Suites where the Dominicana and the Punta Cana are a combination of rooms and suites. The ride from the airport is around 25 minutes unless your shuttle is dropping prior to your stop is typical of most trips where true poverty is apparent until you arrive at the entrance to Bavaro. Our shuttle driver even stopped for all us to get a cold cervasa to get the holiday started (he drank coke). CHECK-IN-- Our checkin went extremely smooth, ask for Juliana, great smile and english is not a problem either speaking or understanding. They will serve you a bahama mama very cold and very welcomed. The check-in package will have the following, 2 towel cards, two door keys, a map of the complex, a key for the safe( I'll review that in the room section). The guest services are right next to the registration area to the left (important later when restaurants are discussed) They will take your luggage and have it your room within 10--15 minutes. They never asked for a credit card for incidentals so don't vollenteer remember ALL INCLUSIVE!ROOMS-- VERY IMPORTANT...email a week or two before asking for a newly renovated room( email address is reservaspuj@iberostar.com ATTENTION--Rafael Sanchez ). It looks like to us that according to their map those rooms are the closest to the pool area. The number we were in was # 1196. This room was great, new floor tile, bathroom fixtures with standup glass shower. King size bed which was very comfortable . The room had a step down sitting area with a fully stocked refrigerator( they restock auomatically every other day)The room also had an overhead fan that when the a/c was turned down was quite adequate. Glass sliding door to a decent size patio/deck with a drying apparatus to the right for all the wet clothes. The TV at night has a few english speaking stations on them but remember DC is an hour ahead of the US. The safe key given to you at checkin needs to inserted on the back of the safe in order for the digital keypad to work, very easy to use and very safe.Housekeeping was super with us tipping $3 everyday and a few more on the last day. The only room problems we had were at night there was a slight sewer gas smell in the bathroom which we countered with by using a scented candle and there is a musty smell when you first walk in the room which we can only attribute to the humidity. After a few days we just got over it!!!RESTAURANTS-- There are 13 restaurants( including 2 buffets) that are available to you because you are at the Bavaro. We recommend that the very next morning, they are open at 8:00 a.m., make your reservations for your stay. We ate at the Japanese, Bavaro steak house, and the French called Le Couples. They were all super however to our suprise Le Couples was the best!!! I read the hot lobster salad was to die for and it is! The service is great and one more thing, the white wine in this restaurant is a better quality wine that you will find at the resort outside bars. The entire meal was fantastic, ask for Alex, I promise he will keep your glass full!La Ballena( 7--10:00 a.m.) is where we had the breakfast buffet every morning ( ask for Juan Martinez), this overall was very good, the selections were fresh with eggs to order anyway you wanted along with all the fruit and juice you could inhale. The evening buffet is also located here (6--10:00 p/m/) , the only short coming of the entire property is the evening buffet. The selections were just adequate, and please we know about all-inclusive buffets in several islands, this one here is average to moderately acceptable! Breakfast is also served at the buffet area next to the pool, that starts for the late risers at 10--12:00., this is also where lunch is served and let me tell you every day we had super selections and all you could eat all being served with very creative presentations. The breakfast and lunch buffets were superior to our last few resorts!POOL-- Huge with palapas and lounge chairs all throughout. The water temperature was around 75% and they were constantly cleaning in and around the pool area. The towel, ceramics shop, ping pong tables, book exchange hut, kids pool area, and public restrooms( very clean w/ changing areas) are all on the right side of the pool. Extremely close to the beach which gives you the best of both worlds. Be Careful around it very slippery when wet!!BEACH --IT GOES FOREVER and then some..one of the best we have ever seen! The Bavaro,Dominicana and Punta Cana sand all run into each other. WOW! Palapas and lounge chairs galore. Guess what though? You still need to get up early whether it's the pool or beach you want to reserve a decent location, I know it's againest the resort policy and all that is sacred but....by the way I mean getting up at 6:30==7:00 a.m., shame isn't it? The right side of the beach has a Bazaar that has a dozen shops where you buy anything from coffee to t=shirts to cuban cigars. Barter well but let them make a decent living, that was our mantra anyway!MIsc.--- grounds are impeccable, Star Employees who are responsible for all the daily activities also are the entertainers at night. They all ge an A+ for their dedication and hard work to ensure that the evening shows are crowd interactive and most of all fun! We went on the OutBack Safari...BIG RIP OFF!! Don't waste your entire day riding around in an open bed truck stopping at prearranged money grabbing shops that the tour guides are surely getting a cut of. It was joke and insult to the Domenican People. Tipping will certainly make you feel better knowing that you will be responsible for the few that get them in assisting them and their families!!We will go back to Iberostar Bavaro in a few years to renew our love affair with the island and THAW OUT!

<Content>A Fantastic Experience... February 20, 2007Fantastic Place...My wife and I spent the last week at the Iberostar Bavaro Punta Cana. The weather was really tropical and sunny. It was in the mid-80's during the day and the 70's at night. Perfect-especially considering it was 8 at home in Michigan. The best resort experience we have ever had.What we really liked...1. The suites were neat and well maintained. We read about a musty smell in the rooms. We were able to eliminate this by  opening the patio doors for a couple of hours each day and by keeping the lid closed on the toilet.2. The grounds were beatiful and at night the ground lighting created a romantic effect in the landscaping.3. It was quiet and peaceful almost all of the time. Not many  loud drinking parties.4. The staff was friendly and energetic. They performed task with a positive attitude. We often observed them singing to the background music. They were not intrusive or or patronizing. They carried themselves with dignity and were appreciative of tips-while not acting as  though they expected to be tipped.5. The beach had numerous palm thatched cabana's. We  able to reserve one every day. We spent most of the day on  the beach. You could be in the sun or in the shade. The water was a tropical blue with darker shading over the  coral reefs.6. There was constant activity on the beach and just off shore. People constantly walked the beach-about 10% of  the women are topless. There are power boats, sail boats  para sails up and down the beach.7. The snorkeling in front of the Bavaro was very good and  snorkel equipment was free for one hour each day. Yellow  tail snapper (some a foot long) and barracuda, sargeant  fish, and tripletail were within 200 feet of the beach.8. We are in our 50's and enjoyed the contact with the families  with young children. The parents and the children were well mannered. The staff does a nice job entertaining the  children. Every night the kids were involved in putting on  little shows.9. The food was generally of good quality-but not necessarily geared to American tastes. You had to pick and chose. We  liked the grilled foods the best- chicken, lobster, steak and  the chips and salsa. On Wednesday night, they serve lobster  at the buffet. Choose to go to the specialty resturants on  other nights. We liked the Japenese and the Steakhouse  the best.10. Most of the drinks were rum drinks, but you could get other  types of drinks on request. Tipping always helpsThe Bavaro appeared to be much more upscale than the other two Iberostar properties

<Content>Lovely place, would go back My husband, 20 month old son and I just returned 2/10/07 from a week. We were looking for a good all inclusive hotel that was kid friendly but not crazy with kids and Bavaro was just right. The rooms were good for getting a good nights sleep (the crib could have been better and if you have a pack n' play, i would bring it) and the staff was very nice and friendly and great with kids. I so appreciated that there was enough shade both at the beach and the pool. The food was just fine and quite good for an all inclusive that is feeding so many people. There was food all day and enough to chose from. I was not impressed by the ala carte restaurants, but it was nice to have a change of pace and to be waited on but really the buffet had better food. We were very impressed with the grounds. They take such good care of them. It was so well groomed and lush and clean, a really welcome sight. We had a relaxing week and I was happy for what we got. I would not rave and say it was excellent, but totally acceptable for the price and no complaints. They do a good job, and if they keep it up, we will go back.

<Content>Loved The Bavaro As in so many other reviews I must post that everything was incredible. Specialty restaurants were very good , gourmet being the best. Buffet was good both at the beach and main buffet. The thing that draws me back is the staff, everyone doing as much as humanly possible to make your stay there the best. Any questions E-Mail me @  Norscaner@hotmail.com.

<Content>Incredible vacation destination and resort We have just returned from an incredible 5 day vacation at the Iberostar Barvarro Resort. This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic and it will definitely NOT be the last. The resort was fantastic, the layout and facilities are convenient, the grounds are spotless and impeccably groomed, staff is always cleaning, pleasant and speak hello, and the beach is so beautiful it's almost difficult to describe accurately. We read many reviews before our trip and most were very positive, but several were critical. After our visit I can only think the critical reviews were from the travelers that tend to be extremely difficult to please. We used Apple Vacations and had a smooth entry without delay through the Punta Cana airport and customs. Our transfer to the resort was quick, about a 30 minute ride. The roads were a little bumpy at times, but OK for the most part (much better than we experienced in Jamaica). Check-in was smooth, approx. 15 minutes. Upon arriving we were initially booked in an unrenovated room, we requested a renovated room on the 2nd floor and a $20 had us relocated to a nicely renovated room within minutes.We were in room 1057, located in a building on the outside row of the resort. It was peaceful, however our balcony overlooked the land clearing next door for a new resort. It wasn't noisy, but neither attractive. Not really a problem for us because if we want to relax we usually do that at one of the bars or at the beach. Balcony is large with table, chair and small built-in sofa. Our room was very nice. We had 2 double beds, not a problem, we moved the nightstand, pushed the beds together and made a large king ourselves. The sitting area is a step down and has two sofa areas, tables and TV. Mini fridge stays stocked with Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, and water. I think it's refilled every other day. Not a problem since you can get beverages somewhere at all times. 24 hour room service is great and the meals we ordered at 1:00 am were incrediblely tasty. The bath is great, separate tub, large glass shower with shampoo, soap dispensers, and ceramic tile. No outlet adapters were needed as I had read somewhere. Maid service kept room spotless at all times. First day we had the little cut flowers throughout the room and noticed tiny ants in the bath. We flushed the flowers, killed the ants, and told maid we were allergic and No More Flowers and not a problem after that. Left $2 and small gift each day.We usually awake and go to beach at 7:00 am and placed our own towels on beach chairs and palapas (thatched umbrellas on the beach), there are an abundance of chairs but the palapas go fast. Best little secret are the palapas is the area at the right side of the resort, there is a beach bar in the middle of several palapas. Also serves hotdogs, fries, grilled ham/chz. FYI for family vacationers, this is a topless beach. Not obscene, but we wouldn't bring our children. The pool is very beautiful, many chairs and umbrellas, swim-up bar, restaurant and eating areas. We just happen to prefer the beach and it was definitely the most beautiful beach we have ever experienced and we've been to Jamaica, Nassau, Ixtapa, Cancun  Cozumel for comparison.We have been to several all-inclusive resorts even a 5-star and the food at this resort far exceeds what we've experienced elsewhere. Wed night is Lobster night at the buffet, also had roasted pig, oyster bar, and sushi. We ate at the steak restaurant, ribeye had minimal fat and very flavorful...no steak sauce needed. We had reservations at the Japanese, but we decided to check-out the sports bar beforehand and were pleasantly surprised they had a great menu and decided to eat there and had great nachos, steak fajitas, steak, beer-battered shrimp. It was a great sports bar with several TV's including a large big-screen, pool tables, and surprisingly...Air Conditioning, since several restaurant areas are in outdoor covered areas. Enjoyed the sports bar so much that we didn't make it to the highly recommended Japanese rest.Each night there is Entertainment, conveniently located next to the open area lobby bar, which is very large and always has a table or bar stool available. The nightly shows were actually entertaining, more so than most resort Entertainment we've seen.There are shopping markets up the beach to the right. Haggling is necessary, expect to pay about 25% of the first price your given. Many items in the gift shop are very reasonablly priced.For the most part they do expect guests to adhere to the 12:00 noon check-out. However, we had a 4:40 pm return flight, so they took our bags and when we were ready to shower they have 2 rooms/shower areas located right off the lobby that guests with late flights can use. We checked out of our room and stayed at the beach until 1-1:30, took a quick shower, and then caught a 2:00 shuttle to the airport. Sorry to be so lenghtly, I have tried to cover as much as possible to be helpful in your resort choice. This is a resort that we will definitely be returning to in the very near future.

<Content>Very pleasant stay My extended family and I spent a week at the Iberostar Bavaro in Jan 2007. I am generally skeptical of all-inclusives and tend to avoid larger resorts, but I must admit that we had an excellent experience at I-B. Our room was not as large as I would have expected, but it was ample for me, my wife, and our son. It was in good condition and cleaned regularly. The beach was exceptionally beautiful, and the pool was nice though a bit cold. There were a lot of people but the resort rarely felt overrun. The crowd was predominantly European / Canadian, which has its pluses and minuses. And despite some of the reviews about food here, my family and I found the food to be generally excellent, and they tend to be discriminating eaters. Overall, the food from the buffets was freshly-made, well-spiced, and had a lot of choices. Also appreciated were the ubiquitous fresh fruit. We don't drink a lot of alcohol, but the drinks did appear a bit watered down, which is to be expected at any all-inclusive, I would imagine. We did go to 3 of the non-buffet restaurants (Mediterranean seafood, Japanese, and Cajun) and found only the Cajun to be disappointing. The evening entertainment was predicably tacky but still quite enjoyable as well. Overall, we found ourselves satisfied with our time there.

<Content>Stunning! My wife and I (late 50's) stayed at IBB for the week of F7-14. This is the first AI resort of many we have been to that we have decided to rate 5 Stars. It deserves it.We had never been to PC before and so I spent a lot of time reading reviews on TA and the other one as well as looking at tons of pictures on some 20 resorts on the Bavaro strip (plus a few in LaRomana). To get an overview, I first added up all the rankings of each Resort over thae past 100-150 reviews for each and then compiled the % that had said 4 or 5 stars, the % that had said 3 and the % that had said only 1 or 2. One had to start somewhere. When I did all this, I quickly saw that IBB, IBHD (LaRomana) and Majestic had a material higher Great rating (4 o5 5) than the others. These ratings were in the mid 80% range. There were then about 5-7 more resorts that came in with hi-70% ratings----and so on down the line. Only then did I start to read any of the comments or look at pictures.After doing all this legwork, I showed my wife 6 different resorts that were possible maybes. She threw out 3 based on pictures and said she would be happy with any of the final 3--Which were IBB, IBD and Caribe/Topical Princess. Based on that I booked IBB back in October when it was on sale for C$1422 out of Toronto. The price rose back to $1550-1600 on Nov1 and stayed there until early January (for a F7 departure) and then dropped significantly for 2 weeks towards $1200 and then sold out.Our initial concern about IBB before going there (unfounded) was solely the potential size and extent of walking that might be necessary - based on pictures, it looked like a long walk on the main pathway from the lobby to the pool/beach but after talking with others who had been there we decided to go for it. Were we ever glad that we did. For IBB is in no way a football stadium effect that several of the other larger resorts conveyed). You sure don't need a tram to get around either IBB or IBD.Following are our comments on IBB itself as well as how I thought it ranked looks wize relative to some 15-20 other resorts that I alone walked through (beach to lobby and back)---IBB was easily the clear Leader in the looks department in my view and I can now easily see why it has been listed as Number 1 for quite awhile on TA. In fact my main surprise is how high a few of the other resorts were ranked -my own assessment on some of these was considerably lower.It took 120 minutes from the time we walked into the PUJ terminal and the time we walked into the IBB Lobby. Only 39 minutes of that was the actual bus ride (IBB was the first drop off). Most of the rest of the time was waiting on the bus in the PUJ parking lot waiting for everyone--On our bus, most were going to the Bahia and only 4 of us were going to IBB.Check in was a breeze, bags were put in our suite quickly. We got 2nd Floor in Building 117 which turned out fine (I had emailed the Resort asking for one of 9 other buildings but no luck). Ideally, we might have preferred a building a little closer to the main walkway but the difference was not material and didn't matter. We were about 115 ft from the beach (which is nothing) There is also much less need here to have a pool view as the ambiance of the gardens is appealing in itself. Also, being back from the beach means you're also closer to the buffet so being roughly in the middle would be great.We immediately noticed that the walk from the Lobby perpendicular to the beach was actually quite short. It took us only 3.5 to 4minutes for us to walk the entire length lobby to pool/beach. (ps-you can easily see the ocean from the pool as it has an open look.)Our room was spacious, bathroom was private with floor length smoked glass door. Our only small disappointment was that it had 2 double beds pushed together rather that 1 larger bed --so what. We quite liked being on the 2nd floor (more privacy, better view of the gardens). Fridge restocked often with as much bottled water or soft drinks as one would want..We were well used to the reserve the palapa game before we came and I was on the beach at about 6:15 am in the dark spreading our towels down. ---Tip--bring back fresh towels to your room in the afternoon as they don't open till 8am---The walk was easy from our room. There are 4 rows of Palapas gong down towards the water and we wanted the back row nearest the beach walkway and these went first, Our palapa was last row and only 50 ' to the right of the beach bar (looking towards the water) and this section was quite quiet all day long--it is on the right side of the beach Washroom/Pool/Ping Pong Tables/Towel booth and we were only 150 ' from the spotless beach bathroom.Even if one got to the beach at say 9.30, you could still find several lounge chairs left although maybe not palapas--in that case, some folks simply lugged the carirs to the far right property line and set up camp without a palapa as that line is for the most part shaded by tall trees. And I noticed that there was even a secluded section in the far corner that no one seemed to use into noon--that was shaded as well.There is some noise around the large pool area during mid day but not as blaring as at some other resorts. Down our way on the beach we could hardly hear the animation staff anyway.For pool people (we are beach types), the large pool is beautifully landscaped and is shaped like a large heart and appears sectionalized even though it is actually the same pool. What was also noticeable was that there were palapas some 20 ' back from the edge of the pool and several trees under which one could put their chairs to avoid the hot sun. The overall effect of the pool scene was quite pictureseque with loads of room. Food was quite good in the beach buffet at lunch, we thought.IBB takes on a stunningly beautiful ambiance when it gets dark. The many lights are placed strategically all over the property and many shine light up through the trees and thereby create an incrediblly picturesque effect. In fact, even if your room was in the worst part of the grounds and the farthest way, you wouldn't really notice the actual walk because the sceenary was so nice and peaceful along the way. All room building are in orange 2 stories (ground +1) throughtout.The Buffet Food was ,in our opinion , excellent for a buffet. I put on 7 lbs eating everything in sight. No sickness or misquito issues at all. And the ambiance around the perimeter of the buffet was itself stunning with all sorts of flamingoes and ducks swimming in the large pond that abuts onto the buffet (with trees and lights galore). Every morning and evening we got a table for 2 along the perimeter as it is an open air buffet and they spray the trees regularly so there were no misquito issues that we noticed (I doubt I had even 1 bite). Sitting at a table at the perimiter looking out at the flamingoes was was worth the price of admissison alone!--gg---I did not see that effect in any of the other 15 or so resorts that I visted along the strip --except at IBD next door (and there the effect was a bit smaller).Note to those who want to visit the alacartes--Men MUST have long pants (not jeans)-- we were turned away as I was in dress shorts. ---btw the walk from the buffet to the nearby french gourmet/cajun restuarants along the pond was as romantic as I have ever seen.If you get a perimeter table in the morning (bring a sun hat) , you will likely be served by Jonathon, a good looking local domincan who is an excellent waiter and who is able to mutil task well. In fact, when his captain put him over on the other side one evening, we missed him and noticed the difference-he was that good.Food in the main buffet is served in a separate room off to the side of the large room where the tables are.IBB'e evening entertainment was as corny as at most resorts (audience particiapation). We had seen better shows at the Allegro in Puerta Vallarta but quite frankly we didn't really care as all shows at these type of resorts become stale to those who are used to them-- I suppose I would rank IBB's shows as slightly below average but it is not something that meant anything to us.One thing that IBB does well and is noteworthy is that for 10 minutes ir so at about 7:30-8 ish every evening 2 of the female entertainers gather about 15 or so of the age 3-7yr olds and parade like a conga line through a few of the tables near the stage singing and then they all go onto the stage and sing some more if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. ta da, If we had been young parents, we would be beaming and taking pictures of our son or daughter in the parade or on stage singing. Not at all intrusive to the overall adult privacy to the placeI thought I would add a section at this time to what my impressions were on walking the beach and going into the many other resorts that I managed to get into without being stopped by security guards. My purpose was to research which might be possible maybes in 2008 if IBB was not then available. I suspected that I might not find one at the same overall ambiance as IBB (I was right) but I wanted to kick the tires so I would know. What follows is simply my own impressions and one should realzie that it is a bit like viewing modern art--some of us might think modern art is neat and appealing while others might think it's wierd. Folks, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and your impressions might well be quite different that mine.The Resorts I went through consisted of all those along the strip from the Majestic at the far Left (looking out to the ocean) over to the Grand Palladium Royal Suites on the far Right (an overall beach walk of 100 minutes if one didn't stop). I chopped my walks into sections over 2-3 mornings. It's a $15 taxi ride from IBB to GP Royal Suites for eg and I could walk backI walked through from beach to lobby (sometimes using their trams) and back again (sometimes looking at their buffets). I obviously did not sample their food or sit around their pools or look in their rooms.These other resorts consisted of the the following---MAJ, Bahia, RIU Palace, RIU Bambu, RIU Macao, RIU Taino, IBD/IBPC, Ocean Blue/Golf, LTI (incl its Cayena section), PC Princess, Trop/Caribe Princess, Paradisus, Bavaro Princess, Oxy grand Flamenco and the 4 Grand Palladiums.The biggest dissapointments to me by far were the Majestic, the Bahia and the Bavaro Princess. Frankly, the MAJ looked like unappealing and drab modern art--no ambiance, nothing picturespque, just an abundance of marble and with relatively little vegetation (in part because it is new). It 's beach width was ok at 70' It was a turnoff to have to walk up several steps to go UP to the Lobby. All in all, no thanks.About 14 minutes to its right is the Bahia Principe. Here the colour looked slomewhat more caribbean ish that the Maj but it's immenseness was a significant detraction, evn if one was in the golden or platinum sections. I got on the tram and went for a ride throughout. No thanks.About 6 minutes to its right is the new RIU Palace, which I didn;t find appealing becuase it was mainly white with little ambiance. The beach width was also far TOO wide at something in the order of 140'--much like the width at the RIU Bambu and RIU Macao nect door. The RIU Taino's beach width was a much better size at 70' (like IBB's) but the Taino's pool was tiny. Both the Macao and the Bambu had high buildings, which also didn't appeal to me. The Taino's looked more inviting with 2-3 story suites although not a pretty as IBB, None of them had buffet ponds with flamingoes swimming by and their dining rooms looked to be closed in (although they had verandahs which didn't look very populated at noonish).One was past the last of the RIU's some 15 minutes going right from the Bahia and onto the IBD/IBPC property which took about 9 minutes to traverse Beach width here was about 115 ' and the beach looked 'busier' than at IBB in that there there many more palapas and most were closer together. The IBD/IBPC buffet had a similar pond/flamingoes effect as IBB just somewhat smaller. Most of the rooms are in 2 long 4 story apartment buildings -the rooms are about the same size as IBB.Going from the right of IBB one first waks past a section of some 40 beach shacks where the locals sell their wares, Next to that are the 2 Ocean properties-which to me looked average, and then the LTI follwed by it' s higher priced Cayena section near the beach and at the end. I thought the LTI itself also looked average and the Cayena part looked prettier but it's beach width looked to me to be only 40' or so. My overall impression was that I would personally not care to pay the Cayena's higher price.Next was the Punta Cana Princess--which in contrast to the Maj and Bahia looked like it was aprt of the Caribbean. Bight red and orange buildings, Was fairly quite though, maybe a bit too quietAdjacent to the PCP was the Tropical Princess and the the Caribe Princess (more or less the same complex). This property looked quite invitning and quite pretty as well. It was not as upscale looking as IBB but it was looked nice to the eye and the bufftet is reasonably close to the pool so you didn;t have to go all the way back to the lobby. I had a fabourable impression of the Trop/Caribe although it seemed a bit noisy on the beach with the blaring microphones-maybe their was a quiter section on the beach that I missed. All rooms looked like they fronted onto one of the pools.To the right was the Paradisus, which ahd the distinction of being the only place with full length bed mattresses on the beach, which were comfortable and apealing--but not in my view worth the extra price of this resort.Next was the Bavaro Princess, a huge resort seriously in need of not only fresh paint but also gay orange/red ish colours. I got on the tram and went a long way inland to the lobby and then back. No thankyou.Next was the Oxy Flamenco--which to me might look promising to a new owner who might then paint the place. The bright red colour on the walkway in the pictures is a faint and much blander colour in real time for eg. Overall, this property might look much more inviting with fresh paint throughout.To it's right is the GP Complex. I walked off the beach and got onto their tram and drove through the entore large complex, which overall looked to be too large. The Palace and Royal Suites sections looked nice. The entire property was very well kept up and was pleasing to look at. Paint was no problem hereTime to close this off----In summary, we would return to IBB in a heartbeat and I can now well understand why it is Top Rated in Punta Cana on TA . As I see it, there is no close 2nd at this time but that is just my perspective ( ionsys@gmail.com )

<Content>Fair and Balanced Review! My wife (and several other couples) enjoyed a week at the Iberostar Bavaro. Here's the deal:1. The Punta Cana Airport is an open air, modern thatched-roof building, and actually very nice. When you clear customs, be ready for the porters, who literally will fight to carry your bags to the bus. We needed to fend them off, since we had a lost bag issue (thanks a lot United - both coming and going), but would recommend dropping a couple of bucks to the porters since the buses are often 100yds out into the parking lot. 2. Iberostar Bavaro First Impression: This is a beautiful resort. Impeccable landscaping, peacocks, flamingos, spacious modern rooms, and overall a very well put together resort. We had no problems at check in, and we threw back a cold Bohemia beer during the process. 3. Dining: I have to agree with previous posters in some regards. If you're looking for Nobu (or even Benihana) - don't try the Japanese restaurant. The service here was terrible, even on the night when the Chief Executive's daughter (and resort GM) were sitting across the room. Yikes. We enjoyed the steak house and the Cajun restaurants. The service at these two were excellent. All other meals are at one of the buffets. The breakfast buffet was great. Eggs to order, bacon, fresh fruit, smoothies, interesting breads and cheeses. The lunch buffet (by the pool) was fine, and particularly good when they made paella. It did get repetitive, but it was totally acceptable to wander over and grab a plate (remember, at lunch we're coming off the beach in our bathing suits - do you really need waiter service for that - and they do come around and take drink orders) and eat a reasonably good meal. They had burgers, roasted chicken, salad, pizza, etc. Plenty of choices. At the main dinner buffet, I found that there were always plenty of choices - fish, roast beef, roast suckling pig (seriously delicious), and many many other options. You must realize that this is not a major metropolitan area where top chefs are plating Osso Bucco. Then again, you're not paying $35 an entree either.People: We've been to a number of resorts in the Caribbean, and I thought that the Dominicans were the most hospitable of all (only barely edging our friends in Mexico). Learn some Spanish phrases - would it kill you to say Gracias? Hola? Cafe con leche por favor? People were happy and pleasant and eager to please. I would also recommend generosity in tipping. Leonardo and Basilio at the beach bar (which we made a ritual of closing daily) essentially MADE our vacation.Entertainment: If you asked me (before my vacation) if I thought I would be on stage at all during my week, I would have told you  no way. Well, that didn't quite work out, and I had a great time as did our friends who also participated (and oh my...). Get involved, and have fun with it. The star friends work very hard away from their kids and spouses for weeks at a time, and they are all good and talented people trying to make a living. Get to know them! Off Campus:I HIGHLY recommend taking the horseback riding trip. We had a guide all to ourselves (after a 45 min ride to the ranch), and we went several miles up a beautiful palm-lined deserted beach to a gorgeous river delta. This is the Dominican Republic. I'm a lousy rider (not sure if my horse was named Rocket ,Thunder or Widowmaker but he was actually very well trained), and it was still an experience I'll always treasure. See the vendor in front of the hot tubs. Our friends went 4-wheeling and came back covered head to toe in mud and smiles! Golf: Play the Punta Blanca course - it's a 5 minute cab ride, (adjacent to the Riu) or go through GoGolf. It's $150 including carts, drinks, lunch and a bucket. Tees, greens and fairways are mint. This is a new course, so the waste areas are still not really playable. We played 2 1/2 rounds here and had an absolute blast. We planned on playing LaCana (based on good reviews from other guests) but we had to cancel.Vendors: Take a short walk down the beach for t-shirts, cigars, jewelry, and other souveneirs. Be prepared to haggle - my t-shirt price started at $17 per shirt, and ended at around $4. Smile and have fun with it.Topless: This is common here, be ready and accept the good with the bad - if you know what I mean. It's really no big deal.Weather: Perfect. No more to add here.Have a great time!!

<Content>Great time in the Dominican We relied heavily on Trip Advisor before booking our trip and the Iberostar Bavaro was the only resort in the area that had no complaints. We would like to continue this streak by telling you what a wonderful time we had.Our room was 2591, and was fantastic. The cleaning staff of the Iberostar needs to be commended. Everyday we had something different done with our towels, bedding and drapes AND the room was always spotless. Our bar fridge was refilled on a regular basis and the staff went as far as to fold any clothing we left lying around. The location of this room was great too. It was close to the buffet and lobby bar and just a short walk from the pool and beach. Nice, because you didn't have the constant noise of either location, yet they were close at hand so getting to where you wanted wasn't a problem.THE FOOD:We thoroughly enjoyed the buffet and a la carte restaurants. The a la carte restaurants we ate at were the Mediterranean, the Cajun and the Japanese. We were fortunate enough to be able to book the Mediterranean twice as they have the BEST PAELLA EVER! If you go you must try it. It was simply amazing. The cajun restaurant was also quite good. The Japenese appetizers were excellent, but the main courses were a little disappointing although still very tasty. It was neat to see them prepare the food right in front of you on a giant grill.Try and make your reservations at the a la cartes early in your stay, although sometimes you can get lucky with a cancellation the day of. We had no problems booking for the times we wanted and like I said were able to score an extra visit to the Mediterranean restaurant.The buffet offered a wide selection of food, and while we both suffer from food allergies and picky eating we never had a problem finding something delicious to eat.The poolside bar and buffet were also fantastic. The fajitas were amazing just like everything else. No complaints at all about the food. We didn't encounter any illness or uncomfortableness with any of the food or drinks.THE STAFF:We couldn't have asked for a friendlier bunch of people. Everyone from the gardeners to the animation team was extremely cordial. No language barriers either. We wish we could speak so many languages!The Animation team was great. They encouraged you to get involved but weren't annoying. They left you alone when you didn't want to participate, but encouraged you when you did. They did a fantastic job and the shows in the evening were great at well. Always funny and entertaining.THE BEACH:Amazing. Had a little issue with seaweed, but the grounds crew was out there daily cleaning it up. Never kept us out of the water. It was much worse down the beach, but someone was always picking it up.The sand is so soft you could walk on it for miles and we did. There was always a slight breeze, but it was a refreshing break from the hot sun.The shops along the beach carry the typical souveniers of the area and the owners seemed ready to strike a deal. THE RESORT:After this trip we would have to say we are big fans of the Iberostar Chain. If this resort is any thing like any of the others we can't wait to go. The grounds were meticulously kept and when they were working on a project the mess was kept to a minimum and there was hardly ever any noise. We only saw someone cutting the grass one day, but it always looked well manicured.The birds were great too. We were able to feed the Peacocks right out of our hands!We had no problems finding a chair by the pool or at the beach at any time of day. The temperature of the pool was cool, but nice after sitting in the hot sun. Same with the beach, the water was cool, but fabulous.EXCURSIONS:We did the Aquatic Tour where you get to drive a two seater boat out to a reef, snorkel and then drive back. It was amazing. We would definitely recommend it. One word of caution, the boats are great and go fast, but the steering isn't the greatest. We managed and had no problems, but could see where some could arise. The staff was FANTASTIC. Our guide, Willy, took our underwater camera and got great pictures of the aquatic life, and of us under the water. A definite bonus.THE SPA:If you have a chance to take advantage of the Spa facilities at Iberostar Bavaro, do it. We went for a deep tissue massage the last day of our stay and it was amazing. Unlike any massage I've had in Canada. The ladies did a great job and we felt so relaxed afterward. They do the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet and your scalp in addition to your body. Amazing.OVERALL:We are not ones to return to the same location, but we would definitely consider returning to the Iberostar Bavaro. We had an absolutely fantastic time. If you have the chance you should go too.

<Content>Not really five-star My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from Jan. 27, 2007 to Feb. 3, 2007 and had fairly high expectations considering reviews we read on Trip Advisor plus the relative price we paid compared to the other Iberostar resorts in Punta Cana. Despite being dropped off at the resort at 1:30pm local time, we had to wait two hours before we were let into our room, which was frustrating. Once we got into the room, I have to admit, I was impressed. But, the room was literally the only 5-star aspect of the resort. I know when I read reviews that criticized the food, I thought, It can't be THAT bad. These people are just picky. We'll be fine., but I was wrong. I understand that at other all-inclusives, you get to eat multiple dinners and a few other meals in a traditional menu, waiter, a la carte fashion. At Iberostar, you MUST eat at buffets for every meal except three dinners. I drastically underestimated the effect this can have on one's vacation experience if you're into food AT ALL. Eating the same foods at breakfast, lunch, and dinner off of buffets for seven days got OLD. And the food is definitely geared towards Europeans, which to me means no salt, minimal seasoning, and almost no vegetables. And if you think you can get your money out of the alcohol, think again. No employees walk around offering beverages to people, which means if you want a drink, you have to walk quite a ways to get one.The weather was beautiful, and it only rained a little at night while we slept. The grounds are also gorgeous and well-maintained. We left the resort once to take an excursion to the Marinarium, which I highly recommend. It was the highlight of our trip.Bottom line: I thought a European chain such as Iberostar would have higher standards for food and service than an all-inclusive geared towards Americans. It turns out the opposite was true.

<Content>great deal for the price We were looking for a quickie get away on the beach. The resort is spotless, the staff incredibly friendly, and beach is lovely. The price was quite reasonable. The place is way to big for our taste, but the specialty restaurants helped reduced the expansive feel of the place. We had some of the best meals we have ever had in the Caribbean at the Cajun and gourmet restaurants.The staff are marginal in their English speaking ability, but were happy to help us with our Spanish. You just have to be patient. We walked on the beach a lot. The entire experience was very continental. We could easily have been on the Riviera. Very few Americans there, mostly Spanish, German, French and British. Also a large contingent from Calgary.We took one snorkel trip to the Marinarium. It was a waste of time. The boat was crowded, the coral is dead and it took up 1/2 day of our precious 7 day stay.We scheduled this through the American Airlines website and bought airport transfers. The agent in DR is Prieto Tours. They never came to get us on the departure date and when the front desk called, the boss had left and we were told to take a cab. We did, but it left us in a rush and cost us an extra $33 plus tip for the cab. I would avoid Prieto tours in the future.Otherwise, a place well worth the money. Glad we went. The DR is getting ready to really turn into a large tourist spot. I suggest you go soon to enjoy its beauty.

<Content>emc Just came back from a great vacation. To me the most important thing is weather and we had 85F temperatures everyday. We brought our 2 year old daughter, along with my mom and my sisters family who had 3 kids ranging from 9 months to 5 years of age and they all had great time except for my brother-in-law who was disappointed that he could not access his e-mail from his blackberry. The pool and area were slippery so care needs to be taken when walking around it. There were many slips and falls. It should be resurfaced but I don't know how possible this is.We were concerned about the food being repetetive and boring but that could not be further from the truth. Lobster was served in different forms for 6 out of the 7 days we were there. Everyday they had different main courses ranging from leg of lamb to roast beef. We had stayed last year at the Iberostar Mayan in Cancun and the food there was not nearly as good. The entertainment was phenomenal. Huck, the master M.C was hillarious and the games were fun for all ages.We tipped our servers at least $5.00 for each meal and they greatly appreciated the gesture. These people only make $10.00 per day so any tip will repaid with even better service.

<Content>Ready to go back!!!! My husband and I went here with 4 other couples from Jan 8 -15!! We booked through Apple and that is the way to go. There was a bus waiting for us at the airport, it was air conditioned too! It is very warm when you get off the plane, so we packed some shorts in our carry-on bag and changed on the airplane. We had e-mailed and faxed the hotel a week before we left and requested renovated rooms with a king bed and by the pool. Our request was granted!! Our rooms were very nice and clean. I had brought some little lotions and shower gels to set out for the maid along w/a couple of dollars, and we had fresh flowers in our room everyday, no one else did :).We pretty much hung out on the beach everyday! We had no problem getting a spot right by the beach bar everyday. The weather was awesome, we had a couple of days where it was pretty windy but the sun was still shining!! We did get involved in a couple of the pool games and those were fun.We did attend the shows at night, we also got involved in those and it made them so much better to know someone up on stage. We also hung out at the Star Rock cafe (played some drinking games) and the disco (I don't think it matters how old you are you can still have fun). Take a walk down to the shops along the beach and have some fun haggeling the locals!! We also booked a horse back riding trip from a guy down by the shops and it was awesome!!! We got to ride for 2 hours, went along the beach, was great!!!Get to know the bar tenders (they will also be your servers at night)!! They are alot of fun and are always singing and just enjoying there jobs!!!None of us had anything negative to say about this resort!! We were there to have fun and relax and we did both of those!! We would definately recommended this resort to anyone of any ageand we are all ready to go back!!!

<Content>A Week in Paradise On the recommendation of a friend who had been there, we booked a week in this resort. It exceeded every expectation and we plan to go back next year for a longer stay. The food was excellent and, God knows, more than plentiful. We ate in three of the theme restaurants (seafood, Japanese, French). We probably would not try the Japanese restaurant again鈥攁lthough the beef there was the best we found anywhere鈥攂ut the other two were outstanding. We tipped modestly and service everywhere was excellent ...but I suspect service would have been with a smile without the tipping. Beautiful beach, pool, grounds (with peacocks, flamingoes, geese, egrets). If there was any disappointment, it was the small, smoky casino in one of the other Iberostar resorts.

<Content>great value at the bavaro The accomodations were wonderful, small house type accommodations instead of being in a hotel atmosphere. The service was excellent, we generally tipped 2 dollars a day to our maid and she made sure the mini bar remained stocked. Food was varied and delicious, it would be difficult to not find something to satisify your appetite. The beach and pool area were beautiful, with enough chairs for everyone. The casino was small, smokey, but delightful. Would go back anytime. Great choice and value for the money. Be careful at the airport, hide your money on your person, we were robbed at one of the checkpoints. They are slick and fast. I would not let it stop me from returning however. Just learned a valuable lesson.

<Content>Wow! Great Resort...problems at Punta Cana airport Myself and 5 friends stayed at this resort from 1/25 - 1/29 and it is a wonderful place to visit. Our rooms were great, the beach is great and we found the food to be above average. We would return to this resort. I just want to make women aware of a problem we encountered at Punta Cana airport. An agent that inspects your bags decided to take money from my friends wallet. So please be aware of this and be sure to watch your money. I realize this has nothing to do with the resort but I want to get the word out.

<Content>We Were Amazed! Folks, I went with the reviews on this site and was not disappointed. This was by far one of the most enjoyable places my wife and I have ever stayed. The staff were amazing, the hotel immaculate and the services incredible. We have stayed in many places over the years, which have included many 5 star hotels in Mexico including Golden Paradise and Crown Paradise and this one rates among some of the best. Rooms-excellent, staff- excellent (they never stop dancing and singing), beach-beautiful,. Our special thanks to Gregori (waiter)at the buffet, Sergio/Arne/Jordan at Dressel dive shop, Kennedy at the bar, and of course many more. The only issues I have (I guess everything can't be perfect) was the guest showers on the last day need to be fixed up, when they say checkout is at 12, they are NOT kidding ;), I would recommend sending them a fax, not an email, requesting a renovated room, and be sure when you checkout to head to the airport, you pack some snacks for the wait at the airport. My wife and I had a piece of pizza with a coke each and it was $16 US.I really need to open a few businesses in DR.In summary, there is a reason this hotel is highly rated on the review sites. You will NOT be disappointed. Also, most importantly, take the time to write a review upon your return. I believe they really do serve a purpose for those traveling.Best RegardsRob  HayleyTrenton, ON21-28 Jan 2007

<Content>Never seen so much gray hair... My girlfriend and I (21 and 23 respectively) have just returned from a 7-day stay at the Iberostar Bavaro (Jan 19-26) We extensively read reviews on TripAdvisor before picking a spot to stay... Upon our arrival (night flight... ouch!), we were pleasantly surprised by the room that had been given to us. Following advice from many people on this website, I had sent a request to the hotel for a renovated room near the pool. Our room was spacious with a very nice bathroom and in an ideal location. The 脿 la carte restaurants were excellent, the staff was very friendly and polite and the hotel was kept very clean. LET THIS BE A WARNING HOWEVER TO YOUNGER TRAVELLERS : this is not a hotel for single guys/girls or early 20ish couples... A lot of young families and gray hair !!! Don't be scared off by the couple of bad reviews you'll occasionnally encounter on the site: the food is OK (4 star quality) and the entire place is not a danger to the life of your children...Bavaro beach is shared by countless hotels, so they ALL have a nice beach, if that's your major selection criteria. The iberostar bavaro is a very good 4 1/2 star hotel. Why not 5? Food, entertainment, and drinks selection could be kicked up a notch, but it's just details.Go there, get a nice tan and relax. We'd recommend it... to our parents.

<Content>a little bit of heaven Punta Cana: Iberostar Bavaro, A Little Bit of HeavenDate: Jan.27Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Milwaukee, WIMy wife and I just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana. For one week we thought we had died and gone to heaven!! Everything about the Bavaro was fantastic. I do not understand how anyone could not recommend this resort. I guess some people are just born to complain.The resort complex is huge. Expect to walk a lot. But that is good because the exercise will help you to lose some of the weight gained at all the delicious meals. Breakfasts and lunches are buffets that have plenty of choices for everyone. For dinner, you have a choice between eating at the buffet or making a reservation at one of the 5 a la carte restaurants. All were very good. We ranked them as follows: Gourmet ( have the lobster salad), Japanese, Cajan, Steak, and Mediterranean. Staying 7 days means you have 3 guaranteed reservations at these restaurants. If you want to try more, just go to the lobby in the early afternoon to see if there are openings. Every Wednesday is lobster night at the main buffet. You can also eat at any of the restaurants in the other 2 hotels in the Iberostar complex. We didn't because we were very happy with what we had at the Bavaro. Our room was beautiful. King-size bed, a sitting area with couches and satalite TV. Bathroom was large and our maid did an excellent job of cleaning. And yes, there is a slight musty smell because of the humidity but just bring along a small candle and that will help. We also had a small balcony that we would use in the early evening to breathe in the tropical air!! The suites are located in 8-unit buildings scattered all over the grounds. When walking to the main lobby or to the pool expect to see a lot of peacocks, swans, well-maintained gardens,and palm trees.The beach is fabulous. You can walk for miles in either direction and just admire the scenery.The bars have just about any kind of beverage you could ever want. The bartenders did not skimp on the alcohol and you could ask for top-shelf liquors like Sapphire or Beefeaters, as an example. Everyone was friendly ( you'll learn to say, hola) and the service was top-notch! Bring along plenty of singles to tip because the workers do not make a lot of money and tips are much appreciated.As for excursions away from the grounds, we went on the Outback Safari and the Marinarium snorkeling cruise. Both were well worth it and a lot of fun. Taking the Safari gives you a chance to see some of the beautiful countryside and to see the locals at work or play. All in all, a very relaxing and wonderful vacation. Makes our Midwest winter seem a lot shorter. And yes, we will return!!!

<Content>Perfect Vacation from The Sisters Our stay was perfect to say the least. My sister and I have never been so welcomed to any resort. We have been to the Domician 5 times and this by far one of the nicest resorts.Clean and friendly are the 2 highest points. You could literally eat off the floor and everyone was exceptionally friendly. The weather was fantastic and we were certain the perfect trip must have a flaw.....it didn't.Our room was clean, large and bathroom was marble and exceptional. To explain the service, I accidentally got the shower head to fall apart, not such a big deal as we were leaving the next day but without so much as a phone call it was repaired when we returned to our room the same day. Hot showers, beautiful towels and fresh linen.Food was great, try La Sicila it was great. Don't forget the lobster on the beach, Thanks for a really great holiday!

<Content>Awesome Vacation!  This was my third time going to this resort, and every time it gets better. The staff is so friendly! They make you have so much fun, and they are very funny! The shows are pretty good at night. the only problem is that the dancers need to be better. The beach is VERY beautiful! The water is excellent. We loved the pool but sometimes i didn't feel comfortable going in when there were a lot of little kids. (if you know what i mean). The sun was almost always shining. The buffet was pretty good. If you are someone that expects superb cuisine though, don't get your hopes too high.The room is always nice. Although we had some problems with the rooms last time. We had water dripping from a light fixture in the bathroom over the toilet. We had people come ot fix it, and that onky made it worse. The sliding door was door was very hard to open, so it was partly broken.The room service was alright. I think they need to put more towels in the bathrooms*and when we asked for more, we never got any, even after calling 4 times.*It's a BEAUTIFUL place, and we are going back in 2007! If you want a great vacation to a beautiful Caribbean resort, and not too fancy....STAY HERE!

<Content>Incredibly relaxing, wonderful trip My girl and I planned to write an extensive review of our stay at the Iberostar Bavaro, but alas we did not. So I'll leave a brief one - it was the most relaxing vacation I've ever taken. From the moment we arrived, we started to feel at peace. The resort is beautiful. The beach is fabulous. The pool is cool and comfortable. I wouldn't describe the food as great overall, but we found plenty of foods that we enjoyed and several that we thought were great. A couple:-- Beef plate at the steakhouse (its skirt steak). Absolutely fabulous, along with their melt-in-your-mouth potatoes. Ate there 3 times during the trip.-- Black bean soup at the Mexican restaurant on the Dominica side. Unbelievable.My food motto at the Bavaro: always bet on beef.Our room was completely renovated, comfortable and close to everything (I highly recommend staying in the 2300 block of rooms). The staff was very friendly and helpful. Never had any problems (no doubt in part because we tipped generously, which most people do not).The only thing I wouldn't recommend was the local snorkeling trip. The water was rough and there was nothing to see.In sum, I give the Bavaro my highest recommendation. I would be thrilled to go back. We there from Dec 8 to 18th, which I think is a great time to visit. Not too crowded, excellent weather.

<Content>wow We were there from dec 30, 06 to jan. 6. 07. Had a great time. I was traveling with my husband's side of the family. 17 of us. Everything was perfect. Complaints about the food: absolutly not. Everything was well presented and delicious. Rooms were great for the kids (junior suites). Grounds and beach were very well kept. Even with a big group we always had lots of room at the beach and enough chairs, loved the staff. Took safari with the whole family and had a great day thanks to our guides Julio and Christian. Loved itI highly recommend this resort. Try it, you will see.Hola from Canada

<Content>ok nothing great I have to say that the bavaro to me was just average...it wasnt' terrible but it certainly wasnt fabulous. To me it had more cons then pro's.The first thing that everyone considering going here should know is that it is not very child friendly. If you have a small child this is not a good place. From the unsafe walkways, slippery bathroom floors and useless steps in the rooms a parent with a toddler will not have a minute to relax.All the walkways and pool area are increte which is a painted cement with a design etched in it . when it is wet, which is almost all the time because of the frequent rain storms throughout the day and night , it is very dangerous. One afternoon after a rain storm i watched 2 ADULTS slip and fall. Both were injured. And there are signs everywhere about the slippery surfaces...SO IF THERE KNOW THEY ARE DANGEROUS...GET RID OF THEM. It goes without saying how many children i saw by the pool go down, including my own from just walking and hitting a wet spot.The room was also a hazard. though it was very pretty, the floors were all marble. Mix that with a shower door that is not water tight and once again you have a very dangerous situation for a child. My one year old slammed his head on the floor our first day there when he walked into the bathroom. My 5 year old niece did the same thing a few days later. then there the steps. A 4 foot wide 2 step down which is impossibe to block off.The food was also alitlle lacking. not thay i had anything bad there just wasnt anything that i felt i needed to have again. The buffet was small and didnt offer much of a variety. The menu wasnt child friendly either. If you have picky eaters make sure you bring some stuff from home for them to eat. there were not very many healthy choices either. the veggie choices were lacking but there was alot of unknown fried objects.There wasn't even whole wheat bread at breakfast. and if you ordered room service thy would not bring you a beverage. one night me and my husband wanted a cup of coffee so we called room service..they told us they dont deliver beverages. With 2 small children sleeping it wasn't like we could walk(and i do mean walk) to the buffet to get some.the place is alot of buildings. Its large but it doesnt really have much to offer. The size is mainly due to all of the bungalows.the bavaro has the 5 or 6 resturants, the pool, a few shops and a theater. Which by the way does not have profesional entertainers. it was all audience particpants if that sort of thing matters toyou.The shows are hosted by the same group that does the 20 minutes of pool games in the afternoon. After that there really isnt much more entertainment than that.If you want internet access , the casino, the disco, the doctor, the kids club and mostly everything else you might need on your vacation you need to walk to the next hotel ( think that one was the domincana)the pool was warm enough to actually swim in which was nice. But once again vey slippery for young chidren. There is a large fountain in the middle that when it is windy you get hit with the spray from the fountain. (very annoying).The high point of the bavaro is the beach. Powdery soft sand and a beautiful ocean. Warm and a little wavey. It was mine and my childrens favorite part of the trip. Very nice.To sum this up because of know i am rambling..... the bavaro is lacking considering its 5 star rating. I am not a travel snob i am just honest. I have been to other resorts in the dr and found them to be more enjoyable. Ok for 1 time ..wouldnt go backWould go back to sunscape in Laromona..smaller and alot nicer of a vacation

<Content>Excellent Just returned from a stay at the Iberostar Bavaro (Jan 18-22) and absolutely loved it.  For starters, the resort grounds and facilities are kept very clean. There were people cleaning the facilities multiple times each day. For example, the bathrooms at the pool/ beach area, which get an extraordinary amount of use during the day, were immaculate regardless of what time of day you went in. The presence of the cleaning people almost reminded us of Disney World, where everything is cleaned 100 times a day.The staff was very accomodating and friendly. The food was good, no issues or sickness in our party. The drinks were fine too. If you are looking for gourmet food and top shelf liquors, you probably should not be going the all-inclusive route to begin with.Overall, I would say this was a great place for our long weekend and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing carefree trip.

<Content>Awesome Amazing!!!! Ok so my boyfriend and I read alot of reviews before we went on our vacation, and now that we are home I am reading more just for curiosity sake! I've read about the food being bad, the wind, blah blah complain, complain, and as I look at the source it occured to me, well of course, I'll give you a hint these complainers are not from Europe! It seems to always be the same people that need to complain, if you wanted your Budweiser  apple pie you should of stayed home! The hotel is absolutely beautiful, the staff are very sweet, the entertainment is very fun, catalina and Michael especially, the pool is beautiful, be sure to book a renovted room, white sand beaches with ocean water the color of eutopia, when I was in the ocean the floor was very soft by the way! No problem ever finding a spot on the beach, a little harder at the pool, but I wasn't going to cry into my margarita because of it! The drinks are free poored by smiling, singing staff, so I thought they were just right. Very fun night club at the Iberostar Dominica, lots of latin, hip shaking music! I would recommend this hotel to anybody, now if you want an adult only this isn't the hotel for you.That said my boyfriend and I had a very romantic, fun, relaxing perfect vacation. Ps Eat at the Gourmet restaurant for sure! Pss We found the buffet just lovely, everything you could ever want! Ola!!

<Author>luvthecarribean!
<Content>Cant be #2 rated!! My sister and I stayed there Jan. 5-Jan.12, 2007. We are in our early/mid. 30's. The resort itself and the property is very nice. We stayed in a newly renovated room, although a standard room, and it was perfect. The room had a sitting area and a touch keypad safe. There were always workers cleaning the sidewalks and working on the landscape. Great property!The beach was very nice, too. Although where we usually sat the ocean floor was rocky - dont know if it was like that along the whole beach area or not. Had no problems getting a lounge chair at the beach, although it was a little tougher getting one around the pool. Don't know if this is standard or not....when we were there it was extremely windly out at the beach, but not near as bad by the pool so maybe that's why it was more crowded around the pools. The pools were nice...swim-up bar was nice. Had a small pool for little kids and zero-entry in the bigger pools. Lots of families there. Drinks were fine...not strong. The food was bad. I am not a picky eater at all, but I have to say I was really sick of the food choices (or lack-thereof). For having buffets, there really wasn't much variety. Usually I can find stuff to eat at a buffet no problem, but it was difficult here. Breakfast was really the only good, sure meal. The snack bar/restaurant by the pool was the same...most of the food was the same every day. Needless to say, the food got old fast. Out of all the all-inclusives I've stayed at (5 total) this was the worst. Very disappointing.Entertainment was nice. There were usually alot of guests crowded in for the entertainment...probably because that was the only thing going on in the evenings though. This resort was really quiet in the evenings. By 4:30 pm it started getting chilly out by the beach (I mean, you'd have to cover up with a towel to stay out there!) so shortly after the place was deserted and quiet. The Iberostar Dominicana is right next door (you dont even have to leave the Iberostar property) and has the disco in the evening which was alot of fun...probably the most fun thing to do in the evening. What else? UM...oh, there are no hot tubs (besides the spa that closes at 5pm I believe and you have to sign up for a time slot) so that was disappointing....referring back to the above paragraph where it starts getting chilly at 4:30. Would've been perfect heading to the hot tub! Really strange that such a big hotel and hotel chain that there wasn't a couple hot tubs.If you use a calling card to call back to the U.S. you will be charged just over a dollar for each connection so know that that will be added to your bill at the end.The Iberostars (Bavaro, Punta Cana, and Dominicana) are all connected so you can visit the other two without leaving the Iberostar property...that was a nice benefit. Some of the specialty restaurants are located in the Dominicana and Punta Cana. We ate at the Mediterrano, Gourmet and Tropical. Liked the Gourmet and Mediterrano. Wish we would've ate there more. Make your reservations for the restaurants right when you check in. The longer you wait, the more difficult (if not impossible) it will be to get in. And you HAVE TO HAVE a reservation in order to get in. Even if people dont show up for their reservation and they have room, you still can't get in. Bad system!!There is an enrty fee into the country of $10/person for Americans. You pay $10 and get a ticket, walk 6-8 steps, hand over the ticket. Just so you know and are prepared.Went on the snorkeling excursion (Caribbean Festival) through the Funjet rep. Snorkeling was ok...not Cozumel! Entertainment on the catamaran was far better! Snorkeled with nurse sharks and huge sting rays....kinda hokey because they herd 60 people or so into the pen...without flippers of course or else they couldn't fit that many in! It was neat...if you've never seen sting ray or sharks before. It was $70/person plus tax.All right, the jist of this review is this: BAD food, nice beach/pool, nice property, family-friendly, quiet resort.

<Content>Loved it! My husband and I stayed at the iberostar Bavaro from Jan 2-9th, and we had the best time. Departure from Chicago: It seemed as though the whole chartered flight was going to the Ibersotar in Punta Cana, but in reality people were going everwhere. The flight was a bit bumpy on the way in, but was happy to arrive in the open air airport. We had to wait a little bit for the luggage but then we met our apple rep and hopped on a small bus. The ride to the hotel was not as horrible as others would have you believe, there really isn't much to see. Near the end you go through a very small shopping center, think Playa del Carmen in much smaller form. There really isn't much to Punta Cana at the moment, it is literally growing and expanding now. Basically all that is there is a 25 mil streach of sand and resorts on Bavaro beach. Arrival: Very smooth and easy, our room was ready upon arrival and so we walked over there and our suitcases met us. Prior to departure we requested a room upgrade to be near the beach in the renovated section of the hotel, I also requested my travel agent to make a similar request on our behalf. It worked, and we got a great room right on the beach, and there are rows and rows of bungalows that go all the way to the hotel entrace, I can only imagine what a hike that would be from the beach if you forgot somethingRoom: Clean, spacious, and nice. No complaints expect our maid left the door open when she cleans the room and we figured out that is how all the moths get in. We had to rescue quite a few from our room.Food: Great! We got married last May in the iberostar Paraiso Lindo, and the food at Bavaro was far superior. The quality and taste were more to my liking and I felt as though the buffets had a much larger selection. I didn't care for breakfast as much, but everything else was great. We got reservations at the Steakhouse (so good, I had the sirloin, hubby had the ribs), Japanese (loved it!), Gourmet (which was wonderful, try the lobster appitizer). Service: Service in general was great, in comparison to Lindo the staff seemed a bit less friendly, but that is saying a lot because everyone was still very nice. We only had one complaint. We ate at the Steakhouse (food was really good) but we had bad service. Had to waive down the waiters to take our orders, and after asking for cafe' con leche 3 times, my husband got fed up and got it himself. He was so annoyed that he started writing down names to complain. I guess this made all the waiters so scared that they must have told management themselves, because in the end we decided not to complain as we were on vacation and didn't want anyone to lose their job because of us. The next day we were eating at the buffet near the beach for lunch, as we were waiting for the food spread, a member of the Bavaro management came up to my husband and started asking him about the previous night. We were shocked! We never complained, so that means somebody recognized us at the buffet and the management stepped in to make it up to us. He gave us an extra dinner reservation at the Jambalaya. This is just a testament to how good the service actually is, and when you think about how easily they could have dismissed us, it was really a pleasant surprise.Misc: The beach was wonderful, the sand was truly like sugar. the pool was so cold and a lot smaller than the pool at the Lindo, but that was fine with my husband and I because we are beach bums. Entertainment: We caught a few shows, and they were funny, but most of the time we would head back to the beach at night to enjoy the oceanScuba Diving: Punta Cana is not great for the novice diver. My husband did in fact get certified in Punta Cana but he had been diving before. Some newer divers were having a difficult time with the surf, but I thought it was fun. After you're down about 50ft, the surge is not bad, and you can play. Lots of stuff to see, and a large and active reef. We ended up not doing the excursions, which Dressel pushes very heavily, but we thought the trip was too long and we want to go to that side of the island for our next trip. We loved Jaron, Hecuba, Arnie and Arnavd.I would recommend this hotel to all beach lovers out to have fun. We loved it!!

<Content>First Class All the Way!!! My husband and I vacationed in Punta Cana @ Iberstar Bavaro from December 8-15. We needed to get away from our jobs, stress, etc.1) Resort: In one word...fabulous! The grounds are beautifully landscaped. The entire resort is kept immaculately clean. The Lobby is very impressive yet welcoming. The entire staff does a tremendous job! This resort is one of three Iberostar resorts on the property. Bavaro guests can use all facilities of the Punta Cana and the Dominicana.2) Suites: The suites are nicely appointed, clean and spacious. There is what I think is satellite t.v., hair dryers, and a fully stocked mini refrigerator. The suites are air conditioned and there is a ceiling fan above the bed. The bath is marble and very nice. 3) Food: Excellent and abundant!!! A magnificant buffet is served for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Bavaro also has several specialty restaurants. The specialty restaurants are simply some of the best dining in the Carribean. Guests of the Bavaro are able to dine at the other 2 Iberostar resorts. 4) Excursions: We did not do any excursions. The resort was too good to leave.5) Apple Vacations - Out of BWI; you fly USA 3000 charter flight. This was a very good and comfortable experience with in-flight movie, small meal, beverage service and helpful crew. The Apple Rep. onsite @ Bavaro does try to push the excursions, but nonetheless was very helpful and friendly. 6) Hotel Staff: EXCELLENT! The dominican people are very warm and friendly, always saying Hola. The entertainment team at this hotel included singers, show performers, and Star Friends and worked tirelessly.7) Pool: Nice and large. Kept very clean. Guests of Bavaro can also use the sister resorts' pools. Always a lot of things going on.8) Beach: The beach was gorgeous and very wide. White sand and Turquoise waters. Sand was very soft and powdery. A LOT of Palapas for shade on the beach. The ocean is clean, and the beach raked almost daily. There was a fair amount of topless women. Having traveled to the Carribean in the past, we were used to this. My husband urged me to try it for years. At 49 years old, I thought I was too old and resisted. But I finally did it and it felt great!!! I had never felt more stimulated and comfortable in my whole life. I would say about 60-70% of women of all shapes, sizes, and ages went topless when I was there . Don't be afraid to try it. You will never see any of them again anyway. And my husband loved it!!I could go on and on. Overall, FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY!!!

<Content>Beautiful resort, but would not go back My husband and I took our 4 children (ages 16-22) to the Bavaro from 12/29-1/3. I am going to start this review with the negative. I read every review I could find, we took malaria meds and had our Hep A shot. We knew not to drink the water or eat the salad. Still 4 out of 6 of us got sick. In addition, my 16 year old daughter did not lock up her jewelry in the safe and she had 2 rings and a necklace stolen from the room.Be careful with the bottled water in the rooms. We were warned that they sometimes get refilled with tap water. 2 of our bottles were not sufficiently sealed so we threw them out.We were disappointed with the water. It was extremely rough so we could not snorkel. I don't know if that is the way it always is, or if it was just a passing storm. I guess if you want to snorkel you need to stay on the Caribbean side of the island vs. the Atlantic side.Now for the positives. The resort is the most beautiful, well manicured resort we have ever been too. It reminded me of Disneyworld. We had 3 renovated rooms in the 1100 block. They were spacious, elegant and spotless. We did have a slight musty smell, but that is to be expected in a tropical locale. We ate at the Tropical restaurant, Cajun and Steakhouse. The Cajun was by far the best. We were there for New Years Eve and the buffet was fabulous. However, that is when my husband and I got sick, so we were hesitant to go back to the buffet the rest of the week.We spoke very minimal Spanish, but had no problems communicating with any of the staff. We loved the evening shows. They always had audience participation and that made for a very entertaining show.We also did an excusions with Outback Safari. After spending 4 days at the resort it was nice to leave. It was very interesting to see the rest of the island and the guides were very knowledgable and proud of their island.We really did have a wonderful trip, and the Bavaro is a gorgeous resort, however we will never go back to the Dominican Republic. We have been to many tropical islands and would rather return to one of them.

<Content>Paradise...Even with a one-year old Positives: Just returned last night from the Iberostar Bavaro and had the best vacation we have had in years. The grounds are truly beautiful, especially at night. There are peacocks and geese that run wild on the property giving the resort a luxurious but natural feel. There are also live flamingos, herons and ducks that live in the lagoons next to the main buffet restaurant. We never had a problem getting a seat next to the lagoon...It was a saving grace whenever our one-year old got fussy. We gave him some bread to toss over the rail to the birds and he stayed occupied for the duration of our meal.I have no complaints about the food at the buffet. It is better quality than I expected. I can't say enough about the waitstaff that work there either as they were over-the-top friendly and definitely enhanced the enjoyment of our trip. We also never had a problem finding a spot on the beach. By the pool, it was tougher to find a place because people do save seats by putting there belongings on there early in the day.Negatives: For people with babies: We did ask for a renovated room and a junior suite is a little bigger than a regular hotel room but not a suite like I envisioned. It's still one room with an elevated level (two stairs) for the bed. The two stairs wasn't very child freindly for a kid who is almost 2 and wants to run around. Also the marble floors were very slippery when wet especially in the bathrooms so make sure you put some towels down when you take a shower.The room was a little musty when we first got there.Restaurants - We made reservations at the Japanese and Cajun restaurants during our stay (Make your reservations early!). We were disappointed with the food quality, we had reservations for the Mediterranean restaurant but cancelled because we thought the buffet was much better and better variety. I heard the steak house is very good and it probably was since we couldn't get an early reservation there. But we were perfectly content with the buffet. Also the beach barbecue was good too at lunch. As long as you don't expect top notch gourmet meals (which we did at the specialty restaurants), you'll be okay.There is only one type of beer (el presidente), liquor (normandy liquors) and wine (some type of spanish table wine) served at the resort.Overall: The trip was more relaxing than we expected with a one-year old and the staff truly does try to cater to your every whim...It's great and I highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro.Tips: If you go down to the beach vendors (about a five minute walk down the beach), make sure you bargain. You should settle for nothing less than 50% off the first price they tell you. In some cases, you'll be able to talk them down to 75-80%. You can get souvenir t-shirts for $4 and montecristo cigars for $3. I found it pretty fun to haggle with these people. Anyone that asks you to please look in their store for a minute is a vendor and you have to bargain to get a good price. There are a few of these vendor stores on the resort. The main lobby stores are not vendor stores so you can always check there to see if you got a good deal.Ask for a renovated room...I don't know what the other rooms were like but I think it's good advice. The rooms aren't really renovated either...I would call them updated. But they are livable and didn't take away from our vacation at all. Also, the pillows are the flattest pillows I have ever slept on.One hour of free snorkeling a day at the PADI center.Go and RELAX! Enjoy and good luck.

<Content>Tennis players beware! My family consists of 4 tennis players from PA, so we thought we'd get some sunny outdoor tennis in during our vacation. Turns out that the Bavaro shares three (really 2 1/2) tennis courts with its two sister resorts. The two clay courts were nice, but the third court was a multipurpose court in disrepair. You could only reserve a court a day in advance and had to do it in person at 8 AM. So, every morning, on my vacation, I had to get up at 7, grab a cup of coffee, and go stand in line to assure some play time. The first morning I was there at 7:45 and I was about 12th in line. Now, get this.....the courts are closed from noon to 3:00! Also, many of the courts were pre-reserved for lessons. The advertised advanced 8 AM clinics never materialized.We had other problems, such as spending an hour the first night with staff getting our locks to work, and being assigned rooms next to construction. Bam, bam, bam at 8 AM.The food was OK, but for some reasons many Europeans have yet to learn about cuing at buffets.Everything else was fine and in general the place is nicely landscaped and my family liked the beaches.

<Content>Great All Inclusive for the entire family Overall we were very impressed with this resort.We were a group of 10 with ages ranging from 6 to 75 and there was something for everyone. I faxed the resort before we came requesting a newly renovated rooms and we all received them.If you are a family I highly recommend this resort, if you are a couple getting away pick an adults only resort.The Pro's-food was very good for an all inclusive (we ate lunch at the beach grill a few times but then realized how quiet and nice the buffet restaurant is for lunch)-I highly recommend the cajun and japanese-the steakhouse was okay -the resort was very clean, I was very impressed with how clean all the public bathrooms were especially by the pool area-the staff are very friendly and the maids do an excellent job (tip them everyday it will be worth it)-they had Smirnoff, Stoli, CC etc... at the bar which was good-wine at dinner was okay, the red much better than the white-lots of golf courses to choose from, rent the clubs its easier than lugging yours down, don't forget your golf shirt -the entertainment at night was good, the icebreaker games at 9pm were usually very funny-lots of great beach volleyball, the more competitive play usually does not get going until about 3pmThe Con's (nothing too major)-very few English speaking kids in the kids club-we had to have our room keys replaced 6 times as we would get back to our rooms and they would not work (very annoying)-you need to reserve chairs by the pool before 9am if you want anything half decent and the pool area can feel very crowded, by 11am there are no pool chairs left, the beach you can be a bit later-the pool bar is shaded which I'm sure is great in July and August but in January it gets a bit chilly-they needed a little bit more kid friendly food, we had chicken nuggets once but then could not find them again-they had a few mornings without bacon at the breakfast buffet-the tennis courts (3 in total)were okay but you had to get up at 7:30am to reserve one for the next day and you always want to get on court 1 or 2 as they are clay courts and dry quickly (it rained 3 or 4 times a day but only for 10 or 20 min)-make sure when you check-in you take your own bags to your room, it took them over an hour to deliver our bags -get a room on the second floor, the peacoks are always on your porch if you are on the first floor-the pillows are terrible but the beds are very comfortable-the casino is okay a little small and the tables do not open until 8pm (slots open at 4pm)-they have two ping pong tables by the pool which are always busy and very hard to get on, they are always running out of balls as well. They need to add a couple more tables, and perhaps add a sign up sheet restricting play to 15 minutes.I highly recommend this resort to families and large groups, we never had a problem getting a table for 10 at any meal. The Europeans still love to smoke, wear their banana hammocks and go topless, but that you will find that at any resort.The beach is great and so nice that you can walk on it and check out the other resorts or bargain at the huts with the locals.Thanks to everyone who posted reviews, it was the trip advisor reviews that I read in Sept. that helped me pick this resort.

<Content>Happy New Year! Just got back. It was fun. The grounds are beautifully decorated for Christmas and New Years. The New Years Eve day activies are very good and the night show was OK. But the celebration is always unforgettable if you manage to stay awake durning the show. Lots of kids this evening but the adults took charge after New Years. The Disco was going off on Thurs - Sunday then it went dead. The food was better then Beachs, Club Meds and Super Clubs. (I've been to all for New Years) The country location has a lot to do with food styles and varities. Lots of Lobster and Prawns his time of year. Each evening buffet had a different theme each day for a week. We had a party of 12 and nobody got sick. But were from LA. Endless food. The BBQ by the pool/beach for lunch was the place to be. The meat is a little fatty but delicious. But if you want more variety hit the indoor variety. The weather was perfectly balance. A little sunshine and mild humidity. Bring a small unbrella because it does rain hard for 10 minutes a couple of times durning the evening and if you don't like frizzing wet hair you might want to bring something to cover it. The water was a little ruff but it calms down a few day for snorkling off the shore. Don't forget to bring a piece of bread to feed the fish. Won't go back because we are looking for calmer surf. Stay too the Caribean side of the Island for better water.Have fun.

<Content>Great Resort This was a beautiful resort, people were very helpful. Our room was close to the Ocean and the swimming pool. We could sit on the patio and listen and see the ocean. When we went out our main door the swimming pool was right there. A perfect setting, gorgeous at night time.Food was good, never had any problems with being sick on our vacation. Went on the Safari trip, it was a blast.I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good resort for the money you spent.

<Content>I would not return I just returned last night from my Punta Cana experience and overall I was disappointed. The first thing you need to do is ask yourself, Who am I? in order to know if this resort is for you. I live in a large urban environment known for its amazing restaurants and have become a bit of a food snob. If you are at ALL a food snob, this place is not for you. Although I didn't go to PC for food, a full seven days of bad meals is a bit tough to take. Also, residents of Darfur receiving UN drops are less pushy then the guests at the buffets. They were really rude; however, the waitstaff was quite friendly considering how impolite many guests were behaving.I will say that the water and beach were very nice. Guests saved seats at the pool and beach which made it quite difficult to find a place to spend the day. I would find this to be the case as early as 8:00 am. Also, you must be able to receive a renovated room. I went to this resort because it had the highest apple rating from a tour operator. I had to change rooms midway. The second room was better, although there was an odor.Good luck to you in your trip planning.

<Content>2nd Time at Bavaro, Great as Before Just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro, this being our second time at the resort. Went with my wife and sixteen and ten year old daughters. Everybody a great time.Rooms: we requested and received two recently renovated right next to each other near the pool and our room couldn't have been better. The revonated rooms have a new bathroom, probably new furniture, new lighting, coffee maker, and iron. No mildew smell whatsoever. Short walk to the pool and beach. The TV had CNN, WGN, ESPN, ESPN 2, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Disney, and Showtime. No shortage of stations. Only drawback is lack of storage space in the drawers.Pool/Beach: Both outstanding. Never felt crowded at either place, and rarely had trobule finding a chair. Food: Very good. Always lots of food around with high quality. On New Years for dinner they had giant lobster tails, both hot and cold, shrimp, pig, etc. Everything's a high quality, and the flavor and spices are very good. Ate at the steakhouse, Japanese, Cajun, and Seafood and all were OK. Again, I can get a better steak or sushi in Chicago, but the food here was above average and defilintely was satifiying.Grounds: absolutely gorgeous. They are always spotless with perfect landscaping. With everything lit up at night, its a quite a sight to see.Entertainment: While not Broadway calliber, the shows are fun and the staff tries hard. Best shows are those with audience particiaiton where they make the contestants look like fools.Workers: best part of the trip are the people who work at the resort. They are always happy, and can't do enough for you during your stay.Only negative is the workout equipment in the gym. It definitely needs to be repleced. Had the same compliant last year, but it looks like they didn't do anything about it. All in all, a great place and would return. Any questions you can e-mail me at sross111@hotmail.com

<Content>Bravo Bavaro!! Finding a vacation spot that offers a great experience for an extended family of 17 that ranges from grandparents to grandkids and includes adults, teenagers, preteens and young children can be a daunting task. Iberostar Bavaro is the perfect place for such a vacation.We recently finished our stay their during Christmas break and found it to be a perfect family vacation for everyone. Two years ago we went on a similar vacation to Iberostar in Cancun which was outstanding. Bavaro, with it's spectacular beach, friendly staff and more manageable grounds, is even better.As all inclusive resorts go, this is as good as it gets. Never felt overly crowded, plenty of (adequate) restaurants, sports bar, disco, beach, pool, casino - really something for everyone.Please note - the CDC recommends taking medication for malaria before going to the Dominican Republic.The Iberostar Bavaro makes the medicine go down easy.

<Content>Great Resort and Great Vacation We go to an all inclusive resort in the Caribbean at least once a year. We were there the week between Christmas and New Years.Resort: The place is beautiful. All the rooms are on tree lined paths running through the property and there are peacocks everywhere. There was a lot of staff constantly cleaning and raking so the grounds are immaculate. (One day I saw the hotel general manager picking up leaves and straightening little signs as he walked down the main path!) The lobby is huge and very nice, and the bar area was fine. (Service was sometimes a little slow 鈥?it was a lot quicker just to go to the bar and get the drinks there.) The staff could not have been nicer and friendlier. Rooms: We requested a renovated room and it was very clean and neat, and just a few buildings from the beach and close to the pool. There were many more TV channels than most resorts -- not that we watched much TV but it's nice for when you're in the room. The lights over the bed were great, with built-in pinpoint reading lights. The bathrooms were spacious except for the area near the toilet 鈥?I came home with a bruise on my leg from constantly knocking into the metal toilet paper dispenser. I noticed that guests did not sit on their balconies or patios as much as at other resorts. Maybe because all the buildings are only two stories and almost all the balconies and patios face the paths that everyone uses. We didn鈥檛 notice any of the mildew and sewage smells that other reviewers have mentioned.Food: The food is fine, as long as you have realistic expectations. The buffets for all three meals were huge, with a lot of variety. Breeakfst is amazing -- anything you could possibly want. I must not have been paying attention (which is surprising because I always pay attention to food) since other reviewers have said that there is always something different 鈥?we thought that the food was almost exactly the same thing every day. There was one 鈥渟pecial鈥?entr茅e for lunch at the buffet near the pool and maybe a few different things at night, but not much else changed. At most other resorts, there is more variety from day to day. After a few days, the menu became pretty tiresome. There are sometimes lines at the stations for dinner, and New Year鈥檚 Eve was a zoo; the hotel seemed a little unprepared. We ate one night in the Steak House (complete waste of time 鈥?slow service and unimpressive food) and one night in the Japanese restaurant ( nice atmosphere, good food).Activities: We were there during an obviously busy week so we sometimes had a little trouble finding chairs on the beach, but we always did. The pool area was a little loud for our taste 鈥?after all, it was the week of school vacations so there were lots of kids. We didn鈥檛 usually do many of the organized activities, although the kids enjoyed the daily riflery and archery contests. At night, we walked to the other hotels on the property 鈥?a five minute walk. There seemed to be more activity and more people there 鈥?that鈥檚 where the casino and the disco are. (The casino was pretty funny 鈥?lots of teenage boys playing.) One of our biggest complaints was the tennis: there are only three courts for all three hotels on the property. One of us had to wake up at 7:30 to get in line to sign up for one hour of court time for the next day.One final thing: This may seem silly but it affected our vacation. When the sidewalks and the marble floors in the rooms get wet, they are VERY slippery. Two of us had major falls 鈥?one right after it rained and one in the room. Be careful.

<Content>just decent As a 13 year-old going to punta-cana with 4 of my best friends families, i had very high expectations of this trip. a year ago the same 23-person gang went to Punta Cana club and resort, which was great other than the lack of all-inclusive and the fact that the food gave everyone stomach problems. we LOVED last year soo much that we decided to go back to punta cana, to what was supposedly an even better resort. When we first got to the resort, we realized that the place was HUGE. this got annoying because there were no golfcarts for people and you had to walk everywhere. If you read that there are three iberostar resorts in punta cana, it really is one big resort divided into three sections (bavaro,puntacana,dominicana)The accomodations are decent, but if you can, upgrade to a renovated room because the bathrooms are 100% nicer, cleaner, and better.The food is also just ok, but at least it didnt make us sick to our stomach. The japanese restaurant was the best, and the steak-house was also very good, but the buffet was not that great.The night-life is what really killed it for me and my buds. There is soemthing for little little kids, and something for 16 and over(which i will get to later), but if you were stuck in the 10-15 year old range like we were, you really had to improvise. Our parents had a blast every night, thoughThe system at Bavaro is red and orange wristbands, orange for 16+ and red for anything under. The orange wristbands were pretty much only if you wanted to get into the nightclub(which is an airplane styled club that is actually really fun) [and yes i got in], but are obtainable for the younger teens. I got an orange by slipping a 5 to the guy at the counter (hah) but it worked for me and my friends.The beach is great, and the water (ocean) activities are awesome, only the banana boat (look it up if you dont know what it is) is 10 dollars a time, and to do any of the activites, you have to fill out a huge liability form. the snorkeling is also awesome and you dont have to go out very far to see marlins, blue fish, rockfish etc. we also did see some stingrays but they are easily avoidable.OTHER THINGS TO KNOW*alcohol and tobacco are easily obtainable for kids/teens, wether its down the beach at the sort of flea-market or at the resorts bar where they dont really check for age*the puntacana resort has better stage entertainment so take the five minute walk to their stage*there is so much free stuff at this resort, but dont think that money isnt really needed, since youll probably spend a huge amountoverall this was an okay trip, and we wont be going back, but had a great time. It didnt come close to the fun we had at Punta Cana Club and Resort, but nevertheless it was fun.

<Content>Best family Vacation Yet We are a family of 17- grandparents, teenagers, adults, and little kids. There was something to do for everyone, day and night. Between the beautiful pool area and gorgeous beach and weather, the days flew by way too fast. Everything is convenintly located- restaurants, lobby, pool, amazing rooms, etc. The property is beautiful and well maintained with roaming peacocks, flamingos, and ducks. The food is pretty good, always something for everybody. You couldn't ask for a friendlier staff who could be more accommodating. Only weakness is the gym. There is always family oriented entertainment in the evening and a casino for later at night. We were there during Christmas week and chairs are plentiful both on the beach and at the pool, which we thought was a novelty.

<Content>Gorgeous Beach, Wonderful People Our adult family just spent 9 days at the Iberostar Bavaro and it was relaxing and wonderful!First, let me say that with the exception of the concierge staff (Kathy and Taiva were useless and rude--irony since they are guest services) the people who worked at this hotel were friendly and really fantastic people. Even without tipping they had smiles on their face and helped to accomodate what you needed--especially the wait staff. But this is a poor country, and small tips really do help people. The beach has white sand that feels like flour..and is cleaned every day by the staff to remove any seaweed. The water was crystal clear and we could snorkel on our own beach and see many different types of fish near an old coral reef. You can also take long walks on the beach because it is very extensive. The rooms are like little condos--everything is a junior suite here which makes it nice to have a bedroom and a sitting area. The one problem was that often you would get a sewage smell outside the rooms, this was at a lot of different rooms---not sure why, but it would be good if they could address this.The food was delicious. The general buffet has an enormous breakfast selection---freshly made croissants, waffles, pancakes, french toast, different types of sausages, eggs made to order, dominican breakfast food, cereals, delicious tropical fruits, and freshly squeezed juices--not to mention freshly made hot chocolate and fantastic coffee. We were fortunate to be there over Christmas and had an extravagant lobster, prawn, steak, lamb, dinner. The lobster tails themselves were huge! and the desserts were delectable. We drank the bottled water in the minibar (all included) and alcoholic drinks as well as the water at the restaurants and none of us got sick. The roaming peacocks, the flamingos and ducks and geese all make the experience even more tropical and delightful. General DR issues--highly dominated by Europeans which means lots of smoking (!!!) and lots of topless women (all ages...) and men in speedos. Makes the beach interesting!We highly recommend a visit to the DR---and to the Iberostar Bavaro.

<Content>wonderful place for families The previous reviews go into alot of detail so I will not be that long. The Hotel as pple have said before is beautiful. I would suggest to fax or send an email requesting a renovated room and near the pool. They do try and honor the requests. The resort is big if you stay near the dominicana but if you are around the pool , the beach is only steps from the pool. There were lots of palapas and chairs so there was no need to reserve a chair.The weather was great just bring some bug spray for the night.The buffet and other restaurants except for the steakhouse are around the lobby. The food was great..Nobody got sick and while I was there they even had health inspectors examining the food. everything was top notch! The gourmet and the japanese were the best restaurants. The mediteranean was ok nothing to write home about. The best thing is that they have 6:30pm sittings so we took our 3 year old daughter to these restaurants and they were very accomodating. they have a kids menu at each one. The pool was great for kids..the kids pool was really small but because there are no steps into the big pool the kids easily swam around in it. At night they had a minidisco at 7:30-8pm which was great for the kids. the girls who run the kids club sing and dance with the kids on the theatre stage and they have a ball.as for shopping..don't buy anything but coffee and vanilla in the supermarket just 5 min. down the beach there is a big market where you can get everything for half of the price..All I can say is that we had a wonderful time and we will definitely go back. we have been to other resorts in Punta cana and this one was the best.

<Content>Fantastic vacation! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 12/2-12/9/2006 and we had one of our best vacations there! This was our first time staying in an all-inclusive, but we've gone on many trips to Florida, Aruba, St. Maarten, Puerto Rico, Cancun, staying mostly in 5-star timeshare resorts, and we've also gone on a Royal Caribbean cruise of the eastern Caribbean islands. I had read many of the reviews (both positive and negative) just before we left on our trip so I was somewhat preparing myself for some of the more negative things that I had read about, like the odor in the rooms, lack of iron in the room, the unsafe drinking water, the potentially poor service from the staff, etc... I went with an open mind, but glad that I was mentally 'prepared' for some negatives, so packed some additional items in case I needed them, like room deodorizers, dryer softener sheets in my suitcase, travel iron, etc. Luckily, I didn't need any of them.When we arrived, the lobby and grounds of the resort were absolutely gorgeous! We arrived around 5:00pm. Check-in was quick. We asked at the desk about getting a refurbished room, but they were all out. They asked us to check with the desk in the morning and they will set one aside if one opened up. The older room we had did have the smell of cleaning solution when we first walked in and later when that smell wore off, we could smell a mild musty odor, but I'm not sure I would really have noticed or paid much attention to it had I not read about all the complaints from the negative reviews. I didn't have to use any of the room deodorizers that I had brought. There was an iron and ironing board in the room even though some reviews indicated there weren't any (probably older reviews). In the end, they did give us a refurbished room the next morning...It was actually, a very newly refurbished room that was just turned over to them as we were the first ones to use it! It was a very beautiful room. The main differences between the old and refurbished room was a change in the layout of the bathroom and of course the newer marble tiles and materials in the bathroom and room. Our refurbished room was just around the corner from the pool so it was an easy walk to the pool and beach! The A/C in both rooms worked really well and there was no additional charge for using the room safe in either room...just remember to ask at the check-in counter for the key you'll need in order to be able to change the code on the safe. The TV remote was in the room(s) already so you do not have to ask for one at the desk.We found the resort staff to be extremely friendly, helpful, hardworking, and genuinely kind. They responded to every request in a timely and friendly manner. We befriended a number of the wait staff in the main dining area and at the pool/beach area...so much so, that my boyfriend was invited by one of the waiters to play pool with them in the staff recreation area between lunch and dinner. He played pool and hung out with some of them on two afternoons while I did other activities or lounged by the pool and beach. We exchanged phone #s and addresses with one of the waiters and hope to keep in touch with him! The waiters/waitresses we spoke to work something like 12 or 14 (I forget) days straight from like 6:00 or 7:00am to 11:00pm or later with a few hours off during the day, then have 3 days off. Many don't live nearby so actually live in staff housing on site then go home for the 3 days...to be with their family. Most enjoy their jobs and know they do have to do a good job and work hard or else they are out of a job! The entertainment staff were also very friendly and were so full of energy! I'm amazed at how much work they do and how long their workdays are, not only the entertainment staff, but the other staff as well!! Some of the shows at night were a little corny, but I give them all an A+ for their energy, ability to get people to participate, and to connect with everyone they interacted with.The food at the buffet was GREAT! We ate at the Japanese and Mediterranean restaurants and thought those were very good also. We went to lobster night at the buffet on Wednesday...I would caution you not to go during 'peak' dining time! I think we were there around 7:00 and the place was mobbed!! There were long lines at all 3 lobster stations and even though we had no problems getting a table, the dining area was noisier and more crowded than usual. The buffet area was REALLY hot that night with the 3 lobster grilling stations going at max output and the large number of people in the area! I would've made reservations at one of the restaurants had I known it was going to be so busy or gone earlier or later than we did.The beach was FABULOUS. Staff raked the seawoods from the sand every morning. They also went around and picked up any trash (i.e. straws and cig butts) and roots from the palm trees off the sand using their hands (not rakes as it would not be rake-able). We had no problems with getting chairs either under the shade or in the sun without having to be there at 7:00 in the morning. The sand is very clean and soft and the water was crystal clear with some waves. We didn't spend as much time at the pool...but that was also very nice and clean when we did.I used bottle water for drinking and for brushing my teeth the first 2-3 days I was there. My boyfriend was fine with using the tapwater so I stopped using strictly the bottled water on our second or third day. Neither of us got sick (for that reason anyway) during the entire trip.Yes, the areas outside of the resorts are not very nice because they are a poor country. We actually have a friend at home that grew up in a city about 45 minutes drive outside of the resort so went to visit her family, whom we never met,...and yes, they are very poor. The house shares a water pump with the house next door, but the pump was broken, so they had no running water....i.e. no water for flushing the toilet. They have to buy water from a truck daily until they can get the pump fixed. The electricity went out while we were there during a brief rainstorm and they use a car battery as a backup to light the single lightbulb in the 'living room' and whatever other appliances they may need to use. But they are still a proud and content people mostly....They manage with what they have. There were children begging and wanting to shine our shoes (even my leather sandals!) and this was sad to see. And if we were not with some locals while in town, I would feel somewhat unsafe in some areas outside of the resort, as we stand out as obvious tourists. You have to be open minded when travelling outside of your comfort zone and to a foreign country. Money is hard to come by and there is little goverment assistance (if any), no retirement support or funds, no government assisted healthcare, etc... There is no income or property tax, so that's one reason why goods are so expensive to purchase. They have something like a 16% sales tax. According to the tour guy we had on one of the excursions, companies (like the resorts) don't have to pay any taxes to the government and basically, keep whatever is made from the business. It definately made me appreciate what we have here in the States and also appreciate the people, esp the staff at the resort, that they can still honestly say they are happy with what they have...and feel fortunate to have the job that they have at the resort.I thoroughly enjoyed everything in the resort and appreciated the things I did see and experience outside of resort. It was a good experience. I can go on an on about all the great things at this resort, but all in all, we had a wonderful time at the IBB and we will definately come back! Some friends of ours are interested in going next year and if they do, it is likely we will join them on the trip!!

<Content>Great choice...very happy Hola... Just got back from our trip to Punta Cana, Iberostar Bavaro. We visited from December 10-17, 2006. This review is pretty lengthly and hope it will help someone. First I would like to disclose that I am a travel agent and was chose to stay at Iberostar Bavaro because they are in my opinion very consistent. booked this through TNT vacations. I was there to view a bunch of hotels and enjoy the resort while I was there. This resort is beautiful. But best of all was the staff! from reception, wait staff, bartenders, housekeeping,  most of all star friends. We started off by tipping about $1-$2 and received such amazing service by the 3rd day pretty much were giving $3-$5... Dominicans are such warm, family orientated people. I saw more employees talking w/ little kids, touching their hair, cutting their food. I have never been to a caribbean island that had so many different travelers. I was surprised to see there was not a large amount of americans but mostly europeans.There was alot of a mexican inspiration in the architecture  mainly the language. Reception, wait staff, star friends, etc.. spoke quite a bit of english. was not able to communicate very well w/ security, housekeeping, landscapers.Power outages in Punta Cana are pretty frequent there. There was about 5 times we lost power for about :3-:5 min. There was a time for about :20min that we lost power at about 6:15pm. I was in the room alone(husband was at the gym), and had just gotten out of the shower. It was so dark you could not see your hand in front of your face. I would recommend to bring along one of those little flashlights that can fit on your key chain.AIR- we took a charter on North American from Boston direct to Punta Cana. Although a charter is convenient because there are no stops the seats the leg room is very tights and seats seemed to be smaller than the norm. Was pleasantly surprised to see that they served food.. they also included pillows  blankets. They had a movie that was shown and they had headsets for $4. You could bring your own, but note that the plug is a double not a single. We arrived about :30min early and landed in Punta Cana. As others have mentioned it may be a good idea to have a pair of shorts handy in your carry on so that you can change on the plane. When we travel I always carry a small carry on to put by our feet w/ things for the plane for entertainment. About a 20 to carry on with our toiletries (liquids seperate) with a couple changes of clothes/ bathing suits for each of us, then one or two checked bags with half of everyones stuff in each bag incase one gets lost or misdirected.PUJ AIRPORT- upon arrival they take your picture. If your airline has not already included a tourist card ($10pp) you will need to go the desk in the center before you get into the line for immigration to purchase it. Once you get the tourist card, get into line at the Immigration., then collect your bags and pass through customs. Right at customs, this is where it may get a little confusing. The porters there are trying to make a living, however they do look at your luggage tags and if your tags say TNT they will yell TNT to you thinking you are supposed to go with them. You can use them, or wheel your own. Once you exit customs there is a reception are of desks and people set up with sign that will say apple, tnt etc. they will direct you to a bus. There are a couple of vendors out in the parking lot selling beer, cold drinks, etc that you can bring on the bus.TRANSFERS-Bus ride for us was about :30min. Nice bus, went by very quickly. HOTEL- Very happy with the hotel, if you book through a company such as tnt, apple, etc. I was told that the safe charge is included. If you do not I was told there was a daily charge for the safe. I don't know this for a fact, but thought it was about $7/day. The property is very large! The landscaping is very beautiful with alot of water ponds with flamingo, birds, ducks, fish. Everywhere you looked someone was pruning trees, or picking up leaves, replanting, etc.ROOMS- The buildings are set up 2 stories high. I believe there are only 44 oceanview/front rooms. The rest @ 540 are situated around the property. They are doing a major remodel as others have reported. I was surprised to see the buildings were completely gutted.. no windows, doors, etc. In the newer units bathrooms the have a large tiled stand up shower w/ glass doors, toilet, single sink with quite a bit of vanity space, and a tub. Although the rooms are beautiful the bathroom set up could be awkard for families that are trying to shower and get ready at the same time with the clear glass in the shower. All rooms have refrigerators stocked with bottled water, coke, diet coke, sprite, beer..... DRINKS- the bartenders were FABULOUS!! fantastic service. Raffeal was much fun.... was a little surprised to see that IB. Bavaro did not have much top shelf of much at all. Their local brand of liquors is Normandy..some was okay, but thought most was pretty bland.... Some other resorts had more top shelf liquor. Their are so many wonderful concotions that they come up with we were very pleased. Their local beer is Presidente and we enjoyed that very much too.FOOD- if you are staying for 7 days you can reserve 3 specialty restaurants. The amount of reservations you can make vary based on your length of stay. We were told that if you take a reservation that someone cancelled it would not count to your amount you are allowed. Long pants were required in all restaurants other than the buffet. We dined in:Steakhouse- was fabulous.. awesome rib eyes...great service!Mexican- the appetizer buffet was better than the entree, but again very good.Japanese- food was okay... service was VERY slow. (I think they forgot about us) people that arrived 1/2 hr after us had their entree and they hadn't taken our order yet. Had better food at the buffet where they make fajitas made to order.Main Buffet- what a suprise that was! Very good! Huge assortment, something for everyone. Breakfast is served daily until 10am. Dinner nightly and very good..they changed it up quite a bit with fajitias made to order, and pasta station made to order, etc.... Lunch was okay (only ate here once because this is located up by the lobby and quite a hike from the beach/pool.Secondary Buffet- located by the pool/beach. Offers continental breakfast from 10am to about noon. Lunch was very good!! ALOT to choose from... rotisirie (can't spell) chicken, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, fish, french fries, pizza, nachos, roll up sandwiches, salad bar, sirloin, plus a grill some days that had more seafood  kabobs.. veggies... And that doesn't include all the fresh fruit, desserts, ice cream machine, and ice cream stand that right there!! yummy... this buffet closed around 4pm, but they left out nacho's and some food i think until about 6pm. Didn't eat at the other restaurants so I don't have a review for that.POOL- nice  large, however were a little dissappointed with the swim up bar being completely in the shade so the water was cold and you didnt want to hang out much there. Also, they did not have pool floats. Although they did sell some blow up floats in their store and people used them in the pool. BEACH- beautiful.. sand, beautiful water.....nice little surf to play in. Some people bought at the IB store some toys such as pails, floats, rings to play with on the beach/ocean. It is a pretty busy beach because standing at the beach to your right is a shopping area that you can walk to. (we referred to it as the Punta Cana walmart) they sold the usual tshirt, wood stuff, jewelry, paintings, etc. To the left is the Iberostar Domincana, Iberostar Punta Cana, and the 5 Riu's. You can walk up to any of the resorts to check them out. although I would not try to get anything to drink./eat, etc. Everyday a photographer and an animal handler come down the beach (usually about noon) and they alternated between an iguana, parrots, snake..yuck.. but my favorite was a little tiny monkey named tete.... he would sit in your hands or ontop of your head and they would take some pics... they would say tete..no pee pee... because sometimes he would pee is someones hands.... too funny.. then that night they pics were by the lobby for purchase. $8 U.S. Topless is everywhere on the beach... in fact at times there were more topless than anything. Alot of women walking down the beach topless and quite a bit of thongs, g stings with both men  women.... LAUNDRY- Had I realized how inexpensive it was I would've packed alot less and had things like pants, tops cleaned. I grabbed a price list and it is listed in Pesos, so if I did the conversion incorrectly please let me know.. exchange rate is about 31 pesos to 1 us dollar. Please don't quote me exactly on them...Women- top 40 pesos $1.30skirt 50 pesos $1.61short 25 pesos $ .80pants 50 pesos $1.61Men-top 40 pesos $1.30tshirt 30 pesos $ .96short 25 pesos $ .80pants 50pesos $1.61SPA- did not use it, but heard quite a bit that did... alot of feedback said massages were very nice, but not as professional as home.25 min massage $25-$3055 min massage $50-$80manicure reg. $15, french $18pedicure reg. $20, french $23facials 60 min. $50, 90 min $75-$90They also offered packages, haircuts, body treatments, etc.I was saving the absolute best for last.... that is the star friends. These folks go above  beyond and cannot say enough about their personalities! They are like playmakers that get games/tournaments started... We played a bunch of activities... bocce ball, darts, air rifle (target shooting), beer drinking contest (much fun!). My husband got roped into playing a game which he thought was a beer drinking contest but turned out to be a mr sexy contest... I don't think i've laughed that hard in a long time! they played that song I'm to sexy for this shirt.. did I mention it was during the day and all the guys were in their bathing suits so they didn't have tops on..?? they had to dance for the judges some booty shaking, grinding, and pour water over themselves.. like I said..much fun! They had water  beach volleyball, water polo, archery, ping pong, bingo, water games, horse shoes, plus many other games they would come up with.. We had alot more fun when we would participate, plus was a great way to get to meet others.NIGHTTIME- entertainment was very entertaining... they would do something called ice breaker which was audience participation to break the ice....alot of fun..... and many laughs... entertainment usually went from about 9:00pm-11pm... They did have a night club  casino next door... we visited both. Nightclub was a little on the quiet side (I think all the fun in the sun  drinking most people tend to turn in by midnight)..casino was very smokey and did not see anyone really winning...good for entertainment though. Outstanding memorable starfriends were: Houke, Oliver, Super Eli,  Ray...Departure at PUJ airport- I am very embarrased to say we almost missed our flight home! between me being a travel agent and my husband works for the FAA it turned to be quite embarrassing!!! And I am mentioning this incase it will help someone else!! Upon arrival at PUJ we got our boarding passes, went through immigration,  security. Since it was Sunday my husband wanted to watch the football game it was 2pm. There is a bar beside the Wendys at the airport which serves drinks  has tv's. So while he was there I went over to our gate to find out what time our flight was boarding. I was told they were boarding at 4pm. So I went back and told him that. At 3:25, I said we should head on over to the gate just as a opened the door I heard the overhead paging us to the gate. We went running over to our gate and everyone was gone. They started boarding at 3pm and everyone was on the plane waiting for us and two other people. The flight attendant asked us about the confusion because I guess they had to page others and I told her ,they told us 4pm boarding.. others on the plane spoke up and said they were told the same thing.... so beware... if everyone is checked in, and the plane is loaded they will depart eearly. (we left :45 min earlier than scheduled). After the fact we realized that the bar did not have any speakers inside so you could not hear any information. There was a family in there that missed their earlier flight into Fort Lauderdale and we didn't realize why... now we know...Everything worked out fine, just beware!Iberostar Bavaro is a beautiful, large resort that has a great layout, most friendly staff I have encountered anywhere, fabulous food, good drinks, fun activities.... I highly recommend this property!!!!! Hope you all enjoy it as much as we did...

<Content>I would not return to the Domincan Republic I read all the reviews before we left and most of them sounded O.K. We usually travel to the Southern Caribbean and after this trip I will continue to visit the Southern Caribbean Islands. I new from the begining that the price to go to D.R was very afforable since it was all Inclusive.. Well you get what you pay for!! It just seems to me that the people didn't care if you were happy or not.. I also became sick after the third day there. Place was very clean and they were always cleaning and maintaining the grounds. place was beautiful .. just was to large .Another thing that really made us mad was that our room was never cleaned until after 4pm . I never stayed at a hotel where the maid cleaned the room so late. We gave her tips and hoped that she understood what we wanted but it was very difficult to communicate. Our friends that were with us called the front desk twice with the same problem but nothing was done about it. . I guess the place really wasn't for us. We ended up checking out a day earlier that planned.. I just wanted to go Home.. I was to sick to stay any longer.

<Content>Great Vacation-Iberostar is great! Room: We had a renovated room with a king size bed. The room was lovely, and very clean. The bathroom was also good size, clean....the hairdryer worked intermittently. The maid kept the mini-bar well stocked and the room was very clean.Food: The food in the restaurants that you could make reservations at was much better than the restaurant buffet. The gourmet restaurant LaCouple and the jambalya restaurant were very good. The Steakhouse was just ok. The buffets were good, but got very repetitive. Virtually the same food choices every night, but really there was something for everyone. Even though they said you can drink the water at the restaurants, I would recommend that you do not....my friend did and I didn't. She got sick....I didn't!Drinks: Unlimited drinks are provided. They seemed to be unusually sweet, but they had a good selection. At the pool...they do not serve you drinks...you have to go to the bar (there are two at the pool) to get them.Pool: Good size, plenty of chairs, nice swim up bar, and lots of activities. The pool near the swim up bar could have been kept up more regularly. It was a little dirty.Beach: Beach was well kept and plenty of chairs. Topless sunbathing is allowed, and there are alot of Europeans at this resort so it took some getting used to.

<Content>Nothing spectacular This was my first time in the DR and my first time doing an all inclusive in years. First let me say I had a renovated room right near the lobby and the room was great. My advise, request a renovated room PRIOR to yoru departure. The hotel grounds were beautiful, the beach was clean and the staff was very very helpful.....As for the food....you will get sick of it after a while. I was there for 5 nights. The Gourmet restuarant was far from gourmet...but the food was tolerable/average. No one I traveled with got sick. If you want more action, then I would stay at the Domicana. Thats where the casino is and its pretty lively there at night. The bavaro is pretty dead. We went to the small casino every night and had a good time. The drinks were pretty terrible. Only 1 beer to choose from and sometimes when I ordered a frozen drink it came w/ ice. But what do you expect for the price i paid for this trip through apple vacation? The trip from airport to hotel was terrible, way over an hour on bumpy roads. Listen, for the price it was a really nice vacation. Would I go back? No but that doesnt mean I wouldnt recommend it for someone looking for a nice relaxing cheap vacation as long as you dont care about fine dining.

<Content>Pampered by everyone-Fantastic food! We had an absolutely wonderful time! The employees were great! We have never been pampered at a resort like this. The Buffet was wonderful and all the other restaurants were wonderful. The Carribean is beautiful on this side of the D.R. We will be back year after year! Our stay... 12/4/2006 - 12/11/2006

<Content>Great Place - Few Bits of Advice We had a great time here. I won't repeat much of what has been said in other reviews, but will add a few pieces of advice.Send the hotel an email prior to your trip specifying what sort of room you want. I did not do this since every other all-inclusive resort I have been to determines your room at the time you are checking in. I always have been able to specify in person. THis resort had rooms already assigned with most paperwork alread y done. I was travelling with my parents so needed to make changes so that we could be located together. We got a great location but not a renovated room. While the room was good, it wasn't great. Things kept breaking (although they would fix them promptly), the bed wasn't in the best shape, and the bathtub/shower combo had an inadequate curtain so you had to be careful not to flood the room.Food was great. They did a wonderful job on the buffet. I loved the Mediterranean restaurant.I did find a marked difference at the other 2 sister resorts. They were more crowded, lines at the bars, drinks were smaller. I was glad to be at the Bavaro.Casino rules are a little different than Las Vegas, but I still enjoyed it. Maybe because I actually won a few dollars! $5 minimums on blackjack.We are scuba divers and were not overly impressed by thge Dive Shop on site or the diving. The big, comfortable dive boat was broken for most our stay so we went out in smaller, cramped boats which also had some technical difficulties. The dive sites were OK, but I am probably spoiled a bit from diving in Cozumel. The said the best diving is on the other side of the island which involves a 1 1/2 hour bus ride. Not for me!On the last day we were there we did go snorkeling off the beach and thought it was as much fun as the diving. We took bread rolls out for the fish and saw quite a variety.

<Content>Oh so wonderful!! We stayed at the IBB the last week of November. It is our third Iberostar and we enjoyed it the most even though the weather was windy and we had some rain. The property is beautiful - beach is truly amazing. In spite of the weather the ocean was warm and even clear at times. We had fun boogy boarding in the waves.We had a renovated room in a block near the pool as we had requested. It was very nicely done and had a nice amount of space for our family of four. No musty smell like at the IBHD. One thing to note is there is no need to bring plug adapters as they have installed plugs that work for both American and Carribean style plugs. The maid service was great and we only had one day where it was late in the day. We always had plenty to drink in our fridge. There is a coffee maker and an iron in each room. the beds were comfortable and they gave us plenty of pillows to make up for their 'flatness'.The resort staff were very accomadating and friendly. We found the food good with plenty of variety. Another nice addition we noted at this property is that while the buffet eating area is outside, the serving/kitchen area is airconditioned behind an automatic sliding door. The specialty restaurants were good and all very well airconditioned. We particularly enjoyed the Jambalaya. We went to the Punta Cana/Dominicana side for 1 meal and a walk around and there was a big difference. No AC in the specialty restaurant and the property was huge with not as good food/ service/ amenities. One spot we enjoyed everyday was the beach bar - Basilio makes the most awesome fries and grilled ham and cheese! Our kids (3 1/2 and 8) enjoyed the Kids Club. the staff, Kaila and Belle were wonderful. There is no actual kids club building (I think it is being renovated), they meet at a conference room but they had a printed schedule and we could always find them when my kids wanted to participate.Thje poool is nice and while not as large as the IB Maya it has a nice 0 grade entry for the little ones and is neatly divided into 3 seperate areas - the shallow, the bar (over a step bridge) and the deep adult/activity area. You can access all 3 areas without leaving the water but you are not mixed up with the kids when you are having a poolside cocktail.While the propery is spread out it never felt crowded. there was always a chair and a palapa.available. My one complaint is that there is actually an abundance of shade - especially poolside!We really liked that there was a good mix of ages and nationalies. We always go the same week of the year and there were a few more Americans with kids this year which was nice in a way.This trip we actually left the property - first for deep sea fishing. caught 6 total - big Mahi mahi and a shark. We booked online and paid for 4 hours on a shared boat - quite reasonable. Beware though, they tell you it can be rough and I was seasick for the first time in my life!The second excursion was to the DonLucas cigar factory. They pick you up at the hotel and give a very interesting tour even for non-cigar smokers. The concierge will help arrange a time.My husband bought some and is enjoying them quite a bit. They are really developing the area and there was quite a bit of shopping especially the area around where our fishing boat left (near Captain Cooks). It was fun to walk around and I never felt unsafe.There were no bugs and we didn't get any mosquito bites - maybe the wind kept them away. Overall we were very happy with this property and are planning to go back for our annual family excursion. If you want a nice, relaxed warm vacation this is your spot.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro ~ Amazing Resort, Abssolute Paradise! My husband and I went to this resort for our honeymoon. Well, I didn't want to ever leave! This was the most romantic, beautiful place I've ever been. From the flamingo's and peacocks walking around, to lovely gardens and flowers, this was heaven. They had the most gourmet restaurants and food We'd ever experienced. The staff were so polite and friendly we enjoyed every minute of this holiday. All the restaurants were incredible, and our favourite was the French one. The buffet was equally as good as the specialty restaurants, and had so much food it was hard to walk away from! You could get really large on this holiday with all the amazing food! At the pool there is a health bar, fresh fruit blended into a cool drink. I definately recomend having a few of those a day! So refreshing. There is so much to do here you could stay for weeks. Games going on all the time, the staff keep you going with all kinds of activities so there is always something to do if you don't want to just lay on the beach. The entertainment at night....well, nothing less than amazing. We went to the show every night, and they have some incredible dancers and singers here. It was so much fun, and very entertaining. Totally worth going to. And the drinks at this resort were always amazing! I can't even begin to tell you how much we loved the Iberostar! I've heard that they are highly recomended, and I 100% agree. This was such a fantastic honeymoon for us I definately want to go back. If you are used to first class, this is the place to be~If you have any questions or concerns let me know. This resort is all it's said to be and more... star_doc@hotmail.com

<Content>Loved the BAVARO We just arrived from our trip and want to go back! We have to stay this is one of the best beach vacations we've had and we've had quite a few. Our room was clean and spacious, the food was above average, the property is very well maintained and the staff was wonderful.We would definitely recommend this place! If we have to add a few suggestions: the checkin staff gave us a room next to a building being renovated without realizing it. We had to get transferred to another room which they did immediately. Also, the checkin staff should have access to more staff as the lines get longer. A few times we saw 1 staff member handling a line of more than 10 people. Also, the gym equipment could be upgraded.They might want to add some signs to avoid any liabilities due to walking barefoot. if there was any signs,I did not see them!Otherwise, everything else was wonderful and we would definitely stay at an Iberostar Resort again! P.S. We walked to the Riu Taino next door and were so happy that we stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro - what a big difference!!!

<Content>Great Vacation !!! Our stay at the Bavaro was the week of 11-04-06 thru 11-12-06.This is my first review and I am only writing it because the reviews we read before the trip were so helpful / informative.When I read negative reviews about this resort I wonder if these guys were staying at the same place we did or are they just impossible to please. To begin the Bavaro is in the Dominican Republic not New York or Paris so to compare a 5 star there to here would be unfair. The resort was very clean. The service , except for the beach area, was outstanding. The entire staff was outgoing and freindly.Not once did we not receive something we requested. We found the food selection and quality was very good to great at every location we tried. If you are active the pool area is for you , if relaxation is what you are looking for the beach area is outstanding !!! Simply put there is something or some place at Bavaro for everyone to enjoy.Just go have fun and relax !!!

<Content>Near Death Experience If you are looking for a relaxing holiday this is not the place to go- the hotel complex is massive but remains over crowded. The buffet style restaurants were basic and the food was repeatitive throughout our two week stay. We had booked this holiday in order to get married and have a honeymoon, however due to severly bad food poisoning (resulting in a 3 day stay in hospital) our wedding had to be cancelled and re-arranged to suit the hotel and not ourselves!!!If you still decide to go.....or have already booked, be aware of what you eat, considerate of how long it has sat, and rest assured that the on-site doctor and hospital staff are excellent.

<Content>No bravo for Bavaro My husband and I stayed here for the week of Thanksgiving with friends. We have traveled many times to Mexico and Jamiaca. We have had much better experiences there.I will try to be a simple as I can.DR: Like any other island. Iberostar: Really disapointed me. I have been to others, and they were so nice. This one was awful.Beach: Great. This is the one shining spot for this resort. Lots of huts, good sand and surf. Green waters. Water was warm.Pool: Only one, lots of kids crowding it up. Closes at 7. Water temp. was ok.Restaurants: The Cajun was great. All the others so, so. Buffets NEVER changed, same stuff every day. Got really boring. Not a lot of selection.Service: Worst service I have ever had in my life. For what you pay for the resort, the least they could do was make sure that your glasses are filled. Many times we had to fill our own glasses. Also, even though we are in their country, it would be nice if the resort had people that understood more stuff, like Coca-Cola. Sometimes instead of Coke I got O.J. or whatever (that's when they actually got our drinks!).Bars: Not good. Drinks weren't good, alcohol was cheap. Service here was awful too. Seems that the wait staff could care less if you get a drink, or get what you order. They want the Americans to tip, I heard that tipping is strictly an American thing, but they don't want to do anything to get it.Entertainment: The worst I have ever seen. Put me to sleep. I tried it every night, and it was never any good.Check in/out: Very good. No problems.Room: OK. Cleaning was great.Flight: TAKE A CHARTER! We did and had a much shorter trip then those who didn't. Great service and flight on USA 3000.Excursions: Friends did the safari with Apple. Said it was great. We did the snorkeling with Marinarium (spelling???) it was awful. Snorkeling wasn't any good, and if you do go and they tell you you do not need fins, they are lying!!! Unless you are part dolphin. Mostly was just a party boat ride. Not worth my money. Bus ride: Ok.Other: Don't drink the water. Our Apple rep. told us this when we got there, I think that it was wise. It stays pretty warm there all year long, so keep that in mind. Lots of construction/remodeling being done. Casino was tiny. Internet was a long hike away. Spa was good. Must make reservations to use the jacuzzis!!! Would not go back.

<Content>Awesome honeymoon My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon November 13-20th. I must say that I read several reviews before I left and I have decided that there are people out there that no matter the service they will never be satisfied. The rooms were clean, nice and roomy. The food was out of this world. We ate at 6 different resturants during out stay and they were amazing. The buffet had plenty to choose from and I am a very picky eater! We tipped our maid the first day and did not want for anything the entire week. The service was excellant and the people were extremely polite. Yes, there was a walk to the beach and the pool but our theme for the week was to mosey and we just enjoyed every second. We would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>so so experience The beach is very nice however the water is fairly wavy due to atlantic not carribean. Our room was very musty to the point that if we were not leaving we would have anyway. The walkways are painted concrete and very slippery when wet. The food was pretty good and the fine dining at le coupele was also reasonably good.The overall vibe was just not right, there is lots of booze but not much interesting to ask for and the bartenders were not much help. No blenders to create fresh fruit drinks, no mojitos just the usual prefab pina colada etc. The swim up bar was not very accessible and was shaded so you sat in fairly cool pool water in shade.The nightly entertainment was quite good and the kids club people were nice but the activities were fairly limited due to a wide age range for one club.If you go, try to stay on the side of the hotel away from construction so you can get to pool and lobby area without a confusing and diverting walk.

<Content>Good bargain, but not a 4 star resort We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro last winter. I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a cheap vacation at an all-inclusive, this is definitely a bargain. But whoever gave this place a 4-star rating never entered one of the rooms, or tried to get a drink (or chair, for that matter) on the beach. Other reviewers have complained but we thought the food was fine (we're not all that picky) and the attitude was pretty standard for the Caribbean. However, this is not the place for everyone (we're planning a trip again this winter and will not be staying at this resort). In a nutshell:1. Huge resort: you will have a long walk to pool, food or beach (or possibly all three).2. Rooms are clean but otherwise Motel 6 circa 1970.3. Grounds, pool and beach are beautiful.4. Forget about getting any kind of beach or poolside service.5. Beach is very crowded; chairs are hard to come by and trying to find friends/family out there is like looking for a needle in a haystack.There were 8 of us total, including a 3 year old and a 10-month old, and the size of the resort was a killer for us. Iberostar Bavaro is one of three hotels at the resort (considered the nicest: you have access to the other two but they don't have access to yours). But even just staying at our hotel, everything was a haul: the beach, the pool, and particularly the main dining area. Not the end of the world, but with little kids, trips back to the room are plentiful and a 10-minute walk with a tired 35-pound kid gets old. We chose this resort based on the good reviews and the fact that we saw it rated with 4 stars somewhere...it is definitely not a 4 star resort. The facilities are super nice (pool, beach, grounds are gorgeous) but the rooms are pretty run-down, very 1970's, which is surprising given that this is supposed to be the nicest of the three resorts. The pool was very nice, although so cold that only my son (accompanied by my brave husband) ever went in. That was really disappointing to me because I was really looking forward to taking the baby in and it looks like a really fun pool for little kids. The beach is really big and really crowded. Even when my family split up into small groups we had a hard time getting chairs -- and trying to find each other if we went out there separately was almost impossible.All that being said, if you've got more energy than money, this is probably a good choice for you.

<Content>AWESOME VACATION!!!! My husband and I were there November 15th -19th. This was a great vacation. The staff are all very nice and most speak english well enough to understand. The Star Friends are awesome. They get you very involved in the activities. The room was very nice. There was a slight musty smell when we first got there but got used to it right away and it didn't bother me. The room was recently remodeled. It had a nice king size bed with a couch, mini-bar, tv... Everything you needed in a room.The food was great. We ate at the Japenese, Gourmet and the steakhouse along with the buffet. At the buffet you can get almost anything you like. There are plenty of choices. Lunch and breakfast were also very good. The beach was beautiful. Nice sand and blue water. We walked up and down the beach every day and loved it. There are plenty of topless women and men in speedos!!! The sun is very hot down there. Make sure you wear a lot of sunscreen. It did rain everyday but only for a few minutes. The only thing I didn't like about the resort is that there are a lot of smokers. Also they need to add music at the pool and the beach. It gets very quiet. They also need to spread out there activities. They must have about 5 different activities going on at 3:30 but no activities between 1-3:00 pm. My husband I would have loved to do more of the activities but you can only choose one at each time. I would definetly go back again. It was a great trip!!!!

<Content>Great place Great trip overall, the hotel was fabulous. The workers at the hotel were all nice and went out of their way to make sure you had a good time. They always had smiles on their faces and remembered you. They danced and sung while they worked and their service was great.Rooms: The entire property has junior suites, which are pretty large. The rooms all have a terrance or balcony, depending on your floor. We had a king size bed which was large and comfortable. You have TVs in the room with english channels, a minibar with water, soda, beer. The bathrooms were new and large as well, with always warm water from the shower. The rooms do have a mildewy smell, even the renovated rooms, but you get over it quick, you aren't in there too much.Food: Buffet was good, lots of options. Wednesday night is lobster night, caribbean lobster, so small with about 3 forkfuls of lobster tail meat...but to me it was much sweeter adn delicious than Maine lobster. Also they have dorado, local white fish, pasta, salads, fruits, breads, cheeses at all the meals. Specialty restaruants, we went to Gourmet (get the lobster appetizer, it was the best!), which was pretty good. And we went to the mediterrean restuarant, which had an aweseome appetizer buffet. As for wine, not good, skip it all together. Go for the bohemia beer or drinks at the bar. Also, we drank the water and ice cubes, no problems with GI system, they filter their own water there, so it doesn't do you in.Beaches: Fabulous! White sand, clear water, absolutely amazing. We walked for hours every day in either direction, gorgeous beach and very safe. Many europeans, so topless women and speedos for men is a common site. Water was clean, warm and great to swim in. Snorkeling off hotel property wasn't bad, lots of fish and some coral, but not the best. Would take a trip next time.Pool: Nice, but didn't spend a lot of time there, beach is nicer. But overall nice and clean.Activities: Always something to do if you wanted, or you can veg out, read a book at the beach, walk, swim. Great overall.Tours: Didn't take one, we booked with liberty travel, so you go with Prieto tours automatically. Not bad, read the reviews on them adn was suspect, but they were on time for pick up and for departure, so no complaints. Would take the snorkel trip through the dive center and not prieto tours, because at the dive center you go straight from there, with tour company, take a bus, get on a boat...etc.Would I do it again? you bet, would go back to Iberostar if price is right again.

<Content>Only the most spoiled would complain about this hotel! Our stay at the Iberostar Barvaro was more than expected. Everything was top-notch and the hotel mgmt and staff go out of their way to make the vacation as comfortable and hassle-free as possible. Unless you are a prima donna, you are going to love this place. We had no problems with the musty room smell some reviewers have mentioned. I think that is because we asked for a renovated room and that is what we got. (gorgeous room!)It was as perfect as I would expect but one note of caution to those of you who want to keep up with your workouts at the gym. The hotel gym is not air conditioned and semi-outdoors. The weather is quite hot and humid and unless you are the type who can tolerate the temps, you will find it difficult to workout (even in the morning).

<Content>Great Vacation We stayed at this resort October 22-29. A brief recap:We traveled from St. Louis, booked through Apple, direct flight. Good trip. Arrival at airport was very smooth, in and out in 30-45 minutes. Trip to resort about 40 minutes, and not as scary as we had been lead to believe.Check-in--we had to wait about an hour for our room, but very smooth process.Food--buffet was average to good in comparison to other all-inclusives we've stayed at. Don't forget the king prawns on Wednesday night-excellent! We ate at four of the ala carte restaurants: Mexican--fair, Mediterraen--good, Japanese--good, French Gournet--very good.Service--we had no complaints regarding anything. Everyone on staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. No problem communicating--I only know a few words of Spanish, and rarely needed them.Rooms--ours appeared to have been renovated. No smells of any kind in the room. Very clean.Beach--beautiful!Weather--HOT!! Rained several evenings, brief showers one morning.Tours--we only went on the Outback Safari tour. Good tour, although very warm. Petra (Apple rep) gives good advice on which tours are worthwhile.Airport departure--Hot and frustrating. Don't dress for the weather back home, and be prepared for long lines.Would we return--absolutely, except maybe not during rainy season. We would rate this resort toward the top of our list (five trips to Mexico and one to Jamica). Truly a relaxing vacation!

<Content>It Felt Like Home We just returned from 10 glorious days (Oct. 12 鈥?22/06) at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. This would be our 6th stay at an Iberostar Hotel. The hotel is huge, is kept clean and the staff is absolutely wonderful. We had a magnificent time, despite rain almost everyday 鈥?Bingo to the rescue.Animation/Entertainment: This team is lead by 2 of the greatest Friends. Thank you Huck and Armando for making it so much fun. We were quite a challenge when it came to participating but Huck never gave up and managed to do the impossible. Thank you, Armando, for making sure we were well taken care of and making it feel like home. This team of young men and women work very hard at what they do and try their best to get everyone involved. We will make a big effort to join in on the Club Dance when we return to Bavaro. Accommodation/Services: Reception Desk, Housekeeping, Guest Services, Bellboys, Waiters/Waitresses, 鈥?all score a 10. Being early risers and at breakfast by 8 am, our room was always made up by 9:00 am. Beware of the rooster that doesn鈥檛 know you are on vacation! Reception called every 2 days to make sure that everything was going well - such a nice touch.Food: We basically stuck to the buffet, which was more than adequate for us. We did have dinner at the Cajun and Steakhouse restaurants and they were fine. This was our first visit to Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana, DR and will definitely not be our last.

<Content>Musty Rooms/Good Staff First the bad- After numerous attempts to get rid of the musty smell in my two suit cases of new clothes (including lingerie, evening wear, swim suits), I had to throw everything away. I tried everything from soaking for days to numerous detergents including lysol. The smell was overwhelmingly toxic. I even had to throw away my plastic beach bag. I am quite upset about this but I remember they made sure you sign a waiver of upon exiting. The waiver stated they are not responsible for any losses, etc. Unfortunately, I did not notice the overwhelming smell until I unpacked.The room I was in appeared to be newly refurbished near the beach. Room 1210. I did not drink the water, brush my teeth, or wash my face with it . I did not get sick at any point.Food- I did find the food to be just OK in the restaurants and buffet. I have traveled extensively both in Europe and the Carribean. I have stayed at many all-inclusives. (my opinion on previous post regarding American foods)I will say you can not expect anyone to cook ethnic food well that is outside of their culture. So I did not expect good hamburgers or pizza. (An American staple)Entertainment- I thought they made an effort to keep everyone entertained. I enjoyed the shows.Tours- I went on the Kontiki Boat tour and it was OK. They tried very hard to make sure you had a good time. It included snokeling.Vendors on the beach- Beware!!! Very pushy and rude. I purchased from the hotel and got a good price without haggling.Staff- The staff was wonderful. I have read previous reviews about people being rude. I did not encounter this at any point. I do know a little bit of Spanish and they did enjoy hearing it. I made sure I tipped everyone also. It is expected in any country when good service is rendered. So I did not find this unusual. Also in any county when you tip, you do get better service. The people are very poor, but work very hard to please you and convince you to return. The resort was well maintained, but I was really turned off with the clothes experience. I would not return because of this.

<Content>Forum gives a false positive on this one! My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana from Oct 14 - 21, 2006. It was as pretty a resort as we have stayed at and the accomodations were very comfortable. However, I am not sure why this resort received all the rave reviews that it has. The first sign after a very simple check in was to be given a map with our room circled and we were to find it ourselves!!!!! We did on the first try and 15 minutes later our luggage all arrived, but this was an omen of the comfort level of this resort. The next thing was that for 2 days we had tropical downpours. Not so bad in and of itself, but no umbrellas were provided. By the time we were able to get to the lobby to buy one, we were drenched and chilled. The only way we could get a bottle of wine to our room was to go to the guest services desk in the main lobby, buy the wine ($25-35 for what we would rate a $5 bottle of wine), and then designate the time on the NEXT day when we would like it delivered. The pool was smaller than Paradisus or Secrets' pools. The employees were as nice as could be as were the tourists. The ala carte restaurants were okay and the buffet was quite good and we were able to make four dinner reservations and think we probably could have made more since this was the off season. We ran into people returning for their 4th and 5th times and we can't quite figure out why. It is definitely less expensive than the Paradisus Resorts, Royal Hideaway, The Reefs, etc. but you also are not at the same level of service - especially the room service. This is the first time in nine years that Trip Advisor Forums have given us a bum steer. Disappointed in Connecticut

<Content>Very nice hotel My husband and I just returned from our stay at the Iberostar Bavaro (10/22- 10/25). Overall, we had a very nice vacation. I read through most of the recent reviews before we left and found the majority of them to be right-on and very helpful.The ride to the hotel from the airport was not as bad as some people have mentioned here. We booked through Apple vacations and were taken to the hotel by air-conditioned bus. We were dropped off first, so it took about 1/2 hour from the airport. The ride was comfortable and not harrowing in the least. We've driven through the Amalfi Coast - that's harrowing.I would agree that October is not the best month to visit the Dominican Republic. It was overcast and rainy one whole day we were there. That day the ocean was pretty rough so we couldn't swim. The other days were sunny and very, very humid with periodic rainshowers, especially at night. On the plus side, this is their slow season so the resort was practically empty. We had no problems finding chairs near the pool or beach. They also allowed us to eat in the specialty restaurants all 3 nights we were there. Usually there is a limit on the number of reservations you can make at the specialty restaurants depending on the length of your stay. Service was outstanding. Food was good, not great, with the exception of the Gourmet restaurant which was FANTASTIC. The Mediterranean and Steakhouse restaurants were also good. The buffets had a wide variety of food to choose from. We did not get sick and had no problems drinking the filtered water at the resort. The beach is clean and beautiful, one of the best we've been to and we've been to many beaches in the Caribbean and in Europe. The water was a brilliant turquoise, warm and calm (except for the day it rained). For the beach alone, I would return to Punta Cana. Bring bug spray and lots of it.I took someone's recommendation from these reviews and faxed the hotel a letter one week before our stay asking for a newly renovated room, on the second floor, near the beach, with a king size bed. We got everything we asked for. The room (1174) was clean and comfortable (no musty odor) and the bathroom was exceptional. The pillows were a little skimpy but not a huge deal. We asked for more and they brought them right away.There were a lot of activities scheduled daily that you could participate in. We especially loved the bachata, meringue and salsa dance lessons by the pool. The nightly entertainment was great; interactive and lots of fun. Drinks were good. As many people have commented on, few resort employees speak and understand English (especially the waiters). It was very helpful that my husband spoke a bit of Spanish otherwise we would have had difficulty communicating. The front-desk employees and those that do the nightly entertainment do speak more English. It's a great opportunity to brush up on your Spanish. Bring a language book, if needed.Overall, it was a very nice vacation. At the airport we talked to people who stayed at other resorts and didn't like them as much mainly due to problems with cleanliness and food. The Iberostar Bavaro is an excellent resort. Next time we'll stay longer than 3 nights and go during high season (December - February).

<Content>Good And Bad Punta Cana - Iberostar Bavaro BeautifulOct 15 to Oct 22-2006Frequent Trip Advisor Reader To begin with I have never written a review before - but I felt that all the reviews I read before I went were helpful. So to begin with we arrived and even having requested newly renovated rooms through our travel agent we were given older rooms which had a very very strong musty odor. To the managements credit after we presented a copy of our faxed request (even though they denied ever receiving it) they did give us three new rooms. These rooms are far superior to any of the others with very little odor.  I would not suggest October as a travel month as it rains nearly every day sometimes very loud thunder-lighting. Be sure to bring an umbrella the rain usually doesn't last all day. We ate at the steak house and the Cajun restaurants both were good but be prepared to wait an hour or more for meal completion.(slow service). The breakfast-lunch-and dinner buffets were fantastic. Lots of choices and the waiter were extremely helpful. Went on the Outback Safari -Culture Shopping Trip - and Deep Sea fishing trips. All of them were well worth the cost. The Dominican people couldn't be kinder or more pleasant to be around if they tried. And Petri our Apple Vacations Rep. was the best we have ever had. We would definately go Iberostar and Apple Vacations on a future trip.

<Content>wonderfull, highly recommended We had a family vacation in Iberostar Bavaro in November 2005 - me, my husband and 2 boys - 15 and 13. We're staying in a nice villa in the second raw from the beach and close to the pool. It was enough space for the whole family - 2 double bads and one sofa were accomodating us comfortably. We did not have any problems - stuff was excellent, beach wonderfull ( a little rough waves for me, but it's fun for the boys!). Food was very good, pool in Bavaro was too cool for me, I prefer it warmer, but in neigboring Iberostar Domonicana we could use wonderfull huge and warm pool and we did couple of times. We ate wonderfull breakfast and dinner by the lobby and lunch at the beach restorans (both Bavaro's and Dominicana's). My husband went snorkeling on the right side of the beach (close to the market) and found A LOT of beautifull HUGE shells (no animals inside) which we brought home and gave other people to keep. We did not care about entertainment, just wanted to relax on a beach. We did not have any problems to find shady place under palapa on the beach any tima a day. Resort is big but managable to walk. I like to go new places but Iberostar Bavaro in my list to go again sometime.

<Content>3rd time, still love it, bring donations My wife and I along with 7 other couples spent the week of 9/10 - 9/17 at the Iberostar Bavaro. The Bavaro is undergoing some updating. Part of the resort was closed off to visitors. Don't know how long his will go on, but this is their slow season anyway.For us and one other couple this was our 3rd stay here. Two other couples were making this their 2nd time. The rest were first-timers.Most of the other reviews pretty much echo our thoughts. Beautiful resort, good food, top shelf booze, swim-up bar, gorgeous beach, plenty of palapas for shade, usually good snorkeling right off the beach, very friendly resort workers, etc., etc.The evenings were still pretty warm and the only air conditioning is in your room or at the restaurants (except for the Steak and Buffet restaurants) Speaking of the Steak House Restaurant, it's not quite the same beef we're used to here in the states. They do have chicken, pork and seafood, but the steaks were just OK. The buffet would be a better choice. They try hard and the service/presentation were very nice, but you can't blame them for not having corn-feed angus on the menu!The ocean was churned up by a hurricane that was quite a distance away. Kept us from any good snorkeling.The evening entertainment was some of the better we've seen. They work very hard and long hours. I was told the entertainers work 15 days on and 3 days off. Oh yeah - their days are 16 hours long! Huck, Donkey and Maximo, along with all of the entertainment staff, did a great job.Some of us just hung out the beach and relaxed while others in our group participated in the planned activities (bingo, dancing, Spanish lessons, volleyball, bocce ball, etc.) Fellow travelers Todd and Merle went parasailing several times and even took a disposable camera up with them and got some amazing photos.This was our 13th trip to the DR/Jamaica/Mexico (Caribbean side) and won't hesitate to return to the Ibero Bavaro.The only very small complaint I have is that we did not find out about the returning guests get-together until the night before we were leaving. Found out about it from Huck (entertainer extraordinaire!) Don't know if it was the responsibility of our Apple Vacations rep or someone from the resort, but we were left uninformed. It's not a big deal, but a thank you for returning would have been appreciated.What I would REALLY like to say is BRING DONATIONS!!!! School supplies and baseball equipment are in short supply. This is a very poor country and it's a small effort to bring something along. Each couple in our group bought a back pack and filled it with school supplies - pencils, pens, notebooks, erasers, etc. I had posted a question on the message board and got a reply from new friend Patricia Ulan, better known as Kaki. She had me go to [--]. There are links on the right hand side that are for donation information. They are [--]and [--]You just email ahead of time with 'where' and 'when you'll be there' and owner Rafael Silva will send a driver to your resort to pick up you donations. There are pictures at the website of some of the children and the donated supplies. For the good it does, it takes very little effort on your part. DO IT. Besides, you'll feel good that you may have made a difference in some child's less fortunate life.Lastly, bring some tip money. It's not required, but a few bucks to the workers would mean a lot to them.Happy travels!Pete  Mary ALSO: Cindy/Beeps, Cindy/Rodger, Sheryl/Moe, Larry/Debbie, Theda/Todd, Faye/Merle and Mary/Ted (aka Mr. Iberostar!)

<Content>iberostar bavaro just the BEST! We just returned from a 4 day stay in punta cana. All I can say is WOW. The newley renovated rooms are excellent. The food is fantastic. Both the buffets and restaraunts that require reservations are excellent. This is the first time that we went all inclusive. It is without a doubt the way to go. We liked everything so much that we are going to try to go back in the summer for a week with our teenag kids. There are so many great activities on the resort , its tough to choose. The thing that impressed us the most were the people of the dominican republic. They are the friendliest most honest people that we have ever encountered. Everyone say Ola ( spanish for hello). The waiters remember your name when they see you the next day. We went with Apple Tours. Their rep at the hotel is named Petra. She was great. gave us lots of helful tips about the hotel and which excursions were good and which were not worth the money. We have been to many places in the carribean. This was by far the best.

<Content>Great vacation time, just relax and enjoy! An excellent hotel with responsive service. The beach is pristine. The food is abundant and rather creative. There are tons of things to do at any time of day, and the staff are focused on keeping you entertained.You have to remember one thing: you are on the Dominican time. People do not understand neurotic multitasking here. You need to relax, and this is truly essential for your enjoyment. The only instant gratifications you should expect here are the natural beauty of the ocean and the radiant smiles of the staff.

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Just returned from the IB Bavaro two days ago (stayed 9/30-10/7) with my wife as we celebrated our 20th anniversary. This is our second year in a row to stay in an Iberostar property, last year we stayed the Par. Lindo in Mexico. Many people who have stayed in one of these properties are interested in the other. The resorts are very different, yet the Iberostar consistency also makes them very similar. That's a topic for the forums and not a review here.The pros:Resort was very beautiful -- buildings are no higher than the palm trees and are 8 rooms (4 per floor) to a building. Peacocks and other birds roam the grounds. Somehow they keep it all free of droppings.Food -- we ate at the gourmet rest. twice and Japanese once. Food was good, not great, but met our expectations. The buffett for dinner was very good and we had lobster both Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Breakfast and lunch buffetts were fine, fully acceptable.Drinks -- no problem with quantity or quality, don't expect top shelf liquors or beer. Beer is Presidente, a good light carribean style beer.Capacity -- remodeling is in full swing and at least 15 of the buildings were being done. The rest of the hotel was no more than 75% full as this is low season. I could not tell how much longer the remodeling will take. Rooms -- nice mini suites. Clean and well kept. Our room had been romodeled recently and was very nice. People -- friendly and very responsive. We screwed up our safe and had to have someone come open it. It took five minutes from the call to when help arrived. A small price to pay for my stupidity. When it was time to leave the call for luggage pick-up to receiving a knock on the door was less than two minutes. I noticed on days when there were a lot of people checking out they have luggage carts waiting at various points in the resorts. The wait staff and bartenders were outstanding.Weather -- rain two nights and about five minutes during one morning.Cons --We were at the far southern edge of the resort and it was a long hike to the casino or the other properties. Not a big deal as we only went twice.Others --If topless sunbathing offends you, skip this and all other Punta resorts. They limit it to the beach and everyone seems to comply. People who visit this resort and are surprised to see this, don't do enough research.The trip from the airport to the resort is 40 minutes. Go to the bathroom before you leave, the road is bumpy and a little harrowing.We used Delta to and from, also saw American and Continental. Try getting pricing and scheduling from these airlines and compare to anything you get from Apple or whoever you book through. We used freq. flier miles so had no air costs other than taxes.Tourist cards are required to enter the country. You buy these just past baggage claim and just before passport control. $10 a piece. Bottom line is this resort is a very good choice and like other Iberostar properties delivers a very high level of service.

<Content>Brilliant hotel We'd stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro for 1 week in March and has a brilliant holiday. The hotel has excellent facilities, large and clean rooms, extremely friendly staff and a great location right on the beach.The food was also very good - both the buffet and the a la carte restaurants. You should book the restaurants as soon as you arrive to make sure that you do get to try them during the week.The evening ents were pretty good too - if you are just there to relax and have fun and laugh at a whole host of nationalities make idiots of themselves! If not, there are plenty of other places to sit and have a drink.We also visited the nightclub - hazy recollections of dancing and sambucas and then over to the casino where we got lucky on the roulette table and won plenty to leave all the staff good tips - which by the way they truly do deserve because they really were friendly and helpful, something we noticed stright away.I was only on the site today to find the link to recommend this place to my sister and I'm really pleased to see it's made the number 1 position in the rankings - in my opinion it really is deserved. We liked it so much we've booked the Iberostar Varadero in Cuba for November.

<Content>Peacock Paradise!!! My family stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro September 1-8, 2006.The trip from Pittsburgh directly to Punta Cana was without incident. Found the Punta Cana airport to be less taxing then when we went to Cancun. Just remember it's 10 buckaroo's to get in! The ride to the resort was interesting as well as the AppleRepresentative telling us about Punta Cana. I suggest an Apple tour...they are fabulous!The resort and grounds were meticulous. Bavaro is excellent. The staff is lovely. I didn't find an unhappy person at the facility. They love tips so make sure you take plenty of one dollar dinero's for just that . My 14 year old son was just busy as ever with pool activities and such. He did the scuba diving and loved it. We also took the Outback tour to the mountains which gives one a look into how the Dominicans really live. We even stopped at a school and were sung to. Make sure you get your hands on some Dominican champagne...you'll get a kick out of it!Make sure that you have plenty of aspirin and sun lotion because it will be very expensive if you need to purchase any of theseitems there...as the boy scouts say...be prepared!The only negative of the trip is the musty smell in the rooms.Take along some dryer sheets and put them in your suitcases and in your dirty clothes bags. Our luggage still has the scentbut it's funny how I minded it there but it's not so bad now because it reminds me of the trip. Bring candles or incense to burn as well. You'll be happy you did.Enjoy your stay in Punta Cana..it's fab and very kid friendly!!Peace Out

<Content>Beautiful Island Beautiful People! Where do I start? We stayed at the Bavaro from Aug. 13th thru the 21st. I read all the reviews before I left and if you believe any of the negative ones you're crazy...We had a smooth flight from Newark, NJ to Porta Platta, D.R., beautiful airport. One suggestion, before you get in line with your passports etc, buy the required $10.00 entry card as they did not instruct us so we had to scramble to hold our space in line.The ride from the airport was no different than a ride down any back road I have been on. The driving gets a little hairy at times but hey I'm from Jersey and this was a walk in the park.The welcome at the hotel was great. Banana Mama drinks for everyone. We had 17 family members with us!!! Just remember to get your safe key before you leave the lobby. The room was fine. We stayed in 2464 which is behind the pool. It did have the musty smell that everyone talks about but was super clean with absolutely no bugs at all. I brought some Lysol and it keeps the musty smell down. It does get into you're clothes so bring the dryer sheets for the luggage and wash them good when you get home. I think the problem here is the A/C is not like in the states, if they had a dehumidifier hooked up to the A/C like we do it would kill the musty smell. It was hot and sunny everyday, only one small shower. The restaurants are air conditioned and if you can when your in the buffet get the outside tables where you can catch a breeze. (Fans are on all the time). The food was good. I found plenty to eat. Some things are strange to you but I didn't have a problem. Not one and I mean not one of us got sick!!! We drank the table water, had ice in our drinks etc. The buffets were extemely clean, The breakfast buffet is enclosed... No flys, the lunch is outside by the pool and was also clean.The pool was great... The only problem is the slippery pool deck. Be careful when you walk around the pool. The Dominican people were awesome. Hats off to Leonardo and Santana at the beach bar.. Go Yanks!!!! They were the best.To sum it up, I loved it all, the beach, the pool, activties, casino but most of all the wonderful hard working Domican people.Hope to got back in the future.

<Author>Juliens
<Content>Best holiday ever Date 9th - 23rd August 2006Reviewer - The Julien family from EnglandI can only start with saying what a fantastic time we had. We took our 14 year old son Sebastian with us, so hoped there would be plenty for him to do. After all if he enjoys it, so do we! By the end of the first day he had made lot's of friends from England, America, Spain, Belgium etc and had joined in numerous activities, including water polo, archery, football  team games.After that we didn't see him for 2 whole weeks. There is a great sports bar, ideal for teenagers and they do a great steak too! Do make sure you ask for one of the renovated rooms, they are far superior to the old ones. The staff are lovely, always smiling and friendly and deserve the well earned tips we gave them. These guys work from early morning to late at night and can't do enough for you. The entertainment guys are just amazing. How they do it day in day out I don't know. If you are happy to join in the activities including the shows at night, these guys make sure you have a lot of fun! Special recognition goes to Daisy, Isobel, Jonathan and Wilson. My husband was pleased to take home his Diploma for 'Mr Sexy'. In total we took home 10 t-shirts and 3 bottles of rum.The night club DC6 is not bad. Nice decor, but very small dance floor. They do tend to play the same music, so we often went across to the nightclub at the Rui. A lot bigger and better music. Free entrance and only $5 in a taxi. If you enjoy dancing, the Dominican is the place to go. The Merengue and Bachata is simply great fun and the staff are always willing to teach you the moves.The grounds are just amazing. Flamingo's, peacocks and tropical fish are in abundance. You just can't beat sitting at breakfast and watching the Flamingo's! The lobby is spectacular, beautifully decorated and huge! The restaurants are great too. You can eat there 5 times in a fortnight, but we ate a total of 10 times as we kept getting cancellations at guest services. We found the Jambalaya, Steak House and the Gourmet restaurant the best, washed down of course with glasses of champagne, who can complain.We have been to the Caribbean for the last 7 years and this is certainly one of the best resorts we have stayed at. We stayed in the North last year, but here the beach is just paradise. Definately pay the extra to stay at the Bavaro. The Dominican  Punta Cana are nowhere near as nice. The pool area is too overcrowded and they do not have the same standard of facilities. There were always plenty of sun beds at the Bavaro. We didn鈥檛 have to worry about getting up at the crack of dawn. We often went down to the pool at 10.30am and had no problems. We went quad biking which was great fun and to Saona Island which is simply idyllic. Very hot though so take plenty of sun cream and a hat. The water is beautiful and we fed the fist with bread, which was good fun. The catamaran over is very relaxing, so don't expect loads of excitement, but the speed boat back is great fun. We stopped at a sand bank and found some star fish on the way back.We didn't want to come home and can't wait to go back!

<Content>The most gracious staff! We've visited many Caribbean islands and found the people in Punta Cana a real joy to be around! The resort is impeccably maintained, the grounds are beautiful and the buffet food is above average. The Bavaro gourmet restaurant was excellent...hats off to the Chef  staff! (Make all restaurant reservations upon arrival.)We recommend this resort without hesitation. ...I'm wondering, can we expect the same high level of service at all Iberostar resorts? If so, this will become a preferred chain for us.

<Content>2nd time-Loved It Even More!!! This was my husband's, daughter's (age 2) and my 2nd visit to this resort in less than a year. We loved it so much last year that we stayed 10 days this time around. We were surprised of all the renovations that occurred since we were there last Sept. The Canjun/Gournment restaurant, the wooden walkway and the new buffet room were not there last year. We were given a newly renovated room (absolutely beautiful) but due to the construction going on across the way and all the dust we decided to switch rooms which was still fine. The people who work there are truly amazing especially Claudia in the buffet, the whole animation team, Roland (always smiling) and Roberto (Donald Duck) at the lunch buffet and Rafael the bartender. They work such long hours and about 12 days straight so if you can tip them. They will really appreciate it. We had a wonderful time and plan to go back. I think once all the renovations are complete it will be even more spectacular than it already is.One last thing the food was good and a big variety to choose from. No complaints at all and we ate pretty much everything and did not get sick.

<Content>lovely grounds We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro, Punta Cana from Aug 8 to Aug 13 2006. Overall the vacation was great. We got to swim, eat, drink and rest. The hotel staff is overall nice and helpful, but we did have some minor issues with communication since we did not speak Spanish. The rooms were very nice. They had two double beds and a seating area. They also had a mini bar (frig with soda and water) this was a nice touch. We did have a couple problems with our room. The first night we had no hot water but maintenance responded very quickly. We also had ants in the room. The resort also lost power on several occassions (typically for brief periods of time). Maid service was fair. She did not replace washcloths or kleenex until it was brought to her attention. The grounds were the best part of the resort. They were adorned with trees and plants that were well maintained. There were peacocks, flamingos and chickens roaming freely. They had ponds with fish and turtles. The grounds were really beautiful. The pool was large and had various depths. It did attract debris (leaves, twigs) from the grounds. The beach was nice but had a fair amount of seaweed in the water and on shore. The beach was also very rocky (take water shoes). The food was fair. The buffet offered a variety. There were also restaurants with table service that required reservations. We ate at three of the restaurants the Cajun, Steak House and the Mediterranean one. The food at the steak house and cajun one was pretty good. The other wasn't very good. The service at all was poor. They took a long time to take orders and it was often disorganized when they did take the orders. Each night they would take orders from a portion of the party and then leave. We did take an excursion with VIP. We took the Saona Island/Catamaran excursion. This was an all day event approx 12 hours. The excursion took us by bus then by catamaran to the Saona Island. There we got to hang out on the beach which they called a natural pool. The water did not get more than a few feet deep as far out as I went. Later we took speedboats to a sandbar where we got to see and hold starfish. This part was awesome. However enjoying the beach, speedboats and starfish took about 2 hours. The other 10 hours of the day/excursion were a waste. The island had nothing to offer and in my opinion had a bad odor. The bus ride and catamaran ride were long and boring. I hope this provides some useful information. Always hard to decide where to go/stay.

<Content>Can't wait to go back to PC First of all, let me say that we have travelled numerous times to Cancun, Acapulco, St. Thomas, St. Martin, Tortola, San Juan, Key West, and Punta Cana. The Iberostar bavaro, in Punta Cana was absolutely the BEST we've seen. The resort is spacious, safe, clean, and buzzing with activities. The star friends (their staff members at the resort) were even able to entice my 16 year old son into a salsa lesson by the pool! They were always on the go  we felt as if we were welcome and appreciated at this resort. It was a true family vacation and there were plenty of activities (even for my 13 year old). FYI, Americans are in the minority (we saw mostly Europeans) and the Dominican peple love Americans as we use manners. The Dominican culture is based on respect and politeness. If you are rude, you will not have a very good time. Use manners, the Dominican people are lovely, hard working, and amazingly resiliant despite their poverty.Ceci  Mario, waiters in the buffet restaurant, were fabulous! They would delivery cafe' con leche to our favorite table as we entered the breakfast buffet daily, no waiting! The food was fine, always plenty to choose from. The buffet is unbelivable - fresh donuts made daily, local cocoa products, fresh foods of every imaginable type available. If anyone complains about the food, they shouldn't travel to foreign contries. If you try the native foods, such as paella, they can't be beat! It amazes me that people would expect the food to taste like it does here in America.....you're in a different country, (DUH)!We never got sick, all water is purified in hotels (including the ice cubes). Our Apple vacation rep. was extremely helpful. This resort is top notch in all aspects, and we plan to go back as soon as vacation time comes around again. After travelling to the Iberostar Bavaro, I now understand why so many travellers fall in love with the resort  return time and time again. If they had time shares here, we'd buy in a second!!!!Loved it!...Loved it!...Loved it!

<Content>The Best Holiday Ever!!! We stayed at the Bavaro from 2nd August until 17th August there were seven of us from the uk three teenagers and four adults.From the moment we landed at the airport we knew our holiday had begun the greeting of a band playing made you feel so welcome and the staff at the airport were very friendly, the transfer to the bavaro was a bit of a bumpy ride but we still felt very safe with the driver.On arrival at the Bavaro the check in was very simple and we were greeted with a nice cool drink although people before have said dont drink it because of the ice all the ice is made with purified water and is safe to have in your drinks. We had requested three rooms close together and they accomodated our request we were in rooms 2541,2543 and 2544 just of the main walkway and close to the pool and beach we had asked for beach front but due to the renovation work there were none available in hindsight we were very pleased with the rooms we got as the location was very central for everything we wanted ,our rooms were not the renovated ones but we were still very pleased with them we did look at the new rooms and they were very nice and i am sure that in time all the rooms will be done as they are working very hard to maintain the excellent standard.The grounds are very beautifull and the staff work all the time to make sure they stay that way the peacocks and flamingoes only add to paradise experience. The pool was wonderful and we had no problems getting beds the same also applied on the beach wich by the way when i was sat on it i thought i had died and gone to heaven need i say anymore!!!!I have read a lot of people saying bad things about the food i dont think they stayed the same place as we did,the food was fab we ate in the buffet the beach bar and the pool buffet also we got 8 reservations at the Bavaro restaraunts and one at the dominicana my top tip would be pay the extra to stay at the Bavaro as they are all airconditioned and this made it all more enjoyable, the food was excellant in all the Bavaro restaurants and we tried them all.Now to the best bit the staff they work so hard to make your holiday the best ever the waiters and waitress all the bar staff the star friends are just amazing i have never met such happy people anywhere else in the world they provide you with all day and night entertainment if you so wish and are not offended if you choose not to take part, the shows we saw were very good although we did only see two but when we return we will try to see more .Another top tip if you are travelling with teenagers they have to be wearing a white band to get into the night club i think it is age 16 and over although we had a 15year old with us so we changed her band and there were many 15 year olds in the disco had we not changed her band she would have been dissapointed, we had no issue with the teenagers bieng safe and they had a fab holiday meeting kids from all over the world.To finish this review i will say that we will be returning to the Bavaro and would not hesitate in reccomending this resort to anybody as you will find there is something for every age group and you can do as little or as much as you wish.

<Content>Bavaro Vacation I stayed at IberoStar Bavaro from Aug 6th until Aug 13th. First of all if you are going to stay at the IberoStar resort, pay the extra $14.00 a day for Bavaro and not the Domenica or Punta Cana - there is hardly anything to do at those 2 resorts. The ride from the airport to the resort was kind of sad - Dominican houses and little bicycles with motors showed how poor their country actual is. When you first get to the resort one of the ladies brings you a welcome drink - do not drink it - it has ice in it and really upset my stomach. The rooms are beautiful. Big enough and very very nicely decorated. The pool area beautiful also, alot of activities to do during the day from dance classes, to water games to beach volleyball games. The beach is right past the pool area - the ocean was very clean but not as blue as i thought it would be. Wear lots of sunblock you get burned very quickly and do not even realize it. Dinner well that was the worse part of my vacation. All their foods taste funny. Hamburgers do not taste like they should nor does any of the meats. Potatoes are not boiled throroughly. Shows at night very well performed and get the audience involved alot. I also did horseback riding on the beach which was a great experience - 2 hrs for 55 dollars. Also bargain with the Dominicans. If you say your going to walk away they will follow you and settle for the deal you made. Also, for all you animal lovers - you will see alot of stray dogs around - they are very friendly - try to bring bottled water from the room for them they are very hot in the sun all day. Overall, I had a very relaxing time at this resort, just watch out for the food - bring alot of immodium and malox:)

<Content>A great family vacation Let me begin by saying that Trip Advisor really helped qualify where to stay in the DR; if used correctly, it will answer all your questions, give you peace of mind and answers almost every question or concern you can dream up.My wife and I traveled to IB 8/2-9.(celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary) along with our 3 boys 12, 10  7 and had a wonderful family vacation; probably the best gettaway as a family that we've ever had. This was our 1st All-Inclusive as a family and quickly learned after traveling to Atlantis 2 years ago, that this is the only way to go w/ 3 boys that are constantly hungry or thirsty.To help other potential Family travelers this is what we did to ensure we rec'd. what we wanted: Set your priorities of what is most important... ours was 1. connecting room, 2. 2nd floor and 3. close to beach and pool. Knowing that having a connecting room was paramount and also knowing that no hotel will guarentee you a connecting room, I found (thru a previous IB review) that Rosa at the front desk took care of a family w/ a similar situation). So, my biggest recommendation is to make sure the connecting room is in your profile when booking (BTW, they only have 24 connecting rooms out of 534 or so), spend the $40. or so that it's going to cost you to call the IB front desk... I asked for Rosa and told her that I read about her kind service on-line (muster-up your best Eddie Haskell personality). At the time they had no renovated connecting rooms, which wasn't a big deal... the room was perfectly fine. .. IB is in the process of completley gutting out several quad complexes that would be considered 4-star by most (before renovation)... it's obvious they're keeping up the image to be the best of the best in Punta Cana. Seguing back; we purchased flight insurance for peace of mind ($450,for 5 of us), it's Aug. in the carribean; considering the total cost of the package, it made sense just in case. Well, a tropical storm (Chris) was named and tracked to graze Punta Cana, we flew from Boston to San Juan and saw in SJ airport the weather pushing it a bit north (sigh of releif). We took a puddle jumper into PC airport, very nice, new, clean and friendly (I found out during our stay that PC airport is privately owned by Julio Englasis, Oscar De Lahoya and Frank Russeiro (sp?) . The paid-for minivan ride from the airport to the hotel wasn't as bad as reviews claimed, you get a 1st hand view of how the natives live, but it's all part of the trip. Don't forget to tip the driver and the guide that rides shotgun. OK... checking-in, I immediately asked for Rosa, as you want to keep the connection as much as poss., she already had the connecting room picked-out, on a 2nd floor located 3-units back from the beach... no other connecting rooms that were closer. BTW, they don't have true king beds, they put full-size beds together, but you need to request this in advance, or it'll take you longer to get into your room (it's all in the pre-calling!). The lobby area is a beautifully decorated open-air carribbean paradise. The grounds are very well groomed w/ Flamingos, Peacocks, Koi-ponds throughout. Don't expect an ocean view room unless your the 1st set of quads on the water. We never left the grounds other than to go next door to the Iberostar Dominicana (gambled a bit), they had a cigar rolling guy in the same area as their Hard Rock type of bar/rest. place ( kids like this place, becuase it had pool tables and air hockey). We also ventured a few times to the local Hut-Market set-up by the natives directly on the beach about 200 yards to the right of IB beach... this was fun; bartering w/ the natives... you'll get your best deals here, especially with their local semi-precious stone Larimar... word to the wise go low and stay low, walk away and they'll bend, especially if you package a few items together. Only bring so much $ ea. trip to the huts, because you'll spend it all. The meals were very good, plenty of choices... the kids loved how Leonardo and co. (at the beach bar) would set'em up w/ Fry's, dogs and grill-pressed ham  cheese sandwhics (they even cut-off the crusts). We had a little advantage becuase the natives love the Boston Red Sox (Big Papi and Manny being from DR), so we had daily chit-chat on the nights prior game.Make dinner reservations when you arrive, as they can only seat so many people per specialty rest. due to the limited wait-staff (not lack of seating). Our favorites: Jambalaya and Japanese (excellent sushi apps). The buffet around the pool was used daily for brunch, lunch, late snack etc.. the kids loved the ice-cream station.Entertainment was good (light, friendly and fun for all), this was from 9-11 every night.Speaking of Entertainment, I can't say enough about the Star Friends, these young folks (20-30 yrs. old I'd say), work feverishly 12 -13 hrs. every day to keep you having fun w/ activities around the pool, beach and theater at night... simply amazing how hard they work to please you and to make sure your enjoying yourself. Please tip the folks that go out of there way to make your stay better... you'd be amazed how much they earn a month. Please bring at least a couple hundred dollars in $1 bills and $5's to tip your maid, towel women (Simone), Star Friends that befriend you and your family (Jonathan  William), and of course the bartenders where you frequent... it's not recommended, but it's greatly appreciated and you'll get get the service 10-fold back.What else can I say, we snorkled as a family on the grounds, this was a lot of fun... with the amount of coral reefs in the main beach area, we found this more than sufficient to enjoy w/o traveling outside the complex... save your time and money and snorkel at the beach. The sandy beach and turquise water is classic carribean... gotta love the sea baths in the morning. We took advantage of the beach-front massage huts... $30. for a half-hour, the wife  I had a side-by-side massage and it was worth every penny.Something to ponder... we hired the photographers on the premises (they sell photos of pictures of you w/ their fun animals for $8. ea.)... well we paid $100. for a private session down by the beach to take several fun posed pictures of the family (for our Christmas card), they came out great, I negotiated 2 - 5x7's and a CD w/ all the pro. shots on it.Health-wise: Don't drink too many Banana Mama's and other frozen drinks... they're good, but just in moderation. We brushed our teeth w/ bottled-water in the rooms and sipped the water they served at the rest.... but in the end you should expect to have 1 or 2 days of quezzyness, diareahea and/or oversunning. It's very hard not to over-indulge. Bring Rolaids, pepto and plenty of sun-screen and after-sun aloe... this will help.This was a great family vacation, hope this all-inclusive review helps you.-Boston, MA

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro is Excellent! We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana July 22 to August 3, 2006. Had a great time! We traveled with our kids ages, 17, 17, 16  12. We had 3 rooms. The check-in was easy. The rooms were really nice. One little thing is that the hotel controls the airconditioning in your room. I had to go to the front desk 2 times and ask them to make it cooler. They finally did and then it was VERY cold. Oh well, we would just open the paito door and let some cold air out!! The buffet was excellent, the staff very friendly and the grounds impecable!!! We did a lot of excursions: The jeep safari (it is a tour, but you drive the stick-shift jeep yourself). You make several stops. It was super fun and the kids had a great time! We also did the ATV tour. It was a blast! (you get pretty dirty!). We did the James Bond boat tour where your drive 2 passenger boats and then stop to snorkel. It was pretty good, but a little unorganized. We also did the scuba lesson in the pool and then did 2 dives. My kids had never scuba dived, so it was great. The staff was wonderful! We also did a dune buggie tour which was not good at all, but we made the best of it! We did the casino several times (we said the older kids were 18, so they got an adult bracelet). The casino was small, but what was really weird was the staff. They were not allowed to talk to you (like at the black jack tables) and didn't want you to talk either. Not like Vegas at all! But we made it fun anyway! All in all it was an excellent trip and we would recommend it highly! If you have any specific questions you can e-mail me at: dangel2362@cox.net

<Content>A great and relaxing vacation... I read many of the reviews here prior to traveling so I will just try to cover the basics that I learned on my trip. I (age 25) traveled for 5 nights with my mom and sister (23) for a girls vacation. As everyone will tell you the grounds and beach are beautiful. The sand is soft and I really like that there is a lot of shaded huts along the beach in order to take small breaks from the sun. I have medium to fair skin and I applied 30 on my face and shoulders and 15 sunblock on the rest and I did not burn. Prior to traveling, I recommend that you e-mail Iberostar directly (go to their website to find e-mail address) a week before your trip and request a renovated room, on the 2nd floor, near the beach. That is what I did and that is what I received when I checked in. I found the room to be clean. The bathroom was big with a tub and separate shower with glass doors so the bathroom does not get soaked. I brought a candle cause I have read about the musty smell, but I didn't need. I heard the first floor rooms tend to have more issues with bugs and smell so we were glad to be on the 2nd floor. I brought some dryer sheets to pack on the way home and my clothes smelled fresh upon arrival in the states. Our room was always clean and stocked with water. For 3 people in the room, we tipped $4 a day. We always brushed our with bottled bottle. We did drink the water in the dining room and no one got sick. As for the food, the buffet is average but I always found something to eat. The restaurants are great. All have A/C except steakhouse. I recommend Cajun and Gourmet. During our 5 day stay we only ate the buffet on the first evening. After 3pm you can go to the front desk and book any remaining time slots. The premade drinks at the bar are never frozen. In order to get a frozen drink order something that has to be made in the blender. I didn't realize this until the last day! The airport has an air-conditioned section. It's on the second part of the wing. You have to go up a ramp and around a corner and down some stairs. It was a hidden gem cause its not crowded on that side and its cool!!! If you have to wait 3 hours for your flight, like we did, I highly recommend finding a seat in the newer section of the airport. Also, if you book your package with APPLE you must pay the $10 per person fee to enter the country. However, Apple pays the $20 exit fee. Luckily, I had read this ahead of time. BEWARE! They will try to charge you at the airport. It took 3 airport agents to figure out we had already paid this fee. Finally, as for deciding which Iberostar hotel to stay at on the property, I was pleased that we went with the Bavaro. I had the hardest time deciding before I booked my trip. Essentially, the Bavaro side is less crowded as the other 2 hotels can not use the amenities at the Bavaro. I definitely liked both our beach and pool better. Also, at the Bavaro you can eat at all of the restaurants. The other 2 hotels are limited in their choices. And I like the suite style of the room. Anyway, if you are about to travel there - ENJOY - it is one of the most relaxing places on earth. Nothing better than sitting on the beach all day with a drink in hand and a good book!

<Content>Briliant time had by all We returned from the IB last Thursday after a fortnight's holiday. All I can say is I am sure the previous review is not written about the same hotel. We only ate at the main buffet restaurant on one evening (a Wednesday and the lobster was superb) but on the 13 other nights we ate at the a la carte restaurants. The standard of the food and the presentation was, in our opinion, excellent, the only thing we really didn't rate was the appetizer served in the gourmet restaurant and some of the desserts, as usual in holiday vacations, weren't too great. My husband and I travelled with our 16 year old daughther, her friend and our 18 year old son and his girlfriend, we all had a great time. There is entertainment every evening which varied in standard but always provided something to do, if you are staying at the IB you can use the facilities at both other Iberostar hotels and there is entertainment there as well (the Punta Cana is the less lively resort). We were really pleased we had paid the extra to stay at the Bavaro as the restaurants appeared to be of a much higher standard than the other 2 hotels (e.g. the gourmet restaurant at the Dominicana had a set menu whereas we had a lot of choice) I am assured by my husband that all the steaks he ate were really good. We enjoyed sitting at the beach restaurant (steak house in the evenings) at lunch time where there is always something different being cooked (paellas, joints of beef etc) Look out for Ronald a waiter with the biggest smile I have ever seen, he also works in the Meditteranean restaurant in the evenings and is a really lovely guy. There was never a problem getting a sunlounger we were by pool at 7.30 each morning and had pool to ourselves until at least 8.30-9.00 each day. The beach bar to the right of the hotel right on the beach is a lovely place to sit at the end of a long hot day. We went on trip to Saona island the island itself was quite disappointing but we really enjoyed the trip on the catamaran and the return trip o the speedboat, take some bottles of soft drink for the children as you get off the speedboat when you land and make them really smile. The beach vendors at the shacks to the right of the hotel also really appreciate any spare cokes, fantas etc. you may have in your mini bar.Definitely worth asking for a re-furbished room they are first class.Can't think of anything else but please don't hesitate to e-mail me if you have any questions. Oh one other thing as Thomas Cook are the only British tour company to go to the IB there are not many British people here, not something which worried us adults but our teenagers may have enjoyed a little more interaction with British teenagers. There were a lot more at the Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus where we stayed last year but we still can't make up our minds which hotel we preferred.pulfs@yahoo.co.uk

<Content>Loved It!!!!! We just got back on July 30th. We had the best time. The kids meet a bunch of other kids and spent most of the week with them. The service is incredible. These people can't do enough for you. The beach was beautiful. We never had a hard time finding a spot under the huts. The water was awesome. We were able to snorkle right off the beach. The best part about the beach was the breeze. You never felt heat. It is so relaxing. I have to say, there were alot of topless sunbathers, but after awhile you really didn't notice or care. The food was pretty good. There is something for everyone. We went to the steak house and the Japanease restaurants. They were very good. The only problem I had was the only place that had A/C was the a la carte restaurants and in July it's pretty hot. I would suggest that you eat along the edges of the dining hall or by the pool. At least there is alway a breeze. Let's talk about the shows. The one's that the Star player put on were a little cheesy and sexual, but they were ok. The dominican night show and the broadway shows were the best. Very professional done. Our room was very nice but did have the musty smell. I put dryer sheets in all our cloths so that they didn't smell. I think the problem was being resolved, because they were renovating our room right after we left. We had room 2348 and it had the most awesome view. The pool was great but is in desperate need of a new paint job. I hope that's going to be done soon because the rest of the place including the ground is beautiful.

<Content>you won't regret it... If you want a beautiful, relaxing, yet fun place to stay without paying a fourtune, then this is it. We booked through Apple Vacations and from start to stop it was all a breeze. Resort/Grounds- Absoultly gourgous. Beautiful foilage, picked up and pruned to perfection. Peacocks roam freely, lizards scamper across the brick walkway, flowers, fountains, and lots more to see. The lobby is open-aired, very big, and very nice.Rooms- Our room was great. The bed was huge, and pretty comfy. Not like my pillow-top at home, but no sore backs or necks. We always slept well, lovely balcony with vines, more little lizards and flowers. It was very nice for a room we barely spent time in. Fridge always stocked, nothing went missing, hot water, maid service was very good.Beach- This was the best part by far. The beach was gourgous. White sand and Turquoise waters. Sand was very soft, bearfoot all the way, but as in ANY part of the world watch out for coral in the water. I only saw 2 very small pieces in the 8 days I was there. The ocean is clean, refreshing, and not too crowded. Optional Topless(on beach only of course)- I thought this was great, actually one of my favorit parts. How wonderful men have it to be able to walk around without a shirt. I had never felt more liberated and comfortable in my whole life. I felt like I was a child all over, running around half naked. I would say about 70% of women went topless when I was there, so your actually in the minority if you don't. It is the norm there, so don't be afraid. Anyway, you'll never see them again anyway, and no tan lines!!Food- We made sure we got our moneys worth. The buffets were great all around...lots of choice. The resturants were all pretty good, but we preferred the buffet. We must have tried everything, and never got a hint of sickness. Drinks were also great...I must of had 500 Pina Colada's. The mixed drinks were good too.Excursions- We went on the Outback Safari and had a lot of fun. The country is beautiful and charming. Sad to see that it is very poor. Won't bore you with step by step, but it was worth the money, and very enjoyable.Staff- Service was fast and friendly. No one was ever rude to us, or unwilling to help.Nightlife- The night shows were hit and miss, entertaing for an hour or so, then you move on. But the atmosphere of this place is great. Friendly all around.Beach Vollyball, and lots of other fun stuff to take up your day.Overall, I would highly recomend this resort. I was blown away, and would return again in a heartbeat if there was'nt so much else to see in the world. But if I was ever to return to Punta Cana, I would'nt try another place, because I was so happy here.

<Content>nice resort, not a big fan of the food This resort was nice but not great. We booked a beach front room but didn't get one, they said they had none avail. cause overbooked. While there for 4 nights we lost power two of the nights, no lights, pitch black. just our hotel, no one elses. There was zero entertainment at night. No big t.v., no music, no shows. Incredibley Boring at night. The dinners were pretty good and the buffets were gross. My friends and fam. will not go back there.

<Content>Best Birthday Vacation Ever! I vacationed in Punta Cana @ Iberstar Bavaro from July 26-31. I traveled with my best girlfriend of 25 years (since age 17!); we celebrated our 42nd birthdays while in Punta Cana and what a place to celebrate.......I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS BIRTHDAY! By the way, I am a travel agent so my excellent review is not easily earned. Here is my feedback:1) Resort: It is absolutely fabulous! The grounds are beautifully landscaped with colorful flowers and luscious plants. Flamingos and Peacocks freely roam the property. There is water everywhere! Small lagoons with tropical fish surround the restuarants and buffet areas. There are quaint bridges that join the restaurants and walkways to the suites; a very nice touch. The entire resort is kept immaculately clean; from the grand lobby to your private suite. Housekeeping does a tremendous job!2) Suites: The suites are lovely; very clean and spacious. There is satellite t.v. - if you care to relax a day or two with room service. The suites are air conditioned with ceiling fan above the bed. I found the room to be very cool and comfortable. The air does automatically shut off if there is not movement detected in the room or if the patio door opens. This is NOT a problem; simply close the door and the air resumes. The bath is very nice as well. There is a towel rack on the balcony for wet suits and towels. There is also a comfortable couch for lounging on the balcony.3) Food: EXCELLENT! We dined in the Cajun/Jumbalya restaurant for my birthday and it was splendid. The presentation was tastefully done and the grilled salmon was superb. On Wednesday, we dined at the restaurant buffet - it was Seafood night and grilled prawns were abundent!! Most days we simply ate at the buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner; both were delicious with a multitude of choices! The poolside buffet was great for lunch as was the swim-up bar. You generally had burgers, hot dogs, fries, chicken, rice, fresh fruit, salads, desserts, etc. By the way, when I arrived; I order room service while settling into my room and waiting my friend's arrival from NJ. It took only 10 mins. to arrive! Very impressive. I also rec'd a complimentary bottle of rum and a fresh fruit platter as a welcome to the hotel and as a birthday gift.......nice touch! As guests @ the Bavaro, we we able to dine and play at the other 2 Iberostar resorts w/all-inclusive privaleges! This is a plus; STAY AT THE BAVARO; IT IS THE BEST OF ALL 3 PROPERTIES.4) Excursion: Did the Outback Safari; EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!!! The ONLY way to see the culture and understand the dominican people. The public beach at the end was spectacular and the lunch at the private ranch (gambia in espanol) was very good - a typical dominican menu! The calypso party cruise was canceled due to rough waters - but i hear that it is also very good. Apple Vacations will reimburse us for these fees. 5) Apple Vacations - THE ONLY WAY TO GO TO PUNTA CANA! They were wonderful from the outbound flight to onsite assistance. Out of BWI; you fly USA 3000 charter flight - very comfortable experience---- in-flight movie, small meal, beverage service and interesting facts displayed on monitor about Punta Cana. Petra - Apple Rep. onsite @ Bavaro was wonderful! Very helpful and friendly. I hope to see her again next year!6) Hotel Staff: EXCELLENT! The genuinely want you to have a great vacation and work each and every day to ensure that you do! The dominican people are very warm and festive! The animation team at this hotel were simply wonderful from the singers, show performers, waiters, waitresses, bartenders, reception desk, chefs, and tour guides.Summing things up; YOU MUST EXPERIENCE PUNTA CANA-------BOOK NOW!travelady247@aol.com

<Author>SueLovesTheBeach
<Content>A very nice resort We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from July 15 - 24, 2006. If you have not already booked here, go back and look at the RIU Palace Punta Cana instead. We walked down the beach to it (over a mile at least) to find the RIu had nicer, warmer pools, thick and beuatiful gold towles, and no seaweed on the beach. but, if you have already booked the Iberostar Bavaro, don't despair. We did have a very good week there.First of all, you should request a room that is close to the beach. I did so through my travel agent. We received 1317 which was as close as possible to both the pool and the beach. Our room was very nice and clean. We saw no bugs and had no smells other than that of a different place from home. We did tip our maid three dollars and day, and we received everything we asked for such as bath gel and water. Only drink water from bottles and brush your teeth with that too. Do not buy any trips or packages from the beach vendors. We met some people who saved twenty dollars a person by doing so, but they found that what was promised was not the case. Stick with the reputable packages sold in the lobby. We bought beautiful conch shells on the beach from a scuba diver. We had no trouble getting them through United States customs, although I think that may not be the case if you are traveling to Europe. The Punta Cana airport is a nightmare. No air conditioning, no signs, no one speaks English. They do check all bags by hand. The open them while you watch and paw through them. It takes forever so take some water from the room and perhaps a snack if you have children with you. Remember, no fruits can go through customs. Also, do not wait to buy duty free liquor. There is nothing to choose from at the airport. Wear your coolest clothes too. Be careful what you eat. My husband had an omelet one morning and he allowed them to put what they wanted in it. Salmon!!!! Yikes. He did eat some of it, and was sick for two days. He also ate pizza with meat on it. I think they recycle food and and not always careful about how long some things are out in the heat. My son and I did not get sick, but we were more discriminating about our choices.The grounds are beautiful at this resort. The flamingos eat our of your hand in the main buffet. Peacocks are everywhere. It is well maintained and lovely. I did not find many people working there who speak enough English to hold a conversation, but that was not a problem for me. I like not listening to beach conversations and always having to hear other peoples' discussions.The beach bar is wonderful. You can have a rum punch and some french fries for lunch ( and a hamburger and hot dog if you are brave). The food was fairly good at every meal. The beach is wide and flat, with lovely tall palm trees. The water is warm and very few waves. It is not clear enough for snorkeling though. Some coral in the water, but not enough to bother with water shoes. All in all, a very good week at a very nice resort. Enjoy..

<Content>It was Okay We just got back today from a 8 night, 7-day stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. The good stuff: The food was good! I would recommend the speciality restaurants for a change in food and air conditioned environment. The grounds were beautiful and well kept.  The best excursion was offered by Apple Vacations The Safari Tour; you get a true view of the Dominican people and culture. Ask for Omarr(tour guide) and Leonardo(the driver). It was a great experience!!!!!The bad stuff: Most of the eating is outside, which was a problem since it was very hot and humid with birds everywhere and bird poop on the chairs and tables. Look before you sit! The rooms were nice to look at, but the air-conditioning in the room was terrible! There was no where to go for cool air on the entire resort! The service is great if you are European or Caucasian American. Black Americans beware, the staff on the resort treat you like 2nd class citizens. They look like you, but they will treat you as if you are the poor.

<Content>Amazing wedding destination!!! My now wife and I travelled to the Iberostar Bavaro in April 2005 to be married and we haven't come down off the cloud since! Our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to our wonderful wedding coordinator Yadilis and Ricky the photographer! I have to say that we had our reservations intially because we were uncertain how the wedding would be without extensive planning. Trust me, there's no need to worry because everything is covered -- not to mention you can change half the things when you arrive anyhow! We got married in the garden for a more private, less breezy ceremony (you can always take pictures on the beach!) There were 12 of us all together and we were all satisfied. Quite the opposite of stuffy church/hall weddings back home, we were in the ocean within 20 minutes of finishing our pictures! Later that evening we had a lovely dinner at the specialty restaurant where we received our beautiful wedding cake and service second to none! The rooms are clean and spacious and are tended to and stocked to a T every day. Please bring some American ones ($) when you go to tip the staff -- a little goes a long way! We also brought toys and other inexpensive gifts (toiletries) for the maids who certainly accepted them for their families. Speaking of money, we left a portfolio at the restaurant the night before our wedding. it contained our wedding documents, return tickets to Halifax, and a substantial sum of money. As if our nerves weren't shot enough already! Despite a slight language barrier when we called guest services (our fault, we're in their country!) the portfolio was taken by restaurant staff the night before and waited for us at guest services -- with every cent accounted for. Food was great, absolutely no complaints. Specialty restaurants are all worth the booking and minimal effort. Beach is Beautiful, never seen anything like it! Poolside was a nice break from the beach (and closer to the drinks!) Check-in was a breeze and I find it hilarious that some find it excrutiating to have to wait for their room (which is still ready by the required time) at the pool/beach with a Bahama-Mama in their hand! My wife loved the Spa and we had a fun-filled night at the Casino. So much more good things to say than I have space for. Any questions about getting married there: ianayles@eastlink.ca

<Content>WONDERFUL!!!!!!! My husband decided to take me to Dominican Republic for our 25th wedding anniversary. And boy what a wonderful time we had. We booked through Apple Vacations. (Good Idea) We arrived at the Punta Cana airport, got our pictures taken with beautiful Dominican women, went through customs and imigrations with very little difficulity and found our Apple Rep right away. They walked us to the Apple bus and about 15 minutes later, we were on our way to the Iberostar Baravo. It took us about 35 minutes to get to the resort. We checked in, and got to our rooms, unpacked, got our swim suits on and were on the beach by 4:00pm that afternoon. The breeze was cool, the water blue, and green and the sand as white as snow. TERRIFIC!!!The Room was great. We were in Junior Suite # 2372. 1st row behind ocean front. Alot of people complained about the smell, flies, bugs, etc... absolutely not. Our room was clean and no oder. Whoever our maid was, she did a terriffic job. She worked around our schedule and we never saw her. We tipped her $3.00 everyday and our fridge was always filled with beer, pop, and water. She did a great job.We did also tip our bartenders, waiters, and waitresses $1.00 -$2.00 and you can tell how they appreciate that small amount.The food was awesome!!!!!! We had the best breakfast every morning. Omlets, waffles, pancakes, french toast, cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, fresh juices. WOW!!! We ate at 3 al acart restaruants. GREAT!!! Wednesday night is Lobster night at the lobby buffet. Terriffic!!!!You can do as little or as much as you want. You can be a beach bum all week or you can participate in beach volleyball, archery, water games, bingo, you name it, they got it. We were bums most of the week. We did however bring our own snorkle equipment and snorkled right off the beach. That was so much fun we went on the Marrinarium.  That was worth the $70.00 per person for a morning or afternoon of snorkling. Thank you Captain Sharkie. Swimming with the sharks and rays was quite the adventure. Make sure you bring your underwater camera.The shows at night were fun. After our evening meal, we would try a new drink by the lobby bar and sit and watch the entertainment. Very fun. They did a wonderful job. Had some good laughs.I cannot tell you how wonderful, friendly, loving, caring the employees at the IB were. One quick story. As our vacation started, I lost our cell phone on the bus to the airport and realized it once were were in flight. That was the scarriest feeling I had. I felt I had no way of contacting my two grown children once we were in the DR. I was really going nuts. We got to the Iberostar Bavar, talked to the girl at the front desk, and to my surprise she offered her personal cell phone to me for the week. I was speechless. We did get two calling cards for $10.00 each from the Apple Rep and I did contact my kids. But this just goes to show you how these wonderful people treat you and respect you.Don't worry about not speaking spanish. Most of the IB people spoke 3-5 languages. Made me feel kinda stupid.I guess the only down-fall of our vacation was coming back into the US. We went through customs in Atlanta. What a joke. The customs and imigrations people were rude, and I thought very unprofessional I was truly embarassed to be an American. The way they treated the visitors coming into the country that you could tell did not speak English. Yelling and screaming at they people, was sad This is not how we were treated at the Punta Cana Airport. Everything was explained in 5 languages and in a calm, friendly manner. In closing, I want to thank the Iberostar Baravo people. You made our 25th wedding anniversary an experience I will never forget. We are going back again and take our grown children with us. And for the people that read this review, take a chance, have a blast and try the Dominican Republic. You will not regret it.

<Content>Our family loved our week at Iberostar My family (wife, daughters age 20 and 17, and I) stayed at the Iberostar Bavarro in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic for the week of June 18 to June 25, 2006. We would like to share our experiences as we used Tripadvisor aggressively to plan this wonderful vacation. We live in Richmond, Virginia. We travel extensively; this was our fourth land trip out of the country with family members in addition to approximately 8 cruises. We wanted an all inclusive to have the opportunity to be together as a family, not have to make meal decisions three times a day for meals and to control the major costs of the vacation. We booked through a local travel agent. She had been to the resort before and highly recommended it. She knew of several other resorts both in DR and in the Mayan Riviera and felt that we could get better value in the Dominican Republic for the week we traveled. She booked an Apple package with airfare on USAIR. We chose to fly out of Washington Dulles Airport (IAD) instead of Richmond (RIC) to save several hundred dollars a person.Getting to DR was easy. We had an early Dulles flight to Charlotte and then an easy connection to Punta Cana. We were offered the opportunity to upgrade to first class on this second flight for $150 per person; we took it in a flash as a way to de-stress our vacation early. The seats were better and we had food. We were happy and rested when we arrived in Punta Cana.It was hot!!! and sunny and beautiful!!! The airport, customs and baggage issues were easy. We purchased our $10 tourist cards as trip advisor writers had told us to expect. We then met the Apple airport representative and got into a minivan with only one other couple for our trip to the Iberostar Bavarro. The ride took about twenty five minutes; the driving was scary-----just close your eyes.The resort is beautiful---lush landscaped grounds, white sandy beach, peacocks roaming the grass and jumping on the furniture. The first impression was outstanding. Then we met Felipe. He assigned us our rooms. We followed the map to a room in the 3500 section of the resort. Each of the buildings holds four junior suites; there are two on the ground floor and two on the second floor. We were assigned two rooms in the same building, one an downstairs back room overlooking not the gardens as we were promisedbut the Iberostar Dominicana resort. We saw mostly concrete and a large hotel like building. The upstairs room was on the front side of the building had a garden view, but had a strong odor of cleaning solution mixed with mold mixed with other un identifiable smells. We walked back to Felipe at the front desk, expressed our disappointment with the room and he told us to wait. We asked for a room nearer the beach and were told that none were available. After much persistence, positive attitude (if they could just get us into one of the rooms tonight, we would gladly accept the second room tomorrow) and patience, Rosa got us two rooms near the beach 1272 and 1276. These rooms are ourstanding. They are renovated, had no convincing odor and were one row off the beach. Now about the rest of the trip:The resort: beautiful, spacious. The staff are friendly and multi lingual. The English spoken was largely excellent. We participated in archery and shooting activities but little else organized at the resort. Some of the shows were good. The Chicago show was particularly bad鈥?all lip syncing. We had fun and spend a few nickels at the casino. Table games were $5 minimum which is better than you see in Vegas. There is no Craps table. We saw some of the administrative data on the slots when they had to pay me $400 on a slot payoff. It looks like they pay about 86 percent, which is reasonable for nickel slots. The food: Buffet---my comparison is cruise ship buffet. We have cruised with Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Princess and Norwegian. The food at Iberostar Bavarro is better than any cruise buffet The fruit is fresh; the breads are excellent. Breakfast and lunch were our favorites. Fine Dining: We ate at the Caribbean food restaurant (at a neighbor resort), the steak house and the fine dining restaurant. At the former two the appetizer buffet was great. The steaks were great, but the entress at the Tropical were tasteless. In the future we would only go to restaurants on the Bavarro property. We had our last meal at the fine dining restaurant----the food and service were excellent. I had lamb chops, my daughter had filet mignon.The beverages: The local beer was good. Name brand alcohol was available at the fine dining restaurant, at the casino and at the main bar. It was good. There is no name brand beer available. We did not see any drinking games or other pushes for drunkenness, yet if you needed a drink there was always a server available to help you get one. My favorite place was the pool bar鈥?cool and in the shade. Bottled water was in the room; we checked the seals on every bottle. We also drank tap water at the meals---probably something we would not do again. The activities:The beach was great. On sunny days we hung out there in the shade of one of the thatched umbrellas or in the sun. There is a bar nearby for soft drinks or other. The water was warm. You could stroll down the beach and buy items from local vendors; we made this walk once but did not buy anything. Carlos and Petra from Apple Vacations did a great job in organizing our ground transport and our excursions. We bought all of our excursions from them. The best was the Quad trip. It was combination 4 wheeling and swimming. The scenery was fantastic. We also went to the Marinarium and on the Kon Tiki party boat. The snorkeling on the party boat was fantastic. At the Marinarium we got to see nurse sharks and sting rays. On each trip the guides spoke great English, were very professional and very concerned about our safety and fun. We felt comfortable with our daughters on all of these trips. We would do them all again. 鈥andom thoughts: The safe in the room worked well and we used it aggressively. 鈥e brought $300 in US one dollar bills and used them for tips in the bars and dining rooms. We thought this was a good idea.鈥ou should see your internist or gastroenterologist before you travel to get Cipro or Xifaxin for travelers鈥?diarrhea. You should expect to get diarrhea on a trip like this to a developing nation. Our antibiotics served us well. Our departure was somewhat more eventful. Our driver did not show up and Petra and Carlos had to scramble to get someone to take us to the airport. Once we got there everything was fine, but the ride there was more like a NASCAR race than a taxi ride. We will definitely go back to this resort.

<Content>Nice Place, Poorly Maintained Hotel, Unresponsive Management My girlfriend and I visited the Bavaro the last week in May 2006. First of all, let me caution any person who wants to travel to Punta Cana in May. IT IS EXTREMELY HUMID  HOT!!! I had to take naps everyday in the afternoon. :-) However, I would encourage anyone to visit the DR because the Dominican people are beautiful, jovial and just plain fun. They were very down-to-earth and friendly. The staff was so beautiful and friendly. I haven't met such personable, spirited wait staff and front desk staff on any other vacation. Finally, the beaches are absolutely georgeous. You don't need water shoes at all because the sand is so soft, and the beaches aren't rocky at all. However, overall, I would not encourage any person to stay at the Bavaro. Considering the price, you will not receive a good value. At one time, this property rated 5 stars, but at the present time, the Bavaro is the equivalent of an Econo Lodge, Motel 6 or other budget hotel. The only feature that remotely qualified this property as a 5-star hotel is the fact that its an all-suite hotel and the fact that they serve lobster on Wednesday nights. The hotel's maintenance, the drinks, the pools and the management need much improvement. We expected the Bavaro to be as nice as the Paraiso Maya in Riviera Maya, where we stayed last year. The Bavaro PALES in comparison.The ROOMFirst, the furniture is old and rickety. While the walls are beautifully painted, the furnishings are barely standing. We had to have the bed repaired the first day we arrived, and the shower head barely shot out enough water to wet my hair. The living area couches are pretty small and uncomfortable. All the bathroom fixtures reminded me of those one would find in a hootie-scootie motel. The airconditioner was on its last leg, and sometimes, we wondered whether it was working at all. Worst of all, we had insect problems in BOTH rooms we tried. The first room we had was located directly on the beach on the first floor, but the ROACHES had driven us crazy by the second day. So, we had to repack everything to relocate to a second floor room near the pool only to find MORE ANTS AND TINY BROWN BUGS there. More minor inconveniences included: 1. No alarm clocks. 2. Inaccessible plugs for the coffee maker. We couldn't plug in the coffee maker because the cord was very short. But, even if it were longer, the nearest plug was hidden behind the minifridge. Needless to say, we didn't use the coffee maker at all. 3. It wasn't easy to turn the lights on without turning something else off. I need everything to be EASY on vacation. The POOLThe hotel features a lake pool that is about 4 feet deep in most parts, and in one section the pool may be about 6 feet deep. The problem is that the pool is a lake pool so it is EXTREMELY shallow (about 3.5 ft) in most parts accept the middle. I love to immerse my whole body in water, and at 5'6, it was difficult to do. So, I walked on my knees through most of the pool. The area deep enough to immerse your shoulders is close to an inflatable, floating mountain, which was great for kids. But, by the time you swam through 6 feet of water, you were below the inflatable mountain. Logistically, swimming without fear of a kid crashing down on you was not an option. I'd suggest using the Dominicana's pool. It's deep enough, nicely landscaped and roomy enough for everyone. Also, we got grossed out a couple of times because we encountered hair and debris in the pool. There are plenty of lounge chairs so you don't need to get up early to fight for one. The BARSThe Bavaro's swim-up bar was understaffed, and they had two bartenders servicing both the swim up bar and the pool buffet bar, which are connected. So, people were on top of each other waiting for drinks. It was very inconvenient. Additionally, I never saw any staff member carrying drinks to any patron sunning around the pool. THERE IS NO BAR CLOSE TO THE BEACH!!! :-(Also, this 5-star property had no international liquors. All we could drink was rum and more rum. No Jose Cuervo. No Hennessy. No Absolut. And, the mixers were very, very, very sweet. After a while, all I could drink was a shot of no-name Tequila and Presidente beer. The Miami Vices have a horrible lime flavor with a horrible after taste. Ugh. PACE YOURSELVES ON THE COCO LOCOS. They are delcious, but they contain coconut milk, which is extremely hard to digest -- even for the locals. If you're trying to cleanse yourselves, drink 3 in one day. The MANAGEMENTThe Iberostar clearly employs a lot of managers and supervisors. You see them strolling, golf-cart riding or just plain lounging A LOT. But, for all this management, the customer service was lacking. We made three complaints about the bugs in our room before we finally demanded to relocate. When we relocated from our first floor room to our second floor room, we carried our own bags up to the second floor. The supervisor who escorted us to our second-floor room did not arrange for anyone to carry our luggage, which was the least they could do. After all, we weren't relocating because we didn't like the view. We were relocating because we had ROACHES in our room. When we returned we complained to Iberostar about our experience, and they showed no concern at all for our inconvenience.The FOODThe food is delicious although I did have an upset stomach for most of the trip. LOBSTER NIGHT IS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT THE BUFFET!!!! IT'S ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!! DON'T MISS IT!!!!!! The restaraunts offerred the best food I've ever had on a vacation. Try the Steakhouse, the Mediterranean (seafood) and Cajun restaraunts. They're ALL GOOD!!!The ENTERTAINMENTThe shows were corny but fun. We had a great time dancing, singing and laughing. And, Johanna was very motivational during water aerobics. :-) Also, learn the Bachata! It's a lot of fun!

<Content>Awesome!!!!!!!!!!! Hi. Here is a totally honest review. We (husband, wife and 6 year old) stayed here June 24 to June 30, 2006. Had a great time!! The food is pretty much the same everyday at the buffets but it also really good. Can always find something for everyone. We ate at the Steak House 2 nights. Don't know what everyone else is talking about but it was wonderful. The steak was done to our liking. The servers are so genuine. They do really sing and dance all the time, even out of guests' sight. We tried the white wine and it was really good. Do watch out for the mixed slushy drinks with alcohol as they can be a little disruptive to the stomach (you know what I mean). The lunch buffet by the pool was very good. Always a good selection everyday. They had chicken nuggets, pork chops, steak, veal, fish and even lobster with jambalaya. Went to Cancun last year and wasn't sure what we were eating. This place is very good and we did know what we were eating. Kids club was excellent for our 6 year old. Laly and Keyla worked very hard every day and made sure she was comfortable and enjoying herself. She made a lot of little friends there. (Hi Caleb and Isa). The beach is beautiful. There were ALWAYS palapas available no matter what time of day it was. Pool was very clean and warm. They closed it at 7pm every night to clean it. We brought coloring books, crayons, and playdoh for the maid as well as a daily tip of $2.00. She did a great job. We always had beer, pop, and water stocked on a daily basis. The seal was not broken. We never got sick. We are already planning next year's return trip in June. You will certainly miss out if you decide not to come here. Your loss. We did check out the Dominicana and Punta Cana resorts, glad we stayed here at the Bavaro. Way too crowded over there and definitely a younger crowd. (We're only 37). Much calmer here. See you next year in June!! Hope this helps someone.

<Content>La Romana Iberostar is much better!!!! We stayed at the Iberostar Hacienda Domincus in La Romana two years ago. I must say that it is way better than Iberostar Bavaro. La Romana is newer and what they did wrong in Punta Cana, they did right in La Romana. The only the exceptions being the cheezy casino and a teeny bit more nightlife at the Bavaro. Don't get me wrong, Iberostar knows how to do it right. You can't go wrong with either Iberostar, but the one in La Romana is better with no musty smells. I agree with that last post. ITs been two months and my husband's t-shirts still smell musty like the room. I emailed the resort before I left and mentioned that we were returning customers and requests a room in a central location having heard that the resort is huge (3 resorts - get your walking shoes on!) We ended up in a room next the construction zone on the far southern end. We were close to the beach bar though, which I must say was wonderful. The bartenders were very cool. It is a beautiful resort and DR is an excellent value, but next time, I'm going back to La Romana!!!

<Content>It was just okay My boyfriend and I visited the Iberostar Bavaro back in April. For starters, we arrived at the hotel at about noon and didn't get into our room until about 3pm or so and with no place to get relief from the heat, we weren't happy campers. The rooms were okay, but were did find ants quite often. The Birds, well they drive you crazy after awhile. At first they are beautiful to look at, but listening to them make noise all day long, they drive you nuts. They especially liked out patio because every morning we were woken up by a flock out our door. Now lets get to food...it was ok. If you have a week stomach, it's not for you! The breakfast buffet is the same stuff everyday and you have to fight off the Europeans because they are rude and walk right infront of you. Lunch, again the buffet is the same everyday. And if you like salads with your meals, don't plan on getting a good one. Dinner, the Japanese was best I think. You do have to make reservations and they only gaurentee a certain number depending on the number of nights you are staying.All in all, the beach was absoulutely beautiful and I would definately go back to Punta Cana BUT NOT TO THE IBERO STAR. They staff was nice and friendly, but I must let you all know...I have yet to get the musty smell out of my suitcases and 2 and a half months later, I have finally been able to get the smell out of my clothes. So be prepared for the musty smell to stick around when you get home.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro: Everything and a whole lot more !!!! My wife, 2 children age 14, and 5 others just returned from the D.R. on the 26th of June, after 8 wonderful days. We had our reservations about this place after reading some negative reviews. Don't give it a second thought. Every person, place and thing about this resort is fantastic. From the moment we boarded our bus from the airport to our resort, we were in quite capable hands. We had requested rooms near the beach that had been renovated, and got exactly what we asked for. Spacious, clean, and beautiful. Grounds are beautiful, pool large and immaculately cleaned every morning and night. The food was better than expected, huge variety. Formal restaurants were each unique, and well worth trying as many as you can. My wife and were amazed at how hard the Dominican people work, and the pride they take in their jobs. Which I might add, change all the time. Our waiter at the buffet for breakfast, might turn out to be the Maitre de at the fromal dining room that same night. Always smiling, singing, and dancing, and always seemed genuine, not just a put on for the guests. Do yourselves and the Dominican people a favor, respect the work and effort they put in to making this place and your stay a fabulous one, stay light hearted, be patient, and you should have yourself the vacation of a lifetime. We sure did. There are many more Europeans there than Americans, but that really added to the cultural experience this trip should be. The only loud, unruly behavior we encountered came from Americans and their misbehaving children. Again, respect the effort that goes in to this resort by people who have far less than we do, and you will no doubt cherish your time spent there. Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have. Can't wait to go back!!!!

<Content>The greatest time of my life This is the second time I stayed at this resort. Once in Oct. it was wonderful, but it rained alot. Will not recommend that month.Now in June we had the greatest weather. We stayed June 5-16. We got married right on the beach on June 10,2006. It was the most romantic,beautiful, and breath taking wedding ever. They did a unbelievable job. It was perfect. Raizia and Kathy were amazing. We had 55 guests. They did so much for us. Our rooms were so clean everyday. Everyone at the resort was so friendly. They even remembered us from last time. They had alittle party for us because we came back which was so nice. They food was great! The french restaurant was the best! THe beef tenderlion and lobster salad was off the hook! You do have to make reservations in advanced because you will be eating buffet evey nite. But even though they are booked. Go to guest services later that day because there might be cancellations. THere wines are very good.  The lobby bar had the best drinks. The monkey lunch was the best. The beach bar was so much fun. Santana and Leonardo was the best. Santana made us the best fries and grilled cheese. Wish we could of took them home with us.  The staff was great. Tried to get us to have a good time. We did have 55 people with us so it was crazy. The casino was fun. Just watch your cards. Black jack is not like the states. Cards fly off the table and they still use them. Dealers can't count either. THe club was fun. Just the same music every nite. THe golf cart took us there from the bavaro to the dominicana. You just wait in the front lobby and they will pick you up. THe rock cafe was good. That place was air conditioned well. Got to see some of the games on tv. They did karoke if you like to.  THey have a cigar louge also. Nice cigars. They hand role for you to.I really can't say one bad thing about the resort. I do wish they had waitress service by the pool for drinks. You do have to get your own drinks by the pool and the beach. We made tons of friends. THe beach was the most beautiful I ever saw. Love the calm water. The grounds are just gorgous at the resort. The wildlife is beautiful. They do not bother you at all. ( peacocks, flamingos,etc.) OUr photographer was ricky. He goes around and takes pictures of guests with monkeys, parrots, snakes etc. He is great. We did go with apple vacations. Apple was great. We flew USA300 airline was fine. They gave us a bottle of champage on our way there because we were getting married. I did book with a travel agent Just Travel in Clifton, NJ. Kathy was terrible. Gave us alot of problems. Next time will book with Apple direct. I would have did better with them. Alot of less headaches. We gave her 55 people and she could not help us. I basically did all the work and all my guest complain. So my advice never use Just Travel and book with apple directly. Cheaper that way to. No one got sick but use bottled water to brush your teeth. Try not to drink to many pina coladas they said it could be use laxitive. Some people had that problem. Sun is strong use sunscreen. So I would highly recomend this resort for everyone! Everyone can not wait to go back next year for our 1st anniversay!!! Anyone can join us! So Iberostar Bavaro here we come!! AGAIN. Will never forget our wedding and honeymoon we will have memories forever. It lasted a whole 12 days instead on 1day. I will highly recommend it to anyone!! It was a dream come true and we had the people we love with us. One big party!

<Content>Gret Review  I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro June 15-22 with my Mother as a relaxing getaway. Neither of us had previously stayed at an Iberostar. I have stayed at a Riu in Mexico, and my Mother has stayed at a number of all-inclusive resorts. We both agree that it is a great place to stay. You may read that there are 11 restaurants to choose from. This is a gross overstatement. There are 2 buffets from which to choose for lunch, one for dinner and breakfast. However, you are alotted three meals at their specialty restaurants. They fill up quickly so it is important to reserve ASAP. We ate at the French, Japanase, Meditteranean and Steakhouse. You are permitted to ask the Customer service desk if there have been any cancellations after 3:00 daily. My Mother and I loved these restaurants. The Japanese apetizers, however, were better than the meals we chose. Also, I do not like seafood but thoroughly enjoyed the red snapper I ordered at the Meditteranean. Apart from the specialty restaurants, the food is decent, but there is enough to choose from for pretty much any picky eater out there. My Mother said the food doesn't compare to Sandals but she really enjoyed the specialty restaurants. There are 3 Iberostar hotels in a row. The Punta Cana and Dominicana can share each other's facilities, but not that of the Bavaro. And of course, those staying at the Bavaro can enjoy their facilities, though I saw little need to leave the grounds. The entertainment is the same at all resorts, though Dominicana has a small casino. You should know that there is quite a bit of construction going on at the moment. It starts early in the morning and well into the evening. It would be wise to ask for a room away from the noise. We did not feel the need to tip, except on our last day. In fact, I never once saw anyone tip though from what I had read in the reviews, some people do. A little tip goes a long way with this staff. Remember that the Dominican Republic shares this Island with Haiti. The pool is gorgeous but gets very loud with activities and a DJ in the afternoon. However, there are always enough palapas (shaded umbrellas and lounges) on the beach and the noise is not bad from many areas on the beach.  The beach, by the way, is unbelievable. The sand is like nothing we had seen before. It's so fine that you cannot even brush it off most of the time. The water is perfect for swimming, but too wavy for snorkeling. If you want to snorkel, you should take a trip. We went on a half-day trip to the Marinarium and swam with nurse sharks and rays. It was great, but what they don't tell you is that much more time is spent partying than snorkeling. The grounds are beautiful and clean. There are loud peacocks hanging around and many people were fortunate enough to see a mating ritual. Eating at the buffet is great- flamingos, ducks, geese and birds all wait for a taste of your food.  GOOD TIPS- be sure to ask for the safe key when you check in, as the key activates the safe (which relies on a code). Internet is available at the Dominicana, but you buy your password at the Bavaro front desk. Pepto Bismol costs more than gold, so you may want to bring your own. Apparently the information package has typos, though I didn't notice any. The hair dryers are fine, but not great. If you have a lot of hair and care what it looks like, bring your own. There is no hair conditioner either. Another missing item is an alarm clock. However, they do offer wake-up calls (we had three in one morning for some reason). Someone in a review suggested that we bring a pool raft and mugs for drinks. We did and never used them. The slushy type drinks at the bars contain no alcohol so you must ask for it to be mixed with something. Go easy on the Coco Loco, since the milk might not agree with your stomach. Also, my Mother's credit card did not work for long distance calls and the operator could not tells us why. Mine worked just fine. So maybe it is an option you must select for your credit card? I don't know, but you may want to bring an extra card, just in case. Finally, DUH - don't drink the tap water. I just read a negative review regarding the lack of AC in the buildings. Well, yes it is VERY hot, but the breeze is great (more so at the beach than the pool). These buildings are open-concept, rustic meets elegance, and I think most tourists would appreciate that. Not to mention the environmental effects as well as financial costs to the Island. The facilities in your room (AC, lights, etc) turn off with the motion sensor when you are not in your room so it is good to turn it up sometimes. You would think it would turn off at night, but my Mother and I never once had a problem with that.  I hope this information has helped. I wrote what I was looking for before I went. I know this sounds totally ridiculous, but if you go and happen to see a server named Ronald Leon (everyone's best friend with the huge smile). PLEASE tell him Alexis (from Canada) says hello. He'll know who you're talking about. ENJOY! I know I did! If you have questions, you can email me. I will try to get back to you in a timely manner.

<Content>Relaxing vacation with small children My husband and three children and my in -laws enjoyed our stay at this resort.The hospitality of the Dominicans is great.I was happy to see how friendly they were with our kids even with my child with disabilities..The babysitters kept telling us about the activities with the children so they could join them.The children practiced a play every day and put up a show in the evening for everybody to see.Be really aware of the tour guys .They will tell you anything in order to sell their tours. We took the Kontiki Calipso snorkling tour/Party boat.We were totally disapointed.Is not a tour for families with small children.They won't stop their trip even if they see rain coming.My child was terrified to take a small boat to board the big boat off shore.Snorkling is not that good.Waste of your money.Cheap entertaintment, the crew really try to pleased but nothing helped with my terrified child . the rain was poring and we had to get off down the old ladder to board the small boat in the middle of the storm.One of the crew ladies was dancing around and jumped into my 73 years old father in law's arms for him to catch her.She hurted his back.Ruied his trip.As for the hotel I strongly recomended.Ask for renovated rooms.We had three rooms for everybody.Some of them even if they have been renovated have no showers doors yet just a plastic curtain.But overall we were very satisfied with our stay.

<Content>a long awaited disapointment ME and my wife vacationed at the Iberostar Bavaro June4-12 and were very disappointed. We had stayed at the Iberostar Lindo in Mexico and the Bavaro was not half the resort of the Lindo. First of all the only airconditioning was in your room. All Bars and Restuarants have no AC. This can creat a problem when it is 95 degrees all day and 85 degrees at night. There is no relief from the heat to enjoy any other activities or entertainment. There is also no real Lobby Bar, it is part of the Show Place. Again no AC and not anything special. The food was fair if you could fight the Germans off, they act like every meal is there last. The Beach was Beautiful and so was the staff at the Beach Bar. Thank God for some things.

<Content>Paradise beyond words My husband, teenage daughter, mother, sister and brother-in-law just spent an amazing week at the Bavaro. May 2l - May 28. Please do not listen to the bad reviews. The place was beautiful. Grounds were immaculate with peacocks and flamingos everywhere. They walked the grounds all over. The food by far was better then the food we have ever had at the resorts we have stayed at in Mexico. The beach is unbelievable. They were always cooking something different everyday out at the pool grill. The people who worked there were so friendly and always helpful. Never really had any problem understanding what they were saying and none of us speak Spanish. Our waiter in the buffet (Fermin) was always welcoming us with open arms. We ate in three specialty restaurants, the Japanese, the Steak House and the Romantic dinner at the French Restaurant. All of them were excellent with excellent service. The one nite we opted for American food and went to The Star Rock Cafe. Try the Grouper there. Raved about it all nite. They say to bring insulated cups with you. Bad mistake, the drinks were so strong and cups so big, they did us in pretty fast. After the 2nd day we stuck to the glasses that they served the drinks in.The swim up bar always was a blast in the afternoons. Lots of drinking and partying going on there. Went there everyday. Try the Mama Wamas. Brought some of that home with us. Weather picture perfect everyday not a cloud in the sky even though the reports I had looked at online were for rain. The entertainment staff put on wonderful shows. They really work hard at what they do. Went to shows everynite and then hit the casino. Casino small. Lost but not big. The rooms need a little renovatiing and they are in the process of doing that. They were working on them everyday. Our room was fine, had a little problem with toliet not flushing but they came right away and it seemed to work better. By the 6th nite air conditioning didnt seem as cool but never really bothered us. Never in the room. We are already planning our trip back to the same place next year. We loved it and highly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>The Beach and hotel were wonderful We stayed at the hotel from 5/21 - 5/28. It was hotter than I expected - 95-97 everyday and humid, but we made it through ok. The hotel is beautiful. We stayed in rm 1324 - and it was right near the construction - but it wasn't a problem. (The room had been renovated and that's the way you want to go. It was our first request when we made the reservation - an updated room. No smells, everything worked - it was just wonderful.) They don't work very late and did not start early in the morning. It was a great room with quick access to the pool and beach.The guys at the beach bar were awesome. Great french fries! FYI - bring an insulated mug for drinks. They will fill it up and or rinse it out - no problems. It keeps your drink cold and the sand out. The food at the hotel was average in my opinion. The buffet for breakfast was the best. The wildlife at this hotel is amazing. 50 peacocks on property roamin freely. Don't worry - they don't want anything to do with people . . .Even saw a female with babies. Speaking of babies - many of the ducks had babies and were looking for some bread - so make sure to feed them. Flamingoes that would eat right out of your hands - very gentle.We took 2 trips through the Liberty Travel Desk. Both were over priced, but if you want to get out to see the island - this is the only way. DO NOT VENTURE OUT ON YOUR OWN. It's not worth it. 1 of our tours was 1/2 day on a boat that went snorkeling, and also swimming withe the sharks/stingrays. It was not big deal. They didn't want anything to do with us. Then onto a shallow area - waist deep - for some easy swimming/drinking. It was mostly a party boat and I would not recommend it for children. The other tour was to swim with the dolphins. Do not do this one. Too expensive and primitive. If I had known they only had 2 dolphin and worked them all day I never would have gone. It's just not right.No security risks - felt very safe and comfortable. Remember that you get 1 hour of snorkeling and kayaking and sailing per person per day - but book the catamarans early. They go fast.Overall, I was very happy with this vacation. They mean it when they say that the Dominican People are happy to have you there and are very friendly. They will always say good morning - buenos dias . . .and thank you - donnata.Any questions - just email me at janeenbaker@yahoo.com

<Content>Fantastic Vacation Resort We just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro Suites and return in a heart beat! This is the 4th all-inclusive resort that we've stayed at (in Mexico: Bahia Principe, Occidental Allegro, and Paradisus). This resort is overall at the top of our list. The beach is beautiful - the palm trees, white sand, crystal blue water. The food was excellent. Out of all of the resorts that we've stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro consistently had the best food for the buffets and the restaurants. I always read these reviews and everyone tends to say how horrible the food is - you have to take the food for what it is, there were plenty of items there that we tried and didn't like, (personal preferences) but at the same time there was more that we did like. We had a group of 5 and were all completely stuffed after every meal. The resort staff was nice and accomodating - all of the staff would say hello anytime you passed them. We had an issue with our shower and maintenance came to our room within 15 minutes and fixed the problem. We took the ATV tour and really had a good time - they take you to a beautiful beach! The casino was okay (it is on the property next door). On Friday and Saturday night they only had 3 black jack tables open. We had to wait a bit to get on a tables - there really weren't that many people in there. The dealers were good - they knew what they were doing.Again - out of all of the resorts that we've stayed at - this is definitely the best one we've stayed at so far.

<Content>Awesome Trip, Want to go back!! Whats going on, I checked this site like everyday before I left for my trip to here, so I figured I should do this for anyone else who is doing the same thing... My girlfriend and I (in our mid-20's) just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro Suites. We were there from 5/21/06-5/26/06. Here is my review:ROOM: Was awesome. Clean. No Ants. No Bugs. No funky smells. Bathroom was really nice and clean.BEACH: Amazing. Enough said.FOOD: Different, but I am probably the pickiest person in the world (my food list includes probably Mac n' cheese, peanut butter toast sandwhiches, and pizza) and I actually went out on a limb and tried a lot of there food and love it all.STAFF: Nicest people in the world. They all know like 5 different languages.OTHER VISITORS: We are both American, but I felt like we were the minority. There were many many germans and french people. I played many volleyball games on the beach and it was amusing trying to communite with everyone. Things to note: The water from the tap and shower head is not good. Try to get as little as possible in your mouth. Also, the bottled water is deciving. It says ALASKA so you think that it is from Alaska, and you drink it and drink it til you feel sick. I looked at the bottle closely and in fine print it says that it is bottled in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and a Company under the name Alaska, S.A. is purifying and bottling it. Once I saw that, I stopped drinking the water and bought Gatorade at the store for the minifridge. Also, the ride from the Airport to the hotel can be quite nerve racking. The driver and other drivers are crazy. You go to put on a seatbelt and guess what! there aren't any. Try your best not to look out the windshield and pray you get there. Other than those few minor issues, the hotel was amazing, the beach was awesome, and the water.... I want to GO BACK!!!! You'll love it.

<Content>Great time 5/14 - 22 Just got back Mon., 5/22 from eight days at the Bavaro. I would have written this review earlier but I had some bad stomach problems the day after I got back. I was so careful about not drinking the tap water too. Must have been something else.Got two out of three on the room request. Asked for a king size bed (got it), close to the beach (couldn鈥檛 get a building any closer) and second floor (got a ground floor room) Oh well, a bottle of rum and a fruit plate awaited my arrival.Met up with my buddy Huck, formerly of the Lindo. We a had a long talk over a few beers one evening. That鈥檚 another long story though.Food - Only had dinner at the buffet three of the eight nights. Plenty of variety, probably better then the Lindo. Had dinner at the Star Rock while watching a Spurs-Mavericks game. The Cajun - great - love the blackened grouper. Japanese - pretty good - though I miss the cooking right in front of you like at the Maya. Both these restaurants are air conditioned. Steakhouse - hardly anyone was there, just okay. The last night was a special dinner by invite only. Starfriends invited maybe two hundred (?) people to a steak  lobster dinner. Course after dinner someone passed out questionnaires. They were being audited or reviewed (whatever). I asked Huck if it was just a coincidence that certain people were invited and they were being reviewed and he just laughed. Works for me.Room - Bed was perfect. Who says they are too hard? Course when you don鈥檛 get into it until 1am or so.... No little black ants or any other kind of bugs.Safe - You need to request a key for it when you check in. They didn鈥檛 tell me. It works just like the one at the Lindo I remember but requires a key on the inside to activate.Entertainment - The dancers put on a heck of a show, especially considering the postage stamp size of the stage. You won鈥檛 see them anywhere else though. They do the show, dance with guests for a prescribed period of time after, then make a grand exit. The animation team, the ones doing the activities during the day, handle the other three or four shows a week. These are the Starfriends you鈥檙e apt to meet  get to know.Language - If you speak French or Spanish you鈥檙e fine. If only English, you鈥檒l have a problem carrying on a conversation. I needed help with one of the girls at the guest services desk. Guess I talked to fast. Bartenders speak a little bit of four languages but not all the Starfriends.There was a private cocktail one evening for frequent Iberostar guests. Had a chance to talk with the manager for a few minutes. A group photo as taken and we got a couple of t-shirts. Great, I have one for almost everyday of the week now.Beach/Pool - everyone else has already said it. Great!Excursions - don鈥檛 ask, I didn鈥檛 go on any and there is no where to go on your own off the property. It is not like the Riviera Maya.Size of property - I think I did a lot more walking at the Bavaro then I ever did at the Lindo. It is really spread out. They will be adding another in the vacant lot next door in a couple years too.Weather - rained pretty good one day - for five minutes, but the humidity!! I had to wipe off my glasses everytime I walked out of the room.Only real negative was the company handling my transportation to and from the airport, but that had nothing to do with the Bavaro. Will I go back? Sure will!Jim

<Content>Best kept Secret in the Atalntic First off I want to say to everyone out there that not everyone has a great vacation in Paradise. So please read each inviduals experience with an open mind. as for us..The Iberostar Bavaro was a wonderful experience and My wife and I had the time of our life. We was there from 14 May 2006 to 20 May 2006. The food was excellent, the staff was great and the rooms were just right. We experienced no bugs, no peacock problems and we always had fresh towels from our maid. Everyday we had a bulliten under our door with cool and intriguing events for that day.The pool was only cold at 0800 in the morning (no kidding right, come from a air condition room to a pool that early in morning what do you expect) at around 10:00 o clock the temp was around 89-90 degrees, and the cool pool water felt great. Huge pool, never crowded the swim up bar was excellent, the buffets had anything you can imagine. The resteraunts (reservation only) were fabulous. We got 3 reservations for the La Gourmet, The Mediterannian, and the La Cajun. Not a fan of that type of food however I loved all three. Met very nice people from New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, however most people were European. The staff was great, at the bar some of the bartenders would remember you and know exactly what you wanted (depends on how frequent you visit the bar as well) We did one extra excursion, the James Bond tour which was fun. it was a little more than half a day it involved driving a two person speedboat and snorkling. the guides were very friendly and very helpful. Pay no attention to the weather stations or websites with Punta Cana weather they always say cloudy and a chance of rain....never a problem. Beer..was ok, never saw any miller or budwieser just Bohemiam especial and El Presidente. The furity tooty drinks were great, Everything has rum in it...Believe it or not it is set up great for kids, we did not take ours but when we go back we will. Shows were great, the beach was like nothing in the states and the Ocean was swimming pool blue, very very pretty. The beach is topless but most of the women are old European women who should probably think about leaving them on. The ride from the airport is about 45 minutes and is very eye opening to how they drive, which is scary and even a little exciting. it is also very sad to see how the Domincans live. It is poor and very run down. So folks when you see this and then you get to your beautiful resort think before you complain about food and some of the conditions, you are visitor in thier country and have it better than the natives who live there and bust thier rump to make sure you have a nice time. Over all on a scale from 1-10 it is a 11. Enjoy

<Content>please read!!!!! My husband and I just returned from the Dominican. I do not normally write reviews but thought it was time to share some much needed information to those of you travelling to Iberostar Bavaro.I will make this short and sweet!The food in the buffet was ok. just ok. if you plan on eating in any of the restaurants you have to make your reservations for all days there on the day you arrive otherwise you will being eating at the buffet your entire trip!the beach is topless so no surprises when you arrive. I was surprised!I do not suggest you leave the resort!!!!!!!!!!!brush up on your spanish!!!!!!!!!!! my husband is fluent and without him I would have been lost!the air conditioning in the room shuts off when you leave the room. there is a sonsor! also, the fridge shuts off! use a coat hanger and hang a towl or tee shirt from the fan, this will make the sensor think there is someone in the room and keep the ac and fridge running!

<Content>Best Vacation Ever!! My husband and i had decided that were were in dire need of a of a well deserved vacation so we began our research. Now, I am a total beach person and hubby is a diver so we needed to find a resort that would suit us both. We had originally booked an all inclusive in Mexico but Wilma decided that was not to be so our second choice was Punta Cana . We chose The Bavaro mainly due to the great reviews it recieves. I am happy to say our second choice was an excellent one.We travelled by skyservice so we know how cramped the seats can be. We went to the airport early in hope that we might be able to snag the exit seats and lo and behold. we got them. What a difference it makes, all the leg room you could possibly need . I would recommend anyone getting out of bed an hour or so earlier so they might be able to have these seats. A 7 hour airplane ride can be pretty uncomfortable if you don't luck into these seats. We arrived into the Punta Cana airport at approx. 5:30 p.m. They will take your picture with some of the locals in costume (I believe that for 7 or 8 dollars you can purchase them on your return trip home.) We then proceeded to find our bags and then the bus that would take us to the resort. When you turn the corner that leads you to the buses, there will be about 50 or so men with carts waiting to help you and your luggage . If you don't want help then keep your head down and don't make eye contact. They are not pushy they will just go on the the next person. We found our bus no problem and off we went. It's about a 45 minute drive to the resort but I have to say driving through the towns to get there was a huge eye opener. Suffice to say, the bus driver deserves a pretty hefy tip just for getting you there in one piece!We arrived at the resort at 7:00 and checked in which was a breeze by the way. We left our bags in the lobby as they were going to be delivered and we set out to find our room. The resort itself is not too big and all the areas are well marked so it is very easy to find your way around. By the time we walked over to where we would be staying for the next 2 weeks our bags were already waiting for us. The room was just as we knew it would be from all the pictures posted on this site . I did a quick check for bugs because well, I have a huge aversion to them and was happy to see that there were none to be found. What I did find was an extremly clean room with a nice fruit plate and bottle of rum waiting for us . Nice touch.We didn't do or see too much that first night because by the time we were settled it was dark so we went to the lobby bar , had a couple of drinks and turned in for the night. We both found the beds to be comfortable and I for one slept like a log. My husband could sleep on top of a moving freight train so sleeping for him was no problem either.We are early risers so when the buffet opened at 7:00 am , we found a table (we sat at the same one for the whole 2 weeks ) Now, I am not normally a breakfast person, I have my morning coffee and off the work I go. But ... I walked into the buffet and my first thought was, so much food ... so little time ! The breakfast buffet is just wonderful . There was fruit, poached eggs, bacon, pan fried potatoes, waffles, pancakes, all different cheeses, sausages, every type of bun or bread that you can imagine, cereals french toast, hot oatmeal, yogurt of every type, and of course the infamous omlet station. My hubby opted for the omlets which he said were terrific. Me? I loved the scrambled eggs , bacon, french toast and whatever else hit my plate. All in all, a really excellent breakfast buffet.Time to find the beach... we went back to our room , quickly changed into our bathing suits and set off to explore the beach and find the dive shop. We found both within a very short time. The beach is stunning! The water is a beautiful blue and when entering , the water was so warm and the waves were huge (it was very windy that day) . I don't weigh much and didn't really realize how strong the waves were. Well, one picked me up and dropped me to the sand (which incidently feels like cement when you are slammed into it) I landed on my tailbone and hobbled around for the next couple of days but no real harm done. Just remember to plant your feet firmly and you should be okay. A lesson learned.Dressel divers is at the end of the resort, just follow the red flag. My hubby booked his dives but it was too windy for the first 4 days to go so he was a little disappointed and we really couldn't sit at the beach because the wind was so strong so we opted to lay around the pool. The pool is great. It was really cold but very refreshing when you need to cool off. Every day at the beach buffet they prepared a great lunch for all. There was usually a special item they cooked on the grill (one day huge shrimp, the next kibobs, the next ribs and so on) but for the most part, the usual consisted of all type of salads, burgers, pizza, fries, and foods of that type. I must say the chicken that they cook is just terrific. They also have an ice cream machine , a nacho station, and just outside the buffet they have an italian ice cream hut. There really wasn't anything that they lacked. Just a small note on the drinks, we are not huge drinkers but I did manage to down a few of their fruit drinks (banana daquiris and a drink that they call a monkey's lounge not lunch) . I would go back just for that reason alone. All made with fresh fruit and blended.. just delicious. In the two weeks were were there, we chose 2 excersions to go on both purchased through Dressel Divers. Catalina Island and Saona Island. The reason we chose these were for the scuba diving. I dont snorkel or dive but because they are lenghty (12 hours) i went along to keep my hubby company. On both of them you take a 2 hour bus ride to another Iberostar in La Romana (the other side of the island) get on a boat and go. On both of them you snorkel and dive then go to the Island and have a lunch (which was pretty good) and then snorkel and dive again. My husband said the diving was much better on the Catalina excursion . Me? I like the Saona because of the Island itself. The hammocks are great. I ate lunch and proceeded to have myself a little nap in one of them. On the Saona excursion, on the way back to the resort they park the boat in what seems like the middle of the ocean but the water is only waist deep. They break out the rum/coke and beer, crank the cd player and it's like party central. A great time had by all some more than others if you get my drift. A word here for Nester the dive master. Just Great is about the only word I can think of. He took care of everyone . He ensured everyone's safety and was just terrific. Upon arriving home, my daughter (20) after watching the video we took while there, informed us he is extremely easy on the eyes as well lol. Each excursion cost 80 u.s. dollars each so in total it came to 320.00 total u.s. If you pay cash for the scuba diving and excursions, Dressel will give you a 10 percent discount. Every night, the resort has a childrens show and an adult show. The adult shows can be pretty funny and the star friends work really hard to entertain you. My only thought on this is the parents who think that it's cute to let your children run all around and on the stage during the adult shows. Not a good idea... at one of the shows one of the star friends came roaring in on a motorcycle and barely missed one of the kids that was running loose. Keep your kids close, nobody wants to see anyone injured. Before i close, just a little note that doesn't really pertain to anything in particular but for some unknown reason, (we were in room 2577) the second week we were there, 5 peacocks decided that our balcony (second floor) would be the perfect place to sleep every night. So around 7:00 p.m. every night they would wander on over and do just that.They were very quiet well behaved little girls so they were more than welcome. We just thought it was cute that they picked our balcony and really don't know why. They did leave a huge mess behind every night but the cleaning staff cleaned it up every morning and you couldn't even tell they had been there .... until the next morning and on it went.I am going to leave you with a few tips and then I will be on my way1. Pre-tan before you go... the sun is very strong and we saw alot of really bad burns.2. Use 45 sun lotion for the first while until you tan up as you will burn. I did and i pre- tanned before I left.3. Bring a mug with you to keep your drinks cool.4. Stick at least 8 to 10 bounty sheets in your suitcase before you go as you will find that t there is a musty smell in your clothes when you get home.5. Tip the workers there , they are really really great people and do appreciate it very  much. Take pleny of one dollar bills. We took 150.00 and used them up.Well folks, that's about it ... We are both very confident that you will really have a nice time. A vacation is what you make it to be ... and if you happen to snag room 2577 ... say hello to our little friends.any questions feel free to email me at sable@shawbiz.ca Melissa  Dave B.

<Content>Love, Love, love the IB Bavaro We just came back from our lovely week at this fantastic resort [5/13/06 to 5/20/06]. From the people who work so energetically breaking into a dance and a song to brighten your days, to the wonderful lush tropical grounds and warm turquoise ocean..... I couldn't have asked for a nicer, more beautiful place to vacation. I love love love those young people who work in this resort; their friendliness and kindness was above and beyond what I have experienced from other resorts in other countries. Special thanks to Gregorie and Dalicia ; ) You brightened our days with your kindness and warmth. The food, mama mia...... so much to choose from. I was very happy with the food offered at the buffets, and the ala carte I absolutely loved the best was La Capole. The buffets contained so many choices of foods that I can't think of many who would go away hungry. In my opinion, the food was tasteful and delectable. I didn't get sick at all, and forgot myself on several occasions drinking the water offered at the buffets. Some of the people I heard complain about being sick from the food were seen visiting the bars quite frequently for alcoholic beverages, and I can't help but wonder if high consumption of fruity tooty alcohol along with the heat we had this week might have been the cause of at least one chaotic belly rather than the food???? I know I laid low on alcoholic beverages while basking in the sun and ocean and kept rehydrated with lots of bottled water instead. Besides enjoying the water and alcohol are not necessarily a good mix. Save it for the evenings in moderation while you are relaxing and enjoying the shows. The entertainment we experienced changed nightly. Broadway shows -- singing, acting, costumes, and choreography -- just as good as going to the real Broadway shows. The professionals are good at what they do. They also lighten up and mingle on other nights with the audience to bring a little spice and laughter. Works like a charm. We had a great time. The weather was grand. We had a few intermittent clouds that offered respite from time to time, and maybe a 30 second shower one evening. All I can say is, for those who are scheduled or have choosen to vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro, rest reassured you will have a wonderful and beautiful vacation. We are already planning to go back next year, and this time it will be for 2 weeks ; ))))) I already miss the friends I made in that resort; who kept our days charged and our laughter flowing.Huggs, Bekka

<Content>Not as Good as Expected Hi,My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 4/27-5/2 2006. We went there for a wedding/vacation. All in all the rooms were very nice, the mini bar was nicely stocked and we did have a remote. There were no problems with the room and we had a guard outside our room that we became quite fond of. I have to agree with the person who said that the maid did not leave you washcloths if you did not leave a tip. That happened to us twice and one of the days we requested that the room not be cleaned. The grounds and pool area were very nice and extremely clean. I would say that the pool was good, but not great compared to where I stayed in Aruba and some other places. The steak restaruant was good as was the Mediterranean, and French gourmet restaraunt. The Japanese got good reviews here on trip advisor but my husband's sushi was warm and my food got cold minutes after it arrived. I personally did not see any top shelf or brand name alcohol, eventhough it was requested and I was with a party of 40 plus people. The buffets were not bad, but you should be mindful of the food at the poolside bar and make sure there are no flies around as the food is partially in the open. The level of service is also not the same as what you receive in the U.S., but the people were pretty friendly. For example, in dining with a party of 10 or more, your food may not come out at the same time as everyone elses. Also you may have to request something more than once in order to receive it. Also,gentlemen, please LONG PANTS are required for the speciality restaraunts.

<Content>Fabulous...It's all about the beach My husband  I just returned from 8 days at the Bavaro(4/28-5/5). To me it's all about the beach. We went to breakfast at 7am each morning. We fed bread to the fish in the water at the restaurant  watched the turtle float around as we pigged out on fresh fruit, eggs, pastries , bacon, OJ, Smoothies(tell them no ice, no sugar..gather fruit  glass of OJ) to blend. Excellent! Then we went to the beach, scoped out a spot near the bar. We walked for 2 hours every day. You can walk in either direction for as long as you want. Just beautiful. Then we swam, snorkeled  read until 4:30. The snorkelling was great right off the beach. we saw hundreds of blue cobalt fish, yellow tuna and tons of other fish. We went to the pool buffet for lunch everyday. They had a band playing. They have salads, hot dogs, burgers, chicken, pork chops, frnch fries, onion rings. They had something special like rib eye steak one day. You can find something you like. We went back to the room at 4:30 each day to get ready for dinner. Our room was fabulous! A suite with a sitting area, balcony, stocked mini-bar and very comfortable king size bed. We had requested a king size bed  2nd floor which we got. Wednesday night is lobster night at the buffet. (Carribean lobster). You can eat as many as you like. I sucked down 4  was stuffed. After dinner we hung at the bar to watch the show. The kids do a show which is cute and then they do funny audience participation gig before the band, singers  dancing begin. One night they had 6 women from different countries up on stage. They were told to run into the audience  gather as many shoes, shirts, pants  bras from the audience. After they count the garments which were gathered, they hold up the shirts for the people to come up  get them back. When the host held up the last pair of pants, a woman came to get them. The host said these are not yours, your husband must come retrieve them. After bantering a couple of minutes, the woman stated that her husband had no underwear on! Well they brought him two pillows to hold in the strategic places. He went on stage to gather his pants. It was hilarious!!! Then they had the nightly show which lasts until 11pm.. It was alot of fun. We didn't make the disco as we were beat from the daily activities. But we did last time we were here 2 years ago. It's worth checking out because the disco is actually a plane. We did 3 specialty restaurants. The Japanese was disappointing unless you like steak well done. The Jambalaya was ok. The appertizers were great but the Rib Eye was fatty. They gave me tons so I did get a meal out of it. But the El Dorata was fabulous!( Seafood Restaurant). The staff there made you feel welcome  special. The appetizers were WONDERFUL. They had shrimp and veal medallions (use the red sauce-it looks like Campbell soup but it complimented the veal. The chef there was the best. The food  atmosphere was terrific. Again the El Dorato---don't miss it. The other specialty restaurants could learn lessons from the crew at the ElDorato. If you want gourmet dining this is not the place for you. But if you want decent food in a fabulous setting, this is the vacation of your dreams. The grounds are awesome with Hibiscus hedges  flowers everywhere. There are pink flamingos  peacocks strutting about. The peacocks can be noisy if they are outside your door but just a beautiful resort. The shacks on the beaches are overpriced. Please check out the stores in the resort before you haggle with the beach shacks. They will screw you big time if you don't know the prices of things. We brought a couple of hundred in ones to tip all week. We tipped the bar guys everytime they brought us a drink. You don't have to but we have been so many times that is all we spent out money on. We have bought all the usual crapola. Also my husband turned half the bar on to Mamujana. Try this if you like rum. It is rum, honey, spices,etc. On the trip home we spoke to a couple who bought the Mamujana at the store  made it. They didn't realize it was at the bar because it was not on the bar menu. we had a fabulous time  you will too unless you are anal. The beach  grounds are gorgeous. You can participate in archery, dance lessons  all kinds of activities or stay on the sidelines  laugh at the characters. The people watching is great. My husband  I are big blondes so they though we were Germans  we kept saying no US. There are people from France, Canada, Holland, Germany. We met tons of characters from Pa. One couple was passed out on the lawn one night. You can get carried away with the drinking so pace yourself. Always ask for the primo booze or you get Normandy. Stoli spicy bloody Mary's with extra limes were great for early in the day. Again to me it's all about the beach and it was the BEST! Go enjoy...you will have a great time  meet all kinds of charcters! we did.

<Content>Fun and Relaxing Time! We spent 8 wonderful days at the IB Bavaro (4/21-4/29). After reading many reviews, we went prepared for the good and bad. The good far outweighs any bad. The bad, if you can call it that, were things that really aren鈥檛 controllable by the resort. Rather, they are things that reflect the reality of a developing country. So here is what we thought:Beach/Pool:As all the reviews say, the beach is phenomenal鈥攂eautiful water, sand and space. We did get up very early each morning to reserve a good seat in the shade. Unfortunately there were a couple of days that half way through the day people would pull up chairs and sit practically on top of us. Thought it was cultural, but soon realized that it wasn鈥檛 any one nationality that saw nothing odd about squishing in next to people when there are other huge open areas. But a Coco Loco and Pina Colada quickly put us back in relaxed mode. The pool area is fun with many activities and seemed to be great for those with kids. We preferred the beach and only used the pool to visit the swim-up bar in the afternoons.Rooms:We had a great room by the beach and pool (1290鈥檚). We called two days before hand and requested one close to the beach and got one. It was large, very clean and had a well stocked mini bar with lots of water, soda and beer. We also were given jugs of water to use for brushing teeth. (I think tipping everyday and leaving gifts helped) The only problem we experienced was that the sliding door to the patio didn鈥檛 lock properly. We didn鈥檛 bother to ask to have it fixed because we didn鈥檛 want to have to wait around for a repair person. Food:We went with an open mind about the food and did not have high expectations given all that we had read. It was actually decent. We both got sick one day and had what we have termed 鈥淐aribbean belly鈥?for several days since returning , but couldn鈥檛 say it was because of a particular thing we ate. Breakfast was by far the best meal with eggs to order, tons of fresh pastries, smoothies, pancakes and anything you could possibly want for breakfast. The lunch buffet at the pool was where we typically ate. There was always something from the grill (burgers, dogs, meats), rotisserie chicken, pizza and sandwiches. Twice we went to the main buffet for lunch which had about the same, but was nice because the food is inside an air conditioned room. For dinner we enjoyed the Japanese, Cajun, Seafood and French restaurants (all pretty good). We went over to the other IB and ate at the Star Rock a couple of nights (no reservations needed). The dinner buffet had many options and has something for everyone. I don鈥檛 really like buffets and was able to eat with out problem. For reservations, we made three when we arrived and then stopped by the reservation desk on the other days to see what was open. We had no problem getting a reservation for an ala carte on any night we wanted (just need to be flexible about the time and restaurant). When we had late reservations, we would stop by the buffet for a little cheese and crackers to hold us over or we went to the Star Rock for some nachos and a game of pool. Bars/Entertainment:The bartenders are incredibly nice and attentive. Beach bar was amusing, as they play the same five songs over and over and over. Coco Locos were awesome. The frozen drinks are pre-made and a bit sweet, but water them down with some rum and all is good or just keep trying different one鈥檚 until you find the one you like. The pool bar was always lively in the late afternoon. Shows varied鈥攕ome were great and others were amusing because they were so bad. Check out the live entertainment in the lobby of the Punta Cana in the evening before the shows. We loved the fact that we could go over and check out what was happening over at the Punta Cana and Domincana for a change of scenery. During the day, there is plenty to do. We painted pottery, sailed, kayaked, snorkeled, played ping- pong and joined in the Star games when we felt like it. We also had no problem just sitting relaxing and reading a book. The beach shops were close by and provided the perfect motivation for taking a walk. Overall:It was a great trip and we would recommend the IB. The staff at the hotel was exceptionally kind and attentive. As long as you don鈥檛 expect everything to be like it is in the States, this is a great place!

<Content>We had a good time, but there are things to just be aware of Overall, we had a great time, but if If you are planning a trip, you should be aware of some things. The food selection and drink selection was good. I was disappointed that they did not hand out bottled water at the bars, only in your minibar.I don't recommend getting married at the Iberostar. It is too croweded and the weddings that we saw were absolutely not private. People were playing beach ball, volleyball, and topless people looked on. The resort was fairly crowded so it was difficult to get a spot on the beach. The maid would not leave a washcloth in the room unless she received a tip. The rooms were kind of skanky and the bathtub was clogged. Unless you get an upgrade, there is no remote for your TV or a coffee pot.

<Content>Very relaxing for world travelers!!!! My boyfriend and I just returned from 5 great nights at the Iberostar Bavaro. Let me start by saying that we have both traveled extensively around the world. For the most part, this was a great place. I had read the review of the Bavaro before we went, and wanted to make sure to share our experiences. Overall, it was a great vacation, and we would recommend the Iberostar Bavaro to others.To be honest, all was not great. First, we ended up in a room with two double beds, not the king bed that we requested. When we talked to the front desk (we speak spanish, but the staff is very good at speaking english), we were told that there were no rooms with king beds available. they had pushed the beds together for us to help the situation, but the beds still had two sets of linens, so it wasn't much help. Other than that, the room was nice, and we appreciated having the sitting area. Our toilet broke one day, and they had someone there to fix it in 5 minutes -- the staff was very helpful throughout the whole trip.Food -- the buffet was the way to go here. We were lucky and the hotel staff let us try 4 of the restaurants there. (You are only supposed to try two for the number of nights that we were at the resort.) The Mediterranean restuarant was AWFUL! The Tropical was not what we expected -- meaning tropical food to me is conch, fritters, jerk chicken, etc. The Jambalaya made up for the two pervious nights, and was great! We also tried the Mexican restaurant, which turned out to be fabulous as well. The snack part of the afternoon between lunch and dinner does not offer much......Breakfast was always good -- same stuff daily, but tons to choose from. I would highly recommend trying the fresh melon juice -- very yummy.Pool and beach were both very nice -- and CLEAN. always chairs both in the sun and in the shade. We got messages on the beach that were great and well done. Tons of acitivties to be involved in at the resort -- something for everyone to do! Or just do nothing!!!Most importantly, we must commend the Bavaro for their staff. They were extremely polite, friendly, and helpful throughout our entire visit!!!! They all seemed to be having fun working, dancing and singing, making it a great environment to be in. (They allso appreciate non-native speakers speaking spanish to them -- a little goes a long way).I would recommend this place to friends and family!!!! Happy travels. N and J

<Content>IGNORE ANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS My husband, myself  our 4 yr. old son stayed at the FABULOUS Iberostar Bavaro from April 23-30th. We had an outstanding time. Like a lot of people, I've been reading the reviews for quite some time to help us with our decision. I am so glad I ignored ALL of the negative reviews because this resort is spectacular. First of all, I will mention the Kids Club for those of you that are looking for this info. as was I. My son only wanted to do a few of the Kids club activities because he had so much fun hanging out with mom  dad. What he did do, he loved. The staff are amazing with kids  they have a daily schedule full of fun things for them to do from activities in the kids pool to games on the beach or crafts in the club. Keila  Belle were fantastic overall. They also babysit at night for $10 /hr. for some adult time if you wish. They come right to your room. We asked Belle  she did it 2 nights. I was 100% comfortable with her. This part of the resort in itself would bring me back again. As for the FOOD. Well I have read a few of the reviews from the same week we were there  I don't understand the negatives about the food. The food was fantastic. My husband is very picky  he thought it was outstanding. We only ate at 1 a la carte because we enjoyed the buffet so much, so did our 4 yr old. There is something for everyone as far as we are concerned. Yes there was weird looking food that we wouldn't try but you are in a different country so you can expect that anywhere. The buffet at lunch by the pool was wonderful. Most days they had something grilling on the patio BBQ with a live Merengue band singing  dancing. There was lots of wonderful salad  veggie items, grilled chicken, the hamburgs were delicious, steamed veggies, french fries, pizza, fish, wraps etc. This list goes on. Also by the pool bar, try the nacho bar. They had the best nachos , cheese  salsa which was great to munch on late in the day by the pool after lunch.There was always something to eat. The dinner buffet closes at 10pm, then reopens at 11pm if you are hungry. There is pizza, burgers  sandwiches if you are hungry. That is open til 1am  not everyone knows that. The pool was gorgeous, very large  great activities going on all day if you want to join. The animation team is fantastic if you are in to that. If not, just sit back  relax or go to the Beach. The Beach is stunning. Absolutely gorgeous white sand  turquoise water. We had no problems finding shaded areas at the pool OR the beach during our stay  it was full capacity.Our room was wonderful. Actually during the 2nd day I left the safe open with several hundred dollars in there. When we went back to our room, the maid, security  a few other staff were there waiting for us because if money was missing, the maid didn't want to be responsible. We had to prove at the front desk the room was ours before we were allowed back in  NOTHING was missing. We were very impressed by that because I have heard horror stories at other resorts.Most of the shows at night were excellent. Some of them a little corny but overall we enjoyed them. I've read negatives about the drinks as well. I had a few I didn't like so I ordered something else. It's included so explore the drink menu. Ask for a Frozen White Russian by the pool. They are fantastic. The beer is good  cold as well. They do have premium alcohol at most bars but not out in the open. Just ask for it  most of the time they have it. The grounds are breathtaking. Beautiful flowers, fountains and ponds throughout the resort. Peacocks  Flamingos were everywhere. They were beautiful as well. This review is a bit long but I wanted to include most information that we too were really looking for. I've travelled a lot  this is the 1st time we have said we will go back to the same resort. We loved it and can't wait to go back. Only 1complaint, take an alarm clock if you need to get up for check out or an excursion. They didn't call me for either wake up  I was not too happy. You also do not need an adapter for electricity. If you have any other questions about the resort or the Mini Kids club, feel free to email me at angela.skinner@sympatico.caEnjoy!!!I

<Content>Just OK After reading many postive reviews, we expected more. Yes the rooms were nice and the resort itself was beautiful. The grounds were very well kept. The food at the buffet was just ok - breakfast being the best. It was difficult to get reservations in the other restaurants. This would have been understandable if the restaurants were full. Several times we were lucky and got cancelations. We got to the restaurant to find it empty. Thiis is frustrating. We found some of the staff to be extremely rude. They're not competing for your repeat business. And in all fairness some staff was extremely accommodating. This isn't the five star resort it's billed to be. It's average at best.

<Content>I agree with Awful!! I am a travel agent and I went to the DR to get married. After staying at numerous Iberostars through the Caribbean and Mexico I thought it was going to be amazing! I had 20 people join me for my wedding and 3 of the rooms had a horrible odour (I mean horrible)Now I have to say my room was fine, it actully had no odour at all....the reason why I thought it was necessay to write this review is to let everyone know that what the client that rated it a 1star is saying is correct. So yes you may get a room that smells, has bugs in the bed and no airconditioning..My parents had to throw out all of their clothes because they could not get the smell out....There was next to no selection at the restaurants for a 5 star resort!! The staff is quite rude unless you tip them and the manager at the hotel is completely unprofessional!! I disagree with the drinks though, I did find that they had quite a selection of international drinks at the lobby bar.To sum things up I have to say that for a 5 star hotel they should not have Smelly rooms and if they do they should be renavated and not given to clients to sleep in!! I know reading down the list you are going to see the positive reviews and had I not had a group with me I would have not known about the horrible rooms either.

<Content>just ok My husband and I just returned from a week stayApril24-May1 at the Bavaro . There are a few things i would mention if you love American food this is not the place to go the food is awful. The rooms are nice the staff is very nice and accommodating alcohol my husband couldn't find one he liked and the fruity drinks are just soooo sweet. One thing I would say about the rooms get a second floor room there are not as many bug's started out in a second floor room no smells very clean no bugs we then moved to a room closer to the pool area into a lower level room and had a ton of little black bugs and a couple of crab's would highly recommend eating at the buffets they are much better than the resturants it takes a good hour to get your food in those restaurant's shows are funny the interact w/the audience alot. On another note bring a watch, alarmclock, cell phone or something to tell time you are on vacation and there are no clocks in sight. The beaches are beautiful absolutely stunning probably the best thing about the vacation the weather is awsome. Also while on the beach try to stop by the huts and bargain shop it is deffinantly a treat they are a little pushy though so watch out. Also I am pregnant and they told me not to do most of the excursions so if you are pregnant don't expect to do much but lie by the pool or beach although it is relaxing. well i guess i will rap it up all in all if the food was better it would have been great it is a beautiful tropical place to relax and enjoy the sun shine so with this said i wish the best to those who are going and I'm sure you will love it.

<Content>Great family time at Iberostar Bavaro Our family of 4 (kids 10  13) just got back from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro (4/21-28). We had a wonderful time. Booked our trip through TNT charter vacations. No problems at all with TNT. In fact it's very nice to have a vacation rep at the resort everyday. JR was happy to answer any questions we had and did not really push the offsite trips on us. Like many islands the poverty level is great. You see nothing but cement and tin shacks from the airport to the hotel, and no ocean in sight. But once you turn into the Iberostar complex it's like another world. Once you arrive at the hotel, they have packages with guests names on them - all predetermined with a room number/location. We tried to ask where the room was and was informed that our questions would be answered the next desk down. So we moved over to the next counter area and this gent reviewed the room location, amenities, gave us room cards and towel cards. I had the strong feeling they really don't want to move you to a different room if you didn't like the location. Fortunately for us our villa was close to the pool  ocean area (rm 1246), one row back from the beach (no beach view). The grounds are just beautiful and there are many friendly peacocks roaming about. They will eat out of your hands and we did not have a problem witht their noise.Our room did smell musty upon first entering. We really noticed the smell on the clothes in the suitcase once we came back home. We noticed a few small ants in the room. We did ask for a king bed with a rollaway bed on the 2nd floor. They assigned us 1st floor, 2 full beds and a rollaway bed was already waiting in the room for us. As it turned out I acutally preferred the 1st floor's easy access. Our sliding doors locked. Our 10 year old slept on one of the built-in sofas, which they already had made into a bed for him. You just remove the back bolster cushions and it's a twin size bed. He was quite comfy. Our 13 year old slept on the portable twin sized bed and she said it was fine.Our shower set up was a bit dangerous. The shower curtain does not cover the entire shower opening, so water was just pouring out of the shower and all over the marble floor. We would bring a beach towel back to the room and keep it infront of the tub at all times. Bathrooms could have been a bit larger. Electrical not a problem, outets just like ours. Make sure you use the bottled water to brush your teeth. One guy on his honeymoon was hooked up to an IV in his room. There is a medical clinic on site that is open 24 hours a day.Refrigerator in room is never very cold. I thought it was broken so I called for a repair, but I don't think it did any good. It takes about 8 hours for a bottle to be cold. Plenty of bottled water, soda and beer in room refrig. It is restocked every day. We left the maid $3 every day and I also brought her a Red Sox shirt.No clocks in room. I brought a small battery operated clock. I also brought a bunch of plastic coated metal coat hangers (which we definitely needed for closet), Dunkin Donuts insulated mugs for my frozen drinks from the pool bar, probably could use water shoes for rocky ocean bottom.The staff at all the restaurants and bars are so nice and friendly. We thought the service was great and was happy to leave them a few dollars after our meals - and they appreciated it very much. Service was excellent whether you tipped or not.The food was fine, not great. Plenty of foods to choose from, though the kids were picky. Thankfully they had pizza, fries and icecream available all the time! Hamburgers were nasty. There was always a carved meat selection every night, which was delicious, a fresh pasta station, salads galore, strange deli selections, good breakfasts with pancake, omelets, breads, pastries, cereals and fruits. The main buffet is so large that you never have to wait for a table. We ate at 3 specialty restaurants - Jambalaya, Japanese, and the Steakhouse. They were all good. We liked the Jambalaya restaurant the best. Japanese rest. took 2 hours to get through dinner. None of us were ever sickLots of activies around the pool area. Thought they could have done a better job announcing the activity. Pool is a huge zero entry pool. Nice for little kids to play at the waters edge. Lots of little kids and teens. Saw a few singles. Lots of families from US, UK, Germany, Netherlands - all so nice. Big swim up bar area. Large buffet served by the pool all day. I brought swim tubes from home for my kids to use in pool, lots of other people did the same thing. We gave them to the newcomers the day before we left. Use sunscreen often - we used #50 on the kids - several times during the day. No one in our family got a bad sunburn, but many others did. It's very hot and humid all the time there - even at night. Lots of shade by the pool or the beach. You do indeed need to get up early to reserve your lounge chairs. The evening shows were corny but fun. We stayed until our eyes drooped. The sun does a number on you!Trinkets can be purchased at the hotel or in a bazaar area just down the beach. The vendors were actually quite nice and loved to talk baseball. You end up paying about half of what they are asking. We had a great time, I think my kids preferred the Riu Caribe in Cancun over this hotel, just because the activities were more organized.

<Content>very relaxing vacation Had a great time!My wife and I were at the Iberostar Bavaro from April 21, 2006 鈥?April 28, 2006 and found it to be a very nice place. I spent the last three months reading reviews on this site and found it very helpful. Do not let the negative reviews on this site out weigh the positive reviews. Our room was very clean and we had a great location, about 100 feet from the pool. The mini bar was always stocked with beer, bottled water and pop. If you need more just ask for it and they are willing to give you more.The staff was always very friendly. I would suggest that you tip a couple of dollars (even though it is not expected), believe me they work even harder to make your stay perfect. For example, we met two brothers who worked at the resort Leonardo, Siboney bar on the beach, and Franklin at the Lobby Buffet, they always had our drinks ready and our favorite table ready for us when they would see us.The resort is very well maintained. The grounds keepers were constantly working to make everything look perfect. The beach was beautiful as well. The food was good. There was always something to eat. I even tried several things that I would not normally try and found all of it to be very good. I would suggest that you make reservations at the specialty restaurants, buffet can get boring. We ate at the Japanese and Steak house at the Bavaro and Mexican at the Dominicana they all were very good. If you鈥檙e looking for a very clean resort, friendly staff, good food and a beautiful beach then the Iberostar Bavaro is the resort for you. We found it to be one of the most relaxing vacations.

<Content>Awesome Just returned from one week stay at the Iberostar Bavaro on Apr. 20th. My husband and I had an awesome time and would recommend this resort. The grounds are spectacular, all kinds of wildlife running around. The food and the service were great (much better than some other resorts I鈥檝e been to). The staff is very friendly and really tries to do as much as they can to please (although there was a bit of a language barrier which is excepted as you are in another country). The rooms are clean and spacious. There was no musty smell in our room and the mini bar was always stocked with water, pop and beer. The only thing that I though was a bit odd was that you had to pay for the safe in your room. As an all-inclusive resort I think this should be included. Other than that this resort has everything you look for in a vacation. They have a variety of activities for everyone to participate in and I found that the staff was not pushy if you decided you didn鈥檛 want to take part. The beach is just wonderful, white sand and turquoise water. My husband enjoyed swimming out to the reef (which is not very far) and watching the variety of fish swim by. There were plenty of beach chairs, however, if you wanted one under the shade you need be out on the beach by 8 a.m as they do go quickly. The nightly entertainment was good. We didn鈥檛 stay through to the end for every show as we found that after a day in the strong Dominican sun we were too tried. Our weather was fabulous it only rained once and it was in the afternoon. In all our trip was wonderful. One piece of advice, men bring long pants if you plan to go to the specialty restaurants, they will not let you in if you don鈥檛 (even if they are three quarter length

<Content>we loved it Went to the Iberostar Bavaro hotel during April spring break. We have been to all-inclusives in Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Ixtapa, Los Cabos, and Puerto rico and traveled throughout Europe. We brought my 2 sons (ages 13 and 17) and my older son's friend. We had the best time!!! First, the staff was the nicest, most hard-working, and most accommodating of any I have ever seen in my life---and they are genuine. The grounds were absolutely gorgeous. Our room was impeccably clean, not musty, beautifully decorated, spacious, and had a lovely balcony. The pool was lovely and the beach was glorious. There are millions of lounge chairs around both, and shaded areas. The clientele was from all parts of the world. You will hear French, German, English, Spanish all day. No snooty people from the states. The food was not bad, compared to other places we have been. Breakfast was fantastic....anything you could ever want to eat (eggs, french toast, waffles, pancakes, meat, omelettes, fruit, hot and cold cereal, fruit, cheese, multiple types of breads and croisssants....). Lunch consisted of pasta, pizza, grilled chicken, hot dogs, hamburgers, skewed meats, fruit, cheeses, salads. Dinners weren't as good at the buffet. The restaurants we went to were above average ( mediterranean, Japanese, and steak restaurants) and the service was wonderful. The property is huge and you can use the facilities of the neighboring Iberostar hotels.We did have some stomach problems when we left, but this is very common in countries with unpurified tap water. Even though we avoided brushing our teeth with the water, you can get contamination from the pool or the ocean. If you are prepared, and take some antibiotics along, you should be fine. Only problem with this resort is that the peacocks will keep you up at night.It definitely didn't ruin our vacation to this absolutely beautiful and wonderful resort.

<Content>Awful! The staff was not accomodating, and actaully quite rude. Our room was moldy, and had ants in the bed, spiders on the walls and roaches in the bathroom. It smelled so bad, we only were there for showers and sleep. Two people on our trip got sick from the food. One of them did not have a room and the staff was not concerned about the mix up. The water they gave you for the room was a gallon jug, that was left on the counter. The room service items were so gross (think only chicken nuggets and nasty tacos) that we never ordered. The food was so bad, all deep fried, hot dogs and fly-covered buffets of olive loaf and cucumbers. No salads or fresh food at all, and you can't drink the water, not even open your mouth in the shower or to brush your teeth using sink water. The fish, is a gamble at best, lots of sick people from fish. They don't make chicken, so you are in luck if you like eggs for breakfast and fries for the day. The grounds were beautiful and the beach nice, but if you are looking for good food, or drink, or service, BEWARE! If you have to go, bring granola bars and off spray for your room.

<Content>Didn't want to leave! Last year we visited the Iberostar at the Ramana area of the DR. This time we we tried theBavaro Suites and could not have been happier. My husband and I traveled with myson (almost 17 and his friend) during the School Spring break. The boys had a blastsocializing with the kids from Germany and England at the Disco every night - while weslept. I would start my day taking a long walk on the beach while my husband playedtennis with the Pro. We would meet up for breakfast around 9AM. At 10:30AM I wouldjoin the stretching class by the pool. The rest of my day would typicallly involve loungingon the beach, playing volleyball from 3:30PM - 6PM and then having dinner at one of thespeciality restaurants or the main dining room buffet. The Jumbalaya restaurant wasterrific as was the Mediterranian. We did one excursion involving a speed boat - theboys were thrilled to be able to drive the two-person boat - and snorkeling for about anhour. I brought some bread and the fish were literally eatiing out of my hand!. My splurgewas to treat us all to a massage on the beach - highly recommended. I limited my purchases to bags of Dominican Coffee to give out as gifts but was tempted to purchasethe Larimar jewelry that is sold in the gift/jewelry stores etc. Please feel free to e-mail withany questions. We are already trying to figure out how to go next year for a slightly longerstay. One more thing - although the weather report looked bad - we had fabulous weatherduring our stay - April 14-21.

<Content>The "Kojaks" Loved It! My family of four, (mom, dad, and two teenage daughters) just returned from our stay (April 15-22) at Iberostar Bavaro, and we had a wonderful time! All the good things you have heard are true and then some! Beautiful, serene beach. Fun pool area with plenty of shade (You'll need it...HOT!) Good food, and best yet, the most incredible staff on the face of the earth!We went to the shows each night and the audience particpation shows were some of the funniest things I have ever seen. The entertainment staff, including Huck, Donkey, and Maximo were fun and energetic. Get involved early in your stay...a great way to meet people, and who really cares if you look silly?The humidity will do crazy things with your hair, and since the bathroom amenities do not include conditioner, be sure to bring some from home. The airport is a trip, no pun intended! Arriving is not so bad, but trying to get out of the Dominican Republic will most likely try your patience! Not only is the airport really hot, but they have preparations for about 1/4 of the amount of people that come through there. The lines are nuts, and the language barrier and rampant disorganization really put a crimp in the procedures. But, you eventually WILL get onto an airplane, so try to keep your sense of humor about the whole thing.

<Author>Doogerdog
<Content>Great time in the DR We returned from the Iberostar Bavaro on April 11. I read many reviews on Trip advisor and was very thankful for the tips I received. I wanted to add one of my own.Our group consisted of 4 adults and 2 teenage boys (although both boys were thought to be over 18 and thus had full privileges). The hotel was very nice! The rooms and grounds were extremely clean! The food was of good quality, plentiful and of great variety. The rooms were spacious. We requested a room with a king bed while the boys had a room with 2 double beds. Their room was recently updated. Ours was a little musty smelling (from the AC) but not a problem. A few ideas -- Bring many $1 bills for tips. The staff does appreciate even a $1 (Some make only about $100 a week). Bring a travel clock as there are no clocks in the room. Although you can leave a couple of $$ nightly for the maids, you might want to consider leaving a box of crayons, markers, coloring books etc for their kids. Items like that are tough to come by on the island. Bring candles or room fresheners for the musty smell (our room had it the kids room did not). Consider bringing 2 way radios. We used ours on a daily basis to keep track of our kids. They work pretty well and cover almost the entire property.The rooms had a mini bar (included) and it was stocked daily with bottled water, soda and beer. Make sure the bottled water has not been opened. They also give you a 1-gallon jug of water. Ours was not new (possibly filled with tap water) so we avoided using it. If you have a sensitive stomach, do not use the tap water, use the bottled water. On the subject of the stomach problems, none of us got ill. Some did get a touch of travelers stomach but that could have been because of all of the coconut, banana and pineapple we ate and had in drinks (they are a natural laxative). However, we did avoid certain things such as cold foods on the buffet for example.The breakfast and lunch buffet were excellent. The lunch buffet is out by the pool so everyone goes in bathing suits. If you get bored of the lunch buffet at the Bavaro try going to the grill located at the Punta Cana/Dominica (opposite end of the property). The restaurants for dinner were excellent. The Gourmet and Japanese and Steak house restaurants were excellent. We have Verizon phone service. After getting free software for international calling, we were able to make calls for between .60 - $1.40 per minute to the US or each other. We have a very strong signal. Additionally, text messaging was no additional charge. In the end it was a great trip. There were equal parts American and European (German, French, Dutch) so if topless sunbathers or men in Speedos embarrass you, don't look.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro excellent value! Just got back today 20th April after a 2 week holiday at this hotel. It is our 3rd visit to the DR and this is the best time ever.We have 2 teenage boys and they loved it. They made lots of friends American, French,German,British and had a great time.We found the staff very friendly and very helpful. We did notice a distinct lack of please and thank you from some guests who would rather click their fingers at the hard working staff for attention. Manners maketh the man!The gardens are beautiful with peacocks and pink flamingoes and the odd cockerel.The rooms are clean and comfortableThe food is varied and quickly turned over so always fresh. We could not fault the food as there is something for everyone.The beach is fabulous we walked along the beach everyday.For those people who are negative about this hotel I would suggest another carribean island ie St Lucia Barbados or Antigua where the hotels may offer slightly higher standards but be prepared to pay a whole lot more.Our opinion for what its worth is that this hotel offers everything to the highest standard you can expect on this island. If you plan to go to the DR this hotel is hard to beat.

<Content>Wanted to stay longer! My sister, our husbands and children (ages 5  9) visited the Bavaro from 4/8-4/14.As an avid reader of trip advisor, I was sure to check as many reviews of the Bavaro before we booked it. I can definitely say people were right about how beautiful the resort is. It is lush with peacocks, flamingos, etc. Prior to leaving for the Bavaro, our travel agent put in a request for us to have 2 rooms close to eachother and near the beach/pool. Both requests were fulfilled and we were very happy with the accomodations (we were in rooms 2395  2396, very close to the pool/beach). The rooms are very nice, just don't leave any food or drinks in your room or they will be covered in a very short time with little black bugs, as we found out. We did tip housekeeping everyday, but didn't really get any special treatment. I did like the fact that when I went to my room when housekeeping was there, they were putting clean sheets on the beds, not just making the beds.The beach and pools are both great, plenty of room at both. There are some nice small reefs within swimming distance of the beach that we took bread out to and fed the fish. The kids loved this, but be aware that some of the fish were pretty big and might scare small children, as it did my 5 year old! If you stay to the left of the beach where the banana boats leave from, there are less rocks and coral in the water than to the right side where it was hard to swim and stand. The banana boat was a lot of fun, just advise the boat driver not to go too fast with little ones (we were thrown off 3 times). We did visit the tents (shops) at the end of the beach to buy jewelry and get the kid's hair breaded. The price for the hair braiding was half of what we were quoted at the resort. There are only 2 people that do the hair breading at the resort, versus 5 at the beach shops. At the resort you had to make an appointment, at the beach you did not.Drinks and food were plentiful, but the local alcohol is disgusting. Ask for name brand alcohol if available (it is not at every bar). I really liked the banana mamas and frozen lemonade (with Stoli vodka), but the rest of the frozen drinks were very sweet. We made reservations at four of the specialty restaurants, even though we were told we could only make 3 reservations. The Japanese and the steak house were both very good. The Jambalaya was ok as well as the other restaurant at the Dominicana we went to (can't remember the name). We did tip everywhere we went because the workers do work hard. Knowing some Spanish is helpful, but if one person doesn't understand you, try asking another.The weather was very nice, not humid, but hot. We did have one full day of rain, but we still went snorkeling and swimming (beware of very slippery walkways when they are wet). The star friends did their best to entertain people during the bad weather. My daughter went to the kids club for a few hours and had a good time. The staff is very friendly and attentive to the children, unlike some other resorts we have visited. Also, go to the evening shows, the star friends do their best to keep you entertained. The peacocks are very nice to look at and feed, but if your room is where they nest (up high in a tree by the main walkway), you will have your own personal alarm clock in the morning! They are very loud! Thankfully it wasn't an issue where our room was located. We did bring our own clock, there are none in the rooms. The only problem is though, that when you leave your room all the power goes out, so the clock had to keep being reset. Some reminders: bring plenty of sunscreen, floats for the pool, insulated cups for drinks, $10. per person for the visitors card at the airport, money for tipping, brush your teeth with the bottled water, and relax and have a great time! I wish I was there right now!

<Content>Bravo Bavaro Our family vacationed at Bavaro from April 8-15th. We had a fabulous time from start to finish. The resort is impeccable. The grounds are lush and beautiful. The wild life abundant and beautiful. The people very helpful and very caring. Our children are 13 and 11 and the resort provided enough action for them to keep busy all day long...dance lessons, mini golf, archery, rifle shooting, water games, spanish lessons (very helpful), and all done by a wonderful Star Friends Staff. Maximo, Dalkey and Huck couldn't have been more professional, amusing and entertaining.I read many reviews on this site...some scared me. Please understand that many people are there and you just can't satisfy everyone. My husband and I were pleased by everything...The food was wonderful. The buffets had quite a varied variey. Something for everyone. We had dinner in three specialty restaurants...Steak House (great), Japanese (good), and the Jumbalaya restaurant(good). We had absolutely no complaints. This resort caters to families..all day long and all night long. The shows and entertainment were good. Speak to the people, they are a wealth of information and really do want to make your stay a wonderful one. We met people from all over the world...France, Germany, many people form Europe...so interesting. Our rooms were clean and comfortable and honestly we spent most of our time on the incredible beach...we did go early but spots are available..Our only misfortune was coming back home...we will return and we can't wait.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro Punta Cana: Iberostar Bavaro Resort 鈥?April 11th through 17th. Vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic was absolutely beautiful. Everything that one would want in a 鈥榮tay at the compound鈥?type vacation which is exactly what my wife and I wanted. Everyday we sat on the beach from 9am until about 2pm. Then went back to our room and showered, changed, and planned out our evening. Usually we would sit in the many areas around the resort and have a few drinks before dinner. We were both so tired from the sun that our evening adventures were very limited. We did a lot of reading though!Food: Basically the food is Okay. As much as I can say about it, it definitely is not the greatest fare in the world. But, for an up and coming resort destination, I think the food is suitable. They have the usual food for children and very picky adults (pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, etc) and they also try to appeal to the more exquisite tastes. But I feel that they try and do too much in this area and would do better either limiting their selections or producing better quality/easier to make food. I guess with the various nationalities that they must cater to, its very difficult to please everyone鈥檚 palette. Even the 鈥榮pecialty鈥?restaurants鈥?were not that special. I鈥檓 not trying to say that the food is terrible though. I had no problem eating 3-4 times a day and eating more than my fair share. Bottom line: Do not go to this resort for quality/gourmet food. Go to relax and enjoy the beach. Beach: Gorgeous! Breathtaking! Like a dream. The sand is like powder. The resort employees rake the beach every morning for seaweed and whatever else happens to come in from the ocean. I suggest taking a walk in either direction and just enjoy the sites. The water is crystal clear blue/green too and very soothing when you have been lying in the sun for several hours. I wouldn鈥檛 change this for anything! Perfect!I would, however, like to say that the reserving the beach 鈥榩alapa鈥檚鈥?was out of control. Because I knew about this ahead of our trip, I would wake up at 630am and go out to reserve my space only to see that 95% of the palapa鈥檚 were already taken. It turns out that most folks just leave their stuff overnight. I just didn鈥檛 feel like that was very polite so we didn鈥檛 leave our stuff. I did usually find a chair but the choices were very very limited. There are many more choices around the pool area and you wont have a difficult time finding chairs there. Oh鈥ool Area: Perfect as well! Huge pool. Very nice. Very close to food and drink. Vendors and other local salespeople: Very pushy, demanding and rude. I actually didn鈥檛 expect to be approached like this. One day, as I was walking past the group of beach vendors that is close to our resort, I noticed this young man sitting inside of his 鈥榮tore鈥? Then, what I couldn鈥檛 believe is how, when he saw me looking at him, he jumped from his chair and literally ran 30 feet to my side and tried to coax me into entering his store. A very uncomfortable situation to say the least. My wife actually felt threatened and we decided to continue our walk past these vendors but as close to the ocean as we could get. This helped a little but the vendors still yelled at us to come into their stores. You would think that the vendors would know that this type of sales tactic does not work very well with most people. But then I realize that these vendors do live in basically a third world country and this IS how they make their living. Before the trip, I was very excited to go and visit the on the beach local vendors. But I just felt so uncomfortable that we decided to avoid this area at all costs. Another situation that should be addresses is the airport 鈥榖aggage handlers鈥?that wear the white shirts and camp out in front of the taxi area when you arrive in the DR鈥nd they are also camping out where you get dropped off when you are leaving the DR. This is another group of extraordinary pushy and demanding people who will FOLLOW YOU until you let them carry your bags. Now, I am a very fit person and simply do not feel it necessary to have my bags carried 50 ft to the taxi. My first time through, I basically got a running start and tried to run through this group with a stern 鈥楴o Gracias!鈥? But one man followed us out and my VIP Rep had to tell him to go back inside. On the way to the airport from the resort, I didn鈥檛 feel like dealing with the hassle so I just let the guy carry my bags the 50 feet and paid him $4 US for the 4 bags that he carried. (They expect $1 for each bag). I think the airport should try and do something about this situation. But for now, I wouldn鈥檛 bother trying to avoid this group and let them carry your bags. RESORT: The resort grounds are breathtaking. Absolutely beautiful! My wife and I took a stroll and look at some of the other resorts that were near the Bavaro and basically ALL of the resorts are fairly nice. I do think that the Bavaro has a small edge on the other resorts, but basically anywhere that you stay will be fine. Our room was nice and big. The AC worked great! Each morning, I would leave a $5 US for our maid with any small requests, and she would accommodate us immediately. (ex. More bottled water, more diet coke, extra pillows, etc). I think that tip went a long way to our enjoyment. I also tipped the bar tenders generously as well. Maybe every 3 drinks or so I would hand over a $1 US. LOCAL AREA: The trip to and from the airport was definitely interesting. This is a third world country and not everyone lives the way that we do. Yes there is trash in places, but its not to be unexpected. There are broken down cars on the side of the road. Shacks and broken down houses. People seem to congregate outside of their homes so you will see lots of locals just enjoying the day outside. The roads are a mess compared what we are used to鈥ut like I said none of this is unexpected. AND, none of the local landscape would be a deterrent from coming back to the DR to visit. It is local flavor and that is exactly what I wanted to see. I don鈥檛 think that my wife and I will be coming back to the DR for quite some time. And if we do, I think we will spend more money for the Beaches resort 鈥?or maybe stay somewhere else on the island. One of the things that we like to do together is walk around the town and visit the tourist attractions, the local vendors, stores, food, etc. This is something that you just don鈥檛 do in Punta Cana. They have their excursions but we weren鈥檛 really that interested in the safari, snorkeling, or 4-wheeling. I think we will visit St Johns, Antigua, or the Bahama鈥檚 before we visit the DR again. We did have a very nice time though and did exactly what we wanted to do. RELAX!

<Content>Wonderful Time with the Family I just returned from a week's stay and my family and I had an absolutely wonderful time. We have an infant, so we wanted to stay at an all-inclusive resort so that we didn't have to travel much from the hotel. The hotel's lobby is quite impressive and the grounds are spectacular. Be prepared to see all types of birds, peacocks, swans, flamingos and ducks wandering the premises. The grounds are very lush and well maitained. We were definitely impressed. The staff was very friendly and helpful, when needed.We were not disappointed with most of the food offerings. The following are my suggestions:Make reservations for the Steakhouse and the French Restaurant. The Steakhouse has great flavorful steak that has been prepared right on the grill. Very tasty and juicy! The French Restaurant has a good duck dish.We were, however, disappointed with Jambalaya. During lunch, try the Rotisserie chicken which seems to be a favorite. Breakfast was fine. Pretty much everything was covered: waffles, pancakes, eggs, bacon, etc. I suggest the omelets, which were made to order. Great assortment of fruits and fruit drinks, including fresh orange juice.The beach tends to fill up quickly so you might want to get there early to pick you location under an umbrella. I suggest going to the area on the right side because there is a snack/bar right there. Not too far to get a drink!!The shows generally were good. We could've done without the tourist contests, they tended to be more silly than anything else. Nevertheless, ample entertainment is available.

<Content>Beautiful Views!! My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro during our honeymoon, the week of March 26th-April 2nd. The Grounds-Stunning and very beautiful. However, during that week they were putting sand down and re-painting the walkways in the resort. This happen to be right in front of our room, and was a little inconvenient. Don't bring fancy shoes with high heels! It is very hard to walk on the fake cobblestone walkways. But overall it is just breathtaking. Don't forget your camera. Your pics will look just like a postcard. The Room-It was very nice. It appeared that while we did tell our travel agent we were honeymooners, we must have received a pretty bad room. When we got there, I immediately told the front desk clerk that we were on our honeymoon and we wanted a room as close to the beach as possible. We had to wait a few minutes, but we were upgraded to something closer...We did not receive any type of honeymooner basket or anything special like that at all... but I guess we didn't care too much. We did bring crayons and candy for the maids. All week, they kept our minibar overstocked and they left nice little touches in the room all week. The bed was very comfortable, the room didn't smell too bad. We brought some candles, problem solved. It was really noisy early in the morning..the staff would yell to each other and the peacocks! They were VERY annoying. It sounded like they were shouting MAY-O!The Service-Outstanding! Do your best to make friends with the waiters and bartenders and you will never have an empty drink! We made friends with Cecillio and Jorge..very nice guys! The Food-The Steakhouse was great! Very good steak! However, some of the other foods we take for granted here in the US weren't so great at the Iberostar. The hamburgers and hotdogs were pretty gross. But the bbq they did every day by the beach was delicious! There are speciality restaurants you need reservations for, and they say you only get about 3 for the week. But if you visit the front desk reservations person, they sometimes have cancellations. Also-if you make friends with some of the wait staff in these specialty restaurants, they will sneak you in again later in the week.The Beaches and Pool-The beach was perfection! The sand was like white soft sugar and the water was torquoise blue! We had no trouble getting a hut every day we were there. We did have some issues trying to get a good spot by the pool. While the pool was nice, it was rampant with children and teenagers. For families that is great, but if you are honeymooning it can be kind of a bummer. We preferred the peace and quiet of the beach. The Weather-It was nice for the first couple of days. An average of about 85 degrees. However, the last three days it did rain...A LOT! But my new husband and I put on our bathing suits and just went outside anyway. I mean, it may have been raining, but it was raining in paradise! Activities-In my opinion I thought the place catered too much to children. It was sometimes a little jarring when you were trying to relax or take a nap, and the kids would be screaming and laughing. But please keep in mind we were on our honeymoon. So, I guess we should have looked for an adults only type of resort. I just thought it was funny that a place that had activities for children, had a beach that was topless. Some advanced sex education for the kiddies! But my husband didn't seem to object when it came to the topless european women! :) The Maniarium was a LOT of fun, even though it was raining on that day. I just loved snorkeling with sharks.Overall-a great value and a lot of fun. If you make sure to bring pepto bismol (you must start taking it a few days before you leave), a high spf sunscreen, and a first aid kit...you will be fine. Also, bringing along an English to Spanish travel dictionary doesn't hurt either....

<Content>Truly Paradise! A whole group of us went down to escape the January weather--the weather there was truly wonderful--in the 80's and sunny....Most of us stayed at the Bavaro and a few were at the Dominicana....We were at the Bavaro and found the rooms to be nice size...we had people in and had plenty of room...one thing to take to heart--do not bring food of any kind back to your room--they tell you this--and do not do it....you will be visited by little ants if you do....otherwise we had none....The beach was heavenly, soft sugary sand and plenty of little cabanas to sit under...Take a walk down the beach and haggle with the guys...some are really nice guys and others are not...I bought from the nice ones and got a fair price...do not overpay since they love to negotiate...We found the bottom dollar on coffee was 4.00. The food was great and plenty of it everywhere...the ice cream by the beach(chocolate chip) was my favorite....The specialty restaurants we went to were very good....Japanese was great(and my hubby does not even like Japanese but liked it) and the Gourmet Restaurant was wonderful--wish we had went there twice...The friendliness of the people was noteworthy when you compare to other vacation spots...I tipped our maid a couple of bucks per day and she had fun trying to teach me some Spanish....I even wrote Spanish on her note every day...And if you go on the Outback Safari Tour(I highly recommend it and be prepared for potholes...)be sure you take some kids crayons, markers, notebooks, pencils, stickers etc...since they stop at a couple of schools and that is how the survive....very poor in the outback country....Our guide was fantastic and even shared a pic of his little one....Sorry it took me so long to write this but have been busy planning our next trips and working so I can pay for them....one of our group is going back to Punta Cana already and I would too if I could--definitely want to take my adult kids and family maybe next year...Also, while we were there Angela Jolie, Brad Pitt and Robert DiNero were there--of course, we didn't run into them.....Have a great time if you go! Take lots of ones for tips since the people who are maids etc are very poor...one of our guides said the way they make more money is to go to English school on Sunday...so education very important....

<Content>Great Vacation! A neighbor and I traveled to the Iberostar Bavaro Resort April 1 - 8, 2006, with our teenaged daughters and had a nice time. I had stayed at the Iberostar Maya Resort in Playa Del Carmen last year and have to admit I preferred Mexico over this resort. However, the Dominican beaches are spectacular and worth the trip. The Bavaro pool was very disappointing. We spent the entire time on the beach.The biggest disappointment at the Bavaro were the drinks. Very watery and never cold. I was so ready for a drink with ice when I got home. The food was very good except the desserts. The desserts at every Iberostar resort I've been to are sub-standard.Although we specifically requested rooms with 2 double beds, and their records clearly showed that because we asked to see their copy of the reservation, they would not accommodate us and change it. The front desk personnel were not very accommodating. The rooms were fine and the air conditioning worked well. The rooms weren't musty smelling however we did have a problem with little black bugs until the maids stopped putting flowers in the room. Then the bugs disappeared. The maids were not generous with bath towels and when my friend asked for a couple more towels at the front desk, you'd think we'd asked for a large sum of money. Maid service was average and we did not see any difference when we tipped. The maids were very noisey in the morning outside the rooms and served as our alarm clocks. There are not clocks anywhere at the resort so bringing a watch or travel alarm clock is a must. There were many topless sunbathers on the beach and the American's were definitely in the minority. Lots of German, French, and Dutch guests.We kept checking the weather forecasts online before the trip and were bummed when it showed clouds and rain in the forecast everyday but ignore that. Our weather was beautiful and a local person told us they've heard that from many travelers to the Dominican. Bring lots of sun lotion because one person can easily go through an entire bottle alone.The nightly entertainment was very average and very adult oriented. Not for children.A word of advice to travelers to this resort with teenagers aged 16 and 17 years old. Make sure they get a white bracelet at check in even if you have to lie about their age because you must be 16 years old to enter the disco and won't let anyone in without a white bracelet! No exceptions and they check everyone at the door of the disco. Technically the white bracelet is for those 18 years of age and older because it gives permission for alcoholic beverages. Iberostar really needs to have a different colored bracelet for 16 and 17 year olds so that they can get into the disco without having the ability to consume alcohol. Once your child gets a red bracelet, they will NOT change it.All in all it was a very relaxing vacation and I would go back, mainly for the beach, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

<Content>Liked it so much, it was our 2nd time there Hola! We (hubby, 2 kids age 9  12 and I) just returned last week from Iberostar Bavaro. Aside from the weather (which obviously they can't control) the entire experience was wonderful. Staff: Did not encounter a non-friendly, non-smiling person anywhere. It was frustrating trying to communicate with a few that didn't speak English. The Star Friends team was so much fun. Grounds: One word: paradise. It was very lush and beautiful. Well taken care of. Pool/beach: Nice large pool - never felt crowded. Separate kiddie pool for people with wee ones. Pool also had zero tolerance entrance. Nice that you can see the beach/ocean from the pool. If you want a beach hut, head out early, although they do have alot of them. Food: Don't think you could find a larger selection of food anywhere. The buffet covered about everything. I was surprised to see grilled lobster and sushi. I was really missing ranch dressing and sour cream. Only went to two specialty restaurants: Mexican and Cajun; both were good. It would have been nice not to have to make reservations and just be able to pop in if we wanted to try it. I would advise calling guest services late afternoon and see if any restaurants have cancelations and make your reservations that way.Bar service: Sometimes it seemed crowded at the pool bar. If you tipped them in the beginning, they remember you and you get better service (and stronger drinks) I thought the drink selection was fine, but I'm into those sweet frozen drinks.Entertainment: They have some very talented people there. And fun. There is alot to do and if you have kids, they will not be bored! Some people choose not to get involved. I'm not one of them. I did everything from salsa dancing to bingo to beach games. Even got drug up on stage a few times. The shows were very entertaining and I found myself laughing so hard I was crying. They have a kid's club that our daughter enjoyed and they put on their own shows before the main show. They did a beach party with calypso music The Star Friends really try to make sure everyone is having a good time. Ultimately, I think that is what made the trip great for us.Rooms: The rooms were ok. The beds seemed small and there wasn't much room to store clothes. Our location was fairly convenient. I would advise requesting a room close to main walkway - some of those villas were a trek from the lobby or pool. Would also recommend 2nd floor (with balcony) as opposed to first floor (with terrace) Definitely more privacy that way.Misc: The gym needed more treadmills and eliptical machines. All three Iberostars used this gym and they only had 3 treadmills (and one was broken) and one eliptical machine. The shopping was adequate.I'd go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Bavaro is great Just returned from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro. We were very pleased with everything.Beach and pool: Perfect. Snorkeling with a variety of fish just off the beach, a one minute swim away. The best shaded locations are gone by 9:00, but with some searching one can usually be found after that. You are not supposed to reserve the huts, but be aware that many do come out before eating breakfast and put towels on the chairs. The pool was clean and very large, so you could find places to swim without bumping into anyone.Food: We found a good selection of food. Some was the same every day, but each day had some different specials that were very good and prepared right there as you were waiting. If you get something that is not cooked to your liking you can go back and get a replacement. The fish was always good, never overcooked or undercooked. Nobody that I talked to got sick from the food. We do not recommend the steak in the buffet, but every thing else was good to very good. (not gourmet, but this is a buffet, not a big city 3+ star restaurant.) The gourmet and the Japanese specialty restaurants were quite good, though perhaps not up to big city gourmet standards. We are from a small town, but have eaten in restaurants in many major cities in Europe and the USA.For lunch at the pool be sure to check out what they are grilling over toward the beach each day. It is usually better than what is on the pool buffet.The rooms: Our room (2536) did not have a musty smell at all. I could not find anyone with this complaint, but there might be such rooms. When set on low our air conditioner would eventually turn off and did not come back on, but this did not happen on the higher settings.The Bars: We found the bartenders to be very nice. At times they are very overworked trying to serve a lot of drinks as fast as they can. They will use higher quality liquor if you ask, and put either more or less liquor in your drink.We found everone on staff very friendly and helpful. Make your reservation and go. We used Apple, which gave us the additional resource of two wonderful people on duty daily. The Apple staff was also a help at the airport. We both arrived early and departed early on Apple charters USA3000 airline. We had no problems with arrival or departure.

<Content>Fantastice Experience at Bavaro Suites ! Greetings. Just returned From Iberostar Bavaro Suites from March 27th to April 4th. For those taht were there that week,...Yes , I was the man from Minnesota with the Video Camera Embedded in my right eye at the Beach Bar, Swim up pool bar and Lobby Bar !! LOL Esteban from Mpls. This resort was Spectacular!  Landscaping of the Bavaro suites and the two other Iberostars were truly incredible. Extremly well maintained, Tropical with Palm trees every foot you walked . How about all the exotic birds!! Peacocks al over the Resort along with Flamingos ,ducks, hens etc. I was surprised by how loud those Peacocks were . especially as a wake up call each morning. Amazing visually as well. Grade 10 out of 10. Beach. WOW !! If you wnat long walks for excercise and views, this is the Beach for you. It simply goes on and on . resorts line up all along Bavaro baech. keep in mind hoever that all the Resorts are NOT easily visible from the water. Which is nice, in order to keep the beach Beautiful. You really have to walk up as close to as you can to get a clear view of the entrance of the resorts. Not a easy task which is nice because of the privacy for the guests of each resort. very Tropical beach Grade 10 out of 10. Service. Very good at the Entrance when you are checking in. However I was not greeted with a drink as I read from so many reviews when you arrive. My luggage was accidently dropped off at the other Iberostar Resort. They very quickley sent me with one of ther men on the cart annd Thank goodness it was there at the steps of the Iberostar Punta Cana. I would give the total service from the Bartenders, to the cooks, Maid service, Greeters at the restaraunts a 10 out of 10. please remember that if you treat people with respect and dignity you will be returned with the same ! This was my second trip to Punta Cana and I on both occassions have experienced warm , happy , energetic enthusiastic people that work at these resorts. that certainly is the case at the Iberostar Bavaro Suites. For those of you that noticed me with my video camera you probably recall how enthusiastic the Cooks, Servers, bartenders , entertainers were when I had the video camera on them. They truly wre amazing people ! I am really shocked at the minority that stated these people were unhappy! I totally disagree !!! Grade 10 out of 10. Food. ..I travel on buisness on a regular basis and i know great food. I am a very picky eater . The specialty restaruants were excellent. Japanese, Jambalaya and french were all well presented by the servers and excellent in quality. The dinner Buffett was also fantastic in quality and again the service throughout the complex. The only slight concern at the Specialty Restaraunts is the prompt  service. If you are the type of person that wants to get in and out. rush , rush? Then I would stay with the Dinners at the Main Buffett. Give yourself or your group at least 2 hours at dinner at the Special restaraunts. Also be prepared to Tip . If you are NOT a tipper you will not recieve the service as well as those that do tip. i averaged about $5 at each dinner for the waiter and greeter. All the resorts on Punta Cana play a game at the Restaraunts that they are full. NEVER are these restaraunts full. NEVER !! You vcan always get in if you tip a few $. Be sure to eat on wednesday evening at the Main buffett because of the Lobster Night. Incredible !!! Lunch at the Beach front area was very good as well.  Breakfast was average at best for some strange reason. I was not impressed with the Omlettes. Very Bland. Tasteless. Why? i cant figure out. stay away from the Bacon and so called sausage. Ick. strange that the Breakfast was below par vs the Lunch and dinners in the Resort. Overall grade 8 out of 10. Entertainment . This was truly impressive. The entertainers from the Dancers to the Singers were remarkable. Several Broadway Style shows every week. These entertainers were VERY talented . i was surprised at this resort vs the other Resort I was at two years ago. All entertainers wre enthusiaistic. Never appeared to be going through the motions. The 'Star Greeters and or dancers were everywhere with the audience each night getting you involved. however if you didint want to dance with them they would leave you alone. Never did I get the feeing that they were too in your face or pushy.  For those that have children and teens this IS the Resort for the families. the Star workers were everywhere on the grounds with activities for children , teens and adults. very impressive. If a child ot teenager is bored at the Iberostar its their OWN fault! There was always something for everone going on fronm the Beach are , Pool area , Lobby Bar etc. etc. Grade 10 out of 10. Room...very spacious and clean. Comfortable beds, to the sofa. very nice patio. the Bungalow style is a must . This is the Huge difference vs the other two Iberostars. NO Hotel style at the Bavaro Suites. I requested to be as close to the Beach as possible. I called 24 hours ahead for the request . I did end up just a short walk to the Pool and beach area. I tipped the Maid $4 each day with a Thankyou note and always asked for Mucho Aqua and Cervaso..Water and Beer. I could have had a few more towels each day. had problems with TV going on and off for some strange reason. Well air conditioned room with a ceiling fan. The light switiches can get confusing . Always tip your maid or housekeeper! Please remember that these workers are probably making around $3-4 per day salary. Sound from the outside does really carry into the room. Grade 8 out of 10. Overall view. Fantastic Resort for the $$. Though those of us this week had sub par weather . It rained hard 5 out of then 7 days. Only GOD can control weather. I would come back to the Iberostar Bavaro Suites anytime !! for those that give this resort a averager rating , I jsut cant understand how you can rate this resort that poor!?? Please remember that the dominican republic is 3rd world. This is NOT Cancun mexico. If you have a positive attitude and try not to look at everything on a negative appraoch you really would rate this resort above average.  Steve Mpls

<Content>Amazing Time We went to the Iberostar Bavaro from March 14-21st and we absolutely loved it!!! The weather was great (it only rained once for 5 minutes). There was plenty of good food and we loved the a la carte restuarants. The breakfast at the main buffet is excellent. Yes, we had some stomach issues (very minor) about the 3rd or 4th day but it wasn't something we couldn't handle. We brought our own drink mugs which I highly recommend for drinks by the pool/beach area. After a few days the bartenders were familiar with us/drinks by our mugs. We did the safari excursion and had a really good time (bring your camera). The grounds are beautiful and it was just as nice as we imagined it would be. I would definitely recommend this resort! P.S. Thank you for an amazing time Honey.

<Content>Fine, but a heads up Just got back from our annual March break. This year our family went to the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.I am an avid reader of Trip Advisor and find that everyone's imput is important in making up my mind about booking hotels. This year, I must say that I only read the reviews of this resort after we had already booked.I believe the reviews were fair and balanced.Here's my overview and I hope I can help others as much as they have helped me.We are a family of four who have been lucky enough to go away for at least 10 days every March to some where warm since our children were babies. Now they are 11 and 14.We had never been to the Dominican Republic and had heard that the beaches were beautiful and it was worth a look.The Bavaro was recommended to us because the DR doesn't have a broad selection of hotel types but the Iberostar offers a grouping of three hotels on its property. The Bavaro is its higher end hotel and it also offers two other hotels on the site, the Dominican and the Punta Cana (I think?), complete with casino; these hotels looked more like block style apartments.The good:The beach is truly lovely. The water clear and the coral very special. The people working there are very kind--if you try to speak Spanish, it's a plus. The grounds and the grounds teams are impressive. There is a large influx of cultures, US, Canada, Germans, French, Eastern European and Brits, which keeps things interesting and low key. Our two rooms were facing the beach and were pretty and well maintained. One of our showers wasn't working, and the front desk sent someone right away to fix it. It is a pretty property.The questionable:We travel alot . We brush our teeth with bottled water. We were very aware the DR has health issues. We still got violently ill the last week. And our family has never gotten sick any where else in the world. When we checked out, we met a family who also had similar dissentary symptoms. We took it in stride, but the food was a big disappointment and our family is a group who just look for a nice salad and a piece of grilled fresh fish. Pretty simple.The fish was scary. The fruit was lovely and the bread(imported) was very nice, but something was just....off.The bar and bartenders could not truly make a drink. You could get a beer or rum with one of the packaged mixers but that was it. And the bartenders were just plain unhappy. Unlike the waiters or other worker staff on the resort.If you are a child, you will love the food. Pizza, pasta, hot dogs, hamburgers. The breakfasts are very nice. The lunches, with bbq, are nice. The dinners a big disappointment. The wines are tough. If you are looking for heat, gorgeous beach, clean accomodation and everything else being fine, then I recommend the Bavaro. The other newer hotels looked like Vegas and not at all in keeping with the culture.But something was lacking at the resort. Tired bartenders, food that was too bland or that made us sick....things were fine, but not a hotel that I would recommend for any of the families that I know.It was fine. Fine. It you are starving for sun and greenery and water---we should count our blessings and this hotel has it. But, fine is a three star hotel in my book of travels. It all looks great on the surface but things were just ....fine.KateBoston

<Content>Shaken but not Stirred................... My lovely girlfriend and I just got back last night from a 7 night stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. I would classify both of as easy going and with realistic expectations when going on vacation. It was only the second time at all-inclusives for both of us.....the previous being to the Cancun area at different times in our lives..:-)Here are our thoughts....we actually jotted them done midweek knowing we wanted to give a review since it helped us in our decision making process.First of all, The resort is very beautiful. A very grand lobby welcomes you upon your arrival. We had very limited dealing with the front desk staff, but they got us checked in and checked out very quickly and courteously. After our check in we went to the Lobby Bar and was warmly greeted by Rafael with a Banana Mama...extra rum!!!We found all the people working at the resort to be very helpful, kind and happy for the most part. I do not speak Spanish, but it would certainly help...I felt at times the language barrier made it difficult for me to ask for what I wanted. Our room (1104) was very close to the main lobby area, which houses the entertainment stage. There was entertainment going on until 10:30 - 11:00 each night...not a huge bother to us, but I would recommend something closer to the pool/beach area...we also were awakened by mating peacocks each morning....I never knew how loud a mating peacock could be. I'm not sure why the resort feeds them...their annoyance outweighs their supposed charm.I agree with previous reviws regarding the musty smell in the room...we had our A/C running the whole time..and still had the dank, musty odor....It's all apart of being in a lush, tropical environment I guess... In hindsight we should have requested another room for really no other reason but to be away from the music and closer to the beach. But like I said we are pretty easy going...not big complainers.The food was ok.....this is one area I may be a bit pickier on....Albeit, plenty of food was there for the taking, the selection was limited and never seemed to change. I also felt the quality could have been a bit better, but once again the servers and preparers are all very friendly...don't shoot the messenger...If you eat at the buffet, sit at the far side...non-smoking Franklin Mota and Kathy Medina will take great care of you...We did 3 of the ala carte restaurants...actually did the Japanese twice, the Jambalaya and the Mexican...we did enjoy those very much..especially the atmosphere at the Jambalaya restaurant. We punished ourselves by going to the Mexican restaurant after a a few days of sensitive stomach..we definitely added insult to injury....If it just two people, sometimes you can slip into the ala carte restaurants with a $5 in your palm, shake the maitre d's hand and your in....It is a good way to shake the boredom of the buffetDrinks and bars.....Other than the beer and the pre-made slurpee drinks, it is hard to get a good handmade drink...the margaritas taste like bathroom cleaner. the tonic is funky so that messes up the rum, gin, vodka and tonic choice....the best bloody mary in the DR is on your flight shortly before landing and just after take-off. One gentleman told us the Palaypa Bar made a good Cosmo....his idea of a Cosmo must have been Fruit Punch and Vodka...Oh well enough with the drink thing, but when your chillin on the beach and all beered out...sometimes a good handmaid drink is what ya need...oh I just remembered...we had a good Rum and Coke and a decent Planters Punch....Excursions...tried to do the Catamaran sail to Sanoa Island...we were both not feeling weel so we reschudeled on the Marinarium trip....Marinarium was ok, swam in a pen with sharks and rays, but I would recommend the sail to Sanoa...it is all day, but worth it supposedly..We talked to a couple that did the 4-wheelers...sounded like they had fun...All in all, we had fun...weather was a bit hit and miss...had some sun, had some rain, had some clouds...I don't think we will go back to the DR. It was more crowded than we expected. We were also very surprised at how dirty it was....I mean with trash...literally garbage everywhere. I would think that the people and certainly the government would have more pride and respect for themselves and for the tourism industry and clean it up....Like I said the only other place I have been was the Cancun area, south of Playa Del Carmen...I realize that Mexico can be dirty, but it appears more of an organized kind of dirty, less trashy....The DR is trashy!!!

<Content>Loved the Iberostar Bavaro We just spent a week at the Iberostar Bavaro and loved it. The staff was wonderful, friendly and helpful. The buffet was great for breakfast and was ok at dinner. There were always basics such as pizza, french fries, meat and chicken, and many good desserts. The a la carte restaurants were from ok to excellent. We particularly liked the Gourmet restaurant , La Coupole and the Japanese restaurant. The entertainment was fun, especially if you participated. The beach was amazing and we had no trouble finding shaded areas. As for shopping, the beach tent shops are an experience. You can do well there if you bargain and are buying trinkets. Avoid the cigars as they are likely counterfeit. You're better off buying them at the Cigar shop at the Dominicana although they aren't cheap. If you want to buy rum, just buy it at the hotel as the prices are as good as anywhere. The casino at the Dominicana is small and smoky. If you want to catch up on sports, the Sports Bar at the Dominicana is nice.The suite was wonderful and the grounds are beautiful. This is truly all-inclusive and you really aren't expected to tip although leaving something in the room for the maid is a good idea and occasional tipping for special service is nice. There is always something to do if you want it but just enjoying the beach and the pool are enough.

<Content>Over Rated we visited Iberostar Punta Cana for our honeymoon and were told that we would be treated like a king and queen. Not so. We were placed next to the utility room (room 5120) and were awoken every day by 7:30am by noisy water pipes, the service entrance behind our room and the very noisy staff yelling across the hallways to one another. No welcome basket came to our room as we were told it would. On our 4th day a plate of cut fruit arrived with an invitation for a romantic dinner that ocurred the day before! That was our special thank you! Not the champagne, just maried t-shirts and fruit basket we were told was coming!The food was barely cooked. First day I bit into a raw piece of chicken at the beach bar. By day three I was eating rolls with butter..too afraid to eat the meat. Day 5 my new husbad ate 1/2 of a uncooked burger and had to induce vomitting to aviod illness. Luckily my husband speaks Spanish and the waiter told him to do so.Drinks were OK. Should have been blended not just poured, daquiri's were sour, and most drinks were served warm or with a slight chill. Do try the mamajuana... it's wonderful!Entertainment was totally amature. Not what we expected from a 5 star resort. how many nights in a row can they teach the bachata.Our honeymoon was a wedding gift from our parents so we didnt have to spend or save hard earned money. If it were our own money we would have been utterly dissapointed.PS... if you're a beach goer. Rise early and place towels on beach chairs... after 9am you'll be left with slim pickings. Also, ride the banana boat...it's cheap and a great time!

<Content>Bavaro is the place to stay This was our fist all inclusive and we were pleasantly surprised. We were traveling with two children 3 and 10; and we could not have been happier with the trip. A great vacation is so much about expectation management and perspective. The grounds of the Bavara are fabulous. The rooms more than adequate. My recommendation; call the day before departure to request your room preferences and they will be more than happy to try to accomodate. Do ask for a recently renovated room; we did not have one but I understand the bathrooms are new and improved. I agree, the rooms were a little musty - nothing the scented candle I lit did not solve. Although tipping is not required, a few dollars goes a long way. We enjoyed the activities and relaxing so much we chose not to do any excursions this time...we are saving that for next time because we will go back. The kids had a great time and the staff at the Bavaro were amazing. My last tip, when ordering rum drinks say con mucho Brugal and you will get a great drink with the good rum.

<Content>SImply First Class in Every Respect We just got back from a 1 week stay in the IB resort. As the title suggests, it was first class all the way. You will read other reviews (as we did) before selecting this resort. Bottom line - believe them. How can I best summarize? Well for starters, just go. You will not be disappointed. Summary - spotless, exceptionally scenic, absolutely amazing beach, great food both in terms of quality and selection and, as you would expect, no shortage, extremely friendly and helpful staff, large spacious rooms. Remember the line in Field of Dreams when Shoeless Joe asks Kevin Costner - is the heaven. That what you will be asking yourself.Now there will be those of you who may be offended by topless sun worshippers. Do not let this sway your decision. Yes, there are topless women but, so what. It's simply allowed. The beach. As I said it is amazing. To get the best location, we went down about 7 am and put our towels on a couple of chairs under one of many palm shade structers (I forget the name for them). We actually went down earlier the first morning to watch the sunrise. The water is warm and quite inviting expecially on a windy day with larger waves. Lots of beach walkers. You can go as far as you want in either direction.Food. As I said, great. They have a requirement in the a la carte restaurants that guys have to wear long pants. Bring a couple of pair of the lightest weight ones you have. It's very warm there even at night.Rooms. Very spacious and comfortable. They have an in-house safe that, for some reason is not included in the price. It's only $2/day and worth it. Everyone is very friendly but you never know and the resort is not responsible for articles missing from your room if the safe is not used.Grounds. Always kept spotless and very picturesque.Drinks. All included of course. The beer is cold and we found the pina coladas very refreshing. Of course we had to have several each day just to verify this.The are excursions to go on and the usual water sports but our plan was to do nothing for a week and I am happy to report, the plan worked. There is great snorkelling on the beach. You don't have to go far. One word of caution - swim along and admire what you see. If you put your hands out towards any fish, they are assuming you have food. One small fish came up and nipped me. No harm done and I actually found it quite amusing.I read one review that mentioned the very large men in speedos that the reviewier did not find very attractive. Let's be clear on this. You will see as many men (noticeably over weight) who should not be wearing speedos as you will women (also over weight)who should not be wearing 2 piece bathing suits. Well, that's just the way it is.Book your trip. You will not be disappointed.

<Author>OakvilleTravelTeam
<Content>A Fabulous Family Vacation We relied heavily on Trip Advisor for travel reviews and tips, photos and maps, valuable information provided. I will try not to be repetitive after having read a million reviews but this resort was more than we ever imagined. All the great reviews are true, the negative ones must be the jealous competition. We would go back in a heart beat. We traveled Transat Holidays Mar 8 鈥?Mar 15/06, 2 adults, 5 kids age 10, 11, 14, 16, 17 along with another family of 2 adults, 2 teens. We had never been to an all inclusive. This resort had something for everyone in our group, even the teens where it鈥檚 all about the party and the tan. You could choose your level of entertainment, chill by the beach/beach bar or be in all the activities by the pool. We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro. Any of the 3 Iberostar would be an excellent choice, it is all the same high level of standard. The only difference would be the room configuration.Staff 鈥?Fabulous, Friendly, Knowledgeable, multi-lingual, hard working, long hours, all just happy to please. Hospitality staff in Oakville should take a lesson from the Iberostar staff. Bring some small bills for tipping, not expected but appreciated. Staff cleaning your room may not be the same person every day. Every day we left a zip-lock bag with a few items from the dollar store, hair things, make-up, crayons, math activity books, Blue Jays baseball stuff, Canadian flag pins, gum and a few American dollars. If you don鈥檛 know any Spanish, learn a few of the basics before you go, the staff love to hear you at least try to speak it. Senior management was visible throughout the day in all areas as well. No line ups for drinks at the bar. This was not a resort that attracted the thousands of teen spring break partiers but enough teens to fill the disco.Buffets 鈥?beautiful presentation, elaborate carvings, many choices, and a suggestion - try something new, something you don鈥檛 cook at home, boiled banana for example. Beach buffet seafood paella day was fabulous. We didn鈥檛 try the hot dog/hamburger lunch, we can get that at home. If your favourite food is peanut butter and crackers then bring it with you, it鈥檚 not on the buffet. Lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, salads, pasta salads, fish, shell fish, fresh baked goods, made to order eggs. The kids got a thrill out of ordering room service 鈥渇or free鈥? The ice cream and ice cappuccino bar was a hit for the kids. I loved the Health Bar, fresh squeeze fruit and vegetable juice of your choice while you wait.A la carte 鈥?one first day of arrival we made our reservations for 4 nights. Restaurants do get booked up, everyone doing what we did but the restaurants weren鈥檛 full, people book but don鈥檛 show up and don鈥檛 think to cancel the reservationsRooms 鈥?Our family had 3 suites, all on the beach near the beach bar, great spot, close to everything. Rooms spacious, clean, bar fridge with bottled water, beer, pop, coffee maker, hair dryer. Air conditioning was fine, only turns on when the doors are closed, makes sense. There is a safe in the closet for your valuables. Some rooms with walk in showers, some with bidets, tubs with hand showers, water pressure was not a problem. Grounds 鈥?Very picturesque, Full staff of people looking after every detail from gardening to cleaning, nothing out of place. Walkways can be slippery when wet just like the sign says.Activities 鈥?Join in! Try a Spanish lesson, dance lesson, scuba in the pool, beach volleyball, water polo, kayak race in the pool, BINGO, sailing, air rifle, pass the banana, bikini contest鈥︹€?br/>Beach 鈥?fine white sand, cleaned every morning, raked in the afternoon, always a bit of wind to take the heat off. Always lounges available. Sunscreen is a must and lots of it often, even for those that say they never burn. Bring lots, very expensive at the resort. Lots of walking traffic along the beach.Pool 鈥?clean, refreshing, nice mix of sun and shade areas, we did reserve our lounges around 8:30 a.m. on the 2 pool days but only because we were 11 people. Lounges were available, people do move around during the day.Security 鈥?no worries with teenagers walking to the Disco after midnight, golf cart transport is available, security around pool and beach very visibleCasino 鈥?smoke filled, not our thing but had to see it Entertainment 鈥?MC spoke in 4 languages, lots of talent, improved lighting would show off the talent, costume and choreography Disco 鈥?starts to get busy just before midnight, teens had a great time, adults didn鈥檛 worry about safety. Teens may NEED to check their email in the internet caf茅 $$Resort shopping 鈥?check the prices at the resort before going to the beach market. Beach market is a fun experience, lots to pick from, bring small bills.Negatives 鈥?None as far as Iberostar goes. A few guests with no manners and the smokers. Non-smoking areas do not exist. Ashtrays are provided but smokers would toss a butt in the sand and not think about the barefoot kid that may step on it. Suggestion: we purchased our $10 tourist card with our plane ticket before leaving Canada, age 14 and up do need photo ID, passport is best, put aside your exit money for the trip home, bring lots of small bills for tipping, put a dryer sheet in your suit-case, bring extra sun screen and small first aid kitOakville, Ontario

<Content>I want to go back!!! We just returned from a girls week at the Iberostar. I must say it was a wonderful week. It did not rain except for the last day we were checking out, not a cloud in the sky on the other days. The mainland was cloudy, which led me to beleive that was why the weather channel says it rains there everyday. A couple tips:Families with kids, definatly bring two way radios, it is great to give to the kids, they will not have to hang out with you all day.Insulated cups a must, the bartenders will rinse them out and fill them up with whatever you want!!May I suggest the Mimosas, wonderful, I am pretty picky with my cocktails, so this made an easy make and very refreshing!!Definatly bring immodium, we were very careful about not drinking the water, but myself and my sister both got sick one day. Not too bad, just drink lots of bottled water. The front store sells bottled water if you run out in your room, by the end of the week we were just filling up our cups and the empty bottles at the soda station at the buffets, it is located on the right of the machine.A big one... Verizon cell phones work, some people said they had better reception there than at their homes.Remember, the resort is catering to mostly europeans, the food is very different from what you usually eat!! The fruits, vegetables, and cheeses are wonderful!!! Speaking of fruits, if you plan on drinking pina coladas all day, stay away from fruit during your meals (fruits are a natural dieretic!! Just a tip!!)Anyone buying cigars, stick with the shop at the Dominicana, the cigars from the beach are very, very dry, not even a humidor can save!!!Internet is offered at the Dominicana, $5 for a half an hour. If you do not already have an email account that you can log into, it will be difficult to use, I watched a very angry man yell at the poor attendant.Hope this helps, we had a great time and can not wait to go back!!

<Content>Won't Return! This was our second trip to the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana. We will not be back. To accommodate the guest is not this resorts objective. Trying to get four rooms (we booked 7 months ago) on second floor in close proximity-well let's just say it could not be accomplished. We did get close proximity after waiting several hours (from 3-6:00 pm)...however, 3 rooms were on the bottom floor  the mold  musty smell was really bad. Also, should mention: plumbing problems...a blocked toilet, showers that did not drain, lot's of those little black ants, mini fridge that got as cold as room temp ... and a mattress that should have been replaced MANY sleeps ago  if you want to have the slider doors lock on these first floor rooms - you will have to make this request at the front desk (more than once).The grounds of this hotel are beautiful. The beach is excellent. The food is plentiful; but none of it was ever good in the opinion of the nine of us. Bartenders, servers, maids, groundkeepers all warm friendly and eager to pls. The front desk - they tell you they are here to make you happy -well don't count on it without a fight!

<Content>Bravo to Bavaro We were there for 1 week Feb 25- Mar 3, 2006 with 3 other couples. Found the facility surpisingly clean, the staff gracious, and the Entertainment Team a blast.Hats off to Huck(thanks for the Tennis), Ceasar, Anna Bannana, Darkie, Isabella, Johanna, and the rest of the gang for there hard work and keeping the activities rolling. You do not have to participate, but if you do, prepare yourself (good fun). Our only complaint was we found ourselves assigned a room with 2 single beds, but after the first night we were able switch to a King suite the next day. The food was good. I didn't expect that! The specialty restaurants are a must. We especially enjoyed Jambalaya. Emmanuel,our waiter at Breakfastwas most attentive. Some of the shows that are put on in the evening almost match Las Vegas productions, very enjoyable. Maid service was good.Plenty of food,drink,dancing and relaxation (if you want)!If the rest of the Ibero Star's are run like this one, I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.

<Content>Beautiful Beach Iberostar Bavaro Feb 25 - Mar 4, 2006Pros * Great beach, best beach we've been too better than Playa Del Carman, or Cancun. * Great landscaping, with palm trees and flowering bushes lining the paths, and these are lighted at night. * Abundant beach and pool chairs with a lots of shade. You don't have to get up early to get a good chair in the shade by the pool or on the beach!* Check-in  check-out, very efficient and very fast. * Rooms were clean. We were on the first floor, ground level, and had some spiders, an a couple of mosquitoes, nothing bad. * Staff, very friendly and hard working. * No sand fleas, like we've ran into in Mexico. Cons * Our room was in desperate need of refurbishing. Everything was well worn and in need of replacement. While the rooms are called suites they're more like regular rooms with a couch and coffee table. The bed was soft, the couch hard, and the throw pillows smelly. The air-conditioning was a simple switch with high, medium and low. Room walls are thin and you can easily hear conversations of people walking by. The window and patio door locks were in such bad shape that they were almost useless. Misc * Food - Buffet, breakfast was ok, you could get eggs cooked to your preference, lunches were pretty good, hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza plus a daily special, the evening buffet was just ok. * Food - Specialty restaurants. While they don't tell you this until you check in, they only guarantee 3 specialty restaurants reservations for a seven night stay. Overall the specialty restaurant food was ok to good. Check the menu before making a reservation, the Mediterranean restaurant for example only has sea food. * Most of the guest we're European, so there was some topless sun bathing on the beach.Bottom-line Enjoyed the Bavaro beach area and would recommend it, however I wouldn't recommend Iberstar Bavaro until its refurbished.

<Content>Good value Hello. My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Iberostar Bavaro (February 28 - March 5. Here are some thoughts on the Iberostar Bavaro that you might find helpful.Grounds - fantastic. Truly beautiful! Very exotic with birds, etc.Restaurant, bar, etc. - The ala carte restaurants were very nice. Our fav was Jambalaya. Nice for a romantic dinner. The lobby bar was great. Kennedy and Salas took great care of us. We didn't care as much for the pool bar. I must say that the public bathrooms at this place are some of the nicest I have ever encountered. Even the ones by the pool!Food - breakfast buffet (we liked the pool best) and dinner at ala cartes - wonderful. The buffet was a mad house. No sense of lines, pushing, etc. I recommend waiting until LATE if you do the buffet.Rooms - a disappointment. Not disgusting, but ours could certainly use a lot of work. Luckily the weather was great and we didn't need to be in there that often. I did notice a mild smell, but the candles we brought took care of it and it was not overpowering.Pool - get there early if you want a good spot. I would say no later than 10:00 am. Lots of kids/families when we were there. That is fine, but some parents did not have a good handle on the little ones. The deep side of the pool is much better for this reason. The pool is nice, but it needs to be resurfaced on the bottom. No big deal, but some chipping, etc.Beach - very nice. The water was very pretty. We went by the huts but didn't buy anything.Spa - okay. The massage is good. I would not recommend the facial or at least not the 90 minute facial. FYI - if you are modest, beware! They don't use sheets! Merely a towel to cover you so not much is left to the imagination.Tours - we did the snorkeling/booze cruise. I don't recommend it. You see a lot of fish, but it is so crowded you also get kicked in the head by fins a lot. The tour bus driver also hit a dog on our way and as an animal lover, I found this to be a bit traumatic. You can swim with the nurse sharks/stingrays, but this is in a caged area. My husband and I opted not to do this portion. It was packed and didn't seem the most desirable way to see them.Overall, if you want a good value this is the trip for you. We were following a budget on this trip so all-inclusive was the way to go. I am not sure we would go back unless the property had been renovated a bit. The resort had lots of activities for kids and seemed to be great for families.I would be happy to answer any questions you have!

<Content>Noise, not nature if you want a beautiful, romantic, natural beach STAY AWAY!!!! The food and service was okay, the rooms were clean enough--for a 2 1/2 star. To eat in their restaurants, you must book before you go; otherwise it's the same old pizza, etc buffet. But worst of all, was the incessant noise that was EVERYWHERE. Couples beware!!!

<Content>Kickin it with TR and MR in Iberostar Bavaro We started to plan this trip in mid December of 2005, going into the beginning of January 2006. we had no prior knowledge of IBEROSTAR and what we were in for. I started to track reviews of (3) different hotels and we narrow it down to this hotel. I tracked the reviews once a week until the day we left.  Just spent (6)days 02/26- 03/03 with our great and close friends in this hotel. We were looking to get away and what a great place to pick for our first time. Arrival:We arrived on a flight about 12:30 P.M. we went through customs and got our bags. Yes, You have to get your picture taken and pay the $10 entrance fee. Fill out the (BLUE CARD)paperwork on the plane.The picture will be available for you when you leave. Actually, we did buy the picture when we left. Your transportation is 50 yards away. we walked out and met the VIP rep and we were in the bus in (3-5) minutes.. In other reviews someone mentioned about having a couple 'cool ones' for the road on the bus. The bus trip is about 30-40 minutes from the airport, depending on how many potholes you hit. I would wait to start the party til after you get checked in. Or, at least in the lobby, like we did!! Grounds: Everyone says it, it is absolutely beautiful. It was very relaxing to go back and forth from the beach. Walking to and from dinner was very nice, or, walking anywhere was very nice. The grounds are always being maintained. the PEACOCKS are very pretty during the day, wait til your sleeping.. remember they live here to. Rooms:I originally wanted and was hoping for oceanfront rooms with kingsize beds. We got the kingsize beds. Did not have a problem with the odors in the room. You are in a foriegn country.. It will not be like the Hilton. We had maid service every day and the fridge was stocked every day, it was clean and well kept. We did tip the maid on a daily basis, our friends elected to tip at the end of the stay. We saw no measurable diffence in service. One thing is very clear, they work very hard, so please be generous. Food/Dinners: This is a tough one to write about.. We had trouble making reservations for the ala carte resturants. We did get reservations for the Steakhouse and the Cajun. We eat very late 9 p.m seatings. For both of them. The food and service was excellent at both. We decided to experiement and we decided to walk into the Seafood resturant at about 8:30. We 'greased' some palms, and 'bingo' we had a table. So have fun with it. We ate at the buffet one night as well as the starrock cafe very good and alot of fun. We ate lunch at the beach which had a very wide varity of food. If you go hungry, it will be by your own doing. We found no real reason to leave the beach once we got here. We were careful not use the tap water for anything other than bathing. (we put a towel over the spicket) We used the bottle water for brushing our teeth. Please check the seals on the bottle water, I DID find bottles that appeared to be filled with NO LABELS on them. I emptied them out didn't use them.I did have mixed drinks with the ice in it, however, I did not drink the water from anything other than the sealed bottle that I opened.. I did have a touch of sickness the day I left. I am not sure I want to attribute that to something, specifically, I ate. I took some medicine and it went away just in time for the bus run. THANK GOODNESS Beach/recreational activities: DO NOT MISS the travel agent orientation on your first full day. They will try and help you make smart choices. Some of these activities are complete days away from the resort. Some have more travel involved then the actual activity. So be careful.The staff activities were very fun, we did not participate, but, the staff did a fantastic job trying to interact with the guests. They do speak multiple languages and do it very well. The other activities such as scuba diving and parasailing are not as organized as they could be. If you have not scuba dived before, this probably is not the place to start. Parasailing we had a 3:30 time, we finally go it done by 5:30. Delays and delays so be prepared. THe refund policy is no refunds... O.K. the beach... It was very beautiful and it was windy, It is the ocean, you will always have a breeze. Don't worry about. Go to the pool which is 20 feet away from the beach. O.K the worst part of the beach, was seaweed, and the rocky bottom, it was very difficult to walk without cutting your feet. Bring watershoes. You can wade through the seaweed, to the clear water, but, the rocky bottom was diffcult to deal with, no matter where you were. Bring the water shoes and have a good time, we did drink as much as we wanted, when we wanted. As always, we enjoyed our Happy Hours with 'TR' and 'MR' at the beach. We really didn't go to any of the real late night life/clubs, the clubs don't really get going til 10:30. and they were a good 20 minute walk away. We're really more beach nuts than anything. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and thought we made an excellent choice in Hotels. I would recommend IBEROSTAR-BAVARO to my friends. For us, I think we want to visit other islands, before coming back any time soon. O'LA!!

<Content>What more could you want? My family and I just returned last night from a one week stay at the Bavaro. We've been at this resort about 4 years ago and must say it even more beautiful then before. The bottem line is that this resort has everything your looking for in a getaway. Yes you can nick-pick about this or that but in the all and all, these place has everything.

<Content>Great place if you're not a picky eater It's been a year since I stayed here so things might have changed. I'm inspired to write now because am heading back to the DR in a few days and I'm very disappointed that I'm not staying at Iberostar Bavaro. I booked a couple months ago and was told Iberostar wasn't taking reservations. Too bad.Staff was super. Very friendly and many spoke English. I do speak a little Spanish and the non-English speaking staff was patient with me as I tried to get my point across in their language. They were very appreciative of tips, especially the maids. A++Bars: Important tip: if you want booze in your drinks, you must say so. I drank virgin pina coladas for three days before I figured out why I wasn't getting tipsy!! A-Beach was gorgeous. A++Pools were gorgeous too, loved the swim-up bar. A+Massages on the beach were inexpensive and pretty good, though I've bad better. Couldn't complain given the price and the atmosphere. A-Only went on one sidetrip, the Jungle Safari. Definitely worthwhile. Bring sunscreen and bring candy or trinkets for the Domenican children. They'll swarm you for it, so be sure the shy kids get some too. Other people we met went on the dolphin swim and were disappointed. AThe entertainment was pretty lousy so don't waste your time with it. I'd give it a C at best.My only complaint is the casino staff. Rude and nasty. They got mad if the table was winning and kept changing dealers and rushing you if you were winning. I give the casino a C, but that's only because I won a little money. If I hadn't won, I'd have to give them a D!Trolley service was usually good but sometimes the waits were kind of long, but usually not too bad. Give that a B.The food ... well, remember you're in a foreign country. You're not going to get American food. Was disappointed generally but always found something edible at the buffets. Liked that the lunch buffet was right next to the pool so it was convenient. I'm coming prepared with peanut butter and crackers this trip. Food: C.Had no trouble getting reservations at al la cartes, but the food wasn't all that much better than at the buffets. The Mexican restaurant was good and we went there twice. Al la cartes: C+Souvenirs: Rum is cheap. Larimar from beach vendors is cheap and you get what you pay for. Coffee is delicious. Bring home lots or you will regret it later when you run out. I feel like a stupid American to say this, but the beach vendors are obnoxious. Don't go unless you have a high tolerance for persistence and unless you are comfortable giving a firm no and walking away. Don't try to be polite or they will follow you around until you buy something.

<Content>Great Place, Great Time!!! We just got back from 7 days in the Iberostar Bavaro. I have to say that is a Great Hotel. The rooms are big, pretty and clean (The bathroom was ok) The location is great and the beach beatiful. We (me and my husband) had a great, wonderful, time there. The staff is really friendly and hepful, the shows are great, so is the music. The disco was ok (too many teens when I stay) The food at the bufetts is good, not great. Don麓t go to the Mediterranean Rest. is not that good. Jambalaya and La Coupule are really better.We are 29. There wasn麓t many people in our age, but was ok, we have plenty of time for each other. The whole vacations was a dream come true.I can麓t believe that some people write that the rooms smells, or complain about making reservations, because that is so easy, and the girl at the desk is friendly, and you have to go to the lobby everyday anyway, because of the bar, or the shows. Don麓t believe those reviews. I was there and was absolutely great, awesome!!!!I have left so many things good to say about this hotel ... If you have the chance, GO!!!

<Content>If you want a great vacation resort... OK...while I still remember.If you're looking for an urban, busy, American style hotel with high tipping expectant staff who cater to your every whim and speak English to you, stay home.On the other hand, if you want gorgeous beaches, extremely friendly staff who will really work hard to understand you and please you, immaculately kept grounds, delicious foods and great fresh tropical fruits, low keyed relaxing atmosphere, check this resort out! Here are my comments from our departure:Air carrier: SkyService from Ottawa. Left 2 hours late due to HIGH winds and flight delays...not their fault. Meal on plane was actually quite good.Arrival in Punta: 2 a.m. so no traffic, no crowds at airport. Customs pretty fast. Shuttle to resort good, although lost one passengers luggage so we had to wait 1 hour for processing and paperwork. Could have done that next day as all travellers were tired!Resort checkin: No crowds. Pleasant staff. Efficient checkin. Normally you leave your bags there and they deliver to your room. At 3 a.m. we dragged them to the room, which was only 100 yards or so. Not a problem!Room: Very clean. Spacious. Air conditioned. Attracitive. Bright. Well appointed. The only problem we had was we asked for 1 king and got 2 doubles. But did not ruin our vacation at all. Small fridge in room stocked with bottled water, soda and beer. We were told to check caps on water to make sure not filled from tap. Found 1 or 2 with suspect tops...may have been only a problem at bottling plant, but we didn't drink potentially tampered bottles. Fridge kept well stocked. Meals: Well prepared, tasty. Not 5-star gourmet, but great variety. Be careful, though. Many foods not used to eating; many rich. Got sick one day, but not sure if too much food, too varied of foods from usual diet, or possibly food poisoning...most definitely did NOT ruin vacation.Grounds: Amazing. Great attention to detail. Clean. Well maintained. Someone always painting, cleaning, pruning trees, removing limbs and coconuts, watering flowers, sweeping, mowing, mopping, buffing and so forth. Buildings: Extremely well kept, well lit, clean, open.Walkways: Well maintained, but as you will see elsewhere and as advertised on many signs around resort, VERY slippery when wet. Be careful.Staff: Activity staff. Their job is to make your vacation fun. And they do it! If you are not having fun, it is your fault. They mostly all know Spanish, English, German and French...so there is no reason to not get involved. Do the activities. Dance. Swim. Water aerobics. Volleyball. Pool volleyball. Spanish lessons. Air rifles. Archery. Kayak. Snorkel. Sail. And many more. They are there for you. Use them. Hotel staff. Very attentive and pleasant. Most upper staff speak many languages, room staff usually only Spanish. Small gifts (lotion, coloring books, crayons) and tips greatly appreciated.  Dining staff: very friendly and attentive. Learn a few names and stay with them for the week...they will make sure you have great dining experiences. Beach: White. Soft. Very clean. Getting sun shack (palapa) was not a problem for us, but the premier location units went fast. If toplessness bothers you, look some other direction. Nobody really cares much and it is, as far as I could see, not a big thing to worry about.  Sports: Kayaking, snorkeling, sailing included in deal. You get 1 hour per day of each, but I don't think anyone really counts too hard. Sailing usually booked early, so make reservation. Other activities: lots to do. We danced at nearly every activity...I'm not a dancer, but staff worked hard to untwist my feet. Rating the staff during our stay, we agreed that the men were generally friendlier and better to dance with than the women, but all provided a great time.I can provide links to my photos upon email request. Be happy to answer any questions.I would definitely recommend this resort.

<Content>Great Resort but watch out for... Just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro and had a great time. - Great weather- Great property- The staff can't do enough for you- Real nice room- A great supply of quality food and drink.- Fantastic beach and pool- Fun activities if you choose to participateOverall a great family trip.A few things to watch out for. The paid-for water sports and excursions (those not included in the all-inclusive rate). Once booked forget about any refund or rescheduling for any reason including illness or change of plans. Be very careful not to book to far in advance in case you don鈥檛 feel up to the activity. Carlos at the water-sport desk will sell anything to any age or ability person and think nothing of taking your cash for some activity that may not be suitable for you or your children. He鈥檒l sell an open water snorkel trip to a kid who can鈥檛 swim or fit into a mask and then refuse to refund your cash.Be careful of 鈥淒ominican Dietary Distress鈥? At least one person from each family will certainly get a huge case of digestive discomfort. Although the food is good quality avoid the water and all raw vegetables and go very easy on the fruits.

<Content>Just returned from Bavaro! Returned from the DR on Feb.24. Really enjoyed the grounds and the pool! Sunrise and sunsets were stunning.Our room was a challenge to manage! Little black flies were every where! This and the smell were untolerable. Being in the plumbing business I recognized an open drain which allowed the flies and the odor to occupy the room. With some difficulty I was able to have the problem rectified through the on site plumber. The hotel was responsive and did fix the problems.If your interested in getting a reservation at one of the many themed restaurants you will need to have a reservation, and you need to make it in person! You will also notice while dining the restaurants only seat 50% of the capacity, which means you will be told the restaurants are sold out but when your there you will see they are not. You will need to make your own observations!The staff are excellent and hard working, most of the staff work over 12 hours per day. You will see them in the morning and later on that night they will be performing another function. Great people.Overall we were satisfied, we have stayed at the Mayan Riviera last year and were constantly comparing the two against each other.

<Content>Just Do it. Such a great experience! Definately one of the best resorts we've been to. My husband and I have been to the Moon Palace, Riviera Maya '00, Melia Caribe, Punta Cana '02, Sandals Negril, Jamaica '03. All of the resorts were different and had something special to offer, however the Iberostar Bavaro met all of our specific requirements we had for this trip and then some.Our experience mirrored the positive reviews:-Gorgeous, beautiful beach (snorkling right there)-great food, even the beef. (the secret is in the ordering and the expectation)-Immaculate grounds-Excellent service.If you are looking for an Americanized resort this is not the place for you. If you enjoy meeting and vacationing with people from all over the world, trying their foods and the foods of the country you are in, Go. If it is more fun for to you to try to communicate with people who speak other languages than getting things just so, Go. This was the first year we traveled with my 4 year old and my mother-in-law. Our daughter is a very active child who loves being with us and also loves organized activities and meeeting new kids. We really wanted her to have the option of a great,safe kids club. We couldn't have had a better experience. Lucy's Club runs from 10am to 5pm. You are given a schedule and may pick the kids up and drop them off at any time. Archery, water balloon fights, tennis, soccer and football are just some of the activities. We would sneak around and spy on our daughter for the first few days and were totally pleased. If it was up to her, most days she would have stayed longer than we allowed her to stay (a couple of hours) (We missed her). Its amazing to see kids who don't all speak the same language overcome it and just have a great time.Lucy's Club then resumes at 8:00pm each night with a kids show (dancing, talent show, play) that they participate in. Fantastic. After their show begins the adult show starts and they will take the kids to a big room close by where they play games and watch videos if you want. We also also met some wonderful families and kids at the kids shows and just hanging at the pool. Doug, Marianne and fabulous dancer Miss Sarah. Adam, Jan, Miss Belle and Miss Maeve of the beautiful braids. Great resort for (but not overrun by) kids in our opinion. My Mother-in-law has definate issues with walking long distances. In the beginning we called for rides on the golf cart which worked well. However when the Jersey in her kicked in and she didnt want to wait the 5 or 10 minutes, she was able to walk the length of the Bavaro. The grounds being so beautiful it was a pleasure, she said. There are also lovely rest stops where she could sit under cover and take a break. Plus once you are where you need to be you really don't have to leave until the next meal. The zero entry pool was a huge plus for her and the beach was short enough and the waves gentle enough that she could also navigate them. I would recommend taking a thermous mug for the beach, this also cut down on going back and forth to get drinks. I could go on and on but I would just be rehashing alot of information that is already in the existing reviews.I hope the information regarding our specific needs will help other people who need the same information. I also hope the general information will be of help. Good Luck and Happy Travels!

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro Highly Recommended I have to say I work at a travel agency and this was my first all inclusive and it was wonderful. From the friendly staff to the accommodations that were very nice at the Bavaro, we had three people in a room and it worked out fine. The beach and the pools were so clean and the weather was unbelievable everyday we were there. I would highly recommend this Iberostar Property.

<Content>Friendly weather! Just got back 2/17 with a group of 10 friends of an 8 day stay. We all agreed that this was the best resort of our last 7 trips and we will go back next year. The grounds were beautiful and constantly maintained as was the public space. That week the suites were being stocked with coffee makers, thank God! The beach was plentiful with chairs and palapas for shade. So much to do with a full daily schedule of activities should you choose to participate, and we all did!! The peacocks on the grounds gave such an exotic feel as well as the flamingos in the lake next to the main restaurant.  Even though they NEVER solicit tips, please leave a buck daily for the housekeeper and waitstaff per meal, it means so much to them. The activity staff goes above and beyond and they are a riot. You will talk about them the rest of the year. When the guys dress up as the Baywatch babes and run along the beach you will split your sides. They get you up and moving, hey, get your monies worth! We had more fun than what we paid for!! It was great to play bocci, take dance lessons, play darts and yoga with people from different countries. Don't forget to tip the guy $2 bucks when he handrolls you a free cigar next to the Star Rock Cafe and cigar shop. What a treat...The nite time entertainment was exellent especially the audience participation.The food was outstanding and more than plentiful.Our group especially enjoyed the mussels (huge and not one bit of grit) served every which way daily. The lobster salad in the gourmet restaurant, well, no words to describe. The fruit was my favorite each morning along with made to order eggs. And the fresh baked goods was melt in your mouth. -Tile everywhere, wear sandals with even a little traction on the soles for walking with confidence.-Wear a waterproof watch to keep you on schedule for activities. The catamaran was a blast (buy the lesson , worth it)-Bring a nite lite for the bathroom-Tip the housekeeper with small things like a box of crayons (for her kids) or fragrance samples, cheap jewelry, makeup, toothbrush/paste etc... They will extra stock your mini fridge with your requests!-Bring a coffee thermos for coffee or tea on the beach when you just can't do one more beer-Take lots of $1 bills for tips (if you choose) or the flea market vendors. hats $4, swim suit wraps no more than $10, t-shirts not more than $6. -Drink plenty of bottled water, the hot sun will catch up to you.I could go on and on. My advice... Just go!!!

<Content>heaven without the funeral! This is a stunningly beautiful resort! The Bavaro is the best of the three Iberostars on the island, we think. We were blown away the whole week. I want to go back!First, THE BEACH: Beautifully clear, warm aqua water and some small action but no undertow at all. You CAN swim in the water if you can swim in a large lake. It is very safe to float out to the rope (over everyones' head and right before the real waves), and we saw many people swimming and snorkling with no problems at all. If you are a poor swimmer (as I am) I would recommend a flotation devise Or just dip  float. The FOOD: There are two buffets open here, one by the water and one near the lobby. The first has a european style breakfast, with fresh fruits, crossants, fresh juice, coffee, meats..lunch there is snacky foods, hot dogs, burgers, fries, pizza, and fresh bbq. The bars near beach and pool were first rate.The larger buffet has a beautiful breakfast and FANTASTIC dinner. We saw gourmet cheeses, fresh baked bread, goulash, susi, prime rib, kababs, scallops, mini lobster, shrimp, pasta, chowder, and more !! AND desserts galore. We only tried one reserve it style restaurant  it was great for atmosphere but the food was just as good at the buffet. *BURP*THE STAFF: VERY young, very friendly, and multi lingual. Our room sparkled, and when we asked we recieved very prompt service always. Very few people we saw tipped at all...We did anyhow. You should too. I did not notice any difference in service, however.Only one small (very small) complaint: The public areas are all smoking areas, with no no smoking areas to be found. This is especially unpleasant near the bars at night.

<Content>Great stay in Feb-06 We also returned Feb 9th. My wife and I are 48 and 44 we took my mom and dad and brother. My parents are 78 yrs old and loved it. My brother is 50 and recently divorced he also loved it. My wife and I have other resorts to compare this to, we have been to St Lucia, Costa Rica, Panama, Cayman, Jamaica, all the hot spots in Mexico, multiple cruises, and Domican at Sunscape last year and we would rate this very good, you will get your money鈥檚 worthTHE WINDThe Beach is what everyone said in detail except we liked the wind and it was not that strong, I never got sand in my drink, ever. Also I liked the wind because I like to lay in the sun without boiling, it was perfect. A few days later in the day we used the pool area it was much hotter there a perfect place to get out of the wind if you don鈥檛 like wind.BEACH The topless factor was a plus for my brother, some at our resort but mostly by the Dominican but scattered everywhere, after awhile it was pretty normal. We would fill a Beefeaters and Tonic and walk the beach down past the Dominican and beyond to the RIU resorts, then head back. The first Iberostar property you come to is the Punta Cana, we would fill up with a Bahama Mama then walk past Dominican and be back to the Bavaro. The beach is made for walking it鈥檚 great. My wife and I spent 2 hours shopping one day at huts down the beach, didn鈥檛 buy much excepts a few shirts and wooden bowls but it was fun. Expect to pay 33% of what they ask. There are a few things they won鈥檛 budge more than 50% but most items are negotiable.FOODThe Buffet is great, lots of unusual foods along with the standard foods. People mention the lobster in the buffet, but these we very small lobster, not like you are picturing. The wine is good, not great but good. The service is perfect and always with a warm genuine smiles. So many of the workers have perfect super white teeth. We were there 7 days and asked to book 4 of the restaurants and they didn鈥檛 have any problem with this.The Japanese was great, even thought they didn鈥檛 cook in front of you. Our service was top notch and they understood enough English, which was nice. Ask for Amaretto here and you will get the good stuff from Italy not the cheap stuff they have at every bar. We also had the top shelf rum call anjeo or something like that. My wife had Baileys and it was the real thing. The Jambalaya was our second best we loved it. The third being the Seafood and last the Steakhouse, it wasn鈥檛 bad but the atmosphere wasn鈥檛 the best. People mentioned on the boards they had Alan Jackson playing and thought that was weird, well that was better than what we had there was no music and it was dead only 5 other tables in the whole place. I had the Chicken and everyone else had the Rib Eye, everyone was happy.SHOWSThe first 2 nights the shows were very entertaining after that they went down hill, but it was something to do since the Disco wasn鈥檛 open yet and no one was really in the Star Rock until later. One night they brought different couples from different countries on the stageThe women would have to put a quarter into the butt (pants on)of their spouse. He then would have to squeeze  hop across the stage the squat and drop the quarter into the mixed drink glass. We all laughed seemed pretty uncomfortable but it was funny. They did multiple other stunts like this, but I don鈥檛 want to give them all away.Star RockIf you are addicted to Karaoke and do it a lot at home you will not like it. There is only one songbook that they rip pages out of the 3 ring binder and pass them around. I wanted sing a particular song so I looked and didn鈥檛 find it. So then you need to take your 3 pages and walk across the room and exchange these 3 with Germans or French that couldn鈥檛 understand why you wanted to have their pages and why they would want yours. The songs were not listed by title or artist as with any other karaoke bar listed them by disc number, which is really odd. It was still fun and it wouldn鈥檛 stop me from going back, but the song selection was terrible and they only did it for one hour each night. The Pool tables in the Star Rock were worn, and crooked again really bad we were laughing it was such a joke, the felt was worn to the bone. They are so great at maintaining the floors and the grounds I couldn鈥檛 understand how they could be so oblivious to this. The worst dump bar by my house would look like the Ritz compared to these. Do not eat hot dogs from the little bar between the Star Rock and the Disco. I ate one at 1a.m. When I bit into the hot dog it was cold and gray, I thought it was odd and I said this doesn鈥檛 taste good but I鈥檓 hungry, I hope I don鈥檛 get sick. The next 30 hours I had severe diarrhea sweats, chills, etc, then I got better and everything was fine. For one day I though I might not make it though. My guess it was the hot dog, my family all ate everything except that. I鈥檓 thinking it was floating in the bad water, not the purified water to stay warm which is wasn鈥檛 warm. I knew better when I bit into it , but did it anyway, just a word of caution, if its not hot and it鈥檚 meat don鈥檛 eat it.DemographicsIt was like everyone said on the boards about 15% American which was very nice. We loved mixing with all the other countries. I really didn鈥檛 see the rudeness that others have talked about. I did get stepped in front of a few times at the buffet lines but they didn鈥檛 look bossy or anything I think that鈥檚 just some peoples culture, it was not a problem.Sanoma IslandYes it was a 1.5-hour bus ride at least each way. We didn鈥檛 mind the length because it was a nice tour of the country. We did the Outback Safari last year; see a lot of the country on this tour also. Once you get there you are in Caribbean water vs. the Atlantic by the Hotel. The water is warm and you can see all of the way to your feet. The Catamaran was fun, many opportunities for pictures, the rum was below average and the beer was good. Once you get to the island you could lay in the sun, play volleyball, take walks, etc. The food was decent and they had an open bar. I would take the trip again because being on the boat was fun and you can get some great pictures of the lush palms on the islands and it was a nice change on day 5 to do something different.RoomsOur room was fine after my wife called someone to get the huge toad out from behind out toilet. She went into the bathroom when we checked in, wasn鈥檛 in their long and then I heard a little scream and she came running out, that鈥檚 when we found our new friend, the staff came and put him back into the pond by our building. We didn鈥檛 have the little ants people talk about, but my parents in the same building did. We kept our A/C on low all of the time and it was fine. My parents turned it off quite a few times and then mentioned at breakfast how their clothes were always damp. Hmmmm.When Our refrigerator stopped working and we had someone there in 5 min. The slider didn鈥檛 lock well and the reason I checked it is because I saw on many other posts that it didn鈥檛. It would lock but if you shook it back and forth 6 times like an intruder it would open every time, not very secure. We just shoved the table in front of it when we slept, and didn鈥檛 have any problems. We found out the third day we were there the windows on the side weren鈥檛 locked either. The safes are a great size, use them. I thought the beer in the room wasn鈥檛 very good, Presidente is much better, but they wouldn鈥檛 give you this in the room.The service and cleanliness were very good.ShopsI thought they were reasonable for most things. One said on Caribbean St they didn鈥檛 haggle. My wife wanted a wrap and they didn鈥檛 haggle, I wanted cigars and Jewelry I paid 70% less than they asked, so they do haggle on certain items.I hope this helps I always read these reviews but always forget to post when I get backBut I did it this time because I know how important it was for me to read them.

<Content>wish we were still there!!! I am sitting in my study in Chicago looking out the window watching the snow fall and thinking about our recent trip to Iberostar Bavaro and wishing we were still there. We travelled from Feb 2nd to the 9th. We booked through Apple Vacations. I recommend Apple vacations. Everything was very smooth!! We flew on Pace Airlines, an apple charter airlines, the only problem I had was that there was no one to talk to at Pace airlines in regards to our flight. Just alot of recordings. Our flight was scheduled for 7AM and the night before at midnight there was still no information on our flight on the recorded number provided. Our tickets said to check in at the United ticket counter so I called United and they had never heard of Pace airlines. Our travel agent was closed so we went to the airport extra early. Once at the airport there were no problems at all. We actually checked in at the apple counter not United airlines and everything went extreemely smooth from that point on. I had emailed someone at the resort several weeks before our trip to request a room near the room and the pool and upon arriving at the resort the check in desk had a note from the person i emailed and put us in a very nice room between the pool and the beach. The other people who arrived with us all got put in rooms at the rear of the complex. Our room was awesome. It must have been recently remodeled. The air worked great and it DID NOT turn off when we left the room. The maid service was superb. Our room was cleaned thoroughly every day and the mini fridge was always stocked with beer and water. We did leave her a tip every day of $2.00 and whatever dominican currency we had received the day before. (The stores on the resort will only give you dominican change) We found the food got a bit old by the end of the trip. However that was fine with us as we werent going there for the cuisine. The variety was nice however a majority of the food was cooked in the same oil which lent to a similar bland taste. We did try the cajun the meditteraneun and the steak house. Of the three I would recommend the cajun restaurant. The buffet was nice for breakfast and dinner. Also I enjoyed the grilled food by the pool at lunch time. Cant go wrong with cheese fries or a grilled cheese dog! Most our days were spent the same way get up around 8:30 and head out to the beach. There was never a problem finding chairs at either the beach or the pool. We would relax on the beach until around lunch time. Then we would grab a bite at the pool side grill. After that it was back to the beach where we hung out at the ocean front bar on the beach. Ask Solomon to cook you up a sandwich and fries and ask Leonardo for a drink and you cant go wrong. After that we would take a long afternoon walk down the beach. You could walk forever. We literally walked two hours one way and there seemed to still be endless beach in front of you!!! Then it was time for a siesta before dinner. After dinner we generally had a drink or two at the lobby bar and then it was up to the room. We were asleep by 11 most nights. We did not do any of the excursions but we did go parasailing which was fun, $85.00 per couple. We also took out a sea kayak which was free for the first hour. Also dont miss a massage on the beach. $30.00 for 1/2 hour or $60.00 for an hour. The most impressive thing to me aside from the natural beauty of the area was the attitude of all the workers there. EVERYONE we met was nice and always greeted you with a kind smile. I speak no spanish but found that it was not a problem at all. Make sure to bring singles for tipping. We brought $100 and used them all. Anyone that went out of there way to make us happy we tipped. We gave three dollars to the water server at dinner one night in the meditteranean restaurant and her was so happy and thankful. He ran all the way out the door just to thank us. It means so much to them and they all try so hard to make your vacation so special! We also tipped the guys on the beach who arrange the chairs and pick up the area at night. The same thing he couldnt have been more appreciative for $3.00. What seems like a small amount to you or me means so much to them. If you have any more questions please feel free to email me. Relax you made a great choice!! Have a great trip

Many of the reviews I read I discount immediately, while others have valid points.I firmly believe it is the attitude of the traveler that will have a deciding factor in whether a vacation will be a disaster, or a success.That being said, My family and I had a wonderful time at the Iberostar Bavaro. This was our third stay at an Iberostar Resort (stayed at the Maya in Mexico in 2005 and Playa Del Mar in Mexico in 2003). We trust the Iberostar name and thought to try them on a different island. They did not dissapoint. The Bavaro is a much older property - more than ten years older than the Maya - but it is certainly not run down. The grounds are immaculate and beatiful - constantly updated by friendly workers. The rooms are clean and spacious - I did not notice any smell - brought candles and Fabreze. I did spray the Fabreze and I left my patio door open often for the lovely island breeze.I did bring singles and we did tip the bartenders and the maids. When we asked the maids to stock the fridge with water and beer - they did. There was no language barrier - You are in a Spanish speaking country - Don't expect to have a conversation about Shakepeare with your bartender. A little common sense please.The walkways can be slippery when it rains. The shows are great fun - try and stay up. Its not Vegas but its great.The casino was smokey with no waitress service - but a definite added bonus. We played black jack and some slots. The Star Rock Cafe was fun with the kids - we played FoosBall. Great way to spend some time in between dinner and the show.Food was good - not Great, but very good. The buffet's had tons of choices. Something for everyone. Fish is being grilled somewhere all the time. Hot dogs and pizza and chicken and burgers everyday for the less adventurous types. We tried the Gourmet, the Japanese and the Mediterannean. I thought all were good - but the Japanese disappointed me becuase it was not show cooking, and they cooked for the whole restaurant and when it was served to us, it was cold. I would have liked to try the Mexican and the Jambalaya...The bar could be upgraded, but it didn't bother me. Ask for Absolute if you want it. Johnny Red was the best scotch they had - only local beer, but it was cold and tasty.There are American TV channels - Cartoon Network When we asked Guest SErvices for extra sheets/towels - they were there within 1/2 an hourThe trip home is long. Lots of lines. No air conditioning. You need to expect that from most islands. We wore shorts and flipflops and changed on the plane - it made the wait much more tolerable. Pack sodas/water and snacks to have on you for the kids while you go from line to line.Don't listen to all the fuddy duddy's who said the resort was terrible. If you want a great steak, go to Del Frisco's in Manhattan. You go to the Carribbean for the sun, the beach and some great family time. Leave the New York attitude at home!

<Content>Amazing place!!!! All I can say is that the hotel was amazing, the food excellent, the beach gorgeous, great service and the grounds and rooms were wonderful. I had the best vacation at this place. We wouldn't hesitate to go back.Don't listen to these negative reviews from big complainers who obviously lack the mindset to comprehend that this is another country- NOT America.

<Content>A Perfect Vacation We just returned from a 1 week stay at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana on Feb. 5th and can't wait to return. The resort was beatuiful....very clean and well maintained. Our room was comfortable, clean and well stocked with towels, cold beer, water and soda daily. The staff was gracious and very accomodating. Many of them were multi lingual and if you asked them to speak English they did their best. The food was good, not great, but good and plentiful. We ate at 3 of the specialty restaurants, the pool grille and the buffet. Drinks were cold, refreshing and the variety was good. You could always find some sort activity in which to participate or just relax poolside or on the beach. We booked with Apple Vacations and were glad we did. All details such as transportation to and from the airport, excursions, advice on what to do, see, drink and eat were handled by an efficient Apple representative. The weather was slightly windy our first day, but turned perfect the rest of the week. Warm  sunny. The beach and pool areas were clean and chairs plentiful. We did not have to leave the resort as everything we needed was conveniently on the premises....casino, restaurants, bars, disco, entertainment, water sports, shops, spa, salon and more. I would highly recommend this property to anyone taking a vacation in the DR. Some tips: -Take plenty of small bills for purchases and tips. Tipping is not required but the service is so great you will want to tip the staff as you get to know them. They work such long hours and truly deserve it.-Treat the staff kindly and they will treat you kindly in return. They especially love when you call them by name. Franklin, Katty, Junior, Huck, Leonardo, Ernesto were some of our favorites.-See the concierge to book your specialty restaurant reservations as soon as you check in. We had no trouble getting our reservations for the restaurants we wanted.-Don't use the hotel phone, it's too expensive. Purchase a phone card from the Apple reps for $10 or check rates with your cellular carrier. I use Cingular and it cost $1.99 per minute to call USA and still cheaper than the hotel.-There is no alarm clock in the room, so if you need it take one along.-Haggle with the vendors on the beach to get good deals.-Schedule a massage and or other spa service.-If you asked for top shelf liquor, you get it.-It's worth the extra $$ to stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. All the rooms are suites and you are able to use of all of the amenities at the three Iberostar properties.-Have a great time, relax and enjoy! Iberostar Bavaro has something for EVERYONE.

<Content>Beautiful Bavaro Just back from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro-- (Jan. 21-28). It is truly an absolutely beautiful place; more lush than all the photos I've seen posted. The grounds are spotless--we never walked out our door without seeing someone sweeping, trimming, painting, etc. The staff was very friendly. Bartenders and wait staff speak several languages; maids and gardeners speak Spanish and little else. Is very good to learn a little Spanish before you go. Also helpful is a currency conversion chart, as all prices we saw were in pesos. The shops at the resort are very nice but pricey. The shops on Caribbean street did not haggle prices, but the shops in the Dominica lobby did. The straw market down the beach is the best place to buy trinkets and such. We bought several puzzle boxes there for $10-12; they were $40+ on Caribbean St.The food was great everywhere we ate. The buffet really does have lobster. The Mexican and Japanese restaraunts were my favorites. My husband loved the Mediterranean. We made our three guaranteed dinner reservations when we arrived on Sat. (took about 15 minutes), and went back the next day and made reservations for three more nights without any problem. The pool and beach are beautiful; there were always plenty of chairs available. Our ONLY complaint was that is is fairly windy on the beach. We did take coolie cups with lids (thanks to whoever posted that suggestion!) which they will refill at the bar. I still had sand in my drink sometimes because of the wind. The rooms were very nice. FYI--the air conditioning in the Bavaro rooms does not go off when you leave the room. The air conditioning control is a little hard to find--it was near a lamp on the headboard area of our bed.Our friends took an excursion to La Romano and Altos de Chavon and hated it. They spent 8 hrs. on a bus and were gone over 12 hrs; got back to the resort two hrs. later than they were told. Their lunch on a river barge was taken over by flies. We spoke with the concieirge about renting a scooter and were told it was not safe. He told us we could take a taxi into town safely but we chose not to. We felt very safe and secure at the resort; there were security guards at the beach and staff everywhere. We walked the beach in both directions in the daytime; it is mostly lined with resorts.This was our first all-inclusive together. I would definitely go back; I would also choose Iberostar again!

<Content>Great Place! Just returned from Iberostar Bavaro and was not disappointed. The grounds were beautiful, service was much better than you would receive in the US, food was too good (each of us put on 5-10lbs in a week) People were very friendly. Am already planning on returning. No one in our group got sick.

<Content>great place to go with a group I just returned from Iberostar resort with a group of 8 women. For an all inclusive I found it to be of high quality. The grounds are beautiful and the beach is spectacular. The room was recently renovated and very spacious with a seating area and a balcony.A few tips-the spa was clean and attractive. I had a hot stone massage with Rosie, definitly a must. They have 3 tennis courts, 2 are hartrue. Bring tennis shoes as they are very strict on requiring tennis shoes to play on the har true court.We signed up for one of the all day snorkeling tours through the dive shop on the property. snorkeling tours leave from an iberostar property on the caribbean side of the island. Guests are shuttled to that resort by bus. The dive shop told us it would be a one hour ride--it is a two hour ride each way. There is plenty of food and eating locations to choose from. The wine is undrinkable but the beer was tasty. Each night a different 'island drink is featured near the main bar. We loved the pina coladas served in fresh pineaples. The featured drink was fresh mixed in a blender. The pina coladas at the bars were from a slushy mix and not as good.All in all its a great place to go with a group.

<Content>Loved it except for language barier I just returned for the Dominican Republic last week and we stayed at the Bahia Principe resort. I found it to be amazing overall this place is huge. I thought the weather was great for this time of year considering I see snow more than sun in Buffalo New York. It only rain one afternoon out of my trip and by the time I was done shopping the sun came out and I was out in the sun working on my tan. The food was great and if you went hungry it was your own fault. Drinks we also amazing Dirty Monkeys, and the flaming coffee's just try one you will be hooked. Entertainment and night life was not as exciting and I had expactations of my own, but this place is more for familes and not couples or a young person who likes to go to clubs you will not find them here. I liked the piano bar just watching the people dance and staff get involved was entertaining all on its own. Shoping your at there mercy take a sweat shirt cause you won't find any here. Bring lots of singles with you it will help with bardering, stay away from the beach vendors they will rip you off and give you something else rather than what you paid for. Make sure you understand the currency so you know exactly how much they are looking for and take at least 50-60% off and make your offer on items you have interest in. Don't let them see that you have more money than what you are will to dish out. The airport will try to make you pay for overage so take only what you need and leave room for items you would like to bring home.You will need some dresser clothing if you plan on going to the resturants for dinner instead of the buffet. Men need nice dress pants and a nice shirt or you may not be able to attend because of their dress codes.I spent the majority of my time at the pool rather than at the beach because I am not that fond of sand. In order to get a good chair by the pool or at the beach don't forget to get your clean towel early which are avialable around 8:00am and place it on your chair of preferance around the same time, they fill up fast. I went on the Outback Safari and had a great time, got to experience the island alot more than staying at the resort the whole time, well worth the money if your not into water and prefer land. Coffee and Coco are a must buy to take home along with the Mamajuana. You will be sorry if you don't get any to take home. Take a cam corder I am sorry I left mine at home!!!!

<Content>AWESOME, In ONE word! Overall, This property was GREAT!!! I traveled with about 40 persons on an advertisers tour with a local television station. I took my 16 year old daughter as I felt this location was very safe for her, and it is.We arrived Jan 14 and left jan 21.By now you have read many reviews. All I can say is that some of the Europeans , as usual, were arrogant and indifferent to Americans. And I want to say my main concern was with the people with double strollers, for their obnoxious kids, who parked them in walkways and aisles in restaurants and anywhere else they saw fir. OK, OK , what is this for a complaint? That is my only stoopid problem.Everyone complained of the morons who bring their toddlers to these peoperties and expect everyone to fall in love with their little darlings and put up with their ignorant crap.. So much for them...Otherwise the place is great.It is not a place to pick up other singles, and that was ok, just for your info...I did feel sorry, as I realized we were in a third world country, for the ladies on the beach who could afford only 1/2 of their bathing suit. (Tee Hee)The aging gentleman wearing the yellow or black thong, with the potato stuffed in the front, was amusing to all.We did the Apple tour, AND EVERYONE, if you travel with Apple or not see PETRA at the Apple desk for all tour info and stuff, SHE IS AWESOME. If you swim with the sharks, remind her of the guy with missing fingers (not from the trip) who said to see her.Rafael (Tell him you saw his name here from Mr. BADA-BING) and Franklin at the Lobby bar are the best.Food is ok, I hated the Mediterrian but I am not into gourmet seafood and if you are, this is the place. I loved the steak house, Jambayla and the Mexican is fantastic.On the beach, you can get stuff for abouit 40% of what they ask, be a haggle-trader or you'll get screwed. See Jorge at Marco Polo shop for a good deal. We did the swim with sharks and sting rays, also the Outbacj Jungle tours. I recommend BOTH.Forget the Manatee Park, they are horrible.I will return, the best time for weather and price is May so check that out on Apple also.Natividad at the pool is a sweet waitress.The room was a little musty and we brought a candle also, and had a strange oder in the luggage too. So what?I spent about $800, but bought a lot of crap, spent $$$$ at the casino (RIGGED and watch the dealers) and took day trips, and tipped everyone a buck or two.If you want more info, e-mail me at bobclancy1948@yahoo.com.Big Bob, Davenport, IA, USA

<Content>Excellent...We loved it!!! Just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro stayed (1/14/-1/21). Some people have said that a week was too long but We have to disagree, My wife and I could have easily stayed for a month! Everything about the place was great from the food to the cleanliness, to the immaculate grounds, we can't wait to go back.We ate at 4 of the restaurants while we were there. The Mediterranean, The Steak place, The Japanese place and a new place called Jambalaya (cajun). My favorite was Jambalaya, tons of great seafood appetizers and the actual meals were even better! The Mediterranean place was a very close second. Steak place and Japanese were both great too, I'm just a really big seafood fan. The steaks were cooked to perfection and very good quality meat. The buffets were also great (so much good food so little time!)The service was the best; from the bell boys to the towel girl at the pool. Everyone always said hello and had a big smile on their face. The beach is beautiful, I went walking for an hour one day and could have kept walking for another few hours and still not seen an end to the beach.We did stop by the stores set up on the beach. They did have some cool stuff and if you work it right you can get a pretty good deal on some native Dominican stuff.I can't say enough good things about the Iberostar Bavaro, my wife and I will definitely be going back. Email me if you have any questions.

<Content>Wonderful Just got home from the Iberostar Bravo. LOVED IT!!!I had to admit that I did have my doubts, but they are all gone and I can't wait to go back. The service was excellent, the place was clean, food was delicious, and I couldn't say enough about it.

<Content>Great hotel for the money Iberostar, Bavaro, Dominican RepublicTraveled from 1/15/06 to 1/19/06. Can't say enough about cleanliness at the hotel. Everyone was very friendly. Was worried about safety, which was no problem whatsoever. I have been to many islands, and this was very enjoyable. I do prefer the calm beach of the caribbean such as Barbadoes, but you get alot for your money at Iberostar.No smell in the room, no bugs. Would prefer an oceanview room which I don't think exists, maybe one or two, but it would be impossible to book, all rooms are the same price. The rooms and bathrooms are huge.I found the food to be quite good, the buffets do look the same after a while, but that's okay. Steak House was very good and so was the Mediterranean. We only had three days on the beach and they were great, but very windy, but the sand does not blow, andyou could stay out all day without getting hot. I would definitly suggest this hotel to anyone looking for a great vacation for the money. Hotel ride from airport is exactly 35 minutes on a nice bus or van. Apple vacation was the best with a rep at the hotel all the time to help, they have $10 calling cards which gives you 16 minutes of talking, or internet was only $5 for 30 minutes. Airport was a little crowded going in, don't forget to buy tourist card when you arrive for $10, you need to show it when you leave. Leaving the airport was nicer,food available and very comfortable.A great vacation for the money, remember that. Only had a tummyache from eating too much and drinking too many different drinks.

<Content>wonderful resort Well I was suprised to read the previous persons review. My husband and I arrived on January 16th for 4 nights. I am a travel agent and have been to many islands including the Iberostar in Rivera Maya. I loved the Iberostar Bavero in Punta cana. We did not get sick at all.... We did brush our teeth with bottled water and only drank bottled water at the resort. However if you are going to eat your eggs raw like some of the people then maybe you will get sick as you would in the USA. We ate at the Steak House, Japaness, and the Cajan and all were excellent if you don't like gourmet food and you are a person that only eats boring bland meat and potatoes and dont enjoy calamari and sushi then you need to find a Crackel Barrell resturant in Wisconcin this is not for you. They had wonderful seafood, steak, Duck ect. The rooms were beautiful. The landscape is breath taking I wish I was there again now. One thing I will say the alcohol was not up to par as the other people stated. Wine and frozen drinks not the best. Beer and mixed drinks good. The wine in the resturants better. Drink at the lobby bar... Enjoy lisa

<Content>iberostar bavaro A wonderful family vacation Jan. 13 to Jan.20. The most beautiful grounds I've ever seen. Groomed daily. Rooms were great for me, one of the rooms did have a musty smell but was corrected by a dehumidifer supplied by the hotel. Housekeepers were great and early. I don't understand the bad reviews I've read. Anyone who could't find food they liked are crazy. So many choices, they obviously did look at all the options. One recent negative review was from a mother who wasn't happy with anything except the fact that her child could dance on stage. My only complaint was the children. While we were attempting to enjoy the nightly entertainment small children were running across the stage and their mothers seemed to think it was cute. That is not the hotels fault it is the fault of irresponsible parents. What are they thinking? I will return to enjoy the beauty of the hotel again. One more thing the sand is like powered cool sugar. I've never seen anything remotely close to it.

<Content>A great vacation at Iberostar Bavaro! There were 9 adults in our 40's and early 50's and we all loved our trip. Key items to know:1- The food is very good. I'm a gourmet cook and I sure was pleased. If you don't like seafood you may not be thrilled, but I do, and I was!2- Take $100 in one dollar bills- for sure! Also take some $5's and $10's. They don't give you change in US money so be smart. 3- Leave your cleaning lady a tip each day. 4- The fitness facility was HORRIBLE! Not enough equipment, the step class was a joke, the water aerobics was done by people who have NO CLUE. 5- Palace Resorts, Adventura it was not, but this place is beautiful, clean, food very good, ask for top shelf liquor and you get it. The rooms are clean - but no coffee makers! Nor will they deliver breakfast to your room. That was a first and we missed having someone knock on our door to wake us with coffee and fresh fruit. No alarm clocks either.6- Swim up bar and Lely was so much fun. Our group of 9 spent many late afternoons sipping, singing, and just having a grand time. Lely was our favorite employee of the entire resort. 7- Not knowing Spanish does hurt, but you'll do just fine. The front desk is not organized and at check out it was frustrating - so go early. 8- We went Gogo. Next time I'd go Apple. Gogo didn't give us enough info. (but cheaper - get what you pay for I guess). 9- Frankly, I think the buffet had better food then the specialty restaurants. They were good, but there were some great food on the buffet each night. Most all inclusives give you great breakfasts and lunches and the dinner is very average. This was really the opposite - the breakfast was average at best, lunch pretty darn good, and the dinners very good. 10- The pancakes that look to be whole wheat we found out on our final day were - chocolate pancakes. So much for eating healthy all week. 11- The beach was the most beautiful we've ever been to (and we've been to many) and the waters more crystal blue then we've ever seen. 12- Excursions - we didn't even finish our books let alone get to excursions. It was the first time we traveled with friends and realized how much fun you have drinking and talking with friends. Normally we keep ourselves extremely busy on excursions so this was a different experience for us.13- We were there mid Jan 06 so hardly any kids, which we liked. Seemed pretty boring for kids. Almost too sleepy for us.14- The shows. Oh the shows were horrible. Anyone who likes the shows has to be very drunk. The disco was pretty nice though. The sports bar carried football for us.15- We had a room on the second floor - we had good AC and I didn't think our room was musty, but when I got home and opened our bag I was like WOW! That candle idea is probably pretty good idea to help with potential smell. 16- We all came home with jewlery of the Island. My husband bought a lot of cigars from the huts on the beach. We bought our cheap jewlery at the hotel and we bought our expensive jewlery at Harrisons at the hotel. The huts didn't keep their jewlery cleaned. 17- Some of the men in thongs were funnier than the shows at night. Take the digital camera for laughs back at home! 18- Arrival into the airport was easy. Leaving not so bad either. What airport isn't packed anymore? It takes you 2 hours here in the US. Why shouldn't it take you at least 2 hours in a third world country? 19- Enough shade everywhere for those who don't like sun. 20- None of us got sick. We over drank and ate and felt bad a few days, but not from the food. Just be smart about what you eat. My husband gets sick all the time and he didn't get sick. 21- Don't sign anything - read it. They take all your rights away. We never signed it. Check what you are signing at check out as well. I doubt you could ever sue them, but why give up your rights from the get go? 22- Get reservations the minute you arrive for the specialty restaurants. Everyone has different tastes, but we all liked the steak place. The other 2 we ate at was good for some, not for others. The buffet is the best!!!!! and you can wear shorts!23- For a late check out they charged us $45. DO IT! They have these rooms you can shower in but you have to wait turns and the line was really long. I'm SO glad all 9 of us pitched it and kept one room. This was one of the smartest things we could have done. 24- The casino wasn't so bad. Sure it was small. My hubby entertained himself at night and only came home $50 in the hole. Cheap for a week's entertainment. If you want: GORGEOUS beaches, a reasonable vacation, good food, a clean and pretty resort - I can't imagine you'll be disappointed.

<Content>wonderful!! My wife and I went with another couple for a week ending Jan. 21, 2006. I was one of the nicest trips we've ever had.The pool is huge and clean and there's a deep section where no kids play. However there's a large shallow area and a separate baby's pool. The beach is huge and clean with plenty of lounge chairs and shaded areas. It was very windy at the beach for 5 out of 7 days so a little disappointing but the weather was sunny and warm generally. The staff were fantastic...friendly, kind, helpful, cheerful.All the rooms are junior suites in two storey four- plexes so you have lots of space, always perfectly clean every day with flowers placed all over.The grounds are kept clean and well-groomed at all times.We went to the Japanese and French restaurants and we were happy with both...very good food. The buffet has a lot of variety and very good, especially the poolside eating area. Get a room close to the pool if possible because it's a huge resort.We would all definitely go again.

<Content>Just OKAY, nothing special...... Well I will say that I was nervous about going to this hotel after reading the reviews but we did go w/ an open mind. On a positive note, the surrounds are beautiful, the beach was very relaxing and just gorgeous, it was always clean and the water was ice blue. We did go out faily early in the morning to take our place on the beach since I was traveling w/ small children I wanted the option of shade. The employees were very pleasant and always said, hello. They also went out of their way to say hello to my children. My children (19 months and 3 years old) LOVED the shows at night, they got on stage and danced to the music.Now onto the not so good things, we did request a room w/ an adjoining door so that my inlaws could help w/ the children. There was 15 of us traveling together. The front desk claimed that there were no such rooms. After going back and forth we had asked to speak w/ a manager and somehow when the manager appeared there were several room that were available w/ adjoining doors. When we got to our room I didn't notice the smell that some people have mentioned but several people we were with did claim that there room did have an odor to it. The room was okay, nothing special, infact the shower head was falling off the wall, after calling the front desk and asking they fix it, we got fed up w/ waiting and my husband fixed it instead, by the way, no one ever did ask us about it again. I also had a request for a crib, I wasn't expecting a new crib by any means but this crib had certain been through a lot of children. If you are bring a toddler that needs a cib take my advice and bring extra crib sheets (which I did) to wrap around the mattress. If you are there for more than a few days you are going to get sick of the food. I was only there from a Friday till a Tuesday and couldn't wait to eat American food again. There is always french fries and pizza and you can get that anytime. You do have to be careful what we eat due to the things that are washed in water. Although they say the hotel's water is purified you still need to be careful, there is still some traces of bacteria in the water. That is why they give you a ton of water in your room. Infact, they only recommend you just brush your teeth, not swallow the water. This information is from a brochure we got in the lobby of the hotel. Out of 15 of us 7 of us were ill w/ vomiting and diarrhea. My 2 little ones got very sick but I'm really not sure if it was from there or a virus, either way it was bad news. We did eat at a few of the specialty restaurants (The Steak Place, the Japanese, and the Louisiana). I can't say anything special about them, the steaks were horrible, especially if you have ever been to a decent steak place back at home. I don't recommend eating the hamburgers or hot dogs for that matter, I didn't even let my children eat it. I ordered room service one night (a pizza) they told me 20 minutes and 2 hours later I had to call back. That was the same night I turned on my light to check on the daughter and a roach ran across the bed. On a final note the alcohol was HORRIBLE and nothing close to being drinkable. Yes, there was champagne but it was very cheap and you wouldn't want to drink more of a glass of it to begin with. There speciality drinks were frozen until you added alcohol to them and they it turned to almost water.The bottom line is we will not be going back. I have been to several islands and although like I mentioned the surrounds are beautiful at Punta Cana, it doesn't compare to the other places we have traveled.

<Content>Would highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro Travelled the week of December 18-25, 2005 with my late teens son and loved the hotel facilities and staff at the Iberostar Bavaro. Our room was clean and inviting, with comfortable beds, a great sitting area and a large balcony with green parrots and other birds in the tree tops and flamingos and ducks at our door. Our bath was great with a glass and marble shower as well as bathtub, lots of counter space and amenities. The closet and storage area were large with a greater than average number of hangers and iron and ironing board. The minibar seemed to always be full. The only missing element was an inroom coffee maker but I understand that they are coming.The choice and quality of food in the buffet restaurants were great. The main buffet restaurant is surrounded by water features - sit at tables on the edge and be visited by ducks and flamingos. In the mornings, freshly squeezed orange juice and great coffee. The buffet is set up in stations, from fresh fruit and smoothies to omlettes - you name it. The beach buffet restaurant also had hot breakfasts while we were there - great for beach lovers who want to set up there beach loungers and have a late breakfast. We had lunch at the beach buffet. In addition to pizza, pasta, salads, there was a barbeque station that had steak, chicken, porkshops, hamburgers. At a separate station, each day there was a different theme with chefs and staff serving food (juicy lobster tails) and drink specialties. Another station for gelato type ice cream or self serve soft ice cream. Dinners in the main buffet again had incredible choices and theme nights that included mounds of lobster and shrimp. Went to the Japanese and Mediterranean restaurants which were good, made even better by enthusiatic staff. The beach buffet converts to a steakhouse a la carte at night - the steak was more tender than most of what I have had in Canada. The bars on the beach and at the pool area were friendly - cocolocos and bananamamas are musts to try. The main bar area is beautiful in the evenings with water features, lots of tables, servers and great drink choices, including cold champagne. Every evening a specialty drink was served, from tropical drinks in coconuts to flamed rum and brandy coffees. The entertainment at night was an adventure, some good, some bad but all with enthusiasm. On Christmas Eve, there was a special dinner event. Guests and staff dressed in their finest. Champagne flowed freely with a huge display of hot and cold horsdoerves. Santa had flown in earlier by helicopter, landing on the beach to the awe of children and many adults. There were loads of teens and young adults and my son had no problem finding a willing crowd of friends at the disco or sports bar at night. There seemed to be a bar open and food available at almost any time. Room service was available 24 hours and was not bad although we only used it once. But now the beach. The sand was like silk and was cleaned every day. Noone approaches you other than Starfriends to stop by to say hi. We had perfect weather for the whole week with a light breeze from the ocean. Lounge chairs were always available, with shade available from the thatched palapas or from the trees. While there were loads of activities on the beach and in the pool area, my days were spent on the beach with books (there is a library in the towel hut)or walking for kilometers either way. Never a problem with towels - when you turn in your towel you have the choice or taking back a towel card or a fresh towel that you can take back to your room for the morning. The staff at the hotel were lovely - one could not pass by without being greeted with a smile and an ola whether it be at the front desk, in the gardens, at the restaurants or on the beaches. Staff work long hours. No sign of tip jars and certainly no expectation expressed but take lots of small bills - you will want to show your appreciation for the beautiful Dominican smiles and genuine interest in you.

<Content>Loved the Iberostar Bravaro My husband and I planned this trip as a last family get together as both our sons just graduated from college in the last year. We never expected the resort to be as great as it was. The food and drinks were plentiful and the weather and surroundings are just to beautiful to describe. the people there are always too happy to accomadate you. If you don't have a good time it is your own fault. We would recommend this resort to any one and would defintely return ourselves. Great time had by all

<Content>Awesome vacation, will definetely return We just returned from New Year's week, Dec 28th to Jan 4th, at the Iberostar Bavaro and would highly recommend this resort and island to others. WE have travelled to many all inclusive resorts in the Caribbean/Mexico (including 3 Sandals resorts 2 in Jamaica and one in St Lucia) and would have to put this one at the top of our list. We have also travelled extensively throughout the world, including Western Europe, Asia, Israel, etc to give the readers some perspective.We chose this resort after reading the many good reviews (they appeared to have more positive reviews than other resorts we researched) and would have to say that most of the positive comments were very accurate. The negative reviews,on the other hand, I believe were not all well supported.Here is what we found:Rooms- were clean, spacious and comfortable. Yes, the pillows may have been thin, but I did not feel they were any worse than other places we have stayed. The showers did leak onto the floor, but I think that was becuase the shower curtain had to be secured and if the water pressure was lowered it would reduce the leakage. The towels were fine, not thick, but were effective.The TV's had numerous English stations. I am not sure where that one reviewer stayed, but we had plenty of English channels (CNN, ESPN, TNT, TBS, Encore, ABC(in NY), WGN (Chicago), VH1 and maybe 2 others). This was much more than our last stay in Punta Cana which was about 6 years ago when we got 2 stations.I did not notice any mildew smell nor any bugs. The last night I did notice (although my boyfriend said he was always there) a tiny lizard on the wall, but he did not bother us. (My boyfriend said he was more afraid of us than I was of him.) Regardless, when I stayed in Florida there was always more than 1 that got into the house.Air conditioning worked fine. Yes, it does turn off when the sliding door was opened, but immediately turned back on once it was closed, so there was no significant break in service if you were just quickly opening the door.The safes in the rooms did not cost a thing as one reviewer claimed.Food-I thought the food was very good. There was plenty of choices at the buffets. Although every meal was very good, I liked the breakfast the least, only becuase I enjoy scrambled eggs and oatmeal and found both to be very runny. Nevertheless, overall I enjoyed the food and was not that concerned with the quality or cleanliness. I believe it was comparable, if not better, than the other open air buffets at other Caribbean resorts.The water in the restaurants is ok to drink. It is filtered/purified and comes from the soda fountains/dispensers that are located at the buffets, which is nice because you can serve yourself instead of waiting for service like we did at the Sandals resorts.I do agree with the comment of one reviewer that the specialty restaurants were intentionally not filled to capacity so that more people would use the buffet. We made reservations at the specialty restaurants, the next evening after our arrival. The only reservation we could get early on in our stay was the Mexican (at the Punta Cana/Dominican resort) at 9:30 on Friday. However, we went to the restaurant at 7:30 to see if we could get in sooner, which we did; they allowed us to come at 8 pm and the restaurant was never at full capacity, even after we finished our meal. So it appears as long as you have a reservation at a specialty restaurant, you can ask to be seated earlier than your scheduled reservation, since none of the restaurants are at full capacity.We were able to get 2 other reservations during our stay (last 2 nights) (FYI: you are guaranteed 3 reservations for a 7 night stay). The Gourmet was very nice, however beware, the steaks were undercooked because they were so thick!!!!(i think they were still breathing). This was no problem, we simply sent them back. Suggestion: I would ask for well done to get medium well and medium well to get medium. Once they were returned, they were delicious. I was not expecting a filet of that quality. The steak house was average, the steak there was slightly overcooked when asking for medium well. (I guess it was a different cook).Beach/Pool-The beach was beautiful: nice white sand, clear blue water, uninterrupted stretch for walking. The pool was nice if you like opportunties for releif from the sun, since there were alot of trees that blocked the sun at certain times of the day. Few areas recieved sun the majority of the day. WE found the beach to be nicer becuase of the breeze and opportunites for sun and/or shade from the umbrellas.Airport/Transportation to/from resort -Everything was fine when you arrive. Remember to get your tourist card before you go through customs. They will ask for it. It costs $10.00 a person. When departing, the lines were awful. Now we know why you need to get there 3 hours before your flight leaves. I hope they add more agents at USAIR in the future. (It looked like Delta was just as bad).The ride to and from the resort was fine, only 35 minutes. The ride may be bumpy at times, some sections more than others, but I did not find it so awful as others have stated. I also did not find it significantly worse than other places we have visited.All in all, I would have to say that we enjoyed our stay and will definetely consider coming back.

<Content>Great vacation, but wished for a few extras. Just returned from 7 nights at the Iberostar Bavaro, from 12/26 - 1/2. We were two families traveling with 6 teenage boys, ages 15 - 21. We have travelled the Caribbean extensively, but never visted the Dominican Republic before and have had only one other experience at an all inclusive. I thought the resort as a whole was very beautiful, tropical and well cared for. Gardens were pretty and the beach was very nice. Flamingos and peacocks were a nice touch. People that worked at the resort for the most part, were very happy, friendly and accomodating. I was surprised at the amount that only spoke Spanish, so a few times there was a communication barrier. Initially we were given rooms near a busy, noisy service area, and when requesting a change, it was a very slow, long process that they made us wait in the lobby (over an hour), but in the end it was worth it. We didn't know about the  call 24 hours before you arrive rule to put in your room request. We wanted all four rooms together and ground floor, but we were separated. Rooms were nice,clean and spacious but certainly not plush. Some minor irritants included small, thin towels, worn flat pillows and a shower curtain that at one time may have been water proof, but allowed the water to seep through and flood the bathroom floor every shower. Happened in other rooms also. Lighting was poor, and the air conditioning shutting off every time you opened the sliding door was annoying. A suggestion would be to have it shut off after a set time, say 15 minutes. Anyway, not major annoyancees, but just letting you know what to expect. Also, the free, stocked mini bar would have been nicer if it had some sort of wine or champagne for those who don't drink beer, and maybe even a few crackers or chips.The resort had plenty of activities listed, but any that we were interested in (archery, ping pong, shooting) usually had long lines, and once when we showed up a minute late, they said it was too full and we couldn't participate. In archery for instance, they had one target and you had to wait in line with about 20 other people. It would have been so easy to add another target and keep people moving. Also if your kids are in the tween years, not old enough for the adult wrist band given at 18, but too old for the mini disco and kids activities, there wasn't much to do for them. They aren't allowed in the disco, gym and some other areas. Even with a parent. We noticed that many young looking kids had adult wristbands, so some parents must ask for them and successfully get them.For you wine lovers and beer lovers, the selection is limited. One type of beer and no selection on the wine, except in the restaurants with reservations where they only have one type of red and white, but the quality seems alittle better. I figure if they can have all sorts of hard alcohol choices, it shouldn't be too hard to have a couple of beer choices and a half decent chardonnay or merlot. The beach bar doesn't even serve wine which was a pain for happy hour on the beach. You had to walk all the way to the pool area to get some wine. French fries and grilled ham and cheese were great at the beach bar though, and it was a beautiful setting to enjoy a drink.Food was always plentiful, but not of the highest quality or taste.The breakfast buffet had everything you could want (except bagels and smoked salmon), and some things you surely didn't (lunch meats, salads,mashed potatoes, baked beans etc. Great homemade croissants and doughnuts! Lunches always had grilled items and one special (pasta bar, paella, chinese). The kids didn't care for the food much and we heard some complaints now and then. It looks like a plethora of choices when you first approach the buffet, but alot of the stuff is very salty, and over or under cooked, and sitting there along time. I actually saw one guy touch a bunch of sandwiches before choosing one, checking to see which roll was the freshest. Most people had manners and used the tongs, but it's something you always have to be careful of with buffets. I stayed away from that area after that. We did enjoy the restaurants with reservations, but think that the resort limits the amount of people that can go there to encourage you to go to the buffet. Every restaurant that we went to, and we went four times at different hours, was never more then half full. It stands to reason when they are putting out these huge buffets, that it is more cost effective for the resort to have you eat there, as opposed to ordering off menus. The restaurant food was Ok, good but not great. I know where we live, we are fortunate to have some great restauratns and chefs, so maybe I'm alittle spoiled. The steakhouse was awful and even the kids complained that their steaks were so undercooked, Medium rare must have a different meaning there. My salmon was dry and way overcooked. The Japanese restaurant had good shushi, but the chicken and shrimp teppanyaki was very salty and alittle overcooked. The gourmet restaurant was the nicest, but they won't seat 10 as a group, and broke us up into two tables of 4 and one of 2. The food was good and the service was great. Wouldn't go there with small children as the setting is very quiet.All in all, we would return here as the older boys loved the nightlife, disco, room service, banana boats and pool. We liked the beach, bars, beautiful grounds, entertainment and taking long walks. Oh, if you are accomplished scuba divers or snorkelers as we are, you will be dissappointed in the dead reef and lack of fish. If you have ever been to Grand Cayman or any of the other top diving spots, there is no comparision, but we didn't expect too much going into this regarding diving. It's available, but not the greatest.

<Content>Excellent and Huge! We just finished spending a week at the Iberostar Bavaro- had a great time on the beach just relaxing, reading, sitting- and drinking :) I read a lot of reviews before we left, and I'm not going to repeat that info- so go back and read the reviews from September onward. Things the other reviews didn't say: 1)When you check in and get your bracelet that ID's you as belonging to the resort- have them put it on the wrist you don't use much! It can scrape you when you are putting on the suntan lotion or bathing- and is in general annoying- but required!2) Leave your attitude at home- there is absolutely no reason to give the resort employees a hard time because you a) lost your towel b) forgot to bring your towel or towel card to the pool area (and it's a long way back the room!) c)had to wait a few extra minutes for something you want- like a special drink etc. I tipped the towel girl 2$ the last morning because I had seen her dealing very nicely with several people who brought their attitude (but not the towel card)to the towel hut.3) I reiterate a little- take insulated mugs with you- and take them on the outings. The ocean has many little plastic dixie cups in it from blowing off the boats (you don't see them, but still!) Save the environment a little!4) Skip the lobster formal dinner- La Bellina I think is the name- there is no food choice in this restaurant. The food and ambiance is better elsewhere, and there are choices.5) The room was great and well cared for- we tipped daily since the room girls switch periodically.6) The food was fantastic! Pate, cheeses, desserts- all of it was good (and I ate far too much!) I had no upset stomachs that were caused by bad food (1 stomach upset from eating way too much).7) The local residents don't drink the tap water- so neither should you. That was no problem- the minibar was always filled with drinks, and all the ice and water from the bars and restaurants was filtered/purified. We brushed our teeth with bottled water and kept the bottles next to the faucet to remind us. The room cleaner picked up on that and left us extra bottles of water by the sink.8) The Iberostar resort complex isn't really 3 resorts- It's one huge one. So bring your walking shoes! There are about 1100 rooms- It's too big for my taste, so next year we are thinking about going to a smaller Iberostar resort(since the food was excellent) and the rooms were well done. 9) Overall- if people would leave their attitudes and moody teens behind- this was the best vacation yet!

<Content>Iberostar gets 5 stars! My family and I just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana, and boy did we have a great vacation! Here's MY full review on the trip...The Airport::My first question for Apple: WHY would they make a flight @ 5:00 a.m.? We had to wake up before 3 in the morning to make it to the airport in time. The line were terrible @ O'Hare, but the plane was better because we could all get some sleep. Once you get to Punta Cana, the first thing you do is take a picture with a bunch of Dominican women. This is impossible to avoid, because it's the first line you stand in once you get off the plane. You can purchase the pictures for $8 when you head home (they are displayed in the airport in flight categories). Then you have to buy the tourist card, fill out the blue slips, get your luggage, etc. On the way home the lines are much longer, and if traveling with kids, I suggest making sure they have something to do while waiting in the lines at the terminal.The rooms::All in all the rooms were pretty good. We had stayed at the Iberostar in Mexico a year earlier, and these rooms were much bigger. The beds are small, but the kids can sleep on the 2 couches which leaves husband and wife each a double bed. We WERE hoping for more drawer space, though:1 is definately not enough! Also, hooks in the bathroom would have been nice (there were none whatsoever). Also, it might be helpful to ask the maid service to bring a gallon of water (the tap water is not suitable for drinking), instead of having to open 2 or 3 bottles each night. The majority of the TV channels were in Spanish, but we had fun watching sumo wrestling, The World's Strongest Man, and The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. The Food::...was outstanding! We went to the buffet by the pool each morning, and there was always a variety of things to have. Our favorites at the buffet included the eggs, french fries, grilled chicken, nachos, and of course, the ice cream. We also had reservations at 3 of the restaurants which were all good (Japanese was our favorite..the beef was muy fantastica!) And when you don't have reservations, the main buffet in the lobby is always open, with SO much to choose from. The Service::While a lot of the workers did not speak English (mainly the ones you would not have to converse with), the ones who did were a riot! Everyone was so friendly, saying hola and buenos dias whenever you pass by. They love to dance and sing, too, and double as the performers in the shows (more on those later). The room service was a bit slow, but all in all, the service was phenomonal.The Pool/Beach::Both were wonderful! Make sure to get there early and claim seats, especially if you're in a large group (if you put something on the seats, you can have them for the whole day!) The pool was a lot of fun, and buying the $4 rafts in the hotel gift shop made it even more fun for the whole family. The beach was the same amount of fun, and it also was great for snorkeling--just put on a mask, swim a little off the shore, and the reefs make for awesome snorkeling.The Diving::Yes, I am a certified scuba diver, and yes, I did dive in Punta Cana. The people at the dive center are very friendly, and you just go and sign up for the dives you want. If you're not certified, you can take free classes in the pool or a class to get a sort of mini certification so that you can go on 1 or 2 dives, too. They don't have a ton of equiptment, especially for the younger divers. The small boats are VERY bumpy, and not for those who tend to get sea sick, so try and get into a bigger group. The actual diving is OK, nothing fantastic. Now the wreck diving, that's what's cool. We went to Monica's Wreck, and it was well worth the 25-30 minute boat ride. Nighttime::Nights were fun. After dinner, whether you're at a restaurant or the buffet, there are always things to do in the lobby aferwards. For instance, one night there was a sort of sidewalk sale, which was fun to shop around in, and there are always specialty drinks being stirred next to the bar. Now, the shows...they are at 10:00 each night. While most of them are OK for kids, not all of them were rated PG. Being on vacation, 10 may be a little early for you to turn in for the night, so what we did was bring a deck of cards, and play at one of the tables while the show was going on so that we could at least listen to the music and singing, and watch, if it was one that was OK for the kids. Now, a few special things you want to do::1. Parasailing. You can haggle a little for the price, but believe me, it's worth every penny. And there's no age limit...anyone can do it! 2. Haggle with the Locals. We loved to walk down the beach to the shacks, where you're greeted by the locals with for you, almost free, cheapy, cheapy, and special deal today, only for you. They make really nice jewelry, and the paintings are cool, too.3. Feed the peacocks. They wander around during the day, especially by the buffet. Throw them some bread, or, if you're daring, get close are hold the bread out for them. A few will get close enough to grab it out of your hand! 4. Go to the swim-up bar. Nothing is more relaxing than a Banana Mama in the pool.Anyways, that should be it. Hope you found this review helpful, and hope you have a great vacation!

<Content>Wonderful! My full detailed report First and foremost, NO our room did not smell!! In fact, we brought scented candles and didn't even use them. Second, my wife and I did NOT get sick at all, not even once. Third, we had NO bugs in our room. Fourth, if you booked the Bavaro - you made the correct choice! We talked with dozens of people on our charter flight and based on their descriptions, the Bavaro was #1. On to the review...What was the airport like? (Okay, I'm not complaining here, I'm just posting this as a guide. When we were at the airport all I could think was I wish I knew how this worked...well, now you do!)First, when you get there, you have to get your picture taken with some Dominican women (tourist stuff) there is no way to avoid this...they line you up and you wait. After that, head directly to the center of the large room and buy your $10 tourist card (hang on to that card, you'll need it when you go home) and get your blue customs form. Fill out the form and get in line for customs. After that you get your bags. Don't be fooled by those hustlers in the white shirts, they'll offer to take your bags, but you only have to walk like 40 yards to the bus. And they'll mess with you by yelling APPLE (or other companies). The Apple rep is just beyond them and they'll tell you what # bus to get on for the resort. Once on the bus you're all good. The whole process takes about 45 mins, plus a 45 minute drive. The ride is interesting...you see a lot of what real Punta Cana is like.On the way home, wear shorts. No matter how tempted you are to wear pants, forget it because the process to leave is a mess. First, you get off the bus at the airport and again it's like a bull-pen. They line you up along with every other flight out that day and you wait for your bags to get searched, and then you check in with the airline. When you check in, remember to grab another blue customs slip. You then get in another line for customs. After that, you wait in another line for your carry-ons to be scanned. Then finally you will be in the terminal area. Two things, A) This process took over 2 hours B) It was HOT! My wife had on jeans and she was dying. Oh, and by the way, those white shirt guys will automatically take your bags from the bus, you basically have no choice and since they have no idea what airline you're taking, they just drop your stuff anywhere...we learned this the hard way. I guess you'll have to see the madness for yourself - but just trust me on the shorts. Again, not complaining, I understand the economy there, this was just a guide.Now the resort - which was awesome btw.How was the food?Iberostar's food was top-notch. We made 4 reservations and had the buffet 3 nights. On Sunday night the buffet had grilled lobster and I'm not talking about he little kind you get at Red Lobster...these guys were fat, and of course, all you can eat. For our reservations, we had Japanese, Mediterranean, Steakhouse, and Tropical. Japanese was awesome. They had all kinds of fresh sushi, it ruled. We ordered hibachi-style shrimp and chicken. Mediterranean was basically all seafood, I got muscles and my wife got sea bass, and it was delicious. Steakhouse was awesome. One funny thing is they were playing country music! You hear Spanish music all week then you get some Alan Jackson in the steakhouse, we were dying! We both got the rib eye - juicy and tender. This was my wife鈥檚 favorite, my fav was the Tropical restaurant. The Tropical is as close to Dominican food as you get. My wife had another rib eye with mango/pineapple chutney, and I had lobster pasta, again, with massive chunks of grilled lobster. In all, I think there's like 2 or 3 other restaurants to pick from too. Because you鈥檙e at the Bavaro you have run of the properties and can eat at their restaurants and buffets. There is a beach buffet next to the pool/beach which features A LOT of options. I don鈥檛 understand how anyone could grow tired of this buffet. There is also a different grilled option each day鈥rom shish kabob to steak to ribs. One more thing鈥here is this little hut/bar down the beach towards the shops, they have grilled hot/ham cheese, hot dogs and fresh fries. It may sound silly to eat those things when you have such nice other options but we actually found this place as the perfect mid-morning snack. The main buffet has so much food your head will spin. I just kept eating and eating and eating. Room service? Haha, we got it just for the heck of it! It was good.How are the grounds?Plain and simple鈥orgeous. The staff is constantly grooming them. Guys climbing palm trees, guys sweeping, guys picking up any seaweed, I could go on. There are flamingos, ducks, and peacocks walking around. The beach is awesome. We walked all the way down the beach to see the other resorts and their beach areas didn鈥檛 compare at all. They lacked palapas (sp?), amenities and just didn鈥檛 look as nice. Also on the Marinarium tour we cruised past another handful of resorts that didn鈥檛 look as nice as well. The beach sand is like powder, water warm and clear...God I miss it. The staff?Anyone that thinks this staff is rude needs to get their head checked. They are so friendly, everyone says 鈥榟ola鈥?to you as you walk around. Seriously, I had developed a relationship with the omelet-making guy at the buffet and by Saturday, we were amigos. He said to me on my last day, 鈥淎migo, you are my friend, and I love you.鈥?This was genuine 鈥?no tips, just a nice person. Again, this staff is fantastic. And if they鈥檙e not working, they are singing and dancing.What tours did you take?The Marinarium snorkel tour. Very fun, and it was really slick swimming with sharks and stingrays. These sharks are nurse sharks so they don鈥檛 bite, but they鈥檙e still like 6-7 ft long! You eat sandwiches, drink rum, and dance on the boat. They stop at a sandbar where you drink some more too.  The Outback Safari Tour. Okay, I seriously think anyone going to Punta Cana should take this tour. It gets you off the resort and into the towns and countryside. Our guide, Omar, filled us in on everything we ever wanted to know about Dominican Republic. They take you a school (the kids are so cute), to a house, a rum shack, a coffee/cocoa plantation, boogey boarding, a ranch to eat lunch and you drink rum the whole way! When we started the tour we thought it would be just 鈥渃ool鈥?but by the end of the day we really get a good understanding of the Dominican people and their way of life. You can bring books and stuff for the kids (the tour will take them). Again, the really interesting part about this tour was just sitting in the open-aired bus talking to Omar about his life and the life of the Dominican people. (side note: Our tour consumed 6 bottles of rum that day. There were people from MI, AL, MO, and WI 鈥?the previous record for Omar was 5.5 bottles. Do you have to drink? Absolutely not. But we made some friends and it was a ton of fun 鈥?Shout out to Billy from St. Louis!) Please take this tour, you will not regret it.That is all. Email me (my address is at the top) and I'll send you the link to our photos. For anyone heading to Iberostar Bavaro you can rest easily tonight because you made the right decision.

<Content>We couldn't have loved it more My husband an I went to the Iberostar Barvaro Nov. 14-21. We couldn't have had a better time. Also, I can't imagine that we could have picked a better place.First off, the resort was immaculate. It was incredibly clean and visually appealing. Also, the staff members were terrific. They were helpful and extremely friendly, yet not overbearing.I thought our room was great. I emailed the resort before I left and requested a room close to the beach, and that is what we got. It was also close to the pool which was great since we spent most of our time there or at the beach.One review mentioned their room was too warm, but I found I had to turn the A/C off a lot because I was freezing. Another review said the A/C was broken the resturants and they were very warm. When we were there, I needed a sweater every time.The food was good and there was always food available. Normally that would have freaked me out since I'm careful about what and how much I eat. However, since I was in my first trimester of pregnancy and needed to eat frequently, it was great. I highly suggest the Japanese restaurant. We ate there twice. Also, if you are there on your honeymoon or celebrating an anniversary, make sure the resort knows. (I included it in the email I sent requesting a room near the beach.) We received a special invitation for dinner at the gormet restaurant to celebrate our anniversay. Instead of the normal set menu, which has lobster as the entree (which my husband doesn't eat), they had a different menu entirely with filet mignon as the main course.Although I have read a few reviews on this site stating people had a poor experience there, I highly recommend it. We are even planning on going back next year.

<Content>NICE... WOULD CHANGE A FEW THINGS This is one of the most beautiful places I've seen in my life. The resort itself can take your breath away. This was my honeymoon and we had a nice stay and we felt very safe there. The beach was beautiful and if it rains the sun is just a couple hours away. The service was the best I've ever imagined and the staff make you feel so welcome and take care of you so well. The room was also very nice with a great bathroom.  I do wish i would have stayed a couple less days... mostly due to the food. The food was very good but it was a little off from what I'm used to here in the states. The food started to get to me after a while because it wasn't quite right.  Also if you aren't used to hot weather it might be a bit rough on you because the rooms don't get that cool. Also all the rooms have a power saving system that shuts off all power to the room when you leave (motion sensors). So the rooms are never really cool off very well and my wife and I were too warm most of the time in our room. There was a very nice breeze at night and we would have to open the door to cool off which shuts off the air conditioning.  The staff is great but few spoke english... this was a very minor problem. The resort is all inclusive so tipping is not expected but if you do you may get your drinks a little quicker. All in all it was a great trip with minor things I would change. I think I would have really enjoyed a 5 day stay... after that I was ready to move on.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro is Awesome! My girlfriend and I are 25 and from New Jersey. We went on a cruise last year and this was our first time at an all-inclusive. We absolutely loved the Iberostar Bavaro and had a great time!Arrival:Our flight was diverted to Orlando after a mechanical problem so it took twice as long to get to Punta Cana as it should have. We got to the small airport with its thatched roof and open-air windows, had to wait in line for souvenir photos to be taken (there is no way around) found our travel company rep and was directed to a bus. We had to wait a while for other people and then it was a bumpy and wild ride flying past slow trucks and mopeds in the wrong lanes. We were served cold drinks as soon as we walked in the resort lobby and greeted by a very friendly and accommodating receptionist. This was a very smooth process after such a long and hectic day getting there. Room:We were in a room on the 2nd floor close to the beach, pool and pool buffet; this was a perfect location. The room was much larger than what it looked like in the pictures, there鈥檚 a sunken living room area with couches, small safe and a patio outside. There鈥檚 a small fridge with soda, beer and water; we tipped daily and requested 鈥渕as agua por favor鈥?and we got more than enough each day. The bathroom was pretty big and had plenty of counter space. I didn鈥檛 notice any musty smells in the room, the maid kept it spotless every day. Resort:The resort was huge, it was much, much bigger than I expected. We didn鈥檛 really use the other 2 resorts much but had full access to their facilities, they couldn鈥檛 use ours. Everything is immaculate, the employees never stop working and everywhere you look they are sweeping, polishing, landscaping etc. they even rake the beach when seaweed washes up. There鈥檚 a small building across from the Dominica we went to each night which had some small shops, the nightclub, a doctors office an internet room (you buy time at the hotel lobby $5us = 30 minutes) and a cigar / liquor shop. We loved the Star Rock Caf茅 which was kind of like a Fridays bar and grill. They had big TVs for watching US sports, good burgers and food, a nice big bar and a cool classic rock theme. The lobby of this building had a guy who hand rolls cigars which was pretty interesting to watch. The casino was small and smoky and we didn鈥檛 go here often; there are little stores in the lobbies and a small street with a bunch of stores, spa and salon. Pool:The pool was really big with little islands in the middle, a swim up bar, sloping entry points. The seats were usually filled up but there were always empty chairs set back under palm trees. It was clean, cool and wasn鈥檛 crowded in the water. There鈥檚 a little juice bar, towel booth and paint your own pottery by the kiddy pool. Beach:The beach was beautiful! We spent every day relaxing here. I got to the beach everyday around 10 and always found empty chairs; we spent some days in the sun and others under the palapas. If you want a palapa close to the water you need to get out there early. Because the resort is predominantly European there were lots of guys running around in Speedos and topless women all over which didn鈥檛 bother me a bit! There are little shops on the beach to the South, you have to bargain with them and start really low because they start prices really high. They get kind of annoying because they try so hard to get you to buy their stuff and come into their shops. The resort has little snack shop / beach bars, bring an insulated travel mug! The Star Friends have sports and activities going on all day. Snorkeling:There鈥檚 a scuba center on the beach that offers free lessons and you can use their snorkel gear. I鈥檇 recommend bringing your own snorkel stuff because you have to fill out all these forms and if you break something it鈥檚 a lot of money. You have to swim around to find clusters of coral and fish but it was pretty cool. I went on a snorkel excursion where they take you on a boat to a reef for an hour and a half, the coral here was beautiful and there were lots of colorful fish. Take an underwater camera and some bread to attract schools of fish. Food:I thought the food was great; the buffets had such a variety that you can鈥檛 try a little bit of everything without getting stuffed. The main buffet had American and European foods, vegetarian, theme stations like Asian one night, Dominican the next. I don鈥檛 see how you can get tired of something because they always had different stuff to try. The employees are always filling your drinks, bringing wine and clearing empty plates. The resort made a Thanksgiving dinner, which had a little Caribbean flair to it. The buffet by the beach had barbecue everyday and then specialty bbq that changed everyday. Try the paella, which is a variety of seafood and rice cooked in a massive pan; shots of mamajuana go great with it. There鈥檚 a little ice cream hut in this area and they play live music some days. There are buffets at the other 2 resorts, which had pretty much the same stuff; we only ate dessert at these. Specialty Restaurants:You need to reserve different nights ahead of time for the specialty restaurants. We went to the gourmet which is temporarily in a conference area but I don鈥檛 think anybody else noticed this, it was still excellent. This is a fixed menu, 5 courses and the grilled lobster is delicious. Our favorite was the Japanese, the food was really good and it was pretty authentic with the d茅cor and Japanese gardens until a little band came in and played Dominican music ?. We also ate at the steak house, which was very good. The 4th restaurant we ate at was the Tropical restaurant, which I didn鈥檛 care for. In addition to these they had Mexican, Chinese / Oriental, Mediterranean and I think one or 2 others. The Star Rock doesn鈥檛 require reservations. Etc:We didn鈥檛 get sick at all, I didn鈥檛 drink tap water and stuck with bottled water even for brushing my teeth. I drank so many beers and mixed drinks, tried every kind of food they had and didn鈥檛 have any problems with my stomach other than gaining a few pounds. I also didn鈥檛 get any mosquito bites or see any for that matter. They are doing a lot of renovation work to rooms off to the right side, the main buffet, the gourmet restaurant and a new path by the pond but only do it during the day when everyone is at the beach and pool.Cons:There is not much not to like about this place. They work so hard to make sure you are having a good time and keep the resort so spotless and manicured it is unbelievable. In my personal opinion I didn鈥檛 enjoy some of the shows at night, there was one called Caribbean Dreams or something like that which was really good though, it was live music, professional dancing. There was a big language barrier, which I expected, I learned some Spanish before hand and got by but wish I understood it better. I would guess there were around 15 - 20% North American guests of the resort, the rest are European so of course there are cultural differences but everyone seemed friendly enough. They had a night when they invited outside vendors come in to set up tables of stuff for sale which we checked out but they were so annoying because you couldn鈥檛 walk a foot without somebody pestering you to buy stuff. The resort stores between IB Bavaro and Dominicana did the same thing, I guess this is just how it鈥檚 done here. I would highly... highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro! I would definitely go back.

<Content>Loved The Iberostar Bavaro We spent 11/18 - 11/25 at the Bavaro Suites and thoroughly enjoyed our Thanksgiving away from the snow and cold of home. We were a group of nine with ages ranging from 4 years to 75 years with a couple of 40 somethings in the mix, two teenagers, 11 year old and an 8 year old.ArrivalThey do take your picture upon entering the airport but if you would rather not just say non gracias politely and they will step aside. You then pay your $10.00 entrance fee and fill out the tourist card and proceed to customs. They barely look at the passports before stamping them and sending you on your way to pick up your luggage. After getting your luggage proceed out to the taxi/bus area where there are booths with all the tour companys and their reps. We were with GOGO tours and they use Prieto as transportation. We do not recommend Prieto Tours at all. They left my mother-in-laws luggage at the airport which we never received for 24 hours and then they forgot to pick us up at the resort for our return which made us so late we almost missed our flight home.The ride to the resort is about 35 minutes on very crowded, unpaved roads.The ResortThe resort was absolutely beautiful. The staff work really hard to please and it shows. The public areas are spotless (even the bathroom near the beach is cleaned every 1/2 hour). The lobby is open-air and very impressive. Check-in was smooth and quick. The staff is extremely friendly, always smiling or singing and always willing to help. A big thank you for Alen at the front desk for locating the missing luggage. All the bungalows are off the main pathway that leads back to the lobby restaurant/main buffet area. The bungalows are 2 story with 8 units in each. We had a 2 King rooms and 1 double/double room. They were very spacious and the maid service was fantastic. The fridge was always stocked. We did tie a bandana around the bathroom facet to remind ourselves not to drink the water. The air conditioning worked great in all of our room. So great in fact that at night we usually turned it off because it was so cold.There is one main pool and a kids pool. The main pool is very large and somewhat cold but refreshing. Plenty of lounge chairs and palapas at all times of the day and plenty of room in the pool for everyone. Towel hut opens at 8:00 and your turn in your towel cards you receive upon arrival. The amount of towel cards you get depends on the amount of people per room. Turn in your towel cards for towels in the morning and either turn in your towels for fresh ones in the afternoon or get your cards back.RestaurantsWe ate at the Main Buffet, Pool Buffet, Gourmet, Steakhouse, Japanese and Mexican (at the Dominica). All were excellent. The only restaurant not airconditioned was the Steakhouse and they don't require long pants for men there. The food was very good at all restaurants and the appetizer buffet at the Mexican was outstanding. The food at the Main Buffet does cater to a more European clientele but there was more than enough to keep everyone full and happy (kids and adults).The BeachWe did rise early to gather lounges and a palapa near the beach but there seemed to be plenty to go around. The water was warm with a rolling surf. There are men that rake the seaweed off the beach every morning. The sand felt wonderful and never got hot on the feet! The adults spent most of the time at the beach with the kids splitting their time between beach and pool. There is topless bathing on the beach but it is really not an issue unless you make it one. We did do one banana boat ride which the older kids had fun but it was very rough for the 8 year old. They do dump you at one point during the ride and this can be quite scary.LanguageSpanish is the native language spoken in the Dominican Republic. We had no trouble communicating and in fact it was quite fun to try speaking Spanish. I didn't expect anyone to speak fluent English given the fact that the clientele of this resort is 85% European (which we found refreshing) and 15% American.Misc.My daughter did get her hair braided at the hotel hair dresser. It was a $1.00 per braid, took 2 houre and she loves it! The gift shops were not all that pricey for souveniers. We did buy some of the pictures of the kids holding a spider monkey (they also offer an iguana and a parrot). They turned out cute and were $8.00 each. We didn't stay up for any shows so I can't comment on that.OverallVery impressive - Non American - Resort. Would love to try the Iberostars elsewhere.

<Content>Don't believe the ads Property beautiful  carefully maintained. Staff, especially those who are at the pool and child care, are above average. Food, also very good. BUT, the Hotel did not deliver what they advertise - had 3 rooms [3 generations celebrating milestones] none of which could they get the A/C to work after many attempts. Five days into our 7 day vacation. they offered to move us. Advertised 5 A/C restaurants but none seemed to work when we visited them. BUT, upon visiting the management office, it was freezing.When asked to be compensated for miserable vacation, we were shot down by both the resort and APPLE VACATIONS. Their contention was since we stayed, there was no reason to offer compensation. When you are 6 adults and 4 young children, where could you go. Since APPLE took the money and wouldn't make any adjustments, I SEE NO REASON FOR ANYONE BOOKING WITH APPLE VACATIONS. Look past the 'deal'.

<Content>Enjoyable Honeymoon My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon after spending Nov 8-13 at the Iberostar Bavaro. We booked our package through Apple Vacations and flew via USAirways. We were scheduled to leave Nov 7, but our first flight was cancelled, which meant we couldn't meet our connection that would have taken us on to Punta Cana. We got the last two seats on an American Airlines flight on Nov 8. We ended up getting to Punta Cana 26 hours later than originally scheduled, but at least we got there (and we were in first class on American Airlines).Upon arriving at the resort, we were promptly handed a welcome drink - Bahama Mama - which was excellent and very refreshing. Check-in went very quickly and we were on our way to our room. We took our own luggage, because we did not want to wait for the hotel staff to deliver it to the room for us. We were given suite #2542, right off the main pathway. It was very close to the pool as well. We had a king-size bed, just like we requested. It was on the first floor and our balcony faced toward other buildings/rooms. We never had a musty smell in our room and the air conditioning always worked well. The minibar was fully stocked and the maid gave us everything we requested. We left a few dollars for the maid every day.The food was hit-and-miss. The selection at the buffet was good. Breakfast was always good. We typically ate lunch at the pool snack area; they had burgers, hot dogs, chicken (which was excellent most days), fries, pasta, sandwiches and various salad items. We ate dinner at the buffet the first night; all other nights were at the specialty restaurants. The Mediterranean was good, although they did not bring me what I ordered. I was given the salmon instead of the grouper, which I decided to eat anyway since it was good. The Japanese was great, although they did not cook in front of us, but rather served us at a table. The Steakhouse was better than we expected. We both had the sirloin, which was cooked exactly as we ordered it and the portion was large. The Gourmet was a disappointment. It was located in an old conference room and the ambience was bad. The food was very delicate and only mediocre in taste. We left the restaurant and went to the buffet to complete our dinner that evening.The pool and beach were great! We spent half our time at each. The pool was always very cold, which was generally refreshing in the hot Dominican sun. The swim-up bar was great! The depth varies greatly, which is excellent. It is not the biggest pool ever, but large enough to support the crowd. There were always open chairs, though not always in the shade. However, we rarely had a big problem finding the chairs we wanted. Same at the beach... palapas were always available, though shaded ones were less easy to come by. The beach has several rocky areas just as you enter the ocean. Be careful where you step. Some areas are soft  sandy. Find those and then always enter the ocean at them. The waves are not big enough to boogie board. We did not see many folks kayaking. We tried snorkelling one day, but didn't find too many fish. The surf is a bit rough, making snorkelling tough. We did not take any day trips, mainly because the selection was limited. We wanted to horse-back ride, but due to animal cruelty, no one offered that option. The only item we purchased to bring back home was coffee. We were given a free bottle of rum because it was our honeymoon, which we also brought back home. Cigars, vanilla, art, jewelry and several other items were being sold at the resort and at the market down the beach to the right of the resort. Be sure to bargain at both the resort  the market.We did not spend much time at the Domincana or Punta Cana Iberostars. The Bavaro is the best of the three and we saw no need to visit the other two for very much. The complex is very large and somewhat confusing in layout. Take your map with you!! We gambled $20 playing blackjack one evening. We lost it all in a matter of minutes. They are not very careful with how they shuffle, deal or talk to customers, so beware!Overall, we had a great time at the resort and would recommend it to others. However, we have stayed at Iberostar Paraiso in Riviera Maya, Mexico and would recommend that resort over the Iberostar Bavaro. You really can't go wrong at either complex, though!! Enjoy!

<Content>Great Value We just returned from a week at the IB Bavaro. This was our 5th trip to Punta Cana. We have been to All-Inclusives in Jamaica and Riviera Maya as well. This being said, I felt that the IB was as good, if not better than the rest in most catagories. Stay at the IB Bavaro and not the IB Dominican or IB Punta Cana. Our food selection, quality and services seemed much better. Also, we could go to their restaurants and bars but they couldn't use ours.Food: The selection, presentation and taste of the food at the IB was the best overall of all the resorts at which I've stayed. Was everything a winner? No. But overall, very good. We ate at the main buffet for breakfasts and 2 dinners. Large selection and good quality. For lunch everyday, we ate at the pool buffet. Yes it was outdoors (undercover) but we saw almost no flies and the hot foods were hot and the cold were cold. A bonus, everyday they grill on a large open grill. The london Broil was excellent! As to the specialty restaurants, we ate at the Steakhouse (great taste but just a tad tough, not bad though) the seafood (the app buffet was great. Garlic shrimp, Grouper fingers, red and black caviar, etc.) the mexican (again, great app buffet but OK on the meal). We also asked about any special nights. DO THIS!!! There was a romantic dinner on Friday night which was invitation only. By asking, we got invited. Champagne, (all women get long stem roses) a salad with Lobster and shrimp, and a large, perfectly cooked and great tasting Filet Mignon. By far, one of the best meals I have ever had at any all inclusive. (It also gave us a 4th night at a specialty restaurant!) We went to the Sports bar for dinner Sunday to watch the game. Menu looked great (Burgers, buffalo wings, nachos, etc) but I was disappointed with the food. No problem, buffets are open until 10ish and room service is 24 hour and is included. All in all, if you go hungry here, something's wrong with you not the hotel.Room: At the IB Bavaro, all rooms have a sunken seating area with couch and love seat. Nice touch. Nice room, nothing fantasic but very comfortable. They did have patios, cable, fridges, irons and hair dryers. The only thing missing was a coffee maker. From what I've read, I guess some do and some don't. Try to get one as close to the beach as possible as the resort is large. Call or email ahaed. We did and got a pretty good location. If you want extra pillows, towels, toiletries, water, beer,soda, etc, just leave a note or call the desk and the maid will get it for you.Pool: Nice pool. Not as large as some but never felt crouded. They clean every morning and skim throughout the day. The swim up bar is a must! Spent a lot of time in the late afternoons there. (Ask Lely for a cooccaracha!) The chaise situation could be a little better, but it would be tough to fit many more around the pool. We were always looking for 4 together in the early afternoon. Getting 2 no problem, but 4 was harder. We always managed to find something though.Service: From check-in to check-out, the people in the DR are great. If you don't speak spanish, learn a few simple things, like thank you and please! They go a long way. They do try very hard to help even if there English isn't that good. Also, bring some singles and reward their efforts. They make a salary of about $140 month for 12 hr days. So, anything extra really helps them and their families.Other: The shows were fine. Not Broadway but you aren't paying $80 a ticket either. The shows with audience participation are always fun. The beach is beautiful, but they all are in Punta Cana. Never had a problem getting chaises. The biggest negative, beer selection. Basically, Presidante, Bohemia and 1 other. (not bad but I do like a choice) Also, no bottled water at any bars, only in your room (restocked everyday, but not real convienient if you ran out on the beach)I would reccomend this hotel to all but the snootiest travelers....let them go to Punta Gorda in the Virgin Islands and pay 4 to 5 times as much for not nearly as good a time.

<Content>Nice Vacation but Wouldn't go back We just retuned from a week鈥檚 stay at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana. Since I spent quite a bit of time on this site before we left, I figure I should also write a review! Overall we had a great trip. The Iberostar Bavaro is a nice resort, and the people there are great. We tipped everywhere we went and I would encourage others to bring singles to do the same. Even a few bucks means a lot to these people. Their faces light up鈥攜ou鈥檒l get great service either way though.I will start out by saying that we because we stayed at the Riu Palace the year before, we had something to compare the Iberostar Bavaro to. Our favorite things about the Iberostar:1.The beach is beautiful. There aren鈥檛 tons of palm trees to block the sun but there are little huts you can sit under if you want to avoid the sun. We never had a problem getting one either. The bar on the beach was our favorite too. The French fries are great. The beach is very clean, and they rake the seaweed every day and the water is a great temp and great for a raft.2.By staying at the Bavaro there is a lot to choose from. You can eat at any of the restaurants at the Bavaro, the Dominicana or the Punta Cana. Plus they have a sports bar, casino, a nice gym. We ate at the Japanese, Mediterranean and Gourmet. The Japanese was very good. We were not as impressed with the Gourmet though it was tasty.3.Room Service. There is 24-hour room service. Nice when you get home from the beach, at night etc鈥攅specially if you don鈥檛 feel like going to the 鈥渟nack area鈥?br/>4.The people. Like I said above, the Dominicans are extremely nice and go out of their way to make your vacation a good one.Some things we did not like:1.How the food was served. My biggest problem with the Iberostar was not the type or selection of food. I actually thought the food was not bad. What bothered me most was the unsanitary conditions. Because the main buffet area is not all the way enclosed, there is no air conditioning. Food sits out and there are tons of flies. We saw people not using tongs and one women was actually standing over the food coughing. Some of these problems are just inherent to buffets, but in the Riu I did not think of sanitation at all, and at the Iberostar, I thought about it every time I ate. A fly stuck in the mayo, one in my drink etc. By the end of the week, I was trying to eat only in the restaurants, the pool bar and room service. We did not get sick at all, but it still bothered me. I guess it just depends how sensitive you are to this sort of thing.2.Our room. Our room was on the older side and had a very strong smell of mildew. I think this is to be expected in such a humid climate, but it was overpowering. We did not have this problem at all at the Riu. Even after washing our clothes once or twice at home, we are still smelling the smell. I literally washed everything I had with me at least once.Overall we had a great vacation. If we go back to the DR, we will most likely stay at the Riu Palace though where the rooms are much nicer and eating is not as much of a cattle call. Just us though鈥攖he Iberostar could make for a perfect vacation for many.

<Content>Thumbs up! My family of four just returned from a 7 day stay at the Iberostar Punta Cana suites. It was our first trip to the Carribean, so we didn't know what to expect. We had a great time. Our children (ages 6  8) loved the pool, so we spent all day there. The breakfast and lunch buffet give you plenty of choices, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. We were with a party of 11, so we ate at the specialty restaurants every night. We only ate at the gourmet, mediterranean and steak restaurants. The mediterranean was the best, if you like seafood. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. The weather was nice 6 of the 7 days we were there. A high percentage of the visitors are European, so there was a lot of German and French spoken.

<Content>Wonderful honeymoon!! We just returned from our honeymoon at the Iberostar Bavaro and had a fabulous time!! We found the grounds to be beautiful and very well maintained, our room was very clean, and we thought the food was very good. We enjoyed the Mediterranian, Steakhouse, and the gourmet restaurants. We were even invited for a special romantic honeymoon/anniversary dinner one evening at the gourmet restaurant, which was fantastic. The staff was terrific at all of the restaurants and really went out of their way to ensure that you had a good meal. Also, tipping was appreciated....those people were working so hard and VERY long days.....many of them seemed to be working at 16 hour days. Take advantage of the inclusive water sports - we had alot of fun snorkeling and kayaking! The catamaran lesson and the banana boat rides were worth the extra money as well...a little scary for me, but my husband enjoyed both! Beach is picture perfect! If you're looking for a totally relaxing vacation, then this is a good choice....the nightlife wasn't the best part, but we didn't mind too much:) Highly recommend trying the Iberostar! Enjoy!!

<Content>Beautiful  We booked our honeymoon through Apple Vacations for the destination to Punta Cana staying at the Iberostar Bavaro for a stay from October 10-17, 2005. This was our first trip to ANY island. It was better that what i expected. We were both impressed at how well everything was maintained and how all of the staff worked very hard to make sure you enjoyed the stay. We took full advantage of being able to go to the other two resorts there (Dominicana  Punta Cana, both Iberostar Resorts). We mostly ate from the buffets. We did eat at the Tropical and Mexican Restaurants, which both were fantastic! We were both pleased with the trip. Customs, security and the flight were great (it was my first flight ever).The european women are topless on the beach. It was a shock at first, but after the 2nd day it was fine. Brush up on your spanish! We got by with only a few words, but it would be a great help if you knew some spanish. Most of the bartenders and wait staff know english, but they speak very broken up english and it is hard to understand them sometimes. We usually pointed at the menu when we were ordering. It rained 6 of the 7 days that we were there. It was really nice in the A.M. then around 2 or so, it got all cloudy and rained the rest of the evening and all night. the walkways are EXTREMELY slippy! BE CAREFUL!If there are any specific questions about the resort, please feel free to drop me an email at Buttrfly0713@aol.comMr  Mrs Coles

<Content>hated the food a bit disapointing - the food becomes incredibly boring after about three days - the buffet is better than the restaurants which with the exception of the star rock cafe are just plain bad - the staff are very friendly and helpful but if the sun don't shine you'll go off your nut with boredomall in all 5/10

<Content>Our Dream Honeymoon Destination We chose the Iberostar Bavaro for our honeymoon after our June Wedding. It was our first time in the Caribbean so we had nothing to compare it too. However we were not dissapointed on any aspect of the resort itself, just our local rep out there who turned up when she felt like it!! The hotel itself is set in magnificant gardens and it's easy to find your way around. We arrived in the dark and had a little difficulty finding our front door as there are 4 doors on each side of the block (2 up stairs and 2 down) and a sign in the garden giving the room numbers. However we put this down to our 4 hour delay, 10 hour flight and airport transfer, all after our very brief wedding night, so we were very very sleep deprived!! However the next day we awoke to the sound of the peacocks and realised we were in Paradise. The staff were attentive from the moment we entered the reception lobby. A complimentary glass of Banana Mamma while we were briefed on the check in procedure and then given our directions to our rooms, a safe key and procedure for booking the restaurants. You can catch a buggy to your room if you wanted but after our long flight we were keen to stretch our legs a bit. The Porters take care of your luggage and it's brought to your room within minutes of you arriving there by foot. I must say that there was a smell from the Air con but it didn't ruin our trip. Once you work out what it is you tend to not notice it after a couple of days. The humidity is so high out there though that you just can't live without it so it's a small price to pay. We went to the main buffet restaurant for our dinner and a very kind waitress explained where everything was and the procedure. Basically you find your own table, they bring over water (it's filtered so safe to drink) and wine (not for the faint hearted) and then you just head off for your food. They clear your dishes while you go up for each course. The food here was excellent and all the restaurants were very clean (spotless in fact). Neither of us suffered from any stomach complaint. You must not clean your teeth in the tap water (use bottled) and try not to swallow any water in the shower. Most of the Americans seemed to complain of stomach upsets but none of the Brits who were there at the time had any problems. Maybe because Brits never ever drink tapwater when abroad - who knows. We also used the Japanese, Steak, Mexican, Mediteranean and A La Carte Restaurants while we were there. The Japanese was our favourite closely followed by the A La Carte (food was a bit rich in the heat). Don't worry about the steak or Mediteranean restaurants too much as you can get pretty much everything served there at the Main Buffet Restaurant. The evening ambience was lively up near Reception but a bit samey each night. You get totally hooked on the Club Anthem as it's sung every night but after a few glasses of champagne you find yourself tapping along. It's best to eat at around 9pm and then catch the end of the show otherwise you either get caught up in the kids show or hauled up by one of the 'Star Friends' for a dance so beware!! Overall we rated the level of food and drinks quality and service far higher than we imagined.It's best to get down to the pool or beach early. Beware - Americans are the new Germans!! They lay out their towels as early as 7.30 to bag the best sunbeds and then you don't see them for most of the day!! What's the point? We wandered down to the pool or beach at about 9am most days, got decent sunbeds, caught some early sun (less intense) and then took breakfast in the pool restaurant. That way you don't feel so guilty about leaving your towels on the sunbed while you go off for breakfast. All the pool area is kept clean and the toilets are cleaned every half hour. The whole complex is spotless and we couldn't fault this at all. Our room was cleaned daily and linen changed every other day. Leave $2 for the maid each day and she'll top your mini bar up every day rather than every other as is the hotel policy. She'll even fan out your nightdress or robe and leave flowers in the towels sculptures. They see to every detail.The beach is fantastic. Very sandy but it doesn't get too hot. There are plenty of sunbeds and parasols to go round. If you get bored you can stroll along to the tented market stalls but beware - it's cheaper in the hotel gift shop. These guys will really try to rip you off so you have to stand your ground. Just walk away and they more than half the price. Don't be afraid to haggle - they love it. Note though that the gift shop is fixed price. However we noticed that the shop at Bavaro was cheaper than the one at the sister hotel nextdoor (Dominicana). It may be that they see your Bavaro coloured bracelet and think you have more money!! Buy your suntan lotion from Bavaro if you can. There are also some shops in the walkway between the hotels. You can haggle here. You can also get a good price in the Jewellery shop here. We didn't use the gym or any of the facilities at the other hotels. We didn't see the point - we paid for the better of the 3 hotels so why downgrade ourselves- their pools were busy and there were more kids on the loose!! However we did have a massage on the beach and we really recommend this. They find all the knots and knead them out for you. You have to pay for this but it's something like 拢12 so well worth it. The only negative thing I can think off is that the middle pool was out of action being painted for about 5 days out of the two weeks. This caused quite a lot of overflow around the other two pools but we understood the necessity of this maintenance. They guys worked hard day and night to get the job done. On tipping, think about the gardeners and the guy who brings you your water in the restaurants. These people all work incredibly hard yet earn very little, most of which they send home to their familys to support them. If you get the chance to go on the Domincian Experience Tour then do. It will really open your eyes to what these people have to live like yet they don't complain and they always have a smile on their face. We took $200 in single $ notes and used up most of it in tips. Not because you have too but because you learn to appreciate everything they do. One note about money - if you're British make sure you bring US$ and NOT Dominican Currency. You get a better deal on goods and trips. They can only give change in Dominican currency so you're short changed if you bring $ in large denominations. Bring singles for the tips and lots of 10's and 20's. Overall we rated this resort highly. It was a magical time for us and an experience we'll always treasure.

<Content>Very Satisfied We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro Palace for spring break 2005. The beach is magnificent, the golf is adequate but certainly convenient, the shows are good, the rooms are fine, and there's much for kids to do.

<Content>"Absolutely Fantastic Vacation"...... This started out as a 7 night vacation and was extended by 3 days because we loved it so much. We arrived at the Punta Cana airport on 9/9, took the picture, paid our $10.00 and off to the resort. The bus ride to the resort was bumpy but nothing really to complain about.We arrived at the resort and the lobby was beautiful. They greeted us with a drink and toasted us to a wonderful vacation. Our room was not ready upon our arrival which was okay with us as we walked around and got acquainted with the resort. When we went back to reception as directed our room was still not ready yet. Since the room wasn't ready when they said it would be we were told that the next day they would transfer us to an ocean front room. We finally got our room (really not a long wait) and it was very comfortable. The fridge was stocked with water, beers and sodas. The very next day as told by reception they transferred us to our ocean front room, which was exactly like our original room but with a much better view as we were right there with the beach and ocean.The grounds at this resort are spectacular and maintained meticulously. There are beautiful palms, tropical foilage and ponds with various birds, ducks and flamingos. There are also peacocks walking around which we loved - not messy nor were they noisy.The pool was was great - warm yet refreshing. The pool area had plenty of chairs and palapas for those who want shade. The beach......ahhhhh.........what a beach!!! Loved it, loved it, loved it!! Again plenty of lounge chairs and palapas. The water is clear with plenty of areas for snorkeling, which we did and saw plenty of fish.The workers at this resort are exceptional people. The dominican people are the friendliest people I've ever met. Very interesting to talk with and always smiling. What's nice is they remember your name. The food was fine. There is something on the buffet for everyone. If you can't find something on the buffet to eat and enjoy - tough for you!! I'm a pickly eater but managed to leave dinner every night very satisfied. We ate at the Mediterrean Restaurant, Gourmet Restaurant and the Steak House. My favorite was the Steak House and really enjoyed the Ribeye. We ate at the Steak House 3 nights. Very good. The other restaurants were good as well but my favorite was the Steak House. The servers at the restaurants whether it was the buffets or ala carte restaurants were outstanding. They do their absolute best to accommodate whatever it is you want. The Star Friends (animation people) were great. They always had someting going on around the pool area and if want to participate they welcomed you and understood if you just wanted to spectate. We're spectators ourselves - had lots of fun watching people. The shows at night were entertaining and fun - it's not Broadway but fun nonetheless.The bars as well as everything else mentioned above were great. We're not big drinkers but the slushy drinks were oh sooooo good.Although tipping is not necessary we did tip. Not to get any special service but because these people truly go above and beyond what's expected of them. This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic as we normally vacation in Mexico, particularly in the Riveria Maya area. We've been there about 5 times and thought how could anything be better....we found it in Punta Cana. We stayed at exceptional resorts in Mexico such as they Aventura Spa Palace and would say that the Iberostar Bavaro matched or exceeded this resort.As you can tell by this review we have absolutely no complaints. We will absolutely go back to Punta Cana and will again stay at the Iberostar Bavaro.If you have any questions about the resort please feel free to e-mail me at moerne@msn.com. This was an Apple Vacation and was booked through Go Away Travel, which I've used in the past and will continue to use as they make trip planning a breeze. Check out their website at goawaytravel.com. My agent is Jenn Monroe who does an outstanding job.Enjoy your trip and take special notice to the beautiful grounds and the kindest people on earth.

<Content>Beautiful Resport Returned from the Iberostar Bavaro on Sept 11. Went with a group of 5 friends ages 24-28. The resort is beautiful and well layed out. The staff was amazing! We did tip, but never felt that it was necessary, I actaully don't feel our service was any better becasue of tipping. We did leave money for the housekeepers with notes requesting more beer and water everyday, and we were given more than enough. All in all the staff really made our vacation better.The beach was beautiful, and the pool was very nice. In the morning the pool was colder and clean, but by lunch time the water would warm up considerably because of the sun, and the pool (by the swimup bar) would get rather dirty. This wasn't a big deal because it was so hot, you still wanted to get in. We had amazing weather the entire week, but it was cloudy one day and we needed it. It is VERY hot though, so be prepared. The food was good, but after a few days of eating the same thing, it did get a little borning. We only were able to get into the Gourmet and the Steak House, both were good. We wanted to try the Mexican restaraunt, but could not get in. It is important to remember when they say you can have reservations at the specialty restaraunts, it may not be the ones you would like to go to. The breakfast and dinner buffets were the best. The one thing we did run into that was bad was there was very little to do in or around the resort. We did going on the snorkeling excursion where you swim with sharks. It was very neat, but a little too planned out. You had to follow a leader when snorkeling instead of being able to go where you wanted, although this was understandable when we were in with the sharks. It was worth the money though. There is very little night life. The shows were ok, but nothing too great. The male beauty pagent was the best. The disco didn't open until 11, so it was hard to really want to stay up for that at times. One other thing to note about the disco, every other night the staff comes to do a dance contest. The pick people from the crowd and dance with them, this was fine for awhile, but it does last very long and no one else can really dance during this. It really changes the night when you are dancing and having fun, and then have to stop to watch a contest for an hour. Overall this was a great resort, I did think it was much nicer than the Dominican and Punta Cana Iberostar's and worth spending a little more to go here. With nothing much to do at night though, this wasn't exactly what our group was looking for. So be prepared to do A LOT of relaxing.

<Content>Okay but not great Just returning from my trip and would like to share my experience:- I may have been lucky but September seems to be a great season to go to Dominican Republic. Weather was great (except half a day or so) and it was not crowded (actually even a bit less than at the adjacent hotels... I think Iberostar Dominicana, Punta Cana, and Riu)- the food is decent, and no, I didn't get sick- the speed boat / snorkeling excursion was fun. Driving back the boat under the heavy rain was a memorable experience g- it is true that sometimes you wake up with cigarette smell in your room. The AC must be shared between the 4-apartment units.- there was a smell of humidity in the room upon arrival, but the smell was gone after a day running the AC- evening entertainment is very poor (talking about the shows). Having been to a Barcelo Hotel in Mexico, the shows there were great in comparison.- water sports equipment is falling apart (windsurfing). You have to sign a lengthy contract saying that you borrow the equipment in prime condition and that you may be liable for any damage upon return. Fortunately, the hotel didn't charge me for the preexisting damages.- there is not much to do in Punta Cana. Santo Domingo is 3 hour drive each way.- tour operator representative (Gogo vacation) was hard to find and so I didn't do too many excursions (which turned out to be good after hearing other people's comments).- tour operator rep woke me up one morning at 7AM to sell me some excursions on the phone.- strolling on the beach will lead you to some shacks with locals trying to rip you off (they quoted me $250 for two paintings, which quickly came down to $90 after they saw the look on my face. You could buy the same two paintings for $60 at the hotel's shop)- $149 is the price for scuba diving (pool + 2 dives in the ocean). Quite expensive but you can go elsewhere: past the shacks on the beach, you can find another water sports center (I think the name is Pelican something) and dive for $80 (+8% if you pay by credit card) the first time, and $49 thereafter. One dive was sufficient for me. Diving is not as great as in Mexico (ocean side...). You can do everything cheaper there and people are nice too (Paco and Laoga...). Tried parasailing ($45) and banana ride. The banana ride was the most fun, and it's only $6.That's all I can think right now. Overall, the Bavaro Hotel is okay. It looks better than the other two adjacent Iberostar hotels, but if I were to go back to Dominican Republic, I would try somewhere else (maybe north, or closer to historic towns, or on the other side of the island for better diving).

<Content>best family vacation!!! My husband, 2 yr old daughter and I stayed at Iberostar Bavaro 9/2-9/9. We had the best time ever. We plan on going back sometime next year.It is a beautiful well maintained resort. We loved the beach and pool.Our room was always clean and the mini bar was always stocked. The food was really good, plentiful and a big variety.The Animation Team was awesome. All the people down there are such hard workers and super friendly. Yeah so what that you have to tip...hello people this is a third country and what's a few dollars...if you can afford to go there you can afford to tip.We were very sad to leave.

<Content>a great get away what a great hotel with great food beautiful grounds and the most freindly people. It was the most relaxing holiday we have ever had but if you like a more livlier holiday dont worry its avaliable. The rooms are clean and the mini bar was kept well stocked. The pool was never over crowded but the sunbeds were bagged from 7.30. The choice of food was very good, you could never go hungry or thirsty. We are a couple in our 40s and we took our 17yr old daughter with us.The concerns we had about her being on her own was soon dismissed, she found lots of friends and we felt completly at ease with her having freedom around the complex. The beach was remarkabe with good shade (YOU NEED IT), the sea was blue and very clear. What more could you ask for? in our eyes nothing. We took a helicopter flight it took us around the coast and over inland we seen fantastic veiws. Well we WILL return to the iberoster punta cana, dont know when but i hope its not going to be to long.

<Content>Did I stay at the same resort as some of you? Please understand that I probably come from a little different perspective鈥 have 30 years in Hotel and Food and Beverage experience.The Good: Absolutely beautiful resort, grounds, pool and beach are better than any along the entire strip, plenty of chairs, drinks were served and the beach was cleaned...take a walk north up the beach passed Bavaro  Dominicana.Friendly staff, room was well maintained, our A/C was set on snow storm.... if there isn't a big enough selection in the mini bar - drink yourself into oblivion at one of the other half dozen all inclusive bars...Take a SCUBA lesson...my first time diving...very patient, nice dive, can't wait to do it again.Animation Team is friendly, most speak four languages fluently, and they list all of the day鈥檚 activities for the week on the board...but they don't push you into anything.The Bad: People who come to a third world country and expect everyone should speak English because they do...HOLA and a smile goes a long way.People who complain that the food is average after going back to the buffet for the third trip, two hours after they grazed at the ice cream stand, the lunch buffet, and are already scoping out the late night food...So they gave you a half lobster...ask them for another - several people did.BTW, electric refrigeration plates are used to keep food chilled as opposed to having ice melt into everything in 90 degree weather- cheese sweats because of the cold plate, the hot room and then fat content鈥verything was well chilledThere were a couple areas of the pool which needed resurfacing, they were working on the fountain in the lobby, several groups of rooms, and painting near the plaza area...they're open 365...they can only do so much at a time.The Ugly:If they kept the pool open after dark and your kid drowned you'd complain about that...If your 17-21 year old drank them selves into oblivion... keep a close eye on them when they come home鈥? The FRIENDS team seemed to be working with kids well into the shows each nightMake your restaurant reservations ASAP鈥heck back mid day to see if they have any cancellation reservations available鈥ives you extra days in some restaurantsI found the people to be very hardworking and friendly, they took care of anything we asked for...btw, we attempted to communicate in very broken Spanish - but it was appreciated.Outback Safari was a great day...saw a lot of the country, OMAR was a great guide, went to a private beach, coco, and coffee plantation as well as a typical home and lunch on a ranch - they donate part of the proceeds of logo merchandise to local schools...The ride is definitely rough; the roads are an experience鈥nd take sun block.We went to the dollar store and took an entire carry-on of school supplies for the kids...(it will also give you a bag to bring home, rum, cigars, cheap cigarettes, and Dominican coffee) - skip the ma - ma- juana - it tastes like formula 44 cough syrup.We had an amazing time...

<Content>Much better than we expected! We are a family of four--a married couple in our 30's with two kids--5 and 2. My husband, two kids and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro resort from 09/02 through 09/05/05. We booked our vacation through Apple vacations. We've traveled with Apple before to the Bahamas, and had really liked their service, so decided to book through them again. Check-in and Arrival: We checked in about an hour and a half before the flight from Cleveland to Punta Cana. Check in was smooth and efficient at the USA 3000 counter. We stopped for a brief 45 minutes at Pittsburgh to pick up the passengers there, and were off to Punta Cana. They showed us a movie, and provided free meal service, and head phones.The Punta Cana airport is simply beautiful--nothing like I've ever seen before. It is like this huge open air hut with a thatched roof, and stone walls. The tourist cards took a long time to fill out--longer than I anticipated. There were porters trying to take charge of our luggage, but we declined their help, as the Apple rep is right around the corner and the bus to take us to the resort is only a few feet away from the Immigration exit. We had to wait for about 20 minutes in the airconditioned bus for everyone to board before the bus took off. Our bus had passengers only from the three Iberostar resorts that are next to each other--Dominicana, Punta Cana and Bavaro, and the bus stopped at Dominicana first, and then at Bavaro. We left our luggage at the resort lobby, checked in, and headed off to the Buffet for lunch. Food: The Main buffet is simply beautiful--Las Vegas style with many stations. The food definitely caters more to Europeans than Americans. My husband and I were very impressed with the salad, bread, cheese, entree and dessert selection. It wasn't too hard to find something for the two year old--there were always french fries, rice, pasta, bread and cheese. But our five year old had a tough time finding something she liked. I can totally understand why some people hated the food. It is simply hard to find anything similar in taste to American food. But if you don't go in expecting that, you will find lots of things that you like. Our 5 year old finally did settle for bacon and toast for breakfast every morning, and chicken for lunch, and pasta for dinner.We always had lunch at the Pool Buffet. Most everyone eats there during lunch time as you can stay in your swim suits and hop back into the pool or beach after lunch. Again, there are many stations here--salads, desserts, entrees, and the regular grilled stuff like hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken burgers, and steak. The food tasted good, but again, very different from what we would be used to in the US.We tried two a la carte restaurants--the Japanese and the Steakhouse. The Japanese restaurant was excellent--I had sushi, and tempura for appetizers, soup and grilled octopus for the main course, and fried banana with icecream for dessert. They had a decent kids menu, but our five year old actually ordered chicken teriyaki from the adult menu. We couldn't get a dinner reservation for the first night we were there because they were all booked, so I suggest that if you want to dine at an a la carte on all nights, make your reservations at 3 PM, instead of waiting till 5 PM like we did. They had lobster for dinner at the Main Buffet on the day we didn't go to the a la carte, and that made up for it. None of us fell sick from the food, and we practically tried everything, except for some of the fruit in the buffet. They had ripe mangoes at the fruit counter, and we binged everyday on those for dessert. Grounds: The grounds are clean, well kept and out of this world. We took most of our pictures on the grounds. They have peacocks, peahens, a couple of cats, and hens with baby chicks on the grounds. Surprisingly, I didn't see even a single bird dropping anywhere. Our room was right next to the pool, and on the beach. We didn't have to tip (bribe:):)?) anyone for it. The grounds are huge, and our stroller came in very handy to take the little one around. We wish we had taken the extra pain of bringing a second stroller for the five year old though. She sometimes got a bit tired of walking so much, and ended up in the stroller, while our two year old walked..:). Language: Language was not really a problem, except for the fact that all staff does speak Spanish as a default, and you kind of have to answer in English, and they know just enough English to understand you. Certainly don't expect to have an actual conversation with any of the staff if you don't know Spanish. But like I said, if you are prepared for that, they know enough English to understand what you need. Apple gives you a small handbook with Spanish phrases and that comes in very handy.Pool: The children got a big kick out of swimming up to the pool bar, and sipping their lemonade on the bar stools inside the pool. Children are allowed to swim up to the bar and get lemonade and other virgin drinks, but we only took them there mid-morning. Mid-afternoon, it gets kind of crowded with adults near the bar, and by mid evening, the crowd at the pool bar seemed to get a little rowdy with all the drinking.Beach: The beach is extremely clean, but the sea does toss up a little seaweed by the end of the day. There is no coral, or shells on the beach, and the waves are gentle and not rough like those of the Atlantic Ocean. The water is this amazing turquoise blue especially around noon. It turns grayish blue towards late evening when the sun is not shining down directly on it. You might want to take most of your beach pictures around mid-afternoon if you want to capture the true color of the Carribean sea.There are quite a few topless European women on the beach, sunbathing or taking a walk. But like someone said, it looked very natural, and the kids didn't even notice them. The crowd seemed to be 80% European and 20% American. We walked over to the Dominicana side one evening to check it out. They have a nice icecream counter right on the beach that the kids enjoyed, but that side is definitely more crowded, and also FULL of kids. Palapas also seemed to be all taken on the Dominicana side. We didn't have to reserve palapas at any time on any day at IB Bavaro, and had no issues finding a nice palapa right next to the pool or the ocean at any time of the day. It is very hot and humid, but not uncomfortable. Service: Can't complain! The Dominicans are THE friendliest ppl I've ever met! There were not too many kids in the resort at this time of the year, but it was very kid friendly. The staff are always smiling and trying to make conversation with the kids, and singing as they go about their work. The staff even gave our girls Spanish pet names--'Chi-Chi' and 'Chiquita', and they would refer to them by these names whenever they walked into the Main Buffet.  Room: Our room didn't smell musty at all--it was very fresh and clean. The kids slept on the couches in the sitting area the first night, and from the second night onwards, the housekeeping staff removed the cushions and set them up as beds complete with pillows and bedding. We did see a few tiny ants on the balcony, but that didn't bother us much. Our 2 year old spent most of her time on the couch in the balcony while we were in the room. She didn't want to stay indoors. The Air-Conditioning stayed on even when we were not in the room, though it does go off if the balcony door is left open. We didn't take any of the excursions because we only stayed there for four days. We tipped the housekeeping a couple of dollars everyday, and they restocked our refrigerator with bottled water everyday. They also leave a gallon of bottled water in the cabinet next to the refrigerator, and we used that for brushing our teeth. Hubby did forget to use bottled water everytime he brushed his teeth, and would use the tap water by habit, but luckily that didn't cause any sickness issues.Like someone said, the hair dryer they have in the bathroom is not the best, and blows air at full speed, so if you are into setting your hair everyday you might want to take your own hair dryer along. I simply blow-dried my hair with theirs, and had it up in a pony tail during the day. At night, I left it loose in beach waves, and never set it.  All in all, the vacation was great value for the money. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to relax and chill out in beautiful surroundings.

<Content>Second visit in 1 year -  Having had a super honeymoon in April 04, our experience at the Bavaro was so good, I had to share it with my Mammy (as we say in Ireland!) and boy, did she love it too!In her very words on our first morning, my 73 year old Mammy said, as she stood on the beach  if heaven is half as good as here, we will be OK - and she meant it from the heart too.Everything was as we remember it... hotel, food, shows - all up to a great standard - we never left the resort  never needed or wanted to!Some of your reviewers (mostly American I may add) complain about anything, as I read this website on a regular basis to bring me back to Bavaro - I wonder what planet they actually live on sometimes!I hope to see you next year - I know my mam would go too if we could move it closer to Ireland! Thanks to all for the lovely photos - they are great to look at!Christine  Brendan Melody

<Content>Overall: Worth It for Wedding or otherwise My wife and I just had our wedding there on the sand. If you don't mind gawking topless babes and guys in speedos taking pictures of your wedding (which I don't; I found it funny) then the beach is a gorgeous place to stage the wedding. The mariachi serenade was great. Main complaint: we had a member of the hotel staff serve as the official (we had already married on paper in the States). She wore her regular hotel uniform and was not the most dynamic officiator (she is however, an extremely dedicated, excellent wedding planner is highly recommended for that purpose). The hotel photographers can make the ceremony seem very staged in an in-your-face kind of way, as well. However, overall effect for all guests and the wedding party was extreme satisfaction.The so-called gourmet menu (grouper) for the wedding from the Ballena restaurant was far from it, but again, the overall effect was great. Friends who stayed at an AMHSA Grand Paradise gushed about how excellent the Iberostar Bavaro/Punta Cana/Dominicana drinks are compared to theirs. Room Mini bar really is unlimited. I don't know if it's because I'm an American, but my experience with service industry employees, even in European cities like Paris, is that they like tips. Sure, you know the difference between a waiter who treats you well from the get-go, and one who is solely influenced by tipping. In the DR, 10 percent is automatically added for service at a regular, non-hotel restaurant, but an extra 10 is expected if the service was good (try leaving a Parisian restaurant without leaving an extra couple of Euros for the snooty [--] serving you...just kidding....love the French). Also, when I see pregnant women in their third trimester cleaning rooms, and I know some of them commute an hour to work every day and live in a dusty, hot town/village, I don't mind shelling out a couple of bucks for the maid every day. It really does get you a lot of extras.The pool was nice-looking but unimpressive. Love the beach volleyball. Didn't do too many water activities in the beach other than swim. The nightclub is small but fun, as is the karaoke joint next door. The casino is small but will satisfy a gambling junky---Plaza Bavaro has another one a cab ride away. Japanese restaurant was good, perhaps not on the expertly authentic level, but satisfying (drink more sake). Although the hotel is big, it has an intimate neighborhood feel with ample foliage, landscaping and peacocks running around (they roost on some of the first floor balconies and sound like a girl having sex when they cry; I'm not kidding); also, ask if your room is in front of a construction site, as they are building rooms in certain places.All in all, a great experience. Be prepared to either sweat and be hot a lot, or sit under fans and sweat less, or stick to the A/C joints, because DR is very very warm in August, and most of the resort is open air. I would definitely recommend this hotel or its sister hotels. P.S. there's an excursion to Altos de Chavon and Isla Catalina (whole day) for 89 dollars per person. Highly recommended; it's not officially on any brochures, just ask the Prieto Tours guy near the lobby bar.

<Content>Fantastic - can't wait to go back Hi, we returned from the Iberostar Bavaro 2 weeks ago and find it hard to find fault with anything. The room was kept beautifully clean and the mini bar well stocked every day, they now have irons and ironing boards in the rooms as well which was great. The food was very good, the steak house was a particular favourite followed closely by the gourmet restaurant. The Japanese and Mediterranean were good and the mexican had a lovely starter buffet but we were disappointed with the main courses. The main buffet was very good, with a different theme every night, there was so much choice it was difficult to know what to try, it's a great way to eat things that you have never had before. The pool buffet was great for lunch, plenty of choice and extremely fresh, the staff continually replenish the food so that none of it goes bad. The best part of this holiday was the the staff, they work so hard but are always smiling and happy and couldn't do enough for us, a smile and a few words in Spanish to them went a long way. My son who is 12 did feel that there wasn't much for him to do, too old for the kids club and too young for the night life!! but he made loads of fantastic friends from all over the world, France, Germany, America to name but a few and they just all hung out together and had a lot of fun, especially in the pool, where the star friends organised activities for them during the day. The pool was lovely, very refreshing in the heat, we never had problems getting sun loungers, even on the beach, we went at different times of the day and always managed to get one. My husband went diving a lot with dressel divers, who are based in the resort and for the most part really enjoyed the dives. We had no major health problems, my husband and I had slightly upset stomachs for a couple of days, but this was just due to a change in food, nothing to do with the quality of the food and my son was fine the whole holiday, he was eating lobster, prawns, burgers, chicken, sushi, you name it he tried it. I can't say enough about this resort, it really is a wonderful place to stay and we have been to many different places on holiday, including the caribbean and America many times and we all thought that this was our best holiday ever. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and hope to go back again, which is something that we have never done before.

<Content>Service - Not Eager to Please unless tipped! My family of six just came back from Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana!The resort grounds are beautiful! There was construction going onin some of the apartments and they checked us in right next to aconstruction site!!! Jack hammers, sledge hammers, the whole bit!The room smelled like Mildew, I complained and they changed theair conditioning vent which helped. The food is average....the buffetis the best place to eat....I was not happy about the sanitary conditionsof the displays of food. The cheese platters are not on ice and thecheese is sweaty! The jars of Nutella had everyone scooping out ofthem and then I saw someone push the chocolate off the spoon withhis finger and put the spoon back in the jar!! UGH! There was notmuch for my 12 yr old to do at all and the pool is not available after6:30 PM! No towels after that time also! The older kids 17-22met friends and drank themselves into oblivion every nite!!!! Theentertainment was terrible...only one out of the 8 nites was good!The only way the staff was eager to please was if they were tipped!There was also some theft...friends had their video camera stolen,money from safe and birth certificates at the airport taken fromMale Travelers. They even took our American Reef Flip Flops!Most poeple I spoke with said they would not go back!!! Veryfew Americans there also, mostly Europeans.

<Content>mixed emotions GOOD - lovely well kept grounds; beautiful well kept beaches with no rocks, coral or sea shells to hurt your feet on the beach or getting into the ocean; warm clear water in ocean; modern rooms; most service great; variety of food in buffet restaurant; excellent steaks in Steak Rest and excellent food in Jap. Rest.; No one got sick; beach facilities - lounges and cabanas; pool maintained well and water warm with bar.BAD - hamburgers are awful (made from mystery meat), beef tough in Buffet Rest. electronic room locks fail; room A/c not very good. treadmills didn't work in spa. food not good in American Rest nor Mediterrean Rest.UGLY - no A/c in gourmet restaurants - you will sweat while you eat and these restaurants are not open for a breeze; locked out of room one night from 11 pm to 1 am as night staff couldn't fix lock - finally broke open the door.MISC - be prepared for topless beach; rum seemed weak that was used to make mixed drinks. But drinks were tasty. Beer OK. go early to beach to save lounges; GET RESERVATIONS EARLY FOR ALL DAYS IN THE SPECIALTY RESTAURANTS

<Content>Nice Family Vacation We booked our annual family vacation through Apple Vacations again this year (last year was Mexico) and they continue to deliver efficient value for your money. The USA3000 flight was fine and the transportation from the airport was cool and safe. Our trip was taken between 8/10 and 8/17.The resort itself is beautiful - the people there work incredibly hard to keep the property well maintained. You really won't go more than 5 minutes without seeing someone working on the landscaping, cleaning something up or taking care of the wildlife. There are many improvements underway at the resort (painting, new landscaping, walkway repairs and building renovations) but they were never distracting and it made us feel good that they were putting effort and money into keeping the resort beautiful.Our room was big enough to fit a family of 5 comfortably (kids 11, 8 and 8). It was clean, comfortable and well maintained by the maid service. Our bar, towels and bedding were always as we asked. Our room was 2695 and was located in a quiet section of the resort midway between the pool and lobby and close to the next Iberostar resort. We had approx a 5 minute walk in one direction or another to the pool or buffet.The beach was beautiful - huge stretch of nice sand and water was mostly free of ocean grass. There were many chairs and huts to be had on the beach regardless of the time of day. We walked down the beach to the little 'mall' and it was not our scene - the 'sales' people seemed nice but were too aggressive. We looked at some of the other resorts down the beach and they seemed to be a little more upscale than the Iberostar.The pool was large and would have been nicer had they kept it a little cleaner. It wasn't dirty in a disgusting way - just too much beach sand and leaves from trees that should have been cleaned daily. The pool area is nice with chairs always available but if you want shade you need to get up and out by 8:00am. The pool bar usually only had one bartender so it was usually a small wait to get a drink.Overall the food was good. The buffets had sufficient variety and good quality of food. The main buffet is better than the snack buffet by the pool. We usually ate lunch at the snack buffet because they didn't care if you were coming from the pool. The main buffet always had hot and cold food, pasta station, grill station, carved meats and did speciality nights. The service in the buffets was spotty - we usually served ourselves are own drinks - we found one good set of servers who took care of us in the main buffet and we tried to sit by them every meal as we knew they would get our drinks and clean our plates. We tried 3 of the speciality restaurants - the japenese was the best, followed by the mexican and then the steak house. There are plenty of activities going on around the resort - my family did the ceramics (for a fee) and participated in sports and games. I think resorts fun team did a good job of getting people involved and I know we had fun in the things we participated in. The 'crazy games' are alot of fun to watch.The shows at night are heavily dependent on audience particpation - if they pick good people to be in the show they are very funny. The entertainment team works hard but talent is so-so - the best part of every show was Domingo - a talented and funny guy who was real nice to my kids.The service across the resort was uneven - some people were very nice and some were almost oblivious that we were there. This was a bit frustrating as I tipped everywhere we went. This was a very different situation than what we experienced in Mexico where everyone went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. The resort was probably 80% european and 20% american when we were there - we got the feeling that the staff was much more comfortable with the european guests.Overall it is a good resort for a family to go to - the grounds and beach are beautiful, the weather is fantastic, the activities are fun, the food and drink are good - however it is not a 6 apple resort .

<Content>fab, lovely, cool, brillant! What a great place, the beach is out of this world, the sea was beautiful clear few waves. The staff always say hello, even 2am on way back from disco, so friendly, smiling, singing, dancing while serving you. The food was excellent, if you cant find any thing to eat there you are sad, we ate in the fish resturant twice, really good, but diffacult for us to book to many resturants as their was 17 of us, including 4 childran so buffet is better for them any way. Getting a table in the buffet was not a problem, we told them in the morning about what time we would come for dinner it worked most nights, only 2 were the table had been used by some one else first, but they sorted it out as quickly as they could, no problem. Nice mixture of nationalitys, U.S.A, DUTCH, GERMAN, PERU, ENGLISH plus other europeans.The ladies from the U.S.A seem to have a problem with europeans going topless, but some of them wore g- strings so small you might as well have not botherd, and had periced nipples and tattos and when you think, we were watching U.S t.v with adverts for viagra, and when most of the worlds prono films are made there is seems very backward to be so upset by a pair of boobs! The grounds are laid out so well, with birds every where, peacocks, flamigos, and more. The rooms were fine big nice and clean no bugs, maid sevice was good they leave more water if you ask for it.We all speak a little spainish as we have all holidayed there many times, this helps a bit but they all really try to help you even if you cant make yourself understood.Our boys went of site to play golf, which was very expensive but lovely.We went Manti Park and swam with the dolphins, you dont get long but it was lovely, we had a guide for our group, which was good, but everything is a money spinner, take more money then you think, drinks they took our water of us on arrival, food, pictures, pictures, and more pictures, but they are a good reminder of your day, and how often are you going to swim with dolphins? but good day, and not to far from our hotel, only 15/20 mins on bus. The other trip my family did was snorkel on the reef and with the sharks, really good time only half day, saw nemo and dory fish. Entertanin ment on board was really good fun.Before we went we were all worried about being eaten alive by mosis, and took so much repellent with us, but we didnt get bitted much, no more then you do in Spain or Greece.Its not the sort of holiday were you hire a car a drive around, its very poor, and the guys have guns on the buliding sites, and walk around with huge knifes, when you go out on the tour buses they look a you funny, they could as nice as pie, but i wouldnt want to find out, they are so poor, it makes you realise how lucky we are to live were we do. One trip which goes inland takes you a school and the kids all run up to the bus begging, wanting sweets, what ever you have, pens pencils etc , one classroom, 75 pupils, one teacher. Very very poor.All in all a truley fantasitc holiday, we loved it all.Having read all the reviews on this site since we booked way back in Nov 04, I dont mean to funny, but you Americans are really a fussy bunch is you dont like this place, its got sea weed ! yeh its the sea ! It has waves ?there not waves there small, go to Cornwall in U.K then you will see waves.We will be back.

<Content>Mixed Review I recently spent 4 days at the Iberstar Bavaro with my wife and am offering the following information for those considering a vacation here.Apple Vacations had a very organized itinerary, with the possible exception of the arrival time, which helped us get from our departure city (Pittsburgh, PA) to the resort. The air carrier (USA 3000) offered comfortable seating and good service. The bus ride from the airport to the resort was very interesting and gave us a quick view of how impoverished most of the people are there. We arrived at the hotel around 12:30 pm and could not check into our room until about 2:30 pm which was frustrating after a long flight and considering the hot humid temperatures. The hotel lobby and main dining areas are open air. Our Jr suite was very comfortable with a large bathroom and good AC. We requested additional towels and bottled water from our maid which we tipped a couple of dollars each day. The staff was very friendly and helpful although we had difficulty at times communicating due our limited Spanish vocabulary. The grounds are gorgeous and well maintained. It would have been nice if the sidewalks were given names since they all look the same. It took us a day to get our bearings. We enjoyed the beach more than anything else. There was a constant breeze which helped reduce the effects of the 94 degree temperatures. The water temperature was very refreshing. I would advise reserving your lounge chairs under one of the grass umbrellas early in the morning as they fill up quick. On the other hand we had no problems finding chairs around the pool at any time of the day. Use plenty of sunscreen as the sun is very hot even on persons with good base tans. My wife enjoyed the European beach atmosphere which we found very refreshing. One of my biggest complaints was the drinks. Some of the bars didn't serve the better quality liquor such as Tangeuray or Absolute. The mixers were not what I'm used too. The tonic water was flat and they didn't carry cranberry juice. The other mixers were too sweet and the bartenders didn't put enough ice in the drinks. There is plenty of food to eat and most of it very good and nicely presented. I recommend the Japanese restaurant and the Gormet restaurant. The buffets, especially the breakfast buffet, are very good with lots of selection. We both got minor bouts of dysentery but nothing that kept us from enjoying the trip. Most of the vacationers are non-american but we did make friends with 2 couples from our area which was nice. Overall I do believe the Iberostar Bavaro is probably one of the better resorts around Punta Canta. If you're considering going, brush up on some Spanish, take lots of $1 bills and bring some digestive system medications.

<Content>Great Vacation We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 7/30 -8/6/05. This is a wonderful resort! The grounds are beautiful... flowering plants, flamingos, flower boxes on each balcony, peacocks, palm trees...everything is immaculately cared for and trimmed. The beach was beautiful and there were plenty of beach chairs and thatched umbrellas for everyone. We were a family of four, with two boys aged 14 and 16, we never got to the beach or the pool before 10:30am and could always find four chairs together under an umbrella! The water is blue  clear and the sand is white and soft. This is one of the best beaches I have visited! FYI- Some women, about 10%, are topless on the beach. We did not find this to be a problem. The pool was also wonderful. It is large with a swim up bar, volleyball, water polo and basketball plus the staff is entertaining the guests daily with water aerobics, dance lessons, stretching and various pool side competions. We were always able to find 4 chairs together in the shade or under an umbrella. The other Iberostar resorts- Punta Cana and Dominican were more crowded in both their pool and beach areas. We could use the other hotel facilities and our sons met quite a few kids from England at the Dominican pool (crowded meant to them more kids to hang out with).We went sailing on the resort's little catamarans on three different days, make a reservation for the sail time at the far end of the resort beach. It was alot of fun. The snorkling and scuba lesson were fun too!It is hot in the Dominican Republic! Bring light weight clothes and 50 sunscreen. Also the resort is big and the walkways can be a little slippery. We did not have a problem with this and the walking is enjoyable because the resort itself is so pretty.The evening shows could be a little hokey and my family was divided in our reviews of them. My 14 year old and I liked them but my husband and older son did not. The staff does a great job but some of the themes are on the silly side.The casino was very fun and we all went to the disco too. The disco played alot of Latin music, no surprise there! The boys went to the disco every night from 11-12:30 and loved it, we usually went to the casino. The disco is open until 3 and I think the casino is too. The staff at this resort goes out of their way to make sure everything is perfect for you. Everyone smiles and is extremely polite! The language is Spanish but most know enough English to communicate. There are guests from all over the world. We met people from England, Germany, Austria, as well as Maryland, NY, Chicago and of course Ohio. Most of the Americans were on Apple Tours, which I would recommend for this vacation. There is an Apple Representative in the hotel daily and if for some reason you should have a problem, the Rep will take care of it. The first night we did not have a gallon of water in our bathrooms and needed additional towels. The Apple Rep had water and towels delivered to our rooms very promptly. And we never had a problem with water, sodas or towels in the room again.I took Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate but we never used them. No one in our family had any problems. Just be sure not to drink the water in the bathrooms. All water and ice served in the resort are fine. I took insulated cups but did not really need them. There were places to get drinks every where. We took money to tip but found that we did not need to tip, except for the maid - we gave her $5 the first day and $5 when we left. The rooms were large and clean. We did not see and bugs or ants in either of our rooms. The rooms are comforable with air conditioning and ceiling fans. We were never bitten by mosquitoes, we took bug spray but never used it. We had wanted ajoining rooms with our two boys and had requested such. We got rooms next to each other but without a connecting inside door- the get that type of room be sure to request connecting rooms. Food was great! We loved the main buffet for dinner and the pool buffet for lunch. The main buffet was better for breakfast, huge selection, but the pool buffet had a good breakfast too. There was a party by the pool/beach one day, Thurs, with lobster and Weds they serve lobster at the main buffet. We enjoyed the Japanese, Gourmet, Steakhouse (out door by beach) and Star Rock Cafe. The restaurants were never crowded and we could have eaten in more specialty restaurants if we had wanted. The 7 day package gives you 3 dinners at the restaurants but if you want to go more frequently just check with guest relations after 3pm. And remember you can ask for seconds on the grilled lobster tail. The men do need pants and the air conditioning feels great in these restaurants! We loved Punta Cana! Our original trip was to be to the Mayan Riviera but our hotel was damaged in Hurricane Emily, so Apple rebooked us to Punta Cana with out any penalty. This is a great vacation spot and the Iberostar Bavaro is worth every penny!

<Content>A great beach vacation Having read the reviews before my family arrived at the Iberostar, I must say I was a bit nervous about what to expect. Now that we are home I can say that some people truly are too critical of every little detail. The hotel is cleaner than any Marriot or Hilton here in the U.S., as are the grounds. The food was very good, plentiful and with enough variety to please ANYONE. The beach never felt crowded. The Dominican staff puts the employees at other island resorts to shame. They go about their jobs with a smile on their face and no attidude. Oh, and no one in our family (4people, 2 teenagers) got sick. A great resort vacation.

<Content>Fun in the sun in Punta! My husband and I (from Baltimore, MD) just came back from a week stay (7.28 to 8.5) at the Iberostar Bavaro Beach in Punta Cana (D.R.). Overall, the trip was great. We arrived to the airport in the afternoon and found one of our bags missing. The airport got it to us in 24 hours though and brought it right to our room at the room hotel.We booked through FunJet, and had no problems with their service, the transfer, or the agents. They were satisfactory to use and comparable to Apple.Room: The room was a nice suite. A sunken lower living room and a king bed. The bathroom was a good size. Rooms have an iron, hair dryer, small refrid., TV, balcony, safe (get the key before you check in). The rooms are set up on a motion detector system, so you can't keep your AC or fridge on when your are at the pool all day. Some other guests told us they hung a shirt on a hanger from the ceiling fan to keep it on all day. The only reason to really do that is to keep the fridge cold. Also, there's no clocks, but wake-up service is pretty timely. I felt a little weird without a clock, but I think it's because I'm a teacher and used to living by a clock. Maid service was awesome. We left them a couple bucks a day and always had a stocked fridge and plenty of towels. Some other people told us they got makeup and hair dothingies at the dollar store and left them for the maids. That stuff is expensive there, so they love that stuff.Food: The food was great. We ate often (for lunch) at the pool buffet and they had awesome stuff. Great chicken. We tried the Japanese restaurant, Mexican restaurant, the Medit. Restaurant, Gourmet Restaurant (lobster!), and the Steak restaurant for dinner. I thought each were equally good. But, for an American missing cold beer, the Mexican restaurant is the only place you can get all-you-can-drink Coronas. I also like the Medit. Restaurant because they had some awesome seafood appetizers. The main buffet was also great, lots of choices.Drinks: I heard a lot of people had some problems after drinking the two beers there--Presidente and Bohemian. A lot of people thought it would be safe--no water--but it ended up getting a lot of people sick. Stick to the drinks. They have more top shelf stuff if you stay at the Iberostar Bavaro and not venture over to the other hotels. Stoli and Lemonade is good choice. So, is red wine and lemonade mix--never heard of it until a Londoner told me it was good. Other drinks are OK, but I'm just not into all the sweet drinks like Pina Coladas. Wine was served with every dinner. White and red were both decent.Pools: We had no problems at all during any time of the day finding chairs. We had a group of 6 of us and we got a row of 6 at the pool bar everyday. And, I need shade--there were plenty of umbrellas to go around. When you check in, they should give you a little card for towels. You can change them a couple times a day, but if you want more than one per person you need to bring your own from home. Get the card back before you check out, they'll charge you if you don't have it.Beach: The beach was great. Not the best beach in the Carribean, but plenty of eye candy for the guys to keep them distracted. From the Iberostar, looking out at the water--go right. Many shops--argue them down! They'll follow you back up the beach so you can get money from your room if you didn't bring it with you. Lookling at the beach, go left to sign up the banana boat. It was fun, but harder to get back on when you fall off than you realize. Excursions: We did the speed boats / snorkeling. It was so fun! If you wear contacts, bring some drops or a little towel for your eyes. The snorkeling was OK, nothing too impressive compared to other snorkeling in the Carribean. We also swam with the dolphins at Manati Park. It was short, but fun. The rest of the park wasn't that great, but OK to walk around for a half an hour. Don't bring ANY jewlwelry. They have no lockers and they make you take off jewlwery so you won't scratch the dolphins. Night Life: Mangoo (sp.?) is a local place we went to with some of the bartenders (only in a group--I would not go as a woman alone!) Any bartender can tell you how to get there. It was half locals and half tourists. It was a blast. Watch out for local women asking you if, You ATM? That is definitely code for SOMETHING ELSE! The discotech at the Iberostar is hit or miss, and so is the casino. We didn't see any shows (or we just didn't really pay attention to them). The sports bar bext to the disco has good A/C and is fun. Many people at night just chill, play cards, dance, and drink.Hints: *Knowing a little Spanish (or brushing up on high school Spanish) will help a little. *They do not cater to Americans, which I love. There is not the usual obnoxious Americans everywhere. Mainly couples, groups of couples, and families travel here. Not a good spot for singles.*The staff is great, definitely above average, but not as good as you find on some of the higher-end cruise lines. *If your travel agent says there aren't many kids, don't believe him or her. There are many more kids than I thought, and there weren't any pools or bars that were adults only. We suggested that the pool bar be 14 and up to the management, but I don't think that will change any time soon.It was great fun!

<Author>MassapequaShores
<Content>Very Good Vacation Arrival: My husband and two daughters aged 21 and 25 arrived in Punta Cana on July 22 and departed July 26 via an American Airlines package from New York; the flights were wonderful. Our ride to the Iberostar using Parieto tours was a little nerve-wracking considering the fact that they have two lane, bumpy roads and the driver tried numerous times to pass trucks and cars in front of us and didn't allow enough room between cars. However, we had a better ride back to the airport, because we had a good driver.Check In: Check in was a breeze with very friendly people. Our mission the first day was to make dinner reservations for four nights. We had to wait until 3 o'clock when Guest Services opened -- we went earlier and avoided a line.Food: Although many gave the Japanese Restaurant a good review, my husband and I picked something we didn't like -- our daughters were fine with theirs. The Steak House was very good -- we had rib eye; the restaurant is not air-conditioned. The Gourmet was excellent --- shrimp appetizer, large sized lobster tail and delicious vegetables. Our daughters do not eat fish, and a very helpful Guest Service employee told us that they would order chicken for them with no problem (it was good). Note: You can ask for chicken in any restaurant if someone doesn't eat fish. We also ate at the Star Rock Cafe in the other building (it's air conditioned) and it was really good. My husband and I had the beef short ribs -- good choice. You'll see pictures of the Beatles and Elvis, just like the Hard Rock Cafe. On our last day they had a barbeque by the pool with music, singing, dancing, and sangria. They served, shrimp, beef, pork and something else on skewers --very good. Pool: Many people put towels, etc. on chairs to reserve them -- very early in the morning although there are signs under the huts saying it is prohibited to reserve chairs. What I noticed on my last day was that people turn their towels in at the end of the day and ask for new ones, then put them on the chairs the following morning. I was at the pool at 7:45 a.m. -- the towel hut was not opened, so I put my own towels, books, etc. to reserve our chairs. They have scuba lessons in the pool, exercises for a half hour, water volley ball and plenty of other things and excursions. We didn't go on any excursions. You can purchase rafts and flotation devices in the gift shop, which we did.Beach: The sand is wonderful and not hot at all! There are plenty of huts and chairs. My husband and one daughter went on the banana ride and had fun although my husband said his shoulders were sore considering he was tossed off 2-3 times and had to get back on, which can be quite a feat.Tipping: We brought $200 in singles and used about $125. You don't have to tip, but being New Yorker's, we felt obliged to tip the bartenders $2-3 after a couple of drinks or if someone went out of their way for us. We tipped the maid $5 the first day ($5 for both rooms) and then $2 a day per room after that. One day we returned to our room and found the mini bar open and not restocked -- we called and they came quickly. We asked for four towels per day and they accommodated us.Room: The rooms were very nice -- there is a balcony where you can place your bathing suits out to dry. Our daughters' room definitely smelled musty and I would suggest you bring a scented candle or baking soda to absorb the smell. Our room didn't smell musty, but when we got home, all of our clothes absorbed a musty smell -- I have one of those noses that detect all smells -- some people may not be bothered by it.Staff: The staff are very friendly, smiling, happy people. They will do anything to go out of their way for you. Entertainment: Every night they put on a show and they do a good job. What to wear: Bring rubber soled sandles that are comfortable and supportive. The walk from the pool to the rooms and lobby can be quite far depending on where you're located. The walk ways have paving stones that are uneven (not flat) and can be very slippery if you're wet. I almost slipped a couple of times, even in my sandles, which were not rubber soled.Note: Men must wear long pants in the speciality restaurants.Flea Market on the Beach: My husband and I wanted to bring back a large bottle of vanilla and rum for our friends. We paid $10 dollars for the vanilla only to find out that the Gift Shop sold it for $2 dollars! I suggest you buy souvenirs from any one of the three gift shops -- the Dominica is the largest, not from the flea markets. We also found some of the vendors to be very pushy, which we didn't like, but you might just find it interesting to take a walk.Bugs: There are microscopic ants all around, however, we didn't see any in our rooms -- our daugher's did. Don't put your bags on the floor if possible and you won't have any problems. One of our daughters got bit by mosquitos the night we were in the Steak House, but they didn't go near me and I'm always their best target.Sunscreen: I'm very fair and put on 50 every day; came home with a tan and no sunburn. Overall, we were very pleased with the resort -- my husband didn't want to leave.

<Content>Just returned, Good Place, Great People, Read On..... Ola, Everyone. Just returned from a week stay with my husband and 2 kids (ages 7  4). I will start at the top. Left on a 6am flight (Right on time) thru Apple on USA 3000, great flight, free headphones  movie  breakfast, decent choices. Good flight, arrived early into P.C., off to the Terminal, (hahahaha,) took a photo with 2 women in traditional DR clothing (you will see it and have a chance to buy upon return flight back home). Got the bags and off to the Apple Rep. kind, friendly and helpful. We got stuck in a lot of traffic going to the resort, due to a taxi strike along the only road to get there. Nonetheless, after an hour and a half we made it! Checked in, greeted with drinks, went to the buffet for lunch. We checked into the room around 1:30, changed and headed to the pool for about 30 minutes. Big thunderstorm rolled in, rained for about 20 min. and remained cloudy for the rest of the day. No big deal, just enjoyed getting a feel for the place. Around 3pm, went to the lobby to make reservations for the restaurants. Tried 5 of the 9 they offered. They do NOT limit how many reservations you can make, which was a nice surprise, because I read that they do limit them. So here's the breakdown on the restaurants, went to the steakhouse for the first night, great ribeye  sirloin, the steakhouse is at the pool, so it is not air conditioned. Next night onto the gourmet, (lobster for entree) pretty good, except they only give a 1/2 of a tail per person, asked for seconds, and no problem, brought out another 1/2 each.We ate at the seafood restaurant, average, Japanese (better) and lastly at the Mexican (don't bother). The first and last night we ate at the buffets and so many people wrote to eat at them, but I decided I wanted to be served for dinner, did enough dining at the buffets for breakfast and lunch. I will say that the selections at the dinner buffets were excellent. Many entrees to choose from. Anyone, can find a delicous meal. I would only recommend the Steakhouse, the Gourmet (La Ballena) and the Japanese as a must try. The rest of the meals, just go to the buffet. Heed the advice, I wish I had.The beach is beautiful, kept clean and there are plenty of seats and palapas. The pool is Ok, but just ok, it is very slippery and we watched our kids and many others going in and out and land on their duffs. Very dangerous, so take it slow! They do allow rafts, so either bring one with you or you can buy them at the lobby store for about $7 U.S. If you do not get to the pool to reserve some space, you are out of luck, and I mean good luck. They definately need more seating, it looks like a lot, but it fills up fast! By day 3, we went down to the pool to reserve seating, left some stuff on the chairs and headed back up to the main lobby for breakfast. At poolside, they have a ceramic painting studio, where you can pick a piece to paint and bring back. I thought they were kinda pricey, $12-$30 a piece. It starts getting expensive when the kids just want to paint everyday, although it makes a nice momento to bring home.We did go shopping down to the right of the beach, met some nice people from the DR, and brought back the typical souvenirs. We stopped at the snack shack on the beach at The Ibero property and the kids enjoyed a cold soda with a Hot Dog  FF. Very nice staff there.For nightlife, we did watch the shows, and I will have to say they were nice. These people work 16 hours a day, and sweat their tails off, and get up on a stage at night under the lights and really do their best to entertain you! Big applause to them. The casino (aka...donation center and nasty dealers) watch your cards, I had 21 and the dealer argued with me and tried to take my $$$. I said, oh no, count the cards again doll and she did (reluctantly) and realized I was right. Well after that, she wasn't too happy with me and the cards I got were only to benefit her, so we left and moved back to the main hotel. So much for gambling!So bottom line of the resort is this..... I do not feel this hotel was a 6 Golden Apple, Maybe a 5 Red, but it's just my opinion. Not the greatest of resorts, I think the Melia Caribe was better, but everyone has their own mind to make up. The property is kept clean, the staff overall are very friendly and kind and the rooms were definately adequate for the 4 of us to share. (By the way, the kids slept on the 2 couches which covert to a twin mattress wnen you take off the cushions, and it was perfect for them.) Hubby and I shared a king bed. Just the way to go for a family of 4.The food and drinks were fair, but edible. (just a bit repetitive after 8 days) We did not get sick, just a little girguly, nothing Imodium coudln't handle, and all was well.I personally, would not stay at this property again, but WOULD without a doubt return to the Dominican Republic. If you are going, have a wonderful time, and remember to keep everything in perspective. Everything in life has some good and some bad. It's vacation, and that's what is important!!! Have a safe and nice trip. Adios!

<Content>Best Vacation Ever We have just returned from a wonderful week at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana (7/09/2005- 7/16/205). This was our first time at this Resort, but not our first time at Punta Cana, since we usually go back every year. We love the climate, the beaches, the landscaping and specially its people which are the most friendly in the caribbean. Let me emphazized that we have never had a problem with the drinking water, and never gotten sick. This was our 8 trip to Punta CanaThis time there were 5 of us My husband, daughter, niece, my mother and myself, we book 2 jr suites which were perfectly locarted closed to the pool area and the beach.The hotel Lobby, its decors and surroundingsincluding the gardens are beautiful, and I have to say that I never saw any roosters, what you do see a lot are peakcoks and they are beautiful birdsService at the pool area was excellent, and the poool animation team did a good job everyday.Breakfast, lunch and dinner were excellent, as soon as we arrived I made the reservations to the restaurant. The Japanese Rest was excellent we ate there twice, and service was top of the line, same at La Dorada Rest.

<Content>Had a great time at the Iberostar Bavaro Just returned from a stay at the Iberostar Bavaro with my wife and I would say that we had a great time. We are 34 and 33 years old and celebrating our 5 year anniversary and stayed from 7/13 - 7/17.The trip down... We booked our vacation through American Airlines vacations so we did not have a direct flight. We flew into San Juan, PR and took a puddle jumper to Punta Cana from there. Flight was smooth with the exception of my wife being a little nervous on the smaller plane, but it was fine. Arrived at the airport and paid our 10 dollars a piece filled out our cards, got our bags and were on our way. Our transfer was through Prieto tours and the lead guy told us to go with another guy to a van. We were on a cramped van with 3 other couples with a driver that spoke zero English. We stopped at a local establishment to get some drinks and were on our way. The roads in this country are terrible and the drivers are even worse. I would say we were in near miss accidents at least six times. Then I knew I was in trouble after 1 hour and 15 minutes we pulled into Secrets Resort. The other 3 couples were staying there and we were not, the driver thought we were. After much confusion we got back in the van and headed another 40 minutes back to the Iberstar Bavaro. Not a very good start to the vacation.The Hotel... When we finally got there our check in went very smooth. The lobby is very beautiful along with all of the grounds on the property. They spend a lot of time and effort maintaining the grounds and it shows. We stayed in room 2581 which was 5 units off of the main walkway close to the Lobby, but pretty far from the beach and pool. We had a king size bed, and the room was very clean and had no funky smells as reported in other reviews. AC worked great and we were very satisfied with our room.The Service... I can not understand how people could not be satisfied with the service at this resort. Just about everyone that worked there went out of their way to make us happy. At first our room keys would not work, maid let us in to use phone to call front desk, new keys delivered in 10 minutes. We left 2 dollars a day for the maids and some small gifts and our room was spotless, fridge stocked, and fresh flowers with towels in the shapes of swans everyday. The bartenders and waitressed were all very nice and willing to serve with a smile on their face. Franklin at the Lobby Bar was our favorite but they were all great. The one exception to this rule were the dealers in the casino, all female, and all very unfriendly. I do not know why, it was weird, as if they were instructed to be that way. Also, be prepared for some language barriers. Most do not speak much English with the exception of the front desk people. I did not see this and being bad, it was actually kind of fun to try to speak Spanish with them and again they all tried very hard to keep everyone happy.The food... I was very afraid of the food situation from some of the reviews that I read but was actually pleasantly surprised. The buffet had numerous choices and breakfast and dinner were excellent. Lunch was not as good but still ok. The beach barbeque lunch was excellent, more seafood than you can imagine. We ate at the Japanese restaurant. I enjoyed it, my wife did not, personal taste i guess. My wife did get sick to her stomach the last day. Not sure if it was something she ate or just the accumulation of 4 days of eating and drinking non stop. The beach and pool... They were absolutely beautiful. The pool was huge with a really cool shaded swim up bar but it was difficult to get chairs by the pool unless you got up early. The beach was great and not too hot due to constant breeze coming off of the ocean. There were some topless women but not too many. Much easier to get a chair with a hut on the beach. No problem getting beach towels but they did run out late in the afternoon.The Casino... Very small, but it was air conditioned. 5 Black Jack tables, 2 Roulette tables, 1 Carribean Stud, and 1 3 Card Poker table (always very crowded), and about 30 slot machines. I lost about 200 dollars and like I said the dealers were very rude and did make a few mistakes. I did meet a lot of fun people there though. (Hello Crazy Patty and the gang from Cleveland)The Disco... Went for about 5 minutes, very hot, very smokey, and very crowded. Not my cup of tea anymore (I am 34) but if you were in your late teens or early 20's it would probably be very fun. The negatives... I know this is going to sound stupid and there is nothing the resort can do to fix these things but i want to mention them as a point of interest to people thinking of vacationing here. It is very hot, I know it is the Caribbean and it is supposed to be but even at night I sweat my butt off. All of the night time activities are far from the beach in the lobby and there is no breeze at all. Also this a big resort and expect to do a lot of walking. They do have shuttles from the Lobby to the Dominicana hotel next door to ease some of that. All in all it was a wonderful vacation and I would definately recommend this resort to anyone.

<Content>It was GREAT My husband and I visited the Iberostar Bavaro July 2 - 8. It was our first trip to the Dominican Republic, our third stay at an Iberostar resort. We booked our trip with Apple vacations. Our flight was with USA3000 and was the best Charter experience yet. We left on time, had a friendly crew and arrived safely. They showed a movie (Hitch) and provided a meal during our 4 hour flight. As we all know, one of the more frustrating parts of flying is the waiting for everyone infront of you to get their carryon luggage out of the overhead compartment and exit (why does it seem to take so long, argggh!) We were seated in the back of the plane and just as our legs were having enough of the cramped space, they opened the BACK door and we were free! Once in the Punta Cana airport we stepped in the line that was formed, where we waited to have our picture taken with 2 girls dressed in festive clothing (the picture will be waiting for you as you leave). Then it was off to the counter where you are charged $10 a piece to fill out a form with the smallest print possible and then to customs. Frankly, it was a quick and smooth process. We had a bit of trouble finding our luggage as the pieces were seperated and one piece ended up on the carousel of a different flight. There are only 2 carousels, so don't get too worried :) We bypassed the luggage guys - as we read on here that the walk is short to the buses. The Apple reps were easy to find and are spread out along the path to the bus.Our transportation to the hotel was at 9:00pm - we did not see a lot of the 'landscaping' of town but there were a lot of people out and they seemed like they were having a good time. They ride numerous people on 1 motorcycle and sorta on the road/shoulder next to the buses. The roads are bumpy and narrow. I guess initially you might think it looks like the ghetto/hood, but frankly it is just they way they live. Everything is the same - nothing highclass until you hit the resort area. We arrived safely to the hotel and checked in with no problems. While at the front desk we were brought Bahama Mama drinks and then given a brief orientation. We did not have to pay for our safe. The staff are very friendly and you can tell they want you to have a worry-free stay! We had a short walk to our room. The layout of the grounds is very easy to navigate - even in the dark. Our room was nice. No complaints about the air conditioner, refrigerator (or it's stock), the view, etc. We had a little 1 1/2 inch silverfish-like bug on our wall when we arrived. The bellman who brought our luggage got him for me and gave me an extra assurance there is nothing poisonous in the D.R. I never saw another bug and the first one really didn't bother me that bad, I just prefered him gone :)The next day we went to the gym - it overlooks the ocean and is open air. They have free weights, some weight machines, about 4 stationary bikes, 3 treadmills (but only one worked by day 3). They have cold bottled water there, so you don't need to bring any from the room. It was crowded every day (we were there early when they opened).Now on to the important stuff - the food, LOL (why do you think we work out, LOL). The buffet is decent. For breakfast, if you go to the back buffet, there is a guy who makes the greatest french toast and is thrilled to do it! There is also a little gal who makes very good omlets at the first buffet; she has to be burning up hot, but just sings and smiles all the time! For lunch we found the pool area to have more American style food. There were two days they had little parties to introduce some of the dominican culture. One day was Sangria and Paella - YUMMY! Dinner - We ate at the Gourmet, Mexican, Japanese, Steak, and Mediterranean resturants. We liked the Gourmet the best - the menu is fixed and the main dish is grilled lobster! The Mexican (where you choose your main course) was our second favorite. Our service at the Japanese wasn't great but the food was good! We had very very slow service - but in their defense they had 2 very large groups that seemed to throw them off a bit. When you get there you can make 3 reservations, and then at 3pm (do not wait) daily you can go to reservation desk and check for cancellations. So if you really like a resturant, you could go every night if there are cancellations. I will also note that while the resturants are air conditioned, they are still kinda warm. We ate at the buffet (open air, not bad in the evening) a couple of nights - and it's a buffet that feeds people from all over the world - so it has some varied stuff. It was fun to try stuff you don't regularly eat, but if you aren't like that you will still find plenty to eat. We ordered room service once - not a lot of choice - but it was timely and good.I mentioned before that this is the third Iberostar we have stayed at. So, we didn't work too hard to see the shows as they seemed the same as the ones in Mexico. They aren't bad - but we prefered to walk on the beach. Speaking of...the beach is beautiful! The water is warm, the waves are calm, the sand is soft, the seaweed is not bad and cleaned up every am. We had no problem finding chairs or palapua's. It also seemed the beach cleared out by around 2. We saw some topless women - so be aware if that bothers you. On the flip side - if you are looking forward to it, you will be disappointed - it's not the hotties that are topless, LOL! The beach has little crabs that scurry around at night - they are fun!We did 2 excursions - the aquatic tour, you get in 2 person speedboats and cruise through the ocean, stop and snorkel a bit (feed fish) and then cruise back. It's a 1/2 day and was GREAT fun. We also took the safari tour. That was a whole day and worth it! You get lunch and baptized drinks ;), and boogie board at the end (can you believe it, we were boogie boarding while H. Dennis was hitting Haiti, and we had no waves to speak of!)Our return flight was delayed 1:45 hours (extra beach time complients of the weather back home). We gave our luggage to the bellboy and they locked our carryon in a room. We showered and changed in the area they provide in lobby! (BTW - that bathroom and the one by the Gourmet resturant are the most air conditioned) The wait in the air port was longer than I would have liked, but that is how they schedule things! Our return flight was as smooth as the first. We saw the movie Fever Pitch - and had dinner - on a 10:20pm flight home, LOL! Most amazing was how smooth customs was at home (our last US customs experience almost resulted in...well a different story and not related to the D.R.). We did, however, still have the experience of the dreaded WHY DOES IT TAKE YOU SO LONG TO GET YOUR STUFF OUT OF THE OVERHEAD COMPARTMENT and at 1am - well...people move slower than you would think, LOL.So, here is some other helpful stuff that we hadn't read before we went...we hear your cell phone will work there, but to call America is cheaper from the hotel than on your phone. Our Apple rep. advised against using a calling card or credit card - he claims it is more expensive than direct calling. We called home twice - no problems. When you are in the Punta Cana airport on your return day they will check your bags, not your carry-on. They will take your hairspray and batteries - or at least they are supposed to. Some of us kept our hairspray - others lost it. We were told and read that the people are hard to communicate with. We did not find that. What we did find is that they are some of the friendliest poeple we have found - singing, dancing, happy! If you've been to mexico - the language barrier is not any different. The only other thing I will add is that this is rated a 6 golden apple, and it is very nice. BUT, if you have been to the Iberostar Lindo - it is not the same. We had a great time, we were celebrating our 10th anniversary - they treated us with surprises a couple of days. We would definately go back and have no complaints. Feel free to email me with any questions and enjoy your trip and for goodness sake, try the mamajuana - you are on vacation afterall;)

<Content>Freezing swimming pool, great ocean  While the rooms were lovely, large and VERY nice with lovely individual porches and clean bathrooms, nice sitting areas etc, and the beach was FABULOUS WITH PERFECT OCEAN TEMPERATURES, the food was copious but very ordinary and the swimming pool was too cold to swim in. The hot tubs were usually either broken or being fixed. Check those aspects ahead of time if they are important to you. The staff are wonderful, and the grounds are excellent.

<Content>Paradise in DR My husband and I were at the Iberostar Bavaro 6/26-7/2, we went for a long a waited vacation and to have our wedding ceremony (we did the legal paper work in the US because it is an act of congress to get married in the Dominican). Everything was beautiful! From the flowers that the resort provided (for a fee of course) to the setting to the photos that were taken. I had no complaints at all (contact Christine if you are thinking about getting married or renewing your vows she was great to deal with).The resort itself is miles of lush flowers and shrubs with grass that looks like it belongs on a golf green. The stamped concrete walkways are cleaned daily (no peacock poop anywhere). The palm trees are huge (some even grow up through the buildings) and we saw the grounds workers climbing them to cut the coconuts down and pruning the branches. The pool and the swim up bar are over run with kids so we hung out more on the beach (yes some of the women are topless). There is a great little bar hut if you go to your right on the beach which had hotdogs, grilled cheese and fries and of course the booze! Lenardo is a great bar tender that always has a smile on his face and is constantly checking with you to see if you need a refill. If your a Red Sox fan he will love you. I wish I would have brought some of the Red Sox cups that Dunkin Doughnuts was giving out, he would have thought that was great.The beach was absolutly beautiful. White sand that felt like powder and it did not heat up like in Maine and the water is so warm (bring some Visine with you, the salt water got to my eyes and I wish I had some). There was very little seaweed on the beach and none in the water. You could see where the grounds workers had raked it up that morning. We were always able to get lounge chairs and we did not get down to the beach until about 12:00 everyday. Get a chair by Lenardo's bar and you will have everything you need all afternoon.Our room was perfect for what you needed. The a/c worked very well and the fan above the bed was great. We tipped our maid everyday $2.00 and she made sure we had extra towels, fresh flowers and all the beer and water we wanted everyday (the beer and water are warm when they drop it off, but by the time you get off the beach to get ready for dinner it is cold). They only change the bedding every other day so do not put your sandy feet in the bed or you will pay for it (After the first time I made sure that I wiped my feet off every time I got in bed). The porch was nice, we saw some tiny lizards out there. The only problem was that is where the ant's were. Never saw any in the room.The food was way better than I ever could have expected. Don't worry about it sitting out in the heat, there are so many people eating at the buffet by the lobby that the food is turned over multiple times per meal. We even saw them take away cakes that were only half eaten because they no longer looked pretty (because of people serving themselves other peices had fallen over) and replaced it with a new one. My husband and I are both very careful about the food that we eat due to safety reasons and we both ate anything we wanted with no hesitation. This place gave a whole new meaning to buffet for me. All meals, breakfast through dinner were fantastic, I have never seen so many choices. Just a little tip, sit next to the first buffet. The tables towards the pond have the best waiters in the whole place. We also ate at the steak house which was good and the gourmet restaurant (everyone who was with us, three other adults, thought it was good but I'm not into rock lobster).The night show are a must see. They are very entertaining and I have never seen a group of people who try so hard to make everyone happy. You will also see them during the day on the beach and by the pool. Say hello to James Bond 007 for us. You'll know it is him when you see him, he will walk up to you and say  I know who you are and then call you by some superstars name.We took two side trips. The first was Jurassic Park Safari ($78.00 each all day), this is a must do if you have any interest at all in how the dominicans really live. Our tour guide Roberto knew at least 5 different languages and was very informative. They broke out the rum and Presidente at about 9:15 in the morning so be sure you eat a good breakfast before you go on this trip. Junior was our driver, this man knew at all times where his wheels were and did everrything possible to avoid the car size pot holes that were everywhere. We went horseback riding, to a cigar shop, lunch at their animal park, a cock fight (with rubber balls not spurs and not to the death) and ended the day at Maceo Beach to do some boogy boarding. Tip, this is the best place to buy jewelery from the vender that is on the beach. He will give you the best deal out of anyone you will see before or after.We also went on a beach horseback riding side trip ($50.00 each 2 hr. ride) which was also very fun. We got to run the horses down the beach and then they brought us to a coconut grove where they climbed the trees and cut down coconuts for us to drink the milk (by the way coconut milk is a natural laxative). My husband had only been on a horse once before (the other day at the other side trip) and thought it was wonderful. I can not say enough about the people who work on this resort. They are always in a good mood, very friendly and try so hard to understand and communicate with those of us who speak very little spanish. We brought $100.00 in $1 bills and used them all. All money goes a long way with these people and they deserve it and are very thankful for it. This was a wonderful vacation/honeymoon. Scott and I were able to connect in ways that we never had. I would reccomend this resort to anyone with no hesitation and can not wait to go back (hopefully in Nov. 05).

<Content>Truly superb resort experience Book it now! My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at Bavaro Iberostar in early June. Our suite was spotless, spacious, and surprisingly cool during the hot summer.The buffet was always delicious with freshly baked breads, local fruits, and an assortment of entrees to suite any taste. Don't miss the beachside paella!Knowing about noisy peacocks, we took earplugs to ensure that our sweet dreams lasted until mid-morning. First sound, put them in and snore some more. We live on a Caribbean island filled with roosters.No mosquitoes or bugs like in Puerto Rico this time of year.We will recommend IB to our best friends and visit again ourselves. Words can't describe our incredible stay.

<Content>Great family vacation on a beach We found this site very helpful for when planning our trip to Punta Cana, so I felt it compelled to posting a review. Airline/TransportationWe booked our trip thru Funjet. On June 19th, we landed in Punta Cana earlier than our expected arrival time. Be aware that the locals will be pushing for money as soon as you are thru customs (in restrooms even). And, don't let the white shirted men fool you into believing they are a part of Funjet to help with your bags. They are not and you don't have to move your bags very far. A bus took us on a 45 minute drive from the airport to the resort. No problems with the bus - it was in good shape. I had heard bad things about the buses from previous postings, so I was nervous about that. The only negative part about our trip was the return flight home -- but keep in mind -- this is only the negative part. We arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure time, to find out a plane was not available. Funjet transported us to the Occidental Allegro Resort to spend a few hours (this resort and beach is no where near as nice as the Bavaro). Fighting for a spot on the bus to take us to the Allegro was terrible. They had to take everyone in three busses that arrived at different times. You fought to get your bags on the bus first and to find a seat. After the 2 hours at the Allegro they shipped us back to the airport to learn that our flight was delayed again. We sat at the airport for over 4 hours and finally left 7 hours after our scheduled departure. This was an entire wasted day. They did show two movies on the flight to and from Chicago, which was nice.ResortThe Iberostar Resort is beautiful and the people are very nice. The Bavaro had a terrific room held for us that overlooked the pool and beach. It was also very close to the restaurants. We did a lot of the daytime events -- bocci ball, mini golf, archory, etc. The walk between the three resorts is not far at all and, if you want, you can have the bellboys drive you to the other resorts. Because the main pool area at the Bavaro was being renovated a couple days after our arrival, we spend a couple days at the Dominicana pool. We found this pool to be more enjoyable anyway. The beach at the Bavaro is much better -- not as crowded and we didn't have any problems finding chairs anywhere on the resort. The snorkling is fantastic off of the beach at the Bavaro. My husband went scuba diving and said he saw more fish off of the beach. We took our own snorkling gear, but they did have gear there for you to use. The sand on the beach was very soft -- not many seashells. Restaurants/BarsThe food was okay, but I'm a picky eater. It seemed like they had the same thing every night. Since we stayed 7 nights, we were to have 3 nights at the sit down restaruants, but they gave us four. I was worried about the buffet restaurants, because none of them are air-conditioned. Made me wonder how fast the food spoiled. We really liked the Star Rock restaurant. For the sit down restaurants, we enjoyed the Mexican Restaurant the best. The restaurants by the pool areas were the best for breakfast and lunch. My husband did end up catching some type of bug, but he ate many new things that he's not used to. My daughter and I didn't have any problems at all. All of us took Pepto as a precaution everyday. For the bars, we were impressed that they had liquor, such as Baileys and JB. You just need to ask for them. They had an area that introduced blended drinks nightly. We had no problems getting the reservations we wanted, but we did book them the day we arrived. Dress cool. Even though the sit down restaurants are air conditioned, they were still very warm. MosquitosWanted to make sure I got this in, because we were worried. We so absolutely no mosquitos and didn't use the bug spray once. ExcursionsWe only left the resort once to go eat at Captain Cooks for lunch. They picked us up right on the beach at the Bavaro and we took a small boat to the restaurant. The food here was great. Huge platter of seafood that included lobster, conch, crab, shrimp, etc. I say there were about 7 lobster tails per person and it was all you can eat! Only downside is that you get all you can drink as well, but they only had cerveza, sangria, water or coca cola. I go more for the fruity drinks. There were locals begging for money while you ate, which kind of turned me off as well. But, I would recommend this place if you like seafood. What to takeI suggest taking some mugs to keep your drinks cool as well as rafts. We had no problems getting fresh towels. We didn't use much money at the resorts; although, we did take a bunch of ones for the tips. We left a tip for our maid daily and she took very good care of us by leaving plenty of water, towels and by restocking our fridge daily. Have Fun!We will stay at this resort again and stay in Punta Cana. Were were looking for an area that was like Beaches in Turks  Caicos. While, Turks and Caicos is still our favorite island, Punta Canas beach was pretty nice.

<Content>We Loved It!!!! Do not go by the negative reviews about this resort! It is obvious that some travelers are extremely picky on holidays and they need to relax and take it down a knotch. My boyfriend and I booked our 4 day getaway June 13-17 through apple vacation and I have to tell you the attention we received from the apple representatives Mark and Carlos was phenomenal! (couldn't ask for more)We were pretty worried b/c we were following the forecast which predicted thundershowers everyday. When we arrived at Punta Cana it was cloudy and drizzly. It rained mostly at night for the first 2 days but then it was EXTREMELY HOT and SUNNY so make sure you take 45-50 sunscreen.This resort is enormous! and if you try to walk to the other 2 properties Dominica  Punta Cana...get ready for some major exercise. The property is absolutely beautiful! Yes...it is a 10 years old resort but it is very and I mean very well kept. You will come across Flamingoes in the pond that sorround the buffet restaurant; woodpeckers, different types of birds, ducks, and different kinds of fish. Now...the resort has what you call PEACOCKS not roosters as some reviewers described them (if you're not sure what an animal is....please do not write it. Ask. It is embarrassing not knowing the difference it's like not knowing the difference between a pigeon and a chicken and then write about it). The peacocks are all around the property and they scream instead of singing at 4am and all throughtout the afternoon. This can bother some people specially if your suite is close to the lobby. The resort caters to nature and the beauty of animals and it is something you learn to appreciate when you come from a big city like NYC when all you see is rats on the subways, pigeons, dogs and cats in the park. Well...enough about this.....when we arrived to our room..we hated it b/c we had a construction view and I didn't want to see skinny, sweaty men at work. We went back to the reception desk to request another room and they hooked us up w/ a room that was close to the pool and the beach with an awesome view...(Of course we took very good care of the reception person $$$ for hooking us up) And they were constantly asking if we were ok w / the room. Bring money and tip these employees. They work hard and I'm pretty sure they're underpaid. A little gratuity here and there doesn't hurt (a couple of bucks) and we learned quickly that it can go a long way. We never had to wait for anything! The pool is nice and big! and the pool bar was great! The frozen drinks are nice and frozen not runny. The beach is beautiful....I cannot describe it- you have to experience itThe restaurants were really good. The buffet was awesome! they had a variety of foods. My favorite was the baked chicken. We didn't get a chance to try the Japanese and the Mexican b/c we were always late so we settled for buffett... we were happy!The club was fun. I liked the decor- It's a jet theme and smoky (not cigarette smoke). It was constantly crowded and lots of dancing. We walked around the other properties and tried the hot tub at the spa which is at Iberostar Dominicana...I think. It was so nice and relaxing....it definately felt like vacation. The hot tub is included!Kids...you will see lots of families and children (all tourists) it didn't bother us but we came across some people that were not happy about that...There's Secrets Resort- adults only! not too far- just felt like I had to bring it upOverall...we had a great time! The only complaint that I have is that it went by too fast! We will definately go back...right hon?In conclusion, you're going to read negative reviews about any place in the world...If Paradise is created to perfection, somebody is going to find something to complain about.Just experience it yourself, we did and we're happy we stayed at Iberostar Bavaro.

<Content>Had a wonderful time We just got back from Punta Cana and we stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana. We had a great time. The beach is clean and the water is very nice. The pool is wonderful although I recomend going down in the morning to reserve an umbrella. The landscaping is amazing. The staff is very friendly and very helpful but, they don't speak very good English. One thing that we found suprising was the European woman go topless and, believe me it wasn't just a few either. The rooms are very spacious and you really can't get a bad view. The food was average but, good enough for an all inclusive resort. The drinks were very good and there were always plenty of bar tenders. Over all I would recomend the Iberostar. Had a great time and we plan on going back soon.

<Content>Will Never Go Back! OK, we went in June with our kids...that was our mistake. The rest of this horrible vacation was thanks to this resort.Our trip took place from 06/12 to 06/18. The positives: (1) Well landscaped property with lush tropical vegetation and wildlife (mostly birds...including roosters that will wake you up EVERY morning at 5:30 am!). (2) Food was not bad but if you want to eat at their best restaurant The Gourmet, you have to reserve a table as soon as you get there or as we found out you can't get in!! (3) The kid's club did a good job entertaining our daughter and got her involved the evening productions held every night. (4) Incredible beach.The negatives: (1) The resort is 10 years old. If you're unlucky enough to get an older room, be prepared for some bad odors (bring a room freshner!) (2) This is a third world country. There is not much to do outside the resort areas as you will notice on your way here from the airport. (3) Some of the resort staff are not very friendly and downright rude. (4) It's incredibly HOT and the sun is about twice a strong as it is in the states. Bring at least SPF 45 products. (5) Housekeeping is hit or miss. They don't always change your sheets!! (6) Bring lots of small bills because the people here are very hesitant to give you smaller US currency back as change. (7) There is very little space for clothes in these rooms so be prepared to live out of your suitcase. (8) Towels at the pool/beach are only available on an exchange system so you have to take your dirty towels back to the pool the next time you go. (9) It's true that you will not need to take anti-diarrheals while at the resort becouse it hits you after you get back home and can last for upto a week!!! (10) A lot of Europeans are at this resort...their manners are a bit different.It was a pretty miserable vacation overall. Even the kids wanted to go back home early!! We will never be going back to this resort again. I'd much rather go to a beach resort in Florida than a Carribean destination.

<Content>Great time! My girlfriend (27) and I (30) stayed here from June 17th-20th. We had a great time.We got to the hotel around 11:00am and the room was ready by 12:15 (even though they say 3:00, it will be ready earlier). We were on the beach by 12:30 and had NO problems getting chairs.As pretty much all the reviews have said, the grounds are immaculate. We didn't notice any peacock poop as some have said. They work hard to keep them this clean.We were on the first floor, the air worked great, we left our maid $4 the first day and plenty of towels and beverages every day after. We were at the pool everyday by 10:00 and again had zero problems getting chairs. The weather showed rain everyday, but it rained for about 5 minutes and that was it the entire trip.There were people there who complained about little things...their room was humid, they didn't like the food, IT WAS TOO HOT (if we heard this one more time). You have to realize where you are!!We visited the other two hotels, but only ate at the Bavaro. The food was good and the buffets had a nice variety. They had 2 beach parties while we were there that included a nice BBQ and a band.We had no problems with our stomachs. Didn't even need all that Immodium and Pepto we packed.Do bring at least 2-3 bottles of sunscreen, you will use it. I got suburn on my shoulders only, which was weird, but I used a 30. I should have used 45 on my shoulders, but 30 was plenty for the rest of my body. Re-apply after swimming, or about every 2 hours.We tried the casino twice and have to agree that the dealers are not the friendliest people. We played blackjack and it was like we were playing a speed tournament. They just zip those cards out there and you don't have much time to react. BUT DO PAY ATTENTION, because they will make mistakes (we saw this more than once). All you have to do is ask to have the cards checked and they will pull them out and look again.If you have kids, make sure you are aware that the beach is very topless.We didn't catch any of the shows, but did do most of the activities during the day (they have plenty).The service at the bars was great. We would tip about $1-$2 every other round or so, but even without tipping, we had no problems getting served. We stuck to Gin  Tonic's and beer and both were fine. We tried the occasional frozen drinks, which weren't that strong, but you can ask for an extra shot on top.If you need to use the ATM, it dispenses pesos and I would recommend getting a ride from the bellboy. It is located near the workers quarters and is a bit of a walk.One last thing. We saw something which we thought was pretty amazing. On your way to the lobby, you will cross over the pond. If there is a bird on the left side sitting by the waters edge, get yourself some bread a camera and watch what happens. If you throw a piece of bread to the bird, instead of eating the bread, the bird takes the bread over to the water, drops it in and waits for a fish to eat the bread. As the fish is eating the bread, the bird grabs the fish and eats it. It was amazing to watch it work.Overall, we would definitely go back. The best advice I can give (which someone on here already gave)...your vacations is what you make of it. If you go in expecting to have a bad time, you will find things wrong. Just enjoy!

<Content>Spectacular Resort My husband and I with four of our friends just returned and we all were overwhelming thrilled. The rooms were all junior suites and exceptionally clean, large and comfortable. The gardens and grounds are manicured to perfection. The staff was helpful and pleasant.  We did notice that at the pool bar it helped if you knew Spanish, but our drinks were cold and plentiful.  The snorkeling right off the beach is outstanding, if you are a beginner like me. We took one excursion to the Marinarium to swim with the sharks and stingrays. Don't miss that day!!!! It was a blast!!! The food at the buffets is always fresh and presented with style. For American cuisine go to the Rock Cafe at the sister resort.(Just a short walk or golf cart ride away and very well air conditioned.)The restaurants were fine but not excellent. Don't be shy to ask if an extra seating is available. We missed the Japanese and heard that it was the best. Oh well, just another reason to go back. Nightly entertainment is a bit cheesy but fun and relaxing. We noticed the younger 20 and 30 somethings along with families were mostly at the Iberostar Punta Cana and the Iberostar Dominicana, which left the calm and breeze to us. We never ever had trouble finding open chairs at the pool or beach. Plenty of room for many visitors.  The casino is small but a cool distraction. Don't expect Vegas. Be aware that a taxi ride outside of the resort can be very scary and we didn't find ANY reason to leave a second time.  You are not allowed to bring back 151 Rum but other rum is ok and you can take out Momajuana (not marijuana) if it has liquid in it. Now you must go (ha ha) to find out what that is.

<Content>Wonderful 2nd time back We just returned June 19th from a 7 day trip at Bavaro. Last year we stayed at Iberostar Punta Cana and decided to upgrade this year. All weather forcasts were calling for thunderstorms everyday, but I see that every year wherever I go and the weather is allways great. I check weather for punta cana on a site called dr1 for true forcast. Anyway 1st day was mostly cloudy, hot and humid but still nice. Day 2 it rained till noon then became sunny hot and hazy, the remainder of the week was all sunshine with rain late at night. The staff rooms and food was all excellant again this year. I have never eaten so much fish and seafood in a week, the beef tips would just melt in your mouth. We only ate in 2 specialty resturants this year as the buffets had so much too choose from and it was all great, We ate at the Star Rock cafe and the Steak house, both was wonderful. It was my wifes birthday so they made her a special brownie cake and sung too her, was very nice. I did notice this year there were more Americans than Euros, but that didnt matter, The euros In june were much more friendlier than they were in April, I made some very good English and German friends while there. The Star Friends (activities) were excellant, If you run into Angel Thomas at the rifle or archery range tell him Hola from Larry. The rooms were plenty large enough for us, after all the only time you're in them is too shower or sleep, the maids were great as well we tipped her $2 bucks a day and the room was allways spotless and restocked. I called the resort 1 week early and requested a beach front room, when we arrived we had a beach front room with a nice sitting patio looking at the ocean and beach. I hear people who email and request and never recieve it, but if you think all the email they must recieve, how could they read or honor all request from people they dont even know. Every year where ever we stay at I allways call and talk to them and make my request, so far Ive recieved what I asked for every time, try and make it personal when you request, after all do you read and reply to ever email that you get, no. The beach is the most beautiful in the world, just wish it had more fish in the water like say Cozemel or Grand Caymen. We loved it so much last year we took my sister n law and her friend this year and all just loved it, they work really hard for low wages and allways treat you like royality. This was the first time that we have ever returned to same resort or country 2 years in a row, and would definately recomend this place for couples and family, however the younger adults looking for a party place like cancoun would be dissappointed, there is no town. I would return in a heart beat, but doubt if I'll be back there for a few years, have other countires to visit, but I will allways look for a Iberostar resort where ever I go. Pack the sunscreen, bathing suits and a smile, sit back relax and be pampered for your stay, as I said down there Casa se mi casa, my home away from home, and the staff treats you like that too.

<Content>It was just ok Hi, we stayed at the resort the week Of June11-18. The resort is nice. If you have stayed at some other Iberosatr properties before, lets just say that this one is about 2 stars less than Iberostar Tucan in Mexico. The highlight of the trip is the beach-beatiful and has a lot of little sun huts, which is great. The food was good, not great buffets but you can always find something to eat. When we were chosing our destination we decided on Punta Cana because we had heard good things but after traveling to Cancun and Riviera Maya for 8 years, i was very disappointed!!!

<Content>Fantastic!!! Me and my partner (both early 20's) stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro and I cant fault it one bit.The beach was amazing, everybody's friendly. food was fantastic!How can u complain when you're having caviar on toast for brekkie and lobster and kia royal for tea! Didnt get a poorly tummy as all the food was very fresh and there was such a turnover there wasn't time for anything to get warm.The Star Team were great entertainment, although appeal more to the kids. The Pool Bar was a great novelty, although I must admit that seemed to be the only thing that made the Bavaro 'better' than the Dominicana and Punta Cana.We spent most of our time in the Dominicana as there were more English people there (Bavaro mostly Americans) and the pool was more lively.I got bitten quite a bit so I would suggest Malaria tablets. We spoke to many people who didnt bother but better to be safe.The only downside to the hol was the haggling. If you went in a shop there were no prices on anything. We bought a bottle of mamajuana (local drink). He told us it was $20 and we thought we'd done well to get him down to $15. We then saw it in another shop for $3!!! It made me angry that they're allowed to rip you off like that so be careful.Keep lots of peso in change for tips. We left the maid $5 a day, but it appears we were leaving far too much. Others were leaving a dollar here and there. Make sure you save $20 each for departure tax as the only accept dollar and not peso or card. Last of all, be careful with your baggae allowance. We were over coming out but told that at Punta Cana airport they charge $10 for every Kilo over. We had been warned that their scales are in 'favour' of the airport, so coming home we got rid of a lot of stuff. A litre of Rum is a kilo in weight so if your not careful you can end up paying $10 extra, defeats the object of buying it cheap!On the whole it was the best hol i've ever had and wouldn't hesitate going back!

<Content>It was wonderful I just returned from my trip to the Bavaro and I was very pleased. There were a few issues but for the most part it was great. The postives about this resort is that there are 3 hotels and defiantly stay at the Bavaro, you stay in bungalows which are great and the arrangement is wonderful. But it is very convient that you could go the the iberostar dominicana next door. The people here were great always trying to get people involved. During the day and night time everyone was friendly and workers were cleaning the resort which is a huge plus. It is a nice place for kids because they try to get you involved but there are plenty of activities for adults as well. The rooms are huge and very roomy you feel comfortable being in one for a week and there is also a mini bar which is convinent. The pool and beach were both great. I spent most of my time on the beach because if you are a beach lover you will absolutly love this place. The pools were nice as well with a swim up bar. The food was very good for an all inclusive ive been to 5 different all-inclusive resorts and this one was defiantly up there on the food. You can basically eat at any of the buffets throughout all of the hotels but my family and I ate at the main buffet at ours i belive three times and there was a variety, but the end we were a little tired of seeing some of the same stuff. But the food is all wonderful and there is a nice variety. We ate lunch right by the beach and pools everyday and went to the Dominicana buffet for lunch one day on the beach as well. It was a great variety for lunch, and they have an ice cream hut which is a nice snack in the afternoon. There is also a sports bar inbetween the Bavaro and Dominicana, where my family and I did not go there but I heard it was good. You can choose three specialty restaurants and my family and I choose the Mediterannian, Gourmet, and the Japanese. The Med. is basically a seafood restuarant where you get to choose your entree and it was great. The Gourmet serves lobster and it just serves you everything on the menu starting with an appetizer, soup, another food item, and then your lobster. It was all great and it was plenty of food. The Japanese was my favorite it was great even if you dont like that kind of food. There is chicken terriakye, and a variety of other entrees. They do bring you out sushi for an appetizer. Room service is included when you stay here and it was very good. The service took about 20min for a pizza but it was worth it.The bars were all very nice and everyone was friendly but the drinks were just average. I was a little disappointed with the drinks. The one thing that was nice with drinks in the looby was every night they would have a stnad type thing by the bar and they would make tester type of drinks and it was a new drink everynight, that was a lot of fun and different. Other then that there just wasnt much of a variety and they were just ok. The nightlife was really good at first but it got a little boring towards the end. Some of the shows are good and funny. They like to get the audience involved which can be really funny at times. The casino is over at the Dominicana and it was alright. They have a few tables and some machines. I didnt win anything at all. But one of the friends I met while there won $250. The bars are a pretty good time at night there are usually a lot of people around them. The disco is not very big, there is a bar in there and some couchs around. It is usually pretty crowded, and they play a lot of spanish music but it is fun because of the enviroment you are in. You can snorkel for an hour everyday for free, you can take out catamars for an hour every day for free, and you can also take out kayaks so that is nice. My family and I did not do anything extra except for the massage on the beach which was nice. The shopping is nice here there are plenty of places to go to get your souviners. There are shops on the beach which are a lot of fun, then there is a street of shops in the resort and there is also a few stores by the disco. A few disappointments are at night the whole beach is lit up so its not very romantic because you feel like you are on a spotlight. There is a shuttle that takes you from the Bavaro to the Dominicana where the casino is but it isnt run very efficently which can be annoying at times. You usually have to ask and they will take you but you shouldnt have to ask. Some of the people were hard to communicate with because of the spanish so its nice to know some but it can fun talking to them.A few nice things were the scenary was beautiful there were animals throughout the resort which was nice. There are huts on the beach which you can lay under and it is very tropical of a setting. The security is good as well they make you feel safe but they are not overprotected. Overall I would suggest coming here there is plenty to do with the 3 hotels, the food is not bad and it is beautiful!

<Content>Trip review 6\4\05-6\11\05 We found almost everything at the Iberostar Bavaro to be excellent. This review will focus on things not often mentioned on this site, such as the diving options, etc. Like most others, we found the grounds to be impeccable, the food good, the staff friendly and helpful. We found that the tourists came across as unfriendly and often wouldn't return a greeting when passing by. What we discovered after some interaction however, is that most were not unfriendly, just did not speak English. I don't believe the staff or tourists to be standoffish, nor do I think it is a cultural difference. We found everyone we made the effort to communicate with to be friendly, especially on the dive boats, once we overcame the language barrier. All of the dive guides speak several languages, and our guide from Dressel Divers (Nestor) speaks 5 or 6. He made it very easy for all of us to communicate and have a wonderful time! I'm sure he felt like he was translating for the United Nations!We highly recommend Dressel Divers, and they are located at the Iberostar Bavaro. We use Dressel exclusively in Cozumel and the D.R. They have the best teams, and their focus on safety, staff training, and customer service is unsurpassed. We took the excursion dive trips to Catalina Island on Wednesday, and to Sanoa Island on Friday. Both were 2 tank dives, but Sanoa was our favorite. But with Dressel Divers, the dives are just the beginning! They prepared a wonderful bar-b-que lunch on the island both days, and we made stops at other wonderful places along the way, including water tours by the famous people mansions and yachts, and snorkeling with the starfish, which turned into a HUGE party of about 10 boats, with everyone enjoying the end of a wonderful day! We had several couples on our boat that only one of the pair was a diver. Dressel made it possible for the non-diver to snorkel while the rest of us made dives, and they also provided a snorkel guide!Just a few notes:1) Cell phones DO work here. Though all of us prefer to leave them at home, sometimes that is not feasible. Do not count on anyone being able to reach you through the hotel switchboard. Two family members tried calling us and never got through to our room. 2) The Casino staff are very unfriendly toward tourists, but they chatter incessantly among themselves. Even with heavy tipping, we couldn't thaw them out. The casino has about 25 slot machines, 2 roulette wheels, 2 poker tables (their version is similar to Caribbean Stud), and 4 or 5 blackjack tables. We had good luck at the poker tables, but next time I won't waste money tipping! (Except the bartender, she was exceptional)3) Tipping elsewhere DOES help, and is well deserved. I highly recommend taking a stack of $1's. Makes it so much easier not to worry about running out of change! These people work 16 hour days for days on end, for very little pay.4) If you have long or thick hair, take your own hairdryer. The wattage is very low on their dryers, and it takes a while to dry your hair.We had a fabulous time and we will return next year. The Bavaro is a wonderful Iberostar property, and they are to be commended on the service and atmosphere they provide! Please email if you have questions! Have a wonderful vacation!

<Content>A great family holiday We just came home from the iberostar bavaro resort, it was an amazing holiday!Me and my family have been to the Caribbean 4 times now and we all agree that this was the best holiday yet!We spent the day either by the pool or on the beach.If you do go and want to go on some trips, 1 trip I would recommend is the Dominican Discovery. You get to see different parts of the Dominican Republic. You get shown and get to try some sugar cane, Go horseback riding (you would think it would be hot on a horse but when you are on it you don鈥檛 notice the heat!)You also get shown how you make coffee and hot chocolate. Then you swim in a nearby river.It was a long day but allot of fun.The food is excellent! in the buffet there were allot of things to choose from. What it doesn鈥檛 tell you in the brochure is that if you stay in the Bavaro resort you are also allowed in the dominicana and Punta cana resorts which are right next door.We went to Domincana's Mexican restaurant and their Tropical.I am Glad that we payed the extra to go to Bavaro it was amazing.

<Content>Nice but not great and not our favorite Iberostar property Hello, or Hola, we just arrived home yesterday from a 7 night stay at Iberostar Bavaro. This was our 6th Ibeorstar property visited and first time to the Dominican Republic. Another very nice Iberostar property however I must say that we were not nearly as happy with the Dominican Republic properties as we are with the Mexico facilities and people. We watched the weather forecast for two weeks prior to arriving on May 29 and the outlook was terrible. It called for heavy rain everyday. We considered canceling last minute and rebooking but could not make it work so we just took a chance. Luckily the weather people are as bad at forecasting other countries as they are back here at home because it rained for about 5 minutes during the day on Friday and that was it except for a couple of times at night when we slept. The rest of the time was clear. Let me tell you something right off the bat, it is freaking hot!!!!! Way hotter then Mexico. Mid 90鈥檚 during the day and high 70鈥檚 to low 80鈥檚 at night with about 90% humidity. It was smothering. A big complaint we have about this property is the air at the restaurants. It was terrible. The only one that was half way decent was at the Pagoda at the Dominicana property. That was a relief. The rest had air but you would be sitting at your table and could feel the sweat forming on your body. And I assure you it was not just me. It was a routinely talked about subject around the complex. The air in the room was another story. Very good!!!! This property is old. Dominican Republic was the first area that Iberostar expanded to after they originally opened in Spain so this place has been around awhile. The air conditioning in the room was a simple switch high/med/low and stayed on all the time so when you got back to your room it was very nice. The newer properties in Mexico etc. have thermostats that only allow the temp to be about 74 and it goes off when you leave the room unless you attach a string to the pull cord on the ceiling fan and hang a piece of paper on it so that it flutters around and fakes out the motion sensor (great hint). It would take a long time for the room to cool down when you got back. I read another review that described the motion sensors here too so I don't know if some have them or not. Ours did not. There was a sensor on the patio door that would shut the air off if the door remained open so maybe that is what they were talking about.The beach was fantastic!!!!!!! No waves to speak of because the entire Bavaro beach is secluded by a reef about a half of a mile out. The waves break over the reef and are very gentle by the time they reach shore. If you are looking for big waves to body surf or boogie board on, this is not the place. There is great snorkeling from the beach in front of the hotel. Lots of smaller reefs in the swim area and I saw a huge assortment of fish including barracudas and permit. We brought light fishing tackle and got raw shrimp  squid from the buffet each night to use for bait the next morning. Shrimp was the preferred bait. We caught permit, snapper, small grouper, needle fish, parrot fish and stuff we were not sure about. Great morning fun before the oven turned on around 10:00. Also, there is an excursion that we took that was set up by the Apple Vacation guy were we snorkeled in a protected area and then got to be in a fenced off area with huge nurse sharks and rays. Afterward you were taken to a secluded beach to swim before being taken back. I think it was called Mariana or something like that. (they also included sandwich鈥檚 and drinks). We tried deep sea fishing too but that was a bust. There were people on the boat that had fished the previous day that were staying at our hotel and they said that they caught 3 Marlin and some Dorado (dolphin fish). It just was not that way the day we went. We thought that the buffet food was very good and preferred it over all of the restaurants except the Mediterranean and Gourmet however you were not give a choice of entr茅e at the gourmet. Not that lobster was upsetting to us but there are lots of people with shellfish allergies that would have a problem. The gourmets at other Iberostars offer a choice of meat, pasta or fish so I do not know what the difference is here. I know people knock the buffets at all inclusive resorts but you have to remember that they are trying to please people from many countries and the things that they like would make us turn up our noses and vice versa. They also have to make things that kids will try. That is why they have pizza, burgers, dogs etc. I would find it hard to believe that you could not find something to your liking. There is a grill area that had steaks, chops  chicken all the time so you could have a nice steak every night if that is your thing. There was always a big cut of some kind of meat that was carved to order too. We loved it. BEWARE, the buffet is not air conditioned. Go early because the food sits out in the heat. Things like cold salads, cheeses, lunch meats etc. do not stay chilled for very long. The property itself was very nice. The rooms were in groups of 4 I believe in small buildings. They were all connected by a common walkway that leads back to the main lobby and restaurant area. The Dominicana and Punta Cana properties were very different. They were each one large building with all the rooms in them. Not our cup of tea. We are glad we picked this one. Also, if you stay at Bavaro you can eat at the others but not vice versa. There is a casino at the Punta Cana if that is your thing but it was very small. The pool and swim up bar was wonderful and warm. Because the property is so old, the plant life is very well established. There are huge towering palm trees. We saw a guy at the show area get hit in the head by a coconut that fell from a tree that had to be at least 50鈥? The next day there was a guy climbing the tree and other ones nearby to cut down the coconuts and trim back the branches. It was interesting to watch the guy climbing the trees with a rope sling arrangement between his feet. The shows were good and a nice change from the Mexico area. We went to Mexico 5 years in a row and stayed at a different property each time but all Iberostar. Del Mar, Cozumel, Lindo, Quetzal and Maya. The shows were identical at all of them. There were a couple things that were similar here but for the most it was different.There are some shops on the beach down from the hotel about a quarter mile if that. The beach area between the hotel and there is pretty polluted with garbage and really needs to be cleaned up. It would take 4 guys an hour to do it but they do not because I suppose it is not their property and therefore not their problem. There were guys raking the sea grass on the beach each morning and a bulldozer that would come down for them to shovel the grass into the scoop to be taken away. Why not keep going and pick up the trash? You would probably only have to do it once a month or so. Just a thought. There are also many stray dogs on the beach that are harmless and will beg you for food if you have it. We saw a mom with 5 puppies that were very friendly. There were also stray cats and kittens that roamed the property itself. Not many indigenous critters though. I was expecting iguanas and lizards everywhere like Mexico but we only saw a couple small geckos. There were some interesting birds. At night there were owls that you could see once and a while and lots of stuff during the day. The Peacocks made a sound that we swear sounded more like a cats meow then any cat could ever make. It was weird and they got going pretty early every morning. We are morning people and are up by 5:30 so no big deal to us but I bet there were a few people that would have rung their necks if they could. The people did not seem as friendly here. The Mexico properties seem to have more people willing to help. We noticed a few times that we were bothering people if we asked something of them. We noticed it a couple of times and never at the Mexico properties. Nobody was mean or unwilling to help but there was definately a different feeling to us. The internet caf茅 arrangement had me fuming. You buy 30 minutes at the desk at Bavaro and they give you a sign on name and password good for 30 minutes. You then have to walk all the way to the other end to the Dominicana property were the caf茅 is located. We had trouble signing on and needed to get another password. We went to the front desk at the Dominicana and explained the problem and were told that we would have to walk all the way back to the other hotel to get another password. I asked if we could just call over to get one or just buy 30 more minutes from them. We were told no and with an attitude I might add. That to us was stupid!!!! As we were leaving to go back I glanced back and the person had a smirk that I would have gladly smacked off his face. Anyway, that was the only occurrence of that sort.Overall the Bavaro was nice. It does not compare to Pariaso Lindo or Maya and probably would compare more to Quetzal or Tucan in Mexico. We chose Bavaro because we found it on sale and got a great price and thought it would be nice to try something new. You cannot go wrong with Iberostar. If we had not gone to the other locations we would probably have thought more of this one. I would not say that we will never go back but if given the choice, Pariaso Lindo  Maya in Mexico will get our vote every time!!!!! E-mail me with any questions. Hope you will find this information useful.

<Content>Hated to come home Just returned from a weeks vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro. I greatly enjoyed our vacation however there is always room for some improvement. Here is a recap of our experience: Upon arrival at the resort (approximately 11 a.m.), we were told that our rooms would not be ready until approximately 2 p.m. and that we could go eat and swim until they would be ready. I guess I understand that they need time to prepare the rooms, however, it was VERY hot and you had to dig around in your suitcases along with a ton of other suitcases to find other clothes or a bathing suit and we had to lug our carryon bag with us everywhere because I wasn't leaving it unattended in the lobby area. By the time we got our room, I was dying for some air conditioning. I had previously requested a second floor room with two double beds and got a first floor room with a king size bed. I was not happy with this since we had our 7 year old daughter with us and they were expecting her to sleep on a hard sofa couch. I also wanted a private room and this one's balcony was right next to a sidewalk. They told me that they didn't have anything available to change to and to check back in the morning. In the morning, I was told that they had a room on the second floor with a king size bed or a room on the first floor with two double beds. They told me the room numbers and waited for me to check out where they were located. We ended up taking the second floor room since we liked the location and my daughter didn't seem to mind the sofa bed the first night. They then came and moved our luggage very quickly. Now some good news: The resort itself was extremely beautiful. I just loved the lush greenery with peacocks, flamingos, ducks, and all kinds of birds roaming around. Everything was very clean. The beach is also the nicest I have ever seen. I have been to the Riviera Maya which is kind of similar but I think the Bavaro Beach is just breathtaking. The restaurants were nice. There was a large assortment of food to pick from at the buffet. - My only problem was the heat. It was so humid the week we were there that it wasn't really comfortable to eat because most of the restaurants are open air except for some of the specialty restaurants which I still thought were hot. I felt sorry for the men who had to wear pants. I'm sure that there are other times during the year, however when the weather isn't so humid. We also had a problem with our air conditioning in our second room. I almost wished we stayed in the first room because it worked a lot better. They did have ceiling fans, however, which did help. The bathrooms didn't have any air - by the time I finished blow drying my hair I was sweating. We also managed to blow the electic the last night we were there. I was drying my hair and my husband was ironing a shirt and we completely lost power and sat for a hour in our room in the dark until someone came to fix it. Now, back to some more good stuff: The drinks were very good at the lobby bar and at the pool bar. There is also a neat little bar on the beach that has hot dogs and snacks too. The pool was OK -I have seen nicer ones but this one was laid out nice for my 7 year old and you could put your lounges right in the water which was nice in the heat. Most of the staff were very friendly - they seem to have a lot of activities going on even though we didn't participate in much of it. Two times when we were their they had a beach/pool party at lunch that was really nice. They really do try make things special and fun. You can also go to the Iberostar Dominicana and Iberostar Punta Cana next door which was a nice change of pace. We didn't get to see much of the shows at night since my 7 year old was too tired to stay awake. I am grateful that they did have room service because she passed out on us early a few times (too much swimming and sun) and we couldn't leave to eat. We did have some ants in our suitcase which kind of freaked me out a little and a small lizard came into our room through the door that I had to chase around to get back out but I guess that is to be expected. I didn't see any mosquitoes and very few other insects. Overall, our vacation was very nice and I would return in a heartbeat. We have been to quite a few five and six apple resorts that I think my expectations are maybe getting a little bit high. I think my only recommendation would be to go at a different time of the year when it is not quite so hot. We did, however, get a really awesome deal that I shouldn't complain.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro Did Not Meet Our Expectations Arrival from CVG to Punta Cana was on time and the meal was good. There was a movie on the plane but the screens by our seats were all distored and you could not watch them. So we had to watch the screen a few rows up to see the movie. Once we got to Punta Cana things went smoothly at the airport. We got through immigrations easily and found our Apple Rep who showed us to our air conditioned bus. I have to say the ride from the airport to the resort was little scary. Locals at certain locations had machine guns, there were several little shacks made out of blocks, tin roofs, and bars on the windows. The road to the resort had several pot holes so not lots of road maintenance going on in this area. We arrived at the resort and checked in but found out that our villa was right next to where they feed the peacocks (I had been previously warned about this by a co-worker who just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro. I requested a different room and we were told there were no other rooms available and to check back tomorrow. Well, we didn't want to unpack and repack so we discussed it and decided how bad could it be? Well, we were up close to the lobby/buffet/entertainment so we had a morning wake up call by screaming peacocks at 5:30 am - 7:00 a.m. so forget sleeping in on this vacation. There was also cocka everywhere on the walkways that the maintenance crew tried to keep cleaned up the between the peacocks and the geese wandering around, there were several piles to dodge on the concrete pathways. Dinner was really good at the Mediteranean and the Gourmet Speciality Restaurants and the were air conditioned. The Japanese Restaurant was air conditioned but the food was nothing special. We were warned by other guests at the resort to avoid the Steak Restuarant so we didn't try that one. Then we went to eat in the Buffet with open-air and no airconditioning. Needless to say the food was open on platters but uncovered so it was exposed to flies and nats so you were not sure about how hygenically clean the food was after sitting out in the heat like that. It was very hot and humid the week we were there so it made our dining experience quite uncomfortable. At times, it was difficult to find foods that we could both eat but we managed. The wait staff was excellent and very friendly which saved the trip for our as far as dining. So our biggest complaint was all of the open-air areas at the resort. In the heat of the day, if you could not take any more sun at the pool, the only place you could go that was air conditioned was back to your room which was unfortunate. We did sign up for massages through the Spa and they were wonderful. We met a few different couples but immediately experienced the language barriers between Americans and the other Eurpopeans that vacationed at this resort. There were also issues with very limited English from the resort staff. Very basic English words were known but we really need to brush up on our Spanish before this trip. We arrived on Saturday and by Tuesday we were so frustrated that we went to talk to our Apple Vacations Rep. His suggestion was to get on a cancellation list for the Specialty Restaurants so we could dine in air conditioning and also go on an excursion to get away from the resort for a day. That was the intent of going to an all-incluvie (6 apple) resort was so we could stay, eat, relax and be entertained in one place. The room was clean but the bed was hard and every now and them you good feel a bed spring in your ribs. The rooms were cool while you were in them but there was a motion detector that if it did not sense movement after 10 minutes, all the power in the room shut off (no a/c, no TV, no lights, etc.). This was a power conservation effort I guess but the water and beer in our minifridge didn't really get that cold unless we camped out in the room for a while so the fridge could get cold. The weather was sunny, hot and humid. The beach was beautiful and the grounds at the resort were impeccable. They really keep up the grounds of this resort. Maid service was good most days. A couple of times we didn't get any wash cloths and had to call the front desk.The trip back to the airport was kind of the icing on the cake for us. Apple Vacations picks up 8 people in a mini van and tried to pile all of our lugguge in the back (which didn't work). So they had to move some of our luggage onto a different van (that was scary). The A/C barely worked in the van and we all smashed together like sardines so it was stuffy and hot. Not fun. The Apple Rep did apologize for his poor vehicle selection but too late, you know. Then we got to the airport and had to go through Security only to find out that the USA3000 flight was not even in the computer so not one person could check in. This took about 30 minutes to get this worked out in the heat and humidity just standing in line waiting to check-in. Then we found out that our flight was an hour and half late arriving to Punta Cana so we were 1 hour late taking off for our return to Cincinnati.In summary, all in all, me and my fiance had a great time with each other and spending our vacation together. We had fun with the wait staff in the various restaurants and appreciated all of their hard works. We tipped alot over the week and felt it was well deserved. They work very hard for probrobably not alot of pay. I don't think we would go back to Punta Cana or this resort. We had a much better vacation in 2003 in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. It was alot more Americanized and easier to communicate. The language barrier was not even an issue at all. We would go back to Playa in a heart beat. We have just chalked this up to a learning experience. We both said that there were things we enjoyed and we would miss the people but we were ready to come home. I guess we were just expecting something different that what we got. Next trip I will try and do more research to avoid these issues in the future. Lee  Kelly, Dayton, OH

<Content>Sure isn't a Sandals!! We have just returned from a week in Punta Cana at the Iberostar Bavaro. We were there for our 10th wedding anniversary for 7 days. Started out with twin beds, that was an easy fix, but hauling our carry on's back to the front desk was a pain. This place is huge. If you want a quiet vacation, with few people. DON'T go here!! The food was great, alot of fish and muscles, etc. The service is not great unless you start tipping from the start. The same people basically service you from the start of the day to the end, so if you tip right away they will take care of you. Make sure you have at least $100 worth of $1 bills. You will need them. Make sure to tip the bartenders well, otherwise you will sit and wait for a drink. Take an umbrella, because it does rain and they do not supply you with umbrellas. They will send you to the gift shop to buy a cheapo umbrella for $36. There were little black bugs in our room that you could hardly see. The maids would put lovely flowers in our room everyday, but they attracted the bugs. I threw the flowers out immediately. If you plan on laying on the beach . . . take something that you can reserve a chair. They say no reserving, but we never could find a place to sit. You need to be up at 7am and go reserve your chairs. I would recommend doing the same thing at the pool if you want under a tree. Make sure you can speak the basics in Spanish because they can hardly understand English. I recommend taking at least a 35 SPF sunblock and make sure to take some aftersun gel. The sun rays just bake you. We didn't take a string enough spf and needed aftersun gel, paid $27 for 2 small bottles at the resort. Make sure to take some ammodium, you will need it! Take something to entertain yourself at the airport in Punta Cana, we were taken there at 3:45 and our plane didn't leave until 7:35. Takes about 15 minutes to get thru security and then you sit the rest of the time. We visited Sandals in Jamaica a year ago and the service there was outstanding. I would recommend it anyday!

<Content>Married on the neach I was married on the beach of the Punta cana on 12th July 2004.I loved this resort, the punta cana is the hotel furthest away from the Bavaro (the Dominicana is in the middle).I stayed for 2 weeks with my husband and wedding guests.We had no problems with the food, other than severly overeating.The BBQ lobster on the beach is beyond yummy!I tried all the al a carte restaurants during my stay. The most dramatic to look at is the oriental, but the best food was at the american diner next to the night club. I warn you to go easy on the dominican rum it is 36%!I stayed in a room very close to the main building, the lack of sea view was amply compensated for by the size of the room, well stocked mini bar, marble bathroom and large balcony.Having holidayed in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia before, i must say Dominican is a beautiful place. Whether you are a couple or family, you will love this hotel  holiday.

We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro resort from 6 - 13 May 2005.The transfer from the airport is around 40 minutes.Rooms: located in small units of 8 throughout a beautiful garden. Our room was on the 2nd floor in unit 24, within easy reach of all the facilities, but not noisy. Room was large and very clean with a nice balcony with a bench. You have to keep in mind that the room is not brandnew anymore, but still very nice. No alarm clock and there is a fee for the safe (usd 15 for 8 days). There's room for improvement here.Food: Breakfast buffet in main restaurant Los Haitises very good with lots of choices for everyone. Surrounded by water and lots of ducks, flamingos's etc which add a nice touch to the atmosphere.We dined at the Japanese and the Gourmet restaurant (both very good )and the Steak House (the pool buffet at night is being set up as cosy steak house with ocean view) and also very good, meat tender and tasty.Poolbuffet offers breakfast and lunch, adequate choices and nice to sit down after the meal for a while with coffee, icecream or a cocktail!The main buffet at night offers a different theme every night. Again, lots of choices for everyone. For the less adventurous, there's pizza and fries every day.Pool and beach have sufficient palapas and lounge chairs.Staff is very kind and always going out of their way to help you or pour you another drink. Absolutely very nice and helpful! We did have some negative points: a few rainshowers (not uncommon, though) and a large group of around 200 people that put a negative stamp on the atmosphere. In a family resort like this it should not have been allowed that this group used its own animation team and even a megaphone. Very loud music and even an irritating helicopter accompanied their noisy group acitivities on the beach and in the pool. An absolute bummer. We went to the other hotels to find a quite spot.Other things of interest: no mosquitos, topless is not that common, keep in mind that you are not at home so food is different. No complaints about stomache problems though. All in all we enjoyed our vacation and will certainly return to Iberostar.If you are in doubt about this hotel and the Iberostar Paraiso Lindo in Mexico, go to Mexico. It is new and at least one star better than the Bavaro,but you will notice a price difference as well.If you go to Iberostar: HAVE FUN!

<Content>Very Nice Experience Overall My wife and I recently returned from a seven-day vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro Resort. Overall, I would rate the place as very nice, although there could have been a few minor improvements. Would we return, you might ask? Yes!The grounds are extremely well-kept as you might have read. Even after some late-night parties after the bars had closed, the groundskeepers made sure that most debris had been removed by mid-morning. The landscaping is very well-designed and executed. One element I found interesting was the use of Zoysia grass all around. This kind of grass flourishes in dry climates, crowds out weed growth and requires less maintenance. It is rather uncomfortable to walk on in bare feet, however, so be advised!The climate was generally hot and humid by day, with temperatures during the day in the upper 80's or low 90's with high humidity. At night, it was generelly cooler, temps in the upper 70's to low-80's. I was surprised to find very comfortable Atlantic breezes at night, and even often during the day. This tended to counteract the intense sun and high humidity. We very much enjoyed the almost-deserted beach at night after late dinner, in which my wife and I often sat in lounge chairs and watched fishermen and a few small fishing vessels south of the resort. By the way, star-gazers--I have seldom seen a more breathtaking view of the stars and planets!Bavaro Beach was undoubtedly the high point of our trip. It is, in my estimation, one of the world's most splendid beaches. As one might expect, the water is aqua-colored, kissing fine off-white sand. However, I was surprised to find very little sea weed and other unwanted plant species evident. Only after an evening of high winds might one find a small accumulation of sea weeds. My wife and I snorkeled almost every day. It was easy to see all the way to the bottom without the snorkles! There was an interesting and diverse variety of fish just off shore. There is a continuous coral reef which runs just offshore, protecting plant and animals alike and breaking up wave action off the Atlantic.The accomodations were nice. I would rate thyem as more than adequate, not exactly deluxe, but not Motel 6 by any stretch of the imagination. Our bed was large and comfortable, but the pillows were flat and not comfortable at all. The air conditioning worked extremely well throughout the trip, something we welcomed after a hard day out at the beach! A nice touch was the ceiling fan over the bed, something we both used and appreciated. The mini-bar was nice, although there was a limited supply of drinks. It is only re-stocked every two days. You can call the front desk to order more, but generally, my requests were not followed up on very well.All rooms are junior suites, which include a sitting area and outside balcony. We were in Room 2425, located just steps from the pools and swim-up bar. It was also a short walk to towels, food, and of course, one of several bars.We made it a point to tip our maids every couple days. They work very hard with little recognition. My brother had stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro the previous year and had tipped his maid thirty dollars toward the end of the trip. She almost broke down into tears, remarking that it represented several weeks' worth of salary! Don't forget to tip for good service! I did notice that Americans seemed to be some of the only guests to tip on a regular basis. The Spaniards and French we saw were particularly bad at leaving tips, not only at the bar and restaurant, but at night at their tables while watching the entertainment. A dollar (or Euro as it were) goes a long way here--Drop down,  as my old man used to often say!Well, I have got to leave for work. I'll finish my assessment of the Iberostar Bavaro later on. Ciao!

<Content>Great place to go. Punta Cana is HOT! Be prepared to spend most of your days at the resort either in your room (Why?) or poolside. The beach is perfect. The Bavaro had plenty of lounges both covered and uncovered available and we never had a problem finding one. The water was rougher than I had anticipated but was a very pleasant place to go. It is VERY salty. When you come out of the water you will see dried salt on your skin, hair, etc. There were absolutely no vendors harassing us on the beach unlike in Mexico where you had to dodge them even at the hotels. There are beach front stores to the right of the Bavaro beach but they don鈥檛 really offer good prices on anything. We found that it was sometimes even cheaper to buy from the stores at the resort than it was from the vendors. Our Apple Vacations representative advised us to visit the beach stores early in the day to check for prices and then go back at 5:30, about 30 minutes before they close and offer about half what they originally quoted you for. Don鈥檛 feel too bad offering little money when you realize that the average Dominican resident brings in about $1000 U.S./month. The guys at these stores are lazy compared to the people who do back-breaking labor for ten times less money. The hotel grounds are beautifully maintained by the hardest working people I have ever seen. Instead of tipping bartenders who are generously tipped my most other guests and who work in SHADED areas, I tipped groundskeepers who toil under the hot sun from early morning until late in the afternoon. There are plenty of peacocks wandering the grounds and they are loud. They sound like giant cats in heat. We also saw fat geese every day, flamingos, and some annoying little black duck thing with huge yellow feet.The rooms are very nice albeit moldy smelling. This should be expected when you consider the elements outside of your room. It was humid 24/7. If the smell is something that would bother you I suggest bringing a plug-in room deodorizer and leaving your balcony door open when you can. There are no screen doors but we never had problems with any insects. The water pressure in our room was always strong with plenty of hot and 鈥渃old鈥?water to go around. I use the word 鈥渃old鈥?loosely because the coldest water you will probably get is room temperature. I didn鈥檛 complain because people in DR have to conserve water in plastic drums because they are not guaranteed running water on a daily basis while those of us at the resorts can bathe to our hearts content. The king-size beds are huge with a fan directly above it to help circulate the AC at night. The bathroom has a bidet! I know it鈥檚 not a big deal to the Euros (who make up most of the guest population) but it got to the point that I want one here in Chicago. It just makes you feel that much cleaner. The mini-bar was a disappointment. It consisted of several bottles of water, some Presidente brand beers, diet Coke, Coke, Fanta, Sprite and Tonic Water but no other alcohol. The fridge is restocked every other day but a quick call to the front desk can also do the job if needed.The food at the buffet was very good. I don鈥檛 know what some other people here are complaining about but there is something for just about anyone. We made reservations to three of the ala carte restaurants. The Japanese restaurant was OK. The meat needed at least some soy sauce or something to make it taste Asian. The Mediterranean restaurant located right next door was good. The hot food buffet which is the meal starter was actually quite good and for an entr茅e I ordered a plate of mussels which was excellent. Our third restaurant was La Ballena the gourmet restaurant which is located across a small pond from the main buffet in a glass-walled room. Not really good for a gourmet restaurant but it redeemed itself with the main course which was grilled lobster. I would have been happy with buffet food all week but we had to give the restaurants a try.The one excursion we took was the trip to Saona Island which is on the southern coast of the DR. It cost us $80 each and was worth every penny. First you take a short bus ride to the Apple headquarters about 40 minutes away from the hotel to board a larger bus for a two hour ride to the south. When you reach your destination you board either a catamaran or a speed boat to the island. If you took a speed boat to go there you would come back on a catamaran and vice versa. We took a speed boat to the island (45 minute ride) and stopped to take pictures with starfish along the way. It was very cool. We were about a mile away from shore yet the water was only waist/chest deep in the bluest water you will ever see. The island itself is very nice. We had a nice lunch prepared on the island and there was also an open bar. You spend about 2 陆 hours on the island and can just swim out in the ocean where tropical fish swim all around you or just loaf on the beach. The catamaran ride back (1 hour 45 minutes) was worth the trip. Once again there is an open bar but the view is just beautiful and you can just sit on the edge of the catamaran and sail back home.My only complaint with the vacation was that the resort is too far from many other attractions. We would have liked to have gone to Santo Domingo for a sightseeing trip but I could not stomach a 5 hour bus ride one way. If you don鈥檛 mind relaxing at the resort for a week then this is a great vacation for you.

<Content>Almost Perfect I stayed 4/29 through 5/6 and had a fantastic time. I've read many reviews before we went and I'll tell you what is true and what isn't.First- No Bugs. I was concerned before our arrival but never saw a mosquito.Second- Bring alot of one dollar bills. Americans seem to be the only ones who tip. You definitely get better service. Also,the employees work their tail off and deserve a tip. I took $ 100 in ones and didn't use them all but alot. I never once converted my currency to Peso's. I never found a reason to. If you pay in $ you get $ in return Third- Americans are the minority by far. It takes some getting used to but it was fun being the  odd man out. Prepare your kids for topless bathers because there is alot. We Americans seem to be the only ones who have hang ups about this. After day2 it just seems normal.Fourth- The food was fine. There is such a wide variety of food, if you can't find something you like then you are a miserable person. If you think you are gonna get Pizza Hut Pizza and McDonalds then don't bother going. Remember YOU are in a foreign country. The buffet is more than sufficient. I wouldn't classify the specialty restaurants as Gourmet but it is satisfactory. I have an iron gut but did get a case of the runs. Just expect it take Immodium and forget about it.Fifth- There are alot of kids. Too many for me to call this vacation Perfect.Sixth- It is Hot and a little muggy. You'll use twice as much sunscreen as you planned. The water in the ocean is warm and so is the pool. If you hear people say that it is cold disregard their review.Seventh- Things don't work as well as they do back home. The airconditioners work but aren't as cold. The fridge in your room works but not as cold as home. The hairdryer works but not as hot as home. REMEMBER you are in a third world country. Roll with the punches, you'll have more fun.Eighth-The cervesa of choice is Presidente. It is good and it is usually cold. Don't expect to find too many other brands. If you are looking for a coors light stay at home.Ninth- The nightly entertain is average at bestTenth- The Beach is the best i have ever seen, Overall the entire resort is the best I have ever been to.Tips...Take a safari day trip. I booked mine with Apple the day we got there. It shows you alot about the country. Bring your own snorkel and mask if you can. You get one free hour per day but it is not enough. You can buy one for $ 30. Dominicans are very friendly and work hard.We would go back to this resort without hesitation. We had a great time and can't wait to go back.

<Content>I sailed everyday! My wife and I (seniors) went for two weeks from March 28, 2005, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. What follows are our observations and what worked for us. We left from Halifax, NS, and regretted that we did not buy our duty-free liquor before we left. We like inexpensive French brandy and the selection and prices were better in Halifax.The Iberostar resort consists of three hotels (Iberostar Bavero, I. Dominicana and I. Punta Cana) and we had access to the facilities of two. We were in the older section (the 5000 series of room numbers) which was well maintained and comfortable. We soon discovered that reserving a spot and chairs with shade was necessary in spite of signs forbidding it. Each morning before breakfast I (husband's chore!) put our beach towels on our chairs. A tip: we took a couple of cheap towels of our own for marking the spot mainly because it made our location easier to find amongst the sea of hotel blue! We are beer drinkers so took our own mugs for the beach (16 oz. with snap-on lids) to avoid spillage or otherwise emptying the contents on the way to the beach location. The grounds were very well laid out and immaculately maintained and during our stay we never ceased to admire them. The food was excellent and the buffet restaurants could be a little overwhelming. We got over this by finding a table and then cruising the area to decide ahead of time what we wanted to eat and how many courses. This way we were able to enjoy all they had to offer bearing in mind that one could always go back for more which we rarely did as we were satisfied the first time around! To really enjoy it you have to be a little adventurous.The beach and sea were awesome and we never used the pools once although many did with obvious enjoyment. The pool area was a little noisy as it was the centre of many of the organized activities. We snorkelled and sailed hobiecats (need to book them like a golf tee-off) and just vegged out with a book.We enjoyed the entertainment every evening our preference being the main bandstand by the ?Punta Cana? lobby bar. The ?Iberostar Friends? go out of their way to make your stay pleasant and fun so don?t miss their show in the other bar. In fact all of the staff seem dedicated to your enjoyment. I took a beginners course in conversational Spanish before we went and had my phrase book with me. Most of the staff are not strong in English and my stumbling Spanish helped. The locals really enjoy it when you use Spanish no matter how bad you are and it was just one more item that added to our enjoyment. When you consider that German, Italian and Spanish clients outnumber the English speakers you can see how adaptable they were. We even met some Belgians who spoke Flemish but their English was excellent.We will most certainly return.

<Content>Awful My Husband and I just got back from Iberostar Bavaro today and we were SOOO thrilled to get out of there! The only good thing about this place is the beach-- I have to say that the weather and the beach were great. Other than that...The Food: Inedible. We tried the restaurants (I use the term VERY loosely) and the buffets and decided to stick with the buffet because we could at least find pizza to eat. Everything was deep-fried and just disgusting. If you care about food and fine dining, do NOT go to the Iberostar. The drinks were also nasty...we stuck to beer because we couldn't get anything else down our throats. We started to joke that each meal became an episode of Fear Factor. As a New Yorker, I like good food....none to be found. Seriously-- awful.The Rooms: Gross. They don't appear to have been updated in a very long time, and they look very dated. Our room stank from must...so much so, that we were on the beach at 6:30am-6:00pm because we couldn't bear any additional time in that nasty room. They weren't the cleanest...and last night, we saw a critter scurry across the floor. Yes, la cucaracha. I wanted to vomit. Did I mention the ants on the first day? We tried to get American Airlines on the phone because we wanted to leave after one day. Yes, welcome to a cross between Jurassic Park and Survivor. The Staff  Service: The Dominican people are, for the most part, VERY nice. That being said, the staff at the Iberostar just don't get it. They do not cater to the guests in any way, and everything seems to be on Dominican time. The towel shack was supposed to open at 8am, but almost every day, the towel truck didn't arrive with fresh towels until at least 8:20am. Most don't speak any English other than a word or two, so thank goodness I remembered my high school Spanish. We tipped considerably and that helped a bit, but no one here goes the extra mile for you. If you're used to being treated a certain way and expect a high level of service, this place isn't for you. The activity staff are very enthusiastic, and I really can't say anything negative about them-- my criticism is more for the way the hotel is run. If the DR wants to emerge from being a third world country, they really need to get their act together.You should also be prepared to fend for yourself. There is no one on the beach to set up your towel/chair, and NO service on the beach! If you want to get something to drink or eat poolside, you have to go to the buffet near the pool which resembles a mess hall.The Activities: In my opinion, pure cheese. Screaming people and dancing poolside is not my idea of sophistication. Hey, maybe that's your thing. I personally find it to be low class. We were misinformed about the environment.The Bottom Line: If you're looking for a luxury resort, look elsewhere. I've never been SO happy for a vacation to end and to be on American soil. The Dominican Republic is a cheap vacation, and it appears you get what you pay for.

<Content>Overall a good time. The grounds were beautiful and clean. The rooms were very nice and clean. There were no bugs in our room at all. Air conditioning was great and no need to keep doors or windows open.The beach was great. (soft sand, calm waters, lots of beach chairs)Most (but not all) of the people working there were nice and friendly. Food was very mediocre. I was totally unimpressed by the restaurants. Might as well just stick with the buffet. But the food wasn't bad either. Just OK.The food you get for room service is not the same quality as at the buffet or restaurants. Its terrible. It is like lunch room quality at a public school. The burger I ate in my room reminded me of the murder burgers I used to get in High School.I am not an expert on liquor but I found the quality to be just fine.The pool was very nice. Clean and large.The nightly shows of dancing and singing were not top notch but still fun.The night club was small but fun. Too many teenagers for my taste but thats just me.The guests there are a mixed bag of Americans, Canadians, Britons, Spaniards, French and Germans. I stayed there with my girlfriend first week of April 2005 and we had a real fun time.

<Content>Awesome TIme!!! My husband and I went to the iberostar bavaro for a full week! we had a blast. the rooms were clean, spacious and well taken care of. The buffets were good but we preferred the restaurants- especially the steak, lobster and sushi!!! the pool and beach were wonderful - the staff at the pool and lounge bar -especially JULIO MARTIN- he took care of us- friend for life. A few $$ in american money went a long way and service was fantastic at the bars. Ask for Julio, Raphael, Lorenzo, Franscico and Salias- great hard workers!!!!

<Content>Beautiful beach at Iberostar Bavaro My husband and I spent our 17 yr anniversary at Iberostar Bavaro Apr 22-29, 2005. Every year since our marriage we have traveled during this time. We booked our trip through Apple vacations, which has directed us towards some of the best resorts in the Carribean and Mexico over the years. We were at Secrets Excellence in DR 2 yrs ago, so Iberostar had a tough act to follow, as we absolutely loved Secrets - no children, great staff, beautiful rooms, good food  drink. Although we had no serious complaints about Iberostar and we enjoyed a relaxing week in a tropical setting, here's the pluses and minuses: The lobby and grounds are truly beautiful. Flamingos, peacocks, and birds everywhere. They did a spectacular job with the lighting at night. The jr. suites are nice, and they provide a big jug of bottled water in the mini-frig. The food is good, and the freshly baked croissants are warm and tasty in the morning along with your made-to-order omelet. You must have patience, however, to wait to make reservations for dinner. It's an extremely slow process, so make them all at once. And don't forget to take the slip of paper with you to the dinner or you'll be turned away! Japanese was our favorite. The paella with lobster is the best choice in the Meditteranean restaurant. The Mexican was so-so, because the salsa tastes like pure vinegar and the air conditioning was barely working. My husband thought the nightly buffet was really great, and no reservation needed. One night they had grilled lobster, which was awesome. The casino is a fun evening option to the shows which we've grown bored with. I won $235 USD playing roulette the first night, but you do have to watch the girls closely because I caught them twice clearing the table of winning bets. The beach is one of best we've been to...soft, white sand, wide and long enough to take you as far as your legs can walk, plenty of beach chairs and palypas, and fun people watching as there is the most international crowd I've seen. Sometimes that became a negative for me, as I was craving to talk to someone who spoke English while my husband went golfing (though he enjoyed the Cocotal golf course, the prices are way overstated!). I definitely felt in the minority vs. Europeans. And it is no exageration that about 10% of the women are topless on the beach, so beware if you have impressionable children. The pool area is very nice, with one section zero depth like a beach, another over 6 ft deep, another for small children, and another for the swim-up bar. We did not spend much time at the pool bar, as the atmosphere is different when you have kids all around. And as for the drinks, I was not impressed. All the slushy tropical mixes are overly sweet, and if you forget to ask for alcohol with your daquiri or pina colada, you'll get a virgin drink. Only local booze is diplayed on the counters, and it was tough to get the premium liquor. One night I asked for Tangeray  tonic, and was told that they ran out of tangeray as well as champagne! Who is managing these bars?! Although this resort is all-inclusive, I truly felt like I got low grade liquor unless we tipped. I never experienced this at Secrets or at a Sandals resort. Also to note was that I waited til the last day to tip our maid (though she smiled genuinely and thanked me)---we did not get fresh flowers in our room each day, nor towels rolled up as decorations, like other reviewers mentioned. So, if this makes your stay, I suggest early tipping is in order at Iberostar. For these subtle differences, Secrets Excellence is a better choice in DR for adults traveling without kids, though Iberostar is a very nice resort with good things to offer.

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Loved the Bavaro wished I could of stayed a few more days. The rooms were nice no bugs and nicely furnished. We were given a king size bed as requested with a great room location right by pool and beach we really lucked out. Food at specality rest were excellent our favorites were the steak and gourmet ones. The buffets were great we had our breakfast and lunch there and we loved the paella (awesome)!!!! We also had a blast at the disco and enjoyed the shows as well. Some shows were a little cheesy but overall can't complain. It was also great that we met several other couples and we all had the best time together. The staff were so friendly and $2 goes a long way, they were very appreciative . The grounds were beautiful and everything was well maintained. We have traveled alot and this is our favorite all inclusive we would go back in a heart beat...... P.S were already checking next year to go back!!!!!!

<Content>Wonderful time at Iberostar Bavaro!!!! I have done a lot of travelling in Asia/Europe, but this was my first trip to the Caribbean and I loved it! I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from Apr. 22-27 and had a GREAT time. The facility is GORGEOUS and the grounds are spotless and well-maintained. The gardeners can constantly be seen doing upkeep about the premises. The staff were all very friendly and smiling, singing all the time as they went about their work, greeting you with HOLA. It would be nice to know some Spanish but even without knowing any you will be able to communicate. Many of the hotel staff know about 4 languages. You will be doing a lot of walking every day, as it is a large complex and you will walk some distance to go back and forth between the lobby/restaurants, your room, the beach, the pool, the water activities. You will be changing your clothes a LOT. TIPS: Be sure to bring a stack of $1 bills to give as tips. Be sure not to forget your watch (as I did) or bring an alarm clock with you as there are no clocks anywhere on the premises, and as everything operates on a time schedule, you will need to know the time in order to report to the buffet, your restaurant reservations, your activities, etc. I finally resorted to calling the telephone operator several times a day to inquire the time. Bring your own snacks if you like chips or nuts and things in your room, as they are expensive in the supermercado. You can buy great pareos, beach cover-ups, hats and so forth there. There's not much else to buy, in terms of souveneirs. I brought a single-cup coffee maker with me and didn't need to use a voltage converter for it. As the restaurant doesn't open till 7 AM it was great to be able to have a cup of coffee early in the morning, and to take a cup down to the beach. Try to tie something to the faucet so you don't forget and brush your teeth with the water.BUGS: Don't worry about mosquitos, didn't see ANY and didn't get sick at all. I did forget once and brushed my teeth with tap water -- the next day I was queasy for about 15 minutes but it passed, probably due to the tap water incident. As far as cockroaches, there were a LOT in my bathroom at night (small ones) and one GIANT cockroach in my sitting area. Although I complained to guest services, the situation did not improve. Don't let this deter you, though. I don't think that everyone had this problem. The bugs did not leave the bathroom area and I didn't take any home. Just to be on the safe side, it is a tropical country, KEEP YOUR SUITCASES CLOSED!!!FOOD: The buffet was fabulous! I'm an adventurous eater, so I tried a lot of the local food, the paella was great, as were some of the Dominican dishes, the tropical fruits, the homemade breads, the Spanish cheeses. I did see a lot of the other guests eating pretty much what they would at home, plates of spaghetti, pizza, ham and eggs. There's a great assortment to choose from, you will not be disappointed. Try to sit near the pond so you can watch the antics of the water birds -- there are pink flamingos, white egrets, ducks, etc. Although I was allowed only 2 restaurant reservations, Guest Services let me reserve for every night. The Japanese restaurant had great decor and food. The Mediterranean restaurant had wonderful appetizers and paella. The steak restaurant was not to my liking -- they had ribs, and fried onion rings, and steaks with barbecue sauce. The Gourmet restaurant was fabulous, great presentation, lobster, singers to serenade you. DRINKS: The wine in the restaurants was good and plentiful. They did not serve wine near the beach, and it was not always available at the lobby bar, so if you like wine, bring some with you. You cannot buy wine there and they won't deliver any to your room. I tried a few of the tropical drinks, and they're OK but I prefer wine. WEATHER: It rained only once, for 1/2 hour, but it was a deluge. The sun was shining brightly every day by 7:30 AM. Although the skies were overcast at times, there was plenty of sun. There was a nice breeze coming in from the ocean. It was HOT!!!, but that's the way I like it. CLOTHES: Women, unless you are very old and overweight, bring a 2-piece bathing suit or bikini. NO ONE wears one-piece bathing suits, and you can go topless on the beach if you like. Topless is not allowed at the pool, but a couple of ladies weren't obeying that rule. There's a steady stream of topless ladies strolling along the shore although most women would have looked better with their tops on. Bring lots of changes of clothes, and coverups and nice clothes for the restaurants. Men do dress up at night, in long pants and linen shirts or tropical print shirts. ACTIVITIES: There's plenty to do. I went horseback riding for 2 hours -- unless you feel comfortable galloping on the beach, don't attempt this one. There's parasailing, snorkelling, scuba diving, and plenty of excursions to sign up for. The water sports do depend on them having enough people to go, so you might not be able to go when you want to. The gym was great but not air-con, so go early or late. The jacuzzi was FABULOUS. I had a massage on the beach, which I would recommend highly. BEACH: Beach is gorgeous and is kept clean. There is a little surf, the waters are beautiful turquoise. Although it's not allowed to reserve chairs in the bamboo huts, by 8AM it was difficult to find a seat (I was a single woman) at the closest beach area. There are 4 seats to a hut there, and usually at least 2 of them had towels on them early in the morning. One day, I laid down on a vacant chair in a hut, only to be rudely accosted by an Australian guest who accused me of stealing his hut. He actually asked me to move my chair off somewhere; I felt like crying but refused and insisted I was not stealing his hut. He had his chair and I had mine and he wasn't supposed to reserve the huts anyways. I spoke to Guest Services and they told me he was wrong and that if he gave me any more trouble they would take care of it. So be prepared! There are other hut areas that have room for 2 chairs. ROOM: Apart from the bug issue, my room was beautiful. There was a peacock that came to sit on my balcony wall. My air conditioner worked so well that the first thing I did when I got to my room was to turn it off (or on as low as it would go) and I just used the ceiling fan the whole time. I was very comfortable and even had to pull the covers up to my neck every night. They will bring you plenty of bottled water. The water in the tub was nice and hot.

<Content>Not a dissappointment My wife and I checked in April 17th for 5 nights at the Iberostar Bavaro. Immediately, we were impressed with the property, our room, the pool, and the beach. So, we knew our $$ was well spent. Here are some comments: The food is your typical high volume fair. Book the specialty restuarants as they will be a nice change from the mega-buffets. If you go in the Spring, it will rain, and you may have whole days of overcast skies. Don't get excited about gambling at the this Iberostar resort, you will most likely be disappointed. Last, the high-priced excursions touted by both the represented tour companies and the Iberostar itself, are just that, high-priced excursions. Don't avoid them, just don't put your expectations to high. These are simply 4 comments to help would-be travellers, we have many many great things to say about the Bavaro as well. Service at the resort was excellent. Get to know certain staff members, tip them accordingly, and they will remember you. The rooms at the Bavaro are tastefully decorated and very comfortable. We would have given 5 Stars, but didn't feel the whole package is 5 Star rated. After all, this is a big resort, lots of people, it's sorta like a cruise ship experience, but on land. Plus, the food pulled down the rating, not because it was bad, but because it was nothing significant. Just to be fair though, we met several people who absolutely raved about the food. So, there you have it, you can decide. If you want to go the DR...Go. It is a great value! There is no disputing that. Based on what we paid, and others we met, the medium daily cost per person is well worth it.

<Content>Very Good Time My wife, four children (ages 2,5,79) and I had a great time. We returned on 4/24. The food was good to very good. The beach was wonderful but the surf was not perfectly flat as you find in Auruba or Turks. The resort exterior was prestine. The guest suites (bungalo style) were nice but could have used some upgrading. Our suite was about a half notch below what you would find at a Marriott or Weston. The service was excellent however. The staff was nice and very child friendly. The nightly shows were also enjoyable. As to illness, we didn't experience any nor did we hear of anyone getting sick. An added plus was the cultural experience of the D.R. We strongly recommend the island and resort.

<Content>I expected alot and got much less. We went as a group of eight, all friends, and had an excellent time together. Our accomodations were average, rooms were very damp and refrigerators was useless, the grounds were beautiful, the housekeepers were great. The reviews of the restraunts had our group anticipating a fine feast, the food was edible. The casino was the only game in town, be careful, we were playing roulette and the ball was stuck between two numbers for two minutes, maybe longer. Will the ball stick on the wheel that long???? Crazy!! The activities and water sports were difficult to use, we had to reserve them 1 to 2 days in advance for a hour long useage. The resort seemed to push the outside activities. I will not go again, I'll stick with Sandals in Jamacia or the Bahamas.

<Content>Clean and good service Travelled to Iberostar Bavaro family of 4 (2 boys aged 9  11) April 2-9. We had a great time at the pool and beach. Unfortunately we did not get the kingsize bed we were told by Maritime Travel was guaranteed. However. 2 3/4 beds worked out ok given we had 2 kids in the room anyhow. The daybeds are two different sizes and the shorter one was too short for my 9 year old. We ordered a cot and received a twin boxspring and mattress within an hour!We are well travelled having been to Sandals Jamaica, Westin Peurto Rico, Beaches Turks and Caicos and the Palace Barcelo Bavaro. I would say the service and food was probably better here than at the Palace.The service is excellent here. Lots of staff to clean and serve and entertain. No problems getting a chair at the pool or beach. No need to reserve them. We did not go on any excursions as the kids were happy with the beach and pool. Lots to do. Archery, water polo, chess, ping pong, shooting, shuffleboard, bingo, dancing. The mini club was more for 6yrs and under. Kids older than this were not attending. And our kids met other kids and had fun in the pool. The food was excellent. Lots to choose from and excellent quality. We should have stuck to the buffet for the sake of the kids as they did not always find something they liked on the menu. If not though we just went to the buffet after. Tons to eat there!No bugs or mosquitos to be seen. We took a chance on not taking the antimalaria and glad we did not.I woul highly recommend this resort. I don't think I would stay at the Dominician or Punta Cana sister resorts - more like hotel rooms rather than jr. suites. Also, the front desk mgt tried to tell me they did not have family rooms when I know they do because it was not only posted on their website (has since been removed) and in the brochure book in the room!! I don't mind if they tell me they are booked but don't lie to me and say they don't exist! Then when I showed him the email I received from his manager he said they were only located in the Punta Cana resort. Yeah right. A lower rated hotel has family rooms? Especially when the brochure book said they were at the Bavaro site!These were the only complaints I have though. It was immaculately clean, good service and great food!MarNova Scotia, Cda

<Content>Best Vacation of Our Lives I went to the IB Bavaro in March and I must admit I have been lazy about writing about my trip, especially since I read these posts religioulsy before I left. Maybe it is because I am so depressed to be back home! My boyfriend and I still sit and sigh about the amazing trip we had. You are going to have the most amazing time of your life. Food: AMAZING. The roasted chicken is out of this world. The drinks are excellent, especially the Banana Mama. My boyfriend liked El Presidente which is the beer there. I can't say enough about the variety and amount of food. The ice cream at La Heladeria is gross, but the machine where you make it yourself is awesome. You will never wait in line. My boyfriend and I chose to eat at the buffet a majority of the nights because it is so beautiful. Sit at the edge of the room right on the water and you will be greeted by flamingos and all sorts of birds as you eat. Amazing. Make sure to meet the Pasta guy at the main buffet. You can make your own pasta with any topping you can think of. SO GREAT. Also, make sure your always fully dressed (not just a shirt over your bathing suit) I forgot shorts my last day and was asked to put on a pair. No big deal.People: The nicest people you will ever meet. I swear. I heard everyone say this before I went and when I got there I was still blown away. At the main desk I tried in horrible spanish to get information on my room and the guy started laughing at me and said I speak english. Bartenders are great, waitresses are great, the maids are exquisite if you tip well. The Star Friends are excellent people who try throughout the day to get you involved in all the activites, and it works! Don't be afraid to get up and dance! I'm 21 and found myself dancing with 70 year olds!Room: Beautiful. The hairdryer is very weak, pack your own if you want to use it. Room service is so fast! We got it our first night there since we were so tired and it came right away. Very clean, very spacious. If your nice to the guys at the front desk, expect to be upgraded to an ocean room. DO NOT DRINK THE WATER! Keep your mouth closed in the shower, brush your teeth with bottle water, and rinse your tooth brush off with bottled water as well. You get a huge tub of water in your room, and you can request more if you need it. It was just beautiful. And for the guys, don't worry, the tv gets ESPN.Beach: We had to get up early to hold a chair in the front row of the beach. If your not particular about where your chair is, there are always some available. Water is great. So warm! We bought a floating raft at the store in the lobby for about 6 bucks and you could just float in the water. It was so relaxing. If you are afraid of fish, even the nice ones like I am, they will swim around you in the water, no matter how shallow you are. They go with the flow of the waves so they sometimes bump right into you. My boyfriend loved it, but I stayed on my raft. =) Beach sand is totally clean, although there were some patches of seaweed in the water.The Shops: If you go with baseball team stuff, you can get anything for free. Especially Pedro Martinez gear, red sox, yankees, etc. The jewlery is great, everything else I found a little crazy. On your walk there you will see little puppies lying on the beach full of sand. Bring them water and meats from the buffet! They love it! They are friendly, dont worry.The Spa: Get a massage, totally worth it. I would get one around 5 or 6pm because they are right on the beach and you have to strip down in the open air. Very liberating, but go when no one is on the beach. I got a manicure which was ok, but I desperately needed one. For all the ladies getting a manicure before you leave, I would not. I went with light pink polish and the ocean and pool turned it bright yellow! gross! I got my manicure at the spa and got a bright pink color and the water turned it orange! I would wait to get one your last day there.The grounds: Spectacular. The peacocks are awesome, you can feed them from your hand. Everything is so clean, they grounds keepers chop down things that have a speck of brown on them, or that they think will go bad soon. If your walking around at night, and your feet are tired, they normally have guys in golf carts that will take you back to your place. Don't be afraid to ask them for a ride, just tip.Entertainment: The shows at night I thought were great. The dancing was out of control, talk about 6 pack abs on every dancer. I recommend doing karaoke for a good laugh. I would stay at the resort at all times. I went on the party boat and it stunk. Don't waste your time, enjoy the resort. Plus, the buses are always late.Money: If you want the best service, bring atleast 100 singles to tip. We used all our singles and we wish we had more. After you meet the people, you will want to tip them.Bring a spanish dictionary! I wrote notes to my maid everyday which I could not do without that book! Wear sunscreen at all times and reapply every 45 minutes. I am queen of being tan and I wore 30 and came home very very tan. Tons of cool stuff in the shops for not a bad price. The only expensive stuff are the things you need: sunscreen, food, saniatary napkins, etc. Any questions you can email me. You will have an amazing time. It was the best week of my life!Jenna

<Content>The best chain of resorts! I was just tooling around on this website looking up information on another vactaion destination and happened upon this one because we loved this resort! The service was incredible and the food was great! The resort chain itself we have been to 3 previous times and we recommend this to all of our friends! We travel a lot and have for years! This place is a fun and beautiful resort and the Dominican is like no other! The negative reviews have to be from people who have never traveled to countries that are socioeconomically hurting! This industry never showed it though! The water no one should ever drink! if people did not know that coming into their trips then their travel advisor did a serious diservice to them. This should not be taken out on the people that live there nor on the resort chain itself. It was beautiful and wonderfully run compared to many resorts chains we have been to including Sandals, Club Med and BEaches. Go and enjoy! And if you can take a stop at Captain COoks for a beach side dinner of the local fresh fish with a few Coronas you will love it!

<Content>Average Resort This is your typical run of the mill resort. I was expecting more excursions and things to do, although the resort didn't have a whole lot to offer. Keep in mind this resort is HUGE. I had quite a few blisters on my feet from walking so darn much. Oh, and don't let them fool you. I was told prior to booking this trip that they do not have beach front rooms, which was a total lie. We slipped reception a $50.00 bill and got a room on the beach which was very pleasant. As for the nightlife, there is not much. The discos are invaded by locals and the shows are ridiculous, geared more for kids. Oh, and I would like to add that the beach was great although the pool was not. About 3 pm everyday the pool is invaded by locals. I was told that the staff lives there at the resort and when the kids are released from school; they have access to the pools. I was very disappointed by this; it was extremely hard to relax while a minimum of 15 children horsing around at the pool without parent supervision. All in all, our trip was average. I don't recommend this resort to singles or couples looking for relaxation.

<Content>Don't believe any bad review of this hotel! This was our 2nd time at this resort. The food ,service and staff are great! The beach is to die for and the rooms are spotless. When you read these reviews remember that some people are hard to please. Most of these reviews are very good and are true!!! People forget that the change of food, alot sun and good drinks during the day may cause you to get sick or feel like CRAP! So they blame the resort. Oh and when people say that it's a poor country that they are appalled, most islands are poor. Do your homework! The dominicans are nice people. We have been to the Dominican 6 times in the past 6 years and never get sick (take it slow for the first day or two). We love the Iberostar chain. Next year we would like to try the Ibero Costa Dorada. Again the reviews are also good for that resort. we have also been to the Ibero In La romana ( the Hacienda Dominicus) and love it there also. So take it slow and enjoy!

<Content>Awesome, except for I can't say enough on how great this wacation was. My wife and I were expecting the worst but very surprised and even impressed of the quality that this people give. Except for some, extremely unpleasant individuals that we encountered , coincidentally they are mostly from South Joyzzzzeee.(What a surprise?)Tried way to hard to represent the US, as if they came there just to do that.Do us all a favor,don't!Don't worry be happy!*****The resort was beautiful , and clean. I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't hurt my shoulder from horsing around in the water with my wife.*****I drank the water from the restaurant every single day. Maybe, I just have a great immune system.*****The food was excellent,excellent except for their Sushi. What can I tell yah but hey, they tried.*****Clean,Clean,Clean*****The shows were amazing. Make sure you go to the shows not to be mistaken for the opening acts.*****You don't have to tip. I tip just because I wanted to and used to tipping.*****Dance, you will not be judge on how good you dance.They love seeing you having a good time. *****Go get a massage with Marcel at the spa in Dominica hotel,he is fantastic.*****They have a nice little cozy casino.*****Everyone is awesome ,but look for the Iberostar entertainers/host.You will have 100x the fun.*****The Drinks were great!!! I liked their Pina Colada,Coco-loco,and Bananamama. *****Make sure you see your travel rep. They can be of great help.Great activities*****The staff, don't be afraid to talk to them or get to know them. They are so friendly and you feel the sincerity.(Takes a little getting used to).

<Content>Dangerous and Deadly We just returned from Punta Cana, Domincan Republic, and we stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro Resort. The following list can assist you when planning your vacation. My husband and I went to Punta Cana to see a friend's wedding and we stayed for 5 days. Arrival  Bus Ride to Iberostar:The arrival to the airport was neat, there were beach huts and open air breezeways to walk through. You will have to purchase a visa to enter the country for 10 dollars. ( American) Make sure that before you leave you take enough American dollars to tip and have with you for travelling purposes. If you are an American citizen, make sure to have your passport and birth certificate. I saw a couple that could not leave and board their flight because they did not have their passports. Make sure to register your travel with the American Embassy should anything happen while you are there. The bus ride to the resorts was quite terrifying, the poverty level is extremely high in this country. We saw several people walking the streets with machine guns and prostitutes all over the streets. It was really quite depressing to see this first hand, not a nice way to start your vacation. Before you leave, make sure to see your doctor and get anti-malarial medication. It is not worth the risk of malaria infection. Iberostar Bavaro Resort:This resort is a 5 star resort, but if you are an American and are used to travelling to real 5 star resorts, you will be unimpressed. The food was horrible, and plan to be hungry throughout your trip. I read all the reviews about this resort, and I am shocked to believe that people actually found the food to be appetizing. There are buffets that are open throughout the day, but again to find anything really appealing is a surprise. You can make reservations to restaurants but have to do so before 12:00 that day. My husband and I arrived at 12:05 to make a reservation and were told to come back at 3:00. All the restaurant were booked at that point. Be careful what you eat and drink here. Do NOT eat fruits and vegetables unless you wash and peel them. DO NOT DRINK THE WATER! EVER. There is bottled water for you to brush your teeth with and to drink. Do NOT LEAVE the resort area, it is by far too risky. I was more guarded about what I ate, but my husband ate a variety of foods and became so ill one day that he vomited over 6 times. Bring Pepto Bismal and Immodium to control the vomiting and nausea that will surely come. If you are an American, you will not like the food, we are far too spoiled here. If you are European, you may not mind the food. Beach:The beach is beautiful, just make sure to stay at the Bavaro. The beaches in front of the other resorts are too crowded. There are many Europeans and Canadians here, so the topless sunbathing is the norm. Many who should not even have a suit on, let alone be topless. There is snorkeling and kayaking which is fun, along with many other beach activities. The sand is soft, you may want to bring reef shoes because certain parts in the ocean have coral. Entertainment:The shows are not worth it, you can find other things to do here beyond watching the cheesy shows. I realize that these people work hard at the resorts, but I had a horrible time here. Please be aware- you have been warned!

<Content>Wonderful Experience We stayed at Iberostar Bavaro the wk of Apr 3 -10, 2005, and can honestly tell You that everything at this resort would be rated either a 4 or 5 star experience. Upon first arrival at the airport it was pretty quick getting the shuttle to the resorts, about a 25 minute ride, the shuttle buses were all in pretty good shape, and airconditioned. Checking in was fast, with a welcome tropical drink, and friendly, smiling faces that greet You. The jr. suite was very nice, very clean, and kept up very everyday by the maid service, (always a good idea to leave a dollar or two tip), they do go the extra mile to please with decorative towels in the shape of a swan, topped off with the local flowers. We found the food at all the restaraunts to be very good, one will never go hungry at this resort, from morning through evening. Neither one of Us ever felt any illness, and we ate anything with no exceptions, was told that all foods are washed in this resort's purified water, not tap water, which should be avoided. The entire grounds here from the pool to the restaraunts to the marvelous beach are kept very clean on a daily basis, even the beach with it's little amount of seaweed, is raked, and picked up every day! As for shopping, visit the local vendors market on the beach, they will make a deal with You, and You will get a good price for whatever You may want to purchase, (great buys on cigars, shirts, rum, and local jewelry). The beach here is Great, clean soft sand, and the water is just plain Wonderful! The nightly entertainment consists of a lot of high energy dancing by the troupe, with some great colorful native costume wear, very entertaining, and a lot of fun! The entire staff at Iberostar Bavaro is very friendly, and helpful, many love to sing, and dance a little as they perform their regular duties. Please remember that We are visiting their country, and be as courteous as possible, we did experience a few visitors that were sometimes rude, that only reflects on the rest of US. We would highly recommend Iberostar Bavaro, to all who are looking for a truly Wonderful, relaxing vacation, as We hope to revisit sometime later this year, ourselves. Enjoyed everything about this resort!

<Content>Nice hotel-no complaints  Just returned from 7 nights at the Iberostar Bavaro with wife and children (ages 2 and 4) on April 9.Random thoughts: Nice hotel, grounds and beach. Did not take malaria medication and seldom used bug spray. We saw NO MISQUOTES and had no insect bites.The property is very large (perhaps too large), and many rooms are far from the pool and beach. The beach is lovely, and it is necessary to reserve chairs early if seeking shade. The pool is large and somewhat dated, but no complaints.Do not worry about internet weather forecasts--they are wrong. The weather is hot and humid, with a strong breeze most days coming off of the water.Food is fine. We generally avoid all inclusive resorts, but AI is the way to go in Bavaro. Most hotels in the area are AI, and there are few off site places to go. DO NOT DRINK TAP WATER. Everything at Iberostar is washed/cooked with bottled water, and we did not get sick. We had no problems with the ice, friuits, vegetables, etc. We called the front desk to ask for more water for the minibar so that we could use it to brush, and they brought us a gallon bottle of water each day thereafter.Specialty restaurants are a joke. If you want Japanese food or real steaks, eat at home. The appetizer buffet at the Mediterranean restaurant was the best specialty offering. The paella served at lunch near the beach was the best meal of the trip. Better liquor is available in the lobby bar. Ask for something if you do not see it displayed. They hide the goodies. TIP your bartenders, waiters and house keepers generously--they need the money--and will go out of there way to help you.The rooms smelled of mildew, and everything must be laundered upon our return home.The hotel is not a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton. The Iberostar Bavaro is a nice 3 star hotel. The staff is nice and always smiling. TIP THEM.

<Content>Beautiful property We visited the Iberostar Bavaro 19/3/05-26/3/05. We had booked at the Princess but got bumped to here. I was excited to stay here since out last two trips were to Playa del Carmen at the Lindo. Upon check-in we went to our room and found two beds:( . We went back to the front desk and were told we could move to a room with a king the next day. That was fine. We went to get out the bascis and found we needed a converter which they didn't sell in the gift shop. They had the ones to convert from 110 but not the other way. We brought a utility tool so my husband cut off the sides of the plug on my hair dryer. The a/c is this room was ok and we were comfortable that night. We finally got moved about 3:00 the next day. This room had upgraded plugs and a much cleaner bathroom. The a/c was also far better than the first room. Our alarm clock (which, if you want one you will need to bring it with you) has the temp. Our first room got down to 73 at night, the second ont got down to 68 each night. It wasn't that the first bathroom was dirty, just old and the tub was scuffed from years of sand and such. It was clean but didn't look it. The weather was perfect, the beaches beautiful, grounds lush and beautiful. The staff friendly helpful and hard working. The food was just ok, mind you we have been to the Iberostar Paraiso Londo so that is what I am comparing to. I heard several people asking where is the American food. Wake up travelers, the American food is in America. If that is what you want, stay home! Give the rest of us a break from listening to you complain. I did find it strange that there was not ful bar service in the resturaunts. I had a very hard time getting drinks. Even ordering them in Spanish didn't help. They have to go to the main bar to get drinks for you so if you want one you need to order right away. You may get it by the time you get your main course. The Mexican resturaunt is hard to find, you have to go inside the buffett of the Dominica to get there, and we were told no vodka when we asked for a drink. The a/c was not working that night or the next three. There was also no music so we got to listen to dishes being clattered around in the kitchen. Not very much fun... I was expecting a much better dining experience since the Mexican at the Lindo was out of this world. We have been to DR once before so we knew there was no shopping to speak of. We went knowing it would be a week of beach or pool being the hardest decision we made each day. Ladies, those of you who choose to sunbath topless, point of info, it is acceptable to do this but put your top on when you get off your chair for a stroll on the beach or a romp in the ocean. The paint on the bottom of the pool was pealing, badly. I have no earthly idea how they would drain it, paint it and refill it without a huge impact on the guests. The last two days of our stay we couldn't even get into the pool because of kids. It was like a neighborhood pool at the beginning of summer. Same with the swim up bar. There were kids lined up on the seats. It was a shame that this kept lots of adults out of the pool. Parents, I have two words for youKIDS CLUB , use it.

<Content>Trip was great! Just got back from a great trip to Punta Cana Iberostar Bavaro. Rooms were good. All junior suites. Staff works their tails off! Food was good. Did not get sick AT ALL. Husband, myself and three kids all took an acidophilus each day per our pediatricians advice and were just fine! (First thing I did when getting into suite was to put a rubber band around the faucet so kids weren't even tempted!) They provide an enormous amount of bottled water. The staff LOVES Americans because we tip. Apparently some people take all inclusive to mean literally everything is free. A few dollars goes an enormous way. One day we tipped the buffet server a few dollars and he tracked us down to thank us! Iberostar does a nice job with activities for kids. Absolutely no problem getting seats at the pool, and this was a double whammy travel week (spring break and holy week!) Unlike the Atlantis in the Bahamas, no need to get up at 5 a.m. for a seat! Beaches are beautiful and very close to the pool. Food was good. Not gourmet, but hey, it's a resort! Very relaxing. Kids loved the peacocks roaming the hotel. Saw a grand total of 2 mosquitoes the entire time I was there. Our group did not take malaria medication. Seemed as if it was split down the middle as far as who did and did not. Prices are good. Massages on the beach as low as $25 per 1/2 hour. Good water sports. Only downside was no waverunners, which my kids love, but they went tandem parasailing instead. All said, if you asked me if I would go back to DR, the answer would be yes. (Bahamas, NO!) Keep in mind that there is really very little shopping and no town to speak of, but my kids hate that stuff, anyways! We did do one of the snorkel trips (half day) and swam with nurse sharks and sting rays. Very cool!

<Content>If you wish some Total Rebirth, get there!! Hi, I was living in Belgium and chose this hotel because the beautiful natural park. When i arrived to this hotel, i was lost for words for Peace and Harmony is what i felt. I loved the room so spacious, all so clean, the marble so shining. Food is not at at all fatty and i wish all people on earth could eat so well... Service room was amazing. I happened to give some linen cloth for laundry....i got it back brand new (i once asked the same service in Spain.....they told me they wouldn't take the risk of ironing linen....jesus). Service Room Staff were friendlly, quick and professional. I felt REAL at home. I spoke with the Dominican Staff (i noticed Spanish europeans were treating them a bit too arrogantly. A man(groom) told me they earn 150 dollars/a month . More than in India but still, i think they could earn much more for all the work they do. It was in 96. I read reviews on this site about some hotels. I visited some hotels with a friend and frankly i preferred mine, but all were nice. I never was disappointed by IBerostar in Spain or Canary Islands. And believe me, Food is amazing. I never got such delicious food in Europe . Simply because people are definitely not tidy enough in handling food.....and Dominicans are always clean. I found nothing to critize except that grooms and cleaning ladies were really working hard for little money...so i tried to give them tips whenever i could. For i went to visit their homes...and i was dismayed to see, this island is experiencing massive tourism but unable to allow all basic things as a fridge...The home i visited had not even current water. So when a Dominican tells you we are happy to see tourists for we couldn't live without them and we treat them as Kings and Queens it is not a fairy tale. It is just true. They are real friendly people with dignity. Wish all people i meet here were as professional and grateful.Oh well yes i found the Park was sometimes not properly taking care of some animals but well...i guess all staff was too busy with people.Mary from Balearic Islands

<Content>Great place... lots of food, but too fatty! We just got back on Saturday 3/26/05. Very nice place. People are nice, and the beach and pool are definatly nice. The food is good, but is has a wierd taste too it. Lobster at the gormet rest is great, and the japanese rest is good. Buffets were pretty good, but I swear they cook everything in fat. Here is my biggest gripe. There was beautiful shrimp everywhere I looked, but there was no cocktail sauce to be found anywhere... it was killing me. I would have brought some with me if I could go back. I dove on the atlantic side twice and on the caribean side for 2 dives. The caribean side was unreal. visability was horrible on the atlanitic side, but the wreck there was really neat... HUGE!I would go back for sure. great place for family, not great if you are a sping breaker. Entertainment was actually good, and the service was really good! Franklin at the main bar up front was a stud. I golfed at one of the newer golf course... I cannot remeber which one.. 20 mins fromt he hotel.. it was nice, but the staff was not. Punta something...Overall we had a blast, and I would go back,,, but I like to do different things... so i probably will not.

<Content>Traveling With Teens Just returned from Punta Cana. Traveled with husband and 2 teens, aged 13  15. We loved the resort. Beautiful  peaceful, perfect weather, good food.The kids could have used more activities, but we took them to this resort so they would not be around the typical Spring Breakers.My only note would be do NOT take any of the excursions offered. We went on the Catamaran ride, and the entire trip (from hotel to hotel) lasted 12 hours!We were going to swim with the dolphins, but found out that a 6 hour excursion resulted in less than 1 minute with a dolphin--and it was at a zoo, not in the ocean.Go to the resort - and stay there.No one got sick or hurt (except for some sunburn).

<Content>Parents, 2 Highschool Age children, Loved everything about DR Our family was at the Iberostar Bavaro the week of March 18-25th. We have been to Cancun, Cozumel, Antigua, Bahamas, and this was our favorite spot. After reading all the comments I thought I would write and give our perspective compared to all the above Islands.This was truly beautiful.The resort, beach, pool, food, and room were all great. What makes the Iberostar Bavaro stand out is the staff. From the wait staff, pool staff, enterainment staff, housekeeping...all were willing and wanted to do anything they could to make your week as pleasant as possible.I have never seen a entire hotel staff this pleasant.One word on bugs and malaria. First off we saw no bugs. But, I will have to say working in the medical field I did put my family on anti-malaria medication. It is a detail. TaKE IT. You will feel more comfartable and its 1 pill 1xweek for 6 weeks. The CDC in Atlanta recommends itl So why not?We went down with Apple Vacation. The flight, check in, transfers, and tours were excellent. We took the Outback Safari for the day. It was truly the best tour I have been on. We boarded a large jeep and went out in to the middle of the country. We saw a country school, home, and various samll towns. up in the mountains. We then had lunch and surfed on the most beautiful private beach with unbelievable hugh waves. My 16yr. old son loved it. You will truly get a feel of true DR.The food was excellent at all the rest. and the buffet.The room was pleasant. Alittle small but very nice. Our maid restocked the refrig. every day with plenty of water. Yes its true only drink bottled water and brush your teeth with bottled water. Tip: So the kids wouldn't forget I tied a washcloth over the BR faucet. I tipped the maid every day.Beach-beautiful, warm,,,,,Pool-beautiful, lots of chairs, ......Lobby-beautiful......Telephone Service: This is an area that truly has been a problem for many that i would Like to clear up.l If you purchase calling cards in an amount of money, ( ex. $50.00 worth of time in the states) it is worth 140 minutes. My husband had to call back to the states due to work for a few hours a day. It occurred with no problems if you had this calling card. If not, and just called back on your VISA or collect it was truly 2-3$ minute. Buy calling cards before you leave. Also Fax to the hotel was great. My husband received faxes every day without a problem.Service_ room service was delivered in about 5 minutes. Delicious, Hot Our room safe was not working and when we called the front desk they sent someone in about 2-3 minutes.So, Pack you bags, suntan lotion, and you wlll love it.

<Content>A wonderful resort We just spent 8 wonderful days in the suites-only Iberostar Bavaro. The suites are gorgeous, the grounds are beautiful (and wonderfully maintained) and the food is superb! The speciality restaurants we experienced were merely good but the bounteous banquet of delicacies available at every day's buffet was as good or better than any buffet we have ever experienced anywhere. The staff was uniformly friendly--indeed, the friendliest resort staff we have ever experienced. Some slight negatives which prevent a perfect score for this marvelous resort: there are occasional misunderstandings due to language difficulties. For example, I asked an employee if the snorkel equipment was on the boat we were about to take to a reef for snorkeling and he said, yes. Well, when we got to the reef, we discovered that there was no equipment on board. We were supposed to have gotten it from the staff before we boarded. Later, when I called this to the attention of a more fluent staffmember, she told me that those people didn't speak any English and should not have said yes to anything asked in English. (I was offered another trip along with humble apologies). The nightly entertainment leaves much to be desired. Some of the dancing and singing was entertaining but there is a woman who presides over the audience participation programs that has a terribly irrititating voice and manner and who, although she speaks much English, is incomprehensible because she yells into the mike which she holds next to her mouth. The audience participation programs are also silly and boring. Finally, they need to hand out a brochure that explains the many dining and recreational opportunities at the resort (and its cousins, the Punta Cana and the Dominica). We had to ask too many people too many questions and may have never learned of something we would have liked to do (and which may even have been included, as so much is).Despite these reservations, this was the best resort we have ever been to and we can hardly wait to go back!

<Content>Great Family Vacation Spot We just spent six days at the Iberostar Bavaro Resort in Punta Cana. This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic. We travelled with our 2 girls, ages 10 and 7. All four of us loved this all-inclusive resort. Most notable was the staff. We have been to many Carribean resorts and the staff at the Bavaro was by far the friendliest, most accomodating we have ever encountered. Hotel is beautiful with many open air areas including the lobby, some restaurants and the night time entertainment areas. There are magnificent birds on the property including pink flamingos and peacocks. The food was excellent. Although not 5 star gourmet, the a la carte restaurant choices were all very good. The buffet was plentiful and beautifully presented. The hotel has a nice size pool but it was not elaborate. Don't expect waterfalls and slides. There is a swim up bar which was adequate. You have access to the pools at the Iberostar hotel next door which is bigger than the Bavaro pool. The beach was tremendous. It was big and clean. Note there are many Europeans at the hotel so there was some topless sunbathing. The rooms were reasonably good size with comfortable sleeping for 4. Housekeeping did a notable job. This is a great family resort with few flaws. We would have liked a better kids program especially for our 10 year old. However the lack of one made for more quality family time.

<Content>great time had by all We visited DR March 13-18 and had an outstanding time (ages 45,43,19,19). This was our first visit there. We wanted to go somewhere away from spring breakers and the Iberostar was the place, although I will say at the airport I saw a lot of college-aged kids, I imagine staying at less expensive resorts. The Iberostar was just awesome. We have done a lot of AC in Mexico, always at least a 5*, but this was probably the nicest AC resort we have been. You arrive to a HUGE open air lobby, all very new-looking, nicely furnished. Check-in was a breeze, we requested two rooms in the same bungalow ahead of time and it was taken care of. Rooms were quite spacious and all were jr. suites. Large marble bathroom w/ bidet. Of note, for some reason they don't give our washclothes. You can either bring them from home, or I pilfered some from the restroom at one of the sit-down restaurants as they used them there to dry hands. Rooms didn't smell, no bugs. Minibar was full of drinks, including plenty of bottled water. We had a bottle of rum waiting for us in our room and fruit tray, but the other party in our group did not in their room. The TV has plenty of channels, after a day on the beach you can easily catch up on world news. The beach is spectacular with plenty of palapas..I have never seen this many palapas at any resort. Go out at 9-10 AM and most will be reserved but there are still plenty. Water is beautiful. I thought it was a little cool, but then again, I am from Texas and if it isn't at least 82掳, it is cold. The pool is huge with a lot of activity going on, pool water was warmer than sea. Monday at lunch there was a merengue band playing and it was fun. Everyone was dancing and there is always an Iberostar worker willing to dance the merengue! However, we never saw a band again the rest of our stay..too bad. For an AC, the food was pretty good. Anyone who has done an AC pretty much knows what to expect, for those who have not, don't set your expectations too high. However, there were plenty of choices and something for everyone. I strongly recommend the sit-down restaurants for dinner, the quality of food is much better and you will have a blast with your waiter! Our favorite was a toss up between the lobster restaurant and the Japanese. The Mediterranean was also good, but 2 out of 4 of us had dishes there were pretty bland. There are plenty of bars..get to know the bartenders, talk to them, tip them. FYI, you can get espresso and capuccino at the lobby bar. Coffee is grown in the DR and it is great. I would say the one thing that stood out the most about this trip was the Dominican people. This is one poor country as evidenced by the drive from the airport, but the people are always happy, smiling, joking, dancing, in a word...FUN!! The resort itself is huge as it ties in with two other Iberstar resorts..the Dominicana and Punta Cana. They all share the same disco and casino. The disco was actually quite fun and drew a large crowd. There is a merengue contest most every night. Next to that is a sports bar that is huge. They do karaoke from 10-12 nightly. When the karaoke is over, the crowd moves next door to the disco. I used the gym one day. It is on the 2nd floor of the spa, no AC, no fans..I recommend going late in the day, but they do close at 7. It was adequate enough, equipment a little dated. I like the fact that there were a lot of Europeans, Canadians, etc. It made the sports bar and disco more fun...everyone seems pretty amenable to striking up a conversation. We didn't do any excursions, in fact we never left the resort. I would say the one drawback to Punta Cana is the fact that you really don't want to leave the resort. It is not like Cancun where you can go roam around, however, it can probably be compared to Cancun 20 years ago. There are no restaurants to go out to, hence, that is why all the resorts are AC. I would imagine in several more years Punta Cana will be more developed. Our ride to the airport was 2 PM and we didn't have to check out until then. Get to know the front desk manager, talk to them, etc. They are more than accomodating. All in all, this resort was outstanding, and the bottom line is I would return and would certainly recommend it. This resort is very detail-oriented I think because you don't venture out. We compared it to being on a cruise.... kind of self-contained, but we loved it. Europeans were visiting anywhere from 2-4 weeks. I honestly don't see how, I would get a little stir crazy. I know I left out a lot of details, but feel free to e-mail me with any questions.

<Content>Amazing!! Just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro. What an amazing vacation! Travelled with four families. Eight kids between us. Aged 6 to 12yrs.Half my luggage was taken up by pharmaceutical supplies, which I`m happy to say I did not need. No mosquitoes, no stomach problems. Everyone was healthy throughout the entire stay. Food is excellent. Lots to choose from Japanese restaurant is fantastic! Weather was perfect. Mid 80`s every day.Took a couple of sweaters, didn`t need them. Did not find it cool at night at all. The staff are great. Don`t know where they get the energy. Always cheerful (with the odd exception, our maid was non too friendly. in spite of daily tipping) Took a couple of insulated mugs - didn`t use those either. A waiter on the beach (Joel) took good care of us. We tipped him well and he was always bringing us cold drinks. Beach is gorgeous. The one thing we took that did get constant use were some inflatable tubes. The kids used them constantly in the ocean (We gave them to an arriving family when we left). Kids really enjoyed the swim up bar. Chocolate monkeys were a big hit. Grounds are just beautiful. Immaculately kept. Lots of wildlife to be seen.The kids did go to the mini club a few times and enjoyed it. The girls working there are great. Our older girls really enjoyed doing the kids shows at night. My daughter did a stint as Sandra Dee in Grease and had a blast! The adult shows start around 9:30pm and are entertaing but a bit raunchy for kids. Tip - do not volunteer for best couple game if you are wearing a dress ladies!!!Junior suites are nice. Living area has trundle bed under couch and when you take pillows off couch it also makes a great kid bed. We had four rooms on ground floor of same block. Had no problem with ground floor. They were great. No bugs to be seen. Our rooms had adjoining doors, which was great for the kids. They did lots of sleepovers between the four rooms.We will definately go back to an Iberostar resort. Would highly recommend this resort. The Dominican people are so nice.

<Content>The real scoop Stayed 17-24Feb05, arrived on Funjet (United Airlines) from Chicago no problems. Have 10 dollars cash at airport for entry fee per person, you will fill out card at airport desk not on the plane. Have porter take bags to transport bus, give a couple dollars. He knows where he's going. 40 minutes from airport to hotel. Check in and ask for a room near the pool/beach, they will check for you. Then ask where the restaurant reservation desk is at, just 15 steps from check-in desk. Get restaurant info page and select a restaurant and time for each night, you can get six or seven nights just ask. I have no info on pool area since we were at the beach every day. No problems with getting a shaded palapa. Go to the non-motorized hut on the beach near the Dominican Hotel side and reserve your free catamaran, wind surf and other activities. They let you reserve for two days in a row then you have to reserve for another two. Try the catamaran, it's a blast. Take all the basics, the on- site stores are way overpriced. Example: one tube of sunblock, $$20 DOLLARS. We tipped the maid and got whatever we wanted for the minifridge and extra bottled water. Ask for the good liquor at the bar they might have what you want. Go easy on the dairy products and don't overindulge. We never got sick. No mosquitos sighted or felt. The service can't be compared to a Mexican resort, I don't know why. Still the workers are friendly. Don't use the hotel long distance service instead buy phone cards at the airport because the hotel does not sell any. If you have an email account try the internet cafe by the cigar store, they charge three dollars for thirty minutes. All in all the weather was great and we had a great time. Would definitely go back again.

<Content>Loved Punta Cana This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic. Everyone was wonderful. We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro and it was very clean. Fresh flowers in our room everyday. We definitely will go back. No bugs. No stomach problems.The food was better than I thought it was going to be. The food on the buffet was always fresh.The beach was beautiful.

<Content>Fantastic Resort Pictures available at: -----------------------------We were at the Iberostar Bavaro from 2/20 鈥?2/27, 2005. My wife and I traveled with her sister and her husband (we are in our early 50鈥檚) along with their two mid-twenties daughters. In one word the resort is 鈥淎WESOME鈥? Having been at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace three years ago, we were a little apprehensive of changing resorts since we had such a good experience there. Our fears were relieved soon after we arrived as found a beautiful resort with great amenities and a hardworking and friendly staff. I highly recommend this resort.Arrival: Drove to Toronto Canada on Saturday. We stayed overnight at the Marriott Toronto Airport. Their park and fly program allows you to park in their underground garage for the week you are away and offers free shuttles to the airport. I recommend this hotel for this. We flew out of Toronto on Sunday at 4:30 pm on Sky Service (Squish-Service). This is one of the bad parts of our trip as we were originally scheduled for a 6:00 am flight only to have it changed two weeks before we left. This changed our return flight out of Punta Cana to 10:30 pm causing us to have to take Monday off as vacation also. We had originally scheduled a Saturday-to-Saturday charter but changed it to Sunday in order to get the 6:00 am flight instead of the afternoon flight. The silver lining in this hassle was that we heard that the weather on our arrival weekend was not very good, while the weather on the return weekend was gorgeous. We arrived in Punta Cana airport right on time at 9:30 pm, got through customs and found our Signature travel bus. The ride to the Iberostar took about 35 minutes. It was really bumpy and the bus creaked and groaned a lot. I thought for sure it would break down. More on that later. We got to the Hotel about 11:00 pm. Check in was smooth. We labeled our luggage with our room number and went off to get much needed Pina Colodas. Our room was #2397 and was very close to the pool and beach. This is the area you want to stay as far as I am concerned. When we checked in, Pierre at the front desk told us that if we didn鈥檛 like our room he would try to change it the next day. We liked our room but met others that didn鈥檛 and then had been moved on request. The room had a large King Bed and marble bathroom, (Hint: This is where the bottle opener is located on the wall below the light switch). The balcony was large with a couch large enough for two people to sit and room to bring out another chair. If you leave the sliding door open it shuts off the air conditioner. We were on the second floor. I think this is more desirable then the first floor. Also there was a little musty smell when we first got there, but a couple of scented candles took care of that fast. We ate at three of the ALA Carte restaurants: In order to get the times you want, make sure that you make your reservations as soon as you arrive or the next day at the latest. You can get into almost any of the ALA Cartes the day of, but you will probably be limited to 8:45 or 9:00 pm.Mediterranean: The food was good here but it wasn鈥檛 our cup of tea. Look at the menu before making reservations (My mistake). It is a Seafood restaurant and that does not imply much shellfish. If you like Red Snapper, Sea Bass, Grouper, then you will like this restaurant. The ambience was very nice hereMexican: This is located over in the Punta Cana Resort. The food was excellent here. The appetizer buffet is a meal in itself. The only little issue is this restaurant is not air-conditioned and it was a little warm. We sat by the entrance door and found that it was a little cooler up by the buffet.Gourmet: I enjoyed the meal, but not everyone in our group was in agreement. This is a fixed menu five-course dinner. 1.Smoked Salmon2.Fish Bisque3.Something I don鈥檛 remember maybe a shrimp salad4.Grilled Lobster5.Chocolate DesertAgain this restaurant had a very nice ambience and the service at all three was very good.The restaurant at the pool (which turns into the Steakhouse at night) is excellent. It opens around 10:00 am with breakfast and then at noon to about 6:00 pm it is serving all kinds of food (steak, pork chops, hots, hamburgs, chicken, sandwiches, salad, pizza, seafood). Also they have self-serve stations for soda, water, ice, coffee and ice creamWe did go to the casino, lost $20 in slots and won $75 playing Blackjack. Watch the dealers as they miscount sometimes. I do not think it was on purpose and they apologized the two times it happened.The Star Rock caf茅 was fun. They had karaoke. Which turns into a bar sing along when a well-known song is played (i.e. Margaretville, American Pie, etc).The beach vendors are located down the beach on the right. Bargaining is a social thing for them. I wouldn鈥檛 pay more than half of what they are asking. You can drive a better bargain if you want, but these guys are just trying to survive ands what鈥檚 the cost of a couple more bucks in the grand scheme of things. We didn鈥檛 do much the week we were there, no excursions or anything. It was just a week of relaxing and partying and a good way to erase work from your mind. We took many a walk on the long beautiful beach. The beach bar at the right end of the resort is good launch place for a walk (fill up the insulted mug) along with a place to stop on your way back (re-fill and a sandwich). I have only two very minor complaints about the resort1.No coffeemakers or clocks in the room. I did find that I only needed about 1陆 cups of coffee a day since it was so strong. My first morning I had a little stomach distress due to the strong black coffee on an empty stomach. I learned that I had better eat something with my first cup. My niece joked that she thought there was 鈥淐rack鈥?in the coffee because she was so keyed up from it.2.Sometimes table service during the evening shows was a little slow due to not enough staff. The waiters  waitresses were hustling like crazy to keep up. I attribute this to the great night weather and the quality of the shows that were better than we saw at the Barcelo Complex, so attendance was up, almost standing room only.Departure: Oh and about the bus. On our way out of the resort on Sunday evening, I commented that this bus seemed to be in better shape. Well about five miles down the road the bus started to overheat. The driver had to pull over in front of this small roadside bar, get everyone out of the bus and let it cool down. We were all out of our element and a little nervous, but after fifteen minutes we were on our way againThe only event at the airport on departure was we got hit for $10 for 2 Kg overweight. They were OK in Toronto. I didn鈥檛 feel like fighting it but I probably should have. Overall a great trip to a beautiful resort and island. I would go back tomorrow if I had the vacation time  cash.

<Content>Great Midwinter Vacation Spot We were at the Iberostar Bavaro 2/26/05-3/05/05. We traveled via a charter with TNT from Boston. This resort was great overall and I would definitely go back. We are a couple in our 50's and went with one other couple.Arrival: Our charter go us to the hotel at about 10:30 at night. We were very tired from a long day of travel and anticipated a tedious check in process. We were wrong. The hotel made check in a breeze. They had a manila folder all set for us with keys, towel cards, resort information and a registration card. We were told to simply get our bracelets put on by the friendly girl waiting for us adjacent to the check in desk and bring back the completed registration card at our convenience. We attached the supplied luggage tags to our bags, got our bracelets and got a drink at the bar. Once the entire group got settled with drinks on comfortable couches in the lobby a registration clerk came over and explained the ins and outs of the hotel tom us all. We knew that we wanted a safe key, so when he was done we filled out the registration card and returned it to the desk at which time we got our safe key. Having finished our drinks, we wandered down to our room and got there just as the bell men arrived with our luggage. One of the easiest check ins ever. By the way, they informed us that they were opening up the buffet restaurant for us at 11:00 pm for burgers, hot dogs, cold cuts and snacks as they assumed we were all hungry from our trip. The burgers were great!Room:We did try to get upgraded to a room overlooking the beach, but were told that none were available as some German tour group had paid extra to reserve them. We had e-mailed them a week in advance and made our request again when we were checking in. They offered a room overlooking the pool to the couple we were traveling with, but they did not bother moving as it was not much different than the one they had.Bavaro's rooms are all junior suites. Ours was on the ground floor just over the bridge from the main buffet restaurant and was very quiet. We did not notice any musty or other smells as others have reported. We left a couple of bucks for the maid each day and our room was always well cleaned and the mini fridge was always restocked with what we want. The safe is good sized and worked just fine. One day we had difficulty locking our sliding door to the balcony so we called the desk and they had someone there in ten minutes who fixed it on the spot. Beach:Fantastic, I cannot say enough good things about it. This is a large resort with lots of beachfront so, if you want a lot of activity all day just camp out in front of the pool. The Star Friends will keep you appraised of what's going on all day long. If you want peace and quiet, just walk a little ways to the left or right and you will be left alone. The sand here is very fine, the water warm, the views are gorgeous and there are lots of beach walkers going by most of the day.Food  Drink:We really enjoyed the variety of food offered. There was never a time we could not find something good to eat. In fact, we made a game out of trying something new every meal. Some we loved, some we didn't but there was plenty of variety. We only ate two dinners at the buffet restaurant because we wanted to try the specialty restaurants. Both times were very good. There are steaks and chops available every night that are grilled to your order as well as a pasta station and fajita station. Frankly, if you cannot find something to your liking here you should not be going to an all inclusive resort. We tried the Steakhouse restaurant, (good sirloins done just as ordered); the Mediterranean, (fish that even non fish eaters can like), and the Japanese, (excellent-the best of the specialty restaurants). We were also invited to a Manager's Special Dinner one night at the Mediterranean where we had a choice of lobster or chicken. Both were delicious. Drinks were typical tropical fare, nothing especially good or bad though it should be noted that they premix the most popular fruity drinks like Pina Colada's in big dispensing machines. They are not made individually in blenders, but they are good.The beer was a local brand only.Shows:There is a show nightly. They seemed to alternate between fancy shows put on by the Star staff and follies shows involving the guests embarrassing themselves. The follies shows are very funny and the staff shows are OK. The staff sing and dance very enthusiastically. We wandered over to the Dominicana a couple of nights and saw there shows, which were essentially the same as Bavaro's. There is a disco and casino over there. The disco is fun but smoky and we did not try the casino.Shopping:There are stores at the hotel and a collection of flea-market type shops a short walk down the beach. Check out the prices at the hotel and then go down to the flea market to bargain if you're so inclined. Otherwise just buy things at the hotel. The prices there are set so no bargaining.Sickness:Bring Imodium. Two of our foursome had some minor stomach distress, (one was brushing his teeth with tap water. Imodium took care of it and neither missed more than one meal. Two of us opted for anti-malarial medication, (chloraquine) prior to the trip but we only saw a couple of mosquitoes one evening while watching a show. We did notice them fogging for bugs one day. Overall:I would go back in a minute. We had a great vacation. Iberostar understands how to do the all-inclusive vacation and does it very well. We only speak English and had no problem communicating with the staff. We tried our best to use simple Spanish phrases and the effort seemed appreciated by the staff, (my attempts at Spanish brought lots of smiles). The resort is beautiful, the staff is friendly and attentive and the beach is the best. Go-enjoy!

<Content>Iberostar is no. 1 We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from Jan 27 through Feb 3, 2005 and had a wonderful time. The room, food, service and facility were all excellent. The Dominican people at the resort were super nice, hard-working, and always with a smile on their face. We never felt tips were expected, but we did it because how could you not when you receive such an incredible level of service? Here are our review:* Room: we got a ground floor room with king bed, close to the pool, very clean. We had NO problem with the a/c or smell. Mini fridge was always well-stocked! One day, the chamber maid even left us Iberostar chocolates!* Food: excellent...We ate at the Gourmet (grilled lobster), Japanese (my favorite) and Mediterannean (lobster paella and other seafoods - huge portions, hot/cold appertizers buffet was very good). Buffets were surprisingly good, great variety for both lunch and dinner. No shortage of good food at this place!* Pool: not heated, so a little cold when you first get in but your body will adjust. The swim-up bar was great. Check out the pools at the other two Iberostar resorts next door, they're great too.* Beach: nice turquoise color, but a little choppy at that time of the year - compared to the very calm beach in Varadero, Cuba in the summer. Too much wave action for my liking. If a calm beach is what you're looking for, perhaps you shouldn't come here during the winter months* Gym: How often can you work out with an ocean view? We did it once!* Excursions: We did the Caribbean Festival (snorkeling and swimming with Stingrays and Nurse Sharks) - for $70 US per person - well worth it. Snorkeling part was short and OK (because of the choppy ocean). But the Stingrays and Nurse Sharks are not to be missed. Staff on the boat were awesome and very entertaining.* Other: Bring enough US cash to pay for your excursion! The tour operator's representative at the resort kinda ripped us off with the exchange rate. We paid by Visa for one person so she had to convert 70 USD to Dominican pesos. When we receive our visa statement, the Domincan peso amount worked out to be $81 US! Small change but annoying!

<Content>A little disappointed Six of us stayed at the Bavaro 2/19/05-2/26/05. We are all experienced travelers in our 50's. We stayed at the Iberostar Tucan in Playa Del Carmen last year. This hotel is at least a step below the Tucan. We gave the Tucan a 5 rating. Flight/Customs/Transfer - We booked through Apple and everything went very smooth. Flights were right on time both coming and going. The Punta Cana airport is a small open air facility. Much easier to get through than Cancun or Jamaica. You are charged a $10 fee per person at the airport and have to fill out a customs form. Normally we've done this on the plane prior to landing. We also have never had to pay this fee before, as it was part of the Apple package. This has changed since the last time we were in Punta Cana.Check-In - The check-in was efficient. We had e-mailed the resort twice requesting second floor rooms near the pool/beach. They responded saying that they would do what they could. As it turned out we were given rooms as far away from the pool/beach as you could possibly get, two of the three were on the first floor. So much for that request. To their credit they did move us the following day. Rooms - Nothing special. Bathtubs with a shower. Sunken sitting area and a nice balcony. Beds were comfortable. Furnishings a bit worn. The rooms could use some touchup paint. Had some small ants in room. The maid sprayed and that corrected the problem. There is a safe in the room. You must obtain the key at the front desk after check-in. Food - Very average. Buffet was not as good as most all-inclusives that we have been to. There was plenty to choose from but the quality was just not up to par. The ala-carte restaurants that we ate at were the Japanese and the Gourmet (lobster). We ate at the Japanese twice and it was very good. The Goumet was just OK. Lobster was dry and relatively tasteless. We heard comments that the Steakhouse restaurant (near the beach  pool) was good. The Steakhouse is open air, so it is not air conditioned. No one in our party had any stomach/intestinal issues with the food. Drinks - They were good, but if you wanted top shelf liquor you had to ask. They would mix them any way you wished. Tips really helped their memory. We occasionally were given service on the beach but it wasn't consistant. There is one beach bar. The other bar is in the pool restaurant area, so it isn't that convenient to the beach. Taking large insulated mugs saves trips to the bar and keeps your drink cold in the hot sun. The swim-up bar is in the main pool area and is very shaded. The pool bar wasn't used very much. The lobby bar is nice and the bartenders do a very good job. Great place to meet before, or after, dinner. Pool/Beach - Both areas very nice and well maintained. They clean the pool and beach areas early each morning. People do reserve the prime pool areas early each morning (7am or before) so if you are a late sleeper you will get what is left. Chairs on the beach are plentiful and can be had anytime during the day. Palapas need to be reserved early in the day if you want one close to the beach. Fitness Center - Not too bad for a resort. Had a nice array of free and stacked weights. Dumbells up to about 65 pounds. One eliptical, several stairmasters, a couple of treadmills along with at least four stationary bicycles. Casino - We are not gamblers so didn't spend much time in there. Several people were playing black jack and many playing the slot machines. Not a large casino but seemed big enough to handle the crowd that was in there. Service - The service was good and the staff did their best to accomodate your needs. We did tip freely because these people do work hard for the money. Tipping the maid daily did not produce towel art, or for that matter anything beyond the basic service that one would expect. I did see other people that had received towel art, however. Overall - We had a very good time at the Bavaro but it did fall short of what we have come to expect from Iberostar. We have stayed at several Iberostar properties in the past. This is not one of their better ones. Their property and service in Mexico is superior to what we received at this resort.

<Author>BeachBum21
<Content>A wonderful vacation destination...great value My girlfriend and I have just returned from our visit to Punta Cana's Iberostar Bavaro Resort (2/26 to 3/5). I must say, we absolutely loved it! The grounds, weather, food, service and entertainment were all better than our expectations. First, the weather was perfect. It was 82-85 everyday, with hardly any clouds. It rained once, but it was at night and into the early morning. It wasn't buggy at all, even after the morning rain. It wasn't as windy as we expected either; if anything I'd describe it as a welcoming breeze which provided relief from the strong sun. The beach was awesome: white sands, turquoise water, and tiki huts which were great for some much needed shade at times. The grounds of the resort are immaculate. Beautiful foliage and a variety of bird life provide for a spectacular scenery around the bungalos (one of the advantages over the Dominicana and Punta Cana). The food was actually quite good. The buffets were better than expected, but the ala carte restaurants at night were better. We ate at a different one each night, which is how we believe we got the best value possible. Our favorites were the Gourmet (caribbean lobster), Japanese, Mexican and Steak house. Although the meat isn't as good as in the States, if you get the skirt steak, it is tender and well marinated ( on the menu it was listed as Beef Plate, but you can tell from the picture that it is indeed skirt steak). For our last night, we were invited to join the couples dinner at the Gourmet, where they served Beef tenderlion. This cut was of high quality; they cooked it rare and to perfection to my surprise once again. My advice would be to email guest services through Iberostar's website before hand to get reservations. I think this is how we were able to get a table for each night of our stay. As for alcohol, they normally serve no-name brands, and promote the fruity drinks, which are always fun. However, if you ask for it, they have Johnny Walker Red, Dewar's, Stoli, and Tanqueray...pleasantly surprised here, and definitely got my money's worth. As for the water, no problems there either. They give you plently of bottled water in your mini frig, and by the end of the week we were using tap water to brush our teeth (and I was paranoid about this in the beginning). The staff is so friendly; they are always going out of their way to make sure you're having a good time. Amazingly, they work all day at the pool/beach and also perform in the shows at night...long days, but it seems like they have fun at what they do. There is also plenty of security (esp. at night), although after awhile you don't even notice. We really felt safe there. The shows which we attended nightly were a good mix of performances (singing/dancing) and audience-involved contests (i.e. couple contests/ Miss Iberostar). Afterwards, we'd usually head to the small casino, which has several black jack tables, roullette, and slots. It's nothing great, but definitely provided some entertainment. You can play with US dollars or pesos. I recommend bringing cash if you plan to play. Otherwise you have to take out money in pesos and deal with the exchange rates. We also attended the disco where a good amount of guests came to drink and dance. It's open till 3, but usually dies around 1. Next door is Star cafe which has Karaoke nightly, which was a lot of fun.To sum it up, this place is a beautiful, relaxing vacation spot where you can live stress-free for a week at a good price. Would I go back? Definitely.

<Content>Awsome Blossom in Carribean Our stay 2/7 - 2/14/2005. Hola! This was the best vacation we ever had. Have been talking about it ever since. Not one bad experience. It was a week in PARADISE! Yes some of the food was unidentifiable to us (Americans), but tried it all and was pleasantly suprised. Very tasty, very good. Every encounter with the staff was enjoyable. Such friendly, happy people. Always wanting to please you. A dollar tip goes a long way. The resort was fabulous! So clean and beautiful. Upon returning home and viewing pictures, my friends asked about droppings from the peacocks that were everywhere. I had to reply never saw any droppings. The grounds keepers did a great job of keeping the place clean. My only complaint (if you can call it that) - no coffee maker in the room. And room service will not deliver a pot of coffe in the morning. The weather was perfect - sunny the whole time (80-85) everyday, mild breeze. But take something long sleeved for evening. The air was quite cool. Again the staff must be commeded for working such long days (most of them work 16 hrs.) and always with the SMILE! Got to love these people. They know how to work and have fun at it. Something we Americans have lost sight of. We can't wait to go back. Hope you enjoy this place as much as we did.

<Content>Great Beach Vacation My wife and I spent a week here (2/18-25/05) and had a great time. Here are some of our thoughts:1. The facility is beautiful with very good food and courteous, friendly staff. 2. Beach walks are long and awesome, but be aware that there is always a breeze (sometimes strong) that keeps things cool. 3. It is definitely an international destination (French, German, Italian, etc.). We found that interesting and not a negative. 4. First-time travelers will occasionally find the language a challenge. Fine if you are patient and have a sense of humor. 5. There was no topless sunbathing at the pool. (On the beaches, yes.) 6. Lots of peacocks, flamingos and other birds. 7. Tipping seems to be expected and not discouraged or penalized. (How times have changed at all-inclusives!) 8. Our only out-of-resort excursion was the 鈥渁ll day island.鈥?Be aware the first 2陆- 3 hours are spent on a bus. 9. Surprise! They do have call brands (i.e., Beefeaters  Canadian Club), but they鈥檙e out-of-sight below the bars and must be requested. 10. Mini-bars in the room have beer, soda and bottled water.  Hope this is helpful!

<Content>Enjoyed our stay! My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 2/18-2/25/05 and we really enjoyed it. The ride to the resort from the airport was not as bad as I had heard. We rode on a big air-conditioned bus, and made 2 stops at the other Iberostar resorts before we got to the Bavaro. It only took 1/2 hour at the most. If you stay at the Bavaro, you can have access to the other 2 Iberostar resorts as well. Check-in was very quick and they briefed us on how to make dinner reservations, use the towel cards and the safe etc... and we were greeted with a Banana Mama drink (very good). Our room was very nice and we were very happy with it. We made dinner reservations for 3 nights. We picked the Gourmet restaurant which served lobster. The menu is set and they bring out each course. The food was different but ok. The Mediterranean restaurant was very good and they had an appetizer and dessert buffet, but you order the main course. The third one we tried was the Japenese restaurant which was also very good. We ate at the Star Rock cafe one night too which we liked. There are no reservations for that restaurant but you have to get there at 6:30 to get a seat right away. The rest of the time we ate at the buffets which I did not really care for the food. I bought a bag of chips at the gift shop one night and it cost $7! The first 3 days we were there were cloudy and very windy, but it cleared up the last couple days and the weather was very nice. I had to get up early and put towels on our chairs by the pool in the morning or there were no spots left by the time we got out there! By 8:00 am, people had already reserved most of the chairs! There were plenty of spots by the beach however. Another thing we had to reserve was the tennis courts. They put the list out every morning at 8:00 am to reserve the courts for the next day. I got there at 9:00 one morning and all the spots were filled. So, if you want a court, get there at 8:00 am.There are little massage huts on the beach, but I decided to get a massage at the spa instead. It was great! It was $25 for a half hour and they charge it to your room. I also had a manicure at the spa which was $15. They have a gym above the spa which I also used and it was ok. I went to the Step aerobics class near the gym which was fun. At night the staff put on a show at about 9:30 pm. I found the shows very entertaining. They often ask for volunteers from the audience and make them do funny things. One night they had a Mr. Iberostar contest with 4 men from the audience which was hilarious. You would see some of the staff working at the pool during the day and putting on the shows or bartending at night so they work long hours. The staff are very friendly and enthusiastic! Most can speak several languages which is nice because there are people from all over that stay at this resort. I can speak a little spanish but I never felt like there was a communication barrier. Although tips are included, we brought alot of $1 bills and gave tips to the housekeepers, bartenders, and the people at the spa. The rum flows freely and it only costs about $2.50 for a small bottle in the gift shop, so we bought a bunch to bring back as gifts. They also brought a bottle of rum to our room when we checked in. The resort and grounds were very nice and the staff were great. We had a good time at this resort and we would recommend it!

<Content>Great Vacation at Iberostar Bavaro My husband and I were at the Iberostar Bavaro from 2/13-2/21 and had a wonderful time. We did take the anti malaria meds as a precaution. We did not see one mosiqito. We did not and NOT ONE PERSON we spoke to got sick. We were prepared and never needed anything. To me one of the most important things at a large hotel like this is the room location. Ours could not have been better-PERFECT room 2538, second floor, king bed,non smoking, near pool(not next to-too noisey) and centrally located.(close to main walkway which in one way went to entertainment and restaurants and the other way was going the the other hotels. And straight ahead was the pool and beach. We were originally given a different room that had a terrible problem with the smell with the air conditioning. I went to reception and she couldn't have been nicer. Of course I was the guest asking with a smile, and treating her with respect, while there were others with problems who were NASTY. They got no where. I was thrilled with our room. Casino- was small but efficient enough to have fun (very smokey)Food- There seems to be confusion on this. If you stay a week you are guaranteed 3 reservations on the books at a time. This does not mean that you an only have three, you can have as many as you want if there are openings. Which there always was at some restaurant. We ate at the japanese- Hashiru, mexican-La Hispaniola (at Dominicana)Mediterran-LaDorada. The steak house- LosBohios 2 times. The buffet at the Dominicana was much better than the one at the Bavaro- Many more choices and more lively. Something to keep in mind is that if you are in the sun all day/drinking you will most likely need a nap in the afternoon and therefore you will want to eat much later than you think. The kids show starts at 8:30 with the adult entertainment at 9:45. We ate between 8:00-8:30 every night and never missed a show which was entertaining.The weather- Sunny, 80's just beautiful. There was a breeze which could make it quite cool if you are on the beach. The ocean water was fantastic.We got floats at the store (get them filled at the dive shop)and layed in the ocean with the waves(no big deal we're from New England) Used the water sports equipment and had a blast. Pool- as stated it could get breezey. The wind comes off the ocean so if you sit between the rest/swim up bar and the rooms you will not get the breeze. The pool water was cool but not so cold that you couldn't enjoy it.(we used floats in here to) it was great. 6 out of 8 days were great. The last to were overcast and rather cool. My husband was disturbed as there was bird crap on the walkways around the pool in the same places for quite a few days. When he saw management-Swedish? He mentioned it to them and it was taken care of the next day. He also mentioned the problem with the airconditioning and managment said this is a problem they are working on. We suggested they put screens in the sliding doors and windows so you could keep them open and get the breeze. This vacation was great. Keep in mind if you are going on vacation with a person that finds things to complain about in you normal life, it's not going to change because you're on vacation. Those type of people can ALWAYS find something wrong. We would go back. Any question feel free to email me.

<Content>what a great place This was the best vacation ever!! The Iberostar is terrific, everyone is friendly and extremly helpful. The only negative comment I have is it is very humid and I never got the smell out of the luggage. I would suggest you place you luggage in a plastic bag or use frebreeze. The food was fantastic and the entertainmet is even better. The water is wonderful. I will go back and very soon. Just be prepared for the airport, it is very different and crowded, but a new experience. The Iberostar is the best resort out there.

<Content>The most incredible vacation Ive ever had I just got back from Iberostar Bavaro in the DR lastnight 02-18-05, Ive been shaking my head and laughing all day today, I had such a great time it was crazy. Ive never been to al all inclusive before or even to an island for that matter, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say I was in paradise for a week. The hotel, the grounds, the beach, even the staff, I have no complaints.  Before I left for my trip I was a wreck because I read all about people taking the maleria drugs and not drinking the water and returning home from the DR terribly ill. I am so glad I did not cancel my trip. I did not see a single mosquito the whole week, and I did not get ill at any point. My better half even drank the water on the grounds, He had water poured from a pitcher at every meal, I can admit I even brushed my teeth with the bathroom sink water. NO PROBLEMS.... Maybe the crypto virus 10 years ago or so did something to me and I have a awesome immune system, I dont know, but I would send any one of my friends there in a heartbeat. Just a note, I did two excursions, the two person speed boat deal where you end up on a big boat and snorkel on the reef, that was so much fun, but be prepared to get spashed and swallow salt water the whole time, I would suggest bringing goggles on this one because the water also really burns the eyes and its hard to see when your going so fast. (Dont try bringing a nice camera on this excursion, I had my very small digital camera in two lunch baggies, the tweed camera case and two small grocery bags all tied up nicely and somehow, water got in and ate up my $500.00 camera, a very expensive lession.....) a water camera would be good on this one. I did another excursion, the swim with Nurse sharks and sting rays, at the Marinarium, DO THIS ONE!!!!!! It is a blast, the crew really goes out of their way to show you a good time. You can bring your video and regular cameras on this one because it is protected on the very large boat. you dont get to touch the sting rays or the sharks but you swim right above them. It is really cool. Any way, Ill end it here,  My trip was the best ive ever had. Any questions feel free to respond

<Content>Magnificent resort! Just came back from a beautiful 9 day vacation at the Iberostar Hotel Punta Cana from Feb 7th to 15th 2005, two adults (48 years) and a 16 year old daughter.Arrived with Air France after a 10 hours flight in a narrow seated Jumbo and poor service. Transportation to the hotel needed some improvisation but besides these troubles (which repeated on the way back) everything else was phantastic:Great rooms, no bugs, mosquitos or ants, good A/C (but not really necessary since it was not very hot), excellent food, surroundings, parc, beach, personnel, weather, entertainment...The guests were a interesting mixture between old and young, Europeans and Americans, very international and after a few hours together with the friendly personnel, most guests had a relaxed smile on their face.Spanish is not necessary since most announcements were made in English, French and German too.We did the Jurassic Safari trip which I recommend to everybody, snorkeling from the beach (about 1 hour, take bread with you to feed the fish), bananaboat and a lot of the hotel activities (shooting, dance, swim, boccia...). We eat in three speciality restaurants (tropical, oriental, and mexican) buffet for the starters was always excellent, but the main dishes were always a bit disappointing.We will probably come back next year and try some more trips in this interesting country.

<Content>Iberostaro Bavaro - 2nd time even better We returned to IB Bavaro for the second year in a row, just got back on Feb 13.Flight down with Skyservice no problem - larger plane, leather seats, more room, a definite improvement. We were the only guest for this hotel so we had a minivan take us straight to the hotel with no delay - Perfect.Now about the hotel - What can we say...we feel it has gotten better since last year. Maybe its just that we were more familiar with it, but WOW!We asked for top floor, king bed near beach and pool and got it.We booked our 3 dinner reservations and then went back to guest services in the afternoons of the other days and got left over reservations to other restaurants. A couple of nights, we just wanted the buffet, which is fine for us, only problem we have is that they water down the wine in the buffet. They may think they are fooling us but we winos know the difference. Dinner at the gourmet restaruant for first time (didn't go last year). Very nice presentation, very good wine and the grilled lobster was enjoyable. Steakhouse dinner good, hubby had the top sirloin and raved about it. I enjoy the appetizers at the Japanese, but the main courses need a bit of work.Attended a cocktail reception for returning guests - very nice. We had a problem with our safe mid-week (hubby deprogrammed it somehow). We called for service and literally within 5 minutes someone was there to reset it for us.Our maid service was excellent - only 1 day she got behind schedule and was very apologetic (in Spanish of course). Lots of water after we left a note in Spanish by the fridge. A/C, hot water fine. TV has new satellite channels from last yr.A broad mix of cultures as usual, most people extremely pleasant, regardless of where they were from.Will likely be back again next year, although I am missing Mexico a bit - but it will definitely be Iberostar wherever we go.

<Content>Had a blast - complaints unwarranted My girlfriend and I (mid-twenties) stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro for 3 nights from February 11th - 14th. Accommodations:Pristine grounds and a beautiful room. Employees were everywhere grooming, cleaning, and keeping the grounds looking perfect. The room was spacious, extremely clean, and there were no bugs, critters, or funky odors. We had the great fortune of ending up with a beachfront villa and the location next to the pool couldn't have been any better.Food:The buffets have plenty of choices and employees were bringing out fresh dishes even when mealtimes were coming to a close (which is almost never). In 3 nights, we ate at the specialty restaurants twice (Mediterranean - good, Japanese - great). Although the d茅cor was a little cheesy, the food was good and the themed menu was a nice change from the broad buffet choices. We were both pretty paranoid about getting sick, but after forgetting to take Pepto before our first meal, we decided to skip the meds unless we needed them. Needless to say, we didn't and were happy that we could eat all the fruits, vegetables, seafood, and meats without incident. We had a suspicion that any sickness might be due to the fact that this is buffet-style (a random sneeze, hand grabbing, etc.) rather than unclean preparation.Drinks:There's a bar around every corner and if you wait more than 5 seconds for your drink, you probably just weren't paying attention. Local brands are offered around the resort (no Jack), but other brands are available in the specialty restaurants for a change. The wine offered at meals (red or white) is not the best, but drinkable. We're not really into fruity-frozen drinks, but it did seem that they offered a large variety of them. The mini-bar is stocked every other day, but they will re-stock it whenever you want if you request it. We asked for ours to be refilled after day 1 and we came back an hour later with 8 beers and 8 bottles of water in our refrigerator (tipping works for a reason).Weather:This was our only slight complaint which was obviously no fault of the resort. If you are planning a trip to get away from the cold weather, February is fine. However, if you are planning this trip with snorkeling and scuba as a 'must-do', April would be better due to the wind dying down. It was still sunny and warm (~82), but the wind was probably around 10mph which made our snorkeling plans a bust. The wind turned into a breeze at night though, and the weather couldn't be any better after the sun went down.Activities:The wind made it difficult to take advantage of some the activities offered (kayaking, snorkeling), but there was always something to do if you looked for it. Being there for only 3 days, we were fine with just staying on the beach/pool and walking around the resorts. We walked down the beach to the 'flea market' and found our souvenirs there ($12 for a bottle of rum, $13 for a sarong). We found out that they go home for the day around 5:30pm, so that is the best time to get good prices (but they will also be more aggressive in their selling). The shows at night are a little cheesy, but they are out in the open-air and can be seen from the bar, so we actually enjoyed the little bit that we saw. There is not much 'nightlife' (i.e. the Disco is hilarious), but the bars are open late and the beach is perfect at night. Overall:This trip was amazing and we actually felt a little stupid by not taking some of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I'm not exactly sure what people are complaining about after staying at the Bavaro. I've been to two other (all-inclusive) resorts in Mexico and had a good time, but they did not compare to this trip. If you keep your expectations in check, the Iberostar will not disappoint and will probably far exceed them.

<Content>What a great time I took my girlfriend (now my fiance, thanks to this trip) here for a winter break Dec. 9-14 and had a blast!. From the time we walked off the plane, to the time we walked back on to leave was the most enjoyable vacation either of us have had. The food was great at the restaraunts, even the buffet was better than we expected. ( lunch at the Steak House by the pool was outstanding!) The only complaint my fiance had was that the drinks weren't cold enough, I think thats the price you have to pay for such beautiful weather. I had a little trouble trying to figure out where to get the free rental snorkeling gear, but after I found it, I found the water in front of the resort filled with all kinds of fish and coral. We did go on the 1/2 day snorkeling excursion and it was fun, but not worth the price and not much better than the resorts beach. The only complaint I had was that the Europeans seem to get a much better deal on their stay than we did. One couple we met paid about half what we did and they stayed twice as long. I read quite a few reviews on this resort before I booked it and was a little nervous after reading several negative ones... I have a feeling that the people who wrote them wouldn't have been happy if they were given the trip for free! All in all, I would highly recommend this resort and I'm already planning on staying here next year. The only change we will have is that we're going to get an ocean view.

<Content>Just got back from the IB Bavaro Just returned from a week at the IB Bavaro. It was our first trip to the DM but I have been to the Bahamas and Aruba. I picked the DM after reading some reviews and falling down when I got a quote on a trip back to Aruba.The resort is 5 star. There are more activities, food, bars, pools, beach and fun than you can pack into 7 days. The people were friendly and hospitable. English is a problem with most but they speak more English than most visitors speak Spanish. Regardless, you could always get your point across. Food was about 3 stars in quality, 5 stars in quantity. If you went home hungry or sober it was your own doing.The weather was perfect, 80's in the day and 60's at night. It can get chilly in the evening if the trade winds are blowing. We had 6 days of sunshine and one day of clouds.The grounds are absolutely beautiful. Tropical plants and birds galore. The bars were well stocked and the restrooms were always clean.A couple of points that I read before in other reviews that I think I should emphasize. The DM is poverty-stricken. I would not recommend leaving the resort unless you have a tour. We were on the edge of the property and there were armed guards walking the fence line at night. We felt safe but it was a bit scary. To wit, the people live in poverty. We brought some crayons and coloring books to give out to the service people at the resort. It was like given them $100, very appreciative in broken English. Also, prepare for a day on the crapper. Almost everyone I talked to ended up with some sort of stomach ailment, some worse than others. I had my doctor give me some pills in case but when I got there I read the instructions that said, Do not take with alcohol or go into direct sunlight while on this medication. Some doctor! I would pay the $10 co-pay and get something prescription strength just in case. The casino is small but proved to be quite lucrative for me. They do mess up on the deal from time to time so keep your eyes pealed. I felt is was ignorance, not fraudulence. Be sure to bring plenty of everything. My wife spent $15 on a bottle of Pantene conditioner (about $4 at home). There are mini-bars in the room if you want to bring some special drinks with you. People who had purchased cigars and cigarettes at the beach shops said they were stale, a guess sitting in the sun will do that to them.I would go back to the IB in the future and would recommend anyone else to do so also.

<Content>Great Vacation! My girlfriend and I traveled to the Iberostar Bavaro Jan 29 - February 5th. This was our second time visiting the resort and we would gladly return for a third time.Flight:We took an American Airlines flight into Punta Cana and were greeted by our Prieto Tour guide at the airport. As usual check in was a breeze and we had no problems what so ever. Everything was fine, however if I had to do it again I would probably go with Apple Vacations as my overall experience was slightly better.Check In/ Check Out:Both of these at the hotel went fine. We were greeted with our welcome drinks and told to grab a bite to eat by the pool and wait for our room to be completed. Our room was done within 15 minutes of arrival. We had emailed a week before and got a great room in the exact location we were looking for. Check out was even easier than check in. It took all of 30 seconds.Hotel Rooms:The rooms at the Bavaro suites were as I remembered them. The rooms are fine with plenty of room and the A/C was incredible. We had to keep it on the lowest setting as our room often got very cold. Maybe it was just our sunburn! We brought dryer sheets, room spray,etc. and to be honest we did not need it. It had a very faint musty smell but you are in a tropical island, what can you expect. We left a tip for our maid daily and she always did a great job and finished cleaning our room very early.Beach/ Pool:The beach is beautiful. We did not notice a problem with the seaweed. The way some people described it I thought you wouldn't even be able to swim. The seaweed is almost non existent. The beach was a little breezy but it was not a problem at all. The pool is very nice and always seems a little more crowded than the beach. There is always an activity going on. The water was cool, both in the pool and the ocean, but it provided relief from the sun.Food:This was our biggest surprise. The last time we were there we were disappointed in the food. We really thought the buffets at lunch and dinner were poor. However this time the food is much improved. The one thing everyone needs to realize is that the food tastes different as it is in a different country. The ketchup tastes different, things fried taste different almost everything tastes different. Everyday we ate by the pool buffet. If you want safe American tasting food stick with the rotisserie chicken and fries. We had this everyday for lunch and had no stomach issues. The chicken is very good. The buffet dinner was also very good. You could always find something to eat. My girlfriend had the made to order pasta every night we were there and I had it a few nights. It is actually very good. We also ate at three specialty restaurants. The steak house by the pool was actually very good. I would recommend it. We also at the spanish restaurant. I would not go there. It is a little stuffy in there and I was a little uncomfortable in the long pants. Finally we ate at the japenese restaurant. This was good and I would also recommend this. Basically I think you could go here and stick to the buffets and eat very well.Entertainment:This was a blast. We didn't go to the casino and only went once to the disco. We were here to enjoy ourselves and relax. The disco is fine and usually a pretty good time. We just sat at the lobby bar and watched the shows. The bartenders are fantastic. They are so nice and usually they put on a show of their own. Basically we had our own bartender who waited on us the entire week. Actually, our bartender from 3 years prior still remembered us. He took care of us or the whole week.The shows were okay. Nothing special, but you can tell they work hard making these shows come together.Overall:The trip was incredible. For the money, you can not beat this place.

<Content>Very nice resort Just got back from a weeks stay at the Iberostar Bavaro and had a nice relaxing time. EVERY employee (except one waiter) was very nice at this resort. Always with a smile and 'Hola'. Everything was very clean. We are very picky about quality food, and would rate the food 3.5 - 3.75 (out of 5) for the most part. Never a problem getting a restaurant reservation. Good breakfast buffet. Drink service at the bar was always very quick. AWESOME coffee here too!! I've read complaints about the steak here...I had flank steak at the Mexican restaurant and it was very good. Also try the tres leche torte for dessert there! The beach was windy, but I think it's pretty common in Punta Cana. Still warm enough though. Snorkeling is no good from the beach though.   We did do the snorkeling tour to the Marinarium (at the recommendation of our Funjet rep). I would STRONGLY advise against wasting your time with this trip. They advertise it at 4 hours, but it's closer to 6. The staff on the boat is extremely annoying. Most of the trip they blast techno music going out to the dive site, you only snorkel for 30 minutes, and you really can't see much. The onboard snacks and drinks were Wonder bread, american cheese slices, ham and mustard. The tropical drink was a nasty version of the Coco Loco served in a cup the size of a Nyquil dispenser. What a waste!  If you are into cigars, I would highly recommend going into the town of Bavaro to the Juan Clemente shop. These are top quality Dominican cigars they roll right there that are not available in the states. Very good explanation and demonstration of the cigar making process, and excellent cigar flavor too.   I would highly recommend this resort to anyone. Be adventurous in your food choices (excellent cheeses everywhere, and try the Chinola fruit for breakfast) and try the Coco Loco drink with Anejo rum. Email if you have any specific questions.

<Content>Great Time at the Iberostar Bavaro We stayed at the Bavaro Jan 22-29/05. All I can say is that we had a FANTASTIC time. There was eight of us on this vacation and no one had any complaints. The food was good lots to choose from. Our waiter was superb he was always happy and singing and got us whatever we needed. No one got sick and if they did it was self inflicted ie. too many Coco Locos or rum and juice. Everyone that worked there are very friendly our rooms were very clean and spacious. The pool was nice however we spent most of our time at the beach. The pool bar is a little out of the way so there were not alot of people there. Get to the beach early if you want a spot it fills up fast. Go to the market just down the beach it is good but remember to BARGIN. Don't get to excited about the casino it is VERY small and very hot in there. Other than that the grounds are beautiful and very clean there is lots of peacocks and flamingo's as well as other wildlife it is really neat. I would definelty go back to this resort. Make sure you buy all your stuff at home everything on the resort is expensive ie. $28 us for underwater camera.

<Content>Beautiful resort and friendly staff. My wife and I and our 4-year-old son stayed at Iberostar Bavaro from Feb 2 thru Feb 9, 2005. The notably good things: The staff is very friendly, helpful, energetic, and fond of children. We taught my son to say Hola! and Gracias, and the staff were delighted. The grounds are beautiful and impeccably maintained - peacocks, egrets, flamingos reside there. The beach is very wide, and there are plenty of palapas for shade - no need to stake one out at 7:00 AM or risk a bad sun burn like at some other resorts. The beach lounge chairs are new and comfy. The food, while not gourmet, is above average for an all-inclusive. The specialty restaurants are good, esp the Japanese and the steak house by the beach. The resort is quite large, as it ajoins the other Iberostars (Dominicus and Punta Cana), the prime difference being the small 8-unit buildings in Bavaro and the 4-storey hotel layout of the other two. The bad things: My wife was not pleased with room cleanliness, but she's a bit of a neat freak. The kids' mini-club was rather basic, but the kids' staff is wonderful. Look for Casey and Lolli if you use the mini-club. We felt comfortable with them because they will get to know your child (not just another charge for them). My son used the club to meet other kids his age, and then played with them later at the beach, pool or in the early evening. Actually, the only really disappointing thing, which had nothing to do with the Iberostar, was the WIND. In our week, we had one day of light breezes. The other days had enough wind to curtail the windsurfing, sailing and snorkelling, and made the ocean very choppy. I swam in the pool every day and it was lovely. Our first trip to Punta Cana in March 2004 proved similarly windy, and the staff at that resort said it was unusual. Apparently not. If we do not return to Iberostar Bavaro, it will be only for the windy conditions we found. The resort is wonderful, and I would encourage anyone to go.

<Content>Weather was cooler than expected, but had a wonderful time This was our third trip to Punta Cana. We arrived home Feb. 4,2005. Each visit, we stayed at a different resort. The Iderostar Bavaro was incredibly beautiful, very clean and offered a nice variety of food and entertainment. We were disappointed with the cooler weather compared to our other stays. The beach was rough, water temperature was okay if you were able to get in and fight the seaweed. The pools however, were ice cold. Very few swimmers in the pools. I must add the day before we left, the seaweed seemed to clear. Our other visits were during the Christmas holidays and the temperatures were much warmer. Water was like a warm bath, we did a lot of swimming, but not this last trip. Evenings were very breezy, the wind made a whistling sound in our suite. You could use a cardigan or light jacket if you decide to take in the nightly shows. Since it was so cool, we decided to take a full day bus tour which I would not recommend. We visited a cigar factory, a cave, a little shopping, river boat ride with a lunch and the last destination of the tour was actually the best part, The Altos de Chavon. Too bad we didn't get to stay there longer to explore.  I would also like to mention that my husband made use of the 24 hour medical clinic at the resort. He refused to use sun block and ended up with an allergic skin reaction with hives and fever. The doctor was extremely nice and cared for him well. If you have travelers insurance, they cover the entire bill, but you must pay up front and be reimbursed, so keep your papers. The people who work at the resorts were so friendly and always made you smile. Watch out for James Bond on the beach.  Our first visit was 4 yrs ago, and I see great improvements in the airport and roads. It is becoming more commercialized, I even saw a Burger King. The prices are getting higher to vacation there, but worth every dollar. I hope to return again.

<Content>Value for your dollar???? My husband and I stayed at the Bavaro for three weeks and are disappointed with Air Transat鈥檚 brochure and what we actually received at this resort. This is our fourth time to Punta Cana, this being our third different resort. Each year investing a little more into our vacation with expectations that, what is advertised we would receive (without fighting for).   Room: We booked seven months prior to our trip, e-mailing the resort for a top floor, king size bed, ocean view. We e-mailed again two months prior and again one month prior, with our request. Upon arriving we only received the king size bed. We did not accept this and returned to reception many times. A couple of times the staff mentioned that the ocean view rooms are only reserved for German vacationers. When we mentioned this to 鈥淛ohnny鈥?the manager of reservations, he denied this and by the following morning we were given a top floor room, ocean view and a king size bed. The room is spacious as advertised but the air conditioner is a joke. All of the Iberostar resorts are like this; we had friends staying in the Dominican and the Punta Cana. The A/C is on a sensor, when you come into the room it turns on when there is no movement in the room it shuts off. The room never gets cool. As we are ex- smokers we were annoyed that on our third week our room would fill with smoke through the A/C when someone in one of the three other units on the top floor would smoke. The rooms are not self-contained. My husband checked this by looking up into the attic. The intake vent is not self contained it goes straight up into a full attic of all four top units. The safe is $2.00 U.S. per day. Bottled water is only available from your mini-fridge (4 small bottles per day) if you require more ask you maid to leave more.  Language: All three resorts of Iberostar are very fluent in many languages including English. This was a nice change from other resorts.  Food: This was our second huge problem with this resort. Air Transat advertises 9 a la carte restaurants with no limits. With three weeks vacation this was a very important aspect that this hotel supposedly offered. Upon arriving we are told we are only able to use 6 a la carte restaurants with a limit of 3 per week. The advertising claims you can access all a la carte and buffets at all three Iberostar resorts, Bavaro, Dominicana and Punta Cana. Guest services, this is where you make your reservations for the a la cartes, tell you that the brochure from Air Transat is wrong and claim that the Japanese, (at the Barvaro) is identical to the Asian (at the Punta Cana), and the Mediterranean (at the Bavaro) is identical to the Tropical (at the Dominican). These four restaurants have some overlapping menu items but by no means are they identical, in fact they have some very different menus items. The two gourmet restaurants are the same set menu (no choice here) but the lobster cooked at the Domicana Gourmet is far superior over the Bavaro Gourmet. The Steakhouse at Punta Cana is suppose to be identical to the Bavaro Steakhouse but we never went to the Punta Cana Steakhouse so we cannot say, if the cook is better at either one. The Sports Bar only offers food from 6 pm 鈥?8 pm and we didn鈥檛 try it. The interior of the Mexican restaurant was very hot and stuffy and with my husband in mandatory long pants, this was not a positive experience. For my husband and I to be able to access all restaurants we had to ask, Desiree (guest services) for the managers card. The front desk paged Ignacio M Subias (the manager) and we had to explain the problem with the restaurants which he granted us one visit to each restaurant but also claiming that some restaurants were identical. Desiree (at guest services) was a rude and uncooperative employee and at one point we had to write a letter to Ignacio M Subias about her conduct. She would throw books down on her desk and bang on her computer, all because she did not want us to have the privilege of accessing all restaurants. Ignacio M Subias had over ruled her refusal for us to eat at the other three restaurants and each time we had to go to guest services Desiree showed her anger each time. So as far as the a la carte restaurants we didn鈥檛 book this resort for this type of problem. The buffets all offered something different, try all three buffets plus the three beach buffets for lunch. Lots of variety!  Drinks: Good. Lots of variety. However, no Caesar鈥檚. The amount of alcohol varies at different bars.  Beach: Very nice. Lots of palapa trees, and hammocks.  Sports: Lots of stuff to do. However the advertising claims there are boogie boards. Again not true. According to Jeanette (Air Transat Rep at the hotel) claims that the hotel has no intentions of supplying these. The gym is a bit rusty but is better than some hotels we have stayed at in Punta Cana. The basics are there and are usually working. The male employee who supervises the gym is lazy and not helpful. When he would arrive at his own leisure in the morning (always late) he would not turn on the lights. Everyone would be in the dark; it was very hard to read the machines. We learnt to tell him to turn the lights on, which ticked him off. There are two pool tables at the Dominicana theatre, with nine balls and one broken cue. There are more pool tables at the Sports Bar but you have to pay for these. The casino is not worth going to. Very small, no A/C not much variety. Other hotels on the strip have much more superior casinos.  Spa: Friends of ours had a full spa treatment. Not recommended!!!! The pedicure consisted of, one client having the tip of his toe cut off, then rubbing alcohol applied to it. Then to top off his full body massage the employee strattled him and massaged his buttocks!!  Overall our holiday was okay. Each resort seems to offer something different, but lacks in another area. Would we go back to the Iberostar? NO. We did not appreciate having to go on vacation and have to fight for services that we were paying for as the advertising claimed. At this resort the customer has to spend too much time sorting out what is not true from Air Transat鈥檚 brochure on the Iberostar chain.

<Content>loved it!!!! from a teenagers point of view you go to alot of hotels and there is nothing to do. i went here and i was suprised at hoe many people had put this place down. its fantastic! the food is great! thers so much to choose from! i particularly liked it as there was so much goin on, sailing, windsurfing pool games everything.The disco was good even though it was very latin but it gave us a place to go after the entertainment finished and we didnt want to go to bed!! the rooms are very clean and i liked the little towl sculptures the cleaners made! i had no problem with workers stealing anything, i dont think you would have to worry about that! and from time to time they even left chocolates on our pillow!! all i can say is this place is great and caters for people of all ages! if you are bringing teenagers here you may have trouble getting them into the disco because it is over 16. (even though at the time i was 14 and im short and i had no problems!!)but i dont think you willl have to worry about them being bored!!! hope you enjoy your stay!!!!!!

<Content>We got verrrry sick :( We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from 10/24-10/31. We travel a bit and usually go 5-star which is what Bavaro claims to be. It was OK, the grounds are very pretty, the flamingos, ponds, etc., picturesque. The beach cabanas  loungers are lined up so tight to one another, u have no privacy, and when we were there, it wasnt crowded so you would think they put some away. The water was rough and i got bit/stung by something the 2nd day which made me afraid to go back in the ocean. On our 4th full day, I got sick to the point of delirium and my husband soon followed 12 hours later. That was pretty much the end of the trip. We never touch the tap water and used bottled to brush teeth. Something in the food or the drinks there, and again, nothing exceptional. The restaurants are good; the normal buffet areas are boring. The people are fantastic which is the best thing i can say, but it was very difficult to communicate with the staff who were always happy as can be, and more happy to wait on you which is unusual in the Carribean. While we were sick, hubby woke to find a roach crawling on him. Needless to say, its too 3rd world there for us and we wont be going back.

<Content>loved the bavaro Stayed At The Iberostar Bavaro 01/03/05-01/17/05. Let me first state that We have stayed at Iberostar resorts In The Myan riveria In Mexico 4 Times previouslly.(Love Iberostar) Although The bavaro was nice, It just didnt measure up to mexican Iberostars.My complaints areas follows. 1 no coffe makers In room .2 no newspapers anywhere In all three resorts to buy.3 had to call guest services for face cloths 4 times because maid forgot.4 requested wakeup call one morning, didnt happen. almost missed day trip. 5 My biggest complaint, Very high wind both two weeks there , Rain everyday many times. 6 language barrier was noticible, never had problems in mexico. (I dont speak Spanish) having listed several complaints, about this resort, I did manage to have a great time, but Honestly, I wouldnt go back to Dominican Republic Only because of the lousy weather. Overall the food and service Just didnt measure up to mexico Iberostars. but I did notice that the people In General seemed very Happy there at the resorts. I do no not think my vacaton was worth the $5600.00 USD that It cost us. I will go back to mexico next year.

USMy wife and I spent a week at the I Punta Cana starting Jan. 4, 05.The grounds are excellent and quite complete for a good AI experience.Our room was fine and quite spacious.The food was fine with extremely large selections available at the Buffet Restaurant. Contrary to some that have suggested food might be flavorless, everything was quite tasty. As with any location outside the US the steak may be tough- stick to the fish, pork and chicken that they grow locally. Their terrain doesn't provide forage enough for cattle!We were pleased with the entertainment provided which included groups playing near the Lobby Bar, The Evening Shows, and a piano player in the lobby that played during band breaks. THe Shows were expertly done with excellent effects and lighting and- unbelievably for these times with excellent audio balance- meaning you could hear something other than the Bass Player! Some beautiful voices among the Starfriends and excellent performers.The staff were all eager to do a good job. There was friendliness without intrusiveness.I certainly will be watching for the opportunity to stay at an Iberostar Hotel again.The pool was fine. My wife enjoyed the color of the ocean. I was not fond of the extreme tendency for the fine white sand to get into everything and stick to it. I'd take Puerto Plata over this anytime.I believe weather is supposed to be a bit better there in Jan than what we experienced. No badly rained out days, but at beach front the wind was continuous and caused nuisance choppy waves- hard to swim in but not surfable.I note that another reviewer mentioned problems with diaharea. My wife and I had no problems. We do take a few probiotic caps prior to and first days of travel to suspect locations. We were not aware of others having problems- the buffet lines were busy.A passenger on our flight said that at the nearly adjoining Riu Hotel he stayed at there was a very high rate of diaharea and that the illness was thought to be brought in by someone and spread a lot. Could happen anywhere people come and go and are in a dense setting.

<Content>This is absolute Paradise!! Just returned from our honeymoon (1/9-16/05) and it was great. The staff is absolutely wonderful and very courteous at all times considering they work extremely long shifts. Very romantic for evening walks.The grounds are impecable and always clean. The rooms are very nice and spotless. Food is average, not bad (of course you always miss your own). Drinks are drinks..nothing to complain about. There is always a variety at every bar. Beach: nice, clean a bit windy, but still warm and sunnyPool: water was cold but pool is beautiful and quite largeRestaurants: the one we liked the most was the Japanese (surprisingly) very good food. You also have La Ballena, which serves lobster- delicious. Lots of seafood.Nightly shows are good and keep you entertained.This place is true paradise. Those that give it a negative review are just picky and hard to please. If you're looking for the Ritz Carlton this is not the place, but it is still paradise.

<Content>Loved Bavaro My husband and I traveled to Punta Cana 1/8/05-1/15/05. I have 2 girls ages 6 and 9. Having stayed at Beaches Negril previously, we had high expectations. The Bavaro did NOT disappoint and we are well traveled, particular people. The hotel and grounds are beautiful with strolling peacocks and flamingos. The rooms were nicely appointed and very, very clean. We did tip our maid each day. Having the extra sitting area is worth the extra money, especially when you have children. The hotel offers a variety of activities and a kids club. Comparing the kids club to a Beaches property is difficult because the Bavaro does not have the same infrastructure (i.e., no Sega Center, waterslides, etc...) However, my children did archery and other activities that offset the infrastructure limits. Most importantly, the kids club staff is wonderful. In addition, each evening, the children have the opportunity to dance on stage before the evening showcase. This was incredible and my kids loved it!I do recommend you bring Acidophilus. Do not drink the water and brush your teeth with bottled water. You should be find but might still encounter some minor stomach problems. My husband and I were fine but my kids did have some minor, stomach irritations and the Acidophilus helped. What caused this - who knows? It could be the different food, water or simply all the hot dogs, fruit drinks and ice cream they ate.....We will return! PS - all the staff were incredible friendly...learning some Spanish before you go will help a lot! The buffets were good, sometimes the same but they offered a wide variety from which to choose. The restaurants at the Bavaro were the best - esp the French restaurant.... I do NOT recommend La Marimba at the Dominicana - it was below average and the only fare we did not like. Everything else was great.

<Author>BahamasBound
<Content>Wouldn't go back.. My husband and I traveled to Punta Cana (Iberostar) in May of 2003. After reading some of the most recent reviews, it doesn't seem like things have changed a whole lot.First off, I would have to say that the hotel staff was WONDERFUL! They always had a smile on their face and was willing to accomodate you in every way. They really did put every effort forth to make you feel comfortable. That was the only thing that was great....The beach was nice.. but you had to make sure you didn't drift too far to the right because there is an area set up directly next to the hotel on the beach where the locals try to haggle you to buy their stuff- and they don't take no for an answer. The hotel actually allows these people to come to the pool area to haggle you in the evening also. The henna tatoo artist is a rip off... he is directly next to the pool beach bar. He gave us one price before my husband got a tatoo and once he finished he charged us double. He said his conversion rates were different than the hotel conversion rates and we wound up paying $100 U.S. dollars for a cheesy dragon tatoo on his back.Next- The food was barely tolerable. We were there for a 4 night stay but by the 2 night- I was spending my whole time in the bathroom. I did not drink their water either. My husband came down with it the following day and it followed us home... needless to say we kept our stomach problems for 2 weeks after we got home.The island is very poor and the trip to the hotel is on a bumpy road through town where you see people living in their tiny cinderblock homes with no electricity or running water. It's very sad to see. You also see the Dominican police standing on the roads with huge guns guarding lord knows what.Our hotel room was not what you would say 3 star. Maybe 2. There weren't a whole lot of activities to keep you busy- unless you want to count the 10 times a day that they played aqua aerobics. The fitness center is a tiny room with about 5 pieces of ancient equipment. You have to make dinner reservations to eat in the restaurants but good luck.. when we got there, almost of the restaurants were full and we had to wind up eating buffet for all meals but one. There were not many american tourists there. Mainly Europeans and Latin Americans. English speakers were few and far between. Don't be shocked to see a lot of topless sunbathers and thongs as well as men in speedos.. trust me.. it's not a good thing.My husband and I are in our late 20's and would not recommend this for someone in this age group. We actually went on a 5 day Carnival cruise for a last vacation and had a BLAST!! Much cheaper also. We vow NEVER to return to D.R.- even if we were given a free trip. We would probably save the free trip to give to our worst enemy!This year we are going to visit the Bahamas. We've heard wonderful things and we are looking forward to it.Happy Travels!

<Content>Great time! We returned on Sunday after having spent 2 weeks @ the Iberostar Bavaro. Food:How anyone can complain about the food is beyond me. We went to the Japanese 3 times...excellent; the Mediterranean twice....appetizer buffet is excellent at this restaurant  if you don't like fish or seafood they will accomodate you with either chicken or steak as an entree. We went to the Gourmet  it was fair. All 3 of these a la carte restaurants are air conditioned so no smoking. We did not go to the Steak House which is not air conditioned nor is the main buffet air conditioned. We found the main buffet excellent with a varied menu each night. We did not eat @ the main buffet for lunch but rather @ the pool buffet. We left a tip (not required) at every meal  were treated real well in the main buffet. Room:Very spacious. Everything worked. Very quiet  we did not hear anything from our neighbours. We were in the 2400 section near the pool  beach in a ground floor room. Maid service was so so despite us leaving her a couple of bucks every day. We got clean towels every day but some days the room was not done till 4:00 PM. Floors were not washed down. Lotsa English channels on the TV. Beach:Nicest beach we have ever seen  we have been to Seven Mile Beach in Cayman, Dickenson Bay in Antigua, Palm  Eagle Beaches in Aruba  St Martin  La Romana. Water was pretty rough as it rained every day but you could still go into the ocean. Never a problem getting a chaise on the beach in front of the hotel. Lotsa topless women...many who shouldn't be.Pool:Huge. Lotsa junk in it from the cana off the roof near the swim up bar. We would get up early every day  get a shaded spot near the swim up bar part of the pool which was close to our room. Some days, you could not get a chaise @ the pool mid day there were so many people. Bars:Swim up bar was dead. We have been to the Iberostar in La Romana  lots more activity @ the swim up bar there. Bartenders had zero personality. Entertainment:We only went to one show. It was nothing special. Casino next door is a joke...and is not air conditioned. Air:We went Skyservice thru Signature vacations. Our flight down was OK ie left on time  we had 3 seats for the 2 of us. Coming home, we were told to check out @ 10:00 AM for a 11:00 pick up. By 11:30 no one came to pick us up. I made some dude phone to see what the story was  found out that instead of leaving @ 2:40 PM, the plane would now be leaving @ 3:00 AM!!! To their credit, Signature got us a room till Midnight after we had already checked out. Kudos to them for this. We were the only people from Toronto that were staying @ the Iberostar Bavaro so I don't know how they handled everyone else. So we basically got another day with a room till midnight at no additional cost to us. Coming home we also had 3 seats for the 2 of us which was great. Other:We were on the chloroquine regime. I got bit a few times, my wife did not. As I said, it rained everyday  there was quite an accumulation of water. The last couple days, they were spraying @ the resort for, I assume, mosquitos. I got a bit of a something but after popping a couple of immodium, all was well. We only drank bottled water but @ the bars, you really have no control re the ice which we were told was made from purified water. Other guests are mainly European ie French  German. Not that many from the US or Canada. Front desk was accomodating  check in  check out went smoothly. If you are going to tip, bring small bills in USD as hotel will NOT make change. We went for the beach, sun  to relax and feel that we got our money's worth. You have to remember you are not at a 4.5 or 5 star resort in the US or Canada but at a 4.5 or 5 star Dominican Republic resort.Anyone have any questions, I can be emailed @ elmerfudpucker2000@yahoo.com

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro pros and cons Just got back from Punta Cana and Iberostar Bavaro. First, some comments on DR:The people are very friendly. Even though their population is destitute, I was happy with the service and warmth of their reception. We went Jan 9-16, and the weather the first 4 days was not good. It rained off and on, with some sun and clouds otherwise. Sun lovers would be deeply disappointed going to DR, but I think it's the time of year. The last 3 days were sunny and hot as I had expected. comments on Apple: Flight service was great-best airline food around. Everything was on time and well planned. Their on site people push some questionable excursions, but that's their job. Don't go to the Manati Park- it's a joke.The resort:Beautiful lobby and grounds. The 'junior suite' rooms aren't all that impressive and are somewhat outdated, but if you have kids it's a good alternative to a normal room since the benches can be used as beds. The maid service is decent, although they don't change the sheets unless you throw them on the floor. I thought the rooms were acceptable at any rate. The pool is nice, but the water was cold. That didn't surprise me since many carribean locales don't heat their pools. If it was hotter you might not mind it, but again, the weather was 78-80 for a good part of this trip. The ocean and beach were nice, but the waves were probably a bit rough for the casual beach goer. The restaurants offered better choices than other all inclusives that I've seen. We really enjoyed the food for the first few days. But after that, we all fell victim to stomach problems. We avoided the water in every way possible, as well. We suspect it was from the fruit or vegetables, which are exposed to swarms of flies in the open air buffet areas. By the end of the trip, we were tired of the food, as they seemingly recycled the same dishes every day. We were all grateful to eat the airline food on the return. I enjoy eating a variety of foods, so it's not like I'm picky either. Other people on our return flight reported food related problems as well. Perhaps the best thing about the resort is the people that work there. They are hard working, and extremely eager to please. It really made the difference between a disappointing vacation and a fair one. On a side note, there are more Europeans here than Americans, so if you have any issues with that, consider yourself warned. All in all, I would say this might be a '6 golden apple' for the DR, but anywhere else I think a 5 is more like it. If you want a better beach and access to food outside your resort for similar dollars, think Cancun. DR was a nice place to visit, but we won't be going back.

<Content>Absolutely loved it! We've gone on many Celebrity cuises, as well as travelled throughout Europe, so I feel I can offer a fair assessment of the facility. While the food does not compare with Celebrity Century's food, which I consider outstanding, the quality was better than average. It was not as varied as I would have liked but I still enjoyed it. I absolutely disliked the French restaurant but perhaps I just don't enjoy French food as much as others. The staff was great, even when I drove them crazy looking for a watch which I misplaced. They were very gracious. While the entertainment is not Broadway quality, it was fun. As far as drinks, my brother drinks only Dewar's and I enjoy Frangelico after dinner, and both were always available. As a matter of fact, they probably lost money on my brother. I look forward to another stay at Iberostar Punta Cana sometime this year. In the meantine, I'm on my way to another one of my favorite places - Buenos Aires. Happy Travels.

<Content>No Problems - All Had a Good Time After reading some of the negative comments I was concerned, but turned out needlessly. Just returned from 4 days with wife and two sons ages 19 and 20. We all had a great time. For an all inclusive, the food was good. Rooms were nice and well maintained. Staff was mostly helpful (although sometimes frustratingly slow). Japanese restaurant was particularly good. We were able to eat at specialty restaurants all four nights.

<Content>Overrated We were a group of 14 who were stayed over New Year's. This review is a compilation of the opinions of all of us.FoodThis rates a 2. Breakfasts were unimaginative and the fruit selection was poor, as was its quality. Lunches were not much better, although the freshly prepared paella was very good. The dinners ranged from terrible to excellent. (The Japanese restaurant was particularly good.)DrinksThis rates a 2. The usual tropical drinks were for the most part, premade and of poor quality. We are used to enjoying fresh fruit in our drinks. The margueritas, banana daquiries, bahama mamas... were all poor to the point where we rarely ordered them. The draft local beer was good. Wine in the restaurants was poor. Bar alcohol was of poor quality.BeachThis rates a 5. The beach is spectacular. This is the only attraction to this resort. There are plenty of palapas, although surprisingly, no service on the beach. PoolThis rates a 4. The swim-up bar is in a dumb, out-of-the way location, which is why noone ever uses it.Check-inThis rates a 1. We had reserved rooms with king beds for our group. They completely messed up our emailed requests and we all had twin beds (although, after arguing with Johnny he finally succumbed and accomodated us.)ServiceI would give it a 3. The local bartenders were very friendly and responsive, although they understood next to no English. The servers in the restaurants were pleasant. All in all, this is a poor Iberostar. Its only redeeming factor is the beach - and regrettably - that was enough for us.

<Content>Happy New Year Stayed at the resort from December 26 until Jan 2. We were a party of 12 people. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. The only minor complaint was the peacocks releived themselves where ever they felt like. But the peacocks, the flamingos and most of the wildlife were beautiful. The peacocks would even eat out of your hand.The junior suites were spacious and nicely decorated and clean. We saw a small bug once. We had two rooms, an upper and a lower. The lower room smelled a little musty. The rooms were cleaned before noon each day and the maid accomadated all our requests.The pool was spacious and very clean. The resort was sold out but the pool never seemed crowded.The beach was also very cleam, except for one day when there was a lot of seaweed in the water and on the sand which i no fault of the resort. If you got to the pool or beach by 11am, you were able to get chairs.There were many topless women who shouldn't be and many overweight men in speedos. All the topless were on the beach.The people at the hotel were probably 60% american and 40 % european. The european people are very unfreindly and inconsiderate.The service at the restaurants and bars was very good and all our requests were accomodated. We tipped $1 or 2 to many waiters and bartenders and they were very greatful.We ate at the Mediterraen Rest, The Japanese and the Steak House. The japanese and the Steak house were very good, but the Mediterraen was fair. It seemed like they took the food from the buffet to serve us.The Buffet Rest was average. The food was not great and it seemed like they served the same food over and over. New Years eve they had huge shrimp and all the lobster tails you could eat which was nice. The drinks were adequate at best and no top shelf liquor was served. It is all local brands. The beer was local but good.The entertainment was all local talent and most of the shows were in spanish. The quality was adequate at best.Our only real complaint was that not enough of the help spoke english and sometimes the lanquage barrier was a hassle.Overall we had a great experiance and loved every minute of it. we would absolutely return to the Bavaro in the future.

<Content>had a great time!!!! We travelled to DR last March with a group of about 20, kids ranged in age from 2-15 yrs. We all had a great time! The food was good, what you would expect at a resort, the drinks were great, the staff was very friendly and always in good humour. The people in our group with smaller kids found the kids club not great, difficult to figure out when it was open and such. The older kids loved the ping-pong tables, watersports, pools and of course the beach!! The waves were great fun but hold onto your little ones! The rooms were a good size, comfortable and clean (could use a little sprucing up though cosmetically). We had rooms close to the beach which was great for those with small kids. Overall we had a great time, drank only the bottled water which was in great supply all the time, no one got sick!!

<Content>Great stay 11 beautiful days ! ( with only one rainy ) - 9/12/2004 to 21/12/2004.Great place, great stay, great people, great rooms, great pool and nice beach. This is a really luxury resort.We were next to the pool and next to the sea so it was really great.We will go back for sure next year !I think you can't be disappointed if you stay at this hotel. People who are sick during their stay it's , in my opinion, due to they are not taking care about what they eat and what they drink !

<Content>Nice but Got Sick My ex-girlfriend Charla and I stayed at the Iberostar last year and liked almost everything about it. You see, both of us became extremely ill, and we're still not sure what caused it. We suspect it was the water, which we used only to brush our teeth. We didn't overdrink or overeat, so it wasn't those things. Regardless of why we got sick, it wasted at least two days of our vacation, having to rush to the bathroom every 30 minutes or so. So be warned. Besides that, the resort is fantastic, except maybe for the local merchants who try and pressure you into buying overpriced stuff. Negotiate and stick to your guns! And don't drink the water! Tom

<Content>Poor second to Iberostars in Mexico We just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro having stayed Dec. 17-22, and found it to be a poor example of what Iberostar has to offer. We have visited 5 of the Iberostar resorts in Mexico, and all of them are better than this one. The food is better. The staff is friendlier, and the rooms are nicer. I love staying with Iberostar, but my experience at the Iberostar Bavaro was very disappointing. In fact, I do not plan to ever go back to the Dominican Republic. Period.I was appalled at how rude some of the staff was at Iberostar Bavaro - especially at the lobby bar. Simple requests are ignored whether you speak English or Spanish. Food was fair to poor.Rooms have a musty smell that permeates your clothing and goes home with you.Although the beach is somewhat nicer than the ones in Mexico, they are so crowded that is does not matter.Sorry, but the Dominican Republic makes Mexico look like Switzerland!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

<Content>BEAUTIFUL PLACE FOR A WEDDING My family and I (15 people) were at the Iberostar Bavaro the week of Thanksgiving for my son's wedding. The wedding was on Thanksgiving day - on the beach. I have never been out of the country so I was very excited to be there! I have absolutely nothing negative to say. The room, grounds, food, people were all wonderful. The wedding was beautiful and the staff went out of their way to make it a very special occasion. I was amazed at how hard working the staff is. You could see the same person in the morning leading arobics, in the afternoon leading games, in the evening in the show and at the disco at midnight judging the dance contest, always with a friendly word and a smile. If anyone has a negative opinion of this place, they are imposible to please. Both a wonderful trip and a wonderful memory for us all!

<Content>No exclamation marks in this review!!! This is not our first all-inclusive vacation, so we have a few points of reference. In fact, re-reading my last review posted at http://www.debbiescaribbeanresortreviews.com/mexico/fiestaa.html (search for word 鈥淭ucan鈥?on the page) amused me since so many things are alike there and here. In addition to providing a general review, I鈥檒l try to cover some of the questions I had prior to visiting this resort that I couldn鈥檛 find answers to on this and other boards.Overall, the resort consists of two wings, IB Punta Cana and IB Dominicana. For all practical purposes they are the same resort, i.e. they share cafeterias, restaurants, facilities, etc.IB Bavaro is adjacent to IB Dominicana and consists of many 2-story villas instead of massive buildings, thus it is more spread out.Rooms (*** - ****)Each wing consists of an older building (on the left side it is called Punta Cana) and a newer building (again, on the left side it is Punta Canita). The newer building is closer to cafeterias and the lobby and further from the ocean. The newer buildings have nicer looking and better equipped rooms (i.e. iron/ironing board, phones in the bathrooms, etc), the older building has proximity to pool and ocean and, from many 2-3 floor units, a real ocean view 鈥?a rarity in this type of AI resorts.To families with children, like ours, they pretty much automatically offer Jr. Suites when available. However, it is nothing more that a larg-ish room with a sofa. With gentle prodding we were given a real suite (in the older building), i.e. 2 adjoining rooms, 2 TVs (thanks G-d!), 2 balconies and a view of the pool and the ocean. They have rather few of those, but this is a low season and relatively few families were staying in the resort. The benefit of having several massive buildings, which are rather pleasant looking, is that they make the resort pretty compact overall. The walk from anyplace to anyplace (not including Bavaro) did not exceed 5 minutes.Special mention about electrical outlets. They are on North American current, i.e 110 volts. However, the receptacles are designed to accept both North American plug with two flat polarized prongs, as well as the European plug with two round prongs. As a result the outlet is a bit recessed, unlike the flush ones used in North America. So, if you have a North American appliance with a small plug (like an iron) it will work without any adapter. If your appliance has prongs sticking out of the power adaptor body (like cell phones, PDAs, cameras, etc) you will need a regular NA-to-European converter to use the power outlets. You can bring one from home, no need to buy it at the resort.Service (***)We felt the service was average. If you need something delivered to your room, don鈥檛 assume a single phone call would do it. It took us 2 days to get an ironing board and on every call it was promised 鈥渞ight away.鈥?br/>On your arrival there is a 4L (1 Gallon) jug of water for you brushing/drinking needs. When it is finished they bring you a new one.Food (***)More mediocre than average (average being resorts in Mexican Riviera Maya for us). The blended fruit drinks were diluted with so much water and sweetened with so much sugar that they tasted like, well, 鈥渟weetened water.鈥?The usual tired breakfast/lunch/dinner buffet spread was there, but nice little touches we鈥檇 found before (themed buffets, crepe stations, real granola and variety of nuts for breakfast) were missing. We were not looking to going back to the buffet after the first day in the resort. Fortunately, we didn鈥檛 have to. Given that the resort was not nearly at full capacity we were able to go to specialty restaurants every night. Of these restaurants we felt the newest one - Oriental restaurant (La Pagoda*****) was by far the best. It was tastefully decorated, had the best service and food. Don鈥檛 expect Nobu, but at least a large proportion of the food was genuinely good. We ate there twice.Second place was shared by the steakhouse**** (it has tables placed right on the sand at the beach, so leave your fancy footwear in your room for this one) and the Tropical**** restaurants. Both delivered reasonably tasty food (Apple cake 鈥?really a Napoleon tart 鈥?was delicious). Dead last were the 鈥淕ourmet鈥?restaurant 鈥淟a Sibilia鈥?* and the Mexican restaurant**. Usually bad food was accompanied by impersonal service. At Mexican, when I tried the churrasco steak, found it to be much worse than at both the steakhouse and the Tropical, and mentioned it to the waiter, the waiter simply lifted the almost untouched plate and took it away without offering a replacement.The last two restaurants are better off skipped in my opinion.Beach (*****)The beach was really nice and clean, with good sand and plenty of palapas (thatched huts) offering shade. As usual, people reserved the choice spots early on, but good locations could still be found pretty late. The near constant trade winds made the weather seem temperate even in the middle of the day. Alas, the only places they have hammocks hanging is in the shops 飦?KidsOur daughter loves the 鈥渕ini-clubs鈥?and was looking forward to going to one here. The club is open from 10 to 5, and then they can take the kids for dinner at 7, then mini-disco at 8, followed by another disco till 9:20. Our daughter became very attached to one of the counselors, but overall we felt that while they provided impressive time coverage, their programs were not as imaginative as what we have seen in other resorts.ExcursionsUsually I pride myself on being quite comfortable with geography of various places we visit. However, going to Punta Cana, I thought we were going to the Caribbean side of the island. Turned out to be the Atlantic side (the wind and the waves). So, we were curious about the 鈥渞eal Caribbean鈥? Both the diver shop on premises and our tour operator 鈥淎pple Vacations鈥?offered a trip to Saona Island. The diver shop trip included some snorkeling/scuba time (2 30-minute periods) and the 鈥淎pple Vacations鈥?one did not, but instead offered more time on the island.We opted for the diver shop trip because I wanted to get my daughter to try snorkeling and thought doing it with all the nice fish swimming around would be a lot more fun. Also, the diver shop offers 10% discount if you pay cash, so it helps to have cash on hand. The all-day trip was $71 for an adult with 50% off for kids. The trip was worthwhile overall 鈥?the bus takes you across the Higuey province with a chance to see some of the countryside, then at IB Hacienda Dominicus on the Caribbean side you get your gear and switch into a speedboat for a nice ride to the Isla Saona 鈥?real picture-perfect island. Some warnings 鈥?on the Caribbean side with no trade wind, it felt a lot hotter and the sun was harsher. Also, bring your aqua shoes if you have them as the sand on the island is full of broken shells, so it is hard to get in and out of the water with bare feet.As an aside, we really liked what we saw of IB Hacienda Dominicus. It is obviously a newer resort than IB Punta Cana and much MUCH more appealing in its d茅cor. We鈥檇 try it on a future trip.Some downsides to be aware of that they don鈥檛 tell you about when they sell you the trip:1. The snorkeling places they take you to are really nothing special, not the rich coral reefs you see elsewhere. It was ok for me, my daughter picked up snorkeling on the second try and that was my main objective, but if you are going specifically for snorkeling you might be disappointed.2. They say the bus trip across to the Caribbean side takes 1.5 hr each way. In our case it was 2 hrs (plus the bus was late for 30 minutes) going there and 3 hrs coming back (with an obligatory stop in a 鈥渟pecially selected鈥?restroom/souvenir shop. This made for unexpected 5 hrs on the bus which left most of us pretty tired and made some miss their dinner reservations.Shopping There is a string of shops on the beach both 5 minutes to the right of the resort and about 15-20 minutes to the left. Their prices are mostly high even after bargaining. They do have a large selection of paintings by local artists in addition to the usual stuff they sell in such places. Some of the paintings were good. We bought one, by offering 25% of the asking price and finally settling on the 50%. You can pay by a credit card (we did), it doesn鈥檛 seem to make a difference to them. Just watch out if you bargain in your own currency, they may use an inflated rate when converting the negotiated price into pesos (they tried this with us), so it pays to know the current exchange rate.MalariaTwo days before our departure, I found out that there is an outbreak of Malaria in the Punta Cana area, probably because of recent flooding caused by the hurricanes (thank you, Tripadvisor.com). You can find more up-to-date info here http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/2004/mal_dr1202_e.html and a bit less info here http://www.cdc.gov/travel/caribean.htm.With two days left we couldn鈥檛 start the drug usually prescribed for this region - chloroquine(Aralen), so we took Malarone instead. We had no visible side effects from the drug. Also, we haven鈥檛 really seen any mosquitoes during the week, again trade winds, plus relative lack of vegetation on the resort grounds, helped. Toward the end of the trip we even stopped slathering ourselves in the evenings in 25% DEET insect repellent since there were none to repel. We did get bitten a few times by somethings, but I鈥檇 say in this particular resort the overall exposure is pretty low. Still, you might consider talking to your doctor about getting meds.ConclusionOverall, the resort was clean and had all the amenities we expected, although not quite up to the standards we鈥檇 seen elsewhere. The good weather and a nice beach made for a nice week with the negatives being relatively unimportant, but I doubt we come back here again.If you have any questions, feel free to email me at ygulko at isg-inc.com.

<Content>Wonderful people! I just returned form the Iberostar Punta Cana. What a cute airport! The reason I rated this trip so high is because of the people. I am a travel agent and have been many places. I think the Dominicans ( I hope that is right) are the warmest most outgoing people I have ever encountered. My only complaint about the staff was at check-in and check-out! Not a good experience on either end, luckily everything else was good enough to not leave a bad taste in my mouth. The resort was ok. I have been to the Iberostar Tucan in the Riviera Maya and that resort far outshines this one. The grounds were beautiful and always being worked on. The building I was in needed a little work in the cleanliness dept. On close inspection corners were not cleaned. When we first opened our drapes a tube of Chapstick rolled out from under the curtain. What does that tell you! I think they just need to do a more thorough job because the bathroom was very clean. We never got wash clothes after using ours the first day though. Food our first night left much to be desired but it did get a little better after that. The Steakhouse was pretty good and so was the Star Rock Cafe. I love a good breakfast buffet and so I was alittle disappointed here. I went to relax and read a few good books and that is exactly what I did! Water in both the ocean and the pool were alittle cold for my taste so I didn't get in much. Also lost a little money in the casino!As it has been said many times it is a very European destination so be prepared.Email me if you have any questions.

<Content>Great All-inclusive Vacation My husband and I (age53) just returned on 12-6-04 from a marvelous week at the Iberostar in Punta Cana. We found the ages to be mixed with few school-aged children due to the time of the year. We stayed in the Punta Cana wing which is on the quiet side of the hotel. The Dominicana side is where most of the activity takes place. It's a place where you can keep busy all day or choose to have nothing but peace and quiet. Even though there are plenty of activities it is never intrusive; no one pesters you or pushes you to join in. The entire staff is excellent; they are polite and go out of their way to be accomodating. The Star Friends are great and speak several languages,as do most of the non-American guests. I speak a little Spanish and it was fun to be able to use it, though most of the staff you need to have conversation with speaks English except the maids, some busboys, chefs, etc.The resort is very clean and the housekeeping service is outstanding. I did leave the maid $2 each morning but I feel I would have gotten good service anyway. No one there seems to be looking for a tip; they just take pride in their work and care about how they are seen by the guests and their superiors. My only complaint about the room is that it is too dark - needs more light.The beach is very nice but not exceptional. The sand is golden, not white (if you care) and there are waves (a disappointment for me and I didn't know before we went.) The pools and pool area are lovely. I would have liked to be allowed 2 towels but we were only allowed 1 apiece. I wish I had brought an extra from home. I understand the Iberostar in La Romana has a better beach (if you are looking for white sand and calm water). I'd like to try it, maybe next time, but it will definitely be Iberostar. The food is pretty good; not gourmet but not bad. You have to be open-minded. There is always something you can find and the fruits and vegetables are always fresh and beautiful. In fact, in the buffet they are constantly refeshing and replenishing. My husband, who has a somewhat sensitive stomach, liked the food but had some digestive trouble with the beef. He didn't get sick, just had an upset stomach. I wasn't bothered at all and I ate and drank everything. You can choose three dinners a week at the gourmet restaurants but if you want to try for more you can go to the reservation desk after 4PM and see if there are any last minute openings. We managed to eat in all of them! Our favorite was the Japanese (which was originally our last choice). It was really more Asian, having Chinese, Thai and other Asian food. Their fish was excellent as was the duck. We also liked the Mexican and tropical restaurants a lot. We would skip the steakhouse, La Cana, (though we ate breakfast and lunch there sometimes - right up from the beach). We would also skip La Sibila, the gourmet restaurant, even though we love gourmet restaurants at home. The restaurant is attractive with a great waitstaff - it has it all except for the food! The lobster was so overcooked I couldn't get it out of the shell. I heard this from others also. Overall, the food is NOT going to be what you get at home but it is still pretty good and, based on other all-inclusives I have been to, it is way above par.Shopping is virtually non-existent unless you are basically looking for island trinkets. It was even hard to find gifts to bring home but I didn't much care - we went to relax! And don't count on the airport for last minute items. Mostly all they have is duty-free booze, cigarettes, and perfume. It seems Iberostar has the formula right. What we enjoyed most was the warm sun, relaxing, walking on a seemingly endless beach, warm evenings under the stars, wonderful music and dancing, entertaining shows, wonderful staff, lots of available activities, no rudeness or intrusive behavior, and the chance to simply escape the cares of everyday life in a clean, beautiful environment. It was great not to need to carry a wallet and have all this for a ridiculously low price. We would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Relaxing vacation!! We (2 couples ages 27-30) traveled to the DR in Feb. 2004. We had a wonderful time getting away from the city life. The Iberostar Punta Cana was relaxing. The rooms were nice enough, no special perks. The food was average on the buffets but the specialty restaurants were better. The all-inclusive drinks are very small so you may want to bring your own big cup. The beach and pool were very nice but it gets crowded so get your spot early. People will leave towels on the beach chairs before they go to breakfast so you may want to claim an area very early. My only complaint was the casino. The staff was not very knowledgable to put it nicely. I would definately recommend this hotel but do not expect 5 star accomidations.

<Content>Incredable resort We just returned from a wonderful week at the Iberostar Bravara in Punta Cana and feel it was absolutely the best trip we have ever had. Everything went as my agent planned it and when we arrived at the resort, we were taken care of as though we were world class travlers. Our room was very clean, bright and cheerful, the grounds were absolutely gorgeous and the food, especially the variety and choices, were exceptional. The pool, the beach the flowers, etc. were simply breathtaking. I enjoyed the entertainment nightly and I found it nicer then my stay at Runaway Beach in Jamaica. The most difficult problem is the language barrier but we generally found someone who could help us. I highly reccommend this place and would certainly return there over and over. The staff employed here are courteous, pleasant, and treated us like family. Plenty to do and excellant weather.

<Content>loved the ilerostar bavaro wow what a holiday stayed two weeks and enjoyed every minute. Grounds were incredible grounds workers must work 24/7 as the grounds were incredibly clean and beautiful. Beach was awesome, always able to get a chair either in the sun or shade. Pool was large and always able to get charis there as well. Really enjoyed the swim up bar. Speaking of bars there are plenty and you do not have to wait for a drink, drinks are stronge recommend you bring a travel cup that way your drinks at the ocean and or pool will stay cold. The staff was very nice and always went out of their way for us, we traveled with friends and at the buffet restaurant the staff always had a table for four available and if one of us wasn't there they always asked why. Some of us got a little bored with the buffet but for the most part it was very good. Try the omlettes when you are there as well as the pasteries they are great!! Ala carte restaurants were very good we went to the Japanese one twice. Highlr recommend that you go on a tour to Saona Island it was so worth it clear blue water and calm ocean see plenty of star fish as well as great shells. The Bavero Runner tour was also good and a great way to see the country side. Staff at the Bavaro were all very nice and always willing to help and very friendly. Would highly recomment that anyone traveling to Punta Cana stay here we were told by people that have been to other resorts that this is the nicest and my husband and the other couple that we traveled with agree as we have also traveled to numerous other places we will come back here.

<Content>Great Trip despite the rain. We took a 7 day Apple vacation and ended up staying for 10 days. The additional 3 days were spent at the Dominicana - the Bavaro was booked. Both resorts are very similar - the Bavaro was a little more top notch than the Dominicana in the service and the food. I also noticed more families at the Dominicana. I would only stay at the Dominicana again if the price difference between the 2 resorts was significant enough. We e-mailed and faxed the resort prior to our trip for a 2nd floor beach room. We got neither - but our room was centrally located so we were OK with it. Every morning I opened the curtains and found 3-5 peacocks on our balcony - they were beatiful and worth having a first floor room. We went in Mid-Nov so we were at the end of the rainy season. Despite the rain we were able to still go to the beach - the ocean was so much warmer than the pool! I think I only went in the pool twice. We tried several of the restaurants in both resorts. Being in the midwest -we are spoiled with good steaks and dairy products. The steaks and dairy at the resorts were passable but definitely not what we are used to. The buffet at the Dominicana was OK - the Bavaro was identical WITH some much better extras. Don't be afraid to use the buffet only - the restaurants are mediocre.One suggestion I have for dress is to bring several light cotton long sleeved shirts. I had mostly strappy tops and halters and was cold most evenings. Also - it did seem more dressy at night. I only brought 2 dresses and a few skirts for evening - I really needed something for every evening. Guys are more casual so don't panic. Although the loose tropical shirts (untucked) seemed to be the look with shorts or pants day or night.Overall we had a great time - the workers at the Bavaro are so friendly and happy (not so friendly and happy at the Dominicana). the activities and shows are a bit cheesy but you are there to have fun so drink up (watch out for the Mama Juana - it tastes the same in both directions) and enjoy!

<Content>Had an amazing time ... We have just come back from an amazing one week stay in Punta Cana at the Iberostar Bavaro and all I can say is that if you are planning on heading there, you have nothing to worry about. Before booking our trip, we read all the reviews on the resort and I also have to add that everyone was right, the place is great. Actually, we were amazed at the service. Everyone at the hotel, was friendly and curteous.The food is unbelievable. You will be pleasantly surprised with the variety. Make sure to make your reservations at the restaurants well in advance to guarantee the time that you prefer.The room's were great. Very spacious and very clean. I recommend that you email the resort a week in advance to get the best room, preferably on the second floor, to stay away from any bugs and ask for a pool side or ocean front view room. Although, I did find out that it is very difficult to get an ocean front view because those rooms are usually booked in advance. The only negative is the ocean. The sand is white, but the ocean has a lot of waves and it isn't a clear blue ocean, but that didn't stop us from enjoying our swim or enjoying our time on the beach and hearing the waves. One word of caution: bring all supplies with you. Don't leave home without anything that you might potentially need because everything at the resort is expensive. Also, when you are leaving the resort make sure that your luggage doesn't weigh more then your alotted amount because they will charge you at the airport and it's a phenomenal amount. Don't overpack.If you are heading there in the month of Decemeber, you will be pleasantly surprised on how beautiful the grounds look at night time. They have lights everywhere and it's breath taking.Enjoy your time there, you will love the grounds, the people, the hotel and the food. I am sure you will come back home as happy as we were.

<Content>Please read if you're "nit-picky" like me We just got back from our honeymoon trip to Iberostar Bavaro in the Dominican Republic. Overall it was a great trip and I would recommend this hotel and destination to anyone. However, if you would like to hear some nit-picky details and little pet-peeves, then please read on.First off, I must say that the staff was excellent, the shows were great and once we got afew bartenders on the payroll so to speak, we were never without a drink.A few of my minor dislikes are as follows, please read these because this is all information I wish I had prior to leaving:CIGARETTES: Be sure to bring smokes from your home country or buy them at the Putna Cana duty free shop in the Airport. I was shocked to find out that most packs of American cigarettes in the resort store cost 4-5 dollars American. On the way home we found that the Duty Free was selling packs for about a buck to a buck and a quarter.MEDICATION: In the resort store, the smallest bottle of Pepto Bismal (which came in handy) was 15 dollars US. Bring lots of these items if you expect to be using them: Pepto, Gravol, Asprin, Ammodium and so on. THE RESORT STORE: Basically, don't buy anything domestic in the resort store. My wife and I went to get 2 bags of chips for a movie night in the room. 8 dollars US per bag...phew!!!BEACH VENDORS / CIGARS: Basically anything you see in any of the resort stores, you can get off a beach vendor. You also have the ability to barter with them, including the cost of cigars. I found that they would usually quote you a price of about 135 US for a box of average cigars, but I would leave with 2 boxes for 40 or 50 bucks. I think the going price is about 20 US per box.ROOM CLEANING: Overall, they did a great job. I didn't like the fact that they showed up at a random time each day. One day it could be 8 in the morning, the next day could be noon. And, if you don't want to get interupted during anything, make sure you lock the deadbolt because they knock once and waltz right in your room.Email me if you have any further questions or commentsThanks

<Content>You'll enjoy the Bavaro We recently returned from a week long stay at the Bavaro. Overall we had a really nice time.The hotel is on large and sprawling grounds. The vegetation is beautiful with peacocks wandering the grounds. We emailed asking for an oceanside view and a king size bed. We received a second floor suite with the king size bed directly overlooking the pool. It was comfortable, with a sunken living room area and balcony, tv, a/c/ceiling fan and a good size bathroom. There was a plate of fruit, small bottle of rum and two T-shirts when we arrived. Maid service was very good. We left $2/day and the room was always cleaned to our satisfaction. The minibar was stocked everyday.The Bavaro is next to the Dominicana and the Punta Cana. However, the Bavaro accomodations are suites in bungalow/villa style, not just a room in a large building. Also you are able to use the facilities of the other hotels. The beach is wonderful. The ocean was very clear and not too wavy. The sand is powdery and cool. We had no trouble finding a palapa at any time of the day. We also took advantage of the parasailing offered and it was fun! The pool was large, attractive and freeform with part of it being zero entry. There's a nice pool bar. We also were always able to find palapas at the pool, no matter the hour. You can reserve jacuzzis ahead of time at the spa. The spa also has a full range of services, albeit at U.S. prices. The food was mediocre. However, the grilled meats, omelets, coffee and fresh croissants at the pool restaurant were good. The evening buffet was not good. For the specialty restaurants, the reservation system is complicated and not well explained. We ate the Tropical and the Mexican restaurants at the Dominicana, and the Mediterranean (seafood) and Gourmet (lobster) restaurants at the Bavaro. None were spectacular, although the best were the Tropical and Mediterranean. Only some of the restaurants have a/c. A few of us experienced minor stomach problems. The hotel does a great job with the drinks. They are strong and we really enjoyed the banana daquiris, pina coladas, mojitos and Presidente beer.We went on an ATV excursion with Quad Safari. The trip was worth it to see the countryside, but I strongly advise using a different tour company. We were mostly driving on the highway! The ATVs were falling apart, they provided no drinks, the tour leaders were rude and they did not stop at scheduled parts of the tour like the beach and the school, but made us go to the tourist trap shops. The animation staff has shows each evening. These are not professional stage actors but they try hardand have so much energy. They are the same people down by the pool leading activities in the morning. They were friendly, but not overly pushy. They work 11 days straight from 9:45 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. then have 3 days off. Some of the other staff were really pleasant but others downright rude. When we tried to make dinner reservations at guest services, the lady refused to explain the system or restaurant options. Also we once ordered room service. After several calls and an hour and a half they said that the kitchen didn't have time to do our order at all. On the other hand, two members of the front desk staff went out of their way to coordinate a trip to see a Dominican League baseball game for my husband and his friend. This was very nice indeed. Overall we really had a nice time at the resort. Hope this review helps. Feel free to email me with any questions if you like.

<Content>Great food, fun and people. I loved the place. I came with my family for 10 days over the summer and it was great. The shows weren't very good, but the beaches were great. I didn't like the begging salespeople, but that's not the hotel's fault. The room was cool and cozy and the food was wonderful!!!I loved it being all-inclusive so that I could go anywhere and do almost anything for free. I wish the banana boating and U-tubing was incuded though like sandals. We did them twice and enjoyed them alot and I figure if it were included then we would have done it more. Overall it was great, I would go back and I suggest it for you. Best of all the people were VERY sweet.

<Content>A beautiful resort We just arrived back from a one-week trip to the Iberostar Bavaro. I concur with all the positive reviews of the resort. It is beautiful, lushly landscaped with a huge free-form pool and a white-sand beach with extremely clear water. Although the Bavaro side is older, we preferred it to the Dominicana/Punta Cana side as it is more intimate (the rooms are in eight-unit buildings with gardens rather than a single huge building). Our first floor room faced the pool but was surprisingly quiet, and our air-conditioning worked well. We had a nice sunken living room area with a big table and a comfortable king-sized bed.The food is generally mediocre, so I'll tell you what we felt were the bright spots. At breakfast, the pastries and croissants are excellent. The poolside lunch buffet is better than what is served in the main dining room; one day, the staff cooked an enormous pot of paella with lobster, shrimp and mussels. It was outstanding. They also grill marinated meat and kebobs that are pretty good. The pizza, of all things, is also good.The gourmet restaurant, which has a set five-course menu with a grilled lobster tail entree, is pretty good. We also enjoyed the Caribbean restaurant, which was the best meal I had there. The Mexican restaurant has wonderful desserts including a tres leches (three milks) cake. It's true a lot of the food in the specialty restaurants is the same as what is served at the buffets, but it is made to order and is a nice break from the communal atmosphere of the buffet.A strong point is the drinks. The bartenders do not skimp on the alcohol. Despite the resort's size you never seem to be more than a few feet from a bar serving pina coladas, daquiries, mojitos or any number of other cocktails. Dominican beer is also excellent.The staff ranged from extremely helpful (two front desk clerks, Jesus and Rosa, called personal friends to help us attend a baseball game in La Romana) to unhelpful (a woman who refused to take dinner reservations; a room service order that never arrived). Generally though the staff is quite attentive and friendly and they seem to like Americans. Attempting to speak a little Spanish also helps. The landscaping is a sight to behold, as are the flamingos and blue peacocks who roam the grounds. Overall, a great place to spend a vacation.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel Had a very nice time!! The food is delicious and a lot to choose from at the buffets plus the speciality restuarants are incredible - make sure you book these right when you check in. I didn't get sick from the food or the water. I drank all the bottled water located in the mini bar in your room.Our room was huge and had all the shampoos and body washes included plus a blowdryer which I let my hair air dry, but if you do your hair, make sure you bring your own and make sure you check the adapter situation as well. The hotel is immaculate. The shows are entertaining. There is a small casino - as long there is Roulette, I'm a happy camper. There are little huts down on the beach where you can bargain for trinkets, t-shirts etc - make sure you bargain. I thought I would be able to get some magnets at the airport before we flew home, but was not spending $8-10 for one. The airport has the duty free liquor and cigarettes which were bargains. I got some bottles for Christmas gifts, but I think the cartons of cigarettes were $18!! They have last minute gifts, but you will be paying!The stores at the hotel are pretty expensive. The drinks: I like blender frozen drinks. There are no blenders, but pre-made mixtures. I drank them and they are still good. There is also good wine. They serve blah wine at dinner, but ask for the good wine.I swam w/ the dolphins at Dolphin Island not Manati Park...it was my first time and I liked it...it was about $85 - supposedly Dolphin Island is new and will be expanding next year, but you are swimming in the ocean. I also got a massage at the hotel which was to die for and well worth it...$50 for an hour. There is so much to do at the hotel - volleyball, water aerobics, air rifle shooting, banana boats, parasailing etc etc etc - you never have to leave. The beach is gorgeous!! Have a blast...I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great time!! My finace and I returned from the Iberostar Bavaro yesterday and we had a great time. We have travelled a lot and thought this was one of the nicest resorts. The premises were very clean, people were very nice, the food was quite good-loved the japanese restaurant. My fiance has been sick for the past few days and we spoke to alot of other travellers who got sick too. Please be careful not to drink the water-even brush your teeth with bottled water. Make sure the water is bottled in the restaurants-not just filtered. Any time you go away, there is always a chance you can get sick so make sure you take the proper precautions.Also, I had e-mailed the resort for a room near the pool on the second floor and there was no problem at all. The first 2 days of our trip it rained, but in retrospect, it let us catch up on our badly neede sleep. I highly recommend this resort!!

<Content>I will go back !! What an absolutely incredible experience. The staff was the best and would accomidate you in any way. The resort inself is kept imaculate. If you track sand from the beach to the pool bar, it is swept off of the tile before you even return to the beach. The drinks are very good and if you want it made stronger all you have to do is order it Mucho. The lowest rating would probably be the food, which was good but not great, they do not use a lot of spice because of the amount of international travelers and they have to cater to everyone. I read this in a reveiw before I left and just took some Lawry Seasoning salt with me. It fixed it right up. I read a couple reveiws where they thought some of the guest were rude, well anyone who thinks that would probably think that anywhere they go. Everyone was fabulous and I was able to meet people from all over the world and exchange emails and other contact information. We did the Tiki Snorkeling excursion, and it was the best time of any excursion I have ever done. I also met the most incredible woman on the face of the earth there, so sorry she is taken now, but I will go back, It could be for my wedding someday. So if you want to go enjoy a beautiful clean friendly fun vacation. I recommend it. To bad I can only give it 5 stars. Bravo to all of the staff who are the best. God Bless.. Jim from Ohio

<Content>Great Place for a great price We have just returned from Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana on 11/17/04. This place was beautiful. I cannot say enough about how friendly the people were, the grounds were beautiful, the ocean was aqua-green/blue and warm, the sand was soft(colored like cookie batter) and the food was delicious. They really treat you well and make you feel at home. The waiters and waitresses remember little things that you talk to them about and will bring them up in conversation the next day or even a couple of days later demonstrating that they really do place a high importance on making you feel comfortable.My girlfriend and I got engaged on the island and told our cleaning lady...we went to the beach and came back to a table set up with fresh fruit, wine and towels all folded a special way with flowers all over them...it was incredible.The rain was few and far between...just one full day of clouds and the rest of them 95% sunny.The food took a little getting used. There was plenty of choices, too many! We didnt have any issues with stomach aches or any other ailment for that matter.I recently read some of the reviews of this place and I was a little discouraged. After vacationing there, I have no idea what planet some of these people are from, but I can tell you this...its a great place to travel...and its cheap! people forget how much drinks and food costs and therefore expect gourmet food for free...its close to gourmet but not quite as tastey. The 4 of us(another couple and us) read the reviews and figured they had to be at a different resort. The key is to go to the Iberostar Bavaro. The others next to it also called Iberostar arent quite as nice and it was noticeable. Hopefully this review helps!

<Content>loved the hotel, but don't count on prieto We loved the Iberostar Bavaro and Punta Cana - great beach, pool, food, accommodations, entertainment, weather, etc. Just don't count on Frankie with Prieto Tours - he only shows up half the time when he says he'll be there, so don't waste too much of your vacation waiting for him.

<Content>Amazing week - Loved the Resort My wife and I just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro on 11/12/04 and had a wonderful week.First, I鈥檝e included my email address for those of you who may have questions that I might be able to help. Most of the negative replies about this resort come from people who don鈥檛 include their email address because they are too embarrassed. They failed to do the proper research on the Resort and when they got there didn鈥檛 like what they found, shame on them. Then they want to blame Apple Vacations or the Resort for not providing them with what they thought would be provided. My wife and I read the reviews for a month prior to making our reservations and we had prepared for the resort and our vacation. Most of the complainers wanted more then what they paid for. You can鈥檛 beat the price for what you get what a bang for our buck. We received roundtrip air (Non-stop) transfers, all inclusive for 8 days for under $2,400. The Iberostar is an international chain catering to the international vacationers (Including Americans) and the Bavaro is a Dominican Resort. If you鈥檙e not interested in a little adventure and a mix of guests stay home and be miserable. Don鈥檛 go all the way down there and be miserable then cry about what bad time you had and how bad the Resort is. We met nice people from Jersey and Chicago and from all over the world, you need to make your own party.A number of complaints were about the international guests and how they were pushy ect. No problem. We had no problem with them or their traditions. However they don鈥檛 tip a cent and since we did, I know we got better treatment then they did. The Dominican people went out of their way to always say hello and help you with your every need. I knocked the sliding door off the tracks and reported it to the front desk and a repairman came within an hour and fixed it. (I tipped the desk clerk and the repairman) Tips go a long way for better service, a dollar here and there and we were treated like royalty. We tipped the maid $5 on the second and fourth day and after the first tip we got throw rugs on both sides of bed. Communication with the Dominicans was another complaint. Communicating was done in 鈥淪panglish鈥? A little English mixed with some Spanish and we had no 鈥減roblamo.鈥?br/>The food was good not great but it鈥檚 an all inclusive and it was what we expected. We always found something at the buffet. The Japanese and Gourmet restaurants were fabulous, the Steak House was fair. At the buffet try a little of this and that and if you don鈥檛 like it try something else. Many of the complaints were of someone or their whole party getting sick. It鈥檚 simple,鈥滵ON鈥橳 DRINK THE WATER鈥?not even at your meals or brushing your teeth.We stayed away from the water and didn鈥檛 have a problem. Does anyone want to buy any Imodium AD, because I came back with what I went down with I brought it because of all the warnings. There is no doubt in our minds that those who got sick drank water somewhere, maybe in the shower. As for the fruit I ate it three times a day and if the bug was in the fruit they would have buried me in the DR.Also no bugs in the room and the beach was beautiful. As for the complaints about the sea weed, every morning all the sea weed was all picked up as well as any of the debris from the night before remember this beach is on the Atlantic and sea weed accumulates during the day.Some complaints were about the size of the Resort; again, do your home work if you want the condensed version stay at the Dominicana which is a high rise with hallway and disco noise. The lay out of the Bavaro was great with small buildings with 8 rooms per building. The walk to the Dominicana wasn鈥檛 even 5 minutes. Don鈥檛 bother waiting for the transportation to take you there, just stroll over with your partner and enjoy the beautiful grounds and surroundings. It didn鈥檛 seem like the Resort was full but there was no problem in getting chairs in the shade at the pool or at the beach. The pool fills up between 10 and 11 am and the beach between 11 and 12 noon. Go down and put a towel on chairs you want and go have breakfast, no problamo. Not like the complainers stated that you have to sleep at the pool to get a shaded area or you have to be there at 7am or there aren鈥檛 any left. Judge for yourselves after the first morning you鈥檒l get a feeling of when you need to get to your spot each morning. The suites were just fine and large with the sunken living room area, again at the Dominicana you just get a hotel room. The suites were and kept spotless as was the entire resort, no litter or trash anywhere.HINTS鈥︹€?The sidewalks were just painted and are slippery when wet. I recommend that you stay away from high heals and bare feet.Bring large insulated cups and use them at the bars from soda, beer and frozen drinks.The liquor flows and the beer (Presidente) is just fine. Again something for them to complain about as well as the liquor not being top shelf. Drink the frozen drinks and have a great time.Bring an umbrella it rains from time to time and if you have to make a move you might just get wet, but its warm anyway. Bring plenty of US singles for tipping US change is hard to find. ($50 will do)Only buy Cuban cigars at the cigar store at the Dominicana because all the rest are Dominican with a Cuban seal on it.The souvenirs are really garbage and expensive unless you have to bring something home to some one stay away from them. The flea market at the right side of the Resort on the beach is a tuff market with them all over you until you buy something, stay away.Take the OutBack Safari it was a blast.Make sure you book your excursions at least the day before. Apple posts their hours from 6:30 to noon and 4pm to 8pm but you can鈥檛 find a representative before noon and their gone at 7:45pm.Don鈥檛 listen to the complainers they wouldn鈥檛 be happy if the vacation was free, this is a beautiful resort, the people and accommodations are great the food is good and we recommend that you book it and have a great time.

<Content>Had a Blast My husband and I just got back from our 4 night 5 day stay at the Iberostar Bavaro 鈥?Punta Cana. We had a wonderful time! The resort is beautiful and the beaches are fantastic. I will definitely say that we are very picky travelers but really enjoyed our stay here. Here are some specifics.Travel: We flew USA3000 direct from Baltimore. Both coming and going the flights were fantastic. We had smooth flights both times. I would definitely suggest going direct if you can鈥?I can鈥檛 imagine having to deplane in the first US city you come into from DR and go through customs only to reboard the same plane to fly somewhere else.Check 鈥揑n/Out: although I had emailed the hotel twice asked in both English and Spanish for a room close to the beach my request was NOT honored. I was surprised as I had heard that an email usually works鈥?however we were surprisingly pleased with our rooms location which was extremely close to the lobby area. The staff was very pleasant, spoke perfect English, and helpful. Check out was a breeze!Room: Were nice, big, and clean. We did get the second floor as we requested. The rooms probably could use a little 鈥渇reshening鈥?up as they looked like the bedding and upholstery had been there for a while but they were perfectly acceptable. The mattress however was way too soft for our liking. We like it extremely cold and honestly never had a problem keeping our room as cool as we desired鈥?the ceiling fans definitely helped. Our maid was great and restocked our fridge everyday. Our only problem was that our first safe jammed with our stuff inside but they came and eventually (they had to take it, with me along side, to their welding shop to bang it open) opened it and replaced it with a new one. I was surprised at how quickly this happened as we were forewarned by the hotel staff that DR time is slow鈥? But they got their within 10 minutes and were working on it non-stop until they opened it up鈥?about 2 hours in total.Resort/Beach/Pool: The Resort is lovely. The grounds are very nice and there are peacocks and flamingo鈥檚 everywhere. They have some lovely gardens and some out of the way nooks to sit and read/talk that were very pretty. We basically stayed at the beach/pool all day. This was our first vacation since we had kids so we pretty much relaxed all day long. We got to the beach around 11 and if we had wanted could have easily found chairs under the huts鈥?we would have had to share with another couple on the opposite end but who cares鈥?as it was we are sun lovers and didn鈥檛 care. The beach is breathtaking and the sand is softer than cotton. The water was a nice green although you could not see through it鈥?probably because it was still Atlantic Ocean and not Caribbean Sea water. The pool was also very big and nice but much more crowded than the beach seemed to be鈥?we鈥檙e beach people anyway so it wasn鈥檛 a problem. Also a very short walk to the bar, ice-cream hut, and food.Food: This is the one area that I was thoroughly disappointed. There was definitely plenty of food, there was a huge variety, we could always find something we recognized and something we ate on the buffets鈥?the problem鈥?. it was all BLAND BLAND BLAND. Like I said we certainly didn鈥檛 starve, there was always food that we could eat and I am definitely NOT a picky eater but I found even the 鈥渓ocal鈥?dishes were very bland and without much flavor. I was surprised given we were in the Caribbean but then realizing that this resort caters mostly to English, Dutch, Germans, etc鈥? who鈥檚 food is also very bland I understood what was going on. If there was a reason why I might not come back to Iberostar its because the food was just too bland. (By the way we took a consensus of the many couples we met and pretty much everyone agreed that although there was plenty of food, and everything was fresh, everything was pretty bland) Breakfast was definitely best as it had a good mix of European food and American food. The only specialty restaurant that we tried was the steak house and again we were unimpressed. The cut of meat wasn鈥檛 that great and the steak was definitely not flavorful. We didn鈥檛 try the other restaurants as they were primarily seafood based or we didn鈥檛 hear good things about it and my husband is a picky eater so we stuck to the buffet since we knew there was always something my husband would eat there (they grilled chicken, steak, and pork at every dinner). The best thing I ate there was the Paella that they made during the beach party鈥? That was yummy and full of flavor but everything else wasn鈥檛 great.Staff: Super super friendly. Nice, polite, and friendly. Wanting to please, pleasant to talk too, and did I mention friendly?Nightlife: I was a little disappointed that things started so late in the evening but the shows from what I saw were cute. We primarily stayed in the casino at night. We met great people there and basically formed our own little blackjack table each night. Some dealers were quick and really hustled and others were slow and easy but all were pretty much all business. Friendly but not chatty and I definitely suggest that you keep count yourself as we found the dealers making mistakes often and either the player or pit boss would catch them. If you like to gamble, and we do, this is a very very small casino. 2 roulette tables, 4 blackjack tables, 1 3-card poker table and around 15ish slot machines, non of them video-poker. We were disappointed at first but like I said we made good friends with some of the guests and ended up having a fantastic time鈥?and with the limit being only $5 per hand we pushed around money all evening and were even when we left.All in all it was a GREAT trip! I鈥檓 not sure if I鈥檇 go back to Iberostar again as I heard that the food at Secrets was much better by three different couples who stayed at both resorts and I think I would want to try that first. I would definitely go back to DR.

<Content>Loved Iberostar Punta Cana!!!!!!!! Awesome time..... Do not listen to the BAD reviews. Go with an open mind and do not be so Judgemental and picky. Enjoy everything for what it is worth!!!! I went with my husband and two girls ( ages 10 and 6). The are so friendly and were great to my girls!!!! The grounds are beautiful and always well kept every morning. The beach is very big, the sand is SOOO soft. The Ocean was a little rough but then calmed down. The color is breathtaking. The entertainment was great. The food I thought was good and many choices to judge by. The atmosphere at the beach restaurant is just soooo relaxing. My girls had ice-cream/choc. malts everday!!!! Do be aware of the topless/tiny suits for the men if you have children. It was NOT a big deal for us or them. I enjoyed the different cultures and they are NO hang ups on body types as you would find in the U.S. You feel relaxed on who you are!!!! We had perfect weather. I can home with a nice tan!!!! if it does rain it always clears. I enjoyed the Punta can side better because it is less busier. I would advise not to take the snorkeling near the hotel, we did have fun but not much to see. Bahamas was better. Please go and enjoy the flavor of the Island!!! It was one of our best trips we will remember.

<Content>Wonderful!!!!!! My husband and I just returned yesterday. We went 10/22/04-10/29/04. Being as we have 4 small children, I don't generally have extra time to sit and write this review, but felt it was important. I read all the reviews before we left, and to be honest, was a bit afraid for our upcoming trip. BUT, it was absolutely fantastic. You will not regret this trip.Leaving our kids behind, this has been our first trip alone in about 7 yrs, SO, maybe we would have had a good time anywhere...but, I am rather picky and I have the greatest time.This resort is IMMACULATE. So clean, no bugs, always picked up, friendly people, good food(not great, but good), BEST beach, and yes, The Americans are a minority there, mainly European, so there is lots of topless women. Who cares?? If u dont like it, dont go there and stay in America. Sand felt like flour, perfect weather everyday for us, (that can change though, but we had good luck), wonderful pool, good drinks...basically it could not have been better for us. We LOVED it and will definitely return!Have Fun!!!!!!! Dont worry, be happy, or so they say!

<Content>An amazing trip My wife and I, and two friends just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro tonight (October 23rd-30th) and we had an amazing time.Thanks to this great site and all of the reviews of this hotel, we learned a lot of tips that helped make this an incredible vacation.1) Go to the Bavaro, not the Dominicana or Punta Cana. If you go to the Bavaro, the rooms are beautiful, the resort itself is nicer, and you get acceess to all three resorts.2) Ask for a second floor room near the pool. This is the best location, hands down. If your room is too close to the beach, it will be musty. If it's on the first floor, you may have a problem with bugs. I E-mailed the resort a week before leaving, and we got everything we wanted.. Including rooms right next to our friends.3) Don't expect gourmet food. Some of the specialty restaurants have very good food, but overall the food was good but not great. The buffets are the same everyday, which the group I was with had no problem with.4) Get your spot on the beach EARLY. We ended up setting our alarm for 7am, putting towels out on the chairs we wanted, then going back to bed. :) Unfortunately this is the only way you're going to get a good shady spot on the beach. Beautiful beach and pools though.5) Speaking of alarms, bring your own clock. They don't have them there and if you want to tell the time in your room, you will need one.6) There is sometimes a language barrier. At first it was difficult trying to communicate with the general workers there. However, over the week, we would continually try to speak Spanish. By the end, we could easily carry on simple conversations with them. This made it much easier, and they certainly appreciate it.7) Bring lots of small bills for tipping. The workers at the resort work tirelessly and they do a spectacular job. If you've gotten great service at a restaurant, maid service, etc, tips are greatly appreciated.8) Excursions. We chose not to fill our week with excursions because there was so many things to do at the resort. However, we did end up going on the 'Aquatic tour', in which you get to drive around the ocean in 2-man speedboats, then go snorkelling through a reef. We had a great time doing this... Well worth it.Overall a very memorable trip. I would not hesitate for a seccond to recommend the Bavaro.

<Content>Go prepared with lots of Imodium! Well, the resort itself is quite nice, the pool beautiful and the beach breathtaking. The rooms are a bit battered and my husband and I were disappointed at first but we became oblivious to their worn states and instead concentrated on keeping the very large crack under our door covered with a towel so as to keep critters out! The service at the bars and restaurants was quite good. 99% of the personnel working there are wonderful. The pool bar was a little slow but improved as the week went on. The guys at the lobby bar are absolutely the best! The entertainment was pretty decent most nights. Where they get their energy is beyond me and boy can they dance! The drinks were quite tasty and the food very good. HOWEVER, something will most definitely clean out your system! One of the five of us traveling got violently ill (severe abdominal cramps, severe vomiting and severe diarrhea) and lost two days out of his seven there. The rest of us got hit with the latter in varying stages. After a couple of days we were afraid to eat or drink too much since we didn't know what was causing it but by mid week, we figured what the heck. Even with all the Imodium in the world, we were still spending decent amounts of time sitting down! As a result, we figured we may as well eat and drink what we wanted as it couldn't get any worse! Take your complaint to the front desk (Guest Services). You can get a good laugh when they tell you not one single soul complained out being ill while there! 99% of the other guests we talked to also spent quite a bit of their time sitting down too! At least toilet paper is plentiful!All in all, it is a great place to get one heck of a tan! And there are bathrooms pretty much everywhere so if you do decide to go and eat, drink, and be merry, you won't have too far to go to get a seat!Be prepared to have one of your party get up quite early to go to the pool to place towels on lounge chairs to save them because they seem to go pretty quick if you don't and if you get there after 9am, you better be prepared to get the leftovers. There are beautiful birds everywhere. Be careful feeding them though around the pool area because if you do, be prepared for immediate droppings....and these are rather large birds, if you get my drift! Seems to be an epidemic with all inhabitants! All in all, I can't really say if I'd go back or not. Personally, my hubby and I prefer Cancun, and our visit there in February to the Riu Cancun and Riu Las Americanas blew this place away in quality although they are considerably smaller resorts.

<Content>Iberostar Dominicana, don't go there Just got back (12 Oct) from the Iberostar Dominicana, Bavaro. We were assured by the travel agent (First Resort) that this hotel was a 5* Prestige hotel (Airtours rating) well, it might well have been, once. Now at best its a 3* with porters. The location, next to a beautiful beach and the gardens and swimming pool are all great. But the rooms are tired and jadded (like me when I got home) The food is absolutely pants, my wife actually lost weight (and she aint fat) on an all inclusive holiday, that can't be right can it? We've been to the Dom Rep before so we knew what to expect, but last time we stayed in a Riu hotel which was superb compared to this place. I know I sound like a moanie old git, and I don't normally make a fuss but this was so bad I just had to say something. Take my advice, go to the Riu next door and be treated like royalty for a couple of weeks. Good luck.

<Content>Iberostar Punta Cana Trip I went to Punta Cana just last week and stayed for five days at the Iberostar Punta Cana...The Iberostar Punta Cana was extremely nice, clean and the staff were nice  friendly...So dont believe what others may say about the Iberostar Punta Cana...I ve seen the Barvero which is right next door and its a ghetto compared to the Iberostar Punta Cana...The Iberostar Punta Cana, Dominican, and Barvero are all together so you have access all three's anmenties in all three resorts...The grounds are immaculate...The beach and ocean is clean and nice...The food and bars were good..I was impressed with the Iberostar since this is my first time at their resort but will definitely go again...(Hopefully next summer)... Only recommendations I can give is stay away from the gift shop in the Barvero, they are shady and will try to lie about the dail US currency to pesos for extra cash...just stop by the hotel lobby desk, they have it posted daily what the exchange rate is...You can ususally get most of your gifts in the regulated gift shop in the Iberostar Punta Cana/Dominican hotels...There is also down the beach (and its a hike of a walk too, but scenic) a string of shack huts of gift shops that you can go and haggle for gifts...They have more of a selection than the gift shop but carry alot of the same things as well...Remember to tip the staff especially the maid well, they make very little money and do a great job...

<Content>Ok My trip in Iberostar Dominicana was from august 29-7 of september. The people were very polite but the hotel in itself was not the greatest to be a Five star hotel. Actually they say its a five star because it has four facilites and the one thats the actually five star is Iberostar Bavaro . The foods are also not the greatest because mostly every night is the same food.

<Content>3 out of 5 ill-Not handicap friendly Brother's and sisters travel together every year. We were going to Grand Bahamas but had to pick a different location at the last minute because of the hurricanes. This site was one of the things that helped us choose. The bus they put us on to get to the hotel had NO A/C. It wasn't until almost everyone on the bus started complaining, that the Apple Rep. finally opened the vent and a window up front to let in some air. Although they do say there are no handicap rooms, they do not tell you that the resort itself is not very handicap accessible. There are steps to get into and out of restuarts and into every room.We requested a ground floor room but there was still one step going up to the enterance way. They did bring us a ramp so that my sister could drive her electric cart to the room. The resort itself was very pretty and well cared for. The pools were clean and plenty of activites were offered. The beach was very nice. Difficult to communicate with the average worker there if you do not know Spanish. Employees that were in charge of activites, did know several different languages. All employees very friendly and good service in all areas. There were alot of different places to eat to choose from BUT all their beef had the same strange flavor to it, fruit was not ripe, milk and yogurt served at room temp. By the 3rd day, my brother was ill, and by the 4th day, my other brother and I were very ill and spent the rest of the trip in our rooms. It's five days since I first got sick down there, I did make it home and am hoping to be able to return to work tomorrow. My suggestion would be to stay closer to home...We'll be in the Bahama's next year.

<Content>Great time Just got back from Punta Cana (10/7/04), VERY RELAXED, the resort area and accomodations were great, the food was above average, the buffet was very good, speciality restaurants may have a single item menu, however you can ask for something else. lobsters(Caribbean) is the only thing served in the Gourmet restaurant. Pool area and beach are beautiful and clean, great for swimming and walks. Entertainment is more Catskill, but they give it their best. Staff is very polite  helpful. Only complaint: Ameican Airlines canceled direct flights from NY, so going and coming you can expect lost time. Miami is not a great hub for making connections. Write AA to to reinstate direct flight.

<Content>Most Relaxing Family Vacation Ever August 28---Sept. 4, 2004Without a doubt this was the most relaxing vacation our family has ever taken. After dropping off our car at the airport (at 4 am!), we had little to do but relax and enjoy ourselves.The staff was fabulous---a very refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of America. We spoke very little Spanish but our paltry attempts were met with much gratitude. Although gratuities were included in the price of the vacation, we were more than happy to tip additionally because of the excellent service and pleasure with which we were served.The room is adequate. Cool enough and big enough for a family of four. No bugs, and the maid service was also excellent. They even went as far as artfully arranging our young daughters' (3 and 7) stuffed animals, which was a big surprise for them after a long day at the beach. If you are expecting an American four-star hotel you will be unhappily surprised; however, since the weather cooperated we spent little time in the room, and since there was the Disney channel our kids had little reason to complain. I was a little stressed at first that my blow dryer, curling iron, and clothes iron would not work, even with the purchase of an adapter, but I quickly got into the Dominican spirit and went wrinkled and carefree.The buffet food was unchanging. Our daughters only found about three things they liked (besides the daily ice cream), and quickly grew tired of them. I felt much the same way. My husband, however, enjoyed the food very much. The specialty restaurants varied. Forget the Caribbean one. The steak house was good, as was the Mexican restaurant. The Star Rock Cafe improved on our second visit, but the star was La Sibilia, the gourmet restaurant. We let our girls have dinner with the kids' club and had a romantic night out. The food, atmosphere, and service were the culinary hi-lite of the trip.The Kids' Club was fabulous---we cannot say enough! Our daughters went a few hours almost every day (and often begged to stay when we wanted them back), and met so many friends that even when they weren't at the club they were playing with their new buddies. All of the staff were extremely attentive to the children. My girls were treated like royalty, with their drinks constantly filled and their every wish attended to. This behavior was consistent from the entertainment staff to the man sweeping the beach. It was such a pleasure to see people treating children with such affection. At night the kids got on stage and danced, and this was my favorite part of the trip. Our kids were at the perfect age to enjoy dancing with their friends, and often the staff included them in fashion or talent shows. After the shows the staff would take them to the mini-disco, so my husband and I got to spend a portion of the night knowing that our kids were nearby and having fun, while we sipped the excellent cold drinks and enjoyed the adult entertainment, which was suitable for our daughters as well. The emcee was very impressive---he spoke 4 languages fluently.Prepare to start drinking early---the drinks really cool you down. They are, however, erratic---I think I had every version of a Miami Vice possible.The Outback Safari trip was fun. We enjoyed getting out into the real DR and seeing how the Dominicans have benefitted from the $10 tourism fee we all paid (clinics, schools, etc.). The people were very pleasant and proud of their homes---it took you beyond the reaction of pity at their poverty and made you more respectful of their culture.Two warnings; (1) You can't bring enough sunscreen. Our Irish-German-American family used four bottles, two of which we purchased for $20 a pop at the SuperMercado (and don't yell at the the clerks for their exchange of your dollars to pesos---they do the best they can!). (2) Bring enough cash. Souvenirs are available at the Caribbean Street, and other items, such as the cool floats everyone has in the pool, can also be bought there. We used $500 extra, not including the Outback Safari.All in all, the most relaxing and fun vacation for everyone in our family. We can't wait to return!

<Content>Second time around, liked it even more! I have been a travel consultant since 1959, therefore am very picky about details. This was a real vacation for my husband and myself. The first time for him at this location (a 2nd visit for me) and he loved the ambience. Although it is an all-suite hotel (590 rooms), you have the feeling that you are in your own private villa. We were there when hurricane Jeanne made a direct hit. We never lost electricity, water, airconditioning. Had gourmet food around the clock, plus entertainment and drinks til late. The service was excellent in spite of the fact that they had only 1/3 their staff. Everyone was courteous and helpful. The Hotel Manger was everywhere; the staff apologizing for not being able to change our linens, nor clean our rooms for two days!! The essentials, towels and toilet paper, were distributed in the lobby for all to take. Except for the use of the beach and the pool, we did not miss any amenity. I will put the Iberostar Bavaro at the top of my list for all-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean.

<Content>Great time had by all. We were part of a party of twenty friends and children and stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana. 9 Adults, 11 teenagers. 18th August -3rd September.In short, we all had a great time. The place is kept immaculately clean and tidy and is big enough to cater for everyone鈥檚 needs.RoomClean and tidy, air con worked, fridge was filled daily, beds comfortable, generally rooms showed a little evidence of being lived in but whilst we were there they we refurbishing rooms. But after all this is a hotel.FoodThere was always something to eat in the buffet restaurants, in fact these were better than the speciality restaurants. Give a miss to the Caribbean Restaurant. But go for the Oriental. Mexican a bit bland, starters better than main courses, Steak house, go for the fillet or spare ribsBeachExcellent, but get a sun shade early, best snorkelling in the Rui section about 500 yards up the beach towards the wreck. Beach in front of the baverio nicer and less crowded, not that the beach was overly crowded.Pool large clean and not overcrowded. EntertainmentShows in main area, bit multi-national and audience participation but better than you would get in a Mediterranean resort, (no drag acts, singing to backing tracks). We preferred the Punta Cana Reception Bar, which had generally a live band but they were only on to 10.30 ish, when we were just getting started. Star Rock Caf茅 OK, DC 10 Club OK but every night they had a dancing competition that when on to long and music very Latin based. Adult鈥檚 liked it but teenagers said 鈥渂oring鈥? Bag of chips to walk home with from the DC10 鈥?Star Rock made our day after Ron鈥檚  coke.StaffThe staff could not do enough for you, very helpful, they did not speak perfect English but with a bit of effort on your behalf you could be understood. A few words of Spanish went down great. We found the service was good and didn鈥檛 tip until the last day.Yes there were a few niggles, 1.The DC10 club did not allow under 18 teens, so we had to swap bands with our older teenagers 17  16 so that they could get in. Some nights they would allow in the younger ones 15-14 sometimes not.2.Lack of evening entertainment for younger teenagers, instead of Karaoke in Star Rock, thought that they would have had a bit of a bop.3.$10 dollars to get into the country and $20 dollars to get out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!4.$10 dollars charged per Kilo over luggage allowance to get out, somehow as a family of 4, at Gatwick we had 72 kilos, at Punta Cana airport we had 82 kilos, but less stuff in our cases, no I could not work that out!!! But let鈥檚 say the heat affected the scales.5.There is no were to go outside the resort.6.Some people were reserving beds by the pool and beach, so many of the beds would not be used for half the day.Having read a lot of the reviews by Americans of this resort, I can only say some of them need to get out of small town America and see the world, this is a tropical third world country and you do get insects, the food is not McDonald and dollars are not the local currency. Yes, European women do get there --- out on the beach and some of them shouldn鈥檛, some people even smoke!!! But this will not deprave your children and turn your menfolk into devil worshipers. If you attempted to be a bit politer, less demanding and treated the staff with some respect you may find that you get as good a service as we did without tipping.So to finalise, if you go with an open mind you will have a love it.

<Content>What A Week! WOW!!  Where can I start? Airport to hotel:From the time we arrived at the airport everything ran smoothly. The apple vacations people were waiting for us, transferred us to the hotel within 45 minutes from the plane landing. Hotel:When we arrived at the hotel the grounds were immaculate. Our rooms were not ready only because check-in was not until 3:00pm. They registered us, served us welcome drinks before we even finished registering, and we had the run of the house until our rooms were ready. Which by the way were ready when we went back to the desk at 2:30pm after having a wonderful buffet lunch.Rooms:The rooms were bungalow style, Clean, air-conditioned, well maintained, with a Deck overlooking a beautiful garden, close to the beach and pool.The staff:Incredible, from the registration desk to the grounds keepers, they were very friendly always saying hola; no matter many times they saw you in the day. Many are fluent in many languages. The Star Friends were amazing, always looking to make sure you were having fun. Getting you involved in all different types of activities. Say hola! To Miguel, Yanet, and Ana Banana. Security was incredible every night when we arrived to our room after the nightly show there was a guard stationed in the walkway until daylight.Food:Well, let me say 11 restaurants besides all the Buffet areas. Amazing foods, anything and everything you want. When this place says all Inclusive believe it! The only time you will need cash is if you decide to leave an extra tip at the restaurants and if your buying souvenirs or if you like to smoke Cigars!If you have kids it鈥檚 a wonderful place for kids. My 5 year old had had a wonderful time. They offer Baby-sitting! At an extra charge just talk to the ladies next to the registration desk where you make you dinner reservation and they will assist you! My daughter asked if we could go back the following week. They offer day Camp also for your kids to enjoy themselves doing different type of activities. At 8:00pm they had a show for the children every night in which the children participated.Go and enjoy yourself! The hotel and grounds are exactly how they are pictured in their brochures.

<Content>A great week We (family of 4 - 2 adults 2 kids) stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro for a week at the end of August and had a great time. (The Bavaro was the nicest of the Bavaro, Dominicana and Punta Cana). The beach, pool and rooms were all very nice - the only complaint that my kids had was that they wished there was a slide in the pool (we had previously gone to Atlantis which is known for its great water slides - but we paid almost twice the price in Atlantis).Beach: follow everyone's advice and reserve chairs early. Snorkling, banana boats and kayaks were all fun. We also did a speedboat excursion that was fun (drive speedboat and snorkel ) Walk to the shops on the beach and pay a lot less than the price that they originally tell you. Pool: The pool was very nice and clean. We all enjoyed the swim up bar. Rooms: Nice - big enough for a vacation where you don't plan to spend alot of time in the room. The small couches made nice beds for our kids. (1 fit kids under 12 I'd guess and the other was a bit smaller ) Call or email ahead of time and ask for a room near the beach/ pool if that is what you want. Some rooms are very far from everything. A/C worked fine, a couple tiny bugs and slight musty smell, but we were right on the beach, what do you expect? - not a problem.Food: Very good! Very convenient buffet right near the pool all day. Dinner buffets had a nice variety of food. Gourmet restaurant was excellent. Steakhouse - steaks were very good, but ribs were different than what we're used to. Japanese- food was good, but if you want sushi there is everything but sushi there - we were disappointed in that sense. Make some dinner reservations when you arrive, and check back to see if there are other cancellations. Pack immodium/ Pepto/ tums just in case...everyone's stomach reacts differently.Shows: not professional, but they were entertainingActivities: get involved with some - either at the pool or on the beach. Overall, this was a very nice family all-inclusive vacation and we would definitely recommend it!

<Content>We really enjoyed our stay at the Iberostar Bavaro We are a family of four - 2 adults and 2 boys - 11 and 14 and vacationed in Punta Cana from August 11-18, 2004. We stayed at the Bavaro which seemed to be the nicest. We were originally placed in a room by the stage and the double beds were very small more like twin beds. I had the room changed to a more quiet location and had the two double beds changed to a queen for my husband and I. I would suggest asking your travel agent to arrange this ahead of time so it isn't a hassel for your vacation. I asked some of the people who arrived when we did and it seem as though if you didn't request ahead of time where you wanted to be located you were put in the back or the least desirable location. The room was very nice, they make the two couches beds for the kids which were small, but they got use to it. The beach was very nice, they had a problem with seaweed, but you could find places where it wasn't bad. It seemed like the seaweed was around the coral reefs which was great snorkeling right off the beach!! You didn't have to swim out far at all to see beautiful fish. We have been snorkeling in Couzumel, Mexico which is known for snorkeling and I saw many more beautiful ones in Punta Cana without having to do an excursion. As far as getting an umbrella on the beach, my husband would get up early, go work out and get us an umbrella with lounges at the beach. If you went later forget getting an umbrella. I would strongly advise getting an umbrella because the beach was very hot and this really helped. We enjoyed the food, and thought the service was excellent. Part of what made the trip so nice was the star friends. My older son turned 14 while we were there so my husband told Anna Bannana, one of the star friends and they called him up on stage one night and wished him a happy birthday, gave him a t-shirt and a diploma, which he was quite embarrassed about but will probably always remember! They really go out of their way to get you involved in having fun and all the employees work very hard. My husband tipped alot because of how hard the people work and they don't make much money. I was surprised at how nice the pool/beach bathrooms were. They were marble and wood and were cleaned constantly! There were water problems one or two days but this was fixed within a few hours. We stayed at the Iberostar in Riviera Mayo, Mexico and enjoy the resort there too. My kids thought the pool was better in Mexico, but here there was a pool bar. We like to try someplace new each time, but I would recommend either place for a nice all-inclusive vacation.

<Content>LOVED IT whoever complains about this property, they will never be happy wherever they go. We just returned from our trip August 29 - September 5, 2004, and had the best time, the staff are just wonderful, the food is just great, the landscape is beautiful and they are always maintained and taken care, the beach is clean, and you always have lounge chairs with enough towels anytime you need them. Definitely i would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good family all inclusive vacation This all inclusive family orieneted resort exceeded our expectations. The beach is beautiful, the grounds are well manicured and pretty, with peacocks and flamingos walking next to you, and the junior suites easily handle a family of four. All the accomodations have a strong mildew smell, inevitable near the beach I think. The food is nicely presented, plentiful, and suits a variety of tastes. There is a lot of salad too, but the vegetables don't have any taste - although nobody knows why. The pool is nice, but not fabulous. The entire place is kept exceptionally clean, even the pool bathrooms! The staff is very friendly, hardworking, and energetic. They work extremely long days for many days in a row without a break, yet they always seemed eager to do their job well. It is definitely nice to tip even though it is all inclusive! Throughout our 6 night vacation, several staff came over to ask us if there was anything they could do for us or anything about the resort they could explain to us. We have been to many other family oriented resports and this one was definitely a step above the others. The staff, rooms, and food were better than at Beaches Turks and Caicos, but the pools were not. They could defnitiely use some water slides for the kids. The shows at night were adequate, but not thrilling. There is a small but ok casino. There is definitely topless sunbathing because it is mostly a European crowd. Overall, a very good vacation was had by all 8 of us (4 adults and 4 kids). Two of the adults did get traveller's stomach the last day of vacation and upon return home. Bring pepto bismol!

<Content>The Getaway My wife and I joined some friends late in June for Punta Cana. I know this is a little late but this may be of some help. The Hotel:We stayed at the Bavaro (which is the best of the three hotels). Huge resort, so bring the walking shoes with you. The rooms were very nice and roomy. Fridge was always stocked with soda, water and beer. Pools were nice but it seemed to us that the pools at the other two resorts were alot better. Room service is available at no extra charge. The food was okay, nothing great but we didn't come there to eat. Funny enough the buffets were the best to eat because you received a huge variety. Whatever you do don;t expect to much concerning the food. The beaches are nice but nothing compared to Aruba where we all went the year before. Lots of activities to keep you busy including organized beach volleyball which I played hours a day. The drinks they serve you are very strong. That was probaly one of the few complaints. I am a drinker and their drinks they served made me jerk every drink. No kidding. Went to the club their and it was okay nothin special but gives you something different to do at night. Overall the resort was absolutely bueatiful and the people friendly. EXCURSIONS:Now to the best part!! If anyone needs detailed info just e-mail me with questions. MUST DO'SMaranarium: snorkle with the sharks and stingrays and drinks afterwards on the boat while listening to Marley. They will also take you to swim at this beach where the water is stunning. Sonoa Island: take a 2 hour catamaran trip to an island where you relax and enjoy the wonderful beach. Drinks included. afterwards they take you on a speedboat back where you stop about 1/4 mile out from the beach and swim. Incredibly the water only comes up to your waste. There you can take pix with huge starfish that are found all over. Jeep Safari: interesting and relaxing. drink all day while taking a tour of the DR. At the end you will stop at a secluded beach to swim. Overall the vacation was fun. But hell aint' they all. Our group probaly would not come back to the DR. For the money I would recommend ARUBA anyday. If your already booked you will have a great time!

<Content>The Iberostar Punta Cana deserves a 'D.'  My wife and I stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana from 8/14 to 8/21. The flight over was pleasant but the experience at the Punta Cana airport was not so nice. We had a direct flight from Cleveland to Punta Cana and waited over an hour to get our luggage. The ten dollar tourism fee is a complete rip-off and the custodian in the airport restroom wanted a tip for me to use the dirty restroom.After the 40 minute bus trip to the resort, we checked in and sweated through a short presentation we could barely understand (everyone speaks Spanish). Be prepared to sweat. There is no air-conditioning at the resort (at least the main common areas) and everything (the bar, restaurants, entertainment) is under a thatched roof pavillion. After finally checking in and getting our room keys, we were escorted to our room.Our room was not in the Punta Cana side of the resort but in the Bavaro side which is much much older. We of course had a ground floor room which I heard nightmares about from reading other reviews. The first thing we saw when we went to our room was a big bug crawl in the light fixture by our door. My wife hates bugs so she was already mad at me. We got in our room and all we were looking forward to was a nice cold room so we could shower and have a good nights sleep; we walk in our room and its hot as the outside temp (which at that time was about 86 degrees and humid). We checked the A/C control on the wall and it was on full blast, not making a bit of cool air. We also had two double beds which were more like twin beds which both of us wouldn't fit in especially since it was smoking hot in the room. I then checked the refrigerator in our room for a cold drink and the refrigerator didn't work and the drinks were all room temperature. My wife and I then called the check-in desk to change rooms and they said we would have to wait until the next day. We barely slept at all because it was so hot and humid that night.The next day after getting the run-around from the front desk about a new room we decided to give the man a $20.00 dollar tip to speed things up. We were in a new room within an hour in the Punta Cana side. The second room was a third floor room with a much more modern room. The A/C however, still didnt work one bit. So for the entire week (even after complaining about the A/C) we relied on two ceiling fans to cool us down. Meanwhile, we asked some other people we met there about their room and they said it was ice cold. We were not happy.The resort itself was beautiful. Very well kept and very clean. Everyday I reserved chairs by the pool by 8:30 am (most were taken by 9:00). It helped taking our own towels too. The pool was beautiful as was the beach. It seemed like the Europeans tended to be a bit rude and they let their children run around unsupervised. One day a father and his naked four year old were playing for several hours in the pool and as soon as the boy got out of the pool he started urinating all over the sidewalk area. Several other children I saw, were apparently allowed to eat and drink as much as they wanted and threw-up on the sidewalk and in the pool. That made me not want to get into the pool as much. The nightly entertainment was worse than a high school play. That even made it somewhat entertaining at times. If you go to the beach vendors, you want to pay about 1/3 of what the asking price is (sometimes even lower). Take enough cash beacause if you use an ATM it gives you peso's. (Dont exchange your money). The buffet's were okay. By the end of the week we became tired of them. The three restaurant's we went to during the week were worse than the buffets. They were a nice change of pace but the food was average at best. If you want A/C go to the Star Rock Cafe. That was the coolest place on the entire resort. My wife and I stayed in there for hours.Men need to take some slacks (long pants) as the restaurants require them. There is no iron in the room, so if you take one you have to buy an adaptor for the outlet. The room safe costs two dollars a day (I would recommend it) and be sure to get a TV remote at the check in desk. Be prepared to see some interesting sights at the pool and the beach. Topless woman at the beach (that really shouldnt be topless) and fat men with speedo's. Overall, I thought the resort was beautiful and the experience was different but I would absolutely never go back.

<Content>Awesome week We traveled to Punta Cana from August 20-27 and had a fantastc week in paradise! There were four of us on the trip.We traveled with Apple Vacations on a USA 3000 Charter. All travel was very smooth. Check in was very easy as we did not arrive at the resort until about 9:00 PM. We had a problem with the safe but it was quickly fixed. The room was as expected--it was very nice but certainly not deluxe. The bed was comfortable, the room was a little musty but seemed to air out, and we did see a few bugs, but nothing major.Our biggest disappointment was we had requested a poolside room via email, but we ended up a LONG way from the pool, beach and lobby. We were just a few buildings from the Dominicana. The walk was not too long even from as far away as we were, and as a benefit, we were closer when we went to shows or restaurants at Dominicana. We basically only used the room for sleeping and cleaning up. The People- the staff works SO HARD to keep the resort clean and make sure we have a great time. Language was a bit of a challenge, but we managed to communicate with the wait staff pretty well. We especially loved Alex at the buffet. The people work 12 straight days and then have three off. They appreciate small gifts and tips. We used a lot of ones on the trip. Restaurants- this is the slow season so we were able to go to 5 reservation restaurants instead of three. You simply go to Guest Services after 3:00 and see what they have available. We went to the Steak, Mediterranean (2x), Gourmet, and Tropical. Breakfast was great and lunch was good, especially the day they did the kabobs and paealla. The food was much better than we expected and much better than CancunBeach- The beach was awesome!!!! We put out towels each morning around 7:30 or 8:00 and were in the front row every day. The weather was very pleasant with the breeze and the shade provided by the palapas The snorkeling was fantastic. Bring your own mask and snorkel and underwater camera, take some bread and you'll be amazed at the fish on the reef inside the swim rope at the resort.Trips- The Outback Safari was great. It really gave us an appreciation for the beautiful countryside and how fortunate we are. The host family we visited has no electricity and uses a car battery to watch TV. The Marinarium allowed us to swim with sharks. We thought there woud be more snorkeling. We would give the Outback Safari 5 Stars and Marinarium 3.5 Stars. Shows- they were ok, but a couple are pretty corny. The Star Friends have such energy, during the day they are organizing activities on the beach such as volleyball or dancing, then rehearsing for the evening shows. Alcohol- could bave some higher end brands, but we're not big drinkers.Shopping- There was a shopping bazaar one night at the hotel and we took advantage of that. The flea market was fun and there are good deals to be found there, especially on rum, cigars and Larimar. Prices at the hotel are expensive so make sure you have plenty of toiletries, sun tan lotion, Pepto Bismol, Immodium, etc.Environment- The resort is BEAUTIFUL. We enjoyed watching the birds at breakfast. The grounds are immaculate and they work very hard to keep the grounds manicured.Montezumas revenge- one of our group (from the other couple) was sick for a couple of days. My wife may have it now, a couple of days after our return This is a 6 Golden Apple experience not because of the condition of the room, but because of the overall experience. We want to travel to other locations, but we certainly will consider coming back here next year!

<Content>What a great trip! My husband and I (28/30) just returned yesterday after spending 8 days in paradise. We celebrated out 5th wedding anniversary and I can't say enough about this resort. The staff was AWESOME! This resort offers something for everyone- couples, groups and families. The age range varies greatly, but this was a positive experience. We had a great time!

<Content>loved the place My family and I visited Iberostar Bavaro from August 16th. thru August 26th. The resort, the beach, the entertainment, the service and the rooms are definitely above the expectation. It is a beautiful resort with all kind of birds roaming around throughout, the beach is white powdery sand with clear water and if you know where to swim, you will not have any problems with the rocks. The shows at night are very fun and make sure that you participate in the actual shows. The service and the attitude was way above expectation, and in general we found out that all the locals are nice.The food was not the greatest, only in Japanese, Steak and the main buffett was decent.There is no name brand alcohol being served and the taste and preparation of the drinks were very inconsistant in the different bars.our number one problem was with the smoking. There is absolutely no safe place from smoke. Shows, restaurants, the beach and even in the swimming pool. We recommended to management for a non smoking section, I hope they listen because that was the only major draw back. The rooms were very nice and are well stocked. No Smell, but do have insects like flies, ants, spiders and roaches. (you are in a tropical garden, what do you expect?).Take your own snorkling gear, it is cleaner.Take plenty of suntan lotion, anything that has come from U.S. is triple the price.Take Imodium and other stomach medicine!!!Overall my kids loved the place, except cigaratte smoke.

<Content>Life is good at Bavaro First of all, disregard all the bad reviews! Those people need to get a life and find something serious to complain about. This is a wonderful place to stay. We just returned August 16,2004.Hotel: We had emailed one week before and requested a lower level and as close to the beach as possible. My wife has some physcial limitations in walking stairs and long distances. I also mentioned it was our 30th anniversary. Upon arrival I inquired about our room and was assured our request was being taken care of. Room: We were in the first row just behind the pool on lower level and with a king bed. They more than met our request. The bungalow's are nestled in a beautiful setting. Rooms were clean and fine with no bug problems for us. I thought it was great that the air went off when the sliding glass door was left open. I could have used that feature with my kids at home !Food: Something for everyone on the buffets. Yes it is buffet food, but well above your average buffet.We were able to eat in the speciality restaurants 6 out of the 7 nights we were there. Just a little effort of checking at 3PM for any openings left at the restauants. We were also treated to an invitation only candlelite romantic dinner and special menu at the Le Ballena one evening which was outstanding. (someone had to write down from our email it was our 30th). We would highly recommend the La Bella, the Japanese, Mediteranean, and the La Marimba. The only one that was very average was the steak house. If you don't want to walk to other resorts just go to the front of the lobby and they have golf carts, and will take you.Beach: Go early in morning (8am) and claim chairs under huts or you will be left out. Just put towel or book on it and come back. The beach is fine, not fantastic blue water but still wonderful to walk and swim. Try the 2 person paddle boats down the beach. They rent for $20 for an hour. It was easy and great fun to get further out in the water.Shows: Are the singers and dancers heading to Las Vegas soon?, not likely. Would you like to sit outside sipping your favorite drink under the stars and be entertained for an evening, then by all means go. We went to every show and enjoyed them all !Trips: We did the outback safaria which did allow us to see the country and people as they really live. A good outing, but kids might not like it. We also went on the James Bond boats and snorkeling. The boats were fantastic to drive and snorkeling was good.People: Dominicians have got to be the friendliest and most serving people I have ever been around. Always serving you with a smile everyday, all day long. Never once did any one have an attitude problem with us. They do not expect a tip but are so grateful when you do.Overall: We will go back, so start packing!

<Content>Memories to last a lifetime! My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at this resort. We would definitely recommend it to any one who asked. The staff and local people are extremely friendly. Don't be afraid to try out what little spanish you know. They'll appreciate it. Just remember that you are in another country, with different cultures and customs... be respectful and open to new things. We actually enjoyed the buffet more than the restaurant. However, my boyfriend is extremely adventurous and will eat just about anything you put in front of him. So he really enjoyed trying all of the different dishes and exotic fruits that the buffet had to offer. He just really wanted lobster for our dinner but didn't exactly get what he expected, which was the only reason we didn't like it as much. The room was a little stuffy but to be expected on a tropical island. There were also some little, tiny, miniscule ants but I think they came from the beautiful fresh flowers that the housecleaning leaves everywhere. I have bigger ants in my kitchen so nothing to be too concerned about.We would also highly recommend the Outback Safari tour. The tourguides are hilarious and the country is beautiful! Be prepared to take this all day trip but the beach they take you to at the end is all worth it.All in all it was a great time! The beach, pool, activities, food, service, staff....were all excellent!!! I can't wait to go back! Just remember that you are in another country, with different cultures and customs... be respectful and open to new things.

<Content>Loved it!!! My family traveled to the Iberostar Bavaro over the course of July 8 - July 29 2004. We went in 3 rounds- My dad  his friends first (all in there fifties), then my boyfriend and me (in our twenties) and finally my mom, my mom's boyfriend, my sister and my sister's friend (teenagers). Punta Cana is a wonderful place for anyone any age. I highly recommend Punta Cana and the Iberostar Bavaro. Our family combined has been to Punta Cana five times.There are too many great things about this hotel to list them all. Some things that really stand out beside the basics (grounds, rooms, food, etc..) are the activites and the Dominicans. There is so much to do at this hotel there is just not enough time to do it all (archercy, pool games, dance lessons, volleyball, etc..). The Dominicans are the nicest people on the face of the earth. Make sure to visit Franklin at the pool bar and Ysidro at the beach bar! We will be returning again to the Punta Cana celebrate New Years this year.Since there too many great things and I cannot list them all I will list the bad instead. We did not encounter anything terribly bad, all of our problems were workable. The biggest thing is that the bars do not serve American brand liquors. Another problem is that the air conditioning does not stay on in your room when you're not in it (however it is not that bad). There is also little tiny bugs in the rooms. We got attacked by them in bed on night. Also make sure to but the lids back on your soda or you'll be drinking the bugs! Last problem is that the pool only stays open until 7 pm.Outside ExcursionsDeep Sea fishing was fun although we did not catch anything. My sister loved the four-wheeler excursion. We had an ok time horseback riding, at the ranch we went to (Rais) they just through us on the horse so it was a little scary, my horse just took off running. My sister went to a different ranch and was provided with through instruction. Ultimately, we all ended up with bruised butts! Friends we met went on the James Bond snorkel adventure and loved it.TipsIf you can bring any gifts for the Dominicans they greatly appreciate it. Some good gift ideas are: Childrens baseball gloves (they cost $75 there and the average Dominican only makes $180 a month), baseball hats or cards (the universal favorite team there is the Yankees), old clothing is also good to give to the maids. Learning a little spanish before you go is helpful but not necessary. There are not a lot of beach view rooms at this resort so don't expect one. I also had mysterious stomach cramps while I was there and took everything from Pepto, Tums, to Immodium and the only thing that made them go away was Coco Locos at the beach bar. ShoppingMAKE SURE to shop first or at least look at prices at the store in the hotel behind the lobby bar. We made the mistake of going to the beach huts first only to look at the hotel store and find that we got ripped off on the beach.Out of our 5 trips this hotel has been the nicest we've stayed. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions, I am changing email providers in a few days so if you can't get me at the address above email me at malibu27@comcast.net. Make sure to email me if you are thinking of a wedding at this resort.

<Content>Wonderful Time at the Iberostar Bavaro My Husband and I just returned from (Aug. 8-15) we celebrated our 20th anniversary. I had emailed the hotel earlier and requested a Ocean View Room and was told that this would not be possible. However, they would try to accommodate us at best as possible. True to their word we were steps away from the ocean and pool. We were greeted with fresh fruit, flowers and rum upon our arrival..nice touch.The Hotel was really clean, the grounds are well kept. However I did notice that the hotel will soon need to be updated a little. Nothing to make a fuss about. The crowd that stayed there are people with money and class. I noticed that 80% of the guest were European, 15% Canadian and about 5% american. so I must admit I was glad to meet people that was from the US. alot lot of topless sunbathing. ps. the rooms do not have irons.THE STAFF is the best. Words cannot describe the warmth and the friendliness that was displayed throughout the entire trip. I am convinced that it just comes naturally. I took the advice of the others who had traveled ablout tipping. You will have to tip because the service is just unbelievable. The BAR was the best place to hang out at night. The best bartenders I have ever met. Hello to Sosa and Miquel you guys are simply the best. They make the best Marquarita's.The Activities was also a lot of fun throughout the day. If you wanted peace an quiet the beach is the perfect place for you. So beautiful and serene.The Food was great in the main dining room there was always something to eat. I did the Japenese and Steak Rest. Service was great ,food was actually just ok. The Main Dining Room was very impressive.The Disco is for 25 and younger. We actually went one night and felt as though we were overaged Teenagers trying to revive our youth.I read the reviews and took school supplies for the children on the all day Monster Truck Outing, this was simply the highlight of our trip. The Children were so grateful for the little things that our children takes for granted.Overall this was a great trip, would love to visit again in the near future. There are 3 hotels in one. The Bavaro is the best of the 3. Hello to our new friends from Travel City, MI Shannon and Diana see you real soon.

<Content>Nice but wouldn't go back My husband and I just got back from Punta Cana on August 16th. We spent our first anniversary there and after reading the reviews, were a little apprehensive about this trip.ROOM: We e-mailed the Bavaro the week prior to departure to request a second floor room with a king-sized bed and a view of the ocean. That is exactly what we got. We were right by the pool, which was very convenient. We saw no bugs, it wasn't musty smelling and our air worked just fine. I think that if you request a second floor room, you won't have problems with bugs. The only problem was the water pressure was horrible the last two days there and the water was ice cold. CHECK IN: When we checked in we got our safe key (we were not charged for it) and they told us our TV remote was already in the room.FOOD: The dinner buffet was okay and the desserts were FABULOUS! I gained 11 pounds last week just from all the food and desserts I ate. I have lost seven though due to a stomach virus. The breakfast and lunch buffets are much better. We ate at the Japanese, Gourmet, Mediterranean, Steakhouse, and Tropical restaurants. The Gourmet was our favorite and the Japanese came in a close second. I started feeling crappy the day before we came home and have not felt right since (we've been home for five days). I never drank the water, even when brushing my teeth. Everyone on our flight was sick and after we came home, people told us that everyone they know get sick after vacationing in Punta Cana.RESORT: The Bavaro was beautiful, especially with all of the birds that are everywhere. There were workers constantly working on the grounds and the buildings. I thought it was nice being able to walk right over to the other two resorts. The gym was not nice because the equipment is old and it is like a sauna in there. They need to move it inside where it's air conditioned and they need to invest in better equipment. Everyone that worked at the resort was extremely friendly.BEACH: I have been to the Bahamas, Cancun, St. Lucia, (my husband has been to Jamaica) and we agreed that it is crappiest beach that we've been to. There was trash along the beach and sea weed everywhere. If you are looking for a nice beach, don't go to Punta Cana! I mean it's nicer than Myrtle Beach, North Carolina and parts of Florida, but it's not nice compared to other islands in the Caribbean. The topless people didn't bother me, besides most of them have no business being topless! If I had children, I would not take them to Punta Cana because I wouldn't want them to see topless women and gross men in speedos.EXCURSIONS: The Outback Safari was okay - I don't think it matched the hype. My husband and I did a similar excursion in St. Lucia and this one couldn't even compare. The best part of this excursion is the beautiful beach they take you to at the end. If the Iberostar was on this beach, then I would highly recommend staying there! We also went on the Maranium excursion and we liked it better than the Outback Safari. It was really cool snorkeling with sharks and stingrays and the boat ride was nice too.OVERALL: Although my husband and I don't like to go back to the same place twice, I wouldn't go back to Punta Cana anyway. I would defintely stay at another Iberostar, but I don't think that I could recommend Punta Cana in general and I think that that was the consensus from the people on our plane. We had a good time, however because of the beach and getting sick, I would recommend other places over Punta Cana. If you are going on a honeymoon, I would recommend going to St. Lucia instead - it's couples only and the Sandals resorts are nicer!

<Content>IBEROSTAR BAVARO ES NUMERO UNO!!! We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from August 7-14, 2004, and it was the best vacation we've ever had!! We are a family of four with a 15 year old son and 20 year old daughter. We traveled via Apple Tours and they took care of everything- nonstop flight (ON TIME), shuttle to hotel was efficient, everything was very organized.CHECK-IN: Smooth and easy, no wait, with a welcome drink- BANANA MAMA mmmmmmGROUNDS: ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! Everything lush, green, and beautifully manicured. Even during the middle of the day, the paths are shaded enough to make the walk comfortable. Yes, you do have to walk; it is very spread out, but never more than a few minutes. Wildlife is plentiful throughout the resort- peacocks, flamingos, lizards, etc.ROOM: The Iberostar granted our email request to have two adjacent rooms on the second floor. We thought the rooms were spacious- there was a separate sitting area and even a couch on the balcony! In one of our rooms the water pressure was terrible, but in the other it was great. Bugs were not an issue. There are no clocks in the room; if you want one, you must bring one.FOOD: Very good selection. There is something for everyone, but the quality is fair. We planned on eating at 3 a la carte restaurants, but only made it to La Ballena and the Star Rock Cafe. LA BALLENA: Fixed menu with grilled lobster as the entre. Meal was delicious, service was excellent.STAR ROCK CAFE: Disappointment. Service was poor, as was food. They also forgot our dessert. Would not recommend.BUFFETS: Breakfast: Wonderful- everything you could want: eggs cooked to order, fruit of every kind, delicious pastries, etc. (They also have a later breakfast by the pool from 10:00-12ish with a limited selection. This is very convenient for those who like to sleep a little later. Lunch: Buffet by pool was very convenient (you can go in your bathing suit), with a pretty good selection of food. The ice cream is also very good- go to La Helader铆a outside the back entrance- it is very good!! Dinner: Theme nights at the buffet, but staples every night. We prefered to go here rather than the a la carte restaurants, due to the good selection and convenience (You seat yourself and come and go when you please)BEACH: GORGEOUS!! Soft sand, beautiful ocean. Very warm, clean, clear water. Some spots had more seaweed than others, but it was always easy to find a clear area. Waves were gentle when we were there.POOL: Large and spacious. Many people brought toys and floats. Volleyball net and fountain in the center of the pool were always a hit.ACTIVITIES: Every half hour there was a different activity, sometimes more than one at the same time. There was so much to choose from, including: volleyball (pool and beach), archery, water aerobics, darts, horseshoes, bocce, team games, and many more! They even had a beer drinking contest. Also, make sure to play Bingo with EDU (He is hilarious) and you can win some prizes. Dancing lessons (merengue, salsa, and bachata) were our favorite. They also have the official Iberostar song--You will either love or hate Dale P'alla by the end of the week! We really recommend getting involved in the activities- the STAR FRIENDS are the friendliest people and really make your stay a blast! A big HOLA to our favorites: Desiree, Diny, Edu, Patricio, AnnaBanana, Samuel, Isabel, Johanna, Domingo, and our dancer friend, Diana!NIGHTLY ENTERTAINMENT:SHOWS: Very entertaining! About every other show required audience participation- one night the entire show was put on by the guests, including some of our family members! It was really fun to be able to participate and also go back stage to see how they ran the shows.Every night, there was dancing before and after the show, mostly with a live band. The Star Friends were STILL there teaching us merengue, salsa, and bachata. This was one of the highlights of the vacation, especially since our dancing improved so much by the end of the week.CASINO: Small, but bigger than we expected. We won on both the slot machines and at the black jack tables. Be careful- the dealers do not always count accurately and try to trick you!!DISCO: Not that great. We prefered the dancing before and after the shows, and by the time this was over, the disco was thinning out.SERVICE: Excellent!! The staff works very long hours- the waitress you had at breakfast will be serving you drinks at midnight. They were always smiling, and tips are very much appreciated. The impeccable cleanliness is evident everywhere you go. Even the bathroom by the pool is spotless. Everytime we went in there, the same lady was cleaning.COMMUNICATION: Very multicultural place. Guests are from all over the world, so you don't assume anyone speaks English (at least as their first language), because only about 20-25% do. All activities were explained in Spanish, English, French, and ocassionally in German. All of the people at guest services speak English, as do most of the Star Friends. Waiters and waitresses spoke minimal English. It made it easier that one of us was fluent in Spanish, but it is not absolutely necessarily to speak it. If you know any Spanish at all, they will appreciate your attempts greatly.As we said, it was the best vacation EVER!! A week later, we are still reliving the moments, and will for a long time to come! WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE IBEROSTAR!! We hope to return soon! If anyone has any questions or wants to hear more about this WONDERFUL RESORT, please feel free to email me at bellabambina42@yahoo.com- I will be more than happy to hear from you!! SHOOOOPAAAAAA, wepa wepa wepaaaaaaaa!!

<Content>very good for money and season ( 4th - 11th August 2004) spent very nice 7 nights in Iberostar PC. Everything were as expected, thanks for many reviews. Couple of notes. Weather, beach, activities, rooms, crowd were the best. The food was from good to great in buffets. Of course if you were grown up on hamburgers/hotdogs diet then you'll be having some problems, try to be more open minded and experience different tastes. Also, mix of alcogol, sugar, 90F heat and heavy food generaly lead to very bad problems with your stomach ( you can call it food poisoning). Some adjustment needed to get used to local bottled water and beer. Local vine sucks big time, but they do have pretty nice Italian champaing in Dominicana bar and Gourmet restaurant. Dont expect too much from restaurants - its just buffet's food served in different way, if you really like sushi, then please dont go to Oriental one, its so fake, the same advice for the stakehouse's fans.

<Content>IBEROSTAR NOT AS GOOD AS BARCELO We just got back from staying at The Iberostar Punta Cana Hotel. Punta Cana is one of the most tropical, affordable islands there are. With that said the beach area and our pool was outstanding. The reception at check in and the workers there are all very friendly. We had a nice 2nd floor pool view, but I guess because it was raining upon arrival, our room was musky smelling and wet like all night. Also, there were tiny little ants around the sink in the bathroom every morning. We cranked up the ac and the room dried out and turned out fine then. The buffets were ok, always managed to find something I liked there. The two gourmet resturants we ate in were absoulutely terrible. The steaks were so tough we couldn''t eat them and in the seafood resturant, the food tasted like soap like they didn't clean out the dishes good enough. Of course it was very hot which I enjoyed very much while at the pool and beach, but when you get dressed up at night to go eat, these two resturants had no ac and you were hot... our other complaints were no pool bar, and there are no blended drinks. all their mixes are in big slushy like machines which became warm and watery by the time they poured the warm rum in them and you walked back to the beach. We stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace 4 years ago and only wished we stayed there again, no comparrison. I guess you get what you pay for.

<Content>Great time with friends at Iberostar I just returned from one week at the Iberostar Bavaro resort. I found the reviews here helpful before I went, so I though I would add my two cents about our trip in case it helps anyone else! We went there on a group vacation with friends. Our age ranges were 26-30. There were 11 of us, some single, but mostly couples. We booked through Apple Vacations, and they made everything easy throughout the trip. The flight on USA 3000 was fantastic. There was an in-flight movie, meal, and money game. The apple rep we met at the airport directed us to our bus, which could have been a bit cooler, but overall was fine. Our checkin at the resort was smooth and complete with a welcome drink (Bananamama). Since we booked through Apple Vacations, the safe was free, and we got our key with our room packets. The tv remote was in the room, although per other reviews here, we did ask for it upon checkin. We were told it was already in the room. Rooms: They were nice and spacious. Ours was a first floor room. The shower had great water pressure, and it was very clean. The only complaint I have is that we saw several tiny ants in our bathroom and on our nighttable. They didn't hurt anything, but we did notice them. I don't think it was a cleanliness issue, but rather a tropical climate=bugs issue. The bed was very comfortable, and the maid was very nice. We left $2 on our bed each day for her, and we always had a stocked minibar and sometimes fresh flowers in the bathroom. The tx got most major channels, including ESPN and some movie channels, which was nice as we got ready in the morning or evening.Food: We thought the food was absolutely excellent. Out of 11 people, only one of us had gastrointestinal issues. We ate at 5 of the specialty restaurants (we were only supposed to get 3, but it wasn't hard getting more). Japanese, Gourmet and Mexican were great. The steakhouse and tropical were good, but not as fantastic as the others. Also, those two were outdoor restaurants so very hot. Even the indoor restaurants were not super cool, but we didn't have a problem with that. The buffet was great....lots of choices. Service was fine. Everyone in the DR moves a little more slowly than we do here in the USA, so try to keep in mind that you are on vacation, relaxed. Go with it. :-) Alcohol: If we had one major complaint about the vacation, it was the alcohol. Not name brands and sometimes not so great, but with 11 partyers, it didn't really stop us. You can get Corona in the Mexican restaurant, and the vodka and orange drink isn't bad (tastes like Tang). Out of the two beers, El Presidente and Bohemia Especial, most of us preferred the Bohemia Especial. If we had a suggestion to make (and we did on our Apple surveys), it would be more people walking around serving us drinks. We had to go to the bar and get our own drinks at the casino and pool. I had expected, especially at the casino, to have people bringing me drinks. Not a huge deal, but it would have been a nice touch.Nightlife: Not crazy at all, but we had fun. There is a dance club, sports/karaoke bar, and a tiny casino. We had fun in all three. They are all located at the Iberostar Dominicana. Most of the nightlife is there. The other bars at the resort close at 1:00 am, but the one in the danceclub is open until 3:00 am. The one in the casino until 4:00 am. There is a cigar shop open until midnight with some great cigars. There is a man who will show you how he rolls them and let you get pictures with him. They sold Cuban cigars and Dominican ones. We tried both, and though we liked the Cubans better, the Dominican ones were good too. Good enough to bring 15 or so back home! We really enjoyed the giant chess game, beach volleyball, beer drinking contest, and the pool and beach. I personally also enjoyed haggling at the beach market, which is not on the resort, but just a short walk down the beach. The national stone there is called Larimar, and it is a beautiful bluish green stone. If you can haggle, get it at the market. I got a necklace and earrings there for $20/set. A friend paid lots more in the jewelry store at the resort. Granted, hers came with a lovely chain and most likely a better setting, but I got lots more stones for way less money. We didn't visit the gym or spa or take an excursions. If you can't have a relaxing and enjoyable vacation here, you can't have one at all. It really was great. Hope this helped someone!

<Content>FANTASTIC VACATION Just returned from 8 days and 7 nights of a beautiful vacation. I would like to tell you everything about the resort and but to rest any negative reviews. We arrived at the airport and two people take your picture so when you leave you can buy it. The bus trip to the hotel was only twenty minutes on an air conditioned bus. When we arrived we were greeted by Fabio at the front desk. He spoke American and was very nice. He explained were and what was going on. Remember to ask for a remote for the television and also get the room safe. It is a charge of only 2 USD a day. this way there is no worry. We had a room on the second floor over looking the beach. Beautiful room and the a/c was working fantastic. The room was clean and there was flowers on the bed and towels in shapes of animals. The terrace was a nice size and was nice to sit outside. Never a bug or ants as others tell you. THe buffets for breakfast and lunch were okay. for dinner we went to the specialty places every night. When you get to the hotel make reservations quickly and ther will be no problem. The first night we ate at La Mirimba it was the festival food it was okay. Second night was the steak house on the beach. fantastic food and very nice but it is humid and hot but hey enjoy. Third night it was the hard rock restuarant. great food and fantastic service plus it was air conditioned. Very nice and yet very empty. Next night was the Japanesse resturant. again fantastic and cold inside which was gereat. Always asking you if you are happy. The next night was mexican and that was even better then the rest. Every single resturant was great. The Casino was a room and not much goes on so it is a take it or leave it. The shows were good and the Star friends are always there to make you happy. From 10 in the morning till 12 midnight.One suggestion that everyone does is leave two dollars with a note for the maid. Trust me it goes a very long way. The mini refrigerator was stocked to the limit and she even put sodas on the side. She always had flowers and extra towels for us. All in all Iberostar Punta Cana was super and ther was no complaint except I did not want to leave. Oh yes bring suntan location. It is extrmly expensive in the gift shop. There is a flea market about five minutes on the beach towards the right. remember go ther and bargin. you end up paying half of what they asked. Do not be afraid to walk away if they want you to have it they will take your price. My wife was great at getting everything cheap. The drinks were great and not watered down as other people say. Remember enjoy and if you have a question e mail me at fh619@optonline.net and I will write back to you.

<Content>Not a bad hotel, but won't go back I just returned from the Iberostar Punta Cana.The food was not great as you can tell from the other reviews. Make sure to book as many el a carte restaurants as possible.Each day there are cancellations, so you can try to get in extra el a carte that way.The casino is a waste of money. Not many people win on the slot machines, and as another lady said, I don't believe it has any gaming legislations. If you go, set a limit of $15 a day or less.The staff are friendly. Say hi to Ricky, and call him Ricky Martin and please tell him Diana Ross said hi! (my name is Diane and he called me Diana Ross)Karoake is fun at the Domenicana, and is only on on certain days. They didn't have it last Saturday and Sunday.Make sure to barter with guys on the beach (take a right when coming out of hotel) They started at $80 for a ring, and went down to $20.Also, if you have the energy walk to the Plaza for lots of shops. About 2 1/2 miles. Take a right on beach and walk to end. Ask people where the PlaZa is, and they will tell you. It's kind of crazy at the Plaza as they are very pushy. I liked a picture, and when I came out from the shop, there were about 3 other shops holding up the same picture, and screaming lady come here! A little annoying, but humorous at the same time.Every 2nd Saturday, the market comes to the hotel lobby. We missed it when we were there.The grounds are beautiful, and you will get a lot of exercise walking from point a to b.Probably am going to stick to North American places for awhile. Many people at airport complained about the food.

<Content>Absolutely loved it!!! I just got back from a week stay at the Iberostar Punta Cana. Overall, it was absolutlely gorgeous! The Dominican people have to be one of the nicest people I have ever met. They go out of their way to make sure that you are enjoying yourself. The Star Friends were the best....expecially Noel and Szisa. The shows were hysteriical...really a good laugh! I felt that the food at the buffet was better than the food at the restaurants. There was so much to choose from that no matter how picky you are, you will find something you will enjoy. If you are going to do any trips while you are there, I hightly recommend the Isla Soana....that was awesome!!! Youe take a catamaran out to this island with a lot of music and drinking, and then when you leave the island, you take a speed boat to a natural pool, where you then get out and enjoy the beautiful water.......that was the highlight of our trip. One thing I reccommend is that you leave a tip here and there for the workers. They get paid very little, and appreciate it so much. The bartenders (Alexandro and Archangel) always knew exactly what we wanted, and served us right away. As well as the waitresses.....they always had our coffe cups filled as soon as they saw us entering the buffet. This was truly a great experience, and we will return to the Iberostar one day. Anyone who is going, have a great time, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Josephine Alvarez josephine2129@hotmail.com

<Content>EXCELLENT RESORT! You are too picky if you didn't like it!!! My husband and 2 children ages 5  6 just returned home from the Iberostar Bavaro. We spent 7 days there from July 25th through August 01st and we had the time of our lives!We've traveled extensively around the world and really enjoyed ourselves here at this resort!!! Just be opened minded, relax and enjoy!!! You can't go wrong here!We had a wonderful travel agent that gave us a lot of tips because she had visited this resort before. *CHECK IN: Our check in was completed within 5 minutes of our arrival. I went to check in while my husband waited for our bags to get off the bus. If you want to protect your valuables, make sure to get your safe key for the room at the time of check in. It just makes it easier than having to go back later. Make sure to get instructions with is as well. Also, it will cost you $2.00 a day and they will charge you at the end of your trip during check out.* DINNER RESERVATIONS: We made our reservations right after we checked in and we were able to get into 3 of the restaurants that we wanted with the times that we wanted. We did get into another restaurant for a 4th night with no problems. I met many families from the states that ate at the restaurants 5 out of the 7 nights. As long as you check back throughout your stay, they were able to reserve some of the openings. The men must wear pants in all the restaurants except the Steakhouse because that one is not air conditioned.* ROOM: We requested a room on the first floor by the pool and that is EXACTLY what we got. I was very happy about this because the resort if very large and you can be put very far from the pool. It was right next to the pool and it had an ocean view. VERY BEAUTIFUL. The room was a little smaller than I had anticipated but it was nothing to complain about. The maid service is excellent and the room was always spotless. We NEVER had any problems with bugs. But I did hear of other families who did. In your refrigerator, you are provided with all the bottled water, pop, beer you want! It's included with your room. They give you a gallon size jug of water to brush your teeth with. USE IT or you'll get sick. I rinsed my toothbrush with the tap water but then rinsed it out with the bottle water afterwards. This worked well for all of us. We always had more than enough clean towels. We did request a king size bed and got 2 doubles (more like extra large twin beds). My husband and I slept on one of them and my daughter slept on the other, my son on the couch and we all slept really well every night. The air conditioning was always perfect every day. The maid would always turn in on high everyday and when we got back to our rooms it was like an ice box so we'd turn it down to low. We never had any problems with it shutting off while we were gone.* RESORT: This resort is so absolutely, incredibly beautiful. The maintenance staff is always working on keeping it clean and kept up. They were renovating some rooms by us and they painted the exterior of our room while we were there. There are flamingos, egrets, peacocks and other wild birds all over the resort. It's amazing! This resort is very lush and very clean! I just couldn't find anything wrong with it!* STAFF: The staff works their butts off at this place to make sure everybody is happy. They always have a smile on their face and are always willing to help! I just can't say enough about them. They put on some great shows at night and they get the audience involved (but only if you want to be involved). They work extremely hard and they loved their jobs. They have activites all day long at the pool and on the beach. You just can't get bored unless you're somebody who is snobby or just plain boring! Go ahead, let loose and have fun. You won't regret it!* RESTAURANTS AND BUFFETS: The food was excellent everywhere we went. The restaurants are a step above the buffets. However the buffets were excellent as well. The food is just differenet than it is here in America, but hey guess what... you're not in America. I think even the pickiest of eaters can find something they will like. There are so many things to choose from that if you can't find something, you're the problem! My favorite restaurant was the Japanese! It was fabulous! The steakhouse was great too! The deserts everywhere were EXCELLENT! We were all thrilled with the food. Even our kids!* FITNESS CENTER: My husband worked out every morning and said it was nice. I didn't see it myself. If you go early in the morning it won't be too bad as far as heat goes. I've heard it gets hot in there because there is no air conditioning. If you want to use the hot tub, go very early in the morning or as soon as you check into the resort, make a reservation for later in the day. They get booked quickly.*POOL: The pool is very large and has a zero depth entry that is great for little ones learning how to swim. We brought pool toys with us but they had some at the resort. My kids never had to use their arm floaties because they went only as deep as they wanted. The pool could use some renovating (just repainting because the floor is peeling) but other than that it is wonderful. It can get slippery too so be careful. But it really is beautiful and wonderful for children!!! There was only 1 lady that I can remember who sunbathed topless at the pool. That was a little weird since we're not used to that. But after a day of seeing topless on the beach and at the pool, you get used to it. Of course, if you're not a snob who just can't live with that. We did put a towel on our chairs early every morning to reserve them until we got there. But most resorts are like this and it's really no big deal. We would just plop a magazine on them and then head off to breakfast, go back to our rooms to wash up and go to the pool. We got the chairs we wanted everyday!* BEACH/OCEAN: The sand is so white and the ocean so beautiful. The water is aqua blue and clear. We were able to snorkel right off the beach. We brought our own equipment. Just bring some bread and the fish come to you! We've had better snorkeling but then again, we didn't go on a snorkel trip just did it right off our beach. There are some flea markets on the beach and you can bargain, but don't be offended if they don't accept your offer. Just work through it with them, they want your money and you can negotiate anything to a fair price. We didn't buy much there; just had my daughter's hair braided and I got a Henna tattoo. It didn't last more than a week. Oh well, it was fun to do.* DRINKS: We're not big drinkers but we did have some wine and frozen drinks. They were great and if we wanted more alcohol just ask! They are more than happy to put more in! I am a huge coffee lover and I could have lived off their Espresso machine with the hot milk! I made so many iced lattes throughout the day!!! Yummy!!!!I think that's about it. All I can say is go with an open mind. Tip the staff, they so much appreciate it! They work hard so spread some of your wealth. Even if it's only a $1.00. We tipped everywhere we went, only because I believe in giving not because I wanted better. Everywhere from the front desk, maid service, entertainment staff, food service staff, you will find people that are beautiful and smiling and willing to help make your staff a wonderful one. IF YOU GO THERE WITH A BAD ATTITUDE, DON'T EXPECT GOOD SERVICE! COMMON SENSE!I highly recommend this resort to anyone with a family. The little children have a great time. Don't know if the older children would too. I hope to go back someday but will probably go somewhere else next just because we love to travel and visit new places

<Content>No Complaints either ! A wonderful time. Our family of 4 also had a wonderful time without any of the expected problems in earlier posts. No ants, no bad odors, excellent service from any and every one we asked. The people at the front desk were terrific, especially a young man named Aneudys. A wonderful smile and helpfulness made for instant friends. Although the food wasnt American, it was very good. The ribs at the Steak House were average at best, but the rest of the family who had steaks were very pleased. There is somuch food, especially at the buffet, the problem you have is that you get tired of food in general. There is a mock Hard Rock Cafe over in the Dominican resort right next to the Bavaro. It is OK, but get there before 6:30, or the wait is very long. As for the food and atmosphere of the other 2 resorts right there next to Bavaro, stay at the Bavaro. Its the nicest of the 3.We all used SPF 45 Bullfrog SunBlock and barely got any tan. Nobody got burned. I got a touch of a stomache bug... dont know how, but it didnt slow me down. Antibiotics took care of it once we got home.Topless sunbathing was a little annoying for us, but most people dress appropriately on the beach. Less than 5% of the beach lovers were indecent. It bothered me, Dad, more than my wife  daughters.We took no excursions and kinda regret that, but we enjoyed parasailing, snorkelling, pingpong, kayaking, spa treatments for the women, and some shopping. We found that if we tried speaking what Spanish we knew, it was greatly appreciated, and they seemed to enjoy hearing us stumble through it. Most everyone though speaks at least servicable English.Although we will probably not go back, it was very satisfying vacation. We found that we enjoyed vacationing in the States more than we thought !

<Content>Best Holiday Of My Life I went to Punta Cana with my mum, dad and sister and loved absoloutly everything about it. My sister and i aged 16 and 18 met people on our second day and also made friends with members of the star friends (Mac and Jaques) who were brilliant.The food at the buffet was always nice and the specialist restaurants were also fantastic. The staff throughout the hotel were very friendly at all hours especially when you left the disco at 3am and would cook food for you.The weather was gorgeous and it only rained on 2 days for about 30mins and even then it was warm enough to be in the pool or the jacuzzi.I would definately go back to an Iberostar and i loved the Dominican an dthe People there, I would recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>HAD A GREAT WEEK We are a couple in our mid 40's/ early 50's with a daughter 20 and a son 18. We are type A folkswho tend to do a lot of excursions and minglewith people. We all like to smile and kid around.My son and I are certified scuba divers; my wife and daughter are not certified but are game for the resort course. I can usually talk them into diving a couple of dives, when we go to tropical locations. My wife and I read about 100 of the 144 available reviews before we left on july 28th. It seemed as though about 1/3 of the reviews were negative so we figured there was about a 33% chance we would have have a smelly room, ants in our bed, holes in our feet from sharp beach coral, indigestion and worse, intermittent air conditioning, poor service, and the list goes on and on. We had stayed at the Iberostar Tucan several years ago and loved it. From the negative reviews, we figured the Bavaro would fall far short of the Tucan. Sometimes it's nice to be wrong.THEY BOTH ARE JUST GREAAAAAAT!The particulars: the airport is well run. the baggage is close and fast; no big, slow lines on our apple charter. 30 minute bus ride to the hotel. the staff is friendly. everyone likes a tip, but no one withholds service for a tip. Take a lot of 1's unless you want to tip in pesos (about 40 dominican pesos equals a buck). It's easy to get dollars changed to pesos at the lobby cashier. It's hard to change a 20 dollar bill into 1's. They just don't have a lot of American change. NO ONE SEEMS TO (my only small complaint). The expansive buffet is next to the lobby. 3 meals a day in 3 hour increments plus late night snacks from 11 pm to 3 am. During the day there is food by the pool. There are 4 specialy restaurantsin the evenings. Guys are supposed to wear shoes and long pants to the specialty retaurants and the buffet at dinner. We tried the steak house and the japanese restaurant. They were fine but I perferred the variety and convenience of the buffet.I also loved sitting at the tables along the railingsand watching the birds and fish.  There is a shallow moat around the buffet room with fish, ducks, geese, herons, and flamingos. The flamingos will sometimes approach the railings and allow you to throw them bread. On the grounds you will hear woodpeckers. You may see a hummingbird. There must be a couple dozen peacocks walking around. They're not friendly enough to pet, but once in a while one will walk into the food area by the pool and let you feed it a french fry or a piece of bread.The diving is very nice. The dive shop is user friendly. There is an easy wreck dive, the amstron. You can see the wreck easily from the beach. There are other close dives and several excursions to the south side of the island. 2 of them are called the Catalina Island Excursion and the Saona Island Excursion. note- people who do the discover scuba program and do a dive in the waters in front of the hotel are allowed to do the Catalina and Saona Excursions and scuba dive there too. IT'S WORTH IT. The trip makes for a long but rewarding day. Fred runs a great dive shop. Hendrik is a wiz at the discover scuba program. Tito is the divemaster/instructor/ guide on the excursions. He is a pleasure to know. They all are. My family and i made the Catalina Excursion and had fun. If a 40 minute boat ride makes you queazy, get a patch before you fly down. My wife gets seasick easily. She got a perscription for the patch and put one on before we did the excursion. That day the boat ride was kind of rough and she was fine. The people who run the shows and activities are called star friends. Let them get you involved. It is worth it. My kids got involved 1st. They did the activities and made a lot of friends from the USA and other countries. This is an international resort and only about half the guests are American. The rest are primarilyl from the U.K., the Dutch Countries, Germany, and France. Many of the guests tend to be reserved and stay to themselves, but it's hard to stay reserved when you're doing activities together. WE ALL HAD A BLAST. The kids were hugging new friends from Texas, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands when we left. I had great conversations with folks from Germany, France, Israel, and the Netherlands because of my diving and because I let myself get dragged into a show and activities. International conversations tend to be a little tough (lots of short sentences and hand gestures) but they were fun and interesting too. My 18 and 20 year old could drink. The drinking age is 18. They went to the disco every night (starts about 11 p.m.). They got a lot less sleep then my wife and i did. Other notes: the rooms are beautiful with kingsize beds. The bath has a tub, shower, toilet, bidet, large mirror, and sink. The bed overlooks the sunken living room which opens to the balcony (we were on the 2nd floor). All rooms are jr. suites in buildings of 4. There aren't many beachview buildings. The power never went out but lights were dimmer at certain times. AC's worked nice. The one in the kids room leaked but worked ok. the AC goes off if you open the patio door; comes back on as soon as you shut the door. Leave cameras on the balcony or they'll fog up for a while after you leave the room because of the temp and humidity changes. The tap water is partially purified. You use the bottle water to brush your teeth to be 100% safe. We left little gifts for the maid every day with a little note that said gracias. That way there was no mistaking what was a gift and what wasn't. We had no problems, and I didn't expect any. Our maidseemed like a real nice lady. The gift shop across the lobby has reasonable prices. It's the cheapest place to buy rum. There's lots of bargaining to be done in the shops down the beach. the Dom. Rep. is a good place to buy amber, but there is fake stuff. The test is to hold a black light (many shops have) up to the amber. The black light doesn't pass through real amber but reflects a dark, somtimes greenish hue. the light passes through the fake stuff like through plastic (which is what the fake stuff is); no reflection.the directions in the rooms that tell you how to phone the states are outdated. Check with the front desk when you call home.  Departures are efficient. Let the front desk knowat least 15 minutes before you want thebags picked up. 30 minute ride to the airport.They do open and inspect all your checked luggage at the airport, but they are nice about it. As a rule most dominicans are pretty nice folks. They also have a drug sniffing dog. If you forgot to buy a gift, the airport giftshop is very expensive. email if you have a question. I'll answer asmany as I have time to. Forgive the typos. Have a nice time! Gary and family.

<Content>Take care about wrong trip advisors I spent with my family 7 days between july 24th and july 31th. I've got two rooms on ground with a beautiful view to the sea in first line, some people wrote that this was imposible, because they are only for europeans, but not for americans or south americans. I've got towels always during the whole day, some people wrote that this was imposible.I've got good place to take sun under umbrellas, you must to reserve them early before 9 am, but it is posible.Buffet is not the best but better than the reports said, I can taste a very good paella with lobsters, tailand's meal, delicius breakfast, fresh steak prepared at the moment like filet mignon, I don麓t like the fruit except pineapple, they are not so good like my country are. Fish and pastas are not good. Ice creams are delicius, specially pistaccio with syrup of flower of passion.The reserves of specials restaurants are very easy, you have to do as soon as you arrive, if you stay 7 days you can reserve 3 times only. Drinks on the beach are not so good like the bar from the lobby are, this is the only good one.The last day my mother in law fainted and the medical service was excellent, in a few minutes they came and carry her to the hospital in an ambulance, she was near to have a diabetic coma.People are very nice always singing and dancing with a smile in face, trying all the time to help you in any way.I used tennis courts every day, you must reserve it since 8 am to the next day.I've enjoyed with my family every day and when I could I will return here. It is very remendable

<Content>AWESOME vacation!!! This past Easter, I traveled in a group of 9 people to the Iberostar Bavaro for the second time. The resort and staff were both fantastic! The check in was quick and efficient. You have to wait until 3pm to get into your room, so we brought our bathing suits in our carry-on and changed in the bathrooms so we didnt waste part of the first day. Our rooms were always very clean and the maid would come pretty early every day to clean the rooms. We didnt find not one ant in any of our rooms the entire time. The food was good. For a 1 week stay, you are able to choose 3 specialty restaurants. We ate at the Japanese, which was very good, the steakhouse which was also very nice, and the gourmet, which had a set menu containing 5 courses. The rest of the nights we ate at the buffet which always had a nice selection of food. If you cant find something you like here, I highly suggest you stay home because you are way to picky. On a few of the afternoons by the pool/beach, the staff would have little parties. One day was the paella at the beach party in a huge skillet. I was adventurous and tried it and it was very good. There is also music and dancing on the beach, dont miss it, it was a blast! Another day around the pool they cooked thousands of lobsters in these huge grilling pits-they were to die for! Many people were taking 2-3 lobsters! The grounds and landscaping were gorgeous. There were peacocks, flamingos, birds, etc. freely roaming the resort grounds. Everything was well kept and the maintinance crew were always working hard to keep everything this way. The beach was incredible. The sand was soft and white, the water was clear and warm, and there was always a nice breeze. There are chairs by the beach with huts to sit under, but we had to go down early in the morning to reserve seats each day, but this was not a big deal. The pool was also great and always warm! We reserved the same seats by the pool every day. In the one part of the pool there is a swim-up bar. Each night they have a show at the lobby. The people who put on the nightly entertainment are the same staff you see throughout the day. They work incredibly hard in order to make our stay here fun, so I really dont understand how people can complain-this is not Las Vegas, so just have a good time! The disco was located in the Dominicana, and I went every night. There was a mix of young and older people here. It is open from 11pm-3am, but usually starts clearing out around 1-1:30am. You have to have the adult wristband to get in. They play some american music along with some dominican music- on a few of the nights the activity staff held a merengue contest which was fun to watch. The casino is also in the Dominicana right across from the Dicso. Its pretty small, but serves the purpose- again- this is not Las Vegas. The staff, no matter who it was(maids,bartenders,maintenence crew, activity staff, guest services, etc) were always trying to make your stay at the resort better. They always had a smile on their face. Many people were complaining about the language barrier-the amount of spanish I know is very minimal and i didnt seem to have any problem. The staff were always overjoyed to see you attempt to speak their language. The staff works 11 days straight, from 9am-1am and then get 3 days off, and are wayy under paid, so they really appreciate tips. I cant find one thing to complain about from our entire vacation-we all had such a great time. I'm already looking forward to returning for a 3rd time this Easter. If you have any questions please email me and i would love to answer any questions. Go with an open mind and have a great time!

<Content>Dream vacation My family stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro from July 19 to July 26, 2004. My 12 year old grandson, 33 year old son and I thought that the Iberostar Bavaro was our DREAM VACATION. All of the positive things that we had read about were so true!! Wonderfully friendly people, beautiful landscaping, variety of food and drinks, lots of activities to do or not do!! All three of us kept saying that this was PARADISE!!We did not experience even one of the negative things that we had read about. Ants?? (We didn't see any) We did see plenty of beautiful peacocks, flamingoes, other pretty birds!Speedboats with motorboat exhaust on the beach?? (Saw a few boats, did not smell any exhaust) Saw beautiful blue-green water and white, powdery sand!  Food?? (Different but great variety. Could always find something that we liked. Fresh fruit was fantastic!)We had trouble with our safe, called the front desk and within 5 minutes someone was there to help us!We recognize that we were in a Caribbean country and expected things to be different than they would be in the US. Different they were, but wonderful :) We do not speak any Spanish yet we did not experience any trouble communicating with the fantastically friendly staff. We had fun trying to learn some basic Spanish.I cut my foot and it was bleeding profusely. I went to the front desk and asked for a bandaid. When the lady working did not understand what I had asked for I showed her my foot and she immediately said Curita and gave me several bandaids. I later purchased 50 curitas at the supermercado in the lobby for about $2.00!!Some of the highlights of our trip: Beach bartender, Ysidro, was fantastic!! But so were so many others! I wish that I had all of their names!!My grandson found the milkshakes at the lobby bar and chips at the beach bar were the best!! He can sometimes be a finicky eater, but he tried many different things at the buffets - and enjoyed the variety immensely!!We spent most of our time relaxing on the beach. That is why we went to Punta Cana!! We did several beach type activities - snorkeling, parasailing, banana boats, horseback riding and swimming with the dolphins. All were great, but we liked the Monster Truck Safara the best :)We all agreed that was well worth spending the day. Joselito was our terrific guide!! We took $150 in 1's and 5's bills to tip, but did not see any difference in service. It was always GREAT whether we tipped or not! But they sure seem to appreciate a tip once in a while.We also took lots of Dominican Republic baseball player cards, candy and other dollar store purchases to give to the staff and the children that we saw on the Safari. Again, very much appreciated!!Also, we took insulated covered mugs to keep drinks (water, pop, beer or whatever) colder for a longer time. Worked great!We used US Airways Vacations to book this trip online and everything went without a hitch!We are Disney Vacation Club members and have stayed at many first class destinations. For an all-inclusive relaxing resort on the beach, the Iberostar Bavaro is at the top of our list!!I can't understand how people would complain about some of the trivial items!! My guess is that you just can't please these people :(We are planning a future trip to the Iberostar Bavaro with the rest of the family for next summer!We can't wait to go back to PARADISE :)

<Content>Can't wait to go back a third time! My husband and I stayed at the Bavaro from July 11 thru July 18. This was our second trip to the Bavaro, the first being the same week of July '01. We enjoyed this trip even more than the first. This time, we knew what to expect (you're not in Kansas anymore was my mantra), and loved it. First of all, I'd like to say hi to George and Denise (a newly-wed couple from AuroraIL). We look forward to getting together with you soon! We'd asked in advance if we could be close to the pool and have a king-sized bed but when we arrived they had a room booked for us next to the breakfast buffet, which is quite a walk to anything except breakfast. To top it off, they gave us twin beds. I explained to the reservationist in my best spanish hand gestures that we were celebrating our 20th anniversary and that we were return guests. Well, the red carpet came rolling out. First of all, they moved us immediately to a suite close to the pool, with a king-sized bed. Then, each afternoon, when we returned from a HARD day relaxing in the tropical sun we would find a tray of fresh fruit and a bottle of rum in our wonderfully clean room (I left a U.S. dollar bill and 2 sample bottles of perfume for our maid each day). Yes, communication is a problem, but hey, you are at a beautiful resort, get over it! We also received 2 IBEROSTAR teeshirts to take home and were invited to a cocktail party on Tuesday night for all return guests. We took the Monster truck tour (say hi to Joselito for us!) and had a blast. Take hard candy to pass out to the children in the country. They love it. Anyway, don't be chicken, rent a sailboat and take it out, it's easy, promise! You will love it. Don't forget the sunscreen, wow what a hot sun! The airport has really changed since we were last there...it's airconditioned and bigger! This is a wonderful resort with bright smiling and friendly faces in abundance, especially my husband's when he walked down the beach every day. Just remember, you're not in Kansas anymore, be opened minded and ENJOY! We will go back again!

<Content>Loved It! Just got back from a trip to Iberostar, Punta Cana from July 23-30. If you remeber one thing when you go there it is this: DO NOT EAT AT THE BUFFETS!!! They are absolutely discusting.. I lived on bread and sprite for two days before discovering the buffet by the beach on the Dominicana side. That is my only complaint about the trip. The people who work there are unbelievable!!! Everything is soooo clean and they are at your every call for anything you need; and they are so polite while doing it. Star friends are THE BEST!!!! They are such fun people and I can honestly say that they made our week!! The beach was gorgeaous- but one thing that you may want to know is that Punta Cana- by Iberostar is not the Carribean. The Carribean is a 20 min. boat ride which I highly recommend; you see a bunch of coral and they take you in the middle or the ocean where you can get out of the boat and the water is only up to your chest!! That was a blast. At night, go to the shows; they are VERY good! The disco is ok...alot of techno  the casino is kinda small, although a friend of mine won $300!! All in all, I would DEFENETLY go back to Iberostar..especially for the star friends!!! It was an awesome trip..if you want to have fun yet relax, go to this place!!

<Content>Great family hotel! This hotel is very nice. It has it's many pros and cons. Beautiful beach and pool. The pool is huge. Get your chairs early in the morning because they are usually taken by 10:30-11 AM. They had excellent shows at night. I recommend that you tip for better service anywhere. The island is beautiful but has a lot of poverty. Back to the hotel, it is great for families. We met many families from the states. We were lucky considering 60% of the people were Europeans. There is tons of food. All day long. The food is OK but they really try hard to make it. The restaurants require reservations and the men MUST wear pants to every restaurant except the buffet and steakhouse. The steakhouse, I thought was the best. The desserts everywhere were great. Do not drink the water, it will get you very sick. Hopefully before you go, you speak a little spanish. Majority of the people at the hotel and on the island speak spanish and no english. The people work very hard. They work 10 hour days, and try to please everyone. They are only paid about $80-$100 a month. It's really sad. There are many activities during the day at the pool. The drinks are great. (The Bahama Mama is the best!!) The rooms were nice, but a little small. I heard about and I also expierienced with bug problems in the room. I hope this review helped you. Enjoy Punta Cana it's a beautiful place!

<Content>DONT GO!! July 21-28DONT BOOK WITH FUNJET!!!!The hotel was clean and the people were nice. That is the only good thing I can say about our trip. The landscape was not as nice as the Dominican or Punta Cana which was not a big deal. The beach was full of seaweed, so we had to walk down to the other hotel to enjoy the beach. This hotel sits on the Alantic side, so you are not going to get the beautiful view like the caribbean. BEWARE!! My son and I love to snorkel and were disappointed in the cloudy water and lack of fish. We have gone to Cancun, Cozumel, St.Lucia, St.Thomas, Bahamas, and Santo Domingo. So we know what the real caribbean water is surpose to look like when snorkeling. If you want to do any excursions and you have children under 5 make sure you take you own equipment. They don't have any to fit the kids. For the adults I would do the same. They don't clean them, they just throw them into a tank of salt water. FOOD-it was not good. We even walked to the Dominican to eat. We wanted to know if was any better. I was sick by the second day and none of us would drink the water. All we would drink was bottled. DON'T EVEN RINSE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH UNDER THE WATER. This is how we think we got sick.TIPPING- The maid is the only person we gave to. She was great with keeping our frig full with bottle water and sodas.EXCURSIONS-They were too expensive and only maybe a couple were worth doing. Swimmimg with the Star Fish **, Four Wheelers**, and Monster Truck***.SHOPPING- There are shops along the beach resort but not much bargaining can be done. We paid for a taxi ($8 each way) to the Plaza Bavado. There is tons of shops and they are begging you to look in each store and buy. This is were you can bargain. The DR people love the cup coolers they sell at walmart. They will bargain for the cups.On the way home we landed in Houston (700pm) due to bad weather in Dallas. We sat on the landing for 3 1/2hrs, then sat in a closed airport for 3hrs. Then we sat at the gate for another hour just for them to tells us, buses will pick us up at 5am. At this point it was 2am and we decided to rent a car. It was a nightmare!! Ryan International left 158 passengers stranded in Houston. Funjet didn't care about all the complaints. This is one of the worst vacations!! When you start talking to the other guests on the property, they too were disappointed.Do your research and talk with other prior guest before you venture to Punta Cana.

<Content>The Most AMAZING Resort!!!! The man who wrote below made the resort seem as if it was horrible. I beg to differ. There were NO ants anywhere, and the restaurants were great. The only problem we had on our vacation was that my friend cut her foot open while landing on the boat after parasailing, and there was infact a First Aid Station right behind the beach. The nurse offered to do everything for her and gave us a personal shuttle to the pharmecy, where we were able to purchase bandaids, gaws, and antiseptics. Perhaps a stubbed toe is not considered a injury. Also, the workers always had a smile on their face, and walked around the resort all day long telling you when they were going to be doing an actitvity. When we got our drinks and food, we always brought them back to our chairs near the pool. We were infact aloud to bring our food and drinks away from the bar. I only speak a little amount of spanish, and i only used it once, to tell the maid to please come back to clean our room in a half hour. No one else knew spanish, and found it wasnt necessary to know it. Most of the workers spoke fluent english, except for the maids. On two of the night, we blew a fuse by using two hairdryers at once, and we called guest services. They immediately sent a very nice man out to help us on both occasions. We also had trouble with our safe, but we were also given exceptional service, and were helped immediately. There were in fact snacks to munch on all day long. The buffet next to the pool is open all day, along with the bars. There is an ice cream hut, which provides great ice cream all day long, along with fruits, popcorn, nachos...ect. You must remember that this resort does not only cater to americans, but europeans as well, who do not have a diet of chips and candy bars. We requested a pool side room, and were given one no more then 10 feet away from the pool. The beach was amazing. There was no sign of any trash at all on the resort. The workers were always overly friendly, despite the fact that they are way under paid and only get 3 days off after 11 full days from 9am to 1am. The disco was a lot of fun. The japanese restaurant was also exceptional, except for the soup, which smelled like fish water. Thats ok though, it makes a good laugh. After all this is another country we are in. The rooms were great, and the bathrooms were very nice. You must remember that you are in the carribean, and that the weather will be hot. I found this nice, since i am from buffalo. If you get sweaty, then why dont you go swimming? I have never stayed at a nicer place. I wrote a more organized detailed review at debbiesdominicantravel.com if you would like to read more about the place. I recommend this place to everyone! It was definately well worth the money.

<Content>Would not go back and not recommend! The main hotel staff needs work on their customer service, check-in, reception, guest services and checkout. We had requested an ocean view room by e-mail and was given poor excuse for not getting one. We had to call for many room repairs, terrace door, air conditioning, safe, and refrigerator. Rooms could use some upgrading loose floor tile, paint, repairs to wood, and yes, small red bugs everywhere, not what I expected for a 6 gold Apple resort. We missed out on a lot of activities, need to keep guest more informed about special events. Housekeeping and restaurant servers very friendly and work hard, we tipped them generously. Food was good, different from what we Americans are used to but that made if interesting. Beach is beautiful but if you want to relax this is not the place. Speedboats constantly going buy and then you have the smell of motorboat exhaust. Check out was not pleasant, I have tried several times to make call to states even with hotel operator help I did not connect. When I tried to explain to check out clerk, his answer was if it rings more than 3 times you pay. So I paid for phone calls, and my friend had to pay for missing safe key taken by hotel staff that came to repair it.I hope this review helps others, vacations are very special and you want to have little or no aggravations.

<Content>Anyone with a bad review is just hard to please! Five of my friends and I stayed at the Iberostar during the week of Easter and it was amazing...anyone who complains is just hard to please. The rooms were absolutely beautiful and were always clean. With four girls in one room, that is quite a task! The food was excellent, I am a very picky eater and I ate something I loved every night. We ate at the Steakhouse, and the Japanese resturant and both were excellent. The other nights we just ate at the buffet. That was my favorite place to eat because there was so much variety. If you don't want to try something new, they have pizza, pasta, hamburgers...anything to keep you happy. You aren't in America, so dont expect the food to taste like it does in America, some food has a different flavor but it's still very delicious. Make sure you wake up early enough to get the breakfast buffet in the lobby. It's to die for. We didn't take advantage of the room service, but why would you want to stay in your room and eat when there is so much beauty around the resort anyway? Also, don't expect snacks like Doritos and Candybars by the pool. If you want those, simply go to the gift shop and buy them. Personally, I think fruit is much more refreshing on a hot day than Doritos, but that's just my opinion. While I'm on the subject, you have to eat the fruit. I can't even eat the fruit here anymore because it's not nearly as good as it was in Punta Cana. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. There are flamingos and peacocks everywhere just walking around. The palm trees and little lakes looked like the came straight out of a movie. We spent most of our time by the pool instead of the beach. I do suggest waking up early and putting towels down to reserve chairs...if you put a beach bag on a chair or leave your shoes, nobody would bother them. The water was so clear and the sand was so white. There was never any trash around. There are so many activities and the Star Friends want to get you involved in every single one. There is a sign by the pool that shows the activities schedule every day. Everything is in pictures too, so even if you don't speak the same language, you know what's going on. They try to get you involved in all the activities they do, but aren't pushy. We participated in the dancing by the pool and the water aerobics. These people are truly amazing, they work for such little money and still have the best attitude about their jobs you can imagine. Also, if you stub your toe on something, I'm sure the resort will help you before you bleed to death. Some people are a bit dramatic when it comes to customer service. Reminder, your not in America...don't expect everyone to know English!!!We really didn't spend that much time in the other two resorts. We went to the other that was selling jewlelry, and that was alot of fun. We also went about 3 or 4 times to the disco. Very fun! You really don't need transportation to get you to the other resorts. It's about a 10 minute walk...max. Why on earth would someone wait for transportation when they can just walk? Besides, You get to slow down and look at all the beautiful scenery. It's very pretty at night time. It is very hot and humid, but the only person you can complain about that to is God, and I'm sure he has other concerns to take care of. They give you plenty of bottled water and a whole gallon in your bathroom to brush your teeth with. We left a note asking for more water for the next day, and sure enough, there was another gallon. We didn't go on any excursions, but our other friends from Ohio did and said it was great. Now as far as diarrhea goes, I never had a problem, but if you think you might, bring some Immodium or Pepto. Once again, why would you expect all of the locals to know English? This isn't America. Be patient with them, they are very excited to learn. Most people at the Iberostar aren't even from America. They come from Italy, Germany, France....So it's interesting. Overall, we had a wonderful time at the Bavaro. We plan to go back again.

<Content>Fabulous! Just got back- July 17-21. Five days and four nights was way too short. We really only had three full days to enjoy-big mistake-needed more. When planning, we did not know anyone that had ever been nor had we ever heard of it- it was so random-so we picked a short trip thinking it is better to leave wanting to come back than to be ready to leave the second day if it was a disappointment. My husband and I are 43 and took two 19 year old college girls with us (our daughter and best friend). When the teenagers are miserable, everyone is miserable so I thought I would play it safe. FAR from a disappointment. We will be back and will stay for a full week. I was so depressed the last full day I can't even explain it. The sun sets at 7 p.m. We arrived the airport as it was setting. Awesome place. Open air aeropuerta, no problems. Very quaint and welcoming. Probably the best airport experience ever, international or domestic! Easy, easy, easy.The FUNJET host on the bus, Matthew, was great. He was actually from New York, spent some time in Oklahoma and was very informative on the differences in cultures because he has experienced them both now. The ride to the resort was dark but once we got there, truly amazing. Lobby and checkin was beautiful and the staff awesome. HOLA to OLGA!! I love her!! The beach was well lit and beautiful-even what you could not see at night. We knew we had made the right decision. We caught the show already in progress..FUN!!, then made our way to the casino (next door at the Dominicana- HEY RAMONE! The Pit manager!). Small, open air but we are the adventurous type. We headed for blackjack and had a great time....every night we were there until 3 a.m. Won, lost, won, lost- played with FUN people. HELLO Lindsay and Stephanie, the Jersey girls!! (and yes, it is safe to walk ALL THE WAY back to your room at the next resort that time of night) A great, peaceful, romantic stroll. As we walked around the resort at night, very well lit, we could not wait until the sun came up the next day to see the beauty for the first time. And we did.... the grounds, the pool, the beach. I thought I was in the Garden of Eden. No way to explain.I will comment on the negatives I have read and also provide some tips. Rooms- wasn't in it much. Smelled like the ocean or anywhere else we've been by the sea. Gambled until 3 a.m., bed at 4 a.m. got up at 9 a.m.- breakfast, beach, pool, dinner. That was our three day schedule. TOO short. Marble bathrooms, tile floor, fridge was cold, room temp. was just right, no ants but did have a small lizard by our door. Thankfully on the outside but what can I say....in Dallas, we have bugs!!!!Humidity- nothing as bad as I expected after reading the reviews. It is worse in Mexico and South Padre Island and some days Dallas this time of year. Rain- the last night for about ten minutes. Clouds blew in from the sea. Beautiful. We ran under the beach bar. It poured rain. We had a drink. Listened to merengue (our beach bartender Ysidro played songs over and over) The rain stopped. We took a nap afterwards under a palapa. It doesn't get much better than that. The majority of the trip was FULL SUN! That's what we went for. The beach barbeque was a blast. Great food, merengue dancing, lots of culture here!Food-struggled a little but we knew that going into it. We ate at the steak house (now we're used to Texas beef cut real thick and still moo'in) so the steak was a bit of a disappointment but what else can you expect? Don't expect great spaghetti here if you're from Italy, right? Same principle. When in Rome.... We ate at the Japanese. Very tasty (to us) but I'll bet the Japanese could be critical. And don't expect the steaks to be from Texas. Si? Put your wild and adventurous hat on and sneak a taste of the weird looking fruit they have. It might surprise you! And it's good for you! They are all about the natural food they eat here. They grow it, they profit from it, they live off of it and they are proud. Try it!! And the beach bar serves up a great hot dog and chips (fries). We had our share. The water...everyone one will tell you from the bus ride to the orientation (FUNJET) Don't drink the tap water! This is true- they are referring to the water you get from your hotel room ONLY. Use the bottled water in your fridge to rinse when brushing your teeth- drink the bottled water in your room and aside from that, any water or ice you are served at the hotel restaurants or bars, including the beach bar and the casino, is filtered by the hotel. We ordered and drank it all five days- only one of us had a slight problem but probably more from the food we were eating. And it wasn't a real problem, just frequent but not did not slow her down. Take Immodium with you... just in case. Shopping-amazingly, we found the best prices at the shop at the resort. Where else can you purchase three liters of Dominican rum and three pounds of Dominican coffee for $24 US?? SHOCKING! And we are enjoying them now back in the states and this alone was worth the trip!! I can't wait to get back and purchase more. You are allowed 2 liters of dark rum per person, 4 pounds of coffee per person, and not sure on tobacco. No Cuban cigars, obviously, you can't bring them to USA because it is illegal to trade with them, but you can bring back limits of Dominican tobacco. Do not buy the white rum-151 proof. They will not allow it on the plane PERIOD, even in check-on bags and they will search your suitcase. It is flammable according to airport personnel. Stick with the dark rum anyway. White rum is like gasoline. The beach flea market was a great time! I bought some things and the bargaining is great there... not to mention fun. Whatever the price, offer less than half and go from there. Caribbean Street is a path that runs between the Bavaro and the Dominicana (both Iberostar) and they have some good deals, too. Mosquitos- NONE. Not one bite until we got back to Texas. We even took bug spray and never used it. And we're talkin late nights around the grounds, early mornings, etc. I suggest taking it but don't let the stories keep you away.Beach- Beautiful paradise. White sand, blue water, palm trees. Truly the Corona commercial- you know the one I'm talking about. And plenty of chairs. Yes, topless girls. Some need to keep theirs on where my husband would argue that some needed to take theirs off! But there are many Europeans. This is what they do. The pool- beautiful at night but by day... does need a paint job under the bridge but who really cares?? I read the complaints about not being able to get chairs- we didn't spend much time at the pool. Only after we came in off the beach we relaxed by the pool in some fresh water and the swim-up bar to socialiaze. We never had a problem getting a chair at 6 p.m. after coming from our nap on the beach. We never really tried before that. Keep in mind we live in Texas and most of us have a pool so we don't travel to a beach resort to spend the day at the pool. If you are going for the pool, however, you may need to get there a little early for chairs. TIPS:INSULATED MUGS: Do your homework like I did... my family loves me for it. I was a hero and the envy of other guests who did not know. Take insulated drinking thermoses for everyone. Any bar (lobby, pool, beach, or otherwise) will fill your insulated mug with your drink. This keeps it colder than the small, plastic cups you get served by the pool and beach plus saves you a few trips! I could get a mug of Pina Colada at the beach and it would last forever without getting hot! We even filled our mugs, walked down the beach to the flea market, shopped and still had our mugs with cold drinks by the time we got back! WALKIE-TALKIES- these come in very handy. If your husband is heading for the beach while you are staying behind gathering other things, then he realizes he forgot something, he can radio you and ask you to bring it! Saves lots of time! If you are thinking about staying here, DO IT! And if you stay at the Bavaro Suites, you get all the benefits of the other two properties on the resort, DOMINICANA and PUNTA CANA. All the restaurants, shows, pools, casino, everything! I wish I could say more about the excursions. I've heard while we were there and read everything that they are great. We were there for such a short time and did not take advantage but will next year, for sure!, when we go back. STAY HERE! You will not regret it. Can't wait to get back. The only thing that might hold me back next year is if I decide to hunt down Kenny Chesney at St. Crouix or St. Thomas. All you Texans and Tennessians know what I'm talkin about. Help me out.

<Content>Don't recommend this place to anyone from a developed country My wife and I stayed seven nights at this resort for our honeymoon. We were there from July 12 to July 19. We were told that we would get a non-smoking room on an second floor with an ocean view. When we arrived, we were told that none of the rooms were non-smoking and we were placed on the ground floor. The first evening we noticed that our sliding patio glass door did not lock, so I called guest services to complain and they said they would send someone immediately. We waited an hour and then I called back. They again said someone would be there immediately. We ended up falling asleep holding our passports and valuables. The next day we marched to the front desk and demanded another room. We got one then. This room was better, and the sliding door locked. We wanted to use the safe, but the bolts were out and we needed someone to reset the thing for us, so I called and it took two days to fix that problem. The food was alright, but nothing to brag about. For an all-inclusive resort, it sure was limited. The room service was included, but only had about five items on the menu. The best meal for dinner was a hot dog or hamburger. We were told we could snack all day long and have all the drinks we could drink. This was true, but all the drinks had to be consumed at the place you got them at, and the snacks were not what we call snacks. They were hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, hamburgers, fruit. I was expecting Duritos, candy bars...junk food snacks. All of the food, including the snack food, had to be eaten at the restaurant/bar where you got them at. Nothing could be brought back to the rooms. The grounds were beautiful, with flamingos and peacocks walking around. There were man-made ponds with tons of fish and turtles. That was the best thing about the place. The beach was nice, but not as beautiful as one would have been at Aruba or the Bahamas. The worst thing about this resort is the customer service. The place had tons of activities, with maps in the rooms showing where they were, but if you needed any clarification or wanted to know what the schedules were, they wouldn't tell you. They'd just say, there's a board way over there....just look for yourself. The staff never went out of their way to help at all. Very disappointing. For it being a 6-star resort, I thought the Days Inns here did better jobs. The weather was great, and only rained one time during the day. When the walkways get wet, look out. It's dangerously slippery. My wife stubbed her toe while coming down the stairs. It started bleeding, so we went to the front desk. When we asked for some first aid, we were told that there was none. They told us to walk over to the supermarket and buy our own supplies! Nice service. When I walked over to the supermarket, I learned that they didn't even carry Peroxide, rubbing alcohol, or bandaids. The next resort over had a pharmacy. I walked the 5-minutes over there and found out that they were closed. My wife was bleeding and this place had nothing to stop it, or prevent it from getting infected. Thank God she didn't seriously cut herself...she would have bled to death! The resort would send us free mini bottles of rum with a fruit plate almost every day because they messed up, but that didn't satisfy us. They even had the maids leave us tee-shirts with the resort logo on them. Yeah...like I'll be wearing those any time soon. They'll make good rags though. The resort offered free transportation between the three Iberostars that were next to each other there in Punta Cana. The first time we did it, the staff was very quick and we got immediate service. That was the first night though. The other six nights we found that if anyone was busy, you ended up waiting a half hour (10 minutes to them) for someone to take you anywhere. We ended up just walking to the places. The only problem with walking was that it was so humid there, that if you walked any long distance, your clothing stuck to you with sweat. I lost five pounds being there seven days from sweating so much. All of the building are open except your sleeping room. At night you would sit there eating dinner or waiting for a ride for a half hour and just start dripping with sweat. I constantly had to dab my forehead and face with a towel or napkin to soak up the sweat. My face broke out with acne because it was so oily all day long. Their restaurants were buffets, and if you wanted the nice places, you had to make reservations with the guest services. Then they would only allow you to make THREE for the seven nights you were there. Not very unlimited all-inclusive as we expected. You can't drink the tap water or you'll get sick. We used bottled water to brush our teeth. We took an excursion outside of the resort and realized that this country was pretty bad off. The people live in little sheds with tin roofs and the thing that got to us the most was the amount of trash that was everywhere. There are literally no trash cans in the whole country. As you drive along the roads, there is trash lining the sides. The yards of the homes had trash all over the whole yard. People just lived with it there. They have their own cattle which they butcher and serve hamburgers from. That may explain why I got diarrhea from eating a hamburger for lunch on our fifth day there. Their fancy steak house had like five steaks on their menu. No Filet Mignon or Prime Rib. Just chop steak, ribeye, and some other steak I had never heard of. There was also a chicken breast you could get. If you didn't know Spanish while there, beware... The locals didn't hardly know any English. People we spoke with who didn't know any Spanish really had a hard time. The waitstaff and store employees didn't know any English. My wife, thank God, knew Spanish. I felt as though she was my translater. I know a little Spanish and was speaking it mostly. There are mostly Germans, French, Italians, and Americans at the three Iberostar resorts there. It's a family resort with little kids running around, so if you want some place romantic, don't chose this place. In the Caribbean there are these tiny ants that are almost transparent. They are literally everywhere. In your sleeping rooms, restaurants, everywhere. We were eating at one of the fancy restaurants one night and got to the dessert. My wife noticed these ants crawling all over it. We both lost our appetites and left. Overall we were disappointed in the resort and will never return for any reason. And we plan on writing a letter of complaint to the corporate headquarters. :(

<Content>Outstanding....and I've been around! My husband and I spent our 20th wedding anniversary at the Iberostar Bavaro July 18-22. We have traveled a lot in the Caribbean, staying at many 5 star places. These include the Iberostar Tucan in the Riviera Maya, the El Conquestador in Puerto Rico and many others. We thoroughly enjoyed our vacation and would highly recommend this property to anyone who wants a quality all inclusive with an international flavor. I have outlined the details below:Arrival- Took USA 3000 with Apple Vacations from Atlanta. They both did an amazing job. Meal and movie in flight...even games!!! Arrival at the airport was rather smooth. The airport is a huge Palapa! The drive to the hotel may be enjoyed by some more if they keep their eyes shut. You could get a bit nervous seeing how the real people live on the island and wonder if you are really going to paradise!Check-in and Room- Check in was smooth and quick. Requested a king bed, second floor. Did not even ask for ocean front, because I knew there were not many. I got exactly what I asked for. The room was a nice suprise. I had read that rooms needed updating. It seems that they must have updated the linens in our room as they were very fresh and clean. The room did not smell as musty as many I have stayed in on the beach. I did not even burn the candles I brought! Keep in mind that if you stay close to the beach and pool, you will have to walk a ways to the lobby and restaurants and vice-versa. No way around this!This may be one reason to consider the Punta Cana and Dominica sides. Also, bring an umbrella! If it rains...you'll get wet getting from room/anywhere.Grounds- The nicest I have seen with the exception of Maui! Mosquitos were at a minimum. I usually get eaten alive- but I only got about a half dozen during my trip.Beach- A+ Plenty of chairs and palapas! Most importantly, I noticed that there were more available in front of the Bavaro than the two other Iberostars. And if you really want to feel privileged, just look down the beach at the other resorts. We were the only resorts with the palapas on the beach!!!Pool- Can't complain. It was harder to find a chair here, but the pool was very nice and the activities by the pool kept you entertained in the afternoon. Star friends really worked nonstop and were very friendly!Topless Sunbathing- Sure, about 1 in 4 ladies on the beach, a few by the pool. My husband and I come from a conservative background and all I can say is.....better to have your teen-age son experience nudity in a natural environnent such as this rather than how most american boys first experience it (pornography)! A great place for someone to try European sunbathing without pretence.Food- Okay, this is a five star all-inclusive. Not a five star EP resort. I always expect an all-inclusive to have fair food, nothing more. The Iberostar exceeded my expectations. We tryed the Gourmet and the Japanese restaurants. Both were very good, but don't miss the Gourmet if you must choose. The buffets were good. The drinks were stronger than I expected. Maybe because, unlike Cancun it did not seem like a drinking contest all the time. Hubby and I both experienced slight intestinal discomfort, nothing serious. The service was always great!Tipping- We brought $50 in ones and gave it all out in the four nights. We felt no pressure to tip, but wanted to anyway. Check-out- We got an extra two hours in our room by permission. Watch out for this, at 12 noon they turned off our keys so we got locked out of our room. They even called us to check out. But, we remembered the name of the employee who gave us permission so everything was cool. We did not want to leave! Departure was very smooth. Important note about the airport....only one part of the terminal has air conditioning. Many don't realize that there is air conditioning and sit in the heat for hours! Just head over to terminal 2.We will definately be back to Punta Cana. Also, it is my experience that the Iberostar chain is a class act and I highly recommend them overall! E-mail me if you have any questions!

<Content>A very nice week. We had a very nice time. Not perfect but not bad at all. As I read other reviews I can understand how the can have such different opinions. It is my opinion, however, that most overstate the experience for better or worse. There was not much that was completely perfect or disappointing about our experience.The FOOD options could have been a bit better but I still think I gained weight. The BEACH was great. There was a bit of sea weed but nothing that seemed to cause anyone any problems.The ROOMS were just fine. Not ice cold but there was a fan over the bead that worked great. They did not look new inside but not warn out by a long shot. The decor was Caribbean influenced so there was not have the refined look that you would see in a nice downtown hotel in a big city. We slept great. The STAFF worked very hard with smiles on there faces. Communication was a bit of a trick some times but never a real problem. We tipped a fair amount but did not see many others doing so. Those working seemed to appreciate it but they were just as nice when we did not tip.A few words about Apple Vacations. They took care of everything. I think that is the best thing I could say for them.Overall a very nice trip. If you go down there looking for problems you may find a few but we were not and did not. A week was about the right amount of time for us to spend there. In a few years we may go back.

<Content>Great Time, Wonderful People, HOT AND HUMID! Traveled to Iberostar Punta Cana on 7/3-7/10/04 as part of Apple Vacations Tour. My wife and I had never been outside of the US and really had a great experience. The staff is very friendly, and willing to do anything they can to make your stay comfortable.AIRPORT - We were not given an option of flying directly to Punta Cana Airport, instead we were routed to La Romana, and had to take a private bus to the resort. Wouldn't do this again, the bus ride took nearly 2hrs, and all you need to know is that in DR they drive much differently than in the US.RESORT - Very nice, everything is open air, very little of the resort outside of your room and some of the restaurants is air-conditioned. Plenty of bars, bathrooms, and staff. Rooms were fine, the Dominicana and Punta Cana offer single rooms, the Bavarro is more like condo's with multiple bedrooms. Also, the Bavaro is considered 6 Star, while the Dominicana and Punta Cana resorts are considered 5 Star - meaning you will be charged for drinks at the Bavarro if you aren't a guest there - while Bavarro guest can go anywhere in the three resorts for free. Each resort has a different colored wrist band you are required to wear during your stay. FOOD - There are 2 buffets open for all meals, one is considered European Styled the other American Styled. At times the food could be hit or miss, no joke - they were serving pork chops and veal for breakfast. The restaurants at the resort, which require reservations, are very good, they have 5 to choose from Mexican, Caribbean, Japanese, Steakhouse, and a fixed menu Gourmet Restaurant. We ate at all but the Caribbean and found the food to be fantastic. Don't miss out, the buffet doesn't compare.MONEY - Take about $40 in $1 bills, as it is very hard to get change there at the resort. Everyone will tell you to use your own currency and not exchange for Dominican Peso's as you will lose when you exchange back. Tipping the maid can seriously improve the drink supply in your mini-bar. Also, take all the sunscreen, toiletries, and anything else you can think of because the supermarket at the resort is about 4X the usual price on items. My wife bought a Snickers bar for $1.65 USD - Hawaiian Tropic Sunscreen was $22 USD. BEACH - Awesome, sand is white and soft, no shells. Each morning there is resort staff members down raking the sand and throwing out seaweed to make the apperance immaculate. One thing of note - many Topless Women are on the beach - while this may not offend you - it will definitely bother your wife if she has never been exposed to it before. Also, if you have teen children you may want to warn them about staring. We saw everything from 15-70 year old women without tops. All in all, a very nice place to visit, the summer is obviously the hottest time of the year, we found it to be quite hot at times, but this would be great in the Spring or Fall. Very friendly people who work really hard to keep you entertained and taken care of, while probably not making much money. Tourism is there number 1 income in the country. Resorts were very safe, never saw any problems, lots of security officers (not armed) and staff always around.

<Content>pure sexy atmosphere, hot hot hot My hubby and I stayed here last year. We loved it. We loved all the nature on this resort. The rooms were suites and nicely decorated. The pools and beach were beautiful. We had no issues with the food. The only time we felt sick was the next morning. Only because we got completely hammered the night before in the disco. The nightly entertainment was very enjoyable. The service was good. We enjoyed walking to the other two resorts and checking them out. The disco was at the Iberostar next door. Wow did we dance the night away each night. The blended Blind Russians are a must, I was slant eyed by the pool each day. Basically, if you want a romantic, beautiful, fun escape... stay here. It is as much fun as YOU make it. We were here alone and could not have had more fun. Just did our thing. (--)

<Content>The hotel and it's staff "really" know how to please. We went to Punta Cana over a year ago, and we had the best time of our life. The room, the food, the service, and the shows were well done and professional. The staff really works hard, and the service is top notch. We are going again Aug. 9 2004, and we're really looking forward to it. We take 2-3 trips a year, this was our best yet.

<Content>Loved every minute of it! Iberostar Bavaro was a dream! I went there June 21-28,2004, through Apple Vacations (very nice). The weather was VERY humid. Even though I was told June is the wettest season there, it only rained about twice, and only lasted about 10 minutes or less. The lobby and most restaurants are open, no walls! Being in the Iberostar Bavaro, we had access to all activities in other hotels, including disco (dance club), casino, gift shops, and many more! The staff worked so hard all day long, but they were always smiling, friendly, and greeted you, from the bar to the beach to the hotel maids. Everyone was so friendly! They had awesome shows every night, including for the kids! There were many funny shows including using the audience, and some were dance shows and theme shows! Most staff spoke English, some better than others. The host of the shows spoke at least 5 different languages, so you're definitely not left out! One complaint about the whole vacation was the tiny ants in the bathroom; however, they were only there in the mornings. Also, the mini fridge is not keep stuff that cold. We always found open lounge chairs on the beach, no matter what time we went, and usually a hut for the shade! The pool; however, was harder to find a chair. We only laid out on the beach so we usually found at least one chair at the pool for our items. The ocean was beautiful and the sand was so soft and clean! There were many different tours to take. Our favorite was the Quad Safari because you actually rode your own four wheeler through the streets of the town, you also went to another beach and went to a really nice cave you can swim in. One thing to be aware of is when shopping anywhere other than hotel lobbies, you should bargain and check prices first! They will definitely try to rip you off, and believe me they want your money so they'll bargain! This vacation was really nice! I would love to go back!

<Content>A wonderful time We stayed in Punta Cana, Iberostar Bavaro from June 30 - July 7 and had a great time. Our timing was good because for most of our stay, the resort wasn't overcrowded with people until after the July 4 holiday. The weather was excellent, average temp 86 and sunny. The beaches were gorgeous and water warm. The pool was big enough and not too crowded. However, we did have a hard time getting a lounge chair by the pool after 7/4. Need to get out there early to claim a chair. Careful the sun is extreme and you'll burn without realizing it. Bring extra sun lotion because we ran out and had to spend $20 in the gift shop for a small tube. Also the snokel equipment at the resort is dissappointing so bring your own. The room was spacious but initially smelled a little musty but subsided after a while. Room service was excellent (were given plenty of towels and clean linen). The food was good. The Iberostar offers the best buffet out of all their resorts. Try and eat at the steak house, we had a great meal. We went on three excursions, the safari, the maranarium and manati park. We enjoyed the safari and got to see more of the island and locals. Plan for a long day 8-4:00 but it was worth it. Our favorite excursion was the maranarium (half day), the snorkelling was excellent and you can swim with sting rays and nurse sharks. It was a lot of fun. Manati park was okay, it's a small zoo and you can swim with a dolphin. But be aware it's $70.00 for a 5 minute swim. I read many reviews about rude europeans but we really didn't encounter any. Also topless sun bathing was mainly seen on the beach not by the pool area and really wasn't a big deal. The Iberostar staff were enjoyable and extremely accommodating. Overall, a great trip.

<Content>Great Vacation! My husband and I had a great time! We went July 5th to July 13th. Flight: USA3000 was great. No delays, no issues.Room: Nice and clean. We left the maid $2 everyday on the pillows, nothing was stolen. The room did smell musty, but helloooo, your in 95% humidity everyday! We brought some dryer sheets and air freshener with us. The A/C kicks on when you enter your room and kicks off when you leave. It did stay on throughout the night. We had no issues with the A/C. We did not have any hot water when we got into the room, but once I notified the front desk, we had it by the end of the day. No ants, we were too far away from the beach to have them. Resort: Gorgeous! The maintenance was just impeccable, so many people just taking care of the grounds, it was unbelievable. The resort is huge, be prepared to do alot of walking. Food: The Japonese restaurant was the best place we found. The Steak house was okay. The Star Rock Cafe was horrible, the food and the service. My husband was up all night long vomitting after we ate there. I was fine. The buffet was the best thing around. I didn't know there were so many ways to cook a potato! There was something for everyone. And if you couldn't find anything to eat, you had a problem and should have stayed home. What kind of a getaway would it be if they had a Taco Bell and McDonald's!! Yuck!Drinks: The first day I had 3 Margarita's at 3 different places, and not one of them tasted the same nor did they taste like they do in the states. Not a big deal. Plenty of other drinks to try. (Remember, keep an open mind and you will have a great time!) We drank their bottled beer Soberana, otherwise if you ask for beer you will get their draft Presidente. Which, really, isn't too bad either. People: Mostly European. Alot of French and German people. Alot of kids. The pool area was just infested with all these kids. If I had known that, I probably would not have stayed there, but my husband was insistent on going there. He agreed at the end of the trip that it would be a great place when we have kids. But we did have fun, hands down. My husband and I went on this trip as a delayed honeymoon, so we weren't interested in meeting people anyway, it was a trip for just the 2 of us. The Iberostar people were nothing but friendly! Can't say enough about them. Beach: Beautiful! The water was just beautiful, warm and clear. The only thing I didn't like about the sand was that some of the smokers did not use the ashtrays under the palapas, so there were butts here and there on the beach. By the way, this place is a smokers paradise. You can smoke anywhere anytime.It was a beautiful resort and a great vacation. Keep an open mind and you will enjoy yourself. Remember, you're not in Kansas anymore. If your NOT open minded, go to DisneyWorld!!!

<Content>Had a Great Time We just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro. We vacationed with 5 other people  had a wonderful time from July 10th to July 17th. The hotel is absolutely beautiful with georgous grounds  kept very good. The rooms were kept clean with a well stocked refrigerator  also beautiful. Plenty of soda, beer, water. The pool  beach are great. Peacocks walking around the grounds. So pretty. The food was good at the buffet  some of the specialty restaurants. However, the choices at the specialty restaurants were not a lot. But they do accommodate you  give you something else if you don't like what is on the menu. Wonderful people that work there. They can't do enough for you. All the staff is wonderful. We would go back to this hotel. We also had hot weather with rain at night. It was just great. I rate this a 5 star hotel. The prices at the hotel gift shop are cheaper so check the prices 1st.

<Content>No international beverages We were happy with the Iberostar overall but there were a couple of things that could use improvement. First of all, they advertise international beverages which they DO NOT have. We specifically chose this package through Funjet Vacations because of that. We also complained about this and yes, that is advertised and we were given no compensation either through Funjet or the Iberostar Management. Due to this, we will not book at this hotel again. Also, they advertise 8 or 9 restaurants, but neglect to tell you that a reservation is required. To make this you must stand in line between 8 and 10 am. We mainly had to take what they had available and where. Not much choice.

<Content>Not a five star hotel This is not a five star hotel at all. The food is allright nothing to brag about. You could always find something to eat at the buffet but there is nothing at the resaurants. The hotel rooms are worse then the ones at Motel 6. They have scratches everywhere. The furnature is old and ugly. I have seen five star hotel rooms and there rooms are not five star. They may have one or two good nightly shows but the other ones make you want to sleep. There is nothing to do in the area of Punta Cana except the hotel. The sun is really strong and it is easy to be burned. The hotel service is also not five star. In five star hotels people are always friendly and want to help. Here the front desk people are sometimes rude and rarley smile. When you see some of the other five star hotels in the world such as Atlantis. You really can't compare it to this one. This is no more than a two star hotel. I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very nice place/uncomfortable for people of color to stay Stayed at the resort from july 7-14, 2004 enjoyed the getaway and enjoyed being in Punta Cana. The resort itself is very beautiful with a very nice beach and pool. Like a reader before me said the resort was very european visited and i found myself at times a little uncomfortable. I continuously got stared at as if i were a human oddity at times being of African American ethnicity i felt as though many of the europeans were astonished to see a person of color enjoying the resort and not working there. This also made my son who is 12 very uncomfortable and i needed to constantly explain that everyone does'nt have the same views on people of color as many americans do. However the few americans that were at the resort were extremely friendly which was a delight. The weather was pretty nice rained in the evenings but for the most part you were able to enjoy the entire day. Food was nice many options to choose from at the buffet. Don't waste your time at the steakhouse the food was sub par and it took an extremely long time to come. The room was clean but i had a ground floor room and it was on the beach which was great but i kept having a problem with small ants in the closet where my suit cases and clothes were. Also the mini bar fridge was terrible it only kept beverages a little colder than room temp. The staff was the friendliest that i have ever encountered in any carribbean island I would give the dominican staff very high marks for the way they treat you and make your stay perfect. I did feel sorry for them when i found out they have to work 11 straight days with only 3 off and they only get paid approx. 13 US dollars a day therefor the tips they got were greatly appreciated and needed. I do intend to return to the Dominican Republic but I dont think i will be returning to the Iberostar resorts I felt as though as a person of color this may not be the perfect place to stay but if you don't mind people staring at you like a piece of meat than enjoy yourself.

<Content>Disappointed My family and I just returned from Iberostar Bavaro. We stayed at the resort from July 4-July 11, 2004. Let me first say that we have traveled to a couple all inclusives before...Sandals Negril and Riu Palace Mexico and have also cruised frequently. We flew out of Chicago on USA 3000. Minimal hassles and we arrived on time. Check in at hotel was fine. We traveled with another family and we had rooms next to each other, which was very convenient, because the resort it huge. The room is large, but is showing its age. Furnishings and flooring is old. Bathroom seemed dirty and had a strange odor for most of the trip. The shower leaked out onto the floor...the shower curtain is too small for the shower. The size of the room was a plus because we were traveling with 4 of us.FOOD: Food was fair. I was disappointed in the a la carte restaurants and happier with the buffet. It was very hot in the restaurants as they are not air conditioned. Kids ate pizza every night. No one got sick from the food, but we stayed away from the salads. I would give the food a C.BEACH: Beach was beautiful. Some rocky parts in the water...watch out, stubbed my toe several times. More seaweed than I expected. Wide beach with many palapas. Never had a problem finding one. A-POOL: Old and grungy. Hair, sand, dirt floating in it. Never saw anyone cleaning it. One positive about the pool was that it was shallow enough for the kids to play in and still touch the bottom. Definately needs improvement. C- ENTERTAINMENT: Good..B. Kids loved the kids part of the show at the beginning every night. Combination of professional and staff shows, with audience participation. Very hot at night in the lounge area.BARS: WE had a lot of trouble getting the drinks we wanted. We wanted a specialty gin that they served but kept in back so no one would see it. Everytime we ordered a gin and tonic with this gin, it was a 50- 50 chance of getting it right. We always tipped well when they got it, but they should have gotten it right in the first place. Make sure to ask for mucho rum or tequila as they vary on the amount they give you.PEOPLE: Very friendly and extremely hard working. They put in long days.EXCURSIONS: We only took one to Saona Island. A lot of fun...long bus trip to La Romana, catamaran to a gorgeous island , lunch then speed boat back. Everyone in our group enjoyed it...however the bus ride is long and one person in our group got motion sick with the ride so be warned. A-OVERALL: I would give this vacation a B- overall. WE had fun, but prefer Mexico. The resort is showing its age and definately needs some updating. We won't be returning to this resort.

<Content>Beautiful place ! Iberostar Bavaro is such a beautiful place! The grounds are spectacular and the staff is too! My husband  I stayed there June 5-June12, 2004. Basically, all the good things already said about Iberostar Bavaro are true. Arrival at Punta Cana airport was uneventful. The employees were efficient  courteous. One of the few things that were negative was the check-in. The check-in desk people were not exactly the friendliest. We had emailed regarding our room preferences and it had been totally disregarded. After a few minutes of ASSERTING myself our room was reassigned. Other than that the check-in was pretty quick. The buffet was fine at all 3 meals. It is VERY international, well-presented and good quality. We went to 2 of the restaurants. The steak house was very good and the atmosphere was much quieter than the buffet. We also went to the international restaurant (sea-food). Although, it wasn't exactly our types of food, we had a very nice meal there. Also, it was air-conditioned, which was nice. Breakfast, our favorite meal, was good. They make these home-made donuts which are to die for!! And those freshly made banana shakes....! We usually ate lunch at the pool-side grill. Basically, food is served all day there- from the MORE than continental breakfast thru lunch and until the steak house is set up to open. Lots of snacks too plus the ice cream shack. We ate the lunch buffet one day but preferred the outside grill. Paella was made on the beach one day- delicious!Our room was VERY clean. We burned some candles to freshen up the room. We had no problems with A/C- temp was just right. I left a note for the housekeeper to take the reg. soda and stock extra water  beer  Coke Lite. (that is Diet Coke) No problem. I left a $1 bill everyday with a small gift. I also practised my Spanish by writing thanks everyday. We spent little time in our room.The grounds are SPECTACULAR. Lot's of birds- peacocks everywhere, flamingos and lots more. They were always working on the grounds. The plants were gorgeous! I just can't say enough.The atmosphere is very laid back here. Lots of places to hang out. LOTS of shade around the pool and beach. The ocean was great and the pool was nice. We didn't especially like the snorkeling- the reef is dead and other than some fish there was nothing else that we saw. Sad....This is a FAMILY resort. LOTS of kids (make note of this). We originally were to have our 21 year old son with us- he would have been BORED. This is NOT a singles place. The entertainment was also more family oriented and when it was more adult, the kids were still all there. Some parents need to know when it is time to put their kids to bed. Also, we didn't find this to be a particularly friendly place. It was a very international group of people there. Americans were the minority. People seem to just go about their business and not seem to want to become friends with others. We have stayed at Breezes Bahamas and Sandals Royal Bahamian and other places and it was MUCH MORE friendlier at those places. The Star Friends were very friendly though. And most spoke 3-4 languages! The other employees were friendly too. They all encouraged you when you tried to speak in Spanish! The weather was good. It was very humid though. It rained a couple of nights but never in the day. There was always a breeze. It was the humidity that got to us more than the heat. Wear plenty of sunblock! This is a very safe place, even in the dark. Well lit. VERY BIG- be ready to walk to get anywhere. The resort is very remote. There is nothing there other than the 3 Iberostar places. We did not go on any day trips. The dress is VERY casual. We had NO problem with the old GI system. We only drank bottled water in our room. We drank the water in the restaurants. We used ice and we ate salads  fruit. Don't use the tap water to brush your teeth. They give you gallon jugs of water for that. We ate live-culture yogurt for 2 weeks before we went. Took lots of Pepto Bismol and Imodium with us, but thankfully didn't need it. We even had a prescription for Cipro, just in case. We had NO problems. Just don't drink too much (alcohol, soda, creme to coconut can all cause diarrhea. Don't eat too much of the DELICIOUS fresh fruit, especially the pineapple. Also, don't eat too many fried foods. It is not a HEALTHY oil they are using! And don't overeat- oh! those desserts.......So, as you can see, we had a nice time. I would definately stay at another Iberostar resort somewhere else. Don't think we will return to Dominican Republic. We felt bad that so many people live in poverty- made us uncomfortable. But that's just us. Tourism is the #1 industry, so we were helping them by coming there. Location/grounds A+Room ABeach/Pool BFood BWeather AStaff/Star friends AAirport A-Atmosphere/Friendliness COverall: B+

<Content>Nice resort, could improve June 22-29th This is a very nice resort, but could use some improvements. I have traveled to many caribbean destinations, and this was not one of my favorites. As other reviews state, the grounds are beautiful and very well maintained, staff were very friendly, but there are a few things to aware of before booking if you are used to a 6 star resort.1. If traveling with children, the food is not what they are used to. 2. All inclusive, but limited items on room service menu. They do not deliver any refreshments to your room, nor do they allow any to be taken to your room. 3. The beach is somewhat clean, the ocean full of seaweed. 4. Rafts and pool items are not allowed in pool area. 5. The rooms do not have ice buckets, and the mini fridge is very warm. When leaving your room, the power goes off, including the air conditioner until you return. There are tiny ants all over the room, including and especially in the bathroom, on the sink, etc. If you turn the light on in the middle of the night, you will see them in your bed as well.6. There is a musty smell in the room that attaches to your clothing and travel bags. I have laundered my clothes three times, and it is still present. I have sprayed febreeze on my travel bags daily since my return.The highpoint of my trip was the Outback Safari, a must.

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro - Great trip We just returned from a trip to Punta Cana. We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro. In December my wife and I celebrated out 25 anniversary by going to Punta Cana. We stayed at the Dominicana then. We like it so much that we suggested returning for my parents 50 th. anniversary this past June. The entire famiily came on the trip. A total of 14. Ages ranged from 76 to 2 and everyone had a great time. I have read many reviews and think some folks are a bit particular when it comes to the food. Our first trip while at the Dominicana we were not able to eat at the Bavaro facilities. That was partly the reason we wanted to try the Bavaro this time. I found the buffet menu to be quite large. I cannot believe anyone cannot locate something they like. There were 7 different stations set up as buffets plus bread stations and areas to make toast. The drinks were all served to you and as soon as you were done eating your plates were removed from the table. There were some items that were from the islands like fruit and some type of sausage that were different but try it and if you don't like it ..find something else!! The specialty restaurants were ok. The service in the gourmet restaurant was a bit slow. We were not all served at the same time so it made it a bit akward. Also the steak house dinner was at the grill by the pool so it was a bit hot even though it was 8:00 at night. To make matters worst there are no clg. fans and they drop cloths over the side entrances to keep the bugs out. The mediterranian restaurant was a nice surprise. Air conditioned and bright colored. The food was mostly seafood. There was a great appetizer and dessert buffet. I heard the japaneese restaurant was very good but we did not try it. The bars were all great. Can't recall when I drank so much rum last. Did not go to the disco or the cafe by the casino but I did try the casino. Had a really good time. all the folks at our black jack table were from the US. Lost 50.00 after 2 nights but my brother walked away with 400.00 so I guess the family came out ahead.The extra acivities offered thorugh apple vacations were good. The outback safari was really great. Our guide Antonio Tony was incredible. Amazing when you go to a third world country and most of the folks there do not have a high school education but speak 5 different languages. Makes you wonder who the under educated really are? The 4 wheeler expedition was very well organized and fun. The equipment was in very good shape. They are getting some large safari carts and will be offering rental on them soon. I had a chance to see one of them. Really cool. Took the speedboat expedition also. The snorkeling was gret. The equipment was no the best. My first boat the transmission blew and left me stranded in the water. The next boat was filled with water and had to be drained. Then I opend it up , went about 200 yards and it died. Water in the fuel. So we waited again and finally they brought us another boat. Finally we made it to the mother ship to snorkle. Again, that was great. Better than the marinarium we tried in December.The accomodations were very nice. The layout of the rooms is what they call a JR suite. bathroom is seperate and there is a 2 level area where the bed is then 2 couches and a table with desk on the lower portion. Room service was included along with the mini bar. Amazing how much beer you can drink when it is all included!All in all we had a great time. There are alot of activities offered by the hotel as well as if you want to try some of the excursions. You will not be disappointed. I find myself thinking of the beach quite often and the island girls too. Oops, hope my wife is not reading this. ENJOY!

<Content>Vistors from Lancaster, OH June 28 thru July 5 The weather was great, the resort and ocean were beautiful. Words cannot do Iberostar Bavaro justice, you must see it for yourself so I will leave it at that. The Dominican people are the greatest! That is what I want to emphasize in my review. They are friendly and hard-working. You can put the all-inclusive trip on your credit card, but the love you receive is priceless. For example, the towel girl doubled as one of the Star Friends entertainers at night. I saw here every morning at 8 am to get our clean towels for the day, and then saw her at the show every night. She works 16 hours a day. I'm not sure when she gets a day off, but she was there working all 7 days of our trip. Yet she always greeted me with a smile. and threw friendly kisses at me when she would see me at the night club.Then I must tell you about the sweet ice cream girl. She gave out ice cream at the pool during the day and then worked as a server at the night club at night. Since I never had a watch, she was my offical time keeper. I must have asked her 10 times a day Que hora es. senorita? After a while, I didn't even have to ask. As soon as she saw me coming, she would look at her watch and give me the time. One night she recognized me at the club and came over and gave me a big friendly hug, and told my wife that I was her friend. Yea, I did say priceless didn't I. Now on tipping. It appeared to me that the service you receive is not affected at all by tipping or not tipping. However, I personally felt good about tipping these wonderful people who work so hard for so little. You are probaly thinking, right, no wonder the towel girl and ice cream girl were so friendly, since I tipped them. On the contrary, I did not tip them at all until I was ready to leave and they certainly were not expecting anything from me except a sad good-bye.The snorkeling is fantastic at the beach at the resort. Take some bread with you and you will be swarmed by fish in an instant. BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE CORAL! THE WATER IS SHALLOW AND THE CORAL IS SHARP.I can hardly wait to return, but sadly to say my wife got a bad case of the traveler's sickness and she says she may never go back. Hopefully, she will change her mind by next summer.I want to thank the reservation staff who gave us a beautiful suite near the pool as I had requested, and I want to express my thanks to all of the staff at Iberostar Bavarofor such great service!Halo

<Content>The Perfect Vacation I went to the Iberostar Bavaro from June 7-11 and i can say i wasn't there long enough... Let me start by saying that the grounnds were absolutely gorgeous. Peacocks and flamingos all around. Next the suites were beautiful, big and comfortable. The food was good to me, but then again i like hispanic food and am not particularly picky. The beach is everything u hear it is, clean with clear water and the sand is like powder. Plenty of shade and i found spots anytime we went. The pool is great too, plenty of space to lounge and a good swim up bar thats in the shade. My wife enjoyed the shows at night, i liked the disco more. But what makes the place is the people working there. Everyone was so friendly and made u feel welcome in their country. If u try to speak a little spanish it will take u a long way with the people.(although most do speak some english)Bring alot of singles for tips. I went through $100 in just 5 days but i enjoyed tipping and received a little extra attention from the staff. All in all i would rate this to be the best vacation i have been on and i have been all over the Carribean. I am planning a return trip already. BTw if u go see my buddy Alex in the buffet area. he was the best waiter i've ever had....

<Content>Best people on earth! First, let me say that I'm hesitant to rave about the Iberostar Bavaro because I don't want it to become flooded with people (and especially Americans, of which I am one! If anyone could draw the joy out of the Dominicans, it would likely be grumpy, selfish Americans... I know, I know: a huge generalization but proven true with 24 hours of my return stateside. I'm still suffering from culture shock).I have vacationed before at beautiful beaches with great hotels and food; however, NOTHING compares with the level of service I found at Bavaro. Any positive energy you put out will come back to you tenfold from these incredible people. I'm sure, though, if you're one of those fault-finders with negative energy, your experience will be different. I need not repeat all the great information I read on this site prior to going. It's all there. I do recommend, however, bringing your own plastic mug, cup with lid, or whatever. They'll happily make whatever drink you'd like in whatever you hand them -- easier to bring a larger container of your own than the little ones at the beach bar. Oh, and get the fries down on the beach. They're the best! Chippies!If you're going in the next few months, I'd love for you to email me directly. There are a few photos I'd appreciate you bringing down to some new friends who work there....Regardless, you're destined to have a fantastic time! I'll be going back very soon!

<Content>Very nice but not 6 star Apple vacations made all the travel as easy as could be- excellent. The hotel is beautiful  the rooms are very good. The food is good but not excellent, met some Americans complaining about the food and said they couldn't eat it- we enjoyed the change of cuisine. If these people expect to go to a foreign country and eat the same they are WRONG! If they want American food I suggest they stay in USA. The people working at the hotel were generally very helpful  polite especially the front desk  guest services, however things move much slower than at home. Enjoyed it  may go back but we like to try different places. We were a family of 5 (including 2 late teenagers) and we all had an enjoyable time.

<Content>IB in a nutshell....... Resort: Large, lush tropical, and well-maintained with the best part being the beach. Food: Steak house was good, dinner buffet better than all the a la carte restaurants, based on wide selection and taste.Tours: Outback Tour a must....period!People: The staff at the resort make this place...from the Star Friends, wait staff, maids, and front desk. The Dominicans are very friendly and warm and hard-working (most fluent in 3-4 languages)Dos: Attend Apple reception/tour, trousers for men in a la carte restaurant, use the gal. water provided for brushing teeth, bring inflatables for kids,imodium, tylenol, spanish translation book, $100-$200 in singles (saying gracias after ordering 4 drinks in polite-leaving a buck or 2 says you mean it!)

<Content>Loved it! My family and I just returned from our stay at Iberostar Punta Cana from June 18th - 25th. We had 11 family members with us - ages 9, 14, 15, 32, 34, 35, 39, 43, 50  55 (a wide variety of age groups) and we all had an excellent time. I had read these reviews for weeks before we went and was nervous about some of the bad reviews. Thankfully, I went with an open mind - I now realize that the bad reviews may be because some of us are spoiled Americans. I was pleasantly pleased with our week stay.The resort is amazingly beautiful, clean and well manicured constantly throughout the day. I never saw a single piece of trash or an overgrown scrub. The beach was the most beautiful I'd seen - blue/green waters, soft, white sand - not a single shell either. We spend most of our time right there - either in the ocean, sunning or taking a nap under a wonderfully shaded palapa. Never once had a problem getting chairs (and we needed 11!). There was always a palapa open right up front. The pool seemed a bit crowded but always chairs open there. We got to the beach by 9 or 9:30 without saving any chairs and never had a problem.The staff is so helpful and friendly. Again, never a problem with the language - most people spoke enough English to get by or we spoke Spanish (or at least tried to) considering we were in their country. The most problem with language we had was the other guests who were from other countries but not the staff. The food - so/so - we always found something we liked because the buffets are very large. Of course, it's not exactly how we eat here in America but then again - you aren't IN America. The specialty restaurants were all very good. Again, no problems making reservations there either for a large party. There is food out all day long so you never go hungry and never have to eat by a certain time.The only problem we had was it was so humid - it was hard to take and we are from Philadelphia. The heat  humid did sometimes leave my husband and I with no appetite come dinner time but we usually made up for it at the great breakfast buffet (my favorite).My mother-in-law is a travel agent and booked this trip for us - I owe her one. It was the cheapest, best trip we have ever taken.My family did the swim with the dolphins excursion which they felt was too rushed for the money they spent but still fun. And we also did the Outback Safari. We learned a lot and had a great time. If you can go on that excursion and see the poverty in this country and still come back and complain because your 50 choices of what to eat for dinner aren't necessarily to your liking - you must be very self centered and heartless. I felt a lot of guilty returning to this beautiful resort after seeing how these people live.The rooms were very nice and spacious, great water pressure in the shower, everything in our room worked perfectly, never a problem, no real bug problems,leaks or air conditioning issues as others have complained about.My few dislikes were:brochure said there was room service - there is none. The nightlife wasn't so great (we did find an air conditioned bar - The Star Rock and spend most of our time there).A few tips - bring lots of small bills - ones and fives - a little tipping goes a long way there! My parents stayed in the Bavaro Suites and we were all in the Punta Cana which is a very long walk - ask the bellboys for a ride on the golf carts - we tipped them about $2 each time and they jumped to give us the rides.Get a Miami Vice(frosty drink) - not on the menu but delicious.I brought nail polish, lip stick and candy for our maid ( a suggestion I got on this website) - I asked her for more Diet Coke and left her these things and had a case of diet Coke in my room that day!I could go on all day about what a great time we had and how nice this place is. If you have any specific questions or concerns, feel free to email me!

<Content>Liked it but didn't love it! My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro Punta Cana from June 18-25 which was booked through Apple Vacations. Here are some of my thoughts about the trip....(keeping in mind that my husband is an airline pilot and we travel all over the place!)1. Apple Vacations did a good job with the flight. On time and efficient. They also did a good job with the airport transfers to the hotel and back to the airport.2. Resort is beautiful. Grounds are impeccable. Rooms are consistent to what others say. I would compare the rooms to a Holiday Inn as well. The housekeepers did a great job with keeping them clean. I tipped them daily and gave them little gifts such as sample perfumes, trinkets from Dollar Tree, etc. (the employees live and work at the resort for 11 days straight and then have 3 days off to go home to their families. You will see the same employees in morning as you do at night.)3. The food is average. If you have never been out of the US then this may be a challenge for you. The speciality restaurants were good. We never ate at the Mexican but the Japanese, Gourmet and Steak House were good. Buffet was good too with so many choices to choose from.4. The beach is beautiful! Yes, there are topless women but this hotel is a European Company and there are a lot of Europeans and this is standard for them. 5. We did one tour a couple of days before we left- La Romana - Altos de Chavon. My husband found it to be ok and I didn't particulary enjoy it. Way too long to be on a bus with your teeth rattling the whole way. (And it didn't help that a 2 year old vommited on the bus and that's all we smelled the enitre ride.) I did however like Altos de Chavon, this place was fantastic!!! I could have spent the entire day there. It's where the rich and famous go! Beautiful hand sewn linens at a place called Batey's in Altos de Chavon. 6. All and all the trip was ok. I can't say that I would go back but that's because we like to see different places and there are so many islands to choose from. It is hot and humid but we're from Florida and we are use to it. The people are probably the most friendliest I've ever seen out of all the places that I have been. The smartest thing I did was take the advice from some of the reviews and that is to take $100 single dollar bills and tip the employees when you found it necessary to. (even though they say tips are included, yeah right!) They are so grateful and I felt like I was helping them. If you are going, have a great trip and keep an open mind. Oh by the way, take your hair dryer. The one in the room is not worth the power it took to use it.

<Content>I grade it C as satisfactory. I was there from 6/14-21 with Apple Vacation. I grade it C as satisfactory. Nothing remarkable, but nothing particularly bad either. I will not go back.Room-C-. Oversized and with nice bathroom it needs major renovation. Tiny ants are everywhere. If you turn light at night, you can see them in your bed. They do not bite, just major nuisance. Treatment will not help because the ground and wall outside covered by them. Room is reasonably soundproof, but overall quality is of second rate Holiday Inn.Ground-A. Beautiful, well kept. Ladies, bring flats. Sidewalks are made from stone and uneven. The walking distances could be up to 10 min. Beach- B-. Plenty of shadow. Before 9 you can get front row, but even at 11 you can get some. Reef is very close to the beach. It does not provide entertainment, but is an obstacle for swimming. I recommend swimming shoes if you plan to wander there.Drinks -A. Cocktails are good, they have good brands basics. Food-C-. I recommend restaurants. They have airconditioners. Buffet is on the air. Food gets spoiled quick. Most troubling observation-they do not replace old plates with new, but mix them together. I was very careful and survived, my husband has diarrhea last 2 days, 3 days later he developed fever and is not well. We met several families, all has some problems. Kids, especially teens, are first to go. Be very careful.

<Content>Relax and enjoy but take your own snacks! We are a family of three, 47, 40 and 10 years old. We travel frequently at no less than 4 star resorts. So here's our opinion. We were there for 7 days 6/12-6/19 2004.The property is beautiful and very well maintained. The room was quite large and very clean. We had a slight problem with a ceiling leak in our room the first night so they moved us and upgraded us to a suite upon our request at no extra charge..Get to the pool and/or beach by 7 am to reserve primo seats and mats for the plastic loungers, you will be so much more comfortable! The pool and beach are fantastic! We enjoyed both each day. Our daughter was bored at first because the kid's program is really geared to the smaller kids age 4-6. Nothing really for our daughters age group. Then after the 2nd day she met other girls her age and had fun from then on. My husband and daughter did archery, darts and shooting. They had lots of fun.We prefer waiters to deliver our drinks to us by the pool and beach....No one does that here. You have to go get it yourself which I guess is no big deal, but it is quite a walk to the bar. And it's just really nice when someone does it for you.The food...okay this is the real honest truth...They have lots of variety at the buffet and we could usually find something we liked. But, remember you are in another country and we Americans are very spoiled to excellent food with lots of flavor. But they don't have that here. They really do try but frankly, it's not very tasty. As long as you keep in mind that you are not going for the food you'll be happy. The Steakhouse, Gourmet and Mexican restaraunts were very good. Men must wear long pants at all reservation required restaraunts.We probably won't go back simply because we like Cancun, Riviera Maya much better. The flight is shorter and the food is better. I think withn a few years the Dom Rep will improve and become better at accomodating those of us who travel frequently and are more discerning travelers. However, if you are not terribly particular about food and poolside service I'm sure you will enjoy this property very much.Be very careful of the sun exposure!! We used 45 sunblock and did not get burned. But we did get tanned. The sun and sea breeze will burn you if you are not EXTREMEMLY CAUTIOUS.We took one excursion. The Marinarium to swim with the stingarys and nurse sharks $70 ea adult and $35 child. We enjoyed it very much.We did go the casino each night. We only played blackjack. We had good luck at the casino as long as we played only blackjack. Stay away from the machines. More than half of them did not work at all! And I don't believe thay are governed by any gaming commission. The casino is not air conditioned but they did have fans by the table games which made it more comfortable.

<Content>absolutly great let me start off saying that i am so sad to be back home...the resort was wonderful, as you probably read in most of the reviews already...the grounds were wonderful,so many of those loud peacocks walking around... the beach was clear as can be...Went to the Iberostar Bavaro may 28-june 4th, with my boyfriend. As soon as we got on the plane i knew it was going to be great. Went with apple vacations and they took care of everything, make sure to get the insurance in the case the price goes down (which for us it did)...the straight through flight was painless. When you get to the resort you get offered a drink from the bar, the dominicans know how to take care of you. About 30 mins after being there we checked into our rooms, the golf cart rode us and our luggage to the door... The room was large and the bed was comfortable, even the bathrooms were nice. We went on the Sanoa Island tour, i think it was around 70 a person, wouldnt really recommend this, the beach that you went to was pretty dirty and there wasnt much to do. The shows at night were great, make sure you participate in them, you will have a blast, expecially with the Star Friends...We took about 120.00 dollar bills, and between the bar servers and maids and everyone else we ran out on the 5th day. At night the beach is deserted...there were many times me and my boyfriend were the only ones on it. Make sure you bring snorkling gear, we rented some for an hour but then went and bougth some at the gift shop for only about 16.00 apiece...Go to caribbean street and bargin bargin bargin, some beautiful paintings there, the guys started off at 160.00 but i got them for 40.00...yes the casino is small probably only about 50 slots and 10 tables, we did come out winning at the end... we went to the buffet at least 2 times a day, what ever you are in the mood for that night they have it, the one night was american night and they had some great steaks and ribs, my boyfriend liked the steaks so much the chef personally brought him over to more...these are the friendilest people you will every meet, we will def. return to this resort, hopefully for our honeymoon!so all in all...Go here, have a good time...and as everyone says in the dominican NO PROBLEM!!!feel free to email me with any questions ill be happy to help you from a travel agent point of view...thanks for reading, have a good day

<Content>Interesting Week in Punta Cana Arrived June 11th and got hit with HIGH humidity coming off the plane. The positives: Apple Vacations did a great job with flights on time and getting us to and from the hotel. (45 min from landing to hotel) Check in was a breeze. Grounds were beautiful. We had a first floor room and had no problems with bugs. The weather was beautiful the entire week. There was a few showers but that was mainly overnite. The beach sand was soft (Cancun has a more powdery softer sand). There is an afternoon tea from 4-6. The spa was good for a swedish massage but be careful with reflexology. I had bruises afterward. The negatives: Food was below average in comparison to other Caribbean spots (Bahamas, Mexico) but not horrible. 60% of the women are topless on the beach and an occasional one at the pool. Steak restaurant is outside under roof as well as the buffet and entertainment complex. If the humidity is high, it's uncomfortable as heck. The vendors are a total ripoff in the hotel shops. The flea markets aren't bad. Bought a necklace that started at their price of 45 and got it for 15 and another one that was 35 and got that for 5. There is bargaining power. Best restaurant was Japenese appetizers, best airconditioned restaurant Star Rock Cafe, best frozen drinks Lobby Bar, best coffee was at home but found having one third cup of their coffee with the rest hot milk wasn't too bad. Casino wasn't worth going. There is a new hotel just opened Bahia Principe that is offering great rates with every restaurant airconditioned and the pool area is fantastic. I'm sorry we didn't know about it. If you are traveling for sun and beach, this is worthwhile.

<Content>Loved ever single bit of it! There are no words to explain Punta Cana, R.D.! It was beautiful. The Iberostar Bavaro Resort was like a fantasy come true. I have to admit after reading the reviews that were posted made me a little skeptical. We even tried to cancel the trip, but decided to go ahead with it and make the best of it. Boy, am I glad we did! Since we were traveling with kids we did not know what to expect, but when we arrived at the airport there were VIP Travel associates waiting for us and directed us to our buses. Also when we arrived at the resort we had a sort overview of the resort and the amenities with Nicole. She was awesome! She kinda told us all the do's and don'ts, which was very helpful. The breakfast and lunch buffets are delicious, my husband and I enjoyed the evening buffet but the kids didn't. But that was okay, after a day they got use to the food. But the gourmet restaurants are awesome! If you go get reservations as soon as you can. The poeple there were very helpful. Including the 2 excursions that we took. We went to Manati Park, which was awesome. Our kids got a chance to swim with dolphins and we saw a Taino Ritual dance(that was cool). The other excursion was Bavaro Splash, that was truly amazing. I am not a very good swimmer but successfully was able to drive the speed boat and snorkel. The crew with Bavaro Splash made us feel comfortable and that helped alot in enjoying the excursion. We only spent 4 days there and that is truly not enough. Here is a little tid bit, make sure not to drink the water, even when brushing your teeth. We didn't get sick but it was strongly recommended not to consume any water at the resort. The hotel provides you bottled water if you need more than what is provided in the mini-bar, so do ask. And when you go to any of the restaruants they have purified water that will not make you sick. Next year we will definitely return to Punta Cana and stay at Iberostar Bavaro. Another tid-bit, when you stay at the Iberostar Bavaro Suites you have access to Punta Cana and the Dominicana resorts.

<Content>perfect Hi,We got back from Iberostar Bavaro a week ago. It was a perfect vacation, the only problem - just one week : ).For the people that are complaining - not the resort is the problem, they have a big problem, this people should stay home.Lots of food and all kind. We went with our 16 month old son, we brought lots of jars with food for him, never used them, he ate the food from the resort and loved it, never got sick.The first room we got in has an A/C problem, we told the reception and moved to a beach room. The room was very clean and nice. We got the crib we've requested in no time. I think the people that don't get what they want don't know how to ask for staff, probable they are demanding everything with a bad attitude, a smile will do it.The people there are very friendly and helpful, and the Star Friend are so cool, my son loved them.Don't forget the shows they have every evening, they are so much fun.I'll go back there any time, and I really hope I can get back in a year or two.

<Content>Should have listened! Visited D.R. Iberostar Bravaro 5/23-5/30. I read the reviews, realized how subjective they were, decided to go with an open mind. Negatives: First, Apple Vacations has the hotel rated a 6 star...this is such an exaggeration. Stayed at an Iberostar 5 star last year in Mexico and it truly was. Bavaro is 3-3.5 max. Overall, the resort food is pretty bad. Japanese restaurant was the best, the Steak House ribeyes are about as thick as those served at Waffle House. Had to use a steak knife on the snapper at the Tropical - decided it would be a good thing not to eat. Got terribly sick while there even though I had eaten yogurt for a week prior to the trip. D.R. beer sucks. Maid jacked a pair of sunglasses. Having the hair dryer in the bathroom (lacking ventilation) makes no sense - it heats up the room - so you're drying your hair and sweating at the same time. Duh. Hotel should have more chairs at beach - guests shouldn't have to rise early to reserve. The musk smelling spray that is used in the rooms is powerful...the odor still lingers on my luggage (I've Febreezed several times). Don't eat the mussels - they're way too fishy tasting. The frying oil used at the buffet is disgusting - it has a funky smell and anything fried has its taste. Too much European food. Casino is extremely smoky and too small. Positives: Hotel grounds are beautiful, bartenders were great. The Stars do their best to entertain you. The Broadway Review show was very impressive. Except for the sunglasses incident, the maid was good. Dominicans are very friendly. Had wonderful weather; the beach was beautiful. Outback Safari was fun. Enjoyed going to the Flea market and Carribbean Street. Check out the first tree on the right past the bridge (heading towards the beach) just before sunset - it's full of nesting peacocks. Alas, due to getting sick and the poor quality and selection of food, I won't be back.

<Content>Great vacation! - 06/04/04 - 06/11/04 Ola! My husband and I just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro this morning. This really is a beautiful resort as you have read here numerous times, so I will just tell you a few things that I did not see on the other reviews. Tours: The outback safari 鈥?its 75 bucks, and basically it鈥檚 a long truck ride through the countryside. That鈥檚 it. The jungle safari jeep holds 22 people who are crammed in like cattle, and there is no roof on the jeep, so it can get VERY hot. Be warned, wear a hat or suffer the consequences. They stop at a 鈥渢ypical鈥?Dominican house, which was not typical at all. These people who lived there were obviously paid by the Tour Company. The household has 6 kids living there, and the living room furniture is spotless white (off white). I don鈥檛 think so!! It had a 鈥榮taged鈥?feel to it. It was very interesting to see the countryside, and it is beautiful, but the roads are awful, so if you get any kind of motion sickness, this is not the trip for you. The one thing about that trip I will rave about is the end when they take you to a beach to swim鈥?that beach is literally the most beautiful beach I鈥檝e ever seen. Its has aqua blue water that seems to go on forever, and when you walk into the water, its waist high for at least 100 feet from the shore. It really was amazing. The guide told us that Iberostar just bought that beach and will begin building a resort there shortly. There is something else I must add, some of the money from this tour goes to build schools in the DR, and I want to make sure everyone knows that. The tour benefits the kids, and that needs to be said. We did visit a school on this tour too, and I鈥檓 embarrassed to say some of the tourists went and sat with the kids at their desks with their arm around the kids and asked for pictures to be taken鈥︹€?. what were they thinking??? These are not zoo exhibits people, the kids were actually writing their final exams and they should not have been disturbed in that way. Basically my point about this tour is that you should not go on it if you cant handle 7 hours in a crowded jeep. If you do want to get a feel for the country and see the land from the mountains to the beaches, this is definitely the tour for you.Oh, one tour I didn鈥檛 read much about was the marinarium tour. It鈥檚 a 陆 day snorkel tour that starts with a free swim snorkel. The coral is everywhere, and its very difficult not to hit it with your feet when you are swimming. They will not allow flippers and I can understand why. There were lots of caves and many fish, so this was awesome. The second part is a swim with the sharks/stingrays. That was amazing! I do feel bad for these sharks, they obviously do not want to be in a pen. They were all nurse sharks, and there were a few varieties of stingray. The sharks were up to 8 feet long, had my heart pounding a little! I would recommend that tour big time, it was amazing. At the end of the tour, they served drinks in the water at a shallow beach. It was a good time.Shopping: About the rum 鈥?do NOT buy the 151 rum!! We bought it in the gift shop, and then were not allowed to bring it home. Apparently its flammable and they will not allow you to bring it on the plane. Is this because of 911? Probably, but the store clerks will not tell you that! I think there should be a sign saying that, especially in the resort shops. We tried shopping at the beach shops, but I did not find that fun at all. The shop guys were talking in spanish to each other, obviously talking about us. I got a bad vibe from these guys, and the prices in the gift shop were exactly the same, if not cheaper. T-shirts in the shops at the resort were about 5 bucks, lets face it, you can鈥檛 get any cheaper than that. The only thing I was able to get cheaper on the beach was the jewelry. It ended up costing me about 7 bucks each for a basic ring, bracelet and pendant. 21.00 for all three. They started the pricing at about 20 bucks each piece, just remember, throw out a price and see what they say. Beach chairs: We never had a problem. Sometimes we went out at 7am with a towel, and other times at 10, and still no problem. We asked around about this because I read several different opinions on this site about the availability. Well, we were told that the resort this week had about 1100 people. Weeks like Christmas they overbook, and there can be as many people as 2400, so that explains why some people couldn鈥檛 get a lounger. We were also told that two weeks from now (mid june) it will be extremely busy, so that鈥檚 a bad time to go. May/ early June are the 鈥渟low鈥?times it seems, since the kids are not out of school yet. Food and drink: Try the mamajuana (it鈥檚 a drink, made from rum and sugar) its fabulous. Also give the midnight buffet a try, its got a limited selection, but worth it. The cook makes this specialty sandwich with ham, cheese and bacon, all grilled together like a grilled cheese. Its heaven, especially after many beverages. I鈥檓 going to call that the 鈥渉angover buster鈥?sandwich. Casino:This casino is not air conditioned, and its very hard to get into it when its so flippin hot in there!! We went every night to drop 10 bucks in, and I actually broke even. Maybe even a few bucks ahead. I did see some decent payouts in my short time there, I saw a 500.00 winner on a nickel machine. It鈥檚 not Vegas though, so don鈥檛 expect to come out a big winner. In conclusion, I would definitely rate this an above average resort. Hubby got a little sick, but after some immodium, he was back to his usual goofy self. We had a blast and look forward to going back. Book this resort with confidence, it鈥檚 a beautiful resort, great food, nice rooms, and the staff is always willing to help. I would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Unbelievable! Where to start?! Anyone who didnt have a good time at this place is nuts! From beginning to end it was incredible.  AIRPORT-We were so nicely greeted when we got off the plane and out transportation was waiting for us. We used GoGo travel. They were good!FRONT DESK- From the min we got off the bus and walked into the lobby they were super friendly. Check was smooth and very fast. We were on our way to our room in less than 5 min. Later in the week we had problems with the safe opening back up in our room. The desk was incredibly helpful.ROOM- Very nice. I read before I went that the rooms were a little musty, but I dont think it was bad at all. They rooms were comfortable and spacious. Make sure to tip ur maid. They take extra good care of you if you do!FOOD/BEV- The food is different. Different but good. If you go into it with an open mind and willing to try new things, its amazing. There is tons of normal food too! After being there 3 days I was so full I could barely move. My advice...pace yourself! We ate at the seafood place and the steak place...seafood being our favorite. ACTIVITIES- If you cant find something to do, you are crazzzzy! There is volleyball (beach and water), soccer, dancing by the pool, achery, water areobics, spanish lessons, pottery and TONS of other stuff. We did a couple of day excurious also. We swam with dolphins at Maintee park (sooo cool) parasailed, went horseback riding on the beach and did one called Bavaro Splash. Bavaro Splash was our favorite. Def. worth the money. Look into it!!! Its worth it.STAFF- They absolutly made my trip. I had more fun with the STAR friends every day than anything. Granted I am a 22 yr old female and those domincan men do love american women, but words cant even describe the fun we had. Not even just the guys, but the girls were great tooo! We made friends with everyone the first day and had a blast all week. We would hang out by the pool with them all day, and then dance the night away!! Anna, Joanna, Domingo, Roberto, Eduar, Alex and especially Diny(ladies, keep an eye out for Diny..hes a HOTTIE and a charmer) thank you for making this the best trip ever. We'll never forget the fun we had with you. My family and I cant wait to book our trip for next year.

<Content>Great Time!!!! My Husband Erik and I spent 9 days from May 27th-June 5th, 2004. We loved it.. the Hotel was nice and The People Are Wonderful. But it is not one of my favorite Islands, I probably would not return. You need to Eat at the Steak House and la sibela and the Japaneese restaurant they are wonderful you need to make reservations. So do it right away or you will miss out. The Buffets were not that great. Every morning I would run to a Hut and put down towels to mark our spot (I suggest you bring your own towels to mark your spot) and use their towels to dry yourself. I went out about 7:15 am and they we would get to the pool about 9:30 after breakfast. I suggest plenty of sun block!~!! I got sun poisioning and I am a medium skin tone and I tanned about 15 times before we left and I wore 30 sun block every day !!! and we got a lot of color!! but the sun is extremly strong and the salt water in the beach makes you burn!!! We did one excursion and I highly reccomend it!! It was Bavaro Splash-3 hours $60.00 per person. You drive your own speed boat (2 to a boat) to a catamaran and you snorkle for about 35 to 45 minutes. It was the highlight of our trip! We were told not to go outside of the resort other than to go on your excursions. The Casino is horrible DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! they use pesos and it is small and there is NO A/C!!!! Not worth it!!!! The rooms and the Grounds are Beautiful and The staff is very accomidating, it was our 2 year Anniversary June 1st so I at check in we asked to be upgraded to Ocean front and they did. They gave us a Bottle of Champagne to celebrate. Be careful they charge you to use an Iron after 2 hours...Ladies, Bring your own Blow Dryer their's is awful!!! There is no Alarm clock in the rooms ,so you never know what time it is...we used our cell phone as a clock and alram!!! If anyone has any questions feel free to e-mail me.

<Content>Iberostar Punta Cana May 22-29 My wife and I traveled to Punta Cana for a week of relaxation. This was our first visit to this location. After reading numerous reports at this site, we decided to go as most reports were very favorable. Here is my review of this location. The rooms were very spacious, very clean, did not have any type of smell, no cockroaches as some people state. We did see a very tiny ant now and then. I have more around my house and you probable do to. The maids did an excellent job. I made note of extra beer and type of soda to stock my refrig with and it was done the same day.The food was good, there was quite a variety. The restaurants were VERY CLEAN, and very well kept up. The service in the restaurants was excellent.The bars are good, the drinks are very good, they do not skimp on the booze. You need to be prepared to drink their local beer, howerver, it was not all that bad. They do carry American booze.The beach is GREAT, yes, there is topless. However, it is not as much as some of the people are putting in their notes. There are a lot of Europeans and this is the way they grew up and they are enjoying their vacation like you should enjoy yours. the staff is very nice, they cannot do enough for you. Especially the group of entertainers. Really good shows at night, and they really try hard to get everyone involved. If you go I would suggest dancing with CESA(really great dancer and great personality).I am looking forward to going back to Iberostar Punta Cana again. It was a great vacation.

<Content>What a holiday! The finest holiday I have ever been on. My wife and I are in our late 40's but still enjoy fun and thats exactly what the Hotel and staff gave us. Everything was excellent. Food, service, staff, entertainment, room ( Just the biggest bed I have ever slept in), I cannot put in words how much we enjoyed the two weeks we were there betwwen 23rd May and 6th June. Big bag of various nationalities staying. ( why the Latest comments of the Americans have to state europeans there is beyond me!) All pluses no minuses. Long flight but what do you expect its 4000 mile away.

<Content>Like Being in Heaven! Our experience at the Iberostar Bavaro seemed almost like what I imagine heaven will be like (minus the heat of course)! Thank you to the staff for all of your hard work to make this truly the best vacation of our lives. We are a couple in our mid 30's and traveled with another couple of similar age. Here are highlights of the trip:Travel-We flew on an Airbus 320 (USA 3000 Airline) from Atlanta directly to Punta Cana and back. The flight was excellent (just over 3 hours) and the crew was very friendly. We watched a movie and had a meal (as well as a few coctails). Excellent experience. The aiport in Punta Cana is small and very conveinant. The transport to and from the resort was flawless and comfortable. Apple Vacations-Very organized and they worked hard to prevent us from having to do any thinking and planning which allowed us to just relax and enjoy the experience. They have a 15 minute orientation the day after you arrive and give you all the information needed to have a great vacation.Bavaro Resort-Absolutely beautiful. This place was spectacular in all aspects. The rooms are very spacious and nice (the quality is comparible to a Holiday Inn Express) and the landscape is breathtaking. You did not have to look far to find food or drink and there were several nice shops with good prices. The staff works very hard to provide excellent service and entertainment and the result of that is tremendous and certainly appreciated.Food and Drink: You are able to eat from a high quality buffet from 6:00am-10:00pm. Room service is free 24/7, the mini bar is always stocked (included), and the specialty restraunts we went to were excellent. La Bellena is a must-we had a 5 course meal which included a whole Maine lobster as the entree. We were slightly disappointed with the Mexican Restraunt (compared to La Bellena) and if we had a do-over we would have gone to the Steak House (according to other's opinions). The rum drinks were very good but remember to ask for alcohol if that is your pleasure otherwise they do not put it in (Miami Vice was my favorite). The wine was fair at best (other than at La Bellena) and the beer is no more than tolerable (I was disappointed that they did not have American beer). But the bottom line is you can eat and drink all you want anytime so why complain. Beach/Weather-Beautiful. The sand is not as white as we are used to (Gulf Shores, AL-Panama City, FL) but is so soft and clean. The water is beautiful, clear, and refreshing and there is a lot of coral which makes snorkeling fantastic! Palm trees provide some shade and certainly increase the beauty. It is very sunny and hot but a slight breeze makes it so nice. About 1/4 women will sunbathe topless (about 1/4 of those are top shelf) and a few will walk around so be prepared if you have children. At night it is uncomfortably hot, you simply have to get used to it but if you want to stay cool then I suppose you should vacation in Alaska. We had bright sunshine with crystal blue skies for all but about 10 minutes during our 5 day visit.Entertainment-We took a 2 1/2 hour snorkel excursion (purchased through a beach vendor not the directly through the resort) and it was great!! Our only regret is that we did not have a waterproof camera (it cost $30 to buy one there which we should have done). We saw the most beautiful fish and had some swimming time in a private area as well as around caged sharks and manna rays. Parasailing is $75 per couple and deep sea fishing is $50 (bring artificial lures and you may be able to trade for a trip). My wife and I had a 30 minute massage on the beach for $30 each but you can get an hour for $40 at the spa. Our only regret is that we did not have time for the Safari Excursion but we did not want to lose a day on the beach. The casino is not owned by the resort and therefore not heavily marketed. It is small and hot but we had a lot of fun. It is easier to win at blackjack because the dealers frequently make mistakes (of course you only call them on it when it goes against you) but I spent most of my time playing stud poker against a dealer. They accept Dominican Pesos or American Dollars but the minimum bets with pesos are much less than dollars so if you are cheap like me then play with pesos. If you bring children there are many, many activities for them as well. Bottom line is if you do not have fun it is your own fault.Other tips: Take Sammy Sosa and Moises Alou baseball cards as well as hats, fragrances, make- up, and other items to trade. You may get sick so be prepared for that (immodium is a must) and lose a lot of weight before you go to make room for all the food. My advise is simple: Go to Punta Cana, stay at the Iberostar Bavaro and enjoy the vacation of your lifetime!!

<Content>Warning!! 5 day stay is not enough!!! Just a fantastic vacation!!! The rooms, service, grounds, facilities, were all fantastic. I've been lots of places, but never one so meticulously groomed. I cant recall a place I've seen more marble in my life. Every bathroom on the grounds is floor to ceiling marble, and spotlessly clean. Just a perfect beach. A huge selection of food, and always a lot available. Just know that their food has a lot of european influence, so it takes a little adjustment. The bars all make great drinks, they don't skimp. The staff is very friendly, and always willing to help. I routinely watched inspectors walking through the restaurants, insuring quality control. I actually saw one pick up a plate in a stack of dishes, that he thought was a little dirty, and he had the whole stack carted away and washed. A bit too anal for me, but its good to know they are that serious about it!!!  Certainly no complaints, except that I only stayed for 5 days. And since I didn't mention it, this resort is an unbelievable value!!! Enjoy!!!

<Content>Pure heaven!!! My group of 6, ages 18, 19, 21, 23, 47  51 stayed at Iberostar Punta Cana from May 26-30, 2004. The only upsetting thing to say is that it wasn't long enough. We went thru a travel agent and went thru Apple tours. Flew out of Chicago on a brand new USA 3000 plane and landed 4 hours later. The place is undescribable. Everyone was nice and funny, very helpful. Most spoke English or at least understood what you were trying to say. The Apple Reps are soooo funny and helpful. Temp. was around 90 but they say it felt more like 110. We didn't care, that was what we went for. Never had a cloud in the sky. Food was okay. Kids liked Cancun food better. But I didn't have to cook, I liked it. Drinks were good - and FREE! Entertainment at the Iberostar Dominican was awesome every nite. Took the Kon Tiki boat/snorking trip (1/2 day) 1:00-5:30. Had a blast. They sure know how to entertain. Practice up on your Limbo if you go. Drinks were good and again FREE! Snorkling was okay. We didn't use life jackets, just float tubes. To get really good pictures, ditch the floaty and go down and take some real close ups. Actually we got free snorkle gear on day at the resort and snorkled around in the swimming area. Saw plenty and the guys even saw a 4ft baraccua. Rooms were nice and cool. Yes they are musty and nothing wants to dry. And there are NO ALARM CLOCKS in the room, but you can call for wake up calls. But then again, you are on vacation and who wants to see a clock. Ate at the Steak House (outside) and you can wear dress shorts. The steaks were okay (better back home) and then we ate at Simba's - TO ELEGANT!. The place was nice, but the food was not to our liking, just not our life style. Oh well, it was an experience. Glad my kids don't like that eating style. It consisted of raw (we think) salmon, then asparagus soup (tasted and looked like pea soup), then a pastry shell with somthing and then finally what we were all waiting for - a LOBSTER TAIL. Now that was delicious. We are catamaran sailors and we took advantage of the free catamarans every day - they are small but in great shape. They will take you out if you don't sail. Parasailing was $85 couple so we didnt do that. The kids did the banana boat ride ($8) and had fun. My youngest had a picture taken on the beach by a photographer holding a monkey on her head and kissing her on the cheek ($6). Straw huts everywhere on the beach. Reserved 6 every morn just by putting something on them. Alot of topless women, but saw men in thongs and speedos too. Guess you could say, something for everyone. Walked to the far end of the beach and did some bartering with the dominican people. Not sure if we got any bargins, but was an experience. Withnessed a wedding on the beach. Neat. Not sure why some say they didn't care for the place, because not one of us could say one bad thing. We truely enjoyed ourselves. Would go back in a flash. Again, I am not saying Dominican Republic is the place to go, but the Iberostar hotel was the place to stay. I hear all Iberostar hotels are wonderful. Hope to try another one some year - if not the same one. Our pictures all turned out so great. Just used a disposable camera and what a remembrance we have. Hope you all have as great a time as we did. Don't miss a chance to go here. Would love to hear from you if you have any questions.

<Content>Such an Amazing Trip!! This vacation was paradise!! I cannot say enough good things about it. I too was worried because of all the bad reviews but we did not have one bad experience. There were 4 of us on the trip and we all were extremely excited to be there. The food was good, and I am a very picky eater. Not much of a variety, but what they did serve was good. The star friends were fun, the pool/beach buffets and bathrooms were so clean I was in shock! We kayaked, got massages, went on excursions (outback safari and swimming with dolphins). I recommend the outback safari, it is a long, hot day but you learn so much! And we bought coffee and cocoa from a family that made it right at their house! The hotel rooms were nice and the maids did a great job every day. We went to the tropical, the mexican and the asian restaurant. They were all very good.One tip - stay away from too many pina coladas by the pool......coconut milk is not very good on the stomach!

<Content>Don't go here!!! We traveled here during New Year's 2003/4. We used the Apple Vacation...first time  last time. The airline was awful, no reserved seats. How ridiculous not to put entire families together. Whatever. Hotel check-in, like a zoo. Long lines and chaotic. Totally disorganized. Hotel staff, bad attitudes and lazy. The room:(they call it a suite), smelled awful, a/c didn't work, they couldn't fix it and the room was musky (my luggage still stinks from this place). Called 4 times for a roll away bed, they did not bring it till the next day. My wife had an asthma attack due the the humidity and the cleaning solution smell in the room. Called the ER and they asked us to walk there. The front desk took forever to answer the phones and then they never did what was asked of them. Finally they sent a golf cart 20 min. later. The food was sub-par. The reservation restaurants were not to good, and hard to get a reservation at a resonable time. Had the most luck w/the buffet and could always find something to eat. If you didn't wake up by 5am to reserve your lounge chair then you wouldn't get one. THe staff really didn't care about anything. The excursions were basically overpriced and not very good. However, swimming with the dolphins was inexpensive and very cool. Do yourself a favor, find another hotel. We traveled across the island to the property at La Romana and it seemed much nicer. Would try that one on another trip possibly. Too few vacations and too many places to go to waste one on a bad place.

<Content>Wonderful Experience Wonderful experience. Iberostar Bavaro is a beautifully landscaped resort. The D.R. is the cleanest Caribbean place that I have visited. The resort is immaculate. The lobby is breathtaking and so is the beach. The pool is like a lagoon and is not overally crowded. D.R. natives are extremely nice and friendly. They try so hard to make your vacation one to remember. We used Apple Vacations and everything just flowed smoothly. They have your vacation very organized and the Apple Reps are extremely helpful. The airlines was USA 3000 and was wonderful. They serve a meal to you and you get to watch a movie. The food was fair at the resort. You definitely will not go hungry. We liked the Japanese restaurant the best. You just have to come with the understanding that their food is different than American food. It is prepared differently, etc. If you are an experienced scuba diver, this is not the best place for diving. We used the dive shop at the resort. The visibility is not what it is in other Caribbean places we have visited. It is also more expensive to dive here than other places we have visited. We did go on the Outback Safari excursion and loved it. That was the highlight of our trip. The guides are very knowledgable and friendly. If you are a first time visitor to the D.R., this excursion is a must. You don't know what you are missing by just staying at the resort and not seeing the D.R. countryside. We were totally shocked at how beautiful D.R. is (away from the beaches). They have a lot more vegetation than any other place we have visited in the Caribbean and the mountains in the background are breathtaking. Highly recommend you bring plenty of one dollar bills with you for tips. The D.R. people are so nice and they love to feel appreciated. We will definitely return to Iberostar Bavaro and the D.R. when we have children someday, so they can experience what a wonderful country the D.R. really is. It is the best kept secret in the Caribbean.

<Content>Great Week! We just got back from a week long vacation at the Bavaro 5/23-5/30. When we got there it was raining buckets so of course I was worried that it would rain all week (considering I checked the forecast before we left and it said rain all week!) We only got rain on Sunday and then it was totally sunny the rest of the week. The room they put us in originally, the air conditioning didn't work. I didn't want to feel like a pesky American who wanted their room to feel like an ice box, but when we woke up on Tuesday and it was warmer in our room than outside I knew there was something wrong. We had talked to the front desk 4 times and since we were at the pool the whole day we had no idea if someone came to look at it or not (but obviously not since it still didn't work). They moved us to another room, which was fine, and everything worked out great. We ate at 2 of the restaurants...the steak and Mexican. The steak restaurant was delicious and the Mexican was your basic Mexican fare. Nothing to rave about. The buffet was very plentiful although I would have to say that the food wasn't very good (why I gave it a 4 out of 5 rating), although it wouldn't make me not go back again. The made-to-order pasta was delicious, as I ate that ever night. There was plenty of fresh fruit which was delicious! I am a salad eater and was a bit confused as to the way they do their salad bar and lack of dressings! So, if you're a salad eater, bring your own dressing with because all they have is a chunky vinegrette that was very vinegary. Other than that, there were many things to choose from, and it was good, but nothing spectacular.The Star friends work very hard and are a lot of fun. The nightly entertainment was fun to watch. Be sure to bring lots of $1 bills with for tipping. Everyone works very hard and tipping them $1 here or there is very easy to do and so worth it. These people make very little money, approx. $100-150 U.S. a month. I bet we tipped over $125 the week we were there. They appriciate it so much and your beer or cocktail will be replaced with a new one before the first one is even gone...they take care of you :-)Over all, the resort was absolutely beautiful and the beaches were as well. We would defintely go back but there are so many other resorts out there that we'd love to go to. We went parasailing - totally worth it! It was so beautiful being able to see the mountains in the distance! Oh yeah, buy souveneirs at the Flea Market on the beach...it is so much fun haggeling with the Dominicans. They say you should pay about $12 for a $50 item. So, about 25% of what they tell you they want for the item. We bought t-shirts, a painting, knick-knacks, jewelry...all kinds of stuff and spent less than $150 on all of it! Also, note that you can only bring back 1 liter of alcohol per person...so don't buy too much rum!Enjoy your vacation there....it was wonderful...can't wait to go again!

<Content>Utopia. There are no words in the English dictionary to express the euphoria (not from the rum) that surrounds very aspect of this place. I dont know if it is even possible to ever top the overall experience we had at this place. We read every review on Tripadvisor and chose this place becasue of the positive reviews that we read on here. If there is an ounce of hesitation to book this place....dont hesitate. We crossed our fingers, and boarded a plane to the unknown and came back with quite possibly the best experience ever!There were four of us (two couples) and we flew out of Atlanta with Apple Vacations. If you havent used Apple before, they are a class act. They go out of their way to make sure you arrive comfortably and promt at your locations. They are informative and available at the hotel if you need anything. The flight was great. It was not a crop duster. Rather a relatively new plane (USA 3000). Movie and a meal in flight.HUMIDITYNow. Be prepared. We are from Alabama where it is humid in the summer. Not like this. We stepped off the plane and nearly choked. It took us about a day to get used to the humidity but plan on doing a lot of sweating.TRANSPORTATIONThe ride from the airport to the hotel was a breeze. There was an Apple Rep waiting on us when we arrived and even had our name on the checklist and the bus. The ride was pleasant and the bus was a brand new charter. Air conditioning. (which you will learn to appreciate). ROOMSThe rooms were comfortable. The air conditioning worked but there is a motion sensor in the room. When you leave...The air shuts off. We carried our own little fan and placed in the room to help keep it cool.STAFFThe Dominican people are the most friendly I have ever seen. Always smiling. And if you ever make eye contact, they will not hesitate to say, hola or try to make conversation. They are everywhere, all the time, waiting to serve you in some capacity. There is never a dull moment, and there is always a festive atmosphere surrounding this hotel. BEACHBring your snorkeling gear. There is coral 30 feet from the beach that runs endlessly. The fish are beautiful and the water is clear. The sand on the beach is like baby-powder. We go to Destin every year and the sand is much finer than that. There are Coconut, Palm trees everywhere on the beach. It is absolutely spectacular. FOODThe food was great. If you are a picky eater, you can definatley find what you like. We were hesitant because of some of the food reviews....but... I ate risky. I ate whatever they served and never got sick. There were a few minor bathroom emergencies from other guests.....(we wont name names) but that was all. There is plenty of bottled water available for you and the water they serve in the resturaunts is filtered. IMPORTANT LESSONS#1Bring Something top trade at the markets. Money is great...which you can bargain 25%-50% down easy...but they like hats, sunglasses and floats.....if you have a Sammy Sosa baseball card or two...that could help.#2 Play Blackjack. The dealers failed arithmatic. If you can count to 21..you will win a lot of money on the tables. The casino is small but not too busy.#3 Bug spray. Your room has tiny unkown insects. Nothing harmful, but a pleasant smelling bug spray will keep you feeling less itchy.#4 Bring many one dollar bills for tipping. Tip when they have done something to help you. Not every drink you recieve. Tipping is not expected. But they do appreciate it..and it will help things go smoothly...#5 Go snorkeling#6 Get at least one reservation at La BellenaIf you have any questions about this review email me. I will be happy to give you any advice on booking this amazing vacation.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever!!!!! I just got home from a week at the Iberostar Bavaro and I cannot rave about it enough! The beach, grounds and hotel are absolutely beautiful. The staff works really, really hard to keep the property immaculate and keep the guests happy and they succeed! I have never met more hardworking, pleasant and accomodating natives in my whole life. The Dominincans made the trip so special and memorable! The staff is so friendly and nice and they really make you feel special and they will do whatever they can to make you happy. Our maid was the same way. Our room was always cleaned to perfection. The staff in general are the sweetest people I've met. They are always up and they work so hard to make your vacation great. I wished i would've tipped more, but they don't even expect it...but they sure do deserve it! Bring lots of singles to tip, as you will see what I mean about how they deserve it!Most of the staff speaks enough English to get by, but I would highly suggest bringing a pocket English to Spanish dictionary to make things easier for all parties. I regret not having mine with me. Our room was big and nicely decorated. The beds were comfortable. I would ask for a second story room to keep the bugs at a minimum, even though for being so tropical, i was amazed at how few bugs i saw. they do a good job keeping them in check. i didnt even get one mosquito bite, but it's probably a good idea to bring some repellant anyway. if you forget, they sell it in the gift shop. the bathroom was great, all limestone and really big. They provide a blowdryer too and the outlets are the same as U.S. outlets so you don't need a converter. They also have an on-site doctor that my friend went to and she said they were very nice and helpful. It cost $60.00 US, but was well worth the peace of mind of not having to go off the property to get medical care if necessary. They have a pharmacy too where you can pretty much buy any RX medicine without a prescription.The food was plentiful. We were able to get reservations 5 nights out of 7 in the specialty restaurants, even though they only guarantee you 3 reservations for a 7 night stay. We went later, around 8:30-9:00 pm so we never had a problem. The Mediterranean was our favorite, superb seafood. The buffets were huge, not exactly gourmet, but very good nonetheless, you never were left feeling hungry...ever! We did not get sick once from the food or the water. We even brushed our teeth with the tap water, although i would not suggest swallowing any of it even though it is purified. They keep your room minibar well stocked with sodas and water, so getting refreshments was never a problem. They have a great midday beach party twice a week i think with music, punch, grilled shrimp and chicken kabobs, dancing, its really fun, i highly recommed going to it.There were minimal shops in the hotel so I would highly recommend venturing down to the local vendors on the beach. They have great stuff and it's pretty fun talking to them and getting to know them and bargaining with them. They love sunglasses, so if you have some extra pairs at home that you don't need or want, bring them with you so you can use them to barter for local goods. The rule of thumb is that you want to pay between 25-50% of the 1st price they give you. The prices in the hotel gift shops were very reasonable compared to some other islands i have been to. The beach was amazing! Perfectly colored turquoise water, crystal clear and sand as smooth as powder. Palm trees dot the beach. The water was the perfect temperature too, not too warm, but still a bit refreshing. The chairs and palapas fill up early so i would say get your towels out on your chairs to reserve the best spot by 9:00 or 9:30 the latest. NO One ever touches your stuff on the beach, i felt completely safe the whole time. Bring plenty of sunscreen--30 SPF minimum, because man it gets hot there!!!! you can catch a major burn in less than 20 minutes there! There are plenty activities to do during the day, volleyball, water aerobics, shooting, archery, the spa, the gym, you can be busy all day or just loubge around if you like. My only gripe would be that there weren't alot of singles or single activities to partake in, but that was ok, the staff will be more than happy to keep you occupied if you are feeling a little left out due to all the couples and families with kids (the staff loves American women!!!). The staff was great, i always felt 100% safe hanging out with them as well. This is definitely not a Singles Club Med atmosphere...But we had a blast nonetheless! I would highly recommend this resort and I personally can't wait to return! I hope to book again to return within a month or two!

<Content>Paradise! Just retuned from a fabulous week at the Iberostar Bavaro. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and the staff are all very friendly. We have been to 5 all-inclusive resorts - from Cuba, Mexico and DR - and found the grounds at the Bavaro to be the best yet!We dined at 5 different a-la-carte restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed each of them (our favourites being the japanese (Bavaro) and the chinese/thai (at the Dominicana)). Be sure to make your reservations the day of your arrival, or the following day. This will allow you the best choice of restaurants. At 3pm each day, you could make additional reservations for the a-la-carte. Realistically, you can eat at an a-la-carte restaurant each day of your stay.As far as the activities go, there was always plenty to do. The Star Friends were a great deal of fun, but not too pushy - if you wanted to sit back and relax, no problem.The beach - fantastic! Soft sand, playing beach volleyball was like playing on baby powder.A Tip - This resort is rather large. E-mail ahead and request a room close to the beach. I did so and we ended up beachfront - close to the pool. They could not guarantee that they could satifsy the request - but we ended up right on the beach when all of the others who came off our bus ended up near the lobby - so it seemed to work!Overall, a great vacation.

<Content>wished I could have stayed longer What an awesome week! The food, fun, sand and sun were only the beginning. The incredible friendliness of the staff really made the trip. I would definitely return and play a whole lot more beach volleyball! I know the staff never loses but we can always keep trying!!! A vacation to remember!

<Content>Fantastic Resort!! What an incredible week! This resort is absolutely beautiful, the lobby alone takes your breath away. The staff were always friendly, genuinely wanting to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The restaurants were all very well staffed, the service attentive and the food great. Not being a gourmet, I may not have the culinary experience to compare with, but I enjoy my meals tasty, well -cooked and delightfully presented, and was very satisfied with all restaurants that we tried. The beach is clean, the water turquoise green, and peacocks greet you each morning practically outside of your door! The resort offers numerous activities, with a good range for all age groups, or you can just stretch out on a comfy lounger and soak up the gorgeous sunshine!!

<Content>Don't waste your money! We just got back, and I wouldn't waste your time. The food was horrid! My wife and I spent more time in the bathroom then on the beach. I would never spend another vacation here. We will spend the extra money next time and go somewhere nice in the Caribbean. Moral of the story...don't be cheapskates! You'll pay for it! The animation team flirts with all the women, the place is infested with biting insects. And if you weren't from Canada, you got no respect.

<Content>Very nice resort! It is said that Iberostar Bavaro is a 5-star hotel, but their 5 star is really a 4 star in an international level...Beach: Beautiful.. white sandy beaches.. clear cool water.. (no trashes/cigarette buds)Spa: massages are at reasonable prices.. i'm not sure if that's what a swedish masage is.. but it is mostly rubbing ur body up and down.. not much of a massage... Hotel cleaniness: the people who work there are constantly cleaning.. VERY CLEANHotel environment: very natural.. with peacocks.. flamingos.. birds walking around.. ponds w/ fish in the main area .. the resort is rather large.. so wear comfortable sandals when going from places to places.. Activities: There is always something going on during the day and at night.. there are activities ranging from beach volleyball.. archery.. to merengue/salsa lessons.. at night is the show/casino/discoFood: was the only disappointment.. the food here was mediocre.. i guess i expected a 4 star hotel quality but i give the food a 3 star.. the best was the breakfast buffet where they served different kinds of juices.from papaya juice, watermelon, banana... etc.. if you eat frequently in japanese reestaurants.. do not try the japanese restaurant there because it isn't authentic at all! The best was the steakhouse or main buffet..Staff: the staff was amazing.. they always have smile on their face and they make sure you are being serviced/entertained. (they do not overly bug you.. u konw what i mean?)Souvenirs: I do not like to bargain much so I bought mine at the gift shop which was at reasonable prices.. you MUST bargain with street vendors.. they quote their prices at 100.. u woudl wanan say 30 so both can agree on 50.. i think street vendors are better if you buy in bulks.. Tips: not many ppl tip.. but the staff defiintely desreve tipps.. before going.. may i suggest to get 50-100 of singles depending on ur length of stay..

<Content>Great Hotel Resort We spent the first two weeks in May at the Iberostar Bavaro. Definately worth the money. Friendly staff and excellent food. I can't understand the people from Manchester who claimed the food was bad. Perhaps their stomachs are only used to chips and burgers or maybe they are trying to get a refund from their Tour Operator (English habit).I've eaten in many countries with many International tastes and flavours. This food rates with the best. We took several excursions and they are a little overrated. Definately not value for money. The country itself has little to offer as far as culture is concerned and the poverty is apparant everywhere. Better to stay on the Hotel Resort and enjoy the excellent facilities there. Our suite was clean and their were no musty smells. The room maids did a good job and it is worth tipping them for their work. The resort grounds are beautiful and well maintained. White sand beach is good. Take some swimming shoes because a few metres into the sea the bottom changes from sand to stones. We were satisfied with this hotel resort. In priciple we don't ever return to the same place for our vacation. We want to experience something different every time. We were so impressed with the Iberostar Bavaro that we would definately consider returning some day.

<Content>Greatest vacation ever!!! We just got back from Punta Cana on May 9. We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro. It was absolutely one of the best trips we have been on. I read all the reviews before we left and cannot believe the negavite responses. If you can't find anything to eat and enjoy it there is something wrong with you. The food was wounderful, the people were great. The resort was absolutely beautiful. The grounds were unbelieveable. The rooms were great, of course they were a little musty smelling, but what do you expect with the high humidity. The Star Friends were great and very entertaining. We went on the Outback Safari trip and we had a blast. Our guide and driver were the best. I could go on and on about the food, people, resort and everything else. The only thing I would have to say about it is all the topless. It was everywhere on the beach. I was glad they did not allow it up at the pool. Of course most of it should be covered up. Most of it is not pretty. You get used to it after a while. It's just part of all the different cultures. Again this was the best trip we have ever taken and would go back in a heart beat.

<Content>My best vacation ever!! We just returned on May 7th. My wife and I had the best vacation yet. After reading some reviews we had some concern. However, we were so pleased we went. The Iberostar is absolutely beautiful. The people who work there are even better!! They work their tails off to make your vacation enjoyable. I was so impressed. I am not sure how someone can actually give the Iberostar less than a 4 or 5 rating. Yes, the rooms are musty. Well it is 90 degress with 90 percent humidity. What do you expect? So you see a bug or two. Again what do you expect in that climate. If I had to pick one bad thing it was that the air condition would shut off each time you leave the room, and then turn back on as soon you enter. BUT..the great things FAR outweighed the little things. ..and the food and drinks were great. If you have any problems contact the front desk and they will take care of it right away. I can not say enough about the Star Friends and all the employees. What great people. It really made me appreciate the life we have here in the U.S.I would go back to the Iberostar in a heartbeat.

<Content>Can't wait to return! Returned last night (May 10) from a fabulous week! The Dominican people must be the friendliest, hardest working people around. My husband and I have traveled to many Caribbean islands and the DR is now one of our favorites. The grounds were immaculate, room was very nice, and the food was great. We ate at the specialty restaurants 5 nights and the buffet 2. Our favorite was the Meditteranean. The beach is gorgeous. The whole atmosphere of the resort is relaxed - no problem getting beach chairs, reservations for dinner or tables at any buffet. We loved the international flavor and met people from all over the world. The only negative was having to come home to the real world again!

<Content>Best time of my life. I just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro resort on May 7th. I stayed a week but it definelty wasn't long enough. From the minute I got off the bus and had my welcome drink, to looking at the resort from the bus window on my way back to the airport. I had the best time of my life. All i can say is you have to give this place a try. I am going to make this place my once a year vacation. One week or two i will make sure i get there at least once a year. There was never a dull moment. The staff was amazing to start. The resort was spotless and very well maintained. I can't believe how friendly everybody was,Hola I can't count how many times i said this. Very friendly. The food was amazing, especially the buffets. The best part was the drinks. Ron and Lemonade, you have to give this a try. I coudn't get enough of these. The activities where great to keep busy all day long, the beaches i can' t explain how amazing they are. i don't think i can write enough about this place you have to give it a try. They have a great disco aswell. I was there every night. I can't say i can dance so well but the atmosphere was soo good. you will meet many amazing ppl and have the time of your life. Hope you all give it a try and see you there!!

<Content>Goods and Bads - A Fair Review  Rooms are very nice and spacious and cleaned well everyday. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The beach is superb and the water is crystal clear. Be aware that most people on the beach are topless - a large amount of Europeans. I was most disappointed with the food. It is edible but not all that tasteful. I went with a party of 11 and 4 were sick (one terribly for 4 days with 103 fever and needed an IV). This is a poor country and you get what you pay for. If you get a deal its because the quality of food is not that high. Make sure you tell the chefs to make your food well done b/c most of the time the food was undercooked. The Steak House was the best place to eat. We spoke to the employees there and they only make $40 US every two weeks and work 14-15 hours a day so if you think you are getting a good deal think about how much the hotel is really making paying its employees those amounts and serving, in my opinion, less than 5 star food. There is always something to eat but after 7 days I was tired of burgers and fries. All the staff are very friendly and it definately helps to speak Spanish. To the right of the hotel on the beach are shops where you can buy cigars and other goods. Negotiate with these people b/c I paid $50 for a box of cigars that they wanted $120 for when I first got there. Go with an open mind, dont expect gourmet food, and you wont be disappointed. We had an average time but will not be going back. Important - to reserve chairs on the beach give one of the employees $20 and he'll get them for you every morning for the whole week at 5am.

<Content>Don't mind those finniky be grudgers!!! This is a piece of heaven....Anyone who has had a bad experience was very unlucky or expected too much from this beautiful country.. I have also read all the reviews...I can understand some peoples concerns (eg musty room etc - the place has 95% humidity!!!) but that is nothing compaired to the beautiful rooms, high standard of hygiene  housekeeping, excellent food  variety (especially fish lovers!), friendliness of staff, beautiful beach, wonderful shows....it would be even worth the travelling for a weeks stay!! It may not have the 5 star level of service that many American visitors would expect from The Four Seasons, but this is definitely a 5 star resort!!!!We centrainly enjoyed our very relaxing honeymoon - we just can't wait to return - next time we will take it easy on the Rum!ps Take the country safari adventure - bring some copy books for the school kids - the Catamarn trip was OK, but the other 100 times better!!

<Content>Time of my life!!!! Having not traveled much in my life, I was a little worried about traveling to Punta Cana and staying at the Iberostar Bavaro., I read all the reviews, the good and the bad, and wasn't quite sure what I would walking into. I am so glad that I went. The Iberostar Bavaro is absolutely beautiful. The grounds, the pool, the beach and the people, ... I cannot say enough about the people who work at this resort. I have never stayed at any place where even the groundskeepers say Hola as you pass them on the walk way. All the employees including the Star Friends work hard all day everyday., and with a smile. If they aren't smiling they are singing... How can that not put a smile on your face? Special thanks to Johnny the manager, and to our favorites... Miguel, Leonardo, Lorenzo, Santa, and Diny!!!! This place is the best... Cannot wait to go back again. Make sure you keep your eye on the look out for James Bond... Applause, Applause, Applause... Shupa!

<Content>Oh My Gawd!!!!!!!!!! It was great!!!!!!!!!!  Olah!!!!We were a group of 18  wow! we had an awesome time. The resort is just beautiful, the food fabulous,  the people are so friendly. The only issue that we had was they had no rye whiskey like CC or Crown Royal , most of our group drink that , so that was a little disappointing especially when they list they have international you would assume they would carry rye. The weather was perfect, rained only at night  the beach is the nicest I have ever seen in the Caribbean ( I have been at many )  the others could not compare. We would definetly make that trip again to Punta Cana ,  the Iberostar will be the spot we will look into too, if you are looking for a all around fabulous resort don't hesitate , choose this one!!! We were there for the week of April 24th, 2004. Adios!!

<Content>No Complaints I checked out the reviews before booking the trip. I saw complaints about various things, but my I and my wife along with some friends decided to go. The people were great, the food was good, and the europeans for the most parts were good. We made an effort to speak Spanish,as little as we know ,and the locals loved it. The europeans were a little crude at times, but if you mingle with them they can be alot of fun. Don't judge all by a few pigs.The hotel and grounds were well maintained. We are planning to go back with our kids in the fall.A word of caution with younger kids, the beaches have alot of topless sunbathing so it may not be your thing. We enjoyed it!!!

<Content>Don't waste your money, go somewhere else!!! I stayed at the Bavaro for 2 weeks between the 14th April and the 27th April. A week would have been enough!It is a beautiful place and the staff seem nice but you do seem to notice that they like to say their little peice to you and don't really care how you actually feel or what you want.The best bit is the beach, amazing but if you want to sit in the shade you do need to go down at 6:30am because everybody is fighting to get shade, not just the europeans, most where American.DO NOT USE THE BANK!!!!! The male clerk is a theif and made an attempt to steal $50 dollas from us by making up an exchange rate of 53 Pesos to the Dollar and claiming it was for the banks commission. We realised we where short in our money when we left so got our Pesos back and went to reception who checked with the bank clerk said he made a mistake and should have charged us only 45 Pesos to the Dollar. This was not that case in the bank. He told us the exchange rate was 45 but the rest was for commission! We wanted the police to be called but the hotel would do NOTHING about it. When I told the girl on Guest relations she told me she didn't understand the word complain!!! This is still ongoing and I want something done about it.DO NOT USE THE SHOP NEXT TO THE BANK! They the also theives! I bought a pot in there that they charged me $20 for, in the gift shop it was $3!!! I went in the next day to buy something else and told them they where trying to charge me too much and they laughed in my face. They are the most expensive shop in the area and they make every attempt to rip you off. If you go there, make sure you go to the gift shop first and price things up.The food is awful! Unless you like sea food then don't even bother! Yes there are so many resturaunts, the ones in the other hotels (mexican, tropical, star rock cafe) you just CAN'T book in because they are always fully booked, unless you book 9 days in advance! The resturaunts in the Bavaro, 3 out of the 4 of them where fish so we eat at the steakhouse every night which after 2 weeks gets you down a little especially when you've paid for it already. I couldn't eat in the buffet because it made me so ill. For the last few days we eat chocolate from the shop because we just couldn't eat the hotel food. I am still ill now and my husband was very ill in the first week.On my birthday they baked me a cake with my name on it and sent me flowers (at a price) but when my husband ordered Champagne before hand for the table as a suprise (not the stuff you get free either) they served it to the wrong table then made us wait at least 40 minutes for another bottle while they ran round the hotel finding one.If your a couple, there are far too many children and there is no-where to go to get away from kids. There should be an adult only area but there is nothing. Your not even safe in the nightclub!If you've booked already, make the most of it but if your going to book my advise would be don't! I compare all my holidays to Royal Caribbean Cruises where we go every year, compared to that this holiday was only a 3*. Even at the airport it was awful. Our transfer didn't turn up so we where late checking in. They tried to charge us to get our bags on the plane and if we wanted to sit together we had to pay extra. I wasn't sat with my husband on the way home. I paid over 拢2000 and wasn't even sat together. No-one was because no-one would pay the stupid 'cheapy cheapy' price the airport staff where trying to get out of us! I sat on the plane and cried. I had wasted 12 days of my holiday allowence and 拢2000 to be stolen from, to be sick and to sit alone on a plane! I couldn't wait to be home and even back to work!

<Content>Loved Iberostar Punta Cana We took an Apple Vacation tour to Punta Cana. Everything went very smoothly from the time we arrived at the airport on through our entire vacation. We loved the Iberostar Punta Cana. The grounds were beautiful. The food was very good and there was plenty to pick from. The beach and water were beautiful. We snorkeled right off the beach and the amount of different fish we saw were amazing. The Apple reps, Ellen and Carlos were great! We went onthe Marinarium Snokeling trip which was great. If you get a chance and want to learn about the country, take the Outback Safari Tour. We learned a lot about the country and people and had a lot of fun during the tour. The Dominicans are very friendly and happy people. I would definitely recommend this trip to my friends.

<Content>Fantastic family vacation We vacationed at Iberostar Bavaro April 17 through 24 with my wife and two daughters, ages 14 and 18. Everyone had a ball! I read all 96 TripAdvisor reviews (not all at once!) that were posted prior to leaving and was a little concerned about the few negative reviews since I've not visited The Dominican Republic before or vacationed via an all-inclusive package. Our vacations in the past included concierge level accomodations and dining at Disney's five star resorts and restaurants as well as The Atlantis on Paradise Island, just to give you an idea.My own quickie reviews to go along with the other TripAdvisor users' comments: ROOMS (2): Very attractive, clean, slight musty smell - we brought an air freshener but used it only a couple times, bar well stocked, air conditioning worked fine, remember to ask for your TV remotes and safe rentals when you check in. FOOD/MEALS: Very good, no one got sick although we came prepared, Buffets were outstanding - they have everything, For breakfast I preferred waiting until 10am for the smaller buffet located next to the pool - I enjoyed the slower paced morning atmosphere better and the selection was quite good there as well, the afternoon beach party food was also excellent especially given the sangria and merengue dancing the accompanied it. SPECIALTY RESTAURANTS: Mediterranean (we all had seafood), Gourmet (large lobsters), and Japanese (fish, beef, chicken) restaurants all above average, all air conditioned, lot of fun interacting with the help. DRINK: They had every kind of frozen cocktail drink as well as the standards like martinis and brandy, I avoided the beer and wine the first few days given the TripAdvisor reviews I previously read and was pleasantly surprised when I did try the beer, El Presidente cervera is not too bad and they always served it ice cold, the beer stocked in the room refrigerators is different and packs a punch!, the wine is not great but it doesn't taste like vinegar as one reviewer claimed - I drank both the blanco and rojo several times during the week at dinner. ACTIVITIES: We did not partake of any of the offsite trips - you don't have to!, StarFriends worked hard from 10:30am until the disco closed (or, at least, until we left around 12:30 or 1am the next morning) to keep you entertained, my daughters' team even won the Olimpic Games one day and they appeared in two dance numbers in full outfits during the evening show, I took a Spanish lesson, we parasailed, other activities too numerous to mention although we never felt pressured to participate - most days my wife and I crashed at the beach. VISITORS: We really enjoyed meeting visiting guests from around the globe, we were able to communicate with visitors from Chili, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, etc despite the language barrier (body language and facial expressions go a long way). there was no anti-USA hostility that I noted but I wasn't wearing any USA USA or American Fries tee-shirts either. AIRPORT: I thought it was very attractive, we did not encouter any problems or confusion, we did loose a piece of luggage filled with suntan lotion and toiletries that are probably now available on the black market, guess I should not have checked the bag but rather carry it on the plane.The most enjoyable aspect of the vacation was interacting with the Dominican people. I've never met such genuinely pleasant people who are so hard working. One of the StarFriends I spoke with was finishing a 40 day work period by leaving for a four day break to his home three and one-half hours away after he gets out of the disco in the early moring. The best TripAdvisor reviewer comment I read was to obtain 100 single dollar bills at the bank before leaving for vacation. Leave a dollar tip ($5 at the restaurants and for the maids) for these hard working people. It means so much to them and is so little to us. Ninety percent of the vacationers during my stay didn't tip. I understand the packaged stays are all-inclusive, but what's a dollar? I'm sure another reason is that most do not come prepared with a lot of small bills to leave for tipping. (You can't get cash advances in US dollars, only pesos.) So come prepared! Not only to tip,; but to relax, party, laugh, drink, and eat!

<Content>Honeymoon in Dominican - If you are looking for a reasonably priced vacation, that isn't extravagant but you will have fun.. Iberostar is a good choice.We had our honeymoon in Punta Cana last September. It was sponsored by Apple vacations - and was an all inclusive deal. Apple has a great accomodation plan that includes tips on what to expect in the area in terms of people and things to do - the staff was very friendly and extremely! helpful.I was a bit disappointed in our room at the Iberostar when we first got there, it was their off season and they gave us a room w/a view of .. nothing. They set us up in a nice room in front of the pool the next day w/out any hassles.I have been to Mexico and the one noticeable difference to me was the people - Dominican people were FRIENDLY!, grateful for our tourism, tried to communicate with us and made it very enjoyable.. In Mexico, they were not at all friendly at the resort we stayed and the language barrier was bad- we couldn't find anyone speaking English to help us out despite the travel agents right on site.My husband LOVED the Dominican food. Iberostar resorts do have some great restaurants. We also went horsebackriding right on the beach, despite the warning of apple vaca's. That was awesome. Went kayaking, swam w/the nurse sharks, (great tour) snorkel cruise, etc., tried to take another tour but the road was blocked due to some political unrest - it was quite an experience.We were told that February/March is the best time to go as it is not humid.We would go back but probably stay at the Iberostar Bavaro which caters to couples/honeymooners.

<Content>Loved Punta Cana I visited Punta Cana 4/12/04-4/16/04 with 2 of my good friends and we loved it. The people were very friendly and helpful. The food was okay but the drinks were very good. Grounds were well kept and the beach was fantastic. We even left the resort and went to club Mangu and partied with other tourist and the locals. Me and girlfriends can't wait to go back.

<Content>Great time at Iberostar Bavaro We just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana on an apple vacation. We are a family of 5, kids ages 18, 16 and 8. The older kids both took friends. The kids all think this was the best vacation ever! There were many wonderful aspects of the vacation. First the Iberostar Bavaro was wonderful, the staff could not do enough for you. We followed suggestions here and left tips on the pillows for the maids and had wonderful service. We tipped the bartenders and I have seldom seen people happier to recieve a dollar, it was more like you had given them a twenty or a fifty. The buffets were very good, in fact we enjoyed them more than the specialty restaurants. We went to the Steak restaurant. The steak had very good flavor but it Dominican beef which is different than American. If you accept that you will be fine. We also went to the Mediterranean, the fish was overcooked and overall it was unimpressive. We were going to go to the Japanese but we all decided we would rather eat at the buffet, it was always very good and gave enough varieties that my whole family was happy. Be sure to go to the pool on Thursday, they had a cook out with at least 1.5 pound lobsters! The buffet had very small Lobsters on Wednesday night but they were very tasty and you could take as many as you wanted.Well enough about food. We went on three excursions Outback Safari, Manatarium, and Punta Cana golf club. The outback safari and the manatarium were great trips as previously described here. I would definitely do the manatarium in the afternoon since they have a happy hour after swimming with the sharks. I talked to others who did the dolphin swim and they enjoyed this also. I looked for information on Punta Cana golf on this site prior to going and found very little so I will write more on this. We went to the Punta cana golf club because the pictures of it along the ocean looked the best and it was still only 30 min. from our hotel. We were picked up in a minivan and drove at least 70 mph on roads better suited to 35. Given this we were regularly passed by others. Driving in the dominican is not for the faint of heart. The club house was spetacular but be sure to take golf balls with you as the charge 15-20 dollars US for a sleeve of 3 balls, take tees too. The rental equipment at Punta cana golf club was not Callaway as advertised. The clubs were basic junk but since there was 3 of us renting we did have one decent old big bertha driver (the others were wood 'Lasers 2'). The course had a variety of tees so it can be challenging to all levels. The layout was fun and we enjoyed playing it. Many holes are on the water literally. I walked off the fairway 10 yards on the 17th hole and pulled my ball from the ocean, it was quite beautiful. Beverages and food are very expensive on the course and the drink cart never came around on the back nine so fill up on the front! It was still a positive experience as long as you are not too serious about how you do if you are using the rentals. Cost was around $115 US/per person and $30 US/ per person club rental. My son and his friend did really enjoy the course and overall it was a very positive experience. In my group only my 8 year old got sick and this was only once and for one night only. We pretty much ate everything especially the ice cream on the beach. Nobody in our group wanted to come home so I guess that means it was a wonderful place to go. Terry

<Content>Somewhat disappointed Just returned from Punta Cana this afternoon and stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro April 9 - 16th. Overall it was a great vacation because it came at a time when it was desperately needed, however, my husband and I both agree that we would not return to this resort. We stayed at a Riu resort in Playa Del Carmen last spring break that was a class down, so I'm comparing the Iberostar Bavaro to the Riu Playacar, even though it's not quite apples for apples. I'm also basing this on the other resorts we've stayed at in Mexico and Brasil. From the Apple brochure, I was under the impression that the Iberostar Bavaro was a 5 star, the best of the Iberostar resorts in Punta Cana. As we have traveled to foreign countries before, I know that a foreign 5 star/apple is not the same by American standards and that's fine. I got a bad taste in my mouth from the moment we checked in. As per my AAA/Apple arrangements, we are a family of 5 and were supposed to have 2 rooms - one with a king bed for my husband and I, and the other was to be a connecting room with 2 double beds and a sleeper sofa. At first they tried to give us rooms that weren't even close together, in different buildings even. We refused and explained to them that we have children and need to be together. Then they tried to give us one room upstairs, and the other ground level. Again we refused. After being told that it was our only option, we finally settled on 2 rooms next to each other, that all had double beds. I'm pretty open minded and flexible, but when you're told that your accomodations would be one thing and they give you something totally different, frustration sets in. We were on a family vacation and it's hard enough to keep track of kids when they are right next to you, let alone in a different building or different floor. When you have a king bed at home, you don't want to cram into a double. (Which by the way, sure seemed like a small double) The hotel check-in girl told us that all of the king beds were on one side of the resort and the doubles on the other side, hence our not getting the rooms we were expecting. She also told us that there were no connecting rooms. After some friends with teenagers checked in 3 days later and had to get 2 rooms at opposite ends of the resort we knew there was a problem. Basically we were lied to at check-in because the king side of the hotel DID have doubles. The morning before we left for home, the general manager was casually walking through the breakfast buffet area, talking to patrons and asking for their opinions. After expressing my disappointment about the room situation, he did offer to try to find us new rooms, but with only one night left, I didn't want to bother. He explained that the hotel was at 100% capacity and that unfortunately, sometimes they do have the problem with room arrangements. He said that when the resort was built 10 years ago it was geared towards the Europeans, and double beds were what they wanted. He went on to explain that the hotel does have a contract with the Thomas Cook group from Germany, and therefore, the Germans get the better rooms, beachfront and accomodation wise, because they pay more. (yes, there ARE a few connecting rooms, but the Germans get them) I asked him what percentage of their business was European/American. He said that 50% were Americans, about 25% German and the rest other nationalities. He said that due to that fact, they were building 50-60 new units to accomodate the American family market. With the 100% capacity, we also found several other problems. One being that the beach was dirty. By that I mean trash - cigarette butts, straws/drink stirrers, plastic cups, empty bottles of water, etc. There was also a MAJOR problem with the beach and pool chairs. There were not nearly enough of them for the hotel capacity. If you did not get out by 5:30 AM to reserve a beach hut, you didn't get one. If you did not get out by 7 -7:30 AM to get a hut by the pool, you did not get one. And if you weren't at either place by 8 - 8:30 AM to reserve just beach chairs, you didn't get any! And I am not kidding, people were up that early to get the spot they wanted. The day we arrived, which was about 11 AM, we could not find empty chairs until after 4 o'clock. Although the grounds were very beautiful, we were also disappointed in the trash that was laying around. People would leave their coffee cups/drink glasses laying outside their rooms, along the walkways, and it would be there for 24 hours! And again, a lot of cigarette butts, but blame that on the inconsiderate people who throw them on the ground. A few positive remarks and information about the hotel. The hotel does provide beach towels through a card service, but the towel shack doesn't open until 8 AM. So when you turn your towels in at the end of the day, rather than get your towel card back, get fresh towels, and that way you have them for the next morning. The pool allows rafts/floats of all type and size, so you can bring them from home, or buy them at the gift shops or flea market. The rooms have a shampoo and bath gel dispenser in the shower and there is also a hair dryer in the bathroom. If you're used to a high powered one though, bring your own. There is also a safe in the room which has an electronic code, so there is no key to keep track of. There is no clock anywhere, so bring a small battery operated portable clock if you don't wear a watch. You have to make dinner reservations for a specific time slot at many of the restaurants, but you'd have no way of knowing the time if not for the clock or watch. I would also recommend bringing walkie talkies to keep in touch as most cell phones did not work down there, and the reosrt is pretty expansive. They did offer windsurfing, Hobie cats and Kayaking at the resort, but book as soon as you arrive. Again due to the fact that the resort was at 100% capacity, you had to wait 3 days for a Hobie. There were no jet ski rentals at the resort and there was nothing outside of the hotel. No town to explore. No restaurants, grocery store, no shopping. There was a pretty good selection of items at the resort gift shop, and on Carribean Street, (which is a small row of various shops on the hotel property) but you could not barter for cheaper prices like you could at the flea market on the beach. I recommend checking out the gift shops on property first to get an idea of what things cost because the vendors on the beach don't have prices on anything, and therefore, you have no idea of what things should cost. Offer the vendor about 1/2 of his first offer. They do take U.S. dollars or Dominican pesos. We did the Outback Jungle Safari tour, and it was GREAT! That was the best thing about the whole trip. The tour stops at a typical Domincan home, an elementary school, a cocoa farm, and at a beach to go boogie boarding. Just to drive by and see the countryside, sugarcane fields, mountains, small villages and people was awesome. The Dominican people seem to be very happy with the small amount of tangible/material things that they have. It is a country with an abundance of natural beauty. (If you plan on taking the Jungle tour, bring pens, pencils, crayons, paper etc., from home if possible to donate to the schools. They are truly poverty stricken and could greatly use any supplies) Overall, it was a good vacation and I think the problems and disapointments we encountered were because of the 100% capacity. I think if you go at any other time, you will find the resort to be wonderful.

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful Experience Just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro, Punta Cana. What a gret experience. Before going, I must have read about 50 or so reviews. Many of them positive and some were negative. Hard to beleive because I gave the resort a 10. We went the last week of March. The weather was not as great as I would have liked but still had lots of sun. We got periods of rain almost every day. We were told that it was unusual for them to get that much. But back in the States they were getting drenched along the east coast and we probably got some of that. But it was still hot and sunny for the most of our vacation. The beach has to be the most beautiful beach I have ever walked on. You can walk for miles and miles in either direction from the resort and I can almost guarantee that you wont step on a stone or shell. You wont even see one. The sand is like soft powder and is a pleasure to walk on. We did some snorkeling in front of the resort. The water was a little rough but we still saw plenty of fish. If you really want to see fish, bring a snack of crackers or bread while you are swimming and they will swarm you. It's really a neat experience. We didn't do any excursions because we were happy just being there on the beach. Never had a problem getting one of those umbrellas on the beach. Some reviews said you had to get there at 7am to get one. We went anytime from 9 to 11 and there were plenty. The nice thing about the Bavaro is that the two hotels next to it are part of the Iberostar resorts. The Dominicana and the Punta Cana. They are 4 star resorts and you can use any of their facilities, restaurants, bars, etc, but they can't use yours because the Bavaro is a 5 star. It was cool to go from one resort to the next and get a drink at their bars and listen to the music. The resorts are real close to each other and you will see how much nicer the Bavaro is compared to the 4 star resorts. We never had a problem finding seating at the Bavaro for any of the meals. We went to the Punta Cana for lunch one day and couldn't find a place to sit. Their facilities is much smaller. Lets talk about the rooms. Didnt notice any odors or mustiness at all. We did smell it once we got home. Had to wash everything. They use a strong deodorizer in the rooms and it hides any mustiness so we were real comfortable. They keep your mini fridge stocked with soda, drinking water, and beer. They also supply jugs of water so you can brush your teeth and for drinking. The people who work there are some of the hardest working people I have ever met. They don't speak much english but we never found that to be a problem. Don't forget. You are in their country so try to be patient if you cant get someone to understand your request. Learn a few basic words in Spanish. I think I used the word, cervaise, quite a bit. That's beer. They have Presidente beer and it is OH so good. They go over and beyond to make sure you are comfortable. Your wine and water glasses will be full at all times. The water used for drinks, ice cubes and in the restaurants is all purified. We ate at the Mexican and Gourmet restaurants. They were both great. Hint. Make your reservations for your restaurants as soon as you get there. We made them before we even went to our room (Saturday)and we couldnt get into the Mexican restaurant until the following Friday. Unless we wanted to eat at 9:30 at night. Many of the reviews stated that the beef is not that great. And I have to agree with that. A bit tough. Until I went to the Mexican restaurant and had the flattened steak. Tendorized and an awesome flavor. Washed it down with a Carona which was a nice way to end the week. If you can't enjoy your stay here, then I can't imagine you enjoying yourself anywhere. Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Truly Paradise! We had the time of our lives! There is not one negative comment to be made. The food was delicious and there is something for everyone. If you can't find something to please you, you can't be pleased. The drinks are good and plentiful. The beach is absolutely the most beautiful beach I've ever seen. Be sure to get out to the beach or pool early to reserve your chair. The sun is very hot there so be sure to get one of the palapas for shade, you will need it. We took our own beach towels so we could mark our chairs and find them easily. The staff can't do enough for you. If you do encounter any problems, call the front desk immediately and they will take care of things for you. The language barrier was no problem...they eventually figured out what we needed and it gave us plenty to laugh about. There were four of us travelling together (all in our forties) and none of us got sick. We ate everything and drank every drink they offered. We did not use the water to brush our teeth, we used the bottled water just to be safe. If you are looking for the perfect vacation....this is the place to go! Good luck and have fun!!!!!!

<Content>Great Time! My husband and I returned on 040804. We had a wonderful, relaxing vacation. I was worried about the food based on previous reviews, but it was fine, we really liked the Mexican and Steakhouse Restaraunts. The resort and beach are were very beautiful and clean. We didnt go down early to reserve a chair each morning. We got down to the pool and the beach on two different days around 9-9:30 and we had no problem getting chairs. We even got a hut at the pool. We took an excursion thru Apple Vacations to Saona Island. This was an all day trip but well worth it! We also shopped the Flea Markets on the beach, but you do have to negotiate price. The nightly shows were good too. There was something to do everyday. We would defenitly return. Don't worry about packing too many clothes as we stayed in our swimming suits for a majority of the day and only changed at night when we had a reservation for dinner.

<Content>Great Vacation We just returned from a week's vacation at Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana. What a great place. The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are nice - did see one BIG bug, though. Also, had a sewage problem one evening, but was fixed by the time we returned from dinner. All of the staff was very friendly despite the language barrier. The food was good, lots of variety. The pasta bar in the main buffet is just delicious - they cook your pasta dish any way you like right there in front of you. Not much variety in shopping. Some of the things for sale in the shops on the beach are more expensive than in the hotel gift shop and the people in the beach shops don't give up easily. The beach was beautiful, the pool was nice, but the pool at the Iberostar Dominicana is better (a little bigger). We went there to swim one day. We took the Outback Safari excursion. I would highly recommend that! We got to go out and see the country, visit a Dominican home and go up in the mountains and end the tour by boogie boarding at a beach on the east cost. It was well worth the money and just a great time! We had (3) 6year olds and even they enjoyed it. The swimming with the dolphins at Manati Park was ok. A little expensive, though, and you're only in the water with the dolphins for less than 5 minutes. It wasn't what we (the adults) expected, but the kids loved it. All in all, we had a great vacation and the resort is just gorgeous. We hated to leave.

<Content>One time trip I just got back on 4/9/04 for a five night stay. This is the deal. Had a great time, met good people, but would not return. Food was good, not great, but I did not get sick. Lots of Europeans, but did not find them as bad as I heard on earlier reviews. The only bad thing I could say was that the rooms were average at best. There were ants in the room and they were tiny, so if you think you didn't see any they were there. Beds were uncomfortable and small. I had a family of four and I did not have proper sleeping arrangements. Also the mini bar refrigerator did not stay cold, so if you have formula or milk your out of luck. I would say overall that I had a great time, weather was beautiful and service was good. I would have stayed longer if I could, five nights was not long enough.

<Content>Fantastic!!!! We just got back from the Iberostar Punta Cana last night, 4/8/04, and it was absolutely fantastic. I traveled with 4 adults and 4 children whose ages are 3, 8, 9, and 14. Before I left, I had checked the reviews and was very nervous reading all the negativity. I was pleasantly surprised. The resort was beautiful, the staff was extremely courteous and accommodating, the beach was gorgeous and the fun was pleantiful. What I enjoyed most was the entertainment group. They really try to get everyone involved in dancing and games all day long at the pool and beach. It was like a week long beach party! Only 2 of us had a little stomach upset but nothing that imodium couldn't handle. My only complaints are that the Europian Guests were extremely rude and you must, must, must, get to the beach or poolside by no later than 8:00 am to reserve a chair or hut (I brought my own beach towels so it was easy to reserve our seats). So if you are on your way to Iberostar Punta Cana, get ready to have a great time.

<Content>Great Experience Indeed! Enjoyed the Iberostar Punta Cana from March 31st to April 7th. And then I couldn't wait to get off the plane ride home and tell you all that the iberostar punta cana is a wonderful place to visit. The food was very good, the service was extraordinary, it was very clean, the people were friendly and none of us (7) got sick at all. (I even brushed my teeth with the tap water and drank the warm milk in my espresso.) Four of us did eat yogurt daily for two weeks prior to leaving, but I can't say if that made a difference or not...couldn't hurt. I highly recommend the outback safari excursion and the mexican restaurant in the hotel. I found some of the shows to be very entertaining and some to be horrific, but everyone has different tastes in this regard. And you can always walk to the other Iberostar on a night your night being entertained to your liking. Beach was beautiful, and the shops down the beach were a fun distraction. My one word of caution pertains to Jet skiing. There are no jet skis available at the beach (a couple of accidents prompted the government to ban them, I was told) But they do sell off property excursions for Jet skiing....Don't! We wasted 4 hours of our day and never did Jet ski, but we did feel as if we were involved in some illicit activity making the deal. So, overall a really swell place. Oh yeah,The drinks were strong enough and you can always say mas. Enjoy! feel free to e-mail any questions.

<Content>The Best Family Resort Around For a family resort this one is TOP-NOTCH!!! We just came back from one week March 28 - April 4, 2004 WITHOUT our kids. If we are vacationing without kids we normally go to an adults only resort, but this time we thought we would give this resort a try. It is definately family oriented and there were a lot of kids, which in no way interfered with our enjoyment, but seeing so many kids having a wonderful time made us yearn for our own. For that reason only, the next time we would go to an adults only resort, but if we were to travel with our kids, we would definately return to the Iberostar Bavaro. There is nothing bad that I can say about this resort. The grounds and the beach are absolutely beautiful - very lush and enough umbrellas and chairs for everyone plus extras. The beach I would say was comparible to Negril Jamaica - long, white and soft. The rooms were large, gorgeous and impecably clean! The food was awesome, although we don't recommend the Mexican only because it wasn't the style of mexican that we are accustomed to. We love fish and seafood and we actually had too much shrimp, lobster and fish to last us a while. If you are meat eaters or vegetarians, there is so much wonderful delicious options that you won't be hungry for even a minute!!! The breakfasts were terrific!!! But don't waste your money on the beach massages as they are mere rubdowns, with no serious massage benefits - very disappointing! We truly recommend this resort. We walked the beach and visited the surrounding resorts, and the only ones we found comparible are the Riu Palace Maceo, Riu Bambu and the Princess Bavaro. All the other hotels were no where on par with the Iberostar Bavaro. This is truly a 5 star caribean resort, and trust me we are accustomed to staying at some of the best resorts in the caribean. If you want to save some money, feel confident staying at the Iberostar Dominicana or Iberostar Punta Cana. They are all a part of the same resort, share the same grounds and many of the same restaurants. You walk freely between the three and from what I could tell, the rooms although not as large were still very very nice. Although we were only allowed 3 a la cartes per week, we ate a la carte all 7 nights. If the restaurants have room, they will take you, and it doesn't hurt to slip the matred a couple of bucks in appreciation. The only downfall was that apparently they are experiencing unusually rainy weather lately. We had only 2 days of full sun, 2 days of full rain, and the rest was mixed. It had apparently been this way the week before, and the forecast predicted more of the same for the following week. All in all, you won't be sorry that you visited this resort!!!! We will definately return to this resort - with the kids next time! Go there with confidence and ENJOY!!!!!

<Content>great beach/grounds - bad rooms/dirty pool stayed at iberostar bavaro march 18-25 ,2004 and got ripped off. I paid premium price to funjet vacations for room with 2 queen beds and got a room with 1queen bed and a mattress on floor. I spoke to the funjet rep ( VIP) about this problem and got no help. the best rooms at this resort are only available to the thomas cook euro group. rooms smell musty and need renovation. pool was extremly dirty and small. Food at buffet and specialty restaurants was ok . resort maids, bartenders,restaurant staff very friendly. Dont miss nightly Star Friends show. The beach is the best I ever saw -beautiful sand and clear blue water. dont use tap water or you will get sick , only use bottled water to drink and brush teeth. Many European tourists at this resort, so just ignore the jerks. Many overweight topless euro woman and men in thongs. I spent the first 2 days of my trip trying to resolve problems. FUNJET rates this resort 5 1/2 stars, try 3 stars . Buyer beware this resort is not worth the additional expense.

<Content>A week in paradise Been searching for the perfect beach for many years. WE FOUND IT. Crystal clear water, wide-white, clean sand. Food varied each day, beautiful presentation and EXCELLENT. Large room looking out to lush tropical gardens, beautifully maintained. Impossible to walk the whole beach--it went on for miles. The Dominicans are extremely friendly and love it when you, at least, try to speak Spanish. Fun all-day trip was the jeep safari. For those who want an adventure. Everything was top-of-the-line including the varied brands of liquor. The past 20 years we have never returned to a resort, always looking for the best. WE SHALL RETURN to Iberostar Bavaro. After getting the tourist card for $10 and a couple tips, bury your wallet til you must leave. Our stay was 3/18 to 3/25 04

<Content>This is definitely worth a return trip !!!!!!!!!! My friend and I stayed there from March 21st to 28th. Overall the stay was excellant. The weather was really warm. It only rained one day and a few times the day before that. The only thing I would suggest to the management is to have some top shelf vodka available like Absolut, or Stoly. The service is excellant and the entertainment was unexpectedly outstanding. STAR FRIENDS kept us busy and laughing and dancing and entertained all day and night. The language barrier was not a problem; my rusty Spanish and the employees' patience and knowledge of English took care of everything we needed. The food was good and available at any time of day or night somewhere on the property. Our rooms were cool, clean and well stocked. The Dominican people were smiling and friendly and a treat to be around. We're already planning a return trip some time soon !

<Content>A GREAT Vacation! A group of 16 of us traveled from Iowa to Chicago and got on a plane for Punta Cana. I am F/18 and I was with my 5 friends, my family, and their parents. The plane ride was excellent although there was a long delay in Chicago due to weather. Upon arriving, the Punta Cana airport was really clean and everyone was very helpful. We got through customs quickly and arrived promptly at Iberostar Punta Cana. The check-in went quick and the bellboys brought our luggage to our rooms. The beach was amazing, very clean, soft sand, and and beautiful. The water was really nice and not too cold, there were a few waves but nothing that bothered us at all. MAKE SURE to reserve your lounge chairs no later than 8 AM by draping a towel on them because they fill up quick!! Don't lose your towel card! There is a charge! The scenery and parks at the hotel were BEAUTIFUL! Everything was soo well kept, even the hallways between rooms have palm trees growing in between, it was definitely a site to see! The rooms were soo spacious, just make sure to air them out when u get there  keep the A/C always running! The minibar was free and if you leave a tip of $1-2 for the maid she'll restock double the drinks in there the next day( restocked daily)  put flowers everywhere! The food was amazing I don't know what other people are talking about when they say there's no varietyin the buffets!!! I still didn't get around to trying everything after 7 days!!! Make reservations early for the restaurants because they fill up fast and the food's awesome! Take some tours..we like the Outback Safari one and we really like the Manati Park tour! Swim w/the dolphins, it's awesome! There's a lack of nightlife so it was kinda dull after the AMAZING night shows done by the Star Friends staff. The night shows are a MUST! DONT DRINK THE WATER!!!! Almost everyone in our group got sick, that's the ONLY thing to avoid, the food is safe so no worries! Do Parasailing it's amazing!!!! Try the drink Fantasia, it's really good and don't buy Rum 151 because it's illegal to bring to the U.S.  they WILL confiscate it! All other rums are fine to bring back, no prob! Small language barrier but they know a lot of languages so it's easy enough to communicate! A few topless Europeans on the beach not attractive neccessarily, especially old women!! Need lots of sunscreen no less than 30 SPF! Overall it was an awesome vacation, we all loved it and I'd definitely recommend it! Enjoy your vacation  e-mail me if u have any more questions!!!!!

<Content>Best Vacation Ever! We just returned from our vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro last night. There was a group of 10 of us and I can't think of one bad thing to say. It was the best vacation ever. Our rooms were beautiful and always clean. The housekeeping staff were friendly and very accomodating as were the diningroom staff. The food was excellent with so many choices. The grounds were beautiful with peacocks everywhere and the pool and beach area couldn't be nicer. We went on the day tour called the Bavaro Runners which I would highly recommend. The resort is beautiful but you should really experience how the people of the Dominican really live their life. We visited a sugar cane field and saw how it is harvested by hand and saw how the cocoa and coffee is harvested and roasted and also saw the rice fields. We went to an actual home of some of the Dominican people. They are much poorer than us but seem so much happier. We loved our trip there and can't wait to return.

<Content>Fabulous place for those who do not really want to party Iberostar Punta Cana is a very nice resort for couples or families, but definitely not for singles. I spent a week there in January and had a great time. Beach/pools: pretty nice. I never got up before 10am since I stayed at the club every night until 2am+ - and I was always able to find a chair... You DO NOT have to get up at 7am to secure a good spot..... Beach was especially relaxing -The food was great for an all-inclusive resort (I have been to many all-inclusives, and at this point - buffet is buffet no matter where).Grounds - very nice. Everything is clean, no problems of any kind.... and I am very picky.Room - nice but not exceptional in any way. Again, I usualy travel to 5 * all-inclusives and the room in Iberostar Punta Cana was no different than the rooms in similarly rated all-inclusive hotels.Entertainment. I am 27, attorney, and at that time was single. I loved the nightly shows featuring audience participation - like Mr. Iberostar, Ideal couple - it was really fun to watch. I was not impressed by the other shows - dancing, etc ( perhaps because I have seen these shows or pretty similar shows before in other hotels). Moreover, the bars/drinks - pretty good - although the drinks were not strong no matter how much liquor was used ( I ALWAYS TIPPED - I took about $200 for a week)....Club - pretty cool - except they play about 80% local music. In addition, a warning for singles planning to travel to this resort - go elsewhere - there were mostly COUPLES at the club (or anywhere for that matter). THe majority of people at the resort are actually OLDER COUPLES. I could not find almost any single professionals or even couples in my age group.... But remember - if you arrive as a group - let's say 10 singles - this hotel may work since you will end up entertaining each other. (For me - I was on my own - I should have chosen Jamaica.....although the hotel was nice).In conclusion, I WOULD recommend this resort for families or couples - 40+.

<Content>Outstanding! A friend and I enjoyed a week at Iberostar Bavaro. The hotel was lovely; nice accomodations, fine restaurants, beautiful grounds, Perfect beach (altho a bit windy), huge pool with swim up bar. Entertainment every nite. A continental flair with guests from many countries: Germany, France, Sweden, etc. A side trip with Outback Safari is also recommended. We saw NO political unrest - only friendly people. If you go out on your own, be careful of the crazy drivers and poor roads. Take a planned tour. Better yet, just stay at Iberostar. You can enjoy all 3 resorts they have on the beach. Delightful!

<Content>Family of 4 had a good vacation! My husband and I and our almost 4 year old boy/girl twins returned March 9 after 8 days at the Iberostar Punta Cana. The airport was fine. Once you get your luggage and go outside, there are tour representatives to direct you to your bus. We had a nice air conditioned bus, a good driver and the roads were fine. When we got to the resort, I had read that you could try to upgrade your room. When I got to the counter, I had my paperwork and a $20 bill folded up in my hand. I asked the guy what kind of room I had. And he said the one that I paid for. I asked if there was a suite available. And he said you get the one that you paid for. He was nice about it. So we went to our room and I thought at least I tried. When we got to our room, the phone rang and it was the guy from the front desk and he asked if I wanted a bigger room. He said he would be right there to show me one. It was a very nice suite with a separate room for the kids with 2 beds and a king size bed for us and a good view of the water and pool. He said it was the same price and I gave him the $20. I think because there were so many people checking in that he couldn't make the switch right away. In the rooms, you get many U.S. TV stations: CNN, Disney, HBO, NBC New York. We left the housekeeper a small gift (candles, soaps, candy) and $1-2 everyday. It is a good idea to reserve chairs by the pool by 7 or 8 am and by the beach by 8 or 9 am. We brought towels from home so it was easy to find our spots. We also brought inflatable rings and beach balls. For the kids we brought juice boxes, crackers and fruit snacks from home to take to the pool and beach. The beaches were very clean. We walked to the next resort and their beach wasn't as nice. The food was fine. We found something we liked for every meal. No one got sick. We ate lunch on the beach almost everyday. They served hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, etc. The Punta Cana side doesn't serve a lunch buffet but the Dominicana side does. Also on the Dominicana side near the beach is an ice cream bar. For dinner we tried the Star Rock Cafe and Steak Restaurant which were ok. The drinks were good. We had coco loco, pina colada, Miami vice and beer. They don't have the mini zoo or it was closed, not sure. We didn't try the kids club. Don't miss the flamingos. Every evening they are on the Punta Cana side as you are going to the lobby. During the day they are on the Dominicana side. We shopped in the lobby gift shop and at the shops inbetween the Dominicana and Bavaro and thought all were reasonable. I did mail postcards from the Punta Cana gift shop and no one has gotten they yet, so don't send them, just call. It's only $.50 a minute to call anywhere in the U.S. from your room. You just pay when you leave. You also pay for the room safe ($1 a day) when you leave. We had asked for the room safe key and the TV remote when we checked in. Most of the employees don't speak English, it was helpful that I speak enough Spanish to get by. Although they don't really speak English, the employees were very helpful and friendly and they loved the kids. They would do whatever they could to make you happy. And the same people were always working. Since we didn't take any excursions because the kids were along, we probably could have stayed for only 5 days vs. 8 days. But overall it was a nice, relaxing family vacation.

<Content>Loved Punta Cana I just returned from a week stay at Iberostar Punta Cana. I traveled with 3 other girls ages 22-28. We had a blast. We couldnt understand why the place got such bad reviews. The food wasnt good, but we found something we liked each night. This was the first vacation I ever took and lost weight. The drinks were very good. Dont bother with the resteraunts, they were worse then the buffett. The beach, pool and grounds were beautiful. The room was good. Didnt see any bugs at all. The staff was wonderful. They really go out of there way to treat you well. I speak very little Spanish and it wasnt a problem at all. We liked it very much and would go back. Hope this was helpful.

<Content>Beautiful wedding Stayed at IB-Bavaro from 03-9/03-16 and had our wedding on 03-12 on the beach! The service is superior and the wedding coordinator had everything down perfect. (Thanks Carolina!!) The 3-peice guitar band even playd La Coock-a-racha for me after the service. The photos were great and we received 48 photos, a photo book, plus all the negatives burned onto a CD for $155...what a steal. There are plenty of things to do inside and outside of the resort. We went with 9 other couples and everyone had a blast. I would reccomend the trip to Saona Island...good party on the boat...lots of rum, beer, soda, etc. I didn't like the Monster Truck Jungle Safari...very boring and the bus driver from the hotel to the city of Higuey was nuts...and intoxicated (shot glass in hand). The police are not allowed by the government to enforce traffic laws (which don't exist) so you will see accidents. On 03-14 we saw 2 fatality accidents on the way to Higuey. Other than that, we had a wonderful time and we plan on going back for our anniversary.

<Content>great time we just got back from the iberostar punta cana.after reading the reviews before we went (wife  i) we decided to go with an open mind. from the moment we got there we thought we had just arrived at fantasy island. the grounds are beautiful. employees are always busy doing thinks just for the purpose of making the guests happy. food was good.plent to eat with a huge variety. you will never go hungry. if you don't like the way something tastes, get something else.the iberostar punta cana  dominica are basically the same hotel. just different buildings.you share everything. restaurants, pools, bars, etc.the room was fine, but how much time will you spend in it. not much we discovered. i guess in a nut shell, after reading all the negative reviews this place was beyond our expectations. i imagine you could find flaws at the plaza hotel in new york if you looked hard enough. we saw all the positives  had a great time. would we go back?? in a heartbeat

<Content>Relax and enjoy We just returned from a week's stay (March 6-13, 2004) at the Iberostar Bavaro. I agree with the reviewer who stated If you don't have a good time at this resort, it's your own fault. The facilities are top-notch; very clean and well cared-for. We enjoyed the animals roaming the grounds - we fed the peacocks by hand, and watched with fascination as the kingfishers and egrets used the bread we threw as bait to catch fish. We were prepared with room freshener (which we used) and dryer sheets (which we didn't use) to help with the damp smell in our room, but in all honesty, we didn't have a problem. It was slightly humid, but when you're in the tropics, what do you expect? We left $20 at the beginning of our stay for our housekeeper, and we always had excellent care. We had a couple of glitches - one day the air conditioner didn't work and it got oppressive in the room, but they had it fixed by evening and it cooled off fine for our sleeping. Two days they had water problems on the property, and we had no water. It was, of course, late afternoon when we all wanted to shower and get ready for dinner. The problem was rapidly fixed, and didn't cause too much trouble. The employees of the resort were happy to help me with my rusty Spanish, and were always very helpful. The beach is fabulous - we went down about 7:30 each morning and put towels on the lounge chairs we wanted to reserve our chairs and cabana - and we never had a problem with anyone disturbing them. In fact, we left our bags there while we went to lunch and never had them touched. We walked down the beach to the market, and enjoyed haggling for a few trinkets. We didn't take any excursions, so we can't review those. We enjoyed the Mexican specialty restaurant the most. Don't bother with the steak house if you come from the midwest - the rib eye was a thin slab of chewy beef. The Japanese was OK - but slow service. We felt the buffets were well-stocked and had plenty for everyone. We loved the cafe con leche, and enjoyed putting some in styrofoam cups to take back to our beach chairs. The entertainment team stayed mostly by the pool during the day, so if you're on the beach you can relax and it's fairly quiet. The pool seemed to be where the young people congregated. They also have a nice kiddy-pool. All in all it was fabulous and I'd go back in a minute. Oh - Condor Airlines out of Chicago was fantastic - we booked through Apple and travel, transport and service was phenomenal.

<Content>Loved Iberostar Bavaro Staying at Iberostar turned out to be a wonderful experience. We enjoyed the food, beach, discos, spa and could not be more pleased with the staff. Everyone went out of their way to make your stay the very best possible. I will definitely return and I highly recommend the Iberstar for anyone looking to have a fabulous vacation.

<Content>Hola! HOLA!!! My boyfriend and I spent 7 wonderful nights at the Iberostar Punta Cana......we had a great time! Everything was so beautiful......and the staff was so friendly. Some of my favorite things there were the color of the ocean, the music, the great weather, and the beautiful grounds at the hotel. The room was nice too.....definately large enough for the 2 of us. We had 2 really nice dinners at the Steak Restaurant.....it is right on the beach....that was soooooo romantic (even if he didn't realize that it was......hahahaha!!!). It is a vacation that I will always remember......a paradise for sure!!! If you have any questions about Punta Cana or about the Iberostar please feel free to e-mail me. Have a good trip....... !!!!!

<Content>Nice but wouldn't go back I just got back from a 4 day trip to DR. I traveled w/ 3 other single girls age range 27-37. The positives: entertainment, pool, hotel staff, hotel grounds. The negatives: the food, the beach, the drinks, language barrier. I've been to several other carribean islands and this one does not compare. Turks  Caicos is probably the best that I've visited thus far. The beach at Punta Cana is very crowded and not as clean as I expected it to be. The ocean was extremely rough and a lot of seaweed. It was impossible to float and relax on a raft in the ocean. Regarding the language, I speak a little spanish so we were able to get by. Very few hotel staff speak good english. The drinks are not like here in the states. They do not make strawberry daquiris or any other drink that i'm used to in other carribean resorts. No captin morgan rum and no other familiar liquor. THe beer is good and the wine was good but don't expect fruity drinks. Our hotel room was ok, the frig does not get cold, we had a leak in our room which they promptly fixed. The worse thing was in the hospitality room....we saw a huge cockroach!! And the workers at the hotel said it was a crab....I don't think they know what a crab is b/c that was not a crab! I would not choose to stay at this hotel again nor would i go back to the Dominican. There is not much to do there if your looking for great tours. I didn't find a tour through the poor country a great thing to do on vacation and thats pretty much all they offered. The apple vacation representative was very helpful and honest! The Star Friends were so much fun and provided some great entertainment. Shopping is very cheap there as well! The food - not good. My cousin has been sick for the past 2 days since we returned. I did drink the water b/c they said it was purified and I did not get sick. I did not eat any fruits or salads which my cousin did eat. As for the disco, it was fun but thats all there is to do at night. This is not a place for young single girls....rather a place for older couples. Hope this helps!

<Content>Good luck, you're going to need it! We just returned from Punta Cana, Iberostar and this was the worst vacation ever. Lets start with the positive, the staff was very friendly, and the grounds were very beautiful, beautiful pool and beach. Now lets get to the negatives and there are a lot! TO MANY EUROPEANS for me, they all smoke everywhere and throw their cigarette butts everywhere, the beach is littered with them!! They say Americans are overweight, oh my if I see another fat euro in a speedo I'm going to be sick!! Also, most Euros are the rudest people I have ever come across. THE FOOD SUCKED!! they need to hire an American to show them how to cook American food!! The alcohol, well there is no American Beer, only some crap called Presidente and the mixed drinks were also very cheap. Do not eat in the tropical or the gourmet restaurant, they were not good. The Mexican restaurant was good and they had Corona, which is the only place they had Corona. The steak house was ok and I heard the asian one wasn't bad either. The buffets were tolerable but same food everyday, also I did find a piece of ceramic in my chicken. The ice cream was by far the best. Basically when it came to the food, I guess I am to Americanized for it! Also, the so called mini bar is only drinks no snacks, so take some snacks with you!! They also seem to have a carbonation problem with soda, all soda tasted flat! We did get good luck with the weather sunny 6 out of 7 days. A few things they could have done to improve the experience, have waiters at the pool and beach. Also, clean up the beach, put in some slides at the pool, and have some water activities that I do not have to pay $100 dollars for. Also, speaking of money do not buy a raft from one of the shops. a $2 dollar raft at home costs $15, take your own raft. If you can try and stay in the new building the room was very nice, compared the the older ones. The only problem is it stunk really bad and now my luggage smells like it, so take some lysol, and the water they use to water the grass smells like sewer water so stay away from it! Also, they make you buy an adapter to use any electrical appliances. Now this is the dumbest thing I have ever heard of, they provide an iron, but I have to buy an adapter to use it! Finally, would I go back? only if they paid me!

<Content>Is It Worth The Money? I just returned from the IberoStar Punta Cana on 3-11-04. It's easy to overlook some problems especially when the weather is perfect (Sunny and Hot). The beach and grounds of this hotel are beautiful but the hotel is not without it's share of problems. Some of these I could not overlook. Well to start off the room was average quality. I found large bugs in my room near the bed and in the bathroom. The sliding glass doors were broken and would not lock. The water faucet in the bathroom spewed out black gunk until it became completely clogged. There was a foul smell in the room. The refrigerator did not work good at all.  The food quality was poor to average at best. The drinks were not very good. The entertainment was average. The beach is one of the best I've seen. The palapas are great for shade from the hot sun but they get taken up fast. The beach does get crowded. The hotel grounds are very beautiful and tropical.  Some suggestions if you do try this hotel are: #1. Do not get a room on the ground floor next to the swamp with the carp swimming in it. #2. Get up early(by 8 AM) and get a good spot on the beach or by the pool. They get taken up early. #3. Bring a thermal mug for your drinks. #4. Bring a lot of sun block. #5. Bring a hair dryer. The one in the room does not work very good. #6. Disregard the topless women on the beach. I saw large people that really shouldn't be taking their clothes off in public. #7. Learn Spanish to speak with the staff. Learn German,French and Italian to speak with the people around you.  In summary if you want to spend your money on a good time on the beach and don't care what your eating,drinking or sleeping with then this place is for you. It wont be for me again.

<Content>Beautiful Place We were at the Bavaro from 2/28/ thru 3/6/2004. The hotel is beautiful, the food is good and the beach is the BEST! Take mugs for beer etc., it was really windy the first few days, couldn't lay on the beach because you would get sand blasted, was really glad we brought our mugs. Unfortunately, when we were there, my son ended up in the hospital back in the states. If you are leaving your kids at home, make sure you have a Power of Attorney made up in case of an emergency like we had. I never thought anything would happen like this and it made things more difficult when dealing with the hospital. Also, just for your information, we had to make alot of long distance calls (2 pages worth) You can dial direct from your room, there is a $1.00 connect charge and then it is about .48 per minute. Our bill was $69.00. I didn't think that was so bad considering all the calls we made. So much for the bad part, we tried to enjoy our stay as much as we could under those circumstances. A big hi to Lana and Vlad, Jerry and Gary from detroit and the group we met from Erie, Pa. The people we met there were really nice. Only saw one bug in our room, actually, we had the balcony door open at night and never saw any bugs get into our room. It was nice to hear the sound of the ocean when laying in bed. Bring a clock, you don't need bug repellant and I didn't need to use candles in our room. I am jealous of anybody that is going to be going there. Wish i could go back and have a better time! Oh well, stuff happens! Have a Great trip, you won't be sorry you stayed at the Bavaro!

<Content>Wonderful Just got back from our trip on March 10. The hotel is wonderful and the place is out of this world. I somtimes think people complain because they are just not happy and there is no place that would make them happy. The whole trip was great and the people that work there do everthing they can for you. The food was very good , no one got sick in our group. The weather was really good, do take sun screen. All I can say is I can't wait to go back, and we will stay at the Bavaro.

<Content>Loved it! I don't know where to begin! I was so hesitant from the get go to travel here and boy am I glad I did and didn't listen to the negative reviews. Someone had wrote a while back that anyone that has to complain about this place should stay at home and boy are they right! You people will never be pleased with anything. My husband and I went with 3 other couples and between the three couples we have all traveled from Hawaii to Aruba to Mexico (Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and ) to Cruises (bahamas, and Virgin Islands) Florida, and more and this was the best place any of us had been too. We got back on 3-5 and were sad to be leaving. There is a lot to do or nothing to do if you prefer. We did take the safari trip for the day and that was very good. It taught you a lot about the natives of the DR. We chose to do nothing the rest of the trip and it was great. The beach is wonderful. It was windy most of the time we were there and some people were complaining about it, but the last day we were there it had quit and boy was it hot! We were thankful for the wind. Food was unbelievable. You were never left hungry and if you were that's too bad! No you don't get sick! None of us got sick! Actually the only ones that got sick were the ones that drank too much! Our Apple rep mentioned to us that they all use purified water for everything, the natives don't even drink their own water. And that if you do get sick most of it is from all the foo foo drinks you are drinking, the sun and all the different foods you can eat. The combo of all those will make anyone sick. It's not the food itself. But, all in all it was great and I would go back. Everytime we would try something new or do something new that we had read about in the reviews that people had complained about we couldn't believe that people had actually complained! You people should stay home!!!! Yes, there was a language barrier at times, but your in THEIR COUNTRY! What do you expect! We actually found it kind of fun to learn and talk with the people because they did always try to understand and help you. The Star Friends are amazing! Those people are working all the time and have so very much energy it's amazing. Entertainment was good. If you are having hesitation don't! Go! I miss it very much already! And those of you that had negative reviews stay at home from now on so you don't ruin someone else's vacation from reading your negativity!!! Yes, there are a few little things here and there, but if you have traveled before you should know them. And don't fret because it's not worth it. So, when you get there they take your luggage for you and you have to wait 1/2-1 hour for your room to be ready...so what! Go have a drink and chill out! So, you'd rather haul it all to your room? If you are a frequent traveler you should know to pack your suit and shorts in your carry-on to change into so you can hit the beach right away if you want to. They do everything for you. Sometimes you might have to wait, but is that so bad when you are in a beautiful place on vacation?

<Content>Loved Iberostar Bavaro!!! I have never been to the Carribean before and I found this place so beautiful!!! I stayed at Bavaro from Feb. 14 - 21 and it wasn't long enough. I went with my family: My grandpa, aunt, cousins, mom, and brother. Although the hotel is awsome at the beginning of the week I was kind of lonely and wishing for someone my age to hang out with - enter Star friends!!! Those guys are great! They work their tails off! I really admire that and they still smile. It was also great to talk to them about their lives and learn about dominican life. My family and I also signed up for 3 trips outside of the resort. The Safari was great! It really shows you the life outside of the resort. We also went on a catamaran to Saona Island and on the Marinarium for snorkeling. All the trips were great and the dominicans on them were great also. They listen to their music and sing and dance. Its awsome to watch but even more fun to dance to! Anyways, we ate at the buffet all week and I really enjoyed it. It really gave you a chance to try everything. The beach and the pool we beautiful also even though I didn't go down to our beach to swim the pool was very refreshing. I have also read alot of reviews were people complained about the language barrier. I found that the most interesting part of the trip! I loved trying to learn Spanish and trying to talk to the workers! I learned so much over the week and was speaking it so often that I went home saying Hola and Grasis to people! Although I got funny looks I enjoyed it! I had also heard that even though Americans are the minority that you run into alot of VERY rude europeans but you know what? I didn't. I found that the hole experience of the mixed culture was very interesting. I had a very nice week and I hope to go back very very soon. The weather was great except for Tuesday it rained until about mid-afternoon but even then I was just enjoying having some warm weather. At night my family and I all went down to the shows and every one I saw I enjoyed! I even got drug up onto the stage once! Advice for anyone heading to Iberostar soon is pack light, tip well, enjoy yourself, and don't worry about a thing! Our plane ride was very smooth. Having my grandpa with us who is slightly handicap seeing that he can't walk any distance without being short of breath because of a lung disease he has wasn't much of a problem. We had a wheel chair provided for him and he really enjoyed himself. At the airport in Punta Cana about 5 dominican men carried him out of the plane on this belted seat deal - he really looked like a king out there! We were able to wheel him around all week - mostly from our rooms to the buffet and then to the pool. The Star friends really got to know him and would call out his name as we wheeled by. It really made his day.But I think I'll shut up now - it feels like I wrote a book! All I can say is my vacation was wonderful and I want to go back tomorrow! No, yesterday!

<Content>The place was beautiful, the food was bad.  Iberostar punta cana was not what i spected. i have been to the one in Puerto Plata and is 10 times better. One more thing if your planing to go there be careful with the water. MY brother almost get sick when he was about to drink water with beach in it. Good thing that he just drank a sip. The place was nice but the food was bad.

<Content>Loved Iberostar Bavaro We just came back from a wonderful stay at Iberostar Bavaro, Punta Cana from 2/15/-2/22/04. We all had a great time. We stayed at Bavaro Princess in August/04 and thought it was really nice, but Iberostar Bavaro is the best. The rooms were always clean...the towels always plenty! The food, drink and people were wonderful and very friendly. The Star Friends staff work very hard and were very friendly, we made some friendships and exchanged information with some of them. For the reviewer with the comment of ugly americans from New York I would just like to say that you cannot speak for everyone who is from New York. We are from New York and are Italian-Americans. We do appreciate the food, the fact that there were alot of Europeans and less Americans was fine for us but we did run into some ugly europeans also. Some were nice but some were very rude. So it isn't just americans from New York. Alot of americans are willing to try new things and some aren't. You have to appreciate fine food to love the Iberostar Bavaro. The weather was great except for one day it rained but we didn't mind it as much! We just hated to leave! Looking forward to next time!!

<Content>Good time If you are looking for a nice place, with the nicest workers, go to this hotel. There was 4 of us that went and we had an awesome time! None of us got sick and we all enjoyed the company of the workers! They will make you go on the dance floor with them and dance, its a BLAST! We all stayed pretty cautious of our food we checked the meat to make sure it was cooked and it was delicous! Some people complained about it but it was good. There are resturants you can eat at. Also, if you walk down the beach you can go to these shops where the locals go to sell there stuff. There is beautiful jewlery! But, DONT be afraid to barter with them because you will get it for ALOT cheaper! Well, if I could I would go back there in a heartbeat! I hope you choose this hotel and have a great stay!

<Content>IB Bavaro has our hearts The only reason to give this resort a bad review would be so that the whole world doesn't find out about what a jewel it is, and then the price would go up and availablity would go down. We just returned last night from Iberostar Bavaro (7 glorious days) and want to book again already. We are early 40's and took our 14 and 18 yr old sons with us. Hands down, the best all inclusive we have been to (Mexico 2x, Puerto Plata and one other resort in Punta Cana). We chose this resort because we had been to the IB Paraiso in Mexico and really loved the Iberostar quality, but the beach was just okay. The IB Bavaro has a drop dead gorgeous beach, the rooms are really nice, the food is very good (the beach grill for lunch is incredible, try the grilled steak, and the paella when they have it). The grounds are beautiful. The people are friendly and most do speak some English or at least will really try. Our 14 yr old joined in many activities which were well organized. One note of caution - they would have served alcohol to the 14 yr old without question (he looks at least 16), so if you have any concerns about your youngish teen drinking, ask them for a child coloured wrist band (red) when you check in, rather than the adult coloured band (gray). I don't know if they will do it (we didn't ask, because we were confident our young teen wouldn't try to drink), but it is worth a try if you have any concerns. To the staff of the IB Bavaro, you have succeeded where others have failed...keep up the good work, we will be back next year.

<Content>Wiccccked Time! We went from feb 4th-11th. I am 17 and I went with my family of four, my mom and dad aged 40ish and brother 19. Lots of people my parents ages..not too many kids our ages but lots of young kids. We had a greaaaat time! Couldnt ask for more, although there was a few things I would have changed. Such as the rooms could be lighted more but I feel this way cuz I love lots of light so yeah and minus me and my family getting sick, I was sick on the plane all the way home too :S and for about a week after but that cuz I ate and drank a lot and I was in the sun a bit too much..but anyways the hotel was great, the roomservice was perfect, mind you the maids and garden workers around the hotel didnt speak any english, but the people actually working spoke quite a bit. there wasnt too many canadians either, quite a bit of europeans..lots of guys in speedos! and lots of big old topless women :S haha. the food was to die for, there was everything you could ask for, which is good cause everyone has different tastes, we went to all the restaurants and the buffets, the MORNING BUFFET IS THE BEST! try to pancake vanilla syrup! ahah it was nuts. bahama mamas are the best drink. and the nite entertainment was great! theres 2 guys, rolando and mike, they are the best..and they also work around the pool during the day, the workers work about 16 hour shifts 12 or so days in a row and most of them live at a near by hotel, but they were really nice. more spanish guys that girls around too. the market down the beach was fun! lots of bargaining, always go for half what there asking for and settle on 60% if u walk out and say too much, they will run after u and let u take it for what u want, lots of those guys kissed me and my mom on the cheeks and what not. cheapy cheapy is what they like to say :P the outback safari is the best. our tour guides were nacho and uncle candy they were ablast and could speak gooood english. bring suntan lotion!!! u get a really good meal on this trip and get to see what real dominican life is really like, cause the resort is a fake version..u see how chocolate and coffee are made and u learn a lot about the dominican. cameras are a must on the whole trip, we took a lot of pictures. i wanted to go parasailing soo bad but my brother chickened out so my mom came with and she even said she'd do it again! its not scary at all, its smooth up and smooth down. we went on one snorkeling tour, waste of money, the tour bus forgot about us, so they sent a van for us with a spanish speaking driver who couldnt speak a word of english. we were scared to go because everyone tells you not to go somewhere with someone you dont know itsjust common sense. but we ended up going and he drove like a maniac more than the other drivers, and he took us down some bad neighborhoods and really we were all scared. when we finally got where the rest of the group was everyhting was disorganized, for lunch we got a sandwich! old stale bread and like 3 slices of meat..a sandwich for 80 bucks a person US i dont think so..we met a lot of couples and families who felt the same about this trip, but those were the only things to complain about. the pool was awesome, the rooms big, make sure u run down early in the morning and put towels on the chairs u want otherwise they will all be gone, umm you dont even have to tip the guys at the bar. they give u good service either way. we tipped a few guys at the end. one worker told me he makes 900 pesos a month. which is 18 dollars US!!! the disco..well its a lot of older ladies, 40+ so me and my brother did not enjoy that. do everything through the resort, most tours and stuff on the beach are ripoffs. i got my hair braided for 40$ US at the resort which was really good. there was a lot to do. the water is all bottled so dont even worry. by the end of your stay you will know their special song off by heart. oh and if it rains its usually just for like 10 mins so its not big, it clears and clouds soo fast there. the weather is something we didnt worry about. there is computer access too. 60 pesos for a half hour. theres more things i cant remeber but you can email me if you want to know more!!! it was a great trip, i want to go back. and all the workers were super friendly, think if u worked a 16 hour day 12 days in a row would u still be smiling? i wouldnt be..so i dont see how they can!!! good luck if you go! the resort was beautiful and just perfect size.

<Content>7 nights in paridise,,,hola!!! we just returned from 7 nights at the beautiful punta cana resort! my girlfriend and i loved our trip! the staff is always smiling and work very hard to please you! our hair dryer went out in our room and we called as you are told to do, and they replaced it before we returned to our room! we went on the outback safari $75 per person and we thought the country was beautiful! it is a very poor country and it makes you appreciate that we have it soo good here! we swam at the marinium also,that is $70 american! i loved that too, its a bit pricey, but for the experience that we had of accually swimming with sharks and sting rays,was worth it to me! the guide on the outback safari was a blast(eddys family is still no. 1) they take you to a typical dominican home! it is tiny but its also nice! they live very different then the typical american family, trust me on that! plus we tasted sugar cane, coco beans, and a small cup, about a shot of dominican coffee! at the resort, we couldnt find one thing to complain about at all, not that we are looking! theres tons of food i tried lots of different things, i ate only cooked food, we brushed our teeth with the bottled water in the room! we were sad to leave some of the friends, (the waitresses )that we had made in only 1 week! in conclusion we have decided that some people could complain over anything, keep your crabby-ass home! we had a blast, if you bring a smile with you, you will have a great time!,,, enjoy

<Content>Won't go back until I've visited everywhere else... We had a group of 13 and returned on Sunday, February 22, 2004. Everyone had diarreah even the week after we returned. Bring imodium. We felt a lot of bad attitude from almost all the servers and definately the europeans. Because we're americans? Maybe because of the uprising in Haiti? I had a family of four in my room and was too small. The beds aren't even as big as a full..more like a oversized twin. There was pull out that was not comfortable. While, another family of four got a suite and did not pay extra. We tried to upgrade and no such luck. Also rooms are very dark-not enough light. No iron and the dryer hardly blew air. So bring your own with and adaper. Rooms also need a coffee maker! We did the Soana Island tour and that was worth the money! $80.00/adult and 40.00/child. Dominicana side was a lot more happening than the Punta Cana side. And watch the kids. They will serve them rum as long as they tip them. A couple of nights there was an awful odor in the air..smelled of sewage. I won't go back until I've visited everywhere else.

<Content>Awesome vacation!! My husband and I spent a wonderful, relaxing week at the Iberostar Bavaro from Feb 14 to Feb 21. After reading some lukewarm reviews, I was concerned. Let me tell you that upon arrival at 10:30 am, we were in our room within 15 minutes after enjoying a welcoming fruity/rum drink. The room was perfect....king size bed, spacious, plenty of closet space and a wondeful sliding door that we kept open most of the time. We were on the 2nd floor. Our proximaty was great too...close to the beach and pool. We loved the QUIET!!! Fresh flowers in the room were a bonus and a rose from the staff at Iberostar. Two things that we loved the most were the people from the Dominican and the fact that as Americans, we were the minority. We loved being surrounded by different languages and we learned alot of Spanish. The Dominican people are so friendly and happy and willing to teach us the language. My husband played volleyball every day with mostly Germans and was speaking a bit of German by the end of the week! Food was excellent! The choices were overwhelming. We ate at 3 of the restaurants. We loved them all, but liked LaDorado the best...Carribean with all seafood. We lived on seafood all week. Lobster, mussels, shrimp for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! The buffet was awesome too. Because it caters to the Europeans, there were many, many food choices. No reason to ever be hungry! Fresh fruit is always plentiful and excellent! We enjoyed the spa. My husband had 3 massages on the beach and we both spent an afternoon in the spa. It was a great experience. One day, we did the Bavaro Runners and spent the entire day in the mountains visiting cocoa and coffee plantations and horsebackriding. It was a great way to experience Dominican culture. We would go back in a minute! No complaints except for the gourmet restaurant being too noisy and having to put up with a few ugly Americans, those that whine and complain about everything and are downright RUDE to the workers. They seem to come from NYC and they certainly have a reputation for being belligerent. I don't understand why anyone would promote themselves to be that way!! OH! The water. Never, never,never drink the tap water. The natives don't drink it either. Brush your teeth with the bottled water left in the refrigerator for you. We went with all the stomach remedies and never had to use them. We ate, drank and sunned in moderation. That is key! Hope this was helpful. We met some wonderful people from all over the world and the workers, the Star Friends were all wonderful too. Talk about hard workers!!! They put in 16 hour days, work 21 days straight and then get 3 days off. And they are always smiling!!! Enjoy!!! We'll be going back.

<Content>Thankful I went for 12 days Stayed at the Hotel from 8 Feb to 19 Feb and I am very thankful I did not listen to the negative reviews of this hotel. My wife and I and another couple spent 12 days at the Iberostar and I would go back in a heart beat. If you are looking for gourmet food, stay in Chicago for a week. However, if you can't find decent food at the buffet, you are not looking. The resturants are great and so is the service. The Chineese, Mexican and Steak house were my favorites. We spent our time by the pool and walking the glorious beach. What a fantastic way to relax. Get over the topless. Most of the women should not be allowed on the beach fully clothed, let alone topless. Not a big deal. Food, service and location are excellent. Did not leave the resort area with the problems in Haiti. Really no need to leave the resort. The drinks were good and if they were not strong enough, drink straight alcohol. A few bucks in tips goes a long way. Would return in a heart beat. Thankful I booked a 12 day trip then started reading reviews. If you are there to relax and enjoy the sun, who gives a darn about any one around you, no matter how they act. The Europeans were fine, and not that many of them at the Iberostar. Mostly Canadians and Americans. Have fun.

<Content>Be careful what you eat Ten of us returned from Iberostar, Punta Cana on Feb. 17th after an 8 day stay. I must say the hotel itself was beautiful, and the staff was fabulous (tipping does go a long way), however the food was not the best. The majority of us got sick from the food, bring your Tums and Immodium if you plan on eating. Also bring salt and pepper as the food is quite bland. I was suprised at how rude the Europeans are, maybe it was just because we were American. Anyway, I am glad we went, but do not intend on going back. Bring your own insulated cup/mug too for your drinks/beer, and try to reserve a spot on the beach early. I would also reccomend the four wheeling tour, that was pretty neat/fun. This is a very poor country with a lot of trash everywhere outside the resort, it makes me feel proud to live where I do.

<Content>Fabulous! Love Iberostar - visit from 2/11-2/18 I'll try to keep this short. This is the 2nd Iberostar we've stayed at. The other we visited was the IB. Paraiso beach in playa del carmen Mexico which was absolutely wonderful. Although both are beautiful - we prefer this one. The food was much better at the Bavaro than in Mexico. The beach was better as well. The people were very friendly and many spoke english very well. Our housekeeper was great. We had the same one all week. The A La Carte restaurants were good - loved the Japanese and Mexican. I have to say the gourmet restaurant was just OK but that's because I am a spoiled New Englander who is used to delicious Maine Lobster. Their lobster is very different - good - but nothing I would ever get again. We spent most of our time on the beach, or at the pool bar. We went with another couple who also agree this place was fantastic. Some of the shows were great and the disco was fun. Met some great Canadians and some frenchmen I couldn't understand but we had a blast! Even bargaining with the shops on the beach was fun. The weather was mid eighties every day - It rained our 2nd to last day there in the am and then stayed cloudy but that gave us an opportunity to go horseback riding when it wasn't blazing hot. We both do not burn easily but got really burnt the 1st day on the beach so I recommend some level of sunscreen for all. This was the vacation we needed - lots of fun, sun and stress free!! Also - we missed our connecting flight on the way down - originally we were booked from 2/10-2/17. Both the airline and the hotel changed everything around for us at no charge. I am forever grateful to them for that. I would definitely come back to the Bavaro again and again! One thing to note - somewhere along the way - my husbands cell phone was stolen from his suitcase along with some disposable cameras before we reached the hotel so make sure all valuable items are in your carry-on or lock your luggage like I did:)

<Content>Nice place, bad food If you like bland food, cheap beer and rude Europeans - this is the place for you.11 of us just returned from a week in DR. The hotel was beautiful, but all of us were disappointed in the food and the drink selection. This is the first Caribbean resort I've stayed at that didn't have blenders behind the bar. Going back to Cozumel next time.

<Content>Best vacation ever!! my boyfriend and I stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana for 5 days. We both agreed that this is the best all inclusive package so much better. the rooms were gorgeous and we were on the bottom floor. i did not see one bug- i was looking out for them because everyone told me about them. there were none. the people working in the hotel were so nice and generous. we did tip the maid and one day she left us desserts and a bottle of liquor. make sure you get out to the beach early and reserve a hut. the food was very good. we had no problems and we did not get sick or even feel sick. the grounds are so beautiful everything is marble and extremely clean. we went parasailing and that was alot of fun. the only thing is there is no iron in the room. we are planning on returning next year. it was a vacation in paradise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great All-Inclusive Resort! February 2004: I just returned from an 8 night stay at the Iberostar Punta-Cana. I have previously stayed at All-Inclusive establishments in St. Maarten, St. Lucia and Turks  Caicos. The Iberostar Punta-Cana was by far the best facility I have stayed at yet. Disregard any stories below about food-poisoning, bugs in the rooms, etc. This place is spotless, the grounds and the beach is beautiful, and the rooms, food, drinks and service were all great! I will without a doubt be returning to this place.

<Content>The perfect week Stayed the week of 1/28 - 2/04/04 - This was a girlfriend trip, two ladies with a fair amount of travel experience looking for RR and to celebrate mutual birthdays. Never had been to the Dominican Republic, love the Carribean, never did all inclusive so not sure what to expect. Adventurous diners, enjoy inventive and high quality cuisine. Appreciate creature comforts but flexible. Needed to watch budget (guilt) as families not included! The staff was gracious and always helpful, our accommodations were clean and comfortable, the grounds were beautiful and carefully maintained, and the food was exceptional! We were amazed at the quantity and diversity of the buffet offerings, and although we dined at the specialty restaurants, the regular daily offerings were more than we could have asked for. The Japanese and French restaurants were our favorite specialties, and we made our reservations at the beginning of our stay. Even over the weekend when the hotel was at full capacity the ambience remained upbeat yet relaxing. The management is excellent and it seems that every guest has unlimited access to all of the resort's amenities. We met wonderful people from Canada and Europe, and many were return visitors. Families, groups, and couples all seemed to be enjoying themselves. We hope to return regularly and share this place with our families and other friends!

<Content>Fun resort, a few minor problems Just came back from 7 days at the Iberostar Punta Cana. Spent most of the time at the beach and pool. The weather is fabulous and the beach and pool are breathtaking. Drinks were fine - our group varied with their drinks, no one had any complaints. The rooms were decent. I would recommend requesting a room above the first floor. None of our parties had any bugs, as I had read from previous reviews. We tipped our maids daily and left notes requesting any items (ie: diet coke, extra towels). I had a stocked fridg. daily. Unfortunately, the food was average. The buffet gets a little tiring and the specialty restaurants are a little on the bland side. I would recommend the Mexican Restaurant (Coronnas!!) and the Steak House. In the afternoon, the steak house also offers a buffet lunch which has a lot of grilled food and is a lot better than the restaurant near the pool by the Dominicana. The Star Friends were a lot of fun and there were plenty of activities for all age groups. The spa was wonderful. Two in our group got massages near the pool and loved them. Word to the wise, a little tipping goes a long way. Bring the Pepto and the Imodium. Our group needed both. All in all, our group had a wonderful time and would return again. We met a lot of fun people and have great memories of the trip.

<Content>The time of our lives! We traveled to Iberostar Bavaro From Jan30-Feb 6, 2004. EXCELLANT WEATHER... We were very nervous about the hotel and everything due to some bad reviews we had read. Well, let me tell you, we had the time of our lives. First, the people that you meet that work at the hotel are so friendly, you become such good friends. They go out of their way to make your stay marvelous. The entertainment was awesome day and night...if you can't find something to do, you have problems...sports, dancing, games, or just relax! About the food....YES the food is a bit different, but you have to realize you are in another country. I was worried because my husband is picky...however, we found the food to be excellant. The Buffets had such a variety, the restarunts were excellant. There were exotics foods and american food with a twist of Domican republic! If you couldn't find something you like, you're nuts! OUr only problem: When we arrived back home to the USA...we did suffer from diarrea for about 5 days. It was nothing that prevented us from doing our day to day activites...but it did occur. I think it just had to do with the fact that they use different ingredients in the foods than we do. Other people we know had this happen also. I would recomend taking along Immodium AD in case this would happen on your trip. This did not ruin our trip or anything....we loved it, and we can't wait to go back, we made so many friends and we had the time of our lives.

<Content>Just got back and I miss it already My husband and I just got back from a 2 weeks vacation at the Iberostar Bavaro. We truly loved it.The grounds are beautiful, the people are nice and the service is very good.The food is ok and sometimes more than ok. But I'm not disappointed by it, because I didn't expect the quality of a 5 stars restaurant. How can you make gourmet food for hundreds of people? Do you realize that for just one meal in a great restaurant there are more then 10 people involved? So please be realistic. One thing is for sure, you have plenty of variety and you are very hard to please if you don't find at least one thing you like. I don't recommend the wine though, but then again, heaven knows I didn't go there for that. The cocktails are excellent! Quiero une pina colada por favor!Finally, I'm pretty amazed by people who says that there is nothing to do! Those people must be very hard to please. My mother always said to me: If you feel bored, it's because YOU are boring.I very much recommend this hotel and the Dominican Republic in general, if you need to relax and want to know how it is to live in a postcard environment.Hasta luegoFroggy and her husband Kermito

<Content>Fine Experience I recently returned from the Iberostar Punta Cana two days ago and thought that my experience was, in general, fine. This is the second Iberostar that I have been to (Mexico - Parismo Del Mar) and thought that is was not as nice as the resort in Mexico. I thought the grounds, pool and beach were absolutely beautiful - better than most resorts. I thought the food was decent - a little bland for my taste but nice. I thought the drinks were not great and the drink/liquor selection were lacking. The evening shows were great. My only suggestion/criticism was the rooms. Although they were cleaned every day and appeared very clean the air freshner smell was over powering. I finally got used to it on the third day. The furniture in the rooms could also use some updating. Finally - I thought the bathrooms were outdated.I was a little hesitant about eating the food after all of the other bad reviews. I never got sick but was very careful about what I ate.

<Content>Pretty Grounds, but bad food and drink We went to the Iberostar last July. It is a very attractive propery with well maintained grounds and gardens (the peacocks and peahens add a nice exotic touch).Our first problem came when the connecting rooms we had requested were not available. It seems that Thomas Cook reserves all beach views and connecting rooms for German tourists and Apple Vacations doesn't have the clout to get the good rooms unless the Germans don't need them. The desk staff was very apologetic and helpful and, after only one night were able to get us connecting rooms. These rooms were nice enough and spacious.The staff throughout the resort was friendly, helpful, and seemed genuinely eager to provide excellent service.Unfortunately, we had a number of problems: 1) Food: Despite numerous specialty restaurants and an extensive main buffet, we never had a good meal. There was little variety and the quality of ingredients was very low. Further, there was far too little attention paid to maintaining safe temperatures in the largely open air restaurants and everyone in our family was sick at least part of the time. We had previously stayed at Club Med Punta Cana and found their food to be some of the best in the Club Med world, so it is not a common local problem 2) Drinks: The hotel is super all inclusive so all drinks are included. Unfortunately there is no option for upgrading to drinkable brands. Margaritas were identifiable by name only, not taste. The beer was only OK, which made it by far the best alcohol choice. 3) Activities: Very limited activities, although the beach and pools are pretty. The kids club was a joke; a single small group for (apparently) ages 4 to 12, with no facilities or equipment to speak of. Club Med remains the best choice for Kids Clubs in this class of resort. Activities for adults suffered from a lack of facilities, equipment, and trained staff. The hotel is advertised as having an extensive spa, but what we found were low-rent massage parlors on the beach. They did have a pretty good workout room, however.  Evening entertainment was enthusiastic and one of the better aspects of the hotel, although it suffered from poor (and insufficient) seating arrangements. These problems are particularly acute at a place like Punta Cana where there are virtually no options outside your hotel. The area is extremely isolated and rundown, so you better like where your are.

<Content>A little piece of Paridise My wife and I just returned from paradise yesterday I would like to say i had read every review i could about iberostar bavaro all suites and some were good and some made me nervous and made me wonder if i had made the right decision well let me say it was the best one of my life. We arrived at the resort on jan 31st and our first view was the entry way WOW this place is first class all the way. Check in was a breeze took us about 10 minutes and we were in our rooms and within 10 minutes of that our luggage was there . The pool is awsome but it could use fresh paint but it was not slippery it was cleaned every morning and scrubbed around the edges as well. the staff was always willing to help and eager to serve us the star friends is a group of people who are there to get you excited about the games and get people involved i have read reviews on how some people thought they were only there to pick up on women and they were scary . this is so far from the truth , these people are wonderful wew were with them every day. the rooms were wonderful always clean with flowers . the resturants were wonderful I think i tried so many different things and never once got sick. The only bad thing was that i had to leave .I would recomend this place to any body and if you have questions about it feel free to contact me .this was an awsome place to stay and as the locals say it was PERFECTO it was the best place ever.

<Content>Great! We went there a couple of weeks ago and I really think this resort is worth a recommandation. The whole resort is really beautiful, friendly people everywhere, big rooms who are well cleaned every day, nice food for everyone and a great 'holiday-spirit'! You must try it!

<Content>Loved Iberostar I vacationed at the Iberostar Bavaro Jan 26th thru Feb 2nd with my Son (29), My Daughter (27) her husband and Son (1). We had a great time. The resort was just beautiful. The people could not have been any nicer. All of the workers would come up and talk to my grandson and blow him kissies everyday. I can't say enough about this place. The week went by so fast we were sad to have to leave. There was so much food, and I thought it was great if you could not find something you liked then you just can't be pleased. I do not know how anyone could go there and not have a good time. The Star Freinds were great and the shows were alot of fun. Plenty to eat and drink, plenty of activities if you want to keep busy. Or you can just relaxe at the pool or beach. Had a wonderful time and can't wait to go back next year.

<Content>Have to Dispute claim from Vacationer from Chicago I recently read the review from a vacationer from Chicago and felt the need to clarify some things! My husband and I visited the IB in Punta Cana in May of 2002 on our honeymoon and had a wonderful time! I, also, have traveled a bit and have enjoyed stays in Mexico and the Camen Islands. One thing that I find is ESSENTIAL to point out from the Chicago article is that this was his family's FIRST all-inclusive trip!!! If you talk to anyone you should become very aware that when you vacation all-inclusive you will give up a little bit as far as quality. HOWEVER....we felt that the IB did a FANTASTIC job and I am used to nice things (my fav. place to eat in Chicago is the Bistro). We also ate at the specialty places inside the resort and found then to be wonderful!!! One restaurant served a 5 course meal!! We even love Sushi and had some wonderful Sushi there! I also would advise anyone who is planning on taking a trip to research where it is that you are going! This family obviously did not do their homework. Any web site you go to or travel agent you visit will inform you that the Dominican Republic is NOT Cancun, Mexico! There are NOT clube everywhere or a ton of things to do outside the resorts! What you will find is a country that is beyond beautiful! We felt like were in a scene from Jurrasic Park! I feel like this family did not research a thing cause there is also a very exciting full day trip called the Outback Safari (about 75.00 per person) that is a MUST!!! You travel in a huge open Jeep and travel way up into the mountains and see the entire island!! You can drink the entire time or not at all (it's up to you) the guide's are so FUNNY and speak GREAT engligh!! The inform you of SO MUCH!! You can buy fresh vanilla and other items from the island, you visit an actual family and get to see a typical house, you have a WONDERFUL lunch on top of a mountain (potato salad, fruit, sandwiches, chips, dessert, soda, cocktails) then you get to swim at a waterfall which has the most breathtaking picture spots!!!! and finally you end up boogy boarding in the ocean (on the other side from where the resorts are) so the waves are GREAT!!! I could go on and on!! I have not been to Hawaii but have several friends who have and Dominican food (so I hear) does not compare! You have to be willing to try another culture's food. DON'T go to Dominican if all you care about is 5-star meals! But if you are willing to try new things and are interested in seeing some of the most beautiful land I have ever seen, BOOK YOUR TRIP NOW!!! I can't wait to go back!! And by the way...we were there for 2 weeks, never got bored, and never got sick!! Just thought you might like to know! ENJOY YOUR TRIP!!

<Content>AS PERFECT AS IT GETS! We've been almost everywhere in the Caribbean and must say the beaches here are the best. There is white sand for miles and because the reef is dead there are no shells in the sand. The weather is perfect with hot sun and a cool breeze that makes your day on the beach pure heaven. The food is great and there is something for everyone, no matter how fussy. I do suggest that you take imodium with you. We did have a little trouble, but got over it quickly. I would suggest not eating any dairy, including the ice cream. We took two trips, the safari and the catamaran. The safari was great but the catamaran trip was one I wouldn't take again. It was a long day that ended up on a beach not that much better than our own. Take small bills with you like 10's and 20's. You will be glad you did. I'll make this short by saying we are going back next year without fail. The people, food, grounds, rooms and beaches are perfection. Enjoy!

<Content>Excellent location for a family reunion Had a fantastic trip at Iberostar Bavaro (first week of Jan, 2004). Met with relatives from South America and had a most memorable and grand family reunion. There were tons of acitivities for the entire bunch - including all the kids in our group. Did not have a worry in the world. The food was awesome, especialy the tropical fruits and the fresh fruit juices that you could drink at beck and call. (Sorry I do drink alcohol - even if it is free). It was like a luxurious cruise-ship but on land instead.Being a 'resident' at Iberostar Bavaro allowed us to go and visit and eat at the other 2 properties with no extra charge. (This is not true the other way around).Highly recommend this location! Don't forget to pack medicine - especially some Advil for your aching muscles in case you decide to participate in some of the numerous hotel daytime activities and if you are not so fit (as I was/am).Even though it might seem pricey at first the location and cuisine are first class and well worth every penny spent. Thanks!

<Content>Had a wonderful week at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana I recently spent a week with my girlfriend at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana from 1/14/04 to 1/21/04. We both had a wonderful time and it was a tremendously relaxing and fun filled week. The majority of the weather was warm (in the 80's), very sunny, and with gentle ocean breezes. One of the days, it rained for most of the day, the rest of the days were sunny. Let me review several aspects of the Iberostar Bavaro now:1) Service - was superb. In fact, this is the best service I have ever experienced. It was clear that each employee of the Bavaro was interested in doing whatever they could to help me enjoy myself, feel safe, and be well taken care of. The majority of the employees spoke both spanish and english and rarely was communication a problem. Everyone was friendly and warm. Areas where I found to service to be most exceptional were in the eating facilities and in the main lobby at the front desk.2) Food - overall, was pretty good. The selection of foods is tremendous and the variety should just about fit anyones tastes. Every day, there are several buffets to choose from for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The amount of food at these buffets is tremendous and much of it is very good. In addition, there are several specialty restaurants that serve dinner and that require a reservation. We were allowed three reservations for our 7 day vacation. We ended up using two of these reservations and ate at the Japanese and Gourmet restaurants. The food was quite good at both restaurants and the service was exceptional. Another aspect that I really loved was the vast selection of beverages to choose from. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages were in great supply and all tasted good. The drinking water also tasted good and was very safe to drink. We did not drink the tap water from our rooms, and did not need to as bottled water is provided in the rooms.3) The rooms - very comfortable, clean, and overall, nice. Lovely colors, very good air conditioning, and good water pressure. The king bed was of moderate comfort and we slept well. The room was humid even with the air conditioning, however, the humidity was not overwhelming. The housekeeping service was top notch and each day, our room was spotless after they were done. They even left flowers for us each day. The room also has a small fridge with drinks in it and it is re-filled regularly by housekeeping.4) The resort - Is very nice. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. It is a very peaceful and quiet environment. The pool is huge and I spent a lot of time swimming in the pool. There is a swim up bar in the pool. There are both shallow and deep areas. There are loads of lounge chairs around the pool. There are also more than enough lounge chairs on the beach. Speaking of the beach, it is simply georgeous. The ocean is clear, aqua blue, and the sand is white and fine. I just loved the beach and spent much of the day in the ocean and walking along the shore. Towels are provided for free and are in large supply. There are a lot of water related activities to do, however, some cost extra money. A few are free and they are fun. We also tried some of the extra money activities such as snorkling and boating. They both were enjoyable. We also recieving free lessons on scuba diving in the pool and these are available each day twice per day to those who are interested.5) Entertainment - Is in great supply and is almost too much. The main entertainment service is called Star Friends. The star friends are a group of people who are multi-lingual and who are responsible for getting people involved in various activities. There are activities for all interests such as bingo, water polo, soccer, volleyball, archery, rifle shooting, aerobics, dancing, etc....etc.....The star friends are VERY FRIENDLY and have no problem coming up to you and trying to get you involved. A lot of what they do involves them yelling into a microphone, and this can be noisy at times. If you have kids, the star friends can be helpful as they can provide children with many activies to do. Overall, I thought that they were a bit too noisy and aggressive, and would have prefered it they had less of a presence. However, it really did not lessen my enjoyment of my vacation as they were quick to leave me alone if I expressed no interest in their activities. The star friends also provide nightly entertainment and I did not pay much attention to this. There is a disco tech that is open each night, and me and my girlfriend went dancing there one night and it was a lot of fun. The disco tech is open each night from 11 PM to 3 AM is plays good dance music.So, overall, I was very impressed with the Iberostar Bavaro. I would recommend this facility to anyone looking for a relaxing and warm environment where they can swim, enjoy good food and drink, and be provided with exceptional service.

<Content>Very Happy with the Vacation My Wife and I vacationed at the Iberostar Bavaro during the week of Jan 18 - Jan 23. We had a great time and were very pleased with all aspects of the trip. We read this board many times before we left for our trip and were worried with all the Mixed reviews. But seeing it first had we side with the Very Good Reviews.We did not use the water in our rooms except for showering. We ate a little of a lot of things not a lot of one thing just to be sure we didn't get sick on anything. The Beach is Beautiful, the pool is great, the entertainment was a lot of fun, the restaraunts were above average and the drinks were good. We met some other couples and we had a fun time with them, we wished we would have been able to spend more time with but our stay was short.

<Content>Total paradise To everyone who wants to live an incredible experience of endless sand, total relaxation and magical view of the ocean, this is the place to be my friends ! Me and my close friends loved every moment of everything we came across during this experience. I recommend very well for all to live this experience. See, i am from Canada, world of the coolest sport on earth, Hockey. To play hockey you need ice so its a cold country. When i find myself in Punta Cana i go crazy with the hottest sport on earth, Volleyball. This is the best sudden exchange in sport i can ever imagine in my life and it happened. I really love the people there and everyone was having a great dream. Do not hesitate if you are looking for greatness, live this !!!

<Content>Would go again today Returned from the Ibersostar Punta Cana last week, and we all wish we were back there now. Had none of the problems seen in the reviews left by others. You need to remember you are in a poor country with people from all over the world, and not a 5 star resort, so not everyones likes and dislikes will be met. But expand your horizons, try some new food and enjoy the beautiful scenery around you and you too will have a fabulous time. Some of the highlights of our time was enjoying the beach and pool, massages on the beach (a bargain at $50USD for an hour!), and dinner at the al a carte restaurants, especially the steak house(make your reservations for them as soon as you arrive!). If you do encounter a problem with your room, go to the front desk directly (don't just call). Making an appearance with your request will get it taken care of right away. The rooms were clean and made up daily. Everyone who works there were extremely friendly and helpful. Even though most don't speak a lot of English, they usually can figure out your request or questions. If you want to participate in the different activities, sit at the pool or beach area closest to the star friends hut. We did everyday and enjoyed all the activities whether we were participating or just watching. If you want a more laid back day at the beach or pool, grab a chair at the other pool or further down the beach. We did not drink the tap water, ate everything (fruits and vegetables included) and not one of the 4 of us got any type of sick (and my 82 year old grandmother was with us!). For the price and the beauty of this resort, I would recommend it to anyone and we are already contemplating a trip back next year. ENJOY!

<Content>We loved the Bavaro We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro for 7 days (Jan 7 to Jan 14, 2004. We went with 45 people to see our daughter get married. I speak only English and I'm a meat and potatoes type guy. Some of the negative reviews has us worried.Forget the negative reviews. When you consider what you pay and what you get, the Bavaro is an absolute fabulous deal. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The beaches are incredible. The level of service is first class. Front desk staff are fairly fluent in English. Staffers that didn't speak English usually knew enough to get us what we wanted, or there was someone nearby who could help. Bavaro staffers bent over backwards to please. If you can't find food that you like then you are impossible to please. The variety, quality and quantity of food was unbelievable.I was not crazy about my daughter getting married in the Dominican Republic. I was wrong. The wedding was beautiful. They do an average of 35 weddings a month at the Bavaro and they do a super job. Their photographer (Ricky) took 129 absolutely beautiful pictures). My daughter was thrilled.The rooms at the Bavaro need renovating, but they have been very well maintained and are very clean.Some of our group got sick. Don't drink, or rinse your mouth with the tap water (I rinsed my toothbrush with hot tap water and didn't get sick). Don't eat sauces or dressings containing egg or mayonnaise. Too much heat and excess booze can also make you sick.We had a great time at the Bavaro. My wife and I both intend to go back.

<Content>Food was Atrocious Many people on our trip got really sick We just got back from IB and we will never step foot there again and probably never go back to the Dominican Republic either. We were there from 12-27-03 to 1-3-04. We went with a large group of friends and had a nice time but can't imagine how boring it would be by ourselves. We are a family of four-Adults in our 40's and kids are pre-teens. The property was nice but the rooms could use some updating. They smelled musty, had floor tiles in need of repair and the trim work was really cheaply done. The reason I said the trip would be boring by ourselves was because there is really nowhere to go outside the resort. It's not safe to venture out, rent a car or go into the town. We have traveled extensively throughout Europe, Mexico, Hawaii and other Carribean destinations and really felt trapped for the week we were there. The food was absolutely the worst I have ever experienced. Granted this was my first all-inclusive (you have no choice in the Dominican) but I could not believe the quality of the food could be so bad. Not to mention the fact that you are surrounded by the sea and can't get any fresh seafood. The seafood served was frozen and I think spoiled as many of us got very ill (some were hospitalized) at the New Years Eve Buffet where they served supposedly fresh Lobster and Shrimp. I ended up spitting out some pieces of Shrimp because they were mushy and didn't taste right. The rest of the food was quite bland. Their meat was very tough, the eggs smelled bad probably because they didn't refrigerate them so we just stuck to carbs most of the trip. After four days we had had enough. At lunch we were surviving on Nachos and popcorn. We went to two of the sit down restaurants, the Tropical and the Mediterranean and both were absolutely horrible. And by the way don't order wine it tastes like vinegar either at the restaurants or at the buffet. The service was OK except for the fact that it was very hard to communicate as no one, not even the people at the reception desk spoke English and we had to get by with the little Spanish we knew. It's hard to believe that this resort does not have a basic English program for its employees. The shopping is best to do at the hotel's Supermercado and not at the flea market on the beach where everything is priced extremely high. We found out that even after we had bargained them down, you could still find things in the Supermercado at half price. We did do a side trip to Soana Island which is by La Romana to do some snorkeling for about $75 a person. It was really a waste of money but it gave us something to do because were were so bored. They bused us to the Iberostar at La Romana which is about 1-1/2 hours away and put us on a speedboat that seats around 20 people (they said we would be on a Catamaran) and took us snorkeling (not much fish to see) then took us to Soana Island where they served us lunch which wasn't great but was better than the buffet at the IB. We then did some more snorkeling and still didn't see anything but this at least gave us a day off the resort. The resort did have nightly entertainment that was OK the kids enjoyed it and gave them something to look forward to. By the end of the trip however we really needed to go out to dinner and found a great restaurant on the beach about 15 minutes away by taxi ($3.00 per person) called Capitan Cook where we had awesome fish, lobster, shrimp etc. and were very happy to eat some good protein. I highly recommend that you try this restaurant even if you have paid the all-inclusive, it's worth it.

<Content>Wonderful place! This was one of the best resorts my family and I have stayed at. We've traveled to Mexico, Jamaica, Bahamas, and Europe--including several all-inclusives the last few years. Ages ranged from 21 to 56 and everyone felt the same.Basically, if you want a beautiful resort with nice staff and good food, this is the place. The grounds were great--as most reviews have said--but more than that was the general level of quality at the resort. I am surprised that anyone could find the food mediocre or strange. Of the five of us in my family, we all really enjoyed the food at each meal and didn't get tired of it once! The specialty restaurants were good, but the buffets really left nothing to be desired so we were fine with either. There was a huge spread of food from early in the morning until late at night--everything from homemade cakes to fruit to lamb chops to the best quesadilla bar. The coffee is spectacular (cafe con leche), which they walk around with at each meal at the more formal buffet. The staff is very sweet and keeps the place impeccable. Drinks are strong and hanging out in the lobby at night was always a great way to start. Bohemia beer is the best! The lobby is nice, as are the rooms. Air conditioning definitely works! And last but not least, the beaches are incredible with soft sand and blue water.I think if you are a relaxed person who enjoys what a tropical vacation is meant to be--sun, rest, and good food and drink--that you will be nothing short of impressed by this resort.

<Content>beautifull excellent wonderfull Husband: Just beautifull. I am originally from Curacao in the Carribean. This place is so well landscaped. The beach is fantastic. The people are very friendly. The food is excellent. I cannot rate the restaurants since I did not go to any of them. I like the buffets so I can pick just what I want. And there is plenty of whatever you are in the mood for. The landscaping, all trees, bushes, hedges and vines are kept up beatiflly it is just pretty.Wife: Well, I think this was one of the best vacations we have ever had. We have been many places; Jamaica, St. Maarten, Hawaii, Bahamas, Curacao, Europe. The people are very anxious to please. We liked the buffets, since we are vegetarians and we can see what we are getting in advance and can try a sample of everything before we fill our plates with the best stuff. The shows were fun and entertaining. The weather, great! The foiliage and wildlife, beautiful! If I had to find something that I wished was better, it is that we were on the windy side of the island, so the water was rather rough at the shoreline. We took our snorkeling gear so we could look at the tropical fish (one of my favorite things) but the water was too rough for that. I can only say, this was a WONDERFUL vacation! (Don't forget to tip these people; they work very hard for you and are poor and a few dollars means a lot to them.) Recommend that you take a bunch of one dollar bills (we took $100 singles) and a few five's (evening dinner tip). Don't forget the maid ($3-5 for maids per day). Have a great trip there!!!

<Content>A must to read this review! After reading alot of these reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. I have done alot of traveling and I have certain standards for what I want kind of resort I like to stay at. This resort was one of the BEST resorts I have been to. From the moment we arrived here the staff was so nice to us and made us feel welcome. Everything is VERY clean which is a must with me. The landscaping is gorgeous and very kept up. The pool is large and very well maintained with lush greenery surrounding it and there is NEVER a shortage of beachchairs. The rooms are nice and clean, but really, you never need to be in the rooms because all the fun is on the beach, (which after walking it, the Iberostar has the best one). Don't listen to those people who complained about the food, it was excellent, remember you are in a different (poor) counrty. The resort has speciality restaurants that have to have reservations, definatly try these. Great food, try all things exotic. Book excursions to explore the island. We did the Monster Truck Safari Tour which went into the counrty side and showed how the people really lived, it was very eyeopening and educational, and you leave feeling greatful for what you have. The Soana Island Tour was also beatiuful we heard. Don't deep sea fish if you don't like rough sea. DO NOT eat at Captain Cook's. When the guy comes and gives you the brochure just THROW IT AWAY. It is a waste of $$. (We learned the hard way)! This resort was also very accomadating to children which was nice to see. All in all Punta Cana is great and the Iberostar surpassed all expections. We will definatly be back. A word of caution, don't book right after Christmas, this is when the island experiences Christmas Winds it brings in a cool breeze and sometimes rain, but hey, make the best of it. Please feel free to email me if anyone has questions, I would love to answer them

<Content>lOVED THE IBEROSTAR BUT The Iberostar is a beautiful hotel The people who worked the desk and the help couldn't do enough for us. However, we were given a room without airconditioning and it took 4 days and a lot of phone calls to fix it. My sisters and their families had the same building and didn't have any problems. The rooms were clean and large. The grounds are beautifully mantained. The food is mediocre. I think people get quantity confused with quality. We went with 4 girls 13 to 22 years. The 13 year old had fun but she was bored at times. They don't have a game room for kids(which I think they desperately need) and they aren't allowed in the disco so this would be a great help. The beach is beautiful and clean. I would recommend this hotel but be aware that a 5 star European hotel isn't the same as a 5 star American style hotel that you might find at another island.

<Content>New Year's 2004 in Punta CAna Returned last night from a week at the Iberostar Punta Cana. Had a great time! The entire family of 14 went, with the oldest 75  the youngest 10. All enjoyed the week. It is a very large resort, sharing grounds and facilities with the Iberostar Dominicana. Rooms were large and comfortable. The hotel was immaculate, food was good but different - more european, as about 70% of the clientele is from there. We were very careful not to drink the water from the taps - just bottled water. The employees work very hard and are there at least 12 hours/day, 7 days/week (I'm not exagerrating), yet were pleasant and cheerful. The Punta Cana was quieter. The Dominicana side was more lively, as it is right next to the nightclub, where shows are held every night and are very noisy.It was a sunny but very windy week, so were unable to use the Hobie cats and other waterfront activities until the last day. Chairs by the ocean were plentiful because of the wind. Conversely, chairs by the poolside were all taken by 7:00 AM - although we were not supposed to reserve the chairs, everybody did.Took the ATV tour, which was fun, but be prepared to make three stops - once by the ocean in a beautiful place (with vendors), at a cave with a bar nearby, and at a store. I brought no extra money so was unable to buy anything. Also, candy is a good thing to bring on this trip, as the children are all trained to run out when you pass to catch it as you throw. A bit wierd. You can buy it on the trip, but it's expensive - $5 US for a small bag. On the other hand, $5 is not that much for most of us, but it means a lot to the Dominicans. This is a very poor country, as you'll realize as you drive through a small vilage.Some in our family also took a full-day land/sea trip to the south side of the island to another Iberostar resort. The day was fun but the drive was long and uninteresting.Snorkeling is not all that great. The reefs are dead, but there are some fish - you don't need to take a special trip to snorkel - you can do it right off the beach.Vendors were kept to a certain area at the end of the beach, so you don't have them harassing you. Be sure to check out the prices in the hotel lobby. The rum was sold at the hotel for 120 pesos (about $3.25 US), cheaper than at the beach market.Our family booked through Signature Vacationa flying out of Toronto and had a flawless trip. Others in the family flew out through Boston on TRW(?) and had many problems with the flight down  back. Be careful who you book with.The only negative thing I can say about the resort is that we locked our keys in the room a few times, and when we asked for another key, it was handed over with no request for our name or other identification. Anyone could ask for a key to your room. Although this did not happen to us, it made us a bit nervous. We used the room safe and kept the doors double locked at night.Al in all, it was a successful week, perfect for our varied tastes. We would highly recommend the Iberostar Punta Cana.

<Content>What a great trip My girlfriend and I went to the Iberostar the week of October 17-24. We went on the trip as a reward from my job for 15 years of tenure. We were offered a number of different vacation options but finally I decided for the Dominican Republic. This is my third trip outside the States (the first two in Cancun).I rated excellent because of the wonderful time we had. The entrance into the Domincan Republic was very smooth. We got lucky a bit because our flight arrived a little bit earlier than the others. One thing that might scare you at first when you are making the excursion from the airport to your hotel is that the roads are not that great and they drive like maniacs. Throughout the week you'll get used to it.The following were things I just really liked:1. The airport is just cool because it is so unique.2. The hotel is beautiful. 3. The room is very nice.4. The buffets are varied and plentiful.5. The beach is gorgeous.6. The bar area has a variety of liquor.7. Funjet Vacations had a top notch representative.8. Employees were great.9. Room service is available (but with a limited menu).10. Made a lot of friends from Germany, France  from the U.S.11. Got a great deal on Funjet of $959 per person for 7 days.The following are misconceptions that I read from others:1. The food is different as far as the U.S. but it is pretty good. At some points it was great. We went to one of the sister hotels for lunch one day and they were making filet mignon. The lunch buffet by the beach has a pit in which they have chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs, steak among other items. We only went to one of the traditional restaurants which was nice but I'm not really into the more formal dinner sittings.2. The rooms as far as mustiness is no different than any other sea side hotel I've been in. It is very humid and you are going to get some of that. It was the first time in a long time I did not have chapped lips because it is that humid (good side effect).3. We had very little problem with the language barrier. I know very little spanish but we had virtually no problem in getting requests answered.4. The walk from one hotel to the others is not that big of deal. Actually after eating the big buffets you should probably make the walk.5. We went to the zoo (Maniti Park) and I enjoyed it. I love zoos anyway. It was not that big but we stayed for about 3 or 4 hours. The bus ride is a little rough but once again it's just part of the experience. My favorite part was having a little monkey on my shoulder and got a picture of it.Things I missed not having:1. Ok, it was football season and I was hoping to find a tv to watch my team play and I couldn't find one. I was able to catch ESPN to see the highlights. Next fall vacation will be on a bye week.2. I wasn't that thrilled with the wine. I like lighter sweeter wines (blush  zifandel) and did not know the wine list well enough to get something comparable. So I ended up drinking a lot of rum (way too much rum).3. Punta Cana is much more of a laid back resort area than the ones I visited in Cancun. I really like the party atmosphere and though they had the discos (I don't particular care for disco) it was much more reserved and relaxing. This is compared to Cancun when people would be doing shooters throughout the day.Things I know now that I didn't know at first:1. When the sun starts to set (maybe about half an hour before it happens) make sure the insect repellant is put on. You may occassionally get a bite during the day (I didn't but my girlfriend did) but as soom as it gets dark you will get ate up.2. The hotel does not have clocks in the room which at first didn't matter to me. We didn't bring a watch but they were some activities we wanted to do and it could be a little cumbersome in keeping track with when they started. We had to either call the hotel or flip the tv on to CNN to see what time it was.3. The refrigerators in the room at first won't seem cool enough. The problem is that the cooling plates are frozen over. I emptied the contents of the refrigerator and let it thaw out for about 30 minutes and then refilled it. I did this twice and it kept the drinks much cooler.4. I like to tip my bar servers when I get good service whether it is from my local pub to the sports bar I go to on Sunday football. They get to know me if I tip well (20% or so) and I get much better service. With these guys it was very much the same but much more. The tipping is a bit different though. I asked my Funjet rep on how I should tip and she suggested that I do like a dollar every few rounds or so. She mentioned if you do it much more it would appear that you were flaunting money around.We generally followed this rule but the only different thing we did was that the bar usually had two or three bartenders. I made sure I tipped on the first or second drink that they served to each individual. Since these guys rotate job responsiblities throughout the hotel it yielded special treatment from all over.At the buffets I did not tip that much because individual service from one server is not that common. Where we did have one waiter or waitress I did leave a dollar. The maid we left $1 and nail polish along with our request for the change of drinks in the cooler. Though they said they restocked the cooler every 2 days if we left a request they would do it every day. One mistake we did was our not-so-smart move. We went for a walk around 8:00 a.m. on the beach and were gone for about an hour and a half or so but we left some cash out (about $14). We didn't expect our room to be cleaned till around 10:00 a.m. and yes the cash was taken. It was our fault because we should have known better.We didn't tip the maid for the next few days but then we saw we had a new maid and started the tipping again. A cool thing is that they pay close attention to the do not disturb signs and if we hung out in the room one day till about 12:00 p.m. went to have lunch and we took the sign off and the room was taken care of by the time we got back.5. I read a lot of things about the Jungle Safari trip but my Funjet rep suggested I do the Monster Truck Safari. This excursion took my vacation to its heighth. It was totally eye opening experience of how poor the country really is. We did bring some hard candy (though my girlfriend got into one of the bags), some pens and pencils for some of the children. We went through the town of Higuey by shuttle bus and then got on the Monster Truck. They had plenty of soft drinks, beer (not Presidente, I can't remember the name), water and rum. We traveled the county side to a traditional rural village area and visited a house. We had some traditional coffee and hung out there for about 20 minutes. We also visited a schoolhouse and gift shop (I don't care for the gift shop part, no big deal). We went from there to a cock fight place where they held a mock fight (pretty cool). We went to this secluded park area for lunch and had a traditional Domincan lunch (very good).After lunch we had a siesta to let the lunch settle down by the river. (Several movies had been shot at that sight like the Terminator - one of those type movies). The water was real rocky so you would have to have some sort of shoes you would not mind getting wet if you went in the water. It was very peaceful till it started to rain.We also visited a plantation and got to try some of the fruits that were grown. We drove through the sugar cane plantations and tried that out also. With the rain we took the ride to the extreme by going through the fields real fast and wipping the vehicle around 360 degrees in the mud. I got nailed with a ton of mud (it was great). Because of the rain and the open monster truck everybody got pretty well soaked (it was great). The last thing we did was to visit a traditional witch doctors office. This was very cool also just in not only seeing the witch doctor but his lobby where his patients were waiting. All in all I give the Monster Truck Safari an A+. It is a little more expensive than the Jungle Safari but it was well worth the experience.6. The beer at the bars wil generally serve El Presidente on draft. At some bars it is cooler than others. The Iberostar Dominicana had the coldest. But the bars will usually have 2 other domestic canned beers that are usually significantly colder than the draft beer.7. Some parts of the water in the beach have a lot of coral or rock. The beach water is very clean (limited seaweed) but I decided the first time to go into the water was at night and I went into the rocky area (not too smart). The next day when I went into the water I realized if I had gone about 20 feet from where I was the water did not have any rocky material.Thing I hated hearing the most:People saying how certain things were not like they were back home. If I wanted things to be just like home then I never would have left. Yes, the pizza is different, other foods may be different, etc. but I think that is all part of the experience.In Conclusion:I loved the trip. I would go back when the chance arrives. I love the people and the country. I loved the hotel.

<Content>Pretty darned nice This was a very positive vacation experience for us (husband, wife  4 yr old boy).The hotel: Very nice grounds and facilities. Staff was friendly for the most part, though I could tell it made a big difference that we speak some Spanish. It's pretty spread out, so be prepared for long walks between your room and the lobby, or restaurants.The rooms: Just fine. Not 5-star quality as you'd expect on a more upscale island. But more than adequate. We got two 3/4 beds instead of a King. Two people in a bed like that was pretty snug. The cleaning staff was excellent and efficient. Our room was always clean when we returned from breakfast. FYI...pay for the room safe. It's less than $1 US a day. And when you check in, ask for a remote control for the television. Otherwise, you won't have one.The beach: Gorgeous beach. Wide, clean, easy to walk...not too many people bothering you to sell stuff. The water was warm and swimmable. Two pieces of advice: if you want a chair, set your towel down early in the morning (and I do mean early). And the hotel doesn't serve any drinks (even water) in bottles or cans, so you may be disappointed if you expect it to be easy to have food and drink on the beach.The pool: I'm not a pool person, but this one was great. Large, lots of room to play..and lots and lots of shallow areas for the kids. Swim-up bar was very nice. Again, if you want a chair poolside...best to leave a towel there early. Only potential downside: lots of music and noise from various activities. If you seek tranquility, stick to the beach.The food: No better than mediocre. The main buffet restaurants serve food for the masses. Nothing better. There is tons of selection, so everyone should be able to get what they want. But it's frankly not very good. It's not bad, really...just not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. The fresh fruit is nice...especially the pineapple -- better than Hawaiian, we all thought. Make sure you get the fresh-squeezed juice in the morning. Most of the juice dispensers have processed juices. The specialty restaurants that we tried were mixed: the Caribbean was lousy, the Japanese was ok, and the Steakhouse was surprisingly very good. I recommend the ribeye there...or the salmon. Both very tasty.The activities: Lots and lots of opportunities for things to do, most of them free. They weren't very slick (that could be good or bad, depending on your preference). Tried many that were a lot of fun. There are also many excursions available. The snorkelling I did was alright, but I have seen much better. Banana boat and parasailing was the same as elsewhere, which means a LOT of fun!The nightlife: The shows/spectaculars were, to be honest, brutal. Really awful. The kids they have try hard. But unless you were under the age of 25 and/or taking very full advantage of the all-inclusive drinks, not especially entertaining. On the other hand, the singers and dancers were generally very attractive (I vouch for the women, my wife vouches for the men!). And it wasn't painful to sip on a drink and enjoy the eye candy. But it's pretty campy stuff. The casino is at the hotel next door (the Dominicana). It's small...so you may have to wait for a seat. And it's smoky when it's crowded. But still fun. The slot machines didn't appear to be very generous -- we didn't play, but sure didn't hear anyone shrieking with excitement that they won anything. The blackjack and roulette tables were fun.The crowd: Perhaps this was because we were there right over Christmas...but it was a surprisingly young crowd. Lots and lots of young families, with kids from baby right up to older teens. In all, every age group was represented, it seemed, which to us was appealing, but that may not be good for everyone. Crowd seemed split about three-ways: about 1/3 European, a little more than 1/3 from the USA, and a little less than 1/3 from Canada. There will be people who go topless on the beach. Many should not. An even greater number will wear thongs even though they're past their thong-wearing years. Ugh.The airport: A big pain in the neck, frankly. Facilities are nice for the region, but it's very disorganized. It took a LONG time just to figure out which carousel our bags were on when we arrived (actually, carousels. Our suitcases arrived on two different ones!). And we had a lot of delays on the way back -- some caused by our charter. Others by the airport. The drive from the airport is short, though. Only about 35 minutes to the hotel. And though the roads were bumpy, it's pretty easy going.FYI: If you're risk-averse, you'll be happy to know there is a very modern and proficient clinic/hospital between the hotel and the airport. So health care needn't be an issue.All in all, this was a very nice place to spend the week. It was beautiful, relaxing and fun. What it lacked in delicious food and sophisticated entertainment, it more than made up for by the beach, the pool and the gorgeous surroundings.

<Content>Brussel sprouts for Breakfast !!! My husband and I stayed at the IB 19th Nov for two weeks for a belated 25th wedding anniversary celebration. We were first put in a room with single beds 1176 then changed to a double room, after 25 years, we do still sleep together!! This room was better, we had a good maid on our block 2544, she kept the mini bar topped up with diet coke and beer. Toiletries were supplied, shower gel and shampoo were in dispensers on the wall. Our TV didn't work but after reporting it, room services brought us another within the hour. We put the TV on to catch up on news, however only CNN news for Americans, no SKY news for English. The speciality restaurants were OK but the Japanese was a joke. The buffet restaurant had a good selection but also served brussell sprouts, boiled potatoes for breakfast !!! We were warned that the food was very rich and cooked in oils that may upset our stomachs, however we both had diarrhoea most of the holiday so this limited things we wanted to do and had to make sure that there was a toilet nearby. The hotel grounds were beautiful with peacocks  ducks roaming around freely and very tame. Take plenty of books or magazines with you as you cannot buy any in the hotel. You have to put up with childrens hour on the stage in the evenings from about 8pm to 9 same old tunes every night. Went horseback riding at the Ranchero next door to the hotel, paied $30 for 1 1/2 hours along the beach, this was good fun but not very well organised. They mixed riders and non riders, I luckily can ride, thank god as there was a very over confident American family who owned their own horses at home and were obviously missing the thrill of a daily gallop ! They charged off down the beach without a second thought for people who were taking a gentle stroll along the waters edge.The hotel won't change travellers cheques into dollars only pesos, so make sure you take plenty of dollars with you as the exchange rate for pesos is bad.On the whole, not a bad holiday but wouldn't go back again, the staff were friendly but tended to favour the American guests (We met some really lovely American families) and we got tired them asking us if we were Australian so we ended up calling ourselves Bruce and Sheila.So I'll say G'day mates.

<Content>Beautiful Beach!!!!! We vacationed at IB in September and had a great time. Food was an issue for us, but we're very picky. We managed okay on the fruit and salad and saved our steak craving for home. Breakfast was super once we were able to convey what we meant by over easy. This is typical of all Domican Hotels - they serve Dominican Food. (what a surprise!) The beach is one of the best we've discovered; on a par with Negril in Jamaica. There was never a shortage of lounge chairs - in and out of the shade - by the pool or at the beach. Our housecleaner was fantabulous and rewarded our modest gift left on the first day with fresh flowers everywhere! The grounds are lovely and having to hike a bit to get to things forced us to exercise slightly without having to display our flab in the poolside aerobic class! The seemingly endless pool was delightful but needs a coat of paint sometime soon. We enjoyed the free-roaming birds and the pond fish as we strolled the property and only visited the sister properties once as our own Bavaro was superior. I've read some of the negative reports and disagree with a lot. We're not in a foreign country to have an Outback steak or a Dunkin' Donuts coffee. If we had to have the oversized, extra thirsty bath towel we'd pack one to bring. If everything had to be American we'd just stay home. All in all, compared to other hotels in D.R. this is a gem. Since we love the Dominican people so much (this was our 8th trip to their country!) we will return. They are truly the happiest, most gentle people we've met in our travels! Each time we go we bring gifts for the local children..... paper, pens, etc. Last year we took a bunch of used baseballs and tossed them to the kids from our tour bus window. They give us the best baseball players in the world so it's a good investment!! We tip everyone who serves us and say Gracias constantly. The effect of such a sweet people is that we are sweeter, too. It lasts until we get back and hit the airport traffic in Boston!! If you go please expect graciousness and comfort. Please don't expect the Holiday Inn on Miami Beach. I know you'll just love it!!

<Content>Fabulous!!!!!! After Booking a Vacation for 4, to my dismay I realized that Punta Cana was not in Mexico. So I frantically searched all information I could possibly find about this Iberostar Punta Cana. Tripadvisor was very helpful, but, after reading others personal reviews and experiences I was a nervous wreck. With much apprehension we arrived on 12/5/03. Arrival at the Airport, there were two flights arriving at the same time, everything was done in an orderly fashion and went rather quickly. Check in went well, we had wanted king sized beds, but none were available till the next day. No problem. The grounds are absolutely beautifull and very well maintained. The entire resort is practically spotless. These people work so hard here, there is always someone cleaning all areas of the resort. I never met an unfriendly worker. It seemed to me that they bent over backward to accomodate you, all within reason, of course. The food was aplenty, something to satisfy all tastebuds. There are all types of activity from spanish lessons, to dancing, arobics etc. We did nothing but relax, eat and drink and dance alittle at night. No one in our group got sick, we even brushed our teeth with the spigot water. I believe moderation is probably the key. Our rooms were very clean and we had no trouble whatsoever with housekeeping. I sometimes wonder if the people who wrote negative remarks about the place stayed at the sameplace that we did. The one thing that upset me about the trip was THAT I DID NOT BOOK FOR TWO WEEKS. Would we go back again? IN A HEART BEAT.

<Content>Fantastic Vacation We returned from a 6 day stay at Iberostar Punta Cana three days ago. We took along Pepto Bismol and Immodium as instructed by some disgruntled visitors in the past and I am glad to say we never used either. The food was excellent at the Buffets thrice daily. We ate at the Steakhouse one night and that, too, was good. The property is expertly manicured, the pools sparkling, the room was cleaned thoroughly each day and the employees were very pleasant and laid back. We breezed through the thatched-roof terminal within 10 minutes after getting our luggage and were met by VIP Travel and on bus within minutes.We are senior citizens (over 65) and found lots of folks in our age range there. We do wish we were bilingual as English was the least spoken language. Would go back again.

<Content>A usefull tips about Iberostar Punta Cana I just came back from vacation at Iberostart Punta Cana. It was very good. We're stayed there 8 days, and it was not long enough. I would like to share some usefull tips with those of you who will go there in a future. Upon arrival, ask service desk rep. to give you remote control for TV in your room, and a key for deposit box. (Deposit box cost a $1 per day). Do not call home from your cell phone. Calls to USA from Iberostar hotel cost 50C per minute without any other charges. For those of you who like good drinks: 2 Lobby bars are stocked with top shell brands. Vodka: Smirnoff and Stoli. Scotch: Dewars, Johni Walker Red Label. Gin: Beefeater and Tanquerey. You can also find some good imported brandy there. These drinks are not visible on a bar display. You have to ask for it. All other bars are serving local achogolic drinks. On Tuesdays, buffett restaraunt menu includes Japaneese Suschi. On Wednesdays, you can get small lobsters there, so do not sign for International Restaraunt on Wednesday (it serves the Lobster Dinner Only). Hope, I will go there again.

<Author>JoeandKaren
<Content>Twice in a year...Beautiful Sorry this has taken so long, but it has been a hectic few months since returning from the Iberostar Bavaro. You may have read my review of the Iberostar Dominicana from March. My wife and I ,along with our neighbors were there the first week of March '03 and absolutely feel in love with Punta Cana. I stated in that review that we loved it so much that we were considering taking our two youngest daughters(Christina-6, Caity-13) back in the summer. Well it took some time to convince my wife (not too much.), that we needed to return. BINGO. We were at the resort this time from Sat. Aug.2 thru Sat Aug. 9.PLANE TRIP: We got a great deal from our travel agent ,and this time we were able to fly out of Rochester,NY instead of Buffalo NY. That was a great selling point. Our trip in March was a charter which was great, but this wasn't too bad at all. We left Rochester 7:30 on Sat, then to Charlotte NC. We did not have much of a layover. Time to grab a bite to eat then off to Punta Cana. It was a 3hr flight from Charlotte. The plane was full but with the 2 girls there was plenty of room. We flew US Air and the flight was smooth. Karen prefers the charter out of Buffalo, 3 hours your there! But either way was fine. Its vacation! The girls flipped out when they saw airport. They had seen the pics of it but until you see it, it's not real. We were able to get some great pics of the island as we were getting ready to land. I have pics posted along with the one from the March trip. I will put the link at the end of the review.FIRST AT RESORT We , along with our travel agent and tour company (GOGO) asked for a room on the beach and for a few special things, (close to pool  ocean view). Seeing this was our second time at the resort within a 6 month period, I thought nothing of asking for special treatment. It was about 3;30-4:00 when we got to the resort and were not disappointed. The desk was well aware of our requests, and that we were returning guests. You will see in the photos, that our room was less than 50 feet from the beach. Un-freaking-believable. We were in room1296, which was in the second to the last building on the resort. The view from our patio/deck was breathtaking. Never in our wildest dreams could we have imagined such a view, and being that close to the beach and the spectacular Caribbean Sea. The people at the Bavaro Iberostar were ok, Karen liked the check in better at the Dominicana- they brought you to the room in golf carts- this time we were just given a map and told where to go. After a long day of travel I would have preferred the ride to my room instead of searching for it.Also know that this resort is huge. You will be walking a lot and we enjoyed it, but going from one end of the resort to the other which we did everyday I would figure its at least 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile if you walk the beach way.When here in March we were booked into the Dominicana, but actually were upgraded to one of the suites. The suites are really part of the Bavaro, so we were familiar with what to expect in the room. But never expected the view we had. The room was also very close to the pool. Everything was great, once we found it.I had included in my review of the Dominicana our e-mail, so if anyone had questions they could contact us. I couldn't believe how many people contacted us. I probable will have to say on the conservative side around 125 to 150 different people contacted us. I was more than happy to answer all of them. Which leads me to this.We were contacted by a couple in England about some concerns they had about the resort. Their names are Ray and Nikki . We e-mailed back and forth a few times, answering questions and sending different pics that I had not posted. We kept in touch, and then when we finally booked our trip,realized that they were going to be at the time we were too. Well let me just say, the 8 or so weeks leading up to the trip, Nikki would almost on a daily basis e-mail the weekly , then daily countdown. It was great. We also would IM them and really struck up a great friendship.Ray is in the Royal Airforce and there were times when he was in the Middle East that things got pretty scarry. Things turned out well and we met Ray and Nikki and their son Alex in the Dominicana lobby bar our first night(Sat.). It was great meeting them, they were and absolute gas(a bit of the Brit in me there). They were so kind and grateful for the info we had given them, and of what to expect. It was unexpected, but they came with gifts for our whole family, even our 2 oldest kids(Joe-16, Jen-18),who did not want to do the family trip thing. They were sorry of this fact after seeing our pics. That's another story all together. They had gotten me a print of the aircraft that Ray flys on, a Hercules C 30, and a shirt from his squadron. Some fine English china for Karen(my wife) and mom, and really cool things for the girls. But most important they brought fixings for Brandy Sours(haha). We were all pretty tired and planned on where to meet the next morning.I know that Ray and Nikki, especially Nikki check out this website often, so let me say here for all to see...Thanks to the both of you, and we are now friends forever.POOLS: On to more detail. The Bavaro pool although very nice, could really use a paint job. It is a zero entry pool, and gets very slippery around the edge as the day goes on. The Bavaro is the oldest, and the first of the Iberostar hotels. I believe they said it was 15yrs old, followed by the Dominicana(10yrs), then the Punta Cana(5yrs). The pool was fine in the morning but got somewhat crowded as the day went on. Another thing was the swim up bar. It was hard at times to get drinks( this was solved by throwing the bartenders a few dollars a couple of times) because of all the kids getting their soft drinks and stuff. Also they would be jumping into the pool right next to the bar. It was a pain at times, but after awhile someone would put a stop to it. My wife and I spoke to the manager of the Bavaro one night, and mentioned about the paint job and being slippery. He apologized and went on to say that the only way for things to get done to the pool was for there to be a hurricane. I found this kind of funny, but could see his point. The resort is packed year round, and I would hate to be the one there on vacation the week they try to paint.We really spent most of the days at the pools at the Dominicana and Punta Cana. The Punta Cana pool was really quiet, a few kids and families. After the first day we started to talk to 2 couples from Staten Island NY. Their names were Mike and Sharon, and Eric and Yvonne . They were their with their sons Mike Jr(3), and Eric(2 1/2- no mommy no mommy). They were great to meet and we want to say Hi to them as well.All in all, the 2 pools at the Punta Cana and Dominicana were much better, bigger, cleaner, and not as crowded as the Bavaro.ACTIVITIES: One morning after Nikki had mixed up pails of Brandy Sours (again..check out my pics), one of the star friends recruited myself,Mike, and Eric to be part of the Olympics on the beach. Well after a few Brandy Sours we felt more like we should be involved in the Special Olympics. We KICKED BUTT in the tug-o -war and Mike was in the waterballoon sitting event. We then formed a huge Conga line and wound our way to the pool for a victory line dance...(Dale Pa Alla..Dale Pa Acca) levantando las manos everybody. We laughed so hard my side hurt the next day.There are daily activities to participate in if you want (volleyball, dancing, bingo, etc.) but we much preferred the beach and pool activity of sunbathing but don't expect too much to do. Its defiantly not like a cruise where they have things planned all day and night. That is kind of what we like about it though, very laid back.The excursions as far as we are concerned seemed over priced and not that exciting. The Manatee Park where you can swim with the dolphins sounded appealing at first with the girls but our tour guide said they only swim 2x a day and its for all the resorts so multiply the number of resorts with kids wanting to do it and I say- forgettaboutit! Pool was fine! By the way 70.00 US dollars to do it per person.Two things not to miss are the Beach Bar-B-Que, and the Paella on the Beach. Both the Dominicana, and Bavaro have the Paella, but I believe only the Dominicana has the Bar-B-Que. Ask to find what days these are done. When staying at the Bavaro you have access to everything on the resort. Be sure to check everything out.FOOD: OK, Karen here- I am going to give you the main reason to stay at the Bavaro and have use of all resorts and its the food. After having been at the Dominicana and now seeing the difference it is well worth the extra money. Especially if you are traveling with very picky young eaters as my girls are. Now I am not saying that the Dominicana is not good, it is, but there is a much better selection at the Bavaro, there is room service at the Bavaro, and they will accommodate you if you ask. The restaurants were pretty much similar but please if you go and like seafood make sure you try the Mediterranean. (La Dorada) remember to wear pants guys or you'll have to go change. That was excellent!The Bavaro buffets at poolside for breakfast and lunch were amazing, well laid out, and had a lot of options and stations. It was like full buffets that were in the Dominicana and Punta Cana lobby for dinner, but a little better. We utilized the room service (which had chicken fingers and french fries on the menu) at least 3x for the girls and it was great, didn't take too long either. The buffet was excellent at the Bavarro lobby for dinner too. They had theme nights, Italian, Mexican, etc., and we enjoyed that.Again if your going on a limited budget and kids will eat whatever stay at the Punta Cana for the price, if you prefer better options definitely book the Bavaro.DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RESORTS Punta Cana: least expensive, but newest rooms like normal hotel rooms limited access to other areas for drinks and food -can only get drinks at Lobby bar or by steakhouse addition coming that will have family style suites- looks nice nice and clean Say hello to Eladio in Lobby bar- he is great!Dominicana: People are the friendliest here, we really like the workers that are here and they actually remembered us from March! That was amazing! Mohammed at the beach bar is awsome! Remembered our names- Hows that for service! Can drink in Lobby bar of either Dominicana or Punta Cana or at both pool side restaurants Can upgrade to a suite and well worth it Area's are extremely clean Lobby has the Casino Entertainment here nightlyBavaro: All Suites Food is excellent Service was ok, still liked the Dominicana for service too! Access to all bars, restaurants and buffets in whole resort Entertainment nightly in lobby areaThings to know: There are shuttle carts available from lobbies of Dominicana and Bavaro- I am sure they probably are available from Punta Cana too. Well worth a couple bucks tip at night with a tired child! Just ask at desk for them they will direct you.All in all we love the resort. We want to try the Mayan Riviera in Mexico next and will stay at the Iberostar. But dollar for dollar you can't beat the price of the Dominican Republic, and I am sure we will return again.Any questions feel free to contact us and be sure to check out the photo's. joeferr@rochester.rr.com http://community.webshots.com/user/joeferrari

<Author>helaurin
<Content>Enjoyable  Reviewer's background: Couple in early 40's. First time in Dominican Republic; have travelled previously to Aruba (2x), Jamaica (2x), St. Lucia, St. Thomas and Tortola (BVI).Our visit: 11-22 to 12-02. (11 days, 10 nights).Pre-Departure: We planned for most contingencies, based on reviews we'd read. Everything from having our own snorkeling gear  lots of suntan lotion, to umbrellas, rain ponchos and medicines for typical traveler's illnesses.Airport: Typical developing Caribbean airport. You exit via a transportable stairway to the ground, walk a short way to get into the palm-roofed buildings. Pay $10 U.S. per person for a tourist card. You get your photo taken with a couple of local ladies in costume; you can purchase it ($6) if you want it when you are leaving the country. Officials check your paperwork. If you don't have a passport, be sure to have a certified copy of your birth certificate, your photo driver's license, and if your name is different between the two, proof of name change (marraige, etc.). Don't be surprised that they stamp your birth certificate as if it was a passport. Eventually you find your luggage, and begin looking for your transportation.Transport to Hotel: Ours was with Pietro Tours, arranged by Liberty Travel. The bus was okay; it was air conditioned, etc. One warning: it seems that most of these busses have very narrow aisles. Although I made it through the aisle okay, I did see someone else had a bit of difficulty. My suggestion is that if you are significantly wider than average (whether it's muscle or fat isn't the question, it's a question of logistics), you might want to get on the bus sooner rather than later and grab a front seat.Hotel Check-in: We had requested a quiet location on the resort, as my spouse has several medical issues, including sleep disorders and auditory perception disorder (he can hear things that most people can't hear. Sort of like being far-sighted, except it's with his hearing.) So we were very disappointed when at checkin we asked if the room we were being given was quiet, and the employee said not so quiet, no. Of course, we were told no other room was available, so could we please take a look at it? We did; and unfortunately we could hear a screeching noise coming from the kitchen area which grated on our nerves. We went back to ask for another room and found a different staff member, named Wander. Eventually Wander found one which was in the area we had wanted to be in anyhow; it hadn't been marked as available because the people in it had left late and it hadn't been cleaned. He offered to have it cleaned within the hour and our bags moved for us, which we happily took him up on. The room was perfectly located in building 171.The room: Our room was clean, decently sized, and generally well taken care of. I constantly saw maintenance people taking care of repainting other buildings, working (quietly) on landscaping, etc. We apparently had two different maids during our stay. The first one was very good. I gave her a $5 tip a couple days into our stay. Over the weekend though, we apparently had a different maid. On one day, 11-29, we had the door-hanger sign outside to please make up the room. It was out there for the entire day, and the room was not maid up. Around 5 pm, we saw one of the housekeeping staff walking by, and asked her to rectify the situation. She restocked our toiletries and made the beds, but didn't sweep up or mop anything. So housekeeping staff varies in quality. As far as mustiness in the room, we didn't notice any. I had brought some candles in case there was a mustiness, but we didn't notice any. Also saw no bugs either; but we were in a second-floor room. Yes, the a/c does shut off if you are out of the room, but it apparently comes on for about 10 minutes out of each hour while the room is unoccupied. So the room was never a problem at all. One other thing: calling home from the D.R. was surprisingly cheap. We made several calls during the daytime, and it was about $4 total.Food: There was always enough food to be found. Regarding other reviewers reporting flies, please remember that in most cases you are eating in open-air restaurants or buffets. (A few restaurants were not open air: Japanese, Mediterranean, and Gourmet). Use common sense. We went to the buffets earlier, rather than later, so the food wasn't sitting out for long. Items that were getting frequently replenished are often a better choice than something no one is eating and that is sitting around for a couple hours. The Japanese restaurant's a/c was broken when we went (but other said it had been broker all week too.) We liked La Ballena. The steakhouse was okay, although portions were small. The Japanese wasn't truly authentic, but it was still okay. Better than the Mediterranean restaurant, in any event.The Staff: In general, they are quick to try to satisfy your requests, and work hard. However, many do not speak much English; it helps if you have thought to bring a small Spanish-English dictionary. That said, all the lobby staff do speak English and most of the bartenders speak English to some degree. The English skills of the waiters and waitresses varies tremendously, from not-at-all to nearly-fluent. Just remember, it is a Spanish-speaking country, you are a visitor, and if you are patient, they will try to figure out what you are trying to convey.Drinks: Drinks were definitely not top-shelf liquors. If you are a lover of white zinfadel wine, you better bring it with you, as the IB doesn't have any. That said, after a few drinks, you start to notice the quality a bit less. After a few more drinks, you couldn't care less about which brand of rum, gin or whiskey was being used. The bartenders can make a variety of basic drinks, but not a very extensive list. Example: I asked for a hurricane; none knew what it was nor could make it.The pools: We mostly stayed on the Bavaro's site, but did visit the adjacent Iberostars. The pools are generally nicely designed. The beachy edge can sometimes be a little slippery, but I didn't see anyone fall. Two drawbacks to the pools: The water seemed colder to me than it should be, and there was no jacuzzi or hot tubs nearby or adjacent. To me, the coolness of the water was a problem; I want to be able to go into the water without having to feel like I need time to adjust to it. If I had to give any one reason that would deter me from revisiting this resort, this would be it. Nor was it only the IB; I spoke to people at other resorts, and they had the same issue.The resort does have a couple of jacuzzi's, but they are at the fitness center/spa, and are only accessible through them and during their opening hours. This is the first Caribbean trip where we didn't have easy access to jacuzzi's. As a personal preference, this was an issue for me.Regarding finding palapa's and chairs, we never had a problem, regardless of if we hit the pool or beach at 9 am or 1 pm.The beach: They clean it twice daily. It's a good sand beach; not pristine white, but not like the sand on the Jersey shore either. Also never had a problem finding lounges or chairs here either. The water was a bit rougher than I like it, but that's a matter of personal taste. Don't expect to snorkel and find a lot of fish; my husband saw some, but not much. There are vendors down the way selling art, jewelry, crafts, knickknacks, cigars and cigarrettes. Their prices vary, and whether you'll spend more than something is worth will depend on your negotiating skills. We priced some artwork that we could find both there and in the IB gift shop; the artwork was essentially the same. The IB gift shop's price was about $10 U.S.; the beach vendor tried an opening gambit of $42 U.S. His final offer was $20; we still bought it at the IB gift shop. However, the vendors do have a wider variety than the IB gift shop.Excursions: We did a few things. An ATV-Quad 1/2 day drive; a trip to Saona Island; and I went horseback riding. The ATV Quad drive was NOT fun for me; I was on the same unit as my spouse. I kept getting rocked back and forth. During the trip, one tire went flat and they had to pump air into it. The roads are generally not too good, so we were hitting (or narrowly missing) a lot of pot-holes. We stopped at a roadside stand, were we were encouraged to buy candy to toss to children who line along the streets; a cave where some people went swimming; Macao beach - which was a nice beach, but the kids kept trying to get us to buy coconuts; and a small artists' stand. One word about the kids - they kept trying, and I kept saying no, I'm not interested, I really don't like coconuts. Finally one of the older youths flat out said show me your money, and my husband had to get stern with him. Enough about the ATV ride (which we would never repeat if we went back). The trip to Saona Island ended up being a really fun time. The ride by bus to the speedboat was longer than we given to expect. Once past that, however, we went on a catamaran, had beer and/or rum, went to this beautiful small island, swam, snorkelled, had lunch, etc. It was a good trip. We ended up buying a DVD-format video of the trip, which gave us some extra laughs once we got home and saw it. This cost $80 each; worth it. Regarding horseback riding, I had a relatively decent horse. There's a stable right next to the IB which offers mountain rides in the morning, and beach rides around sunset. I did the sunset beach ride. Unfortunately, the rest of the group included everything from an 8 year old girl screaming and crying that she didn't want to be on a horse, to some pretty expert riders, and it was a large group. The guides had a hard time handling a large, diverse group. Eventually we were split into two groups, but our 5:00 ride didn't start until about 5:45. For those of us who wanted to ride longer to make up for the late start (and a detour to return screaming 8 year old back to the stables), the stable did let us go back out and ride an extra 30 minutes or so. In short, after a false start or two, it turned out to be fairly fun, and worth the money ($30) spent on it. We also went do dinner off the resort one time, to Capitan Cooks, which was also quite nice.Other: We didn't get sick, although since I was eating more fruits and vegetables than normal, I did notice some differences, if you know what I mean. There were others who did get sick; I don't know what they ate though, or how sensitive they are in general. Dollar tips do go a long way, although I saw some people who didn't tip at all, and I saw someone tip a bartender $20. Give what you feel is right.The resort is large, be prepared to do a lot of walking. It's also quite pretty, well maintained, with peacocks and various interesting fountains and bird areas. For those looking for the mini-zoo, it's gone, but no one's updated the literature yet.Topless women, men in little speedo's - yes there were some. Didn't make a difference to me. There were a lot of kids, but it was Thanksgiving week too. One thing I saw I didn't like: some parents thought it was okay for their kids to go about the pool area entirely nude (I'd say the ages of the kids ranged from 2 to 8), which I hadn't expected.Alcohol  cigarettes are very cheap in the gift shop, about half of what you would pay in the U.S. However, suntan lotion is about triple, so bring enough of that.Star Friends, activity leaders: they work hard at what they do and generally do a passable job at it. Regarding the shows, they rotate the shows so there's a different one each night of a week. Some shows are better than others, according to your own preferences.Exiting the country: Be prepared for someone to go through your luggage, sometimes more than once, before you get on your plane.The weather: We got lucky - we had great weather the entire time. A week after we left, they got hit with a tropical storm. So it's a bit of hit or miss, but try to avoid the obvious hurricane/rain season (May - October).Summary: We had a good time, ate and drank plenty, had great weather, a room we liked, made some new friends, tried some of the excursions. We'd consider returning again in the future, although it didn't take number one in my list of where we've been. (It's also not in last place, but right in the middle).

<Content>Beautiful resort We visited over Thanksgiving week, and I must say that my family was worried about this vacation after reading some of the previous posts. The Iberostar Punta Cana has beautiful grounds and beach. They are also just finishing a brand new section. Perfect place if you are looking to relax! I did tell my family to try this as an adventure vacation- not knowing what to expect in this foreign country. The staff is awesome- you are really taken care of. We did watch carefully about not drinking any tap water and not to eat too much of any one thing. The buffet was fine- we loved the breakfasts and always found something at the other meals- part of the adventure. My daughter did get sick one evening after having shrimp- but besides that and 'adjusting' again to US food after being home- we were OK. My husband and teenage son did the 4 wheeler Quad excursion and loved it. (Note: you can get a cheaper price directly from the Quad reps instead of going through your own tour rep.) The entire family did the Marinarium and enjoyed that also. I heard of other couples and families that liked other excursions- and would highly recommend them- (James Bond aquatic speed boats, Bavaro Runners) Our only BAD part of the vacation was using Prieto Tours. This was something that our travel agent assigned and we did not know how it would affect us. As it turned out, Prieto only has one rep and he spends just 1 hr in the morning and 1 hr in the afternoon at the resort. We didn't connect with him until late in the trip and he was the ONLY unfriendly person that we came across all week. Cutting the story down- the shuttle from the hotel back to the airport on our departure- never showed! Even after calling for it again- a no show. We finally got a taxi and arrived at the airport being told that the gate was closed. We did argue and just made the flight.  Overall this was a great vacation. We had perfect weather (just after hurricane season was over) and my teenagers were exposed to people of many different cultures.

<Content>IMO not 5stars.... The resort was labeled 6 Apple by AppleVAC and 5 Stars by whoever...IMO it was neither...but it was nice and we enjoyed our stay...went last year to Secrets, also in Punta Cana and it WAS definitely a 6 and 5. The Bavaro was several steps below. The accomodations were nice and roomy, but did have a musty odor..very clean. The food was good and they certainly have a variety of restaurants...The restaurants were not totally authentic...but, note you are in P.C., not USA or Europe....beach was very nice...grounds beautiful, with lots of tropical birds. Staff was great, especially Radu, the Apple Rep. The bars were well stocked, but did not serve American whiskeys...the wine was ok. I would go back!

<Content>Loved it My husband and I went to DR with our 14 year old daughter and we all had a wonderful time. Best vacation yet. The rooms were very nice and clean. Staff was perfect. Some do not speak english at all, but there is always someonce close by who does-that was never a problem for us. On Thanksgiving they made turkey's. Being American, we really appreciated the dinner. What a nice touch. My daughter and I are very picky eaters, but we had a no problem finding food we liked there. The buffets are huge and honestly have something for everyone. The grounds are spectacular and so clean. The beach is beautiful and the pools are great, too. We had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend this resort to others. We will hopefully be going back. One odd thing that happened to my husband and I....one morning we both woke up with a black tongue. We were not feeling sick so we didn't worry about it too much-not sure where it came from, but we were able to brush it off with a toothbrush. Came back a second day and then we never saw it again. So, if this happens to you, do not panic-you'll be fine.....or at least, we were. Think maybe the Pepto Bismal we were taking had something to do with it-but don't really know. They had many activities for everyone all day-you could keep busy if you chose too. We liked to relax and lay in the sun. It really was perfect. Evenings, they had shows in the Dominicana. Very entertaining and fun for everyone. So, as you can see, we LOVED our vacation at the Iberostar Punta Cana!!!!

<Content>Paradise! Let me start out by saying that overall my trip was EXCELLENT. I had the pleasure of staying at the Iberostar Bavaro and the grounds were gorgeous and clean. Staff was SO GREAT....although there was a language barrier at times, most spoke english and were very eager to make you comfortable. I did get married on my vacation and the ceremony outside was GORGEOUS!!! The only thing I would do differently is to have the dinner at a different restaurant. La Ballenna is not the greatest HOWEVER the steak house, the Japanese restaurant and the seafood restaurant were GREAT!! Make reservations to early in your trip to secure yourself a spot. Buffets are also good so don't be impatient when you are not used to the food. It's all good! Rooms were a nice size and always clean. I can't say enough except that I would definitely return to this property.

<Content>Had a great time but would not go back We were at IB Bavaro for Thanksgiving weeekend (5 nights). We read every review on this site prior to going so we were well prepared mentally hoping for the best, ready for the worst. The outcome was in the middle. The 5 star standard is Dominican standard. Just like their beer or wine, so take that into consideration. Their red wine is slightly stronger than grape juice. Dont expect the 5 star Bellagio Buffet style, or ANY Las Vegas Buffet for that matter. FOOD: Quantity is definitely plenty, never a shortage of food you can eat if you dont care about the quality. Quality though, is another story. Plenty of choices so every type of dieter will have at least 1-2 type of food they can eat. If you are all American style, junk food + tons of carb, you are in heaven; if you are on Atkins, there are plenty of meat; if you are low carb  low fat  on Perricone diet for your skin, you have just about enough variety to fill your stomach, though there wont be salmon at every meal. There are always veges  fruits on the table, which is wonderful. HYGIENCE: Ive seen at least 6 flies simultaneously on one buffet table. Sometimes flies flying around from table to table. But I never got sick from the buffet. Now the SPECIALTY RESTAURANTS: we tried Japanese, Mediterrinean, and the Gourmet. JAPANESE restaurant was the biggest joke ever. Whoever said their Japanese food is good have no idea what Japanese food should be like. IB Bavaro used the wrong rice to begin with. I understand things can be different in a different country. But, if you CLAIM to be Japanese restaurant, then you have to do it right. Otherwise its a fraud. My chin dropped when I saw their maki rolls. It was just wrong. So we ordered sashimi, thinking, its just plain raw fish, how wrong it be? Well, the salmon was simply non-sashimi grade. The glow on the fish was not there and the fish smelled bad. It was obvious that fish was not fresh. The only way the fish can be eaten raw is when its fresh. I didnt dare to touch it fearing diarrhea. So I had 3 bowls of Miso soup, which was the only thing authentic because you can make it using instant miso soup mix. Then their made a mistake with our main course, they told us that before they brought the dishes over. At this time we just called it a night. We left without eating our main course and went to the buffet instead. MEDITERRINEAN: They forgot our order. Enough said. And I got my first diarrhea after that meal. The specialty restaurants are always half empty when you get there. I understand why because they even forgot our order/made mistakes on our order when the place was half empty, can you imagine what will happen when it is packed?? SERVICE: The people there are friendly and hard working all the time. However, my observation shows that if they use their brains a little better, they will increase their efficiency much better and therefore wont have to work constantly. Example, one morning at breakfast, as soon as I got up to get something else like a juice or some fruit, when I came back, my fork, knife, glass are gone. So I got up 3 times, they took them away three times and hence had to set 3 times. So at times you wonder if its just plain language barrier or low intelligence. AMENITIES: First day at the resort, we had no hot water. We called the maintenance who never came. The following days for some reason the water was back up. So it could be the water pressure maybe 90% people on the resort were taking shower between 6-7pm. The rooms are very clean, although I agree with other reviews, that the rooms have shown some wear  tear. There was a big crack in between the top of our door and the door frame. Weve never seen roaches but tiny little ants are plenty. We were lucky that the weather has been perfect, mid 80s everyday so A/C being turned off when we were out was never an issue. BEACH: Ive seen better. Its been windy so the shore has been pretty wavy. I was told its because of geographical reasons, the Caribbean side is more calm. Ive seen also more turquoise beach  whiter sand. The sunrise was breathtaking. Must see. A lot of topless women lying/walking around, some grandmas too, which is interesting although gross at the same time because most of them need a boob job reduction or lift or implant. ACTIVITIES: Snockeling, we didnt see much but still enjoyed floating in the ocean. Ive done better snockeling in Cancun. AIRPORT: worse than a greyhound bus station. This is where you really feel that you are in a developing county. They open everyones bag before boarding even after you go through their X-ray. In summary, the beach is nice, resort is good for the most part. You can find the same thing in a more civilized and developed country.

<Content>Great Vacation We just got back in October from the resort. I and my wife have visited DomRep in 14 different ocassions and this resort has been one of the best up to now. The service, food, facilities and rooms were excellent. The only thing that we both recommended was the implementation of a shuttle bus system on the premise. We both recommend this resort for a relaxing vacation. The atmosphere is very relaxing and we never found any loud crowds. The beach is great, topless for those that participate and for the kids they really go all out to take care of them. Next year we plan to travel with our daughter and son in law and our grandson. I am sure they will enjoy the trip and our grandson will become part of the childrens show which takes place each evening. We surely recommend the resort to all.

<Content>A great place to relax We used apple tours, and from the minute you clear customs a rep is there to show you where to go. As far as the resort is concerned, we can't say enough good things about it from the friendly people working there to the manicured and well kept garden areas.even on the beach, if you put an emty glass down on the sand there is a person there to pick it up.The food wasn't bad and there is more than you could ever eat at one sitting.Of the restarants there , we enjoid the steakhouse the best. We were left fresh flowers in our room every day by the maid and as many towels as we needed, not to mention an imaculate room before we got in from the beach.If we can ,we will be back next year.

<Content>Loved the grounds with plenty to do! OK, I want to start fro the begining...First off, when you arrive at the airport you will think you are at a Tiki Hut! It has a strwa roof and no walls! Weird place but fun! I would recommend using the restroom before you get off the airplane too. The bathrooms at the airport are dirty with no AC and people can smoke in the. It took about 20 min. to get through customs. The ride to the hotel was about 45 minutes (that's with dropping other people off at other hotels). The lobby was beautiful, there are no walls anywhere in the hotel except at the Mexican restaurant . In the center of the lobby was a pond with fish and turtles. Check in was slow, we waited about 1-2 hours for our room but it was no problem. We hung by the bar and walked the grounds and they kept our luggage and took it to our room when it was ready. Everyone was very helpful and tried their hardest to please us. The grounds were beautiful too. There were all sorts of birds walking around. The flamingos were cool. They will bite you if you put your hand out to them..I got bitten but it didn't hurt..it was just kind of shocking. Our first excursion was the Marinarium. It was great! Very fun and when you get to swim with the sting rays and sharks, take your life vest off so you can swim down to actually touch them! We also took the OutBack Safari excursion....GREAT!! You have to do this. They show you all the Beaustiful land of Punta Cana and they take you to a dominican home. Tony was our tour guide and he was great! Tell him we said hello, cousin! At the end you go to the beach and learn how to boogie board.  Back at the lobby bar: Marcelo is an excellent bartender. He also sings for you! I asked him if he knew any Selena songs and busted out in toon and sang me the whole song...we did tip him too.  Drinks: they are sweet and not very great, but will get you drunk if you want to. They also don't know to make many different things, but it's all good.  Food: could have been better...at first I didn't ind it, but after 6 days of the same thing, you are ready for american food again. The mexican restaurant was fab. We ate there twice. The international restaurant was not that great...I could have done without it.  Getting Sick: This did happen to me. I must have eaten something bad...maybe the mussels that I scarfed down, but I don't really know. I ws very ill and threw up all day and had to go see the doctor where I got 2 shots and almost passed out. I spent all day in my room sleeping. The next day I felt soo much better. I couldn't eat normal for days afterwards.  Beach: Beautiful, palm tree lined. Gorgeous water!  Activities and Star Friends: We kept reading that the star friends were getting fresh with the women, but I think people were being paranoid. I never once saw this in any way. They were all very nice and courteous. The actvities were all day long too. You could never be bored here. We also got a massage on our last day...$20 for 35 minutes and it was very good!  Horseback riding: this was located on the edge of the hotel beach. We did the sunset riding on the beach . It was raining for about 20 mintes of the tie, which sucked. But what sucked more was that I had a slow horse and when all the other horses took off to run, they would kick up wet sand into my face and eyes. I would recommend the country side riding. Also, to let you know, the horses are very malnutritioned. Their bones are sticking out a lot.  The Room: was very large with a seperate sitting area and very clean. Leave the maids little gifts and she might leave you chocolates and will put flowers on your towels and give you extra towels if you ask for them. I would leave her a note asking for extra towels...you have to write the note in spanish though, they know NO english.  The weather: said it would rain every day and it rained 2 out of 7. Most the tim it rained for a short time and then moved on. But it is very humid...if you have curly hair...take a good gel! I have curly hair which I always keep straight...well not there! Just to let you girls have the heads up! I think that's all I can think of to wrote now. If you have any questions for me about the hotel or the place in general please email me!

<Content>not worth the money just returned from resort 11/15//03 thru 11/22/03. we travel alot and found the resort to be one of our worst vacations. the food was terrible. you must be very careful about what you eat there. we are in the food business. we saw so many health violations that i couldn't possibly list them all. we talked with several guests while there who were ill from the food. two of which had to seek medical help. the room we had was damp and musty. it was in need of renovation. the grounds, pool, and the beach were all great. the help was ok if you tipped them. overall i would rate this resort a 2 out of 5. not worth the money by no means!!!!!!!

<Content>Better than expected The first comment I have is that using Apple Vacations is definetly the way to go....with Apple we received first class treatment. The resort is beautiful. The rooms were great. Top shelf liquore! The (buffet) food was very good. The restaurants were great. We had excellent meals at the Japanese restaurant, the steak house at the Dominican was great, you eat outside on the beach. The gourmet restaurant at Bavaro was fantastic. The steak house at the Bavaro was very good. Making reservations was sometimes a problem, but if you show up at the time you want to go they usually seat you. One problem that my wife and I had was that all breakfasts are buffet style....there were days when we wanted to sit down and be served. My wife had an accident the week before we went. She had a removable walking cast on hr left foot, but we coped with this problem. The hotel gave us a wheel chair so I could wheel her around, after all everything is a bit far from where your room is. They also let us have our room until the bus took us to the airport. Check out time is 12:00 p.m., they let us have our room until 4:30. p.m. My son and I went snorkling and speed bout racing....I rate this a 10! Also my son went skuba diving for (2) days....he had a great time. Bring one dollar bills with you for tipping, a few dollars here and there goes a long way. Also, I was given discounts for paying cash for larger items. I saved $25.00 by paying cash for my my sons skuba diving classes. The people are very pleasant....there are a lot of extremely good looking women walking around, some topless! The beaches are great, the pool area is great. For you people that smoke, a carton of cigarettes, any brand will cost you between $10.00 and $15.00. I would also say that only about 10% of all the guests are American. You are given plenty of bottled water for your room and all the water used at the hotel for drinking is purified. We flew USA3000, great flight. I would reat this vacation as one of our best. I would also go back, and stay at the same hotel.

<Content>Nice Vacation Just got back from a week stay at the Iberostar Punta Cana. The overall vacation was great. Iberostar is not a 5 star hotels by any means, but there are a lot of things to do and enjoy. The grounds are nice and maintained very well. The pool was lovely, although there's no pool bar. The beach and the ocean were beautiful; we never had problems getting chairs even in the middle of the day. There are many day / nighttime activities. During the day, I recommend trying the banana boats; it was a fun experience. At night there's a small casino, a disco, and a couple of fun bars. The food was mediocre. There are 4 gourmet restaurants and 1 buffet restaurant. The breakfast buffet and the specialty Mexican restaurant were excellent. As far as the other restaurant, they were decent, don't expect much. The best part of our trip was the excursions. I would defiantly recommend the quad safari. The trip was a lot of fun and we got to see the villages, different beaches, countryside, and swim in a natural water cave. The worst part of the hotel was the rooms. The rooms were extremely muggy, there are leaks in the ceilings, and aunts are crawling around everyone. Other than that we had a fun and very relaxing trip.

<Content>AMAZING!!!! We just got back from iberostar punta cana and it was just amazing. Everything was perfect, the people there were so friendly and i met so many people half from the dominican and half from the states. the food was good but since it was so different from what i am used to i got sick but only for like 2 days. and we went on a safari trip through the jungle and the rainforest and got to visit a family that lived in the village, it was $75 but it was worth every penny because that $75 and everyone elses went towards the families to help them have clean drinking water etc. but the trip overall was just excellent and im already planning another trip to go back but for longer!!

<Content>Iberostar Bavaro We visited Iberostar Bavaro a week of November 8/03. The accomodation and food is above average. The sorroundings are very nice and staff is very friendly.The biggest problem we found was that a great majority of staff does not speak English, including some who work at the reception. Not a big problem only an inconvenience.Watch out for Punta Cana Airport!!Still we would recomend this property.

<Content>Beautiful grounds! Very nice hotel and grounds. Plenty of room for children to sleep. Generally you only paying more money for bigger room and bar has some better liquor, but you have to ask for it! Maybe this hotel littel less crowded. Pillows could be better. Lots of food variety. Ocean is not quite. We were in November and it was windy. We were lucky and it rained only at night. Staff is frendly. Tipping at the frond desk will not buy you better room! Save your money.Warning! Do not buy trip protection Avok from Apple and VacMart. It is a scam. They only give you certificats for your next travel. Bad choice!

<Content>Love the Iberostar Bavaro I have been to Punta Cana 4 times in the last 2 years and 3 of those times I have stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro and cannot say enough good about this resort. Two out of the 4 times, I have been on vacation alone, and feel completely safe. All of the staff are excellent and would do anything to please a guest. Language is no problem, because the majority of staff speak 5 or more languages. If you like to stay busy, you can. If you like to do nothing, you can. The choice of food is excellent and prepared and arranged wonderful. Stay at this location for a terrific vacation. Because of the great people of this country, I am checking into retiring here one of these days.

<Content>Could be Perfect...if My wife and I spent our 7 day honeymoon at the Iberostar Bavaro, Dominican Republic Oct 20 through the 27th, 2003. We have vacationed many times in the Carribean including Cozumel, Aruba, Bahamas, Turks and Cacos, and the Virgin Islands. This was our first stay at an all-inclusive. We stayed in a junior suite.Although Apple vacations rates the Bavaro as five golden apples, our over-all opinion is that this scale is a little inflated. Most everything (room, facilities, service, food, pool, beach) lived-up to the five golden Apple rating, however, there were a few things that kept us from achieving the five golden Apple vacation we were hoping for. You may want to consider the importance of the following issues to you when vacation shopping. Read On!First of all, air conditioning. Expect it to be minimal and non existent in most places at the Bavaro. As you probably have read in other reviews, the suites are rigged with motion detectors and door switches. Leave your room for more than a couple of minutes and your power is automatically switched off, most notably, the air conditioning and mini-bar, but also the lights. Thus your room is always warm and humid when you return. I think this was more of a problem because our air conditioner was not terribly efficient and it took a long time (30 to 60 minutes) for the room to cool down again, each time we returned. The humidity never seemed to leave no matter how long we were in the room. I'm sure controlling the power is a nice cost-cutting, ecological thing to do, but it was an inconvenience we did not expect from a five golden apple resort.Along those same lines, don't be surprised to be uncomfortably warm in the restaurants. The Gourmet restaurant (La Ballena) was fine, good air conditioning and it was top notch dining experience all around, however, the steak house is open-air. If it werent for the slight ocean breeze the night we ate at the steak house, our dining experience would have been miserable. We know this because we ate at the similarly open-air tropical restaurant (La Marimba) two nights later. It is difficult to enjoy a meal when sweat is running down you face. It just seemed ridiculous to us that the Bavaro would go to such obvious effort to present a near gourmet dining experience in all aspects and expect you to enjoy it sitting in a puddle of your own sweat. Two words for the management Ceiling Fans in both restaurants, lots of them. We were similarly uncomfortable when we ate at the Mexican restaurant. Although it was an indoor facility, we were told that the air conditioning was broken that night. This again put a damper (no pun intended) on an otherwise really nice dining experience. We also ate at the Rock Caf茅. Good food, good service, good air conditioning!Same story with the Casino. Poor ventilation (smoke filled) and poor air conditioning. We spent a couple hours each night in the casino. The heat and smoke really distracted from what would have been an otherwise pleasant gaming experience. I asked a couple of times to turn down the temp a little, with no success. I know it wasnt just me because they had floor fans placed throughout the casino and most gamers were dripping. The fans helped a little but it seems like a silly cost cutting measure for such a lucrative activity for the resort. Note to the management: You are encouraging people NOT to spend time and money in your casino!Since we are on the subject of comfort, Id also like to talk about the policy of requiring long pants at the above mentioned restaurants. Long pant are for cold climates and air conditioned buildings. Not outdoors in the tropics! Considering the discussion above, you can probably understand why we did not appreciate this policy. And dont try to sneak-by wearing shorts. I tried this. I was wearing nice (new) Bermuda shorts, a (new) button down shirt, a belt, and shoes (not sandels) and was promptly told I needed to return to my room (in the pouring rain, no less) and put on long pants. No exceptions! If long pants at meals are needed to achieve five golden apple status, well try a four golden apple resort next time.Ok, lets talk about the all inclusive part of the beverage service. You can have all the beer you want, anytime you want it, as long as it is Presidente Beer! There are no choices. By the way, Presidente beer is terrible. I tried real hard to develop a taste for it. I was unsuccessful after seven days. Just as a point of reference, I normally enjoy Bud Light, but also enjoy-dark beers. Presidente tastes nothing like either. Two words for management domestic beers for domestic guests. At least maybe a choice of light, dark or regular beer would be better. If beer is important to your vacation, try another resort.We were thrilled and excited to here a rumor that the Mexican restaurant offered Corona beer with the meal. We looked forward to it after drinking our share of Presidente. Unfortunately, like the air conditioning that night, they were all out. But they had lots of Presidente!How about wine? Here you have TWO choices, red and white. And of course all you want of the hous wine, no problem. The same house wine is served everywhere. Now, I do appreciate good wine but Im not a wine snob and standard box wine (Almenden or Franzia) is completely adequate to me. However, the swill they serve as their house wine is absolutely horrendous. Luckily, I learned that at some of the restaurants (not all) you can ask for alternate wines. At the LaBallena, the wines on the alternate list were included at no extra charge. At the tropical restaurant, I had to buy separately. I was very happy to spring for the 230 pesos (about 7 dollars) for a bottle of other-than house wine to salvage the dining experience. Bottom line, if wine is critical to your dining experience, be sure to ask if they have an alternate list.How about mixed drinks? Yes they offer SOME fine, top-shelf alcohols such as Tangqerrey, Dewars, and Absolute. However, they offer one kind of tequila and one kind of rum and these were very much off-brands. The rum was tolerable, but the tequila was paint thinner (and I normally like tequila and Mezcal!). Unfortunately, this made their margaritas taste unusual. Also, you better enjoy martinis or scotch on the rocks, because all their mixers (soda etc) taste very unusual. Many times the mixers were flat. Coke didnt taste like Coke, 7-up didnt taste like 7-up and forget about getting tonic that tastes anything like Swepes or Canada Dry.Unfortunately, we had similar experiences with their tropical drinks. I think the problem here was that they dont seem to use fruit juices, just sugar and flavoring. Its kind of like the difference between drinking Tang verses real orange juice or grape Kool-Aid verses real grape juice. This applied to their pina coladas, screwdrivers, and their margaritas. Extremely sweet and sugary. No blenders. They have slush machines which dont always get cold enough to get slushy. If you order a tropical drink, be sure to ask for it with alcohol if you want alcohol, otherwise youll get it virgin. Also, always ask for a side of ice in a glass. Youll need it to keep your drink chilled.There was one exception we found to the Tropical drink dilemma. The Margaritas at the Mexican restaurant were very good. They had a blender and the margaritas were made to order. They must also have had different tequila.Hot tubs/jacuzzi. The Bavaro has four outdoor Jacuzzis. You must make reservations days in advance, and this was unusual to us but not a big problem. We made reservations for the next three days at 4:30PM. The problem we had was the temperature of the water. Generally, a Jacuzzis should be between 98 and 103F for that ooh-ahh feeling. Since the temperature of the jacuzzis was about the same as the pool (maybe 85 to 90), I just didnt see the point. I was disappointed, no ooh-ahh. I made a comment to the management, and the next day one of the tubs was at about 105. A little hotter than I like, but I didnt complain. Recommendation: Dont be afraid to ask for a hotter temperature.Mosquitoes? Afew. Not what we would consider a problem. We did see them fogging the gardens on a couple of occasions. Roches or ants? Didnt see a one in the room. One spider in the room. No big deal. Remote control? Yes, dont forget to ask when you arrive. Food? If you cant find something that appeals to your pallet at the buffets, there is something wrong.In summary, the Bavarro has almost reached what I would call a five golden apple level. They are obviously trying hard, but they just seemed to have cut some corners that we feel shouldnt have been cut for a five golden apple experience. Unfortunately, those corners were important to us. We probably wont return unless these items are fixed.However, if you just want to drink to get drunk, and dont care how it tastes, And, you dont mind eating gourmet meals served in gourmet style, in gourmet restaurants while sweat drips down your face, And, Being comfortably cool in your room doesnt matter to you, And, Its important to you that everybody wears long pants when they eat, Then you will love the Bavaro. No question.Cheers, Jay and Teresa

<Content>Bellisimo resort terrible service (by some staff) My novio and I went to the D.R for an Electrical Convention with 140 Electrical Contractors fron NY. We started at Casa de Campo (I recommend it to every1) and then ended up at Iberostar Punta Cana. To compare the resorts would be well not nice. At Casa de Campo we got spoiled treated like royalty, at Iberostar well the resort has more beautiful features but upon arriving from a 2 hr drive the front desk staff where not happy, (although I'm from the D.R and tried my perfect spanish with them) they did not explained about the safety box or the remote control rental fee and when I called from my room to enquire about both items I was given an attitude (I gave it right back which it helped). I asked for help with the safe and some1 arrived 2 hrs later. We did not encountered any problems with the rest of the staff so I have give merit to the other staff members. Dont get me wrong the resort is worth every penny (only if they train the reception staff a little contersia with the guest). Be prepared to pay if you lose your towel card ($15US) this is a money making resort and they prove it to a T. They even charge to rent the Iron. well just bring your Iron w/u. Would I go back to Iberostar Punta Cana NO. Would I go to Iberostar in Puerto Plata SI. Now Casa de Campo defenitiva mente I would go and recommend to any one and they also have all inclusive packages and you get treated like royalty. Buena suerte a todos que vallan a Iberostar. Adios from a 100% Dominican girl.

<Content>Honeymoon at the Iberostar My husband  I spent our honeymoon at the Iberostar Bavaro during the week of Oct 13-20, 2003. Overall, it was a great trip. The staff working at the resort are very friendly and work very hard to keep the place spotless. The gardens are kept in very good shape and it was romantic to walk through them at night, to and from our room. Our room was above average. We had no problems with the A/C and we were very comfortable sleeping in our king bed. We weren't very impressed with the food or drinks. Corona would have been nice, but was only available in the Mexican restaurant. The Japanese restaurant was our favorite. We didn't take any excursions through the resort, but did take full advantage of Dressel Divers, right at the resort. They were an awesome group of people and we went scuba diving 4 times through them. They are very organized and trustworthy. Two of the dives were on a day excursion to Saona Island. (Hello to Tito  Fred!) The beach was very relaxing at the resort. Some rocks at the entry of the water, but nothing too major. We spent no time at all by the pool. We can sit by a pool here in the states. Plus, the pool area was very active with children activities and Star Friends. We preferred the quiet beach scene anyways. We had no problems at all coming into  leaving the Punta Cana airport. So, as I said before, overall it was a wonderful trip. Not sure if we'd go there again, but we were happy with pretty much everything at the resort.

<Content>A great place to relax My husband and I (23 and 21) stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro the week of October 20-27. This was our third all-inclusive vacation since our honeymoon at Swept Away, Jamaica in 2001 and a vacation at the Fiesta Grand Resort, Riveria Maya in 2002(this one recently changed their name to the Palladium). Anyways we love the all-inclusive packages and this one was the best deal yet. We flew into Punta Cana on USA3000. This was our first charter and it was great! The flight attendants were so friendly and they served us a tasty meal each way. We also watched movies (Daddy Daycare and Bruce Almighty) on the way there and back. A+ When we arrived we were surprised to see such a cool airport. It seriously looked like a resort with its thatched roof(a huge difference from the Jamaica and Cancun airports with no air cond.). After getting off the plane we were greeted by two women dressed in traditional dominican costumes to take our picture. We were able to purchase this colorful 5X7 for $6US on the way home in the airport. Then we promptly were taken to the resort on a big air cond. tour bus. It was about 1pm when we arrived and our rooms were not ready till 3:30. Be prepared to change into suits so you can wait by the pool. The rooms were quite spacious and I thought the air cond. worked just fine. We actually turned it off part of the time because we got chilly. Make sure to pick up your T.V. remote at the check-in desk. The beach was INCREDIBLE! The main reason to do this type of vacation is to relax on the beach, right? If soft white sand and refreshing caribbean blue water it what you're searching for, this is the place to go. By the way don't be surprised to see lots of topless and thonged women and men alike. Don't get too excited, they are never the people you would want to see in this way. I was curious if they were getting better deals at the beach markets by shopping topless. Where is their modesty? We did get some good deals from Tony cheapy-cheapy, but he said his boss wasn't there and it was a liquidation sale. You'll have some good laughs at the beach markets. Over all the food was decent. Don't come expecting everything to taste American because you may be disappointed. We certainly didn't go hungry by any means with all the variety and desserts. The ice cream hut on the beach was great, especially chocolate chip. When you arrive make your reservations for the specialty restaurants right away. If you would like to try one at the dominicana or punta cana hotels book them first because they fill up. It seems like you can almost always get in a specialty at the bavaro the same day because there are less people here. Make sure to try the Gourmet, Steak House and the Japanese. I would definetely recommend going on the Outback Safari trip. It rained the entire day on Thursday but we still had a great time on the trip and our guide Nacho was hilarious! He spoke four languages and was very informative. The best was when they take you boogie boarding. Thank goodness for hot showers at the hotel because we were numb from the rain and swimming. It was well worth it though! There was a tropical storm going through the area and I think that is why we got so much rain Wed night, Thur, and Fri. Good news is they are not expecting a hurricane until 2007. We were ready with our umbrella to walk to and from the restaurants at night. Friday during the day we read our books on the beach in the rain under the little canopies and did our shopping at the beach markets and hotel gift shop. The weekend cleared up beautifully and we got our suntans. Take advantage of the massages on the beach, they were so relaxing and pretty cheap too. Make sure to wake up for the sunrise at least once since the sun sets on the opposite side of the island. We hit the beach about 6am and it was gorgeous! There was even a rainbow. Take lots of pictures!! If you think pink flamingos and peacocks are for the zoo, think again. These neat birds were free to roam the resort. We mostly saw a wide variety of birds here and no iquanas like in Mexico. One of the biggest differences between here and Mexico or Jamaica was a bit of a language barrier. Many of the hotel staff did speak English, but a lot of the vacationers were European. When traveling we always try to meet other couples and we found this to be a little more difficult here since a lot didn't speak English. We did finally meet a very nice couple from Cleveland on the safari trip. We enjoyed eating a few dinners and playing cards with them later in the week. All in all my husband and I had a wonderful vacation in Punta Cana. Don't listen to the negative reviews. If you go with the mindset to try new things and to take it easy you'll love it.

<Content>Highly recommend Iberostar Bavaro I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Iberostar Bavaro- stayed from October 16-21 and took my 10 year old daughter with me.Check in and Check out went smoothly no waiting at all and a welcome drink on arrival.Room- Stayed in a garden view room that was just great. Unlike other people I did not have any problem with it not being cold enough. However, the lobby and most of the restaurants are open air and quite hot but it is the tropics. Beach- Awesome!!!! Pool- Large and clean and a lot of fun Food- good but not great. Loved the a la carte restaurants but unfortunately you can only eat in these 1/2 of the time your there. The drinks at the bars were wonderful. Not overly watered down and always served with a smile.Staff- I can not say enough about the staff and their friendliness. they were always willing to cater to every need. The language barrier is NOT a major problem. Most speak at least a little English. Just be patient and understanding. Overall I thought the resort was definately worth the money, which is a steal compared to the rest of the Caribbean.

<Content>Please read before you go!!!  My Wife and I stayed at the Iberostar Bravaro from October 20-27. The resort was beautiful when u first walk in you see marble floors and pretty construction of the buildings. They have water ponds as part of the landscaping with fish and turtles in them. The rooms are very nice with plenty of room. The only problem was that when you leave the room the electric turns off after 20 minutes or so. So your room never really gets cold till you have been in there for more then a couple of hours, the same goes with the drinks in the frig. Most of the places don't have air conditioning like the buffets except for some of the specialty restaurants. Americans are the minority there at about 40% so you will see plenty of Speedo's and topless woman on the beach and a few around the pool. The pools are large and well maintained like the grounds. Food- We went to a few of the specialty restaurants and this is what we thought of them. Mediterranean- was my favorite one because I like seafood. They had lobster, shrimp, fish, and more. It was also air conditioned. The Gourmet- was my wife's favorite they served a five-course meal. The main course was steak with a peppercorn sauce. Also air conditioned. Mexican- was good we both enjoyed the soup (Cream corn chowder) and the meal was pretty good. They also served Corona the first night we were there but, the next time we went with an other couple later in the week and they had no more Corona. They also had air the first time we went but the next time they had it off. So it was hard to enjoy the food the second time around when it was so hot in there. Steak House -was pretty good with small portions. This place was with no air not because it didn't work it was because it was under roof and open all around. The buffets were not that good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Bars -were ok if you liked Presidente beer( which is horrible). The frozen drinks weren't frozen most of the time. The drinks didn't taste like they do in the States like a strawberry daiquiri tasted like it had grapefruit in it and not strawberry's. I had read from a review that they had Heineken beer but we were told that they stopped carrying it. Excursions- we went on the Kantiki Boat and had a good time. We went snorkeling for about an hour  saw a lot of coral and some fish. Of coarse this was before we had to much to drink. We were also disappointed that the staff didn't get people to drink a lot more. It seemed more like social hour than a booze cruise. Still had great time. Out Back Safari- we had Munchie as a tour guide very knowledgeable and very friendly. We stopped at a normal Dominican house to see the way that the family lives 11 kids (wow). Then we drove up into the mountains and got a feel of the country side we stopped for lunch had some sandwiches. Then we continued into the rain forest. We went to this beach and went swimming after driving most of the day I think everyone was ready for the swim. They had boogie boards and we rode waves in a lot of fun there. Could have spent a lot more time there and should have had lunch there to. Trip was worth it. Activities -I liked volleyball and water polo unfortunately they both started at around the same time. Was not interested in other activities that they had but had great competitive time playing those two sports. Wanted to try the catamarans but the wind was not with us each time we tried. In conclusion we would not recommend this resort in Punta Cana because of food and the lack of things to do inside and out of the resort. If you like a lot of different foods and know they will not taste Americanized and want to relax then this place would be fine for you.

<Content>Unbelievable!!!!!! We just got back from our wonderful stay at Iberostar Punta Cana. The grounds are beautifully kept and the people there are so nice. The drinks were flowing from morning to evening every day and it was wonderful. I just tipped every now and then and the bartenders seemed happy. I didn't really spend that much money there except for souviners and the casino. Oh, any gamblers reading this: Watch out for the dealers because they make alot of mistakes and they are wolves. They don't even smile while they are taking your money.  Anyone who is reading this that is worried about eating certain foods please don't worry. The food is fine. My girlfriend and I each had the fish and other seafood and it was very good. We didn't get sick or anything like that. The beach is the most beautiful I've ever seen. I spent lots of time their. We went on one excursion. The four-wheelers. It was the best $56 I ever spent. We met a nice couple from Massachussettes.You can buy a video of your experience. It was only $30 and it's worth it. I have no complaints at all. A truly awesome experience all the way around.

<Content>Food poisoning My husband and I went here for our honeymoon and he ate at the seafood restaurant and had the lobster and got the most severe case of food poisoning I have ever encountered. We had to go to the little thatch medical hut on the resort and he got an IV because he was so dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea. The flight home was hell- Apple vacations didn't help us at all and we had to endure three days of agony. He couldn't even open his eyes and was so sick he hallucinated and talked about dying. He won't touch any seafood to this day. DONT EAT THE SEAFOOD!!!!!

<Content>Best holiday we have ever had!! My boyfriend and i went for 2 weeks in September and had the best time ever. When we arrived at the hotel it looked so posh and amazing we couldn't believe our luck. Our room was air cond with a mini bar that was always stocked up fully - especially if you tip the maid. We went on a Dominican Discovery trip whilst we was there and its well worth it, also the trip to saona island was brilliant... Bavaro is the best hotel as you can use the facilites at the Dominican and Punta Cana hotels but they cant use yours, but to be honest you wouldnt want to leave the hotel. The Steak and Gourmet Restaurant was really good and the buffet breakfast lunch and dinner was lovely, alarge selection of choice and always well stocked even 5mins before it closes. The staff were always very friendly and the star friends entertainment on the evening was very funny. The all inclusive was excellent value for money, drinks were international brands and the el presidente beer was so nice. If you are looking for paradise, a place to relax, to have fun then this is the place to go. This was the first place i have been and didnt want to leave ever.

<Content>Fun filled and entertaining vacation If you really want to have a great time go to the Iberostar Bavaro. We stayed at the resort from 10/04/03-10/10/03. Going thru the airport and check-in at the hotel was a breeze. The front desk clerk had everything ready(keys,wrist bands,hotel map etc.) Rooms are very clean, food is good at the dinner buffet. Below average at the poolside lunch buffet. There is, however an abundance of choices of foods and fresh juices. I recommend the seafood restaurant(we ate the Paella). The steak restaurant is good but you will leave hungry. Make your reservations early so you can then go to the buffet before it closes at 10pm. Theres entertainment such as dance lessons and sporting events around the pool area from 10am-5pm. The nightly shows begin at 9:45pm and are excellent. The drinks at the bars,mixed and frozen are above average. The disco opens from 11pm-3am and plays all kinds of int. beats from progressive to latin. Excursions are very good and inexpensive. We recommend the Santo Domingo excursion and the Bavaro Splash where you would drive your own boat at full speed out to sea and then Snorkel among hundreds of exotic fish. I don't recommend the Cave Fun Fun excursion unless you would like to ride your own horse 2 miles, hike on flat and hilly terraine in the hot sun for about another 2 miles, zip into a 40 foot cave with a rope and then walk another 2 miles inside the wet cave with rocks inside your shoes(to get out the cave you will have to walk in neck high water and will have to swim in 10 ft deep water for about 30ft). We are 31+27 and exercise regularly, but this has got to be the ultimate work out! -Negatives: Depending on where your room is, be prepared to walk at least 100-300 yards to the pool or buffet/restaurants. If it rains continuosly,you will starve(if you dont like to walk, stay at the less expensive Dominicana or Punta Cana Resorts). The beach is topless optional and can be inappropriate for small children. The number of reservations for the specialty restaurants are decided based on the # of nights stayed.. Despite these negatives, overall the hotel is very beautiful, the hotel staff very friendly, and you will have something to do all hours of the day. If we go back to the Dominican Republic, we will certainly go back to the Iberostar bavaro. GO MARLINS!

<Content>Beautiful Punta Cana Punta Cana is a beautiful beach area. The beach and the resort complex, the Iberostar Punta Cana and the Dominicana are superb. There is a magnificent courtyard in between the two buildings, with wonderful gardens and fountains. The two pools are huge and never too crowded. The ocean water is always bath-water warm, and lots of waves to play in. The food was mediocre, but we weren't there to eat anyway. The buffet is huge, and even the pickiest eater should be able to find something. We did two excursions through our Apple representative, snorkeling tours off the resort, which were great too. The James Bond speed-boats are cool, and the snorkeling is absolutely terrific! The trip from the resort to the excursions was an eye-opener though. Poverty is very widespread in the this area of the Dominican, and garbage is strewn all along the road side. That part did make me sad. There isn't much to do outside of your resort, if you are interested in exploring on your own. Driving is dangerous and I would not recommend it to anyone who isn't from DR to attempt it. Call a cab. All in all, I would recommend this resort and destination.

<Content>Paradise visited at the Iberostar Iwas apprehensive about visiting a new resort for the first time, but soon put all my fears to rest. the staff was both courteous and helpful. The grounds are maintained in a superior war, and the entire hotel and grounds were extremely clean If you can not find food that you like, then you have a problem. Breakfast is always a safe meal, and there is something to please everyone at the buffets. I did not find the specialty restaurants to my liking, but there is always time to go back to the buffet. The airport is the most quaint sight, but upon arrival, I do think they are a bit too pushy with the tourist cards. There really is no place to fill out the forms. Please do not wait to visit the ladies room at the airport upon arrival as there are only 2 stalls. All in all, I would revisit in a heartbeat.

<Content>Take all of the negative reviews lightly We were more than nervous about our trip to Punta Cana after reading all of the bad reviews - remember this - there will always be more negative reviews than positive reviews. First of all, the IberoStar was the first stop from the airport which was fantastic. They let us check in immediately - which we did not expect (12 noon) and took us to our room. The room was great - like most resorts in Mexico or the Caribbean. The two pools were great. They did get a little noisy from time to time but if you stayed at the northern most one you were in good shape. You do need to get out early to get seats but it is so hot there you will be spending most of your time in the water anyway. The beach was beautiful and the water is bath water warm. The food was pretty good - not fantastic but not bad - and I consider myself very picky. There is plenty of evening entertainment. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for good weather, relaxation during the day, and fun in the evening (not crazy). We wanted to extend our trip. There were four of us mid thirties.

<Content>nice resort, but would not go back to dominican republic I stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana Resort at the end of Sept into Oct. I went with my wife and daughter who is almost 3 years old. I also went with my mother. I will try to give you the pros and cons of my trip. I would first start out as saying that I have been to Cozumel Mexico(Nice) and Turks and Cacious. (Really Nice) stayed at Beaches resort. The Price that I paid pp was excellent and it was the main reson for picking this resort. The resort was worth the money, but I would not pay too much more to stay there. I booked through Liberty Travel, who booked my flight with USA 3000. Nice plane. they booked my transfer to and from the hotel with Pireto Tours(spelled wrong). Please read Info below about the tour company they used. AIRPORT.. nice airport, but there is no information about were to go to get on plane. A bit confusing. Customs and other functions at airport were quick and easy. Pireto Tours..... They were the transfer (transportation) to and from the airport. They drive crazy, and have no regard for your life or your familys. Drive similar to the other islands i have been on. BEWARE if your travel agent books your transfer with this company tell them that you want Apple Vacations to be your transfer company. Trust Me. I wish I did. Why. We meet with the Pireto Tours rep Franklin at the hotel to make sure our flight was still same day and same time and same plane number. Franklin advised us that everthing was the same. While speaking with people we came down with on the plane they were advised that the flight was cancelled and it was know in the morning hours instead of at night. They booked transfer with Apple Vacations. We went to Franklin 4 times in 2 days and told him of out finding and he told us that out flight is still the same, but the plane number was changed, and gave us a new flight number. Well the morning flight came and went.. We arrived in the lobby at 5pm for our 820pm flight. Well noboby else was in lobby to leave. Around 6:30pm Franklin came over and told us that the flight was cancelled, and that we should of left on the morning flight. I told him that why I came down 4 times because I felt something was no right. He told me that Apple Vacations never notified their company of the changes. (his desk is right next to the Apple reps at the Hotel)(Apple vacation reps are there 8 hours to assist you)(Prieto Tours is there 1 hour in the moring and 1 hour at night) Franklin told us that we will just have to stay another night, like it was no big deal. Had to call off of work. The kicker...... Franklin and his manager wanted me to open a Vocher using my Credit card at the hotel to get a room for the night. I told them that I was not giving my credit card to anybody. the manager told me that it would only open a Vocher with the hotel, and in the moring hours they would find out if Apple Vacations, Liberty Travel etc were responsible for Prieto tours not getting the notice of the flight change. I told them they could  open the Vocher and they could get paid by who ever was at fault. They refused why. Well franklin told me that I would get a better room rate then his company. All comes down to $$$$$. I resolved the matter by going to the General manager who was very nice, and under stood my problem, and gave us the same room we were in for the week. Franklin saw me talking the the manager of the hotel, and came over and told me that if he has to pay for the room out of his pocket he will, because I have a little baby with me. I thing I got my point accross, Check with your travel agent to make sure the dont's use this company. RESORT. was very nice, grounds were nice, but i thought Beaches Resort was nicer, but still very beautiful. FOOD. good, but not great. You have to keep in mind that it is not the norm that people from the US are use to. I enjoyed several of the Dominican dishes. Don't worry you will find something you will like. Bread was great, pizza was not so good. meat ok, but tough, fish and seafood good. Nobody in my family got sick. BEVERAGES. I felt they were fair to poor. The beer was good. The alcoholic drinks were poor, nothing what i'm use to. frozen drinks not real frozen. BEACH. I thought the beach was OK. My family really liked it. I did not like the waves. I thought the beach in Turks and cacious was alot better. ENTERTAINMENT. Myself and my family felt it was excellent, and alot better then my other trips to other islands. The Star friends did a great job. STAR FRIENDS, excellent people, they have alot of energy, and work hard and long hours. Thanks Laly who works in the kids. My overall vacation was good, The hotel was very nice. You will enjoy yourself.

<Content>Punta Cana Super Vacation September 2003. Spent a week with my family at the IBEROSTAR BAVARO and can say that it was Great. The waether was great, the employees were also great. The food was above average if you consider that your in a foreign country and that you did not pay out the Ying Yang. I truely thought taht the food was good. I scuba and the resort has a dive center with super workers. Take US currency and tip a dollar every once in a while. I spoke with many employees who are greatful and think that Americans are great due to the occasional tip. Tipping is not required but it goes a long way. The pool is wonderful as well as the super beach and ocean. Take an hour and visit the Captain Cooks resturaunt, not included but awesome seafood. $40 a person but realy realy good, somewhat all you can eat. GO!!!

<Content>Fantastic All Fantastic: Food, Rooms, Service, Pool, Beach, but i think, if this hotel didn麓t have Star Friends Shows it wouldn麓t be the best all inclusive hotel in Punta Cana. COMPLETELY RECOMMENDED

<Content>It sucks The only thing I liked was the tours. I took two with my wife and kids (The Outback and Saona Island). But even that I have to regret now. The skinny guy that works for apple vacations and sells the tours sold them to me for US $75 each but charged me in dominican pesos, now that I received the bill from my credit card company, I realized that I actually peid US $90. Having to make reservations to eat in a fairly decent restorant sucks when you are on vacation and they allow you to reserve only once if you are staying for less than 7 nights. That means that the rest of the time you are eating in a buffet. Don't dream about lobster anyway. Don't spect the Caribean kind of beach here, I found it only in the southern side of the Island and Saona. Be prepared to deal with the fact that you can get shadows on the beach and the pools only if you reserve the places very early in the morning (before 7AM) with your towels.I personally will never go back to an Iberostar hotel. I don't have the time to write here every single issue I had...

<Content>not worth the money My husband and I (23  20) just visited Punta Cana in August for 1 week. We did a lot of research when choosing a hotel and destination and our travel agent recommended Punta Cana. Two years ago we went to the Allegro Resort in Aruba and it was MUCH better. It was the best. Although the other reviews were helpful with Punta Cana- we were still disappointed in our vacation. I will try and give as much insight as possible.Room: Nice, Clean but kind of small. Ask front desk for remote for TV when checking in. Read directions on Safe. Ours was difficult to use but when we called - they came and helped us right away. Refridge was restocked often. Maid was very nice and did good job. We left small gifts for her everyday that we had her clean the room. We opted to only have her clean every other day for the room stayed pretty clean.Service: For the most part people/staff were friendly and helpful. Room Service was prompt. They do not understand much English which is understandable to be patient. They find someone to help you if they can't.Beach: Nice sand. Smooth and nice to walk on. Watch out on the side of Bavero closed to Domicana because there is big rocks/holes in ocean. I fell and cut both ankles up a little but I saw 2 other people with big bandages on their knees and I just know that is what happened. Ocean is less rocky farther down closer to the shopping tents but still within Bavero's beach. My husband said there was good snorkeling out by the rope boundry closer to the Domincana. He say lots of fish. He also did the comp. Scuba trip to the ship wreck that you see from the beach. He said it was ok. Not as good as skuba in north carolina - outer banks. not very deep. but still fun. Overall, once you learn the beach - it is very nice.Food: BEWARE !!! My husband and I both were ill for about 1 week after returning home. Took medicine but didn't help. This is not a big surprise to me because I have a weak stomach but my husband can eat anything and never gets sick. The food was not that good anyway. Japanese rest: ok but not a lot of options if you do not like seafood Goumet rest: The best they have. We had lobster. Mexican rest: not good food but good desserts. Steakhouse : very tough steak!!!! Tropical rest. - ok. All of the fresh fruits, juices were good (but birds tend to land on fruit so watch for fresh trays being put out) Bread was very good. Omelets good but cheese is diff. Pizza not good - usually cold. Pop tended to be watered down or flat. Go to reservation desk if you want more reservations than you get..... I think the buffet is just as good as resturants though cuz nothing is spectacular. Room Service was prompt - not great food but nice feature to have.Drinks - wonderful..... Bar lobby was the best for frozen drinks - bar on beach tended to not be as cold/slushy for some drinks.Shopping: be careful. Don't pay the price they tell you - try getting 1/2 that. also if you want cuban cigars - beware (they sell a lot of fakes)Extra Tourist attractions - manatii park - don't go - big waste of money - i read bad reviews but went anyway and afterwards wished i would have listened to people. small and nothing like american zoos and sea world. swim w/ dolphins (i didn't do) but watched and they only were in for about 7/8 minutes.Outback Safarii - highlight of trip - fun!!! our guide was Nacho - he was a blast. plenty of drinks, nice light lunch, some shopping (vanilla $1/bottle also rum for $4) , see native home, diff beach, natural river, nature..... very nice day. bring sunscreen. our tour was a bit crowded but still nice. other buses/jeeps were not as crowded - a lot of people must have wanted to go same day as us.Overall, I say that if you have the extra money - go to Aruba instead - much better !but if you do go - get medicine for upset stomach/bacteria from doctor before going. and don't have too high of expectations. also don't listen to weather men. said it was going to rain everyday we were there and only rained a little bit 2 nights. e-mail us if you want any more info....karie and sean

<Content>beautiful beach,overall a nice getaway. my wife and i recently vacationed at the iberostar all inclusive resort of punta cana,dominican republic.the dates were from 8/31-9/7.we booked our trip through apple vacations .we had no problems with apple,the usa 3000 airlines that they use are as nice as any commercial flight i have ever had.we chose the iberostar resort because we had stayed at the iberostar resort in cozamel,mexico twice and we both loved the resort.after this vacation we have come to realize that all iberostar resorts are not the same.let me start by saying that the beach at the iberostar punta cana is the nicest i have ever been to.the first thing about the dominican republic is that the minute you get off the plane they make everyone buy a ten dollar tourist card i know thay this is not a very big deal and that this is a poor country but it still is a scam. our first impression of the resort was not a great one as you entered the grounds there was nothing special about the entrance. this iberostar resort complex has 3 resorts all next to each other and everone shares everthing.some things at the bavaro are not shared but the bavaro costs a lot more.the resort is very overcrowded .we had a very hard time ever getting around the pool, and the pools were filled with kids with diapers on,even though there were kiddy pools nearbye.the guests who were not american would not speak to you even if you said hi to them.if you were walking down the walkway they would not attempt to move over at all, and if they bumped into you they would just keep walking .also if you were waiting in line and they were tired of waiting they would just cut right in front of you in line,this happened to my wife and mr personally as we were tring to check out.also my wife was sitting in a chair by an area that had a few pool tables, we were going to play pool,i had gone to the bar to get us a drink and a german women approached my wife who had our beach towels sitting on the chair next to her and started screaming at my wife saying that my wife had her beach towel, at first my wife tried being nice to the women and the women started to walk away but then returned and started useing profanities toward my wife saying we took her towel card ,we had never seen this women or had been any where near her since we had arrived on the resort.the staff was not the most friendly and none of them speak english.when we arrived our room was not ready so we had to walk around for a couple of hours without a room.when we finally got a room it had 2twin beds instead of the king size bed we had requeted when we booked our trip.the next day they gave us a room with a king size bed.the rooms were not bad the only thing is that even with the air on it is so hot and humid there that your bedsheets were wet and sticky all week long. the food is not the greatest and none of the restaraunts we ate in were air conditoned,even the one night that we ate in the so called enclosed gourmet restaraut,the place had to be over 100 degrees and when we asked them about it they acted like they forgot to turn the air on ,the food at that rest.was hte worst i had all week and i wanted to leave half way through the meal but my wife would not let me a truly miserable experience! the food was the same every day the beef and fish were always overcooked and dry the chicken was not bad,you could have a hamburger but you had to eat on a dinner roll and not a bun.they had a little hot dog stand by the pool ever afternoon the hot dogs were mushy and the buns were hard.there were 3 kinds of beer presidente was by far the best,the other 2 were undrinkable soberana and bohemia.my wife liked some of the tropical drinks she had ordered and i had several rum and cokes and they were pretty good.do not order a bloody mary they dont make them the same way we do.they have an area on the resort where they sell gifts called carribean street there a little pushy and there prices are resort prices,your better off going down the beach to by gifts there very pushy but you can talk them way down on price.the grounds inside the resorts are pretty and very well maintained .if your the type of people who want to spend the whole time on the beach sunning then i would recommend this resort . if you want to go to a prettier resort with friendly staff,better food and drink and way less crowded than go to the iberostar resort in cozamel,mexico.

<Content>Not as bad as I thought it would be! It really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. After reading so many bad review about the Iberostar Punta Cana, I had convinced myself that I was not going to have a good time and I was wrong. The place was huge, since it's combined with the Dominicana and Bavaro. The food was great and so were the drinks (not watered down). The only inconviniences were, making reservations for the specialty restaurants (everything was always booked), having to listen to instructions and annoucement in 4 or more languages, reserving seats for the show, pool and beach. The establishement is beautiful, but it need more specialty restaurants, a bigger disco and maybe a bigger place to perform their nightly show. If you can put up with these inconviniences you will have a wonderful time. The entertainment team was great and tries to get all guest involved in activities and contests. The rooms were very clean. The staff was great. Only other advise, bring a travel iron.

<Content>Beautiful beach I just got back from a seven night stay at the Iberostar. I was very nervous after I read all the reviews that people had written, that our time would be horrible, but that wasn't the case. We arrived via a charter through TNT vacations, we were at the hotel by 3:30, check in was quick, however the delivery of your luggage to your room took about 45 minutes, I advise you to pack your bathing suit in your carry on bag. The room was very clean, however the beds were pretty small. Two adults and one child with two twin/full beds. Very uncomfortable. The maid service was unpredictable sometimes came in early am, sometimes afternoon, one day I room didn't get cleaned until 4:30 pm. The morning buffet is pretty good, try the waffles. We had lunch at the pool buffet everyday the hamburgers were pretty good. The dinner buffet was awful, and the restaurants were not much better. I advise you not to try any new foods, I got very sick one night. Bring pepto and imodium. Make sure you have pleanty of sunblock you can burn with 50 spf. The pool was very nice, beach beautiful. Howerver the drinks at the pool buffet and beach bar were okay. The pina coladas are not frozen. Try drinking at the lobby bar much better. If you going with a child, I would recommend the mini club, my daughter age seven went several times and loved it. The workers are very friendly and nice. Tipping goes a long way. Have fun, any questions you can email me and I will be happy to answer.

<Content>Fun, Relaxing  My daughter 17 and I, her mom, visited Punta Cana in August 2003. We have been to many Caribbean Islands and this would be the first all inclusive. The hotel  food were better than what we expected. The Japanese Restaurant was superb. There are so many choices at the buffets that you have to find something that you like. Everyone that worked there was very nice and tried to include everyone in on the shows, dancing  activities. The Star Friends were exceptionally nice. The value of the trip was great. My advice to someone who may be going there for the first time is - bring light clothes - it's hot  humid and everything is outside including eating. The air conditioning inside is minimal. Relax, go with the flow, learn the dances by the pool at 5, sign up for some of the other activities  have the drink of the day in the lobby every night before the show starts.

<Content>Watch out for the shrimps! First and foremost, this IS the review to consider... After weeks of checking reviews through this site and others, we decided to give an ok to the Iberostar Punta Cana. Usually, All-Inclusive is not really my dream vacation, but we were a group of six with a tight budget, so this actually was the best package. Anyway, the property filled my expectations. It was, as everybody said, very clean, well taken care of, a little taste of wild life with some chicken, roosters, peacocks and other birdies jumping around while you walk and eat... The rooms, to my surprise, were in excellent conditions, i always pay much attention to the bathroom, which was very clean, good pressure in the shower, nothing to complain. We, at first, were given a ground floor room, just give a good tip to the receptionist and he'll be happy to find an unexpected vacancy on the top floor with seaside view... the beach is definitely beautiful, although the water gets perfectly still and turquoise if you walk up north on the beach, towards the ship wreck. Bear in mind that the authorities have banned jet skis so the only motorised sports you can do are banana boats. The resort offers kayak anb catamarans which you have to take lessons for $25 if it's the first time you navigate. Now make sure you get to the beach before 9am to get a palapa, throw your towel like everybody does and go to get breakfast, otherwise get ready for a long hunt. if not, you'll have more luck around the pool. The real weakness of the resort is the food. Don't get me wrong, the food is ok and i was not expecting 5 stars quality, but it gets very repetitive and i strongly regretted that there wasn't a dominican buffet, with local recipes which we enjoyed when we took trips around the island. I have one of the strongest stomach, never have problems of such kind, and i could not believe i actually got sick from one single shrimp. The pepto-bismol i thought i'd never use, was in fact very relieving. So a little advice: if it doesn't taste good, especially when it comes to seafood or fish, spit it out, you'll save yourself a good night of sleep. Otherwise you can indulge on the fruits, i have never eaten mangoes or pineapple this good before. The restaurants situation sucks, you eat pretty much the same things as the buffet, except the fact that you're being served the main course (you have to go through the same motion for the appetizers). Only the gourmet restaurant deserves to be mentionned, but you're allowed one visit per week, so make sure you reserve it the very same day you arrive, because this will be your best meal.All in all, this was a very nice vacation, i enjoyed the fact that you don't have to worry about paying or signing for your drinks, which is the best part of the all-inclusive concept. after a couple of days, the buffet style becomes annoying, particularly at night, when you'd rather sit down and relax at a table and not having to look for your food. The staff is very friendly, sometimes flirty but they make the whole stay very pleasant. Although i have not heard or checked out myself the other resorts around, which look more or less the same, everybody seem to be very happy about the iberostar, which i would recommend for a short stay, perfect to lie on a beautiful beach, have some drinks (watch out for the local whiskey, taste like rubbing alcohol), relax, tan or play beach volley. We avoided the tours they were offering and rented 2 cars to visit a bit the island. If you feel adventurous and to relieve you from the routine of the resort, I would recommend going to bayahibe (1 1/2 hour drive) and rent a boat with a private captain if you're a group (check out the Daniel diving center, very nice people), one the highlight of our trip. If you're renting a car, please rent a 4x4, the roads are terrible and avoid coming back at night.

<Content>Disabled visitor 29 July-7 August 2003 We checked in to this beautiful hotel, but were dismayed to find that even though we had told them I was in a wheelchair, we (3 kids and 3 adults) were allocated 2 rooms on the 2nd floor! First floor rooms were found eventually, though there was one step to the doors. Within 30 minutes they had built a ramp for me and in all the public areas it was easy to move around, but had no rooms properly equipped for disability.Therefore, there were no handicapped facilities for me in the room, though they did change the fixed shower head over the bath to one with a long hose so that I could slide, with great care, on to the shelf at the far end of the bath. The large rooms were on two levels, with 2 steps to the sitting area, but they were extremely comfortable for all our party, well equipped with air conditioning and a big fan over the beds. Our room felt damp, and though we are now home, some things still smell slightly.Having said that, we had a wonderful time in a spotlessly clean hotel with immaculate grounds and beach. The buffet meals were more than generous in an enormous open dining room, though we did like the Japanese restaurant best of all. The drinks had plenty of alcohol in them and icecream and fries (and other food) were available all day in the beach bars. The staff were lovely and friendly and at the end of our stay we gave certain ones a few dollars for which they were very grateful. Entertainment for adults at night was a bit juvenile. My daughter was extremely ill just before we went home (probably a bug) but the resident doctor visited her in her room, treated her properly and enabled her to get home safely.We plan to visit another hotel in the Group next year (it will be our third) but add a plea that they do something toward disabled guests' safety in some rooms.

<Content>It was absolutely amazing! 8*13*03  After a week stay at the Iberostar Punta Cana, I wanted to cry. Not because I didn't have fun, but because I had to leave. The food was good, a large variety. I have read some complaints about the food, but you have to remember these people have very little money, and you can't please everyone. I have no complaints about the food at all. The staff was amazing, the most friendly people I have ever seen. It seemed that they worked all day long, every time I turned around I saw the same waiter/ waitress at every meal. The bartenders work the hardest(in my opinion), they always served me with a smile. Gorge was the nicest. The entertainment was great also, they had a new show every night, they even had a show for kids around 8:30pm every night. I don't have any kids, but alot of people brought their very young children, which I really didn't understand. To me it seemed more like a nice relaxing vacation, why bring children?! This was my boyfriend's first time out of the country and he absolutely loved it. Even after the entertainment there is still more for you to do if you're not too tired from the big meal and the show. They have a disco club that plays alot of spanish music, but from time to time you will hear something that you can relate to. The beaches are breath taking and it is true, if you don't get there early you will have a hard time finding chairs, but its not impossible, everyday after about 10 minutes of walking around we found a few chairs. And it is also true about the women with no bathing suit tops. There are alot of French women there and they are used to that kind of stuff, so after about the 2nd day, I was used to seeing. My boyfriend loved it, lol. The only problem was that you're not allowed to be topless at the pool, only on the beach, but alot of people did it anyway, and it made me feel uncomfortable because there were so many children in the pool.Anyway, the surroundings were beautiful, there were peacocks, flamingos,and even chickens on the property. It was so nice. To be honest the only one complaint that I did have was the maid sevice, but even that didn't bother me too much. One day our room didn't get clean until about 3:00pm and another day our room didn't get cleaned at all. I honestly didn't want to leave, by the time I got really comfortable it was time to go. I would go again in a heartbeat. I loved it there, hope you do too!

<Content>Very nice all inclusive I'm not exactly a world traveler but I've been on two cruises and stayed at an all-inclusive before and was pleasantly surprised by what we found. The Iberostar is one of three resorts. We were at the Bavara and it's made up of codominium like units that were spacious and clean with a huge bed and European amenitites like a bidet in the very large bathroom. Our room was closer to the pool area which made the walk to the buffet and restaurants rather long, however on the up side the nightly entertainment at the bar/lobby area did not keep us up late and it was a short walk to the beach. The Bavara, Dominicana and Punta Cana resorts all let you use the facilites. In other words our strip of the beach was quite lengthy and we could have lunch at the Dominicana if we happened to be at that end of the beach. The beach was clean and the sand nice but the waves are choppy so snorkeling off the beach was challenging but it made sea kyaking a blast! The food was good and the buffet offered lots of choices for even the picky person. The specialty restaurants were ok, the Japanese restaurant was not good but the Seafood was excellent. We read this web-site religiously before going so it was very informative. Leave the bug spray at home though, never needed it and only bring sunscreen with an SPF of 45 or higher as you will get burned with less and re-apply often if you swim. The only other caveat I would warn people is that if you do get sick (my boyfriend was miserable) and end up going to the medical clinic it is very pricey. $250 for an IV and some pepto bismal of which we are not sure if his health insurance here in the states will pick up. But it was worth the money since 10 minutes after the IV he was feeling 90% better and it only meant spending one day of our vacation in our room plus the clinic is open 24 hrs. so at the first sign of seious illness go to the clinic! Also keep in mind that this resort caters to EUROPEANS. That means that nudity on the beaches is rampant. Many women in thongs who had no buisness showing that much skin and lots of breasts in every shape and size. By day two even my boyfriend quit staring. Plus the food is more European, lots of cheeses and olives and food that you don't see often in the US. The hotel has free snorkeling equipment and other toys that are non-motorized but anything with a motor costs extra. There is a stable right off the beach and they offer evening beach rides for $35.00 for an hour and a half and $20.00 morning rides for an hour that are inland. We also went on the Kontiki snorkel trip which is basically a booze cruise but the rum was not watered down (the resort waters thier alcohol down) and the entertainment was amusing, another caveat, people get crazy and there was some flashing so little kids and bible thumpers should stay away. Overall the resort was very nice, the grounds beautiful and lots of exotic wildlife on the resort like peacocks and other fowl to keep you entertained at dinner and breakfast. The beach was clean and the water clear enough to snorkel (take dinner rolls out to feed the fish and you will have them all around you) The people were friendly but few spoke good English so take along a spanish phrase book. Have fun and remember your vacation is what YOU make of it. Oh last warning, it takes $10 to get in to the country and $10 to get out. Don't make the mistake of thinking your travel agent picked up this tab or included it in your price, they will make you pay it again regardless. Fill out the top two slots of the form they give you, hand over your money and you are in. Have fun!

<Content>BEST VACTION EVER- aside from the "Star Pervs" Well where do I begin? The vacation was definitely the best vacation I ever had. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Anyone who enjoys relaxing on the beach or by the pool and just enjoying the atmosphere and beautiful blue water. The water sports were fun. Stay away from the banana boat. We were tossed out into the water and couldn't get back on and then the boat got stuck in coral. It was really fun til we were tossed off. We met some people who were tossed off into the coral and got cut up pretty bad. The driver was nuts! There was plenty of activities to do during the day. It became a bit of a routine after a while - but a good routine. Got up, saved chairs by the pool, ate muffins (cause the ropes would go up so that's all we had time to grab haha), learn dances, play volleyball (we sucked but hey we were on vacation- we got better by week end haha), sit around and talk then go shower (try your hardest to get the sand off- it just wouldn't come off) and get ready for dinner. Go save tables for the show, watch the show go to the disco and then the 3am buffet then go back to our room where we were followed by the security guard telling us to shush the whole way back - same thing next day. We barely made the breakfast buffet by the pool area let alone the main buffet which was supposed to be a thousand times better. All in all the food was pretty good. The meat was a little on the tough side. The chicken was excellent. Only one of us got sick on this trip but that could have been a for a variety of reasons. I was reading reviews about how bad the food was and to watch out so I was cautious, but it was fine.The hotel was very nice. You had to walk forever to get where you were going but it wasn't that bad. We enjoyed the shows every night. They were funny and the audience participation was great. What some people won't do for their 5 minutes of fame I'll tell ya. The only annoying thing about the show is that its in 4 languages (English, Spanish, German, French) so it takes forever for them to say anything. Then it was off to the disco. Now, being from NY the music was a bit behind the times. But it was the only place that had AC and all you did was sweat all day and night (the humidity is terrible- forget your hair dryer girls don't even bother- frizz frizz frizz) so you welcomed going in there. Then we discovered the Star Rock Cafe right next to the disco. That was not usually crowded and we had some fun in there the last few nights playing pool and card games. There's nothing like ordering round after round and it's all included. That was the best thing. You definitely get your money's worth between eating and drinking whatever, whenever you want. Even after the club at the 3am buffet, you could continue your eating and drinking fest. It was great seeing everyone stumbling in drunk trying to order eggs and clucking like a chicken because they didn't know the Spanish word for egg. You made instant friends and enemies at this drunk buffet haha. The staff was great- they were VERY helpful and eager to do things for you.My sister and I went for massages-very relaxing. My only recommendation is don't go near the sand before cause then it feels more like a body scrub with the sand- its so damn hard to get off. Some guys we met were offered Happy Endings and it was rumored that some of the female staff doubled as prostitutes.Now about the Star Pervs as me and my friends refer to them. We were all happy happy in the beginning. They were great. They had plenty of activities going on and they were flirty and really nice at first. But then they took things to another level. Once they thought you would Cheeky Cheeky with them, you were in for some blunt all out sexual harassment. They were not shy about asking you for sex or telling you that they wanted you to go to a hotel with them. I mean me and my friends just laughed it off- we didn't want to get anyone in trouble. Then we started to avoid them for the last few days. But they were persistent. I read someone's review about keeping your daughters away- I agree. They were hitting on young girls, older women- there was no age discrimination when it came to Cheeky Cheeky. I was told initially by one Star Friend that Cheeky Cheeky meant to dance. NO WAY- It's a sexual reference. One Star perv grabbed a friend of mine in an inappropriate place. It was not only embarrassing but violating and very uncomfortable as there were other guests standing nearby. Just keep your distance.Like I said earlier- this place was great. Very nice and relaxing and all in all I had a great vacation. If you just keep your distance from the Star Perv's and don't let them cross a line you will be ok. We met people from all over the world and even more people from our area. We had so much fun and lots of laughs. It truly was my favorite vacation. I have lots of great memories to go with my pictures from this vacation and I'll treasure them always. I just want to say thanks to all my new buddies for making this trip a memorable one.

<Content>Have a Great Time at the Beach It was Wonderful.Background: We had 2 parents with 4 children aged 21-17 in three rooms.Cleanliness: The were no bugs anywhere. I started looking to see it I could find any. The rooms were spotless. The bathrooms at the beach were sparkling. I have been to many convention centers which look like a bad filling station. The staff is constantly present cleaning.Water: Don't drink the tap as instructed by the staff. The free water beer an soft drinks in your room will suffice. There is ice in tubs on each level. We ate drank and crunched the ice without problems.Food: We enjoyed the variety of foods. The hotel has a heroic task of satifying a wide number of palates. All of our parties found food they enjoyed. I enjoyed the creseants each morning. I also enjoyed an ice cold Soberana at the beach bar. The specialty resturants were very good. We were given extra reservations even after we had used our allotment. I enjoyed the lobster which was the best I have ever had. Our children enjoyed the steakhouse. At the steakhouse I didn't eat all my meal and the supervisor was honestly concerned and offered me another.Staff: I loved the people there. Ruben and Johnie at he front desk were terrific. I would see Johnie on the grounds and he would nod and remember my name and room number. Ruben was great. I had dufficulty contacting my VIP rep and Ruben spent about 10 minutes running the guy down on the phone. When offered a tip he offered a broad smile and declined. Jack is wonderful clown that is 6'2 and is most often smiling he too recognized my wife and I. Frankie runs the entertainment and does a good job. Coleman the assistant manager is always on the facility with a broad smile and a close eye to detail. The manager is engaging and always around. The staff works 12-14hour days for 11 days straight and then get three days off. They frequently sing to themselves with a wonderful atttitude. Please tip these very nice people.Babysitting: We had no children but our observation was that the staff was VERY attentive and kind.Facilities: The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The main buffets are open air and we found always comfortable. The gourmet buffet and Mexican resturant are airconditioned. Our rooms had great baths and toilet facilities which all worked well. VERY VERY clean.Beach: This terrific. It is the best beach I have ever seen. Each morning the staff grooms the each with a backhoe and by hand. I never saw any glass or significant debris. The coast is protected by a coral reef and the beach is fine ground coral. It is not as white as the famed beaches of Fort Walton but it is close. They are far superior to Cancun, Playa, or Cozumel. The surf was great for children. Our family snorkled off the beach and there are lots of fish even there. There are no shells. That makes walkng very confortable. I always got up early to enjoy the morning beach and to select chairs. Don't move other peoples things. People are very honest and curtious. Our children would come out at 11 and get chairs in the sun.Guests: There are large numbers of French, Brits, Swiss, Germans and Americans. There are a large number of women who go topless. We never encountered any rudeness. I enjoyed talking to the people from different places as much as anything on the trip. There were lots of Cuban expatriots as quest and on the staff.Casino: This was a highlight for our kids. The table ante is five dollars if you want dollars back. If you change to pesos (dominincan dollars) the ante is 25 DR Dollars about 80 cents US. That way you get more play for your dollar.Safety: We always felt safe. There was alot of security and well lighted. General Comments: Please tip the staff they work very hard and I'll bet for very little. We left 2 dollars per day per room to the maids. I slipped an occasional guy a couple of bucks. They never expected it but were appreciative.

<Content>Loved Iberostar Punta Cana, BUT.. We just returned from a week at the Iberostar Punta Cana. We booked through Apple Vacations, and we got a great price. It was well worth the money. We flew out of Newark on USA3000 airlines. Much to our surprise it was the smoothest  fastest check-in we've ever been through. From the time we got on line in the terminal until we were sitting at the gate, including going through security, it was only 20 minutes. Perhaps it's faster because it's not computerized - when you get to the desk with your paperwork, they find you on a list, and from a box they pull out your boarding passes which already have your names. They give you the seat assignment, put the luggage tags on, and basically you're done. Although the plane boarded and left later than planned, we still arrived on time. Once the plane was in the air, they served free mimosas (champagne  orange juice). The dinner meal was a choice of pasta with sauce or bourbon chicken. When we arrived at the airport in Punta Cana, we saw that the thatched roof airport was open-air, meaning no walls, hence no air conditioning. The first thing you notice as you're walking across the tarmac is the humidity. When you get to the terminal you must pay a $10 customs fee per person (another $10 per person when you leave, as well). After you get your luggage you will find an Apple representative waiting for you. They direct you to the appropriate bus for your resort. The Ibersota Punta Cana is 30 minutes from the airport. When we arrived at the hotel, we saw that the lobby is also open air. There was gleaming tile everywhere, and in the center is a pond with a fountain and trees. Quite lovely. The check in was fast, you get your wrist band and a packet with your room keys and towel passes, and soon they lead us to our room. Through winding pathways on the ground, which we didn't appreciate unil we saw them during the daytime. The building with the rooms is also open air, with courtyards in the center filled with trees, flowers, ponds. The rooms are beautiful. The bathroom was all marble tile with a large sink vanity area, beautiful shower/tub, toilet and bidet. The room had two beds that are only slightly wider than a standard twin bed which could be pushed together to make a queen size, and a sofa that also doubled as a bed, with a trundle bed underneath. There's a large patio through the sliding doors with two chairs and a small table, plus a drying rack that pulled out from the wall for wet bathing suits. Our room looked out the back towards the back of the beach restaurant. Hard to explain, but suffice to tell you that the first thing I saw the next morning in the daylight were peacocks walking past our patio. The grounds are the most gorgeous, well-maintained of any I've ever seen, and we've travelled a lot. There's plenty of wildlife on the grounds, roosters, ducks, lizards, ponds with fish and turtles, trees, flowers, fountains. It truly was a paradise. The Iberostar Dominicana is right next door, as a matter of fact some of the specialty restaurants are in the Dominicana. It's difficult to describe, but the two resorts are really like one big one. The Ibersotar Bavaro is on the other side of the Dominicana, but you don't share privileges with that hotel. I mean like yu can't eat in their restaurants, although yo can go onto their grounds. But why would you need to, when everything you want is at the Punta Cana/Dominicana? The pools are side by side, there was music and activities all day long. You can do as much or as little as you want. The beach is right behind the pools. Despite people warning about chair saving, we found the same chairs under a palapa each day. My advice - behind the Punta Cana pool is a wall that divides the beach and pool area. Along this wall are palapas and palm trees. These seats seemed to fill up last, but they're really centrally located between the pool and beach. We had no problem with chairs. The pool was great, and the ocean is a lovely turquoise color. Who needed snorkleing, the water was filled with fish - especially these small white fish. I mean as white as chalk. And larger silver colored fish. None that bothered you or anything, but hey, you are in the ocean. There's gonna be fish! The ony complaints I had were about the food - I found it mediocre at best, even in the specialty restaurants we went to. The mexican was not great, in my opinion, and the lobster in the gourmet restaurant was the size of a shrimp. There were a lot of dishes in heavy sauces, and the sauce for the pasta we found to be very bland. I've had better frozen pizza, and the bacon for breakfast is sitting in a serving dish filled with the grease it was cooked in. The breakfast cereal is in open bins, which is that humidity tastes stale. The buffet restaurants are filled with flies. Oh, and I must warn you - they say that the tap water is filtered but advise you not to drink it. We only drank the bottled water in our fridge, but saw other people who drank tap water and did get sick from it. So be warned. Bring Immdium anyway, because I had a problem which I think was from the heat more than the food. Also, use the strongest SPF sunscreen you can find. Even with SPF 45 I still got burned - I can imgine how bad it could have been without SPF45. Bring Off or some kind of bug spray. I didn't, and my legs are full of bites that turned into welts. They may be from the biting flies in the buffets. All of the hotel, except for your room, a few shops and a few specialty restaurants, is open air. No air conditioning. That means when we checked out of our room at 12:00 as they tell you, we had to wait in the non-airconditioned lobby until the bus came to pick us up. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed due to severe weather in NJ, so our 8:20 flight didn't leave until 12:30 - that means we spent 12 1/2 hours in the heat and humidity. I can tell you more, but I'm still recovering. I'll leave you with this - the resort is beauiful. The service is impeccable. Friendly people greeted us each day with Hola and Buenas Dias. We had the time of our lives, and now that we know what to expect, we would definitely go back. If anyone has questions, please feel free to e-mail me at bythehex@aol.com and I'll answer as best I can. I think if you go with the expectations that you'll have an enjoyable, relaxing vacation, then you'll love it. - Sharon -

<Content>Remember you are not in the US First let me say that four of us booked in two rooms for our trip to Iberostar in Punta Cana through Orbitz. I will never use Orbitz again, they almost talked me into a $700 additional charge because I booked my ticket under Steve and my given name is Stephen, when I called in to ask a question. Now to the trip, make sure you have $10 per person to enter the country, as soon as you arrive you must fill out additional documentation at the airport before you can go through Customs, so take a pen and be patient. You must also have $10 to leave the country when you leave...be prepared. There was only two customs lines so it takes awhile. We were transported in a very used van so be prepared, I thought the transportation provided by Orbitz would have been better after spending $1500 per person. Check-In was a nightmare. The front desk had never heard of NLG Vacations which is what was shown on our documents by Orbitz. The hotel had no record of our reservations, even after showing our paperwork. After 30 minutes, they found our packets, we had been left off the login sheets and was told that NLG was used by Russian people. It was not fun. Since the Dominican was overbooked, we were put in the Bavaro, these were very nice suites, they put our rooms right next to each other. However, we were told to use the facilities at the Domincana and Punta Cana. No problem. The room was sort of musty, but that only lasted one day, it was always clean, the only complain was we never consistently got face cloths or hand towels...even with daily tipping. The food was good. The buffets are huge, with lots of variety. You must remember you are not in the US, as hard as they try, it is not what we would usually expect in the way of foods...but it is very adequate. It was also very very warm, even with the ceiling fans and you appreciated the few breezes that you got. We ate at the Steakhouse speciality restaurant one night and it was very good and I reccommend this. The drinks are fine, I never saw any of the bartenders cheat anyone on the amt of liquor. The pool was nice, however this was where all the activity centered around and was very noisy, especially with the loud sound system and latin music, it was not relaxing in this area, so we avoided the pools except to change our towels and have lunch. The beach was AWESOME...and beautiful and safe. The little huts were great to sit under in your lounge chairs. The sign say no reserving, but it happens anyway. The breeze was great every day at the beach. There is a very fun market very close to the resort to do some shopping. The trip was very relaxing, one night was a jewelry flea market this was annoying because my daughter was converged on by every vendor putting jewelry on her and telling her to keep it or bring the money later, it was sort of unnerving. The shows were boring, nothing like Club Med entertainment, so we only stayed for a little while each night. However, except for the check-in, and an instance here and there...Great Trip.

<Content>Great Place...for sexual predators Although I do have to concede the Iberostar provided great service, many activities, and a good nightlife...the star friends are not what they seem. Most of them are sexual predators, so women, beware. I've seen them grope girls as young as 16. I also heard of one of the star friends who grabbed women sexually and asked them to sleep with them in a hotel. Don't let your women travel alone!!

<Content>A week long vacation in June 2003 with diving We returned from vacation in Iberostar Punta Cana over a month ago, in the beginning of June. Overall, it was a nice stay, although a few things were a little different from what we expected. Here is summary for our experience:The weather - during the whole week, it rained twice, once in the late afternoon for 15 minutes, another time - at night, also for about 20 minutes. Typical carribean rain - fierce and severe, but very quick and passing. Other than that - sun, some clouds, but very nice. (CAUTION: bring PLENTY of sunscreen, my husband's sunscreen on the face washed away in the water, and his unprotected skin was exposed to the sun for a total of maybe 20 minutes. Results - terrible sun burn with huge blisters that erupted then turned read then turned brown then finally went away for good just a couple weeks ago, after daily treatment with aloe vera and other stuff. The sun there is brutal. You even can get a small burn if unprotected by being out for a couple of days on a totally clouded day. Plus, suncreen there does cost between 20 and 30 USD for a bottle of average size, that's not an exaggeration.The grounds - gorgeous, the best lush tropical surroundings I've ever seen. Peacocks, flamingos, palm trees, coconut trees, the works... Everything is extremely well maintained.The beach - also well maintainted, white sand, very clean, many people but didn't feel extremely crowded. I have no idea why people were complaining about beach chairs being reserved and no available chairs left in the morning, we experienced no such thing (in fact, the same umbrella was available for our use several days, and location was very nice one.The ocean - beautiful turcoise waters, but... I was disappointed when we realized that the resort is situated on the Altantic ocean, not the Carribean sea (lack of research on my part) - which meant more waves (some like it, but we like the more tranquill waters). The same thing leads me to another point -The diving - nothing spectacular whatsoever, probably even less than ok. Visibility is not that great, the water was very rough (thank goodness for the dramomine in the drug store)-several people got severe seasickness on the dives, boats are TINY - 6 people max, which makes for more difficult entries (rollback) and exits. I was used to diving off bigger boats, maybe that's why the disappointment. Coral - very mediocre, not too much fish life, cloudy water. We got out open water certification there so it compensated for the lack of interesting dive spots because we had to do a lot of skills, but to dive for the enjoyment of it - waste of time. The only good thing about the diving was the dive shop, very helpful, professional, good equipment etc. THey are called Dressel Divers and they are the operators for all Iberostar resorts. SO, to sum up - if you want to go to Dominican Republic/Iberostar for diving purposes - don't choose Punta Cana, go to Bayaribe instead. They are located on the Carribean side, closer to Catalina island (nice dive spot supposedly, we never made it) - diving there is much better (we went the last day, only had to pay 80 bucks extra a person for the tour there, and if we stayed at Bayaribe it would have been a normal dive.The food - just ok. Steakhouse - I couldn't eat the main dish it was so unappealing and bland. The only place worth going is the Gourmet Restaurant, we went there for lobster night and were satisfied. Tropical is all right. I got a food poisoning from eating in Dominicana buffet one night (luckily a quick thing, kept me up all night but I was back to normal by the late morning of next day)The drinks - lobby bar is much better than any other bar on the premises. They make Bahama Mamas and no other bar does ( I guess they have the blender there). Try mama juana - nice drink! sweet and strong (as one of the bartenders later explained with a smile - dominican viagra :)The staff and service - above average but nothing to rave about, everyone was very polite, maid service was good most of the time (one day the room was not cleaned until around 6 in the evening, other times she was very late too).Entertainment - I thought it was great, lots of activities, sports, step aerobics, the guys (and gals) from the STAR enterntainment team did a really good job. Never made it to the disco, wouldnt know how that was.Misc. - one REALLY annoying thing that I wish I'd known about was the fact that there is another resort being built next to Iberostar Punta Cana, and you can here the monotonous (and very loud) clank...clank...clank... I guess from a huge craine laying the foundation (you could see it towering ito the right of the resort) ALL DAY LONG... from the room... from the buffet restaurant... from the pool.... from the lobby.... it didnt bother my husband as much as it bothered me.Overall - nice vacation. Wouldn't be back to this property (we make a point to visit every place once, because there are too many new places to explore in the world :) but would definitely go back to the Iberostar chain of resorts.

<Content>It's like this... I wasn't sure what to expect from visiting Punta Cana or staying at the Iberostar Suites after reading all the different reviews. My family and I have traveled a lot, we were in Punta Cana 7/19-7/26/03. We all thought the beach was wonderful. The sand is white with pink specks and the water is crytal clear. There is a lot of topless sunbathing on the beach (it is not allowed in the pool area). I thought I would be bothered by vendors on the beach but they are in stationary shops and you go to them. They are pushy(cheapy-cheapy and almost free today my friend are comments you hear) but it makes it kinda fun. The food...there is a variety and no one in my family even got a stomach ache. There was pizza, roasted chicken, chicken nuggets, french fries and hamburgers for the kids and those less adventuresome. We really liked the Japanese, Steak and Mexican restaurant. My husband, the steak lover said the flattened Northern steak from the Mexican restaurant (of all places!) was one the top 10 steaks he has ever had. On the nights we didn't have reservations we ate at the Star Rock restaurant next door, the food was great but you have to get there by 7:20 or the wait will be long. The hotel gift shop had the best prices for t-shirts. Do not forget your suncreen, I am olive skinned and delayed getting my sunscreen on one day and I got burned. Bring your own, a bottle of sunscreen is $12-20.00. The Monster Safari was a blast! You visit a family in their home and have coffee with them, you go and watch a cock fight demo, visit another family and taste the fruits of Punta Cana, drive through sugar cane fields and taste fresh sugar cane, visit a voodoo doctor, shop at a local store, visit a school, and have a meal and swim in a river. During your trip kids will hear you coming and run to the truck, you are asked not to throw candy or money because this encourages them and it is dangerous for them to follow the truck. When you stop and visit the place listed above you can be bombarded with kids asking for a dollar. You would be wise to be prepared and take them pencils, or other small useful gifts from the U.S. The room was comfortable but the 2 double beds are more like large twin beds. The refrigerator was always stocked and bottled water to drink and brush your teeth was always plentiful (we took someone's advice and left a $20.00 at the beginning of the week, I noticed you don't always get the same maid so I would leave $3.00 bucks a day). Get involved in the hotel games and activities you will meet people from all over the world as well as from your own hometown. Punta Cana is not America, that is why you are visiting another country right? To get the taste and feel for a different place. Enjoy it!

<Content>Will not be going back We stayed from July 20 to July 27. T he rooms were kept very clean. The beds were small, the refrigerator was not cold enough, and the tv had no remote. In every room is a step down into the living room area, which was not a good idea with a 14 month old who does not know how to go down the steps yet.The staff was wonderful, even though you had to repeat yourself a few times. The pool and beach area are great. The food is awful. If you don't have a strong stomach then your going to hate the food. I did not eat any of the meat only chicken. We lived on bread, french fries, ice cream, and chicken. The fruit was good to eat also. The Coke is flat and tastes funny. The juices that they have are really good. They also give you as much bottled water as you want. We did go to Manati Park, which is awful. DO NOT GO THERE. It's supposed to be a animal park and looked great from the brochure. They have birds in cages to look at, a dolphin pool that was roped off so you couldn't even see them. After a half hour we wanted to leave, but the bus did not come back for a hour and a half. Do not waste your time going. Overall, I would not go back to this resort. It was a cheap vacation and you get what you pay for.

<Content>Poor choice; won't be back I would recommend everyone read the June 14, 2002 review written by someone in Chicago.First, if you have any kind of a disability which affects your ability to walk; this is not the place for you. If you are close to the beach, your far from the restaurants and lobby and vice versa. It is a great place for power walkers. If it rains, there is no way, I repeat no way to get to any restaurant without getting wet.The rooms are the best on all of Bavaro Beach.Service, well if you don't mind asking for everything twice, then you won't have a problem.Room service was the absolute worst. Power went out in my room the first three nights. An hour, then an hour and a half resectively to get fixed; the third night I jimmied the door to the utility closet and fixed it from that night forward. Unfortunately, you have to depend on them for ice.The pool smelled of urine.People in the DR are generically nice;but they will like any other place try to take you if they can and that includes the front desk. My sixteen year old daughter was the victim of a scary pass. Not just your run of the mill what a pretty girl but a stop the golf cart, get out and follow her pass. She was not comfortable walking around alone and did not at night. The employees at this resort are out of control and while management called to apologize after I brought the incident to there attention; it reflects how they are performing (or not).Pina Coladas are dispensed out of a machine; they are not mixed at the bar. Restaurants are OK; pretty much the way other resorts on Bavaro Beach with the exception that you are only allowed 3 reservations for the specialty restaurants.The entertainment was the best when done by the guests. Too many strip tease scenes for a family enviroment. Overall entertainment quality was poor.The beach is the nicest in the Dominican Republic and at this place is generally not crowded. It still amazes me how many people prefer the pool to a turquoise color, shady, white sand beach.I spoke to a Belgian individual that said the Playa del Carmen IberoStar was one hundred times better.I can see why all the free flowing booze and sunshine generates all the wonderful reviews. People familiar with these kind of resorts will generally visit this place once. I travel to this beach every year for some rest; my only visit is behind me.

<Content>No Strings Attached... I question the high ratings for this resort. Im well traveled with prior stays in Dominican Republic and have no strings attached or hidden agendas. The following outlines my experience at Iberostar Bavaro, which is considered the best of the Iberostar chain within Punta Cana.ACCOMMODATIONS -The room had a roach and ant problem -My parents had to get the key for the safe deposit box at the front desk -The wrong safe deposit key was given and we had to call the front desk twice for help -The A/C broke in my room -The A/C broke in my sisters room -The A/C shuts off when you open the sliding doors to the balcony -The shower heads had to be hand held throughout the entire shower -No TV remote included upon arrival -The mini-bar refrigerator did not cool -The mini-bar is re-stocked every 2 days -The cribs provided by the hotel are old, damaged and disgusting -If you need a baby crib, bring your own portable crib -On a positive note, the room layout was ideal and spacious (i.e. Junior suites)FOOD -With the exception of the Japanese restaurant, which we considered excellent, the food is from poor to average -The hotel did not offer lobster throughout our entire stay, after the travel agent and the website claimed they served lobster -Reservations are required with very limited seating for the specialty restaurants -Pants and shirts are required for dining in any of the 4 specialty restaurants -You cannot arrive at a specialty restaurant 15 minutes after your reservation time -When I questioned their strict restaurant policies, I was told that the hotel takes pride in enforcing these rules and is not flexible -The Rodizio Brazilian restaurant and the Steak House restaurant is the same restaurant. Some publications show these as 2 restaurants -Seafood paella done once a week beach side was good but insufficient. People were left waiting in line or wanting more -On a positive note, there was food available at all timesSERVICE -I contacted the front desk 5 times for two extra towels without success -I had to walk to the front desk to request the towels personally -My father had to walk to the front desk to get the TV remote controls, since they would not deliver them to the rooms -My father had to walk to the front desk to get a key to enable the use of the safe deposit box (they provided the wrong key and had to call twice to get the correct key) -There is a daily charge for using the safe deposit box -There is a charge for using the pre-paid calling card -The pool closes at 7PM daily. No one is allowed in until the following day -No pool towels after 6PM (bad for late arrivals) -The shows are late and horrible -The casino is very basic -No A/C or fans in the lobby -On a positive note, the facility is beautiful, including the beach front -The disco is very nice -The employees are very friendlyCONCLUSION My previous stay in the Barcelo Bavaro Palace was superior with all you can eat lobster daily, clean rooms, no reservations needed for specialty restaurants and no strict dress codes. I chose Iberostar based on the ratings of this website and thought it was superior. You make your decision. This is why I question the ratings on this website. Remember, I have no strings attached.

<Content>Dissappointing for a family vacation We just arrived back from our 8 days in Punta Cana. Although the weather was beautiful throughout our entire stay, we were disappointed in the room, the food selection, and the quality of the food. We have 2 young children so getting 2 rooms was not an option for my wife and I. The room was cramped and never seemed to cool down. On 3 separate days we had a visitor in our room by the name of Big Coch Roach. Now, I realize that in any climate these visitors can make an appearance, I was a bit shocked to see them in a highly rated hotel. On day 2 the hotel was out of orange juice, Baileys Irish cream and tonic water. Orange juice in the morning is a must have in our family and finally the last day it was back. The steak restaurant served what can only be described as a 3/8 piece of leather. I would suggest eating the salmon which appeared to be a little better looking. The Japanese place was extremely warm and the food was not prepared in front of you like it is in most Japanese steak houses. We waited for 1.5 hours to get a seat at the Star Rock, then another 15 minutes to place our order and after waiting 20 minutes for the food to arrive we left before eating. Upon arriving back at our room (having not eaten dinner) we ordered room service for our 2 children. Room serivced never arrived and the kids went to bed hungry. The communication in the DR is very good when a tip is involved and not so good otherwise. We did meet some great folks from England, Philly, and NJ who shared similar thoughts about the hotel. We will find another place to vacation in the future.

<Content>The Terrific Iberostar Vacation I just returned from Iberostar Bavaro Suites on July 19th. A group of 30 (seven families) vacationed from the 12th to the 19th. We had a terrific time. Six of the nights we were able to have dinner at the gourmet restaurants. La Dorada (Mediterranean Gourmet) was the runaway favorite. The appetizers were excellent (all you can eat garlic shrimp, salmon lasanga etc.). Entrees were also excellent. The Ballena was our second favorite. Lobster was being served this week. The Japanese was also relatively good. The least favorite was the Steakhouse. The meat was not tender. With respect to the beach, you can usually obtain a lounge chairs without a problem although there was one day that most of the chairs were taken. The beach is beautiful and pristine. I consider this beach as one of the best of the Carribean. The resort suites are spacious and well maintained. The grounds are kept immaculate.Most nights we went the DC6 Disco which imitates the inside of an airplane. The disco was fun. Overall we had a great time and would definitely return to Iberostar Punta Cana. By the way none of us got sick with food so enjoy and have a great time.

<Content>This Is Only A Relaxing Holiday! The staff here are an excellent crowd, with ready smiles and Holas! bursting from within. If you can speak Spanish then it helps but however you'll find that the Dominicans speak very good English and are eager to learn it. The grounds to the hotel are beautiful and tropical, the gardeners work their fingers to the bone almost all day everyday making sure everythings pristine!(AS DO ALL THE STAFF) The food is excellent and presentation is beautiful, for breakfast the cinnemon waffles are excellent! (YUMMY!) and the stone baked freshly made pizzas are to die for! The entertainment is often repeated but can be entertaining if you aren't watching everynight. Their is a disco which often looked full so it must be good and they play Justin Timberlake theere 2 (Wu-hu!he's reali nice) However this kind of holiday is one to get involved in especially teenagers and 'only' children as it does get really boring. Rooms at the hotel were a little dissappointing, but were pleasant and contained the basics.Maid service was always good! If you are travelling on a long haul flight i would recommend booking premium service if its on offer to you-its a good choice-not a tuna can! Make sure that you bring half dollars and half peso's (Dominican Peso's) as you are charged extra 4 payments in dollars. As for trips i strongly recommend the Outback safari-it was excellent and if you get Miguel as a leader he's great say Hi! for me! Pappy was our driver he was great! This holiday is really relaxing so just bring neccessities- you may get bored! But its great fun!

<Content>Relaxing and Comfortable I have been reading reviews about Punta Cana for at least 2 months leading up to my own visit to Punta Cana July 14-19 with my wife and two boys. (7 and 2) It seems to me that the people who have been most disappointed in the resort did not do their homework and were expecting something other than what is available. The Dominican Republic is a coastal paradise, but the economy is quite depressed and not nearly as civilized as we Americans are used to. In many regards, a lot of Caribbean Countries are similiar, although when you add in the language barrier in Punta Cana, sometimes you do get the feeling you are not where you're supposed to be. With this in mind, my family was looking for the classic pool, beach, fun in the sun vacation with naps and relaxation. The Bavaro did not disappoint. The weather was perfect. The sun was hot, but proper protection, or a good base allowed for all day enjoyment without over doing it. I felt the property was clean and well maintained. No bugs in our room!! The activities where great fun for the family. My 7 year old who met a friend while he was there went from one thing to another. I felt very comfortable with the safety of the resort. He took part in the kids shows in the evening, and went with the kid coordinators to the Disco at the Dominicana for an hour each night for kid dancing. He had a blast. He slept every morning until 9:30am he was so worn out from the day before. The food in my opinion is similiar to much of the food anywhere in the Caribbean. It's not American food, but there is a variety and you don't go hungry. The Gourmet restaurant was our favorite. They serve a set 5 course meal with lobster tail. Make a reservtion for that. We were disappointed in the Japanese, but only because we as a family go to many Japanese restaurants state side. They do not come table side to cook for you, and the choice of selections is limited. I've had better drinks, but the house beer, Presidante, was decent. Always ask for extra ice, it melts fast. One suggestion that I read that I wish I had listened to, bring an insolated mug for your drinks. This will allow for a bigger and colder drink if you wish. Traveling to and from the resort and from the states was very easy. We went through Apple vactions and flew USA 3000. They were on time and very good. Overall, my family got exactly the type of week we were looking for. I am sure that at some point in time we will return.

<Content>The place to go Just came back with our 25 family group. Had a great time ad never had a problem. The selection of our rooms was not easy, but the hotel manager had to take care of us. Beautifull gardens, good food, friendly service, excellent rooms, awsome beach, great volleyball, regular drinks. I recommended to anybody with or without kids. Just make sure to bring your own medicine. I wish I can write more but I'l never finish. Adios

<Content>Best 4day Getaway Ever I feel compelled to write a review after seeing mixed and negative reviews about Punta Cana. I stayed mid March 2002 in Iberostar Punta Cana. It turned out to be the best vacation of my life-if you are a beach person and just want to relax and unwind-this is the place for you. The weather was perfect. The room was ok; but who cares, the vacation is outdoors. The buffet I found excellent, with an inmense variety, I never waited in line to eat at any time. Never even slight sick from the food. Nightly shows were quite entertaining; other than that not much night life. I did not use the pool at all, and it was mostly empty. The beach would get a little crowded and sometimes there would not be a spot under an umbrella for you; but I'd just wait for someone to leave...no big deal. The drinks were a bit watered down but once you got to know the bartender you can be specific and they would adjust to your request. Snacks at the steak/grill area were always a plus. Americans were the minority, mostly Germans and Spaniards-lots of topless girls-Yes! If you like snorkling and boating, take the Splash tour--well worth the money. Every single day was absolutely great. Most definetly reccomend it. In fact I'm planning a return this summer (2003).

<Content>Oh My God! Oh My God!!!! First thing the place is beautiful and very clean. So that this is the best part. I travel every year with my closes friends and there familys ages ranging from 10yr-53yr there are 30 of us. We are call  I'm With Them and each year we wear tee shirts with our slogan on them, It's quite catchy. This group has always taken a cruise and thought we would try something different. I booked our trip 6mos. before we traveled so that we would have no problems ha! Thats a joke. Iberostar had all 30 of us scattered around the 3 resorts. My husband and I were in Barvaro Suites very nice but my kids were in Punta Cana. They would not change our rooms. My very close friends whose children are diabetics were in another hotel then them. This was unacceptable they would not change their rooms until we were going to throw the place up for grabs. The people at the front desk suck! Very rude and not helpful at all, you better speak Spanish if you need help with anything. In the brochure it states 24 hour All-Inclusive, another joke (very funny people). Yeh all-inclusive if you go to bed at 12:00. So make sure you eat before then and forget about snacking. I think this is the first vacation I have been on that I lost weight. Walk put your gym shoes on and forget about the heels because you are going to walk and walk. Dinner plan on sweating everything is out side. Thank God for the US and air conditioning. One more thing don't forget to save some money for when you leave because you have to pay $10.00 US per person to leave the country. They change that law 2days after we were there. You should have seen the air port that day hahah. Would I go back to Punta Cana?...Maybe with only my husband. Would I stay at Iberostar resorts? NO! Good luck if you are going and don't drink the water.....

<Content>Let's All Go to Punta Cana Lets All Go To Punta Cana...by: Jim Becker ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Americans who are looking for new vacation spots will be pleasantly surprised to discover Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. 聽I had the good fortune of discovering this playground that is just now being fully explored by tourists from many countries. We traveled from Chicago OHare with our daughter, her husband and two children ages 11 and 8 on a relatively new airline called USA3000. It is only two years old and their fleet consists of new Airbus A320 jets that are clean and well-maintained. The four hours and ten minute flight takes one directly from Chicago into Punta Cana on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. This country occupies the eastern 2/3 of Hispaniola with Haiti on the west. It is approximately 800 miles SE of Florida between Cuba and Puerto Rico. Spanish is the official language however the front desk staff and Apple Vacation tour group leaders speak good English. Upon arrival we were each given a wristband that was our ticket and key to every activity in the three Iberostar hotel/resorts. The charter flight using an e-ticket was particularly nice as we did not have to land in Miami to go on to the Caribbean. The flight was fully booked, left on time, and arrived at the huge thatched-roof airport, like something out of Gilligan's Island, as scheduled. Upon arrival at the airport you must pay a $10US fee for a tourist card. It must be returned upon departure. A valid passport or birth certificate is required for entry into the Dominican Republic. Be sure to bring along a valid ID with photo. Our hotel, called the Iberostar - B谩varo, is located only 35 minutes from the airport and is rated five-star. 590 spacious and elegant rooms called junior suites were redecorated in June of 2000. Each room has a balcony/terrace, telephone, TV, air conditioning, ceiling fan, hair dryer, mini-bar and safe. The Iberostar hotel chain works very closely with USA3000 and Apple Vacations. The Punta Cana area has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Over two dozen luxury hotels spread over 23 miles of fine white sand beaches each dotted with groves of palm trees. Punta Cana beaches are very similar to those in Canc煤n. Several golf courses add to the attractive environment for those who love the game that can be played under lots of daily sunshine and ocean breezes. We chose an all-inclusive package with Apple Vacations and greatly appreciated this feature. When we arrived at our room after a quick check-in we found a large plate of fresh fruit and cheeses as well as a well-stocked mini-bar. On our coffee table was a complimentary bottle of rum. A full gallon of mineral water was a welcome treat as well. Each day the room was restocked with soft drinks, beer and water. Our accommodations were very comfortable complete with an efficient air conditioner and ceiling fan. A key was provided for a small safe in the closet that works with a six-digit code that you choose yourself. The doors work with a key-card entry system. A separate card was provided for a clean towel whenever one was needed. Everything was close by. A huge double-lobed swimming pool featured a swim-up bar, plenty of lounge chairs, shady areas with palm-leaf umbrellas and waiters who provided drinks on demand. The swim area had a continual open food buffet with Dominican music. All contributed to making the Iberostar - B谩varo most inviting. There were many families with small children at the resort. Germans, Canadians, French, Belgians, Italians, Spaniards and a host of other nationalities were soaking up the sun and enjoying the many amenities. Snorkeling, banana boat rides, beach volleyball, exercise classes, scuba trips, helicopter rides, horseback riding, boat rides and a host of other side trips were a part of the daily activities. Late each evening we noted a special machine being used to groom and clean the sand on the beach. Everything was well lighted 24 hours a day. Food was one of the highlights of our trip. Breakfast was served from 6:30-10:30 daily. The large selection of dishes included homemade breads and rolls, omelets on demand, many fresh fruit juices, meats, seafoods, vegetables and drinks. We especially liked the fresh French croissants that looked and tasted just like those in France. The noon meals were copious and each day we could try new dishes. One evening the specialty was rock lobster...and all you could eat. Needless to say the lines were long but moved rapidly. Paella was made fresh daily. The many fresh fruit juices were a favorite of my wife Jeannine. Everywhere the Dominican help was very polite and went out of their way to serve us and cater to our every need. I witnessed two table accidents of spilled food. There was an immediate rescue and cleanup made by the servers. I had traveled to the Dominican Republic on a medical group mission a few years back. This five-star experience was totally different from our style of roughing it in the countryside but the Dominican hospitality was the same. In addition to the full array of services at our hotel the Iberostar Dominicana and Iberostar Punta Cana are adjacent to the Iberostar B谩varo. Your wristband lets you eat and take advantage of all the various activities and meals at each of the three resorts. There are several outlying areas and activities that are featured. The recommended ones included Altos de Chavon in Romana (an artesian village in a mock-italian style), deep-sea fishing, Manati Park where you can swim with the dolphins, Soano Island and whale-watching in Saman谩. One can also visit Santo Domingo the island capital with 3 million inhabitants. Optional excursions included an aquatic tour, an 8-hour motorcycle ride around the island, a Calypso party raft snorkeling trip, the Marinarium marine park, a Monster Truck that is a 8X8 all-terrain vehicle that can traverse just about anything on the island, the Tropicalissimo music and dance show and of course, four well manicured golf courses. The beach had several areas for a body massage that were continually busy. Complimentary drinks that vary each day are available before dinner in the lobby bar. Coco loco, banana mama and pi帽a coladas flow freely all day long as well as the national beer called El Presidente. We found the rum-based drinks to be exceptionally sweet. The local currency is a peso. $US are accepted almost everywhere. Good souvenirs include local handmade crafts, Haitian paintings, masks and faceless dolls, precious stones like malachite, black coral or amber, and of course cigars and rum. The Cuban cigars you will have to enjoy at Punta Cana as they may not be brought back into the US. Dominican cigars are close to their cuban counterparts. There are twelve restaurants in the Iberostar complex. We made reservations one evening for the Japanese restaurant and enjoyed it immensely. The service was excellent as was the food and best part was that it was all-inclusive. It would have been a $50 plus meal in any good Japanese restaurant in the states. We feel strongly that all-inclusive is the only way to travel from our experiences at Punta Cana. Wine is always included with your noon and evening meal and again, all you want. You may ask for either a red or white Spanish wine. Both are okay but only mediocre. I appreciate and know good wine as I serve as a tour group leader for Elderhostel food and wine programs in France. Everywhere near the 3 hotels one can hear the great national rhythms of the Caribbean called Merengue and Bachata.. It is the music of the native Dominicans who love to swing and sway when they hear it. If there were any drawbacks to the vacation in Punta Cana it had to be the humidity. It ranged from 80 to 90 per cent daily and the temperatures were in the high 80s. The ocean breezes helped and without the breeze it would be a very sweaty environment. Go dressed for warm weather and expect an afternoon brief shower daily. A 45 rated sun tan lotion is a necessity and it should be applied three times a day. I know. I was burned the first day on the beach. Appropriate medications for island vacationers is also a necessity. I wish you 隆Buen viaje! in Punta Cana.

<Content>Diving was decent We visited the Iberostar Bavaro and agree with the majority of observations - beautiful resort and beach, decent food, and superb service. We also purchased a Shrimp package with Dressel divers to include 6 dives with our trip. Having not seen any mention of diving in these reviews, I thought it might be helpful to share our experience with interested divers. First, the dives are basically in the Atlantic, and hence at the mercy of stronger and less predictable seas. Heavy seas prevented us from diving the most obvious shipwreck, the Armiston, which can be seen plainly from the beach. Other divers commented it was an interesting wreck because it had been dynamited and was very torn apart. Overall, the diving was decent - not deep, but plenty of reef to sustain a good variety of fish. There's also another shipwreck called Monica's. This was a great wreck to dive because it's an old ship, with great coral growing everywhere, but still distinguishable as an old ship that sunk carrying a large load of iron bars. Very interesting. Also, there were some fun caves and tunnels on other dive sites. The staff was friendly. The boats were small, and were crowded when many divers were going out together. Unless you simply enjoy getting underwater as much as possible, I wouldn't recommend buying a package with more than 6 dives - the sites aren't too distinguishable from one another, and the seas can be too heavy and the center will change the destination as a result. Also, there are some added excursions to sites on the Caribbean side - if you're a serious diver, these are probably a much better investment. We didn't go, but have read positive reviews elsewhere. Enjoy!

<Content>The Most incredible place My Husband and I went on a three night four day stay in Punta Cana and booked thru Adventure Tours. Our tour guide Lisa was from England and had been in Punta Cana for three years. She was very helpful and friendly. First the Iberostar Bavaro is truly five star, all is inclusive even premium alcohol. Yes there is plenty do for all ages, games, such as bingo, ping pong, pool tables, painting ceramics, excellent massages on the beach, learning the dances, endless activities. The buffets were great, the large buffet of the lobby, the snack buffet at the pool and swim up bar, ice cream, sweets, nachos, popcorn, endless, the buffets always had steak, chicken, or lobster, all veggies, fruits, and breads any kind imaginable. The entire resort was what I would imagine heaven to be! The junior suite we were in was beautiful, clean, and cold. All of the Dominican people are there to serve and loving, friendly people. I highly suggest taking the outback tour, our guide Rigo was a hoot, He will tell and show you everything about His country on this 6 hour trip, and he does a great job mixing rum drinks on the back of the truck. This is the trip of a lifetime, you will meet people from all over the world and all with one thing in common relax, lay on the beach and have a great time. I cannot wait to go back whale watching this winter. FYI coconut is a natural laxative! so do not drink to many coco loco's

<Content>The plain truth about the Iberostar! I just returned from a trip to the Iberostar Bavaro with my husband and 21 month old daughter. We spent 8 wonderful days at the Iberostar Bavaro, located in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The resort is very nice and extremely clean...on the point of immaculate. The floors were so clean they looked like they were wet. Constant cleaning...constant. The resort is beautiful and the landscaping is picture perfect. Peacocks walk around freely with other various birds. The food is very good and the variety is tremendous, something different everyday day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I ate everything, tried everything and drank the water which is filtered at the resorts. Noone in my family was sick. They have various nightly activities for the adults as well as for children, mostly ages 3 and up. I gave this resort 4 stars instead of five for the following reasonThey advertise 10 restaurants in addition to the everyday buffet which is all inclusive. However, upon arriving we found that you have to make a reservation for these restaurants and how many nights your stay is determines how many times you can go to the restaurants. In our case, we were there 8 nights, so out of 10 restaurants, we got to choose 3. We could of went to the same one 3 times or to 3 different ones. If you stayed 3 nights, you (I believe) got to choose one restaurant for one time only. The restaurants are also very hot inside making it a somewhat uncomfortable dinner. The food was great however both in the buffet and in the restaurants. The best one from my opinion was the one closest to the Iberostar Bavaro buffet, began with a B. The Iberostar also has sister resorts next door in walking distance that you can also use for the buffet, restaurants or pools, casino etc. However, the Iberostar is by far the best looking one and the one with the suites of course. Our suite was nice; it did not look as big as the picture they advertise though. That picture was taken in a very sunny room with somewhat of a different floor plan. The maid service was good. If you find you do not have a remote control, they do have them, pelase ask for one from the maids. The pools were not that clean, (sand on the bottom) but what do you expect with all these people leaving the beach and entering the pools, I did it myself. The beach was post card perfect. The best tour I took was the Outback Safari. 8 hour tour...please bring at least 30+ suncreen. This your also takes you toanother beach located in what you would describe was simply Paradise. The tour guide you'd want is named Regal-he's the best guide I have ever had. Great Job!! The resort staff was extremely respectful to us and was great to my daughter, which meant the world to me. The people that work at this resort are extremely hard working people. They cater to your needs, period. Some people, somespeak broken English ( but they try) while others speak three languages. Just find someone who does speak your language if you feelyour not getting anywhere instead of talking about them like their illiterate like some American vacationers did. Yes, its a resort mainly catering to Americans, but dont forger your in their country, so brush up on your Spanish instead! The staff works hard in a hot climate all day everyday for very little pay- so show them some respect. I usually vacation in different places every year, but would definitely go back to the Iberostar Bavaro based on the treatment alone in a heartbeat! Samuel, our waiter you were fantastic, I wish you the best! Hope this was helpful to all reading. Any questions, please email me. Thank you!

<Content>Excellent Trip! This trip was fabulous!!! It was definately my favorite vacation I have ever been on. There is something for everyone in any age group. The hotel does an excellent job at posting the weekly schedule of day activities and night shows. The entire staff is extremely happy and friendly and the Star Friends do an absolutely excellent job at getting people involved in the activities. They are always happy, helpful, friendly, energetic and making everyone feel welcomed. The entire Star Friends team: Johnathan, Rueben, Rolando, Hose, Rocky, Cisa, Yamiilia, Jack, and Ostami all work extremely hard. They were there when I went to breakfast and still there when I left the disco in the early hours of the morning. A lot of the staff speaks some English and the nightly show MC and Star Friends speak it very well along with several other languages. The food in the buffets were good along with the food in the specialty restaurants. They had a good selection and presented it well. All of the activities were a lot of fun and there was a great selection of things to do. I didn't leave the resort once...there was so much to do! I had a great time on this trip and didn't want to leave at the end of the week. This is definately a trip worth taking.

<Content>Good, not great My wife, 12 year old daughter and I stayed at the Bavaro June 25th through July 2nd, 2003. This is a condensed trip report. Arrived via US Air (Funjet) to the tropical Punta Cana airport. There was some confusion after the landing as people were going into different directions coming off the plane. Luckily we headed toward the tourist card line and paid 10.00 per person before going to the baggage claim area. We met our VIP rep (Max) and departed soon afterwards to the resort. We were told it would be a 1/2 hour delay before our room was ready. A few people after us received a room right away, No problem, grab a drink and wait. After a half hour we went back to claim our room and were told it would be another half hour. Asked for a different room but he kept repeating a half hour. Ok. Met Max (VIP) and discussed the layout and tours. Max seemed easy distracted, maybe just having a bad day, but we didn't get a lot of useful information from the meeting. Afterwards we walked directly to the room were they just finished cleaning. Nice room (1028) but it was far from all the activities. No problem, we can get a little exercise on the trip. Went for a swim in the pool (very nice) and the ocean (also very nice). The beach did have a number of topless women (which didn't bother me a bit). Although we could have booked 4 nights at specialty restaurants (more w/cancellations), we only booked two. Both the Steakhouse and the Tropical resturants were nothing to brag about so we stuck to the buffets. the buffets offered more options and changed the food selections nightly. Even picky eaters can find something they like or at least can tolerate. The Star friends entertainment team were great, They try to get everybody involved in the acitivities around the pool and the beach. They also perform nightly in the entertainment shows. There is a different show theme every night after the childrens show (and in between dancing). Of the two show we watched, one was pretty good (Las Vegas) the other was very funny(Miss Iberostar). One troubling part of the show is when the American contestants were announced, a number of the French people starting booing loudly. But since there were more American than French, the tide quickly changed and they became more subdued as the Americans replied back. The Starfriends work very hard and it shows. A shout out to Alex from my daughter who had/has a huge crush on him. The tours - Outback Safari trip was very nice and our Daddy did a good job explaining the history and culture of the Dominican people. The horseback riding tour was a disaster. My wife and daughter waited 1 1/2 hours to be picked up and nobody arrived. Max, the VIP rep was very little help. They insisted they came and no one was there even though my wife was sitting on the front stairs. Rebooked for the next day and guess what, same thing happened. After 45 minutes I called max, again very little help, who called back to tell us that no one was there when they came. Finally, VIP sent a taxi to pick my wife and daughter up and deliver them to the ranch a half hour away. Besides waiting in a hot taxi as the driver talked to friends at a shopping mall for 15 minutes, the rest went well. Called Max they day before leaving to find out the pick up time for the airport. He asked us to call VIP because he wasn't sure. Luckily, the checkout went smooth. Paid for the massages and local phone calls and made it to the airport with 3 1/2 hours to spare. Very nice resort with a few impovements could be great.

<Content>Watch out for the Henna Tattoos! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana in June 2003, and have only good things to say about it. Although billed as a five star hotel, you have to remember that Dom Rep is still a developing country, and hence five star in DR is not going to be the same as five star in London or New York. Conversely, you are not paying $350 a night either! For the hotel itself, the room we had was very clean and spacious with a US-sized king size bed (was about 7ft wide!), mini-bar, cable, balcony, air-con, en-suite etc.- pretty much everything you would need. The Iberostar Punta Cana shares its facilities with the Ibersotar Dominicana, and hence for all intents are the same hotel (they have separate receptions, but share bars, restaurants, and entertainment facilities). Also on the same site is the Iberostar Bavaro, although this is treated as a separate hotel, and Punta Cana/Dominicana guest's all-inclusive privileges do not extend thereto (and vice versa). The grounds of the three hotels are immaculately kept, and very pleasant. The Punta Cana/Dominicana has a large pool area with two free-form pools, surrounded by sun-beds and palm shades. Although if you arrive late in the morning you will find that all the best positioned beds have gone, we had no difficulty in finding somewhere every day. Asfor the beach, there were always sun-beds available, as well as a constant cooling breeze. The beach itself was excellent in every respect, clean and spacious, and as within the DR beaches can also be private property (unlike many other Caribbean islands), there were no beach vendors hassling anyone. The wrecked ship on the reef about a mile off shore also added character!Regarding the food, the buffets were OK, but a little bit same-ish every night. In addition to the buffets there are five other restaurants, four of which you need to reserve in advance. Of these, we thought the Steak House was the best, and the Mexican the worst (the Mexican was pretty bad). The tropical restaurant and the gourmet restaurant were OK, and also worth a go once, especially if you are there for two weeks. The fifth restaurant was a rock-cafe style restaurant, and was probably the best of the lot in terms of choice and food quality, and you can just turn up at it. It is a bit out of the way at the back of the resort, however, and so didn't seem to get that many people in there, but it is well worth a visit.We found the drinks OK, and if anything probably a bit too strong on the alcohol side, and especially where they just contained local spirits. The draught lager was OK as well, but local bottled lager was also available. The nightly entertainment was a bit like watching the Eurovision song contest, as everything was said in four languages, but usually with such bad accents that it was hard to tell which language was which. I often found it easier to listen to the French version rather than English, but they do speak English, albeit rather badly. Easily enough to get by, however. If you don't like the show then we found the casino quite good fun as well, especially since the girls there made lots of mistakes, usually in the gambler's favour!One word of warning I must give, however, is on the subject of henna tattoos. There are a few places in the beach markets outside the resort boundaries which purport to give henna tattoos. BEWARE - the substance they use is not natural henna, but is instead a toxic chemical called PPD (which is found in small quantities in some sun-creams and make-up). We only found this out after we got back, when the area where my girlfriend's henna tattoo had been suddenly came up in angry looking red welts, like a chemical burn. After seeking medical advice we found out that this delayed reaction usually happens anytime between 2 and 6 weeks after the tattoo, and that reactions occur in 75% of cases. Once a reaction has occurred then that person will be increasingly sensitive to PPD from then on. Apart from the PPD scare after we got back, overall our holiday at the Iberostar Punta Cana was excellent in every respect, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an all-inclusive style Caribbean beach holiday!

<Content>Best Vacation We Ever Had! We just returned from the most wonderful week at the Iberostar Bavaro, Punta Cana. My husband and I (both 37) traveled with our two kids, one boy-Age 9, and one girl-Age 6. We arrived on June 16th, and departed June 23rd.We successfully used a lot of the information posted here on this site, including requesting a 2nd floor room (not as humid), tipping the maid a few dollars each day (I thought it provided us with better service including receiving a plate of fruit in our room 2 days- but I'm not sure if the $ had anything to do with it, although a couple bucks a day tip couldnt hurt, and the maid was very appreciative). Fyi- if you just leave the money out, like on top of the tv like we did, the maid will know it's for her. We brushed our teeth with bottled water, and for the first few days I even rinsed off the toothbrushes with bottled water. I then used tap water (for rinsing the toothbrushes), and we all continued to be fine, so I guess that's ok to do. All the water served at the hotel is bottled, so it really is not a problem avoiding the tap water.Although we planned on taking the jungle safari and manatee park excursions, we decided we were enjoying our days on the beach too much to go anywhere else! Our kids went to the Mini Club camp, which is located at the Dominicana hotel right next door. They have a full schedule of activities to occupy the kids. The young women who watch the kids are wonderful, very concientous and responsible. They genuinly enjoyed being with the children! The camp runs from 10 -5 daily. You can take your kids out anytime (just follow the activity schedule to see where they are). All campers must be signed in and out by a parent. Interesting to note that kids ages 8 and up can come and go on their own, although the counselors must be told by them when they are with the group and when they are on their own. Even though they have this independence, the counselors will watch them them carefully when they are participating as campers. I was nervous about my son coming and going, but as he is closer to age 10 than 9, and is a pretty smart and responsible kid, it worked out just fine. He hung out at the pool, met some friends, played water polo, played baseball on the beach - he was fine on his own, and would check in with us periodically on the beach. My daughter spent all her days happily with the camp. My only concern with her is her inablility to swim without a flotation device. As it turned out, the smaller kids were kept in the kids pool anyway which is very shallow (maybe 3ft tops) and in the shade. This was a big relief to me! Every evening about 8:15PM the Mini club marches around the show area with a counselor and either dance or participate in a show on stage. Very cute! My daughter loved dressing up as an Arabian Princess for one show, parading around in a fashion show, and performing ballet for the kids talent show! Certificates, shirts and hats are given to the kids as prizes.I cannot say enough about the wonderful food at this hotel! Although you may choose to eat at many of the full service restaurants at this hotel or the two neighbor sister hotels, the buffet dinner was our best bet with the kids. Definitely somehting for everyone and a chance to try new things. Kids relied on old standbys like pizza and fries, but willingly tasted new items. Keep in mind that the buffet doesnt close until 10Pm so we actually found ourselves going back for more later! Even when you eat at one of the specialty restaurants (we ate at the japanese and medditeraniun ones) you can still go and eat later at the main buffet! Dress for the buffet is always casual: shorts are fine. At the specialty restaurants, dress is nicer, men are required to wear pants.One thing we didnt realize is that if you plan on hanging around the hotel all day (pool or beach + acitivities), you can basically just wear a bathing suit, even when eating lunch! We would get up, put bathing suits on and stay in them until dinner!Something I want to mention about the beach- you may borrow snorkeling equipment (goggles and flippers) for up to one hour a day per person free. Also, although the bar and dining areas are not too far a walk, I liked bringing my big jug of water (provided daily in the room) to the beach just to stay hydrated.More than enough employees spoke English so we had no problem. I heard that at other nearby resorts, this was an issue, but we were fine.Beautiful Peacocks, including mommies and babies, strutting around the gorgeous grounds. Who knew they could fly? Every night like clock work they fly up and perch themselves in the trees. Then make a racket squacking for the others to come to bed.We had a wonderful time and plan on going back to this resort, with our children, next year!

<Content>Great Value Vacation Stayed from 4/25/03 to 5/2/03. We traveled as 2 couples leaving the little ones behind this time. Will bring all 7 little ones, between both couples, next time. We loved the suites and couldn't think of anything more you could ask for in the room and room service. There were a good number of young kids at the resort which I found to be a good point for our future travels with our kids. The grounds and facilites were top notch. Possibly the most beautiful beach I've been to. The shallow reefs you could snorkel to close to the beach were good but the bouy lines to protect you from the motorsports kept you from getting out to see some of the good stuff. The water was perfect and the bar on the beach with a deck the best! I learned a new drink and was quick to buy it when I got home called a Caiprinah (hopefully spelled correctly) made with a potent rum from Brazil called Cachaca. Have a few of these and look out! Keep the excursions to a minimum as we did a few and they ate up a lot of time. The 2 we really enjoyed was the snorkeling with the little 2 person power boats and the ATV's out out the ranch. We ate at the specialty restaurants and found the Japanese and Mexican to be the best. Only 2 negatives from the whole week. Buffet food was average(expected when feeding this many people over such a long time span) but could always find something to eat and the extertainment for the adults was mediocre but great for the kids. We found the casino on the smallish side but very nice. Nice to have 3 resorts to use also. I do want to mention the resort has a large number of European and Canadian tourists which I find refreshing as it's always nice to know the world is not all about the USA all the time. Had a nice game of quarters going one night with Dave and Pam from Connecticut and the 2 brothers from Ontario! Just wish some of the Europeans would feel the same about the Americans and at least try a smile or a hello as most of us are decent people and don't bite. Will return for sure with the kids next time. For the $1300 USD per person we spent with air and transfers you'll be hard pressed to find anything that comes close! Enjoy!!!!

<Content>Awesome Place To Stay! This was the nicest place I've ever been to. If you love to relax and enjoy the sun all day, this is the place for you. The people are very nice there and the food was great too! The rooms were nice and spacious and very clean. The scenery is awesome and the groundskeeping is beautiful. If you love the kind of hotels that are right on the beach and there is a pool right by the beach also, you will definately like this place. The pool layout is awesome and a great place to lay out after spending all day on the beach. This is a quiet place and you usually don't have to worry about kids running around all the time. The beach has nice sand and awesome huts you can sit under if you get sick of the sun! All I have to say is that this place is awesome and if you pick this place, you will have an awesome time!

<Content>Excellent Vacation My husband and I traveled for the first time to the Dominican Republic and selected the Ibeostar Bavaro Hotel in Punta Cana. What a fantastic choice. Beautiful hotel, excellent food, top shelf liquor. The staff was friendly and courteous. My only suggestion, learn a little Spanish so you can enjoy the culture more and take the dance lessons offered at the hotel, you won't regret it. WHAT AN EXCELLENT VACATION. We are planning to return next year with our adult children.

<Content>Wonderful resort-had a fantastic time I just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro (6/7-14) with another couple. We all had a really great time. The food was very good and plentiful. The drinks were good; plenty of wine with dinner. We were able to get a reservation for all 7 nights in the specality restaurants - the steak house  Japanese were the best but all were good. The staff at this hotel is very accomodating. There was a language barrier at times but somehow you manage to get through it. The rooms are very nice also. The beach and pool are beautiful with plenty of activities to keep you busy. The shows at night were good (needed more dancing after the show since the Disco was a little on the young side for our age). Overall, I would highly recommend this resort especially for the price you pay. Would definitely return again.

<Content>First Class All The Way We enjoyed two weeks in the Iberostar Bavaro from 20 May-5 June 03. I must say that our stay in this Caribean paradise was wonderful. The facilities were perfect, the service excellent, the food delicious, the ambience inspiring, and the staff friendly and eager to assist. We hated to go and return to reality. I will recomend this place to the most demanding tourists looking for a place to relax, enjoy the sun, the beach, and good food. We will definetely return to this resort.

<Content>Great all-inclusive vacation Took my family on a brief 5 day getaway. The Iberostar Bavaro Suites were the perfect place for a relaxing vacation. The facilities were clean, the staff friendly and very accomodating. The food was great, offering buffets throughout the day and your choice of several specialty restaurants in the evening, including a steak restaurant, Japanese restaurant and seafood restaurant. We tried each of them and were impressed with the food and service. The resort offered nightly entertainment, consisting of music and dance shows, as well as variety entertainment. During the day the resort staff offers activities for guests to participate in. I highly recommend this trip to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway.

<Content>Best vacation I ever had! We went from May 26 to June 2 and all I can say is that this resort blew me away. The weather was sunny and in the 90's the whole week. We had been to Sandals in Antigua and thought that was great but this place is 100 times better and at a MUCH lower cost. The trip was booked through Apple vacations and we had no problems with the airline getting to and from the Dominican. Same with the transfers from and to the airport. The design of the airport gets you in the mood for the beach right away. We checked in a 12:30pm and our room was available at that time. While my husband and the other couple we were on vacation with went to look around, I made reservations for the restaurants. I made the mistake of reserving times at 7:00 or 7:30pm for all four restaurants we wanted to go to. The trouble being is that we got to the beach about 10:30am everyday and didn't leave until about 6:30pm. Needless to say we really didn't want to hurry up to shower and change to go eat so early, so make your reservations for one of the later times. We ended up eating at only two of the restaurants because of this. I tried to change the times but the reservations were all booked already. So we ate at the buffet for five nights and to tell you the truth we all would have eaten at the buffet for seven nights in a row. The food was fantastic. I thought the food selections would be the same everynight but it was different nightly. The food at the restaurants was also very nice. Now about the room, yes it had a very slight musty smell and I did bring air freshner with me but I never had to take it out of my suitcase. No bugs in the room either. The room was large and the king size bed was very comfortable. The beach was so beautiful. Baby powder fine sand and oh the color of that water. There are small reefs about 40 feet off shore were you can snorkle with the equipment you get at the resort. I had a hard time snorkling so I bought a blow up raft, laid across it and did my snorkling that way. Bought a dispo them at home. The nightly entertainment was great so go to the show everynight which starts at 9:45. You will love it. They have a group of young people working at this resort that I can't say enough about. They are called the Star Kids. You will see them at the pool in the morning till late afternoon doing all the planned activities. They will be at and in the shows at night and then they go over to the disco to dance with the resort guests. You will know all their names by the second day of your vacation. The drinks were plentiful and what a selection. The pool was clean and refreshing.This resort gave all four of us the best time we ever had on a vacation. We are going back again next year but this time with alot more people.

<Content>Had a great time This resort was the most beutiful resort I have ever been too. It was simply amazing. the setup was astonishing. The food was good as well, But you cant be a picky eater or drinker if you want to go here. You get what you are paying for this isnt goint to be the best food you have ever eaten or the best drinks but most of the stuff there tastes good. The people there were so nice and every thing was very clean. Much cleaner then I expected. This trip trully is all inclusive, I never felt once compelled to tip like you do in other resorts where they wont serve you unless you tip. The service is so good there that you have to tip though. You really feel like everyone is going out of there way to make sure that you have a good time. If your the type of person where everthing has to be perfect then this may not be for you. But if your a laid back type of person that enjoys the sun, beautiful scenry, lots of activities, and all Inclusive food and drinks Then your going to have an unforgettable experience. Most of you are still probably scatred because of all the bad reviews this place has gotten but I have one word for all those naysayers out there, shoopa. You understand when you get there. Have fun!!! P.S. You do not have to take the catamaran course just make sure the first time you go out on them its not that windy. Oh and watch your head.

<Content>Better than Cancun My family recently vacationed at Iberostar Punta Cana (May 11,2003- May 18,2003) This was by far the best vacation we have ever had. There were 8 of us in our family who went, including my children ages 5 and 10. The staff was very accommodating and the service was wonderful. My children made many friends from other countries while vacationing and very much enjoyed the day care there. My 5 yr old wanted to go every day because they rode donkeys, played tennis and swam and ate in several different hotels along the beach. In fact, he asked if we could go for 72 days next year. Hey, I'm all for it lets pack up and go now, why wait! The shows were wonderful, especially Tuesday night. I have not seen people with so much enthusiasm as the Star Members. I have been to Cancun and I would go to Punta Cana 10 times over that of Cancun, unless all you want to do is go clubbing. The beaches were clean the rooms were clean. The Manati Park was fun, not very big but big enough to hold the interests of 2 children. They swam with the dolphins, held wildlife and watched a few shows. It was well worth the money. It was definitely a family oriented vacation. My kids never once said anything about the topless beach but it may be a problem for others. I'm a nurse so it was pretty natural for them. The only negative comment I have is that the bus rides were horrible for those that are easily nauseated by the motion. This included 3 out of 8 of us. For some, it may be an adventurous thrill ride. We will be going back next year and hopefully will make it a yearly vacation.

<Content>excellent Hi everyone, all the reviews posted in this website really helped us. Our trip was arranged by Apple Vacations and the duration was a week (05/31-06/06). It's pretty much like everybody wrote and here are some suggestions that will make your trip even better. Flight: bring food from your house (at the airport it's too expensive). the flight is about 3 hours and 20 mins. bring something to read or some games. Why? because, Champion does not serve any kind of meal on the flight and there is no TV to watch. They serve soda/juice and a bag of pretzels. remember to do this both ways. once you get to the resort forget everything and relax. enjoy your vacation. Bring sunscreen, bug repellent, after sun lotion, sunburn aid, toothpaste, iron if you don't want tio pay for the service, floater/raft for the pool, loose fitting clothing in case you get sunburn and don't forget to smile. We are a young couple. had a wonderful time in every activity. Please don't miss the night shows. go to the disco. it's really nice. go to the jaccuzi, kayaking and snorkeling. we didn't have any kind of problems and love everything about the resort.

<Content>One word... Fantastic! We spent our honeymoon in Iberostar Bavaro from 13th to 21st May 2003. We simply loved it! We were welcomed upon arrival with lots of friendly smiles and a tropical drink. The friendly atmosphere was present throughout the entire holiday! Very different from what we've experienced on some of our holidays closer to home (Greece, Spain...) People might not make lots of money in the Dom. Rep., but their work is excellent. We were also pleasantly surprised by the all-in formula, which was a completely new experience for us. Great that you can get as many drinks and snacks as you want, 24 hrs a day! Room was very spacious, clean and cool. Bathtub a little smaller than what we're used to, but hey... we weren't planning on spending most of our time in the bathroom anyway! Food in the buffet restaurant was excellent: plenty to choose from, good quality, fresh en beautifully presented. In short: we had the best honeymoon we could imagine! Two slight disappointments though; we expected more from the a la carte gourmet restaurant La Ballena. It was a fixed menu instead of e real a la carte with some starters, main dishes and desserts to choose from, and the quality was not as high as expected. But I guess us Belgians are just spoiled when it comes to excellent food, so... Second nasty blow: telephone and fax costs. Email wasn't working during our stay, a call to Belgium cost 2 USD per minute and a fax 5 USD per page! We couldn't use our cell phone either (different system than in Europe).

<Content>I love Dominican men! I just got back from the Dominican Republic on 5/12 after a week in paradise. It was by far the most fun I ever had on a vacation. The resort was absolutely beautiful and the weather there was perfect everyday. The beaches were to die for with soft white sand and clear blue water. My friend and I joined in with all the Europeans and sun bathed topless for the first time. It was a little awkward the first day but by the second day it felt normal after we realized it wasn't a big deal. The natives were the nicest people I have ever met in my life! EVERYONE greets you with a smile and an hola. The only thing there I wasn't crazy about was the food. I didn't care for the lunch buffets but the restaurants were very good and looked beautiful. My favorite part by far were the entertainment team. I met so many of the guys and looked forward to the nightime shows they put on where they danced up a storm. ( I still don't understand how they can dance so much without passing out from the heat) Before and after the nightly shows we danced with these sexy boys who know how to treat a lady by escorting us by hand to and from our seats. The last night I was there they had a battle of the sexes show where was chosen as one of the contestants. It was so much fun even though all of us onstage were sweating like pigs under the hot lights. And of course the females won! :) I'm so sad to be back to reality in this chilly weather but I have 7 rolls of film from the trip and I plan on writing to all the star friends I met down there. I highly recommend this resort to people of all ages who want to relax and enjoy paradise! I plan on going again as soon as next year!!

<Content>Will Never Go Back! My fiance and I traveled with my sister and her husband to the Dominican Republic and we stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana from April 26 through May 3, 2003.The Resort: The resort was very pretty with all the palm trees and the flamingos. The rooms were nicely sized, however, my sister found two huge bugs in their room on two separate occasions and we found a gecko in our tub one morning. The pools were very nice and big, however, there was NO swim-up bar as stated in the brochures we received, and you cannot help but stay at one, play at two because the Iberostar Punta Cana and Dominicana are just a courtyard jump away from each other. That was disappointing. And depsite what you think, heard or read, the people at the resort DO NOT speak Einglish!! Every night the shows are MC'd in four different languages, the staff hardly speaks a word of English and barely understands it either. And sorry everyone, but after a while, the star friends got really annoying!Saving Beach Chairs: Let me tell you that after the first day when we had no problems finding chairs, we thought that all the reviews about saving chairs were over-exagerations -- WRONG!! The next day we found a lonely chair underneath a palm umbrella with a towel draped off the back of it and after encouragement and help from a star friend we moved three other vacant seats to that umbrella because as the signs clearly read (in four different languages) -- No Reserving Chairs Allowed. Well, needless to say, almost two hours later we had a run in with a German man, who to make a long story short, cursed us for being Americans and grabbed a towel because this was supposedly his area.The Food: We were very disappointed with our meals. We ate in four of the specialty restaurants and usually at least one of us liked something about our meals, but we were never really totally pleased wtih what we had. The buffets were practically food the same every day at all the meals with norom the hamburgers as recommended by so many, but I also have to disagree with those who said that the ice cream at the beach was the best ever -- I've had much better ice cream!!The Drinks: This was another sore spot for us, because unless you watched the bartenders or specified you wanted alcohol in your drinks it was often times forgotten and you had to remind them that you wanted rum in your pina colada. You cannot get good tequila there so stay away from the margaritas, tequila sunrises, etc. Also, if the bartenders do not know what is in a drink, we found out that they will substitute Bailey's for what they don't know. We wanted a midori sour (melon liquor and sour mix). The bar tender acted like he knew what I wanted and came back with a drink that looked disgusting....after trying to break the language barrier, he brought back a bottle of baileys and said that's what he used. Another night, my sister tried to get a cosmopolitan...the waitress asked Baileys?...uh...no. Also, they will not make you any drinks that are not on their menu. We asked for a mudslide and the bartender said that if it's not on the menu they cannot make it. We told him that was funny because we persuaded a bartender to make long island iced teas the day before and were asked who that bartender was because he could get in trouble for it. Even the beer wasn't good!None of us got extremely sick from the food or water, but none of us felt quite right either. The resort says that they use purified water for all the food and ice, but you can't really be sure of that. If you really want to play it safe, the best drinks are your bottled water and wine.Not all was lost, we very much enjoyed the Outback Jungle Safari with Monchie as our tour guide, and it was nice to be away from the resort for a while. We used the resorts kayaks one day, but didn't realize that to use the catamarans that you need to pay for a course and then can use the equipment for one hour a day. Should've checked into that flight like we did, you are able to keep your room for $20 per person only until 3:00 p.m. or use their hospitality room which is a big room open to the public with two bathrooms (with showers), a bunch of shelves and no airconditioning (not very private). Neither option appealed to us and we chose to drink wine and play poker and blackjack in the hotel lobby bar (using our own cards not in the casino) for almost four hours until our bus came to pick us up to go to the airport. That was the longest four hours of our lives!Would we go back -- no way! Would we recommend it to anyone -- only our worst enemies!!

<Content>Paradise Everyday We would definitely highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro. The accommodations were top notch, as well as the services and food. Some definite recommendations would be to bring your own insulated oversized cup/mug for drinks to keep out sand, keep it cold or hot, and be able to recognize your drink from someone else's. The first thing you should do when you get there is make reservations for your specialty restaurant dinners. If you are there 7 nites, you get 3 specialty restaurants. We chose the japanese restaurant, our favorite, the Mediteranean, and the SteakHouse. Other meals are either eaten at the buffet off the lobby, or by the pool. Buffet hours are 7-10 a.m, 12:30-3:30, 6:30-10:00, but there are always buffets around the pool, as well as hot dogs and french fries at the beach. With the Bavaro bracelet, you can go eat at any of the Dominicana or Punta Cana restaurants as well (12 total). But if you get the Dominicana and Punta Cana resort bracelets, you can only eat at those resorts, respectively. The Star Friends, activity organizers, are a very fun and happy bunch willing to get you going on activities if you want to. The other important thing to do is to sign up for the free one hour of non-motorized watersports each room is allowed a day. This sign up house is way down the beach past the gymnasium and is at the end of the beach walkway in a yellow shack just toward the water from the Steakhouse Punta Cana. You can sign up for a kayak, catamaran, paddleboat, windsurfer, and snorkeling gear. We brought our own snorkeling gear, but signed up for the catamaran 4 days in a row. It was great and very stable. Windsurfers were almost impossible to get upright and go any distance due to wind and waves. Wherever there is aqua water there is a sandy bottom, but if it is darker there is coral that can scratch knees, feet, etc. so stay in the aqua areas for swimming. Each night there is a show in the bar near the lobby at 9:45 after the daily activity winners get a T-shirt or prize at 9:30 p.m. Aftena Disco, but we heard it was very loud and smokey. There was a new bar opening up the day we left 3/11/03 at the cafe next to the Disco that has a Chevy Impala inside and was going to have live bands playing nightly. That seemed more our speed (we're in our 40's) The weather was excellent. Everyday sunny 85 and every night 75, it rained for about 10-15 minutes two of the seven days during the day and rained for about 30-45 minutes at night time about 3 nights which was never really a bother. The activity board near the pool tells you what activities will be held throughout the week you are there. If you don't know where something will take place, ask a Star Friend, they are really helpful. We took plenty of $1 bills to give as tips to the bartenders, maids, Star Friends, etc. because they really work hard to make things nice for you. The night life was the only weak link here, but I think with the new entertainment at the Dominicana La Petite Cafe, things may change. Everything is always clean and picked up and the wildlife is very beautiful all around the grounds-Pelicans, Peacocks, Geese, birds, ducks, etc. Some star friends that spoke English were Sexy Johanna, Alex, Edu, and Antonio, but all were playful and tried to get you to have fun. I had to take the spanish class for a couple of days, 10:30 near pool, so I would know how to tell the maid a few things and ask simple questions. Beach Towels are supplied by towel cards that can be exchanged each day for new clean towels. The beach chairs say no reserve, but everyone reserves them by about 7 a.m. with a towel and bag, book or magazine of some kind so they can get one under a palm tree type cabana. The beach is smooth and excellent, no shells to cut your feet or creatures floating up or jellyfish etc. and you can walk for miles and miles, it seems endless in both directions. If you want to buy things from the Dominicans on the beach, don't pay their initial price, bargain down quite a bit, they won't give up until they can sell you something. Beach massagesack, arm and neck massage in your beach chair or go to the middle of the beach for their massage table or they have a massage house located behind the gymnasium. It cost me $40 for a full massage, but that was at the house behind the gymnasium, which I was told was cheaper than on the beach in front of the Bavaro, but who knows for sure. Do remember to take Tums, Gas-X, Pepto  Immodium because you may need it. After 4 days I got some cramping and would get it after meals now and then. My husband got diarhhea after the 5th day and took the Immodium. Don't drink the room tap water and brush your teeth with the bottled water from the mini bar. Also bring your own water bottle so you can refill it for walks on the beach etc., cause the bottle in the room is about a half gallon water bottle. The mini bar beverages are refilled every other day, so let the maid know what you drink so they can replenish what you like and I gave them shiny presents from the dollar store, like a jewelry box, and gave them a couple of dollars other days left on the pillow with a note saying their name and muchas gracias. The horseback riding on the beach at sunset looked great from 5:30-7 and cost $30 per person. I would also recommend one of the snorkeling excursions because you will see more exotic fish that just in front of the Bavaro resort. But there are some tropical fish that hide down in the coral crevices. Hope this helps you have a great trip. We went from 3/4/03-3/11/03.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation This was a great resort! Traveled to several other all-inclusives in the caribbean and this was by far one of the best. Great weather (even though said it would rain every day) Beautiful beach, landscaping and resort. There was plenty of activities to do for all during the day: volleyball, watergames, horseshoes, bocce ball, pingpong, catamarans, kayaks etc. ALso had one of the most extensive nightly entertainment programs I have seen. Highly recommend it.

<Content>Incredible My husband and I just returned from 2 weeks at the Iberostar Bavaro (April 26 - May 10/03). It was our second time in the Dominican and our first vacation in 5 years. What can we say about the resort, staff, facilities, beach, food, drink other than it was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Firstly, our room was just behind the beach and when we woke up on Sunday after arriving and stepped outside the door I looked and there was the beach (our balcony faced the other side). And what a beautiful beach. The room was excellent. The food in the buffet restaurant catered to all culinary tastes and there was plenty of it. We had breakfast there every morning, omeletes made to order etc. The speciality restaurants were also wonderful. The best (in our opinion) was the Gourmet Bellini right across from the Buffet. We dined their twice. The Dorada (Meditteranean) was very good. The only small dissappointment was the Steak House but then everyone has there own way of doing steaks. The Lobby Bar was excellent and a great place to go for cocktails before dinner and after.the shows that were put on were wonderful. We felt the most enjoyable part of the shows was when they did the children's show first. Watching the kids in ages from 2 - 12 was fun. Everyone was always smiling and very helpful. One thing we learned is that when you ask for a Pina Colada or any other fancy drink to ask them to put alcohol in them (as they have the base mix for those who do not like alcohol). So Pina Colada with MUCHO RUM. People have mentioned about the women going topless on the beach (European). Well wants you see two you've seen them all and you never really notice it. We never did get to the pool (water too warm) but we had our regular spot on the beach every day (I snuck down early in the morning to place towels -not supposed to but everyone else did). The beach is kept clean and of course the patrons respect this. The resort is set up like a village with cobblestone walkways leading to all rooms. The resort was built on a national park anmingos and numerous bird species everywhere. I would recommend this beautiful getaway to anyone and cannot figure out people who have sent in reviews rating this as a 1 when in fact it shoud be considered a 7*+.OLA to the Iberostar Bavaro and the wonderful staff.

<Content>Never wanted to leave I had an amazing time!! Every day I look at one of the hand paintings that I bought (which is hanging on my wall) and it makes me think about Dominican Republic...I want to go back already and I just took my trip in January. I went for a week with my boyfriend (we're 22)...and it was the first trip I've ever taken off the East Coast, I would definately recommend it. The costs were good and everything in the hotel was all-inclusive..room..meals..drinks..etc. We did take on a few excursions, which do cost extra..but some are REALLY worth the $$. We had no problems, the people were very friendly and they do try so hard to speak English, but it makes it better if you try to learn a few spanish sayings as well :) Out of a score up to 10, it definately gets a 9. Good weather, the water is crystal clear, and the atmosphere is enjoyable...it's what you make of it...you can have a good time just sitting on the beach or you can do everything!!

<Content>Top Notch Resort! MY husband and I just returned from an amazing week in the Dominican. (Apr.27-May4th) We have stayed at a Sandals in Jamaica ( 6 golden apple), the Sandals in Bahamas ( 6 golden apple), and an Iberostar in Playa Del Carmen in Mexico. This place honestly blew any of them away. We have found the ultimate tropical resort. The food was wonderful, the people exceptionally sweet, and our room well kept, and stocked with beer ( we left a $20 at the beginning of the week with our cleaning lady, needless to say, we were taken care of!!) You do not need to tip, lot's of people don't, but really, what a $5 bill means to us, and what it means to these hard working people, is a world of difference. You will get really exceptional service no matter what, we just feel it's appropriate to tip to assure proper service, and we were right. The beach here is stunning, great snorkeling just within the swimming ropes, saw a 4 ft. long Barracuda our last day :) We brought our own snorkeling gear, but you can take the dive center's for an hour a day free. The Dressel Dive Center was also very impressive. These people were very courteous, explained everything thoroughly, and we were lucky enough to be taken to the wreck on our first dive with Fred. Very friendly staff there, Kevin the videographer was excellent as well. Overall, I can't imagine where anyone can say this place wasn't great. There was always someone cleaning, and smiling at the same time.(rare, rare, rare...) The buffets were stunning, the beach was amazing, and the service was great. What a wonderful place, we will be taking our 3 kids there next year for sure!!

<Content>Loved the Iberostar Bavaro We traveled to Punta Canta during our springbreak this year March 16 - 22, 2003. There were 4 of us which included our children which are older, ages 16 and 22. We figured it would be our last family vacation since everyone is growing up. We have traveled to other beach resort areas and were quite impressed with the helpfulness of the employees, the cleanliness of the rooms, the size of the rooms and all the wonderful food available 24 hours a day at our hotel. The Iberostar Bavaro was beautiful, helpful staff, clean rooms and the extra's each day in our room made us feel like royalty. Flower petals were strategically placed on our towels and washcloths each day. One day arriving back from the beach were two plates of sliced fresh fruit and rum. On another occasion there were a beautiful bouquet of fresh tropical flowers. We were never without something to do if we chose to join in. Upon arrival we were told that the previous guests had not moved out of our scheduled room, but the hotel was quick to put us in a room that was even closer to the beach than our original room and we were only delayed 10 minutes. I was actually glad it happened since the rooms were closer to the beach. We went to a few of the specialty restaurants and loved them, but decided to do the buffet the rest of week so that we would not have to schedule our day around the reservation time. There was so much variety of food to choose from. Anything you could imagine and the staff was always filling our drinks of beverage. Almost like we had our own personal waiter on a buffet line. The Dominincan Republic is a beautiful place to relax and plenty to do. We did one tour to a secluded island, which we wished we had just stayed at the hotel. We have traveled extensively and really had seen similar things in other areas. But, would recommend it if your traveling has been limited. The tour staff was very considerate and made sure everyone had fun. My family loved the Dominican Republic!

<Content>A Real Relaxing Vacation Just returned from the Iberostar Punta Cana during Easter week. My family had a wonderful vacation. We have travelled extensively and found this to be one of our best vacations.We have previously enjoyed cruising, but this trip was far more relaxing. No dressing up for dinner, admittedly the food is not the same high quality, but you are not faced with a bar bill at the end of your trip.We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite near the pool and beach. The room was beautifully tiled, 1 king size bed in one room and 2 double sized beds in the other with a TV in each room (many English speaking shows). The shower was very nice with good water pressure, as opposed to the toilet which did not. Not too much of a problem though.The beach was fantastic. The sand is like that in Bermuda, soft and pink. You must rise early to obtain lounge chairs under a palm umbrella. A good idea to bring lightweight towels from home to identify your spot. There are signs posted not to reserve chairs, but nobody pays attention to that. The water is clear blue and this time of year we had little waves which we enjoy jumping in.The pool and grounds are beautiful. Plenty of room for everyone even though it was a popular week. As you walk the grounds you see flamingos, ducks, chickens and peacocks.THe food we were surprised to find was quite good. I enjoyed the Spanish rice and fish dishes. The barbeque on the beach on Tuesday was delicious. There was always pasta available with several sauces. There was also pizza which my daughter did not like. There is always expresso available and the cafe au lait is also very good.A great vacation, I highly recommend this resort.

<Content>Not a luxury trip! Spent a week at the Iberostar Bavaro. The facilities were overall fair...room was fine. No clocks and the power went off whenever the room was empty. Pool was fairly dirty. Food was absolutely horrible. We were with a group of nine, and most of us lived on pasta for the entire week. It is very inexpensive, and you definitely get what you pay for. If you are fairly well traveled, you will probably not like this place.

<Content>What is the truth? I read reviews on this site prior to vacationing and had very mixed feelings because I saw both very bad and good reviews. The bad reviews made me paranoid that the trip would be a disaster. I am pleased to report that the trip was very good and I don't think our experience was rare. You have to keep this review in the context of what you are paying for this vacation and your expectations. Resort: The resort is beautiful. You can read and view the details on several websites. There were a few bug bites in our party but nothing significant. Rooms: The rooms are nice in appearance but when you look closely they are constructed cheaply. So if you care about the quality of the materials used to constuct the room or if you are used to marble bathrooms, this isn't the place for you. If you don't mind a cheaply made door, lamp, etc. and want to pay $1200 USD a week including air for a very good all inclusive vacation, then this is the place for you. The room has all the basics and includes a regularly stocked in room refrigerator. Service: The maid service was fantastic. Front desk, restaurant and bar service was very good (ie. one small notch lower). Things generally work out best when the guests treat the employees with the same respect with which they want to be treated. We regularly tipped employees $1USD. Language: The language spoken in the DR is Spanish. Despite this, many of the employees appear to have made significant efforts to learn English. Take a spanish dictionary and learn a few words. Beach and pool: The beach, pool and ocean are great. You can do some average snorkeling right off the beach. There was some minor seaweed one day but nothing significant. Activities: The activities were endless. They have a group of young employees that work about 16hours a day to bring all types of games and entertainment. The entertainment is like roughly of budget cruise quality.Drinks: The quality is above average for non-premium drinks. Again you have to put lent of $12 USD martini's in New York. They have all the basic carribean type mixed drinks. They also have some premium liquors at the lobby bar and the casino. If you ask around, there are a few different beers.Casino: Not much to talk about if you really want to gamble. However, if you want to toss a few coins into a slot machine, you can have some fun. Food: The food is not the best you will ever have but the food is good in the context of what you are paying. This was probably the thing that I was most concerned about. However, they delivered on exactly what they promised. There is a buffet with chicken, steaks, pork, fish, salad bar, cooked vegtables and starches etc. The specialty restaurants are not awesome but the food is decent. There were some minor stomach aches among 2 members of our party but nothing major. I didn't see any unsightly food preperation. If you eat and drink indiscriminantly and you have a weak stomach, you may have some minor issues. We only drank bottled water. Tips:Get a remote control from the front desk.Best liquor at lobby bar and casino.Exchange your towels for new ones at the end of the day.Make restaurant reservations early.You can ask for bottled beer including a bohemian beer and soberano. Biggest cons: Chair saving is rampant at both the beach and pool and can get quite annoying. The restaurant reservation system may become frustrating if you let it.

<Content>2nd Honeymoon The hotel and its grounds were beautiful. My wife and i stayed at the bavaro april 4th thru 11th. We had an awesome time. the people are really nice. The nightime shows are great. the food is really good, they have a large selection to choose from. Some of the drinks(alcholic) are good, but others are just ok. our overall trip we rated as excellent.

<Content>Got Married Hello everyone. I never write reviews but considering I was married at this resort I figured I better. My vacation was January 5 -12. Never do that again. It rained and the weather was low 20's. But when you are going on a trip and spending lots of money you want warm weather. I thought the wedding would be beautiful from what everyone described at the resort and travel agency. It was a disaster. They had nothing set up, nothing organised. My guests were sick from the food. It was not a place for all my friends to be. We are not crazy party animals but would have liked some fun. Its an older crowd. So grandmas and grandpas had a good time. A note to anyone getting married GO TO MEXICO. Mexico is cheaper and you get the best treatment and the best resorts for the money you pay. Plus there is so much to do for everyone. My friend just got married there, her wedding was amazing (EVERYTHING). Just hope this helps some of you.

<Content>Not What I Thought We stayed at Iberostar Bavaro March, 15-22, 2003. We were pleasantly surprised when the bus that was chartered to pick us up at the airport pulled up to the front of the Bavaro. The general area leading up to the resort is apalling - trash everywhere on the road and some wild drivers out there too. Once inside of the Iberostar resort complex, forget seeing trash or anything messy. Workers were all around constantly cleaning up or doing general maintenance on the grounds. I have to admit that there were alot of the motorized vehicles on the resort's paths- (they were there to make the guests stay more enjoyable). Since this is not a Saturday to sat or sunday to sunday resort, guests were contantly arriving and leaving. The beach was groomed every morning and kept clean of cups and debris. The food was excellent but a note to all --- Bring pepto bismol and immodium. We went here with 6 adults and 2 infants- 4 of the adults got sick. I don't think it was the food being bad- it was just different from what we Americans are used to. They use alot of oils to cook and I think this was the problem. I didn't get sick. Make reservations at restaurant early--- The steakhouse was good, the gourmet (eat somewhere else), mexican (not like mexican food- carribean mexican-- try somewhere else), Japanese (not bad). I really liked the buffet- they had lots of food and it was varied all the time. spend the extra and stay here. U won't be sorry

<Content>All that a vacation is supposed to be ! My wife and I have been to nine resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean and our week spent in February at the Iberostar Punta Cana was the best.There are the usual activities and play equipment available. You can do as much or as little as you please. The employees seem to be genuinely happy that you are their guests. You are NOT a job to them. They were a big part of our enjoyment.The choice of restaurants is more than ample. Breckfast and lunch are buffet with almost unlimited choices that are fresh, top quality and well presented. Dinner can be buffet or at one of their three ala carte restaurants ( by reservation ). We never felt rushed or crowded.Down at the beach the snack buffet is great. You can even get yourself a bag of popcorn. There is also an ice cream parlor at the beach.There is a reef within swimming distance that has fish and decent snorkling.The side trips that we took were to Santo Domingo,the capital. It takes about 3 hours each way on a bus. It makes for a LONG day. You will see a lot of the country and learn about the people. The shopping is abundant there also. However, on Wednesday evening a lot of the same stuff will be available at the resort when some storekeepers come in. You really bargin.The second trip is the Boat Adventure and Bavaro Splash. Very good snorkling and it only takes about a half day from your vacation.Extras to bring to the hotel: a few plastic hangers ( there is rarely enough ) and some pants hangers; plastic bags in case you have a lot of stuff that is wet on the last day; some single U.S. dollars ( there is no need to tip but sometimes you just want to ). We drank the bottled water and had no stomach problems. It is probably smart to bring some Pepto Bismol, in case.It is basis politeness to start each conversation with a friendly greeting. In Spanish if possible. They are happy to help you with words.My informal survey found that if there was a noisy guest during the day or in the halls at night it was usually one of my fellow Americans. Nuff said. Abr Bavaro is right next to the Punta Cana. It is all suites, and costs more, but would be better for families. There is more room and extra wash up facilities.I can remember nothing negative except having to leave after a week. We will return next year.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! We stayed in the Iberostar Bavaro from February 20- 27, 2003. We had an amazing time. In our family there is 3 girls ( 16- 19) and one boy who is 14. We arrived at the airport which was soo cute expecially compared to a lot of other Carribean places. Just a tip, mark your luggage well. It ended up taking us almost an hour to find our luggage. It was really disorganized and stressfull. But we got everything so it all worked out fine. Our ride to the resort was a bit scary. Our driver didn't speak english and also he didn't seem to have a drivers licence. But we got there safely. On our way we stopped at a few other resorts to let people off and the iberostar was by far the nicest we saw. No hassles checking in and we were given a welcome drink. Considering the resort is villas and a distance away from the lobby we were given a hand bringing our bags to our rooms in a little golf cart. Our rooms were very Carribean looking and colorful. At night it was very cold since the air conditioning is on all day. DON'T LEAVE YOUR DOOR OR PATIO DOOR OPEN!! Me and my sisters learned this the hard way. A really disgusting huge bug got into our bathroom and we had quite a time getting it out. haha. Also do not leave anything valuable out. The maids do a really good job cleaning the room but little things (cigarettes) went missing. There is safes in the room, use them. Our first night there was really disapointing. We arrived at the disco waaay too early. Do not go until about 11:45 . Just before 12 they start to do all the Dominican line dances which are alot of fun. And then after that the music is really good. The only thing is they will not give you shots. But it doesn't really matter because their rum and cokes are basically 3/4 rum. That goes for most of their drinks. Especially if your a girl! For dinner the Japanese restaurant was really good. We would also recomend the steak house. The beach there was like right off a post card. The sand was extremely white, way nicer than Jamaica. And the ocean was a reof Europeans staying at this resort and so you will see alot of girls walking around top less on the beach. For activities, there is something going on all day long. We would recomend the water arobics, beach volleyball, soccer and the dance lessons (this is where you will learn the line dances). At night defnitley go watch the nightly entertainment. It was really well done. There is something different every night and everyone goes and watches it. We would also recomend doing the horse back riding. It is just down the beach from the resort. It is not included but it is defnitey worth your money. We would suggest to go around 6 pm and then on your way back you will see the sun set. They take you down the beach. The weather was even better than we expected!! WEAR SUNSCREEN!!! Our family doesn't have a problem with burning usually, but on our last day we noticed we were peeling on places we'd never thought we'd burned. The average weather was between 30- 35 degrees C. It only rained at night and it was a nice rain since it was sooo humid. For any teenage girls, be careful who you trust when it comes to Dominican guys.They are nice guys and alot of fun during the day but at night they are only out to get one thing from niave tourists. There is a market down the beach, you'll see what we mean when you see the vendors. We have toured around alot of the Carribean and this was one of our fave places. We would defnitley recomend this!! I hope this info helped you.

<Content>Fantastic! We arrived at the Iberostar Barvaro on March 1,2003 late at night, but so happy to be there as we left Wisconsin's cold weather. There were 35 of us in our group. I'm sure it was one of the largest groups they have had, and we were all ready to enjoy the beautiful surroundings. The check-in went very smooth, and we were in our room fairly quick. The suite was very nice, with a large king-size bed and large sitting room.The bath was great, complete with bidet. The only thing the suite lacked was dresser drawers (only one). The closet had plenty of shelves for storage and large hanging area. There was also a balcony,but the air conditioning went off when the door was opened. The rooms had a musty odor, but we brought an air freshener which helped a great deal. I would suggest also taking dryer conditioner sheets to put in the drawer and closet to keep clothes from smelling musty. The rooms were equipped with 110 amp service so an adapter isn't necessary. The bath has a hair dryer, but I brought one anyway and was glad because the theirs didn't have a great deal of power. The next day we did our exploring of the grounds. The pool was fantastic--very large and plenty of seating, but get there early for the prime spots. We had one of the group keep our towel cards and early each morning she would put the towels over the chairs. We never had a problem with anyone taking them. The restaurtants are wonderful. The buffet was the mornings pleasure. So many choices--a diner's heaven. The fresh fruit was delicious as were the breads. We all decided we could eat bread 24-7. There is also a buffet by the pool for those who choose to eat breakfast after 10:00 am as the other restaurant closed at 10:00. The food by the pool was just as good. The pool area also was the place for lunch. Once again many choices and each day one area served something different.We were told to make sure the burgers were well done, and no one got sick due to the food. As anywhere out of the States, don't drink the tap water. There is plenty of bottled water or filtered water. The rooms are supplied with a gallon bottle. The days were filled with plenty to do, if you choose. The Star Kids keep everyone busy. Dance lessons, Spanish lessons, aerobics (land and water), archery, water polo, bingo, and many more things to do. Some of the activities are competitive and awards are given at the evening shows. We made friends with several of the Kids,Edu (who I called Ed, because I kept forgetting how to pronounce his name), Alex (who was in love with one of our girls), Matilde (who kept encouraging us to play) and one of the waitresses, Maricia (who kept us happy at our cocktail hour).They are all very friendly and helpful. In fact everyone who worked there was great. The only thing we wished they would have had was pool service for drinks. We had to get our own, eitherwalking to the bar or swimming over. We found out the day before we left that we could have requested one of the waiters to service us. But it was okay. The drinks are heavily poured, but you can get them virgin or ask for less licquor. We didn't mind and got our money's worth. The evenings were fun. Because we had such a large group the hotel gave us a special dinner the evening after we got there. It was very good with a set menu of steak or fish. That was a nice surprise and the only night all 35 of us ate together. We enjoyed most of the restaurants, especially the Gourmet. Make reservations right away when you get there as they fill up quick. The only restaurant we didn't try was the Mediterrenan, only because our reservation was so late and it was buffet which we felt we could get at the Buffet restaurant and have just as good if not better food. We liked the Japanese, but its definitly Japanese so if you don't like sushi, you might want to skip it. The Buffet restaurant was never a disappointment, and we could have eaten there each night as there was always something different.I enjoyed the wine servered at all meals and there was never a lack of it. There are other restaurants at the other hotels, but we were happy to stay at the Baravo. After dinner we went to the bar to watch the shows.Each night the Star Kids put on a different show and we enjoyed each one. They are very talented people, who work long hours as they are also out there each day. No excess weight on these people!I wish I had half their energy. Some of the group went to the Disco which is at the Punta Cana hotel (just a short walk) and enjoyed that also. Needless to say each night we slept well. The group went on the Outback Safari, which is one of the tours that are offered. These are paying tours and this one was $75 per person. I didn't go because I came down with a nasty sore throat and cold the day before and didn't feel well enough to spend the day on a bus. Everyone said it was fun,and educational. They take you to a typical native home and you realize how poor the country is. You also go to a place for rum tasting and cigar buying. Then you can swim in a river that feeds into the ocean. I was told it was very refreshing after the hot bus ride. Then you swim in the ocean and bugey board. Girls, wear a one piece suit and guys, make sure your suit has a strong string tie. One of the guys put on quite a show after a wave hit him and he came up with his suit around his ankles. Sorry I missed that!There isn't a great deal of shopping. The waterfront bazzar is okay for gift shopping and buying t-shirts and cheap jewerly. They are willing to bargain with you and you can get some good buys. The only place to buy really good jewerly is Harrisons, and they will also somewhat bargin. I purchased a Larimar (the gem of the island) ring and paid a reasonable price. The hotel stores are pricey, and they don't bargain much. The only thing we didn't like were all the small children, but thats a European thing and we tolerated it. I figure when you want to enjoy your vacation, don't bring the kids! I didn't see too much to keep them entertained and the parents seemed to think everyone else should watch their kids for them. We saw several small toddlers in the pool with no parent near them. Pretty scary for us Americans to watch. All good things must come to an end and we all wanted to stay (especially since the temps in Wisconsin were below zero). We had a late flight and check out is at noon, so we had to leave our luggage at the front entrance and they locked our carry-ons in a room with everyone elses. It was very safe and you couldn't get in without your check-out pass. If you want to take a shower before you leave, take it before you check out as there are only four shower rooms to be used after check out and the line takes forever. One of the men in line knocked on one of the doors to hurry up a woman who took forever. My husband was the one she yelled at when she finally came out and he wasn't the one who knocked! So be mindful of other people in line and only take a few minutes in there. Most of us choose to wait until we got home. The airport is small and always crowded. Our plane was late due a snowstorm in Milwaukee so we were all pretty tired when we got home, but the memories of the trip helped keep our spirits up. All in all, we would difinately go back.

<Content>I Definitley Won't Go Back!! The beach was beautiful - the grounds were nice but other than that HUGE disappointment! The drinks were the worst I have ever had anywhere! The food was on the weak side as well, they couldn't of used any less quality anywhere. The rooms were dirty, terrible plumbing. In the future I'll pay for service and good food/drinks .... when it sounds too cheap, IT IS!

<Content>Beautiful resort We just had 5 great days at the Iberostar, Punta Cana. The grounds and resort were absolutely gorgeous. The service was great. The Dominicans really take pride in the resort.The beach was beautiful! As nice or nicer than any in the Caribbean.I didn't have high expectations for the food, but when I got to the buffet I found the variety was so huge there was enough for everyone tastes.I actually preferred the buffet over the sit down.The Rum Raisin ice cream was the best! and of course those fruit drinks are great.Definitely take precautions with the water. I had some uncomfortable hours. not sure if it was the lobster at the Gourmet rest. the night before. But still be careful.The prices in the gift shops are very reasonable.I found the vendors on the beach not as bad as I anticipated, but the deals are better in the hotel gift shops.We also went to Manati park to swim with the dolphins. That was the best part of the trip. Although expensive and too short, the thrill was worth it. Definitely follow the advice of the Apple Vacation people. It pays to go with a package. The all inclusive at bavaro is the highest on the food chain you get your choice of any restaurant.All in all, one of the best relaxing vacations I've ever had.Tip: If you bring kids ,the cable isn't that extensive, so bring books, crayons, etc. The gift shop was disppointing as far as kids stuff goes.Also, bring your own hairdryer. The ones in the room don't cut it in the humidity.

<Content>Incredible Iberostar The sun and sand were what we'd gone for! The water activities (sail boats, catamarans, kayaks) were all in good condition and the sailing over the waves was a blast. All the people we met were friendly and helpful and loved it when you tried their language (Spanish). There was an incredible array of food, all presented beautifully. The rooms were roomy and flowers each day was a nice surprise. The excursion we elected was an eye-opener as to how life really is in the Dominican Republic. As far as Punta Cana and the Iberostar hotels, we would definitely go back.

<Content>This is THE place to stay! This was our first experience at an all-inclusive resort. We stayed at the Iberostar Barvaro from 2.16 - 2.23 and I cannot say enough nice things about the place, the people, the activities and the food. The Iberostar Corporation is European, so there's a wonderful European sensibility to the place. Don't go here if all you want to do is sit on a beach and read a book. That would be a waste of all the resources to be had at this wonderful resort. The staff is cheerful and will try just about anything to get you involved in the tremendous variety of activities. DO play bingo every day (you'll learn numbers in at lest four languages), DO take the dance lessons, DO go to the live entertainment every night and DO get up on stage and dance like nobody's watching!! Try soccer, volleyball as well. Do take expando-pants, though. The food is VERY good, and if you can get away from this delightful resort without adding to your waist line, you've got much better discipline than I have! I will definitely go back.

<Content>Great Place Iberostar Punta Cana is a friendly, fun resort. The people are great and go out of there way to make it as pleasant as possible for you. The weather is perfect as well as the beaches too. Activities going on all the time. Remember it's what you make of it also. A little Spanish might help but if not, between two people you will figure it out and it will be fun doing so. I would recommend this resort to anyone. Remember to tip the workers it's not an easy living in Dominican Republic. Live it up. Can't wait to return someday.

<Content>Best Trip Ever I stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana from January 9-January 19, 2003. It was wonderful!! The beach is absolutely gorgeous, the water is so warm and clean, the resort is incredibly clean and the staff are excellent. The weather was amazing the entire 10 days. There is always a variety of activities going on during the day on the beach and by the pool and the entertainment staff always get you involved. The excursions were amazing -- especially Saona Island!!! It's a must see!! The shows at night are always entertaining and the dancing is wonderful. The dancers are amazing and always get you involved. The Disco on the resort is great!! The food is excellent!! This was the best trip I've ever had!!! I would go back in a heartbeat and I would recommend it to anyone who is planning a trip to Punta Cana!!

<Content>What a great vacation!! I just returned from a glorious week in the Dominican Republic. I well traveled and can say that this was a wonderful all inclusive experience. This is the second Iberostar that I have stayed at, the other being in Playa de Carmen. I did extensive research before selecting the Iberostar Bavaro and was not disappointed. This is not one of the newer Iberostars however was just as beautiful in many ways. The lobby is very pretty and the grounds are lush with greenery and flowers. This is a 2 story hotel and there are about 8-10 rooms per building. I loved the layout of the hotel. There is a main pool area with a swim up pool bar however, the pool is not nearly impressive as the newer Iberostars and could use a paint job. On the plus side, it is large and the walk from the pool to the beach is 30 seconds. There were 6 of us in our group: Two in their 30's, one in their late 40's, two in their 50's and one in their 60's. If you are a finicky eater, like my parents, you will always have a tough time eating on vacation in another country, although they were content with the food. The rest of us were thrilled with the food. There was always a wide variety, plenty of fish, sushi, everything. This resort is attached to 2 other Iberostars, the Punta Cana and the Dominicana. The Bavaro is considered a 5 star and the others are a 4 star. The Bavaro had a nicer buffett with higher quality food - more seafood. If you stay at one of the 4 stars you cannot eat at the Bavaro but if you stay at the Bavaro you have access to all restaurants on property. There are approximately 8 specialty restraunts that are more a la carte and with a 7 night stay you have 3 nights you can eat at the specialty restaurants. We ate at the Japanese, Gormet and Seafood, and all of which were very good. The Gormet only was serving Filet Mignon that week, which we were advised of when we made the reservation on that being the special of the week for that resaurants. It was excellent. In the seafood restaurant we had tthe Japanese - another excellent choice. Other restaurants included the Mexican, Steak House and Mediteranean. I went in high season and had no trouble getting reservations. Make your reservations for the specialty restaurants as soon as you arrive because they will fill up. The main buffett for dinner is very impressive and has many options from hot dogs to roasted lamb to a salad station. The rooms were junior suites at the Bavaro and had a step down living room. Each room has a balcony with a couch and table. There is a stocked fridge in the room as well with sodas, water and beer. There are safes in the room as well. Our room was well taken care of. Fresh flowers were intertwined with our towels that were lovely. The entertainment was mostly family style. A few nights were based on guest involvement and were hillarious. Another night there was a local band and dancers that were very good. On 2 nights I did not care for the entertainment but you could always go the Dominicana/Punta Cana show next door for some variation. There was also a disco that is open till the wee morning. The entertainment staff are a bunch of hard working individuals who work 12 days straight to earn 3 days off and work from 9am - 1am!! Activities start at 10am and end at 5:30pm so the staff can get ready for the nightly shows. The shows run from 9:45- 11:00pm (usually) and before and after is a great band. Staff are there before and after the show working the crowd and dancing with the guest. Some of my family participated in the activities and others did nothing. I really enjoyed the dance lessons that took place at the pool next to the ocean. The staff were a blast and were so much fun with their motivating, friendly personalities and dance music. The beach games and archery were fun as well. Three of us had a massage on the beach. It was the nicest setting I have ever had a massage in. There are 4 thatched roof canopies with massage tables and you can have a side by side massage. The spa is small but does 's at the spa but they can get crowded so they recommend that you prebook at time to use them if possible. There is a hair salon and shopping as well on premises. Four of us in our group went to downtown Punta Cana to shop and were disappointed with the way they were harassed to make purchases. We were content at the hotel shopping. The beach is beautiful. You can walk safely in either direction for miles without shoes. There are areas of seaweed but this is the ocean you know and sea weed is a part of the territory. On the beach there are opportunities for diving, snorkeling, parasailing, banana boat rides, glass bottom boats, etc right on the property. There are also many excursions available. Two of us went golfing one day to the Punta Cana Resort and Club. This is a relatively new Pete Dye course and it is great - 8 holes on the ocean. It was well worth the trip. For $120 you can play, have a cart and they arrange round trip transportation for you. Club rentals were $25. I was highly impressed with the management staff who were everywhere, even asking guests what they thought of their stay, recommendations for improvements, etc. Wednesday is evaluation night for the entire resort and is taken very seriously - extra decorations, the works, and every guest is asked to complete and evaluation on every aspect of their stay. Check in and check out was a breeze. Overall, we had a wonderful time. I heard many other mixed reviews from people staying at surrounding hotels. Most all of the employees at the Iberostar in Punta Cana had a basic knowledge of English. I was told that they were beginning another round of English courses for all staff since they are having some weeks with 80% Americans as guests. Remember, Punta Cana has primarily been a place the Europeans vacation and more recently the Americans are catching on. Be aware that there are topless women on this beach but many of the other resort chains have a higher percentage of European guest. I would recommend this resort for some fun would definately return to the Iberostar Bavaro and was glad I spent the extra money to stay at the 5 star. Adios!!

<Content>It was the best!! My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana from Jan. 11-18, 2003. It was great!! The workers at the resort, from the grounds people to the restaurant workers and everyone in between was so friendly and always had a smile for you. Our room was very nice and the hotel property was very well maintained and very beautiful! The beach and pool areas were excellent and the food was absolutely the best!!! We didn't eat buffet style every evening. We tried the Steak House, Japanese and Gourmet Restaurants and they were awesome!! The weather was beautiful! Only rained at night. The Outback Safari Tour was very well done and it was interesting to see the mountains of the Dominican and meet the people that lived there. My husband and I can't wait to go back, hopefully very soon!! I miss it already!! Thanks to Doug at Bluffton Travel and Apple Vacations for setting everything up for us!!

<Content>A hidden gem in Punta Cana My wife and I have been all over the Caribbean. This place ranks up there with the best. We normally do not stay at all-inclusives but fell in love with this one. We took a one week trip Aug. 2002 for our anniversary. I love to swim and she loves to read. We were both satisfied with the offerings that the hotel provided. Here are some tips:1) Try to get a room close to the beach side.2) As soon as possible sign up for a restaurant.3) If you want to eat in a restaurant twice--go about 5 min. to the hour or 25 mins. after the hr. and ask if they have any cancellations. Most of the time they will.****4) Exchange your towels for new ones in the afternoon and keep them in your room overnight so you can have the new ones to put on the beach chairs in the morning BEFORE you go to breakfast. Stake out your chairs the best locations go fast.5) If you have never been to a Caribbean island go on the Outback tour--If you have extensively avoid it at all cost-- you will be disappointed.6) If you have a problem with topless sunbathers--do not stay here.7) If you want to get certified in SCUBA-sign up the first day (cost $200?). I did it--it was a blast.***8) Check out the clubs at the other hotels in the area. All you have to show is your wrist band. The club at RIU (next door) is great. 9) Learn the dances done in the afternoon at the pool. They do all of them again at night at the club.10) Learn the names of the waiters and waitresses and give a couple of them a tip at the end of your stay. 11) Get up early one morning to catch the sun rise.12) EAT THE ICE CREAM BY THE POOL--BEST IN THE WORLD (ESPECIALLY THE VANILLA).13) Walk 3 miles to the right of the property along the beach facing the water--you won't regret it.14) Take a nap before you go to the club. YOu will need it.15) Get a glass of top shelf liquor from the casino and take it to the club. The club does not have top shelf liquor. Drink the club stuff and you will get a headache in the morning.16) Play the roulette--$5 min. avoid the slots they really just take your money.17) Buy T-shirts in the hotel gift shop-avoid the shops on the end of the beach.18) Enjoy the nightly singing shows or get some sleep for the night club (Your choice).19) Remember to have fun!!!!!!

<Content>Weather was magnificent!!! The hotel and its surrounding areas were gorgeous, with lots of very green foliage and pretty flowers. The food was good, with alot to pick from espically at the buffet. The canteloupe was the absolute best!!!The beach was ample size for the amount of people that stayed during our week Jan 5-12, 2003. Plenty of chairs and room. Very clean there, had room linens changed every day and clean beach towels and chair cushions every day also. The english could have been a little better. All in all it was a wonderful time, would definately go again....
