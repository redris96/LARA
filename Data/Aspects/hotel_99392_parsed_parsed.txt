<Content>Hotel Metro didnt disappoint! My Boyfriend and I were treated to a getaway for our Christmas as an early present and stayed from 16/12 - 22/12We had originally booked hotel Pennsylvania but thanks to reviews on tripadvisor we rebooked as it seemed a nightmare!On arrival we were booked in promptly by Eva, (who is a bit abrupt it has to be said - she wasnt patient when explaining the credit card approval needed for check in, which i thought was a bit rude) i cheekily asked for an upgrade as lots of reviews said this happened often, i was told we already had one with a queen bed, im not sure if this is the case but the room was lovely anyway.the room was warm, fairly spacious, and clean with a huge cupboard which enabled all our shopping to be stowed away in, plus 2 large suitcases, this was a lot of stuff!!The bathroom was fine, clean with loads of toiletries, and the shower was good, water pressure a bit too much for me but my bf loved it. Hairdryer and iron/ironing board were already in the room, as was a safe in the massive cupboard.Fresh towels provided everyday - and the room was cleaned regularly,. On 2 occaisons we had a problem with the room phone, but an engineer was sent up to repair it on both times and then it was fine. Dont use the phone to call international, buy a phonecard where you can call internationally and the minutes you use are deducted from the calling card, not billed to your room, which i was told, is an extortionate rate, if you use the card you are only charged 1 dollar per connected call, regardless of the length.The rooftop terrace has fabulous views of ESB and is worth a look, the coffee room always had fresh tea and coffee on tap, we didnt have breakfast in the hotel, we went to PAX just round the corner, there food is amazing, definately have a tossed salad from the bar!I do not reccomment visiting the Korean restaurant next door to the hotel!My bf and i visited this for takeout after a night out, clearly they though they could take advantage of us because we had a drink. We ordered soup and plain boiled rice, and the charged us 22 dollars!! when i looked in the bag in the room, they had added extra dishes we didnt want, and obviously the most expensive soup and rice that we didnt want!!I was really angry and took the order back, as soon as the guy saw me he tried to play dumb and said the extra dishes were complimentry before i even said a thing!! Admission of guilt straight away! I then argued that if this was the case then they charged 22 dollars for rice and soup and it was really not acceptable and demanded my cash back, whcih he gave me.Avoid like the plague - there food isnt even that nice!!All in all its a lovely hotel and the majority of staff are pleasant and helpfull, clean and confortable which is whats required after a hard day in NYC. its situated in a great spot, just a few blocks form ESB, times square and macys.i would reccommend this hotel and hopefully will return to stay here again.

<Content>Great Location, helpful and friendly staff, coffee on tap! Just spent six nights at the Hotel Metro, across the New Year period. This was my fifth time in New York and I can honestly say the Metro is the best hotel i've stayed in there so far. We booked a Deluxe non-smoking king room and whilst we didn't get the view of the Empire State building, the room was large by New York standards and the bed as comfortable as ours at home. The hotel is located just a couple of blocks from Macy's, central to everything. We found the hotel staff to be superb, they could not have been more helpful or friendly. Quite unusually for New York the rate included breakfast, basic but more than adequate and the big plus was that coffee/tea were available all day and night in the dining room/lounge just off the lobby, a welcome feature when returning from a day's sightseeing/shopping. The only downside was the unreliability of the lifts, one seemed to be out most days, but this is a small price to pay, for a medium sized(much more personality than a big faceless hotel), clean, centrally located lovely hotel. The other plus was the view of the Empire State from the roof of the hotel (used as a bar in Summer) it was closed due to the freezing conditions, but you could still go up and look at the amazing unobstructed view.

<Content>A great Christmas in NYC I have just returned from a 6 night trip to NYC over Christmas with my husband. We stayed at the Metro and couldn't fault it one bit. The room was great, clean, surprisingly large and on the 12th floor, so great views of the Empire State Building. Breakfast was great and unlimited as was the tea and coffee. NYC was fantastic and we did all the sights and the highlight was definately the Rockafella Centre both during the day and at night. We treated ourselves to lunch at the Maze Restaurant (at the London Hotel, Gordon Ramsey's place) on Christmas Day which was excellent and then saw Jersey Boys in the evening - both highly recommended. Got some bargains in Macys and you must visit the MMs store! A tip on the shopping front would be to get out there by 9.00/9.30 as by lunchtime the shops and streets are packed.O'Lunneys on 45th street is great for food and if you want something quick the Chinese next door to the hotel is well worth a visit.

<Content>Hotel Metro This Hotel was really great. This was a birthday treat for me and I travelled with my mum and when we arrived the reception staff were very good, allocated us our room and even remembered that we had asked for a twin bedded room.The room was a nice size on 11th floor and there was never any waiting around for the lifts to come up. The breakfast was a big plus with this hotel as well. Lovely bagels and every type of bread and You could help yourself to coffee 24/7 as well.The location was also very good. So near to a subway and Macy's was practicaly on the doorstep. Try the chinese restaurant next door - also the Korean restaurant, lovely service with friendly staff. All in all a great time. The only drawback this year was that the exchange rate was not very good.

<Content>Metro highly recommended With my wife and two teenage children I spent five nights at the Metro in one of their family suites a week before Christmas. The rooms are generously sized for central Manhattan, particularly the two-bedded room that the kids had, overlooking 35th St. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom well-supplied with large towels and Gilchrist  Soames toiletries. The free buffet breakfast is limited but perfectly adequate, and the constant free hot drinks were very welcome, particularly when we arrived back after a hard day out. Free WiFi was convenient for researching things to do and for keeping in touch with home.On the downside, the Metro's elevators are small and slow, and one of the pair kept breaking down, leading to long delays at busy times. We also had some problems with the TVs, only getting a few or the many channels we should have had, and the hotel maintenance people were not able to fix this before we left. But we'd not come to NY to watch TV so it was no major issue.The hotel location is excellent, on W35th St between 5th and 6th Avenues. Herald Square subway station is two minutes walk; Macy's is right across 6th Ave (but what a disappointment!) There are lots of shops on 34th St and of course 5th Ave. Times Square is a 10 minute walk, or one stop on the subway. We bought MTA unlimited ride tickets so didn't hestiate to take the subway to get out of the snow and rain! The Empire State Building is a 5 minutes walk away, so we were able to get there early and avoid any queueing to get up to the observation deck, though we found the views from the Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center equally good.There are plenty of eating options close by. More than once we had a pizza or a slice from Guiseppe's on the corner of 35th and 6th - simple and delicious.The staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful. Nowhere in Manhattan is cheap, but I felt we got our money's worth at the Metro and I'd have no qualms about staying there again.

<Content>Proof that there are good deals in New York city I've stayed in New York numerous times over the years and can honestly say that the Metro Hotel really does give you value for money.Plus Points: The rooms were clean, moderately sized, we asked for a bathroom (as opposed to a shower) and were given one. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful - especially on reception and the door. We had a free breakfast in the morning - only toasts and muffins - but it was FREE. We could have tea/coffee whenever we wanted. We weren't bothered by noise - from outside or other guests. It is only 12 floors and I says it has 179 rooms - which is small enough for it to still have a personal touch unlike the gigantic places like the Penn Hotel around the corner.You could walk to Penn Station in about 6 minutes, Macy's in about 2 minutes, Time Square in about 10 minutes and Tiffany's etc in about 20 minutes. There is a subway/tube/underground station less than a minute away and so can be anywhere on the island in no time at all.We got a hotel shuttle back to JFK for $20 each (plus tip) - much cheaper than a taxi $80 (plus tip) and quicker than the Sky Train - to be fair - we would have caught the Sky Train back but there were engineering/track problems near to JFK and didn't want a bus transfer.Negative Points: Not many really - I thought it had free WifI but it didn't, no coffee/tea facilities in the room - but we just brought coffee to the room, the coffee wasn't the nicest in the world, the hanging space isn't the largest in the world and the radiator worked fine but it was a dry heat (fan assisted) which wasn't overly comfortable. These are only very minor points though - and compared with some HOLES like the Penn Hotel this was luxurious and we would definitely go back again.Also, the restaurant attached to the hotel isn't great - if you are tired and it's raining and don't want to go out - the food is passable - but I would really force yourself further afield - even if it's only to cross the road to the Bar  Grill

<Content>Can't beat the Hotel Metro! We booked for a four night stay at the Hotel Metro in November 2008 through Thomson Signature. The hotel had been recommended to us by some friends who had previously stayed there. We had originally booked for a deluxe double but the room we had been allocated, although perfectly roomy and clean, smelled of smoke. George on Reception was our hero and very kindly upgraded us to a Family Suite! One bedroom window had a view of the Empire State Building and the other bedroom window had a view of Macys! What more could we ask for?! The room was spotlessly clean with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Coffee and tea were available 24 hours a day downstairs and the breakfast was fantastic - bagels over here are not a patch on the real thing!Location-wise, you couldn't get much better if you tried. 1 block from the Empire State Building, a block from Macy's, 5th Avenue and all its shops are right on your doorstep. The Reception staff that we had contact with were all extremely helpful, gave advice and suggestions on where to go, what to see and the best/cheapest way of doing it. Again, a big shout out to George!There is a small gym on the top floor of the hotel, next to the roof terrace. I did go with the best intentions but never got round to using it - pounding the streets of New York was exercise enough!All in all, it was a fantastic and we are planning our return trip for next year to the same hotel.

<Content>Great Location/Great Hotel Booked with expedia and flew out on Nov 27th for 4 nights. The hotel is in a excellent location, empire state building just around the corner and at the other end of the road the biggest Macy's. The staff were friendly and helpful the room was small, but apparently that is the same everywhere, the breakfast was great, but it would help putting the toaster in a different place, tea and coffee all day was great. Would stay there again.

<Content>Perfect Location! We stayed at the Metro from 26th Nov for 4 nights, the location is excellent - right between 5th and 6th Avenue and so close to Macy's (which was great for our jet lag 5am mornings - went to macy's black friday sale!!), also the free tea and coffee all day we probably saved a small fortune it was so nice to come back after an afternoon shopping / sightseeing with sore feet to sit in the lounge with a cuppa! The breakfast was lovely too and we used the hotel restaurant on our first night as we were so tired and didn't fancy trying to find somewhere, the food was lovely they have lovely cosy booths for 2..nice to sit and relax in with a glass of wine!Our room was on the 4th floor, very nice and clean...views were out onto brick walls but didn't matter to us as we were hardly in the room. We found the staff helpful and friendly, arranged our transfer back the airport with the air link shuttle whihc was $20ea and luckily there were 6 of us so was only 1 other pick-up - would use this service again.We would love to return to New York, and will definately stay at the Hotel Metro again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! We stayed in the Hotel Metro from 26th November until 30th Novemeber. What a lovely hotel right inthe centre of New York. I had requested an upgrade if possible as it was a special birthday trip for my husband and the hotel not only accommodated my request (without additional charge) but also put in our room complimentary chocolates and water. Staff were extremely helpfyul and friendly. We could not fault this hotel. The complimentary breakfast was very very good and restaurant staff work really hard to ensure everything is refilled. The shower in the room was hot and there was additional heating/air con in the rooms. It is almost next tot he Empire State Building and a really good locattion for sightseeing. Again we could not find fault and would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved this great New York Experience Booked this hotel as was my daughter's first trip to New York. We asked for a room on highest floor and they gave us a room looking out onto Empire state building. You can also take pictures up on their lovely roof garden which is open for visitorsThe hotel was lovely, the staff were so helpful and friendly, with the exception of one lady on reception, obviously not too happy that day. May I commend Matthew the doorman, a lovely helpful man. Lovely clean rooms and lovely comfortable beds. Rooms were a bit on the small side, but there again you only sleep in them (we were out from 7.30 am). The hotel surpised us with breakfast, lovely cheeses, jams pastries, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit salad, and lovely thick bread for toast. Breakfast is on from 6.30 am (I think). This definitely set us up for the day. Hotel is off Herald Square and just a short walk to Macy's Empire State and Time Square.Be careful in your room with the mini-bar (if you lift sometime up) for more than 20 seconds it is charged to the room, so be careful!!!Get the Staten Island Ferry across - it is free and lovely view of statue of Liberty.We are looking to visit NYC again next year and will definitely stay at this wonderful hotel

<Content>Great little hotel A great little hotel really well located for 5th Avenue, Broadway, Central Park  within walking distance (if you've got good walking legs!) of most of the touristy places in the city. If you don't fancy the walk just hop on the metro (seconds away at the end of road) or take a cab. Hotel room was small but had everthing we needed  our room was cleaned very well everyday. Breakfast was an added bonus, other reviewers have explained what was on offer. We thought this was a lot easier  cheaper than going out for breakfast everyday although by day 6 it was getting a bit boring. Be aware that food  drink in NY is very, very expensive, we spend a lot of our social time in London  it even caught up by surprise. Having said that we had a really great time  we would definately go back , most probably in the summer months as November was freezing!

<Content>An okay but expensive hotel let down by lazy front desk staff We stayed for nine nights from 14 November, on arrival there was no one to help with our luggage, so we struggled into the hotel (upstairs) with our bags and were told the hotel had no real views of the Empire State Building, but we had been upgraded from a double to a king size room (room 711), which we did appreciate, the view from this room was a building site, which began work at 8am everyday, however. The bed was large and amazingly comfortable, linen soft and the room was very well serviced on a daily basis. My only gripe about the bed would have to be the use of a quilt instead of blankets, this seems to be a trend in hotels these days, it isn't good and there is obviously no way of adjusting the layers as there is with blankets, the quilt was covered with a nasty nylon cover which we removed on our first night as it was too hot and felt horrid.There was no bath, which I did miss being a bath lover and find it especially useful after a long day on my feet. The fridge was one of those 'if you remove anything for more than 20 seconds you will be charged' mechanisms, and it was not possible to store anything of our own in there, and the mini bar was the same. So don't pick those USD6 MMs up for too long or you'll pay for them. There was an ice bucket in the room and an ice machine on level 12, which we used to store our drinks. The hotel supplied free tea (bags) and filtered coffee and fresh milk, in the breakfast room all day and night, which was very nice. Breakfast itself was carbohydrate city, about five different kinds of bagels, muffins, sugary cereal and bread, with babybel cheese, cream cheese, peanut butter, grape jelly and orange marmalade. 'Juices' from concentrates and some instant oatmeal. I would have appreciated a low fat protein option, or even some boiled eggs, and given it is not a cheap hotel I think not an unreasonable expectation.I had three parcels arrive for me whilst at was at the hotel, on each occasion I was not told of their arrival and had to ask, the third one, when I did ask, I was told had not arrived. After messing about contacting the sender and her telling me it had been signed for by the hotel staff, three days earlier, I went back to the front desk who finally got off their backsides and found it. In ever other decent hotel I've stayed in, any packages have been delivered straight to my room, no questions asked. In addition we paid USD80 to have laundry done, which we also had to collect from the front desk. (are the staff glued to their chairs??)The wifi internet access to the rooms is almost non-existent and drops out every five minutes or so, my partner was attempting to work from our room one day and ended up having to go to the business centre. When he was unable to connect at all at one stage, the front desk staff just gave him the number of their wifi supplier and told him to phone them, and then tried to charge us for the phone call!! (A friend of ours was also staying in the hotel on the 9th floor, he too had trouble with bad wifi connection, so it wasn't just our room or floor). The cordless phone in the room had terrible reception and would drop out for every other word, we didn't use it much but when we did it was truly terrible.Overall, an okay hotel, with a subway nearby and Macy's just one block away, however, the front desk staff are lazy and unhelpful and really let the hotel down. I am not sure if I would stay here again, I suspect there are better hotels in the same price range.

<Content>Superb, want to go back asap Just come back from the Metro, travelled with my Daughter and a friend to celebrate my Daughters 18th birthday. I had already contacted concierge in advance to arrange a few birthday surprises and had absolutely no complaints, everything was organised, the cost was cheaper than I could have found it and the pre arrival service faultless.On arrival we were delighted to have been upgraded. Our room was spotless and roomy, we sneaked a look at some other rooms and again although smaller, would have had no complaints.Bell hops, particularly Matthew were lovely and really funny, nothing was to much trouble. Ann on reception and the other man on the desk (I forgot his name) deserve a mention and credit for a really good job. I do know which receptionist people are mentioning, and yes she isn't the friendliest of characters and could do with a happy pill perhaps, but hey we all have bad days and perhaps she has more than others.The breakfast was lovely and just enough to fire you up for the day. Coffee and tea on tap 24/7 was an additional bonus. The hotel bar was expensive (but to be honest in the current financial climate the whole of New York is). Having read reviews before we left I was unsure just what to expect, it would go one way or the other. I can honestly say the entire stay was faultless, yes there is a little noise but tell me who expects to go to New York and find peace and quiet? Its all part of the experience.Location was perfect, ignore the bus ticket sellers (red  Yellow jackets) go via yellow cab, far cheaper in the long run and quicker. If you are out late at night the bus stops at 6.30 anyway, so you would have to take a cab.Get to the Empire State Building as it opens at 8am and avoid the queues we were up at the top enjoying the views ... and snow at 8.06am!! We had been awake since 5 as the jet lag was kicking in so the early start wasn't a problem.The other thing to be aware of and something that did unnerve us was that we were 'given' promotional cd's outside Virgin megastore. They were signed by 'friendly' enough guys who, we assumed were promoting their music and were legitimate given where they were standing!. They then made it clear that they wanted money and were not going to take no for an answer, surrounding us at one point and it was quite scary. We did get away without paying, but please, if approached ignore and do not accept anything they try to give youBack to the hotel, would recommend to anyone, I have stayed in hotels all over the place some basic, some 5 star this was BY FAR the best ever and hope to get back there as soon as my credit card and the exchange rate have recovered!!.

<Content>basic, clean but with cockroaches! We were recomended this hotel from our travel agent as the lady who booked it for us had stayed there previously. it is in a great position very near to fifth avenue and just around the corner from Macy's. However, there are no tea/coffee facilities in your room, you have to go down to the breakfast room for refreshments. Our room had not one but 2 cockroaches, caught by the bell boy but with no apology given. The bell boys were very helpful and friendly but the receptionist were totally different, disinterested when asking where would be good to eat and generally unhelpful and glum. Shame because the hotel has a warm atmosphere. Rooms are basic but clean (minus cockroaches)

<Content>Very Average for the price! I know this is New York and that what you get for your money isn't the same value as you pay and receive in other parts of the country, but this would not be my first choice ever again! Yes, it's conveniently located, right in between 5th and 6th Avenue, and yes, the rooms aren't too badly sized for New York. But, why wouldn't I stay there again? Firstly, there's no room service - well, there is, but the menu is limited and you can't charge it to your room! When I questioned this, I got a very terse response from the person on the phone, suggesting that I was strange to expect that kind of service! There weren't coffee making facilities in the room and we couldn't even get any brought up in the morning- not that this is a huge deal, but it's appreciated when you can do this. Secondly, the breakfast was ok, and included in the price, which is great -but it's all on plastic, disposable plates and cutlery - easy on the clean-up for them but not so great given environmental concerns. Thirdly, when we arrived into our room the carpet was more than damp and smelt very strongly of cleaning product. Great that the floor had been cleaned but it was horrible walking around on the carpet!! Finally, the beds were so incredibly hard that I left feeling like my body had been beaten to a pulp - and I had just 2 nights there! Hate to think what would have happened if I'd been there longer! On the good side though, the doorman we had was great - friendly, which is odd for NYC, and happily stored our bags for us and then made sure our taxi was there to take us to the airport when we needed it to. He didn't openly ask for a tip, as I have had other hotel staff do in the past, but we were happy to offer him one just for being so friendly and helpful! So, for the price we paid, no I wouldn't recommend it -you'd be better off at the Courtyard by Marriot!

<Content>met our needs very well. shared a room with 2 friends, 2 double beds, the size of the room was adequate, prob large by NY standards. the room was clean, beds comfy. wish there had been a coffee maker in the room. bathroom was small but again, adequate. good shower. reasonable rates...it was hard to find a dble room in NY that was in our budget and met our needs, we were pleased with the choice. We did not visit the metro grill or take advantage of the complimentary breakfast.

<Content>Excellent accomodation This was my 2nd stay at the Metro. A superb visit for my husbands 50th. Excellent on all counts, location, cleanliness, staff and rooms. The staff were always giving their valuable advice and when available discount tickets to attractions. I was recommended the Metro 1 year ago and only stayed briefly but couldnt wait to return. FANTASTIC.

<Content>fantastic absolutely fantastic, the breakfast was great- only typical bagals and so on however, walking around NY on a heavy stomach isn't ideal. with a central location within reach of most attractions in minutes the Hotel Metro is outstanding. the rooms are spacious complete with TV facilities and shower. the staff are friendly and efficiant. i would most definately stay here again, do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Hotel is in a great location, 2 minutes from Macys and the Empire State Building, and a ten minute walk to Times Square. the hotel is in a great location and it is easy to reach everything. The subway station is at the end of the street.Rooms at the front have an amazing view of the Empire State Building, although there is some traffic noise.The breakfast is great, with plenty of choice and its always fresh.Rooms are very clean and comfortable, with daily maid service.Staff are friendly and helpful. Would recommend this hotel, the price is very reasonable for what you get. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>nice hotel We stayed at the hotel Metro in New york city in August, and thought it was an excellent choice, The location is great as your between Macy's and the Empire state! The hotel itself was very clean and the decor was nicely done. The breakfast room was great with lots of seating and plenty to eat and drink from cereal, bagels , muffins, toast fresh fruit etc. The hotel has a lovely roof garden with an excellent view of the empire state building. The hotel has a restaurant which we tried one night it was ok but directly across the street there is Brendans bar  grill this was excellent value and great food. New York itself is amazing the highlights for me were the empire state building as the views are breathtaking, grand central station , central park and the hudson river cruise, oh and walking across the brooklyn bridge. You can get around really easily and cheaply on the subway, you buy a metrocard for 7dollars and 50 cents this will take you anywhere all day. The people are really friendly and it is very safe.

<Content>Fantastic location We stayed here for 3 nights from 30 September. We booked through BA who had a more favourable rate than other websites or the hotel direct.The hotel has a fantastic location, only 2 mins walk from a subway station and Macy's, and has views of the Empire State Building. The central location does mean that the rooms suffer from street noise due to a lack of double glazing, but you get used to it.The complimentary breakfast is a real bonus, and there is a plentiful selection of rolls, muffins, bagels, fruit, yoghurt etc. However, the breakfast area is not big enough to accommodate everyone at busy times, and it turns into a bit of a free for all!Staff were friendly and helpful, and we were able to check in early on arrival. The concierge was very helpful with looking after our bags on our last day, and arranging a taxi for us.The room was comfortable and very clean, and the hotel offers free wi-fi access which we found very useful.Overall a very enjoyable stay. This was our 4th visit to NY, and the Metro offered excellent value for money compared with other hotels we have stayed at. We we would definitely stay here again if we return.

<Content>Great Stay After reviewing this hotel on trip advisor my sister and I made a choice to stay here for our 5 day NY trip and were very pleased with our decision. The service was great, very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was just enough to get us going, including some fruit for later. A nice cup of tea at the end of our busy day allowed for some wind down time. The location is great, close to Macy's, Empire state building, Madison Square Garden, 5th Ave, Rockafeller Center and Time Square for walking. Area is clean and subway is 2 min away.We were given an upgrade to a suite upon check-in, big clean rooms and nice bathroom. Yes there is some road noise but not to bad, bring ear plugs if you are sensitive to it. We were on the 12th floor facing 35th st but inside corner so maybe less noisy there.Cab to and from La Gaurdia about 35.00 dollars or 30 min...We would recommend this hotel and would stay here again. I loved New York and can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great location and great breakfast My wife booked us a 5 night stay for my 30th birthday and before we went we requested a room with a view of the Empire State Building which they sorted out for us at no extra charge.Room were a decent size with a good sized bed, free to use safe and a shower room, the rooms were cleaned daily.Breakfast was included in the room rate and was a continental buffet which was a great way to start the day.The location of this hotel was fantastic and really we could of got a better location, turn right out the front door and walk about 200 yds (if that ) and you are at Herald Square, cross the road and you are at Macy's so you are right in Midtown, Empire State building is a block away and Maddison Square Gardens not much more, about 5-10 min walk to Time Square basically the hotel is very, very central.There were restaurants right next door to the hotel and also across the road, the Korean restaurant was very cheap and the portions huge. There was also a great Irish bar nearby and if it's your birthday you drink for free :o)We bought the New York passes and also a Circle Line bus pass before we went which we found great value for money also I would recommend a trip to Woodbury Common for some great value shopping.All in all great location, great hotel excellent staff, excellent service fantastic holiday.

<Content>Very nice hotel! Great location/Nice room! This was our first weekend visit to NYC and this hotel was part of a weekend package/airfare. Good choice! Great location, reasonably priced (for New York, not Chicago) and good service. Hotel is clean and lobby has a very nice art deco vibe. Check in time was 4 p.m., but we arrived at 11:30 a.m. to presumably only check our bags in before running off to Brooklyn. Nice surprise that we were able to check into our room right away! Even better was that our one room was upgraded to a two bedroom suite albeit a smoking suite; but that's okay, because i smoke. Service by all employees, esp. the daytime manager(?) and the doorman (George?) were great! Didn't take advantage of the rooftop bar/view, but will next time I return to NYC. Rooms were clean and comfy and I liked the IPOD radio/chargers they had...served well as alarm clocks. Definitely check this hotel out. Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza are within walking distance: 1 to 3 miles, but it's a nice walk and only 20 minutes tops. Great value for the money!

<Content>Amazing Manhattan Hotel We took a 3 week trip to the States: 2 cities (New York and Chicago) and then a road trip along part of Route 66, up the Mississippi and back to Chicago. We booked every bit of our accommodation solely based on Tripadvisor reviews and everything was just perfect.Hotel Metro was the perfect Manhattan stay. Incredible location 鈥?literally right under the Empire State 鈥?we could gaze straight up at it from our window and an even more spectacular view at night from the hotel鈥檚 terrace bar on the roof. The hotel has been recently refurbished throughout and was spotlessly clean. Our room, a family suite was brilliant and such good value. We were a family of 4 but all adults and yet the room was spacious enough to not get in each other鈥檚 way. The double room had it鈥檚 own door and we shared a lovely modern shower room. They had thoughtfully put an extra sink outside, which was good for 4 people. The housekeeping was amazing, we lacked for nothing, extra pillows already there (and the pillows were top quality comfort), plenty of deep pile luxurious towels, lovely quality shampoo etc. The beds were SO comfy, the air conditioning spot on and everything absolutely spotless 鈥?and we are fussy!! In addition to this, all the staff were so helpful and friendly. We could have free internet access in the office 鈥?which was really useful. The breakfasts were free each morning and very fresh and tasty 鈥?fruits, yoghurts, bagels, pastries, breads, etc. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location and great views from the outdoor bar. Great location for a hotel in New York, right next to the Empire State building so you can sit on the 10 floor outdoor bar and gaze up, up and up at it. Complimentary breakfast was great too with toast, muffins, bagels, yogurts and more but room served in a little small. We stayed here for our honeymoon for 3 nights in Aug 08, you can hear all the noise at weekends as windows not too thick and room d茅cor looked dated. But it was clean and staff lovely. Even got free internet access, which made tickets for the attractions easier with less queuing. The only real downside was the lack of a honeymoon 鈥榳elcome鈥?- we didn鈥檛 even get some chocolates on our pillow! My dad had secretly contacted them to say we were on honeymoon yet despite them reassuring him we would be looked after we were not made to feel special in anyway.

<Content>Absolutely great hotel We booked through BA, didn't pay the earth  were delighted with our stay. The doormen  check-in staff were helpful throughout our stay. Our early arrival was dealt with smoothly, they stored our baggage and made us comfortable until the room was available and our late departure was handled in the same manner. We were even lent an umbrella when the weather became showery for the last couple of days.The room  bathroom were comfortable and very clean with good quality toiletries provided. The public areas were kept really well too. The continental breakfast was excellent  plentiful, and free coffee was available all day long. I can't imagine a more central location, ideal for Broadway  the Empire State. Subway station on the corner and Macys at the end of the block. (Brendans restaurant opposite was 1st class.)I will not need to look anywhere else for my next trip.

<Content>stay here just for the view on roof terrace Hotel Metro - New York - 45 West 35th StreetJust got back to England after a weekend break staying at the Hotel Metro with my 19yr old son, this hotel is fantastic. if it's in your price budget DO NOT hesitate.Compared to similar priced Hotels i think this is the one to stay at. Only 12 floors, which by New York standards, makes it quiet and never any queues at reception or for breakfast etc.I cannot think of a better location, next street to Empire State Building, Macy's next block, Lovely clean Hotel, DON'T believe any bad reviews here, i justthink some people would complain at anything they probably blame the hotel if it rains!! Also it is exactly how it looks in the gallery pictures as it's recently been renovated. All Staff were fantastic, rooms lovely, we booked a Queen room, but got upgraded to a Suite (room1102) free of charge.Highlight is the roof bar/terrace, just awesome view of the ESB,watching people's faces when they first look up on arrival to the terrace for the first time is priceless.Continental breakfast was a great start to the day (i understand most hotels don't provide it free within the price) and as much coffee as you can drink all day  night. Because of the jet lag, i woke up at 3am, decided to go down to breakfast room, grab a coffee and back up onto roof terrace. just to sit and take it all in.PS. Tip for any visitor to New York, visit 'Top of the Rock' at the Rockerfeller centre, the view over Manhattan and Central Park is breathtaking, and the bonus over the Empire State Building, is that you get to see it in the view.Mike  Greg WeatherheadAlcester, England

<Content>great hotel, poor bar staff stayed there in August 2008 and fantastic rooms, and location. went with 6 other people including 3 kids 11, 12 and 14 good points are cleanliness and attentive staff. bad points no fridge in room (except one that is full of way overpiriced items which we were charged for and didnt receive, )no ice on floors need to travel to the 12 floor where the bar is. went up to the bar one evening beautiful views of empire state. bad taste in mouth though from the bar staff. one lady in particular, ignorant and shouldnt have a job. she took exception to me ordering alcholol as i had my children as she stated she wanted to make sure i wasnt giving alcohol to my kids!! complained to management nothing done. i will though def go back to be honest. they were pulling down an old building and my brother in law had to out up with jack hammers at 7 .30 am in the morning for the week. the hotel never told us that so that was a pain. the breakfast is grand. high on bread rolls etc but saves going out to macdonalds etc.. overall i would have rated it 8/10 but dropped because of hotel excavation outside and the bar staff this is a 7 still not bad as we go to nyc every year since 2003 and we have seen some bad hotels.....trip back to Ireland on delta airlines was a mistake we ill always fly aer lingus from now on!!!!!

<Content>Great find Have just arrived back from a week at the Hotel Metro, New York. Having read some negative reviews on this site before we booked we were delighted we had ignored them. From the minute we arrived at Reception the staff were unfailingly welcoming and helpful. The room was an adequate size bearing in mind this was New York and the bathroom had recently been updated with a super large shower cubicle. Good quality toiletries were very welcome as we had travelled hand luggage only. Our window looked out at the Empire State Building which was illuminated at night. Breakfast of fresh fruit, yoghourt, cheese, muffins and various pastries plus toast set us up for the day and hot drinks available all day were a lovely bonus when we arrived back from a hard day sightseeing. We used to take it to our room and collapse on the bed. Free wireless access and two computers were a bonus. Great roof garden was lovely but the food was spoiled by having to be brought up from the restaurant on the ground floor on cold plates so food cold and all drinks including wine served in plastic glasses. The situation couldn't be better right in the middle of Manhattan with a subway station 50 yards away. Pizza place on the corner was great for a snack but was not impressed with Brendons across the road. Bryant Park on 42nd Street is a great place for a rest if in the neighbourhood. Tables, chairs, free newspapers,books and games of chess. With hand luggage it is easy to get to the hotel by air train/subway. We got there quicker than some other people who had taken a taxi.

<Content>Great location for seeing New York We stayed here for two nights and would definately stay again if we were to travel to New York. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean (although avoid the one's at the front of the street as it can be noisy at night!). For sightseeing - it is a few blocks away from Times Square and Broadway, one block away from Macy's and a short walk to the Rockafella Centre. The rooftop bar has a great view of the Empire State Building.The continental breakfast was basic but there is sufficient choice to keep you going for a few hours doing the tourist bit!

<Content>Great Hotel First family holiday in New York and had a great stay at this hotel. We found all the staff we spoke to polite and friendly. The rooms were not the largest but we went to New York to see the sights not the inside of the hotel all day. The breakfast was a bonus and a good start to our day. The hotel was in a good location, near to the subway, Times Square, the ESB and Macys. We enjoyed dinner at the restaurant attached to the hotel and the place across from the hotel. Would stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Metro New York We stayed at this hotel for three nights, and found it to be very good. The room was small but ha this is New York unless you are going to pay mega bucks for a larger hotel. The room was very clean with a good daily maid service, the bed was good and gave a good nights sleep,bathroom was tiny but the shower was nice and hot first thing in the morning and remained hot all day. The hotel staff were helpful, and was ready to offer advise on places to visit. The breafast was excellent a great way to start your day in New York, on the night the roof top terrace was a great place to go and see New York by night.I would recommend this hotel and stay there again.A good place to visit is the Rockafellow centre TOP OF THE ROCK by night you can see most of New York and also the E.S.Building.

<Content>Superb location This hotel was recommended to me by a friend, and we got a good deal by paying in advance on ba.com.The hotel's website makes it out to be posher than it actually is, but in terms of location it's superb - virtually opposite Macy's (I was there for shopping after all), very near Empire State Building and a very short walk from Times Square/5th avenue. We hardly took the subway at all. We got a deluxe room which was old fashioned but very spacious - only slight niggle was that the air con was noisy but this is typical of older hotels. Staff were not terribly friendly, and I was disappointed not to be able to get into my room until 5pm on the first day, despite my voucher stating clearly that check in was from 3pm.Breakfast is interesting, nice continental offering but served on the kind of plastic plate you would expect at a children's party. However most hotels in new york don't offer breakfast at all! Nice touch is that tea and coffee is available all day in the lounge. On the top floor there was a lovely open air bar, very pleasant on a warm evening. Not the best hotel I've ever stayed in by a long way, but great location if you can get a good deal.

<Content>Staff very unhelpful.. Nice room, shame about the building work going on right outside the bedroom window! Virgin Holidays failed to notify us of this even though they knew about it! Out of the room for a large part of the day but even so, 6 drills going under your window at 7am in the morning is NOT acceptable. Toilet overflowed the first time we used it and had to unblock it ourselves (yuk). We found the hotel staff to be unhelpful to the point of being downright rude. Twice we asked them for the usual tourist info i.e.. what time does the Empire State Building open and were given the wrong times (even though the hotel is on the next block to the ESB!!) which resulted in there being a huge queue when we got there. We were also stopped from going onto the roof terrace on 2 occasions as there were private prties going on there. As the advertise this as being part of the attraction of the hotel we though this was out of order.However, one doorman in particular was fantastic and went out of his way to help us. Wish all the staff were like him!

<Content>Great Hotel We just returned from a week stay at the Hotel Metro. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and the staff were very friendly and accomodating to help you get around the city. We booked through an internet sight and our room was about $170 plus taxes. The location is perfect, half a block from one of the main subway terminals, 10 minute walk to Times Square and Broadway Shows. The continental breakfast is a bit busy but has everything you need for a good start on the day. The rooms are a bit small but for what we paid I would gladly stay there again.

<Content>Please read if you plan on staying here When we arrived at Hotel Metro, we were pleasantly surprised with the 1950's decor, and the smell of cleaning supplies. We booked a double bed suite which was beautiful and spacious. There was a large bay window that looked out onto the street below. Everything was great, until the next morning when I awoke to two bed bugs in my bed, and a fresh wound on my leg. I took the comforter off my bed and the other one, and found one more bug in the other bed. I went down to the concierge and alerted them of this issue, and they nonchalantly said that they would switch us to a different room. I was a little shocked by this behavior, since no sympathy was shown, and no manager came out to offer their apologies. I packed everything up, and brought it downstairs (they said the new room wouldn't be ready until 3pm). When I returned later in the day, I asked the concierge if they would be able to dry our clothes - since there were bed bugs, I didn't want to risk moving them from room to room and possibly being bitten again. I was told that they don't do that. Again, I was shocked at the lack of customer service. I asked someone else, and they gave me a name of a cleaner 4 blocks away - I was told to bring the receipt back for the manager to review for a refund. So I dragged two suitcases full of clothes 4 blocks, just to find out that the cleaners don't just dry clothes that they are a full service cleaner with a two-day turn around time - even though we told them the hotel had sent us. So I hauled the clothes back to the hotel and told the concierge what happened (I had asked to speak to a manager, but was told that he had gone home).Then someone else stepped in and said that house-keeping would do it. Now why couldn't this have been done in the first place??When we arrived at our new room, we were sorely disappointed. The room was significantly smaller than the first one we had(although, later, the manager assured us that it was the exact same type of room). The blinds looked like someone had torn them down, crushed them, and hung them back up and the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling and was held on in one corner with several pushpins. We decided to just deal with the room conditions, since we didn't want to have to move again. Our laundry was dried and delivered to our room.The next morning, I went down and asked to speak with the manager. I told him everything that had happened, and he simply answered with I am aware of the situation, but then proceeded to tell me that the bugs that were found in the bed were not bed bugs. It wasn't until after several times of me saying how disappointed I was in the level of customer service, that he finally offered his apologies. He said he would speak with his general manager to see what he could do. Later, he left a message informing me that one night of our stay would be removed from the bill.This was a very generous offer, and I am thankful, but I am still appalled at the way the whole situation was handled, it was like pulling teeth just to get someone to say they were sorry for our inconvenience.

<Content>Good Location and a little different Cheapest place by far to book this hotel is through the BA Website.This hotel is in a great location and only one block from the Empire State Building and two minutes from Maceys. We have just spent three nights there and found the Art Deco styling a pleasant change from the normal US hotel rooms. The continental breakfast is good with a choice of cereal, muffins, begels, toast, yogurt and fruit. Free tea and coffee are served all day which was a nice touch (although it meant no in-room facilities).The staff were efficient and polite although not over friendly apart from the doorman Mathew who was always smiling and very helpful. If you like Chineses food the restaraunt a couple of doors along is reasonable and frequented predominently by oriental patrons (it's the one that does display the prices and is nearest to the hotel)New York is always noisy but be aware that there is some construction work going on adjacent to the hotel which will impact on your rest if you want a lie in, we were up by 06:30 and out fairly swiftly so were not affected.Finally, skip the trip to the top of the Empire state building and go to the Rockerfeller building (Top of the Rock) after dark and enjoy a far better view, and you get to see the Empire State Building all lit up.

<Content>Noisy Construction My husband and I stayed at the Metro for 3 nights, 12th to 15th July and were pleased with the position of the hotel, the outdoor roof terrace and the breakfast.However we also checked in late, after midnight, and were given a third floor room at the back that had definately seen better days! (see a previous review) AND the construction work started at 7 a.m. with a pneumatic drill which seemed in the same room with us!!! As we were leaving that day we said nothing but would have had to change rooms if we were staying.My advice - definately stay at the hotel for the position alone but insist on a room at the front and don't check in late at night if you can help it.J  M from Dawlish, Devon.

<Content>Great friendly Hotel We went to New York on 3 day City break in January. We had a great time the Hotel staff were friendly  helpful. The Hotel is very clean  tidy. Continental breakfast provided plus free drinks in the comfortable lounge all day very good for when you come back from a full day shopping / sight seeing. Will be going back again next year.

<Content>Great Hotel, Close to everything We stayed at this hotel for three nights in June and thought this hotel was fantastic. The room was small compared to what we were used from the rest of out trip but had everything we needed. The free breakfast supplied in the morning was fantastic and just what you needed before a long day walking around NY. The free tea and coffee available 24hours a day was also great as this place was the first place which supplied us with fresh milk after 4 weeks in America. This hotel is has a subway entrance just near by which can get you to just about anywhere.Penn Station is within walking distance which is great if you arrive in NY by train (as we did). Macy's is on the corner and the 5th Ave is only a block away for some great shopping. The Empire State Building is just around the corner. We found the staff helpful and polite. We made the mistake of spending our other 3 nights in NY at another hotel to reduce the cost, but wished we hadn鈥檛 as the Metro hotel was fantastic. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a comfortable place to sleep when exploring the Big Apple.

<Content>The Customer is Always Right? I booked this hotel through Travelocity, and never before have I been confronted with people who are so unwilling to please. We checked in late and they gave us a room on the third floor in the back of the building. The room was small, but clean. However we were awoken the next morning at 6:30am by the sounds of construction. And it wasn't a small annoyance, it was LOUD, and after a long day of travel being able to get a good nights sleep is crucial. So we politely told the front desk about this problem, and they were horribly unaccommodating. They denied that there was any problem, by saying their hotel didn't have any construction going on. But I insisted that as one of their guests it affected my stay and I deserved to have a room where I could be comfortable. After speaking to 3 different people, they said they could switch us to a room in the front of the building on a higher floor but that it would be smaller. (I wondered if that was even possible) They told us we absolutely had to be back at the hotel by 1pm to get the room, and so we did, only to have them tell us the room wouldn't be ready until 4pm. And then they denied telling us we had to be back by 1pm. They should have apologized, and not lied! What ever happened to the customer is always right? The people at this hotel are so unaccommodating, and they don't take accountability for anything. Once we got the new room the stay was fine. We could hear some street noises but nothing nearly as disruptive as the construction. The breakfast was nice, toast, yogurts, bagels, etc. The hotel is clean. It's close to the Subway. But the rooms are really small (smallest I've ever stayed in in NY), and it's like hitting your head against a wall dealing with the staff!

<Content>Great, little hotel in a FANTASTIC location My sister and I stayed at The Metro for a 5 day stay in NYC and loved it. It is in an ideal location (5 minute walk to the Empire State Building and 3 minute walk to Macys!), with fantastic views of the Empire State Building and of NYC in general. The hotel has a gorgeous rooftop bar which boasts panoramic views of the city and makes you feel like you're within reaching distance of the ESB.Breakfast was perfect with a selection of hot/cold beverages and a great choice of bagels and muffins etc.The room was spotless and, although a little small, was perfect for all we needed it for. NYC is such a fantastic city with so much to do that you'll hardly need to sleep :)

<Content>Very nice h么tel well located ! We spent 4 nights at the hotel Metro, this was our pre-honeymoon trip.Our room was on the 5th floor, very clean and spacious (2 beds). The bathroom was also very clean and nice.No noise from the neighbours, beds were very good.The staff was very helpful and friendly, we booked some baseball game tickets and they kept them for us before our arrival.The breakfast was very good (mostly sweet: fresh fruits, muffins, etc..) , there is a terrace on the roof top with a bar, and a nice view on the Empire state building.The location is really central: next to the 34th street station (2 subway lines), there are plenty of restaurants just next door, an irish pub, and many many shops just across the street. The only thing would be that the aircon evacuation outside was a bit noisy, but it was really not a problem to sleep with it with windows closed. And we noticed in our second hotel that there was exactly the same kind of aircon noise. Since there are many big buildings, our room was on the back so the view was on the building on the other side. However, in our next hotel (iroquois) the view was the same. I guess that many hotels in New York have the same issue... but when you come to New York, aren't you supposed to spend more time outside than watching through the windowThere is free internet access with your PC, or you can access their computer room. Handy to book and print entrance tickets from there.Anyway, we really enjoyed our time there and would definitely return to hotel metro!

<Content>Great Hotel in good location We spent 4 nights at this great hotel - the staff were very helpful and the breakfasts very nice - cereals,bagels,fruit and muffins. The free tea and coffee all day was also a nice touch and very welcome after a long shopping trip ! We had a 2 bed suite which was huge and the beds so comfy , OK it was a bit noisy at night but then you are in New York ! The location was great just across the road from macys and the subway just outside the Hotel. Once we'd mastered the subway it was a great way to get around and much quicker than by bus or taxi as the roads were always so busy. We would recommend the Rainbow Room restaurant at the Rockerfeller for a special meal the views were stunning and the food fantastic , it was a little pricey but worth it ! The free Staten Island ferry to see the Statue of Liberty was good and the trip up the Empire State at night amazing although the queues were rather long. New York was much cleaner and safer than expected and everyone so helpful. We used the subway at night and had no problems. All in all a great holiday and a great hotel which we will definitely stay at again - go for the 2 bed suite at 706 if there are 4 of you it was well worth it.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Metro for 4 nights in June. The hotel is in a perfect location for exploring the city, near the subway and it's proximity to the Empire State Building is what won it for me. We spent a couple of hours at the end of each day gazing up at the ESB from the rooftop bar whilst supping some Brooklyn lager.The room we had was not huge but we spent very little time in it anyway, it was clean and had everything in it that we needed, the ipod docking station was an added bonus. The breakfast was good and kept us going for several hours. The one downpoint were the reception staff, we asked them a few questions about things and they were not particularly helpful or friendly, one of their answers to our can we book a time on the internet was simply no, anyway we didn't let this ruin what was a fantastic stay in the city that really does never sleep.

<Content>3 Alaskans loved the Hotel Metro! I booked the Hotel Metro for my daughter, her good friend and myselft to stay in while we visited New York for the first time. The experience was all great except for the first night. I had booked a non-smoking family suite but the suite they offered us was smoking... and did it ever smell smokey! We had to refuse it. The front desk told us they'd move us in to a smaller non-smoking room until the next day when people were to check out. We brought all of our things down the next morning before leaving for the day and continued about our business. When we returned tired and hot at the end of our day... our things had not been moved to the non-smoking suite... and the new people at the counter knew nothing about our switch out. In the end.. they were able to get us in and all was well that ended well but the time spent messing with it was a bit of a bummer. We only had a few days! The rest of our time there - no complaints. We really liked the location alot... the breakfast is great... the service was great. I'd go back in a heartbeat... and would ask for the non-smoking family suite again.... but found the regular non-smoking room to be just fine too. Book them. You'll not be sorry.

<Content>great little hotel in the heart of midtown My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel from June 21st through to June 24th for a 4 night break in NY that we booked via Virgin Holidays as part of a package deal.I had pre-requested a room in the quietest part of the hotel as i am such a light sleeper. We were allocated room 701 on the 7th Floor. I am not sure if the room we had was any quieter than the others but at 7.30am each morning we were woken up but what sounded like rubbish trucks collecting rubbish for half hour each day! Also we alwyas heard loud police/ ambulence/ fire truck sirens each night but that was no big deal as they came and went quickly (and in NY i guess thsi is the norm anyway).The staff at the hotel are great. nothing is too much trouble and they are great at giving directions. they all seems to know the local areas well.The breakfast at the hotel is brilliant. bagels/ muffins/ pastries/ cereals/ tea/ coofee/ juice/ fruit and yoghurt was on offer every morning and never ran out no matter what time we went. It's on from 6.30 - 11.00 am in the hotel dining area. there was always a table for us to use however i am sure it would have been a little trickier if there had been a bigger group of us.The room we had was very small but it was so clean and had a lovely powershower and comfy bed so the size of the room didn't make any difference. We had a one bedded double delux room.From the hotel we walked to Port Authority - 15 mins- Central Park - 30 mins - 5th Ave main shops 15mins - Times Square - 10 mins - Herald Square 5 mins. everything taht is a major attraction in midtown is within and easy wlaking distance!All in all i would definately stay at this hotel again and highly reccomend it.

<Content>Nice hotel I stayed at the Hotel metro for 2 nights during June 2008.Some great points about the hotel were that it was well located (Macy's is about 1 min away), the room was a decent size and clean and a nice continental breakfast. Times Sq was about 7 blocks away (10 min walk).Some not so great points are that dont expect a room with a view-ours backed on to some building/construction work going on, and although we were told the room was in a quiter part of the building, the outdoor noise did filter in.Overall a nice stay, and would consider staying here again.

<Content>Perfect location, a Perfect Trip! My Boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Metro for our first visit to New York and having been given good reviews about the hotel, we were expecting it to be good.... and we were not dissappointed! We loved our stay! Our room was beautifully decorated and our bathroom was clean and modern. a decent sized roomtoo, more than enough for us and as most people say -  Who stays in their room in New York City. The breakfast buffet had just enough of a selection to choose from to get you ready for a day of walking through the fantastic city. The roof bar was a huge bonus ... we got some fab photos of the Empire state and reception staff were friendly and helpful at all times. The only thing that I would say would need changing was the loud air conditioning in our room but it didn't ruin our stay. We will definitley go back to this hotel.

<Content>Great room, clean, but some problems We stayed at the Metro for five days. We chose it because of its location and because of the availability of familiy suites which give our adult son his own room in which to thrash about.Both our bedroom and our son's were very large and comfortable and clean. The bathroom was also large and clean. The location (midtown) is excellent and public transportation readily available. The breakfasts were ample, diverse, and well-stocked.However, there were several aspects of the stay which, minor in themselves, showed some significant management problems.We arrived early, around 12 noon, and left our baggage in a locked room while the harried staff doubted our room would be ready before four o'clock which they claimed was check-in time. The website was clear that three o'clock was check-in but they chose to argue with me about it and, worse, when we came back around three they had made no effort to have our room cleaned even though they knew we would be back. Finally around 3:30 we were permitted to take possession of our room where their own printed guide to services spoke of a three o'clock check-in.There are only two elevators available for guests which made for a very tight fit in the morning period. We were on the ninth floor and many who try to get on at 3, 4, or 5 were forced to wait for another.The toilet leaked quite noisily and a call to the front desk did not resolve the problem which we lived with by keeping the doors shut.There is an extra breakfast room down a hallway but no one on their staff bothers to tell you about it and we often had to tell other guests that it was okay to sit there because it was unclear that we could. Certainly it was barren of any other niceties such as flowers on the table that were in the main breakfast room and chairs were stacked on tables like we were unexpected end unwelcome.For some reason my son's bedroom had no door. It seems likely that this was originally designed as a one-bedroom suite but as they now call it a two-bedroom family suite it ought to have had a door.Despite all these problems (which we did not allow to ruin our stay) we were generally pleased with the location, cleanliness, and size but the management needs to attend to these sorts of problems.

<Content>A good place to stay at I booked over hotels.com and stayed there for two nights.Location: Very close to Penn Station (less than 5 minutes walk). Penn Station is easily accessible from JFK airport by train. Equally close to Greenwich Village and to Central Park south (10-15 minutes of walk). Safe area. Room: The room I stayed in was on 3rd floor. The windows faced another building. I could hardly see if it was sunny or not when I looked out the window. It was very dark inside during daytime. The bed was comfortable enough. The bathroom was clean. Front Desk: The front desk was helpful, but they did not seem friendly. I must say they were just doing their job, but not making an effort to make you feel good. They responded to my requests (password for internet, learning how to use the safe, etc.) very quickly.Internet: Free wireless internet. You need to get a password from the front desk.Overall it was a satisfying experience.

<Content>5 Night stay at Metro Booked the hotel through BA website when booking flights, cheapest room rate by far on the internet.Hotel in great location 2 mins from nearest metro station and walkable to most tourist sites although for 7.50 dollars gets you an all day metro pass.Great buffet continental style breakfast, bar on roof excellent with views of empire state building, good bedroom size and very clean. Only critism was asked for late checkout 15.00 not available but was allowed to keep room until 13.00 which is ok but nowhere to shower and change after that.Dont expect a room with a view.We were flying to/from JFK booked shuttle bus on BA site to get from and back to airport take my advice take the metro or a cab back to airport as jouney time back was well over 2 hours because there were several pick ups which seemed to take forever

<Content>Great service and location! Excellent stay at the Metro - ideal location for the first time visitor. Loved the roof top terrace and the view from our window of the Empire State. The photos on the hotel website do it justice.Breakfast ok considering included in price - lots of bagels, muffins, bread, cereal etc.Very hot weather when we were there and we had to have the air con on constantly which was a little noisy - but then so is NYC!Subway within very short distance. Macy's, Times Square, NY Public Library, Chrysler Building, Grand Central Station and obviously Empire State all within easy walking distance.Brendans Restaurant across the road a bit pricey compared to a lot of other places we ate but ok for first night if you're as tired as we were. Also recommend Playwrites Bar a couple of doors down, and the Heartlands Brewery at the Empire State Building if you want to sample some good local beers. If you feel like splashing out go to the Rainbow Grill in the Rockerfeller Centre for a champagne cocktail and relish the lovely evening views.

<Content>Hotel with a VIEW Perfect location to anything that you would like to do in New York City. When we arried the staff was very friendly and provided us with subway and bus maps. We got to our room which wasn't the biggest room in the world, but who stays in there room in New York?? I looked out the window and we had an amazing view of the Empire State Building.The bar was on the roof and you are definitely in the shadow of ESB.There is a subway terminal less than a block from the front doors and you are less than a block away from ESB and Macy's.Can't wait to come back to Hotel Metro, and maybe we will try the Asian Karoke bar out that is next door.

<Content>Amazing stay in Hotel Metro Stayed for 5 nights end of May/beginning of June. The only criticisms I can think of are that one of the lifts was out for one night, and the room was really noisy but street noise easily blocked out by air con fan. The hotel is amazing, lovely big rooms (superior) and even the mini doubles are big for NYC. The roof terrace has amazing views of Manhattan and the breakfasts are fantastic. After a long day sightseeing and a fab dinner it is wonderful to grab a free coffee from the lounge and head up to the roof terrace to see NYC by night. The hotel staff are great too, we called reception twice once where the safe was not working (our fault) and once to ask how to work the fan on the air con, both times the engineering guy was in our room within 5 minutes to help. The rooms are meticulously clean and the shower is great, wonderful water pressure, only thing missing is a bath.

<Content>Location and, um, pillows! Wonderful location (as many have said here) and only about a 20-25 minute haul from LaGuardia.We walked everywhere from here...all the way up 5th Ave over to central Park, down to the Village, Tribeca and Soho and Little Italy.The concierge service is tremendous. We were in town to see the Eagles at MSG and were ticketless for the Saturday show. Instead of paying upwards of a grand for good seast from a scalper, tthe concierge suggested we check out the main ticket booth about an hour prior to the show...we did and landed third-row seats on the floor...Joe Walsh never looked so good!Our room was fine and clean. The bathroom was very nice with a very large shower. They give you a very useful safe in the room.The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows (yup!) were about the best I've slept on.Great staff. Very accomodating. The breakfast set-up goes above and beyond what you'd expect for a continental. I am not quite sure what folks, on here, are complaining about. This was the best continental spread I've ever had. Bagels, cereal, fresh fruit salad, coffee, toast, juice...I highly recommend the Metro. If you are susceptible to noise, ask for an interior room. We were 6th floor on the street-side and it gets a little raucous at times.Dave

<Content>Right up my street... We selected the Metro as it was offered with a really good rate from the BA website when booking flights for this, our third NYC trip + it had some really good reviews on here, and I have to say we would go back to the Metro again based on this visit.The location was great being so close to 34th St Subway, a block away from Macy's  from ESB, and walking distance from Times Square etc.We really liked the rooftop bar, and the breakfast was just what we needed. (I can see how it could become congested for breakfast, but we had no problem finding a seat every morning)The room was fine, nothing special, but clean and well equipped (the iPod dock on the radio/alarm is a nice touch) The double shower was really nice!Our room was 'internal' so no view and rather dark, but nice and quiet. The rooms looking out onto 35th St looked much more bright and airy.The steak meal we had in the Metro Diner was excellent! The food we had across the road in Brendan's Bar and Grill was not!!Overall, we had a great stay in the Metro and I would recommend it to my friends/family.

<Content>Great location, excellent base to explore NYC! The hotel is perfectly located and walkable to Times Square, MSG, the bus-tour departures, 5th Avenue and the Empire State Building. Its also on the direct subway line to Yankee Stadium! Despite all this its very quiet unlike most hotels in the area.The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms have great showers. The maid service is excellent..The roof top bar is a great place to start a night out, it overlooks the empire state building and is a very chilled out place, the only criticism of the hotel is that the breakfast was a little thin on choice (only bagels, muffins, yoghurts and cereals) but we werent complaining as it was included in the price.I would definately consider going back.

<Content>OK stay at the Hotel Metro We stayed at the Hotel Metro for 5 nights. The hotel was very clean and enjoyed the continental breakfasts. We had a large room facing the front of the hotel and we could see the ESB out of the window. We just had a shower - no bath but that was o.k. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard but the one problem we had with being on the front of the hotel was the noise. Luckily I took some ear plugs so was o.k. The Hotel was in easy walking distance to Times Square, the Flat Iron Building, Macys, Madison Square Gardens, Central Station and it was not too far to Central Park (we did it in about 25 minutes). The reception staff were always helpful but when we arrived we were told booking in was not until 4.00 p.m. so we had to go for a walk about until it was 4.00. I would stay at this hotel again but would ask for a room on the back of the hotel next time or take my ear plugs again!

<Content>Midtown Hotel was lovely and very clean although if you are going for a view, perhaps another hotel would be in a better venue. Location is good for the Empire State Building and there is easy access to the subway (a must, just for the experience!!) and Penn station. Time square is not far, a nice 15minute walk taking you passed Bryant Park. An MP3 docking station was located within the room and although no tea/coffee making facilities within the rooms, there is 24hr facilities in the breakfast room which makes for a pleasent social gathering. Staff on the front desk were nothing but friendly and helpful. Although this is supposed to be a review of the hotel, I can't write a report without suggesting going on the 'world yacht cruise' from Pier 83, it was fantastic and had excellent views of manhatten by night as well as high quality food and service with a smile.

<Content>Great spot in the middle of NYC Just came back from NYC. Went for weekend with a friend (in her 50's) and my boyfriend (both in our early 30's). It was our 5th time in the Big Apple. Drove there and parked the car at a Parking lot in the same block of the Hotel Metro. We stayed for 2 nights in the hotel family suite. Great staff, friendly. Room is a double room with one shared bathroom. One room is smaller with a door for more privacy, nice queen size bed and tv, 2 windows, small desk. Second room is a very large one with 2 double beds, tv, with a small table and nice cozy chair in a corner, one window. Everything was very clean. The bathroom is decent size, well equipped but bath is old and not emptying very fast....that is the only thing we did not like. Wireless internet working great. The breakfast is included , very yummy and runs until 11ham wich is great for people who do not like to get up too early. The roof terrace is real nice, with amazing view of the Empire State Building, great place to relax after a long day walking around NYC. Even if you are in the middle of Manhattan, the rooms are fairly quiet(you can hear once in a while a louder street noise but nothing to wake you up from your sleep). The 3 of us would definitely go back, price is worth it (we paid total of 960$ for 2 nights taxes inc. (Saturday and Sunday)Plus 50$ for parking for 48hours.) You could sleep comfortably 4 people or even 3 couples if you don't mind sharing one bathroom and if the hotel rules let you do that...not sure. I am glad we stayed there, it is a great choice for people who do not mind a little less luxury and a little more room. Pictures from hotel website can be trusted.

<Content>awful So unlike most of these reviews my family and i did not have a nice stay at this hotel we only stayed one night,and thank god for that! we called the day before to see if we could have an early check in and they informed us that it would be ok. My daughter was graduating from college in the city at 6pm and we wanted time to get ready. we arrived at 12 and were told that our room would not be ready for another hour, so we did some shopping and came back in a hour then were told our room was still not ready so we proceeded to go get lunch becaseu we were told our room would defenitly be ready with in 15 min. when we returned with in an hour there was a new staff at the front desk that told us our room was still not ready, this women was so rude and arrogant that we just wanted to leave , but after waiting another 30 min we finally were put into our penthouse room where there were two bed that were small. we had five people that were staying over. when we called the front desk to ask for a cot we were informed that our penthouse suit was only for 2 people and that we were going to be charger 25$ extra a person. with that being said we thought that we could get a roll away bed, but no they had none! my daughters boyfriend had to end up sleeping on the ground. if this was not bad enough my daughter found dirty boxers under the bed!!!! i almost died when i saw this i was disgusted and mortified i am not one to complain about hotels and i am an easy going person along with my family but our stay here was just plan awful i would not go back and not recomend this hotel to anyone!!!!!!

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location! We just returned from our stay at the Hotel Metro, and were very pleased! We booked our room through Hotels.com, which usually gets you a smaller room with a double bed. However upon arrival, the friendly staff upgraded our room to the larger queen room in the back of the hotel, without us even asking! They were great at recommending restaurants and activities for our stay, and were overall very nice! The room was a good size, with good amenities within, and great toiletries. The bathroom is definitely on the small side, which made for interesting showers, as there really isn't anywhere to put your shampoo, conditioner, etc while in the shower! It wasn't a big problem though, as the rest of the room was just great. The breakfast is a major plus- it saved us a lot of money throughout our stay! There were yummy bagels, muffins, cinnamon toast, cereal, fruit,  juice. The breakfast goes until 11am, which works out great for those late mornings after a long night exploring! The rooftop deck offers a great view of the Empire State Building, which is a must-see. Another plus is the great location. We stayed here based off everyone's reviews about the great location, and were definitely pleased! There are subways literally steps away, which works out great. Macy's is very close, and the ESB is just around the corner! The pizza place on the corner like the other reviewer mentioned is a great place for a slice of pizza! The Hotel is on 35th st between 5th and 6th avenues, which makes it a little less loud than being, say, in times square, but offers enough traffic so you can easily catch a cab during the day. Overall, the location is definitely a major advantage, with it being close enough to everything you need and easy to navigate from! We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Metro, and as a first-time visitor to New York City, found the staff to be very helpful, and would highly recommend it!

<Content>Excellent Excellent place to stay. The hotel was very clean and comfortable. The rooms were spacious and clean. The front desk staff was very helpful. It was in an excellent location with a subway just down the street and a short walk to any shopping. I would stay here again with no question. The breakfast had everything you needed and places to eat was very close. This would be my hotel of choice anytime. I am a very picky person and this was a no brainer. The rooftop view of the Empire State Building was beautiful.

<Content>Shhh, don't tell anyone how good this is, we'll never get back in!!! Apparently, this hotel used to be a bit tacky and run down. Well, evidently they have undergone some fairly recent renos, because this turned out to be a fantastic little find; a real gem of a hotel. You can鈥檛 beat the location, 35th and 6th, a subway stop right at the end of the street, walking distance to much, a block away from the Empire State Bldg., and only really ever a 10-15 minute cab or subway ride to anywhere else. We loved it!We had a family of 4 in one of their family rooms. We booked online direct with them. My sister had a separate room; she booked through Expedia. The 鈥渄ouble鈥?room she got is not advertised on the Hotel鈥檚 own site; those rooms are just a bit smaller and they reserve those for companies like Expedia to use. The front desk staff and doorman are all great and helpful; evidently there for a while, and when a hotel in NYC can keep its staff loyal like that, it tells me something. All the room cleaning staff were wearing back supports to protect them; that tells me the hotel cares enough to ensure their on the job safety.Our room, 902, was toward the back of the hotel, which is good, because it was very quiet. My sister鈥檚 original room, 203, was a the top of the stairs from the lobby. The first night, she got no sleep due to the noise level; the sound really carries up from the lobby, so if you鈥檙e a light sleeper, pass on that room. There鈥檚 also a place under construction right next door, and they have an overnight shift that is working it that also contributed to the noise factor. However, the next day, the hotel very graciously, and without any fuss, agreed to move my sister. She ended up in 712, a slightly larger accommodation, and it was much better. Note that all the -08 rooms are immediately across from the elevator doors, so light sleepers will hear that traffic all night.The family room is a 3 bed accommodation, one master queen bedroom, the other 2 double beds in an open room. It really does look just like the pictures on the web. Both rooms had TVs, good sized single bathroom and shower, and a separate 2nd sink outside. In room mini bar, but read the rules about that carefully. Nice selection of amenities in the bathroom. The carpets are evidently fairly new. The towels were all close to 鈥渟pa鈥?quality; not one worn towel in the bunch for 5 days. They have a lounge off the lobby which is where you can get all day coffee/tea, and where brekkie is served. We were actually quite surprised by the quality and quantity of the breakfast foods. Fresh bagels and huge muffins, fresh fruit, fruit salad, yogurts, all manner of toasts, including pop tarts (!) and cereal. It tends to get a bit crowded in there around 8:30 but by 9:00, it opens up again. TVs and complimentary newspapers throughout.Next to the location, the best part of the Hotel Metro was the price. We had originally made our reservation at the Affinia Manhattan, because it was often recommended on TA, but they were charging $700+ for their 2 bedroom suite, which includes a kitchenette, but no breakfast, and it was right near the train station. Metro charged $423, including breakfast, and it鈥檚 a 4 minute walk to Macy鈥檚. The room was huge, and all in all we were totally delighted with the place. We'd go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>Spot On The hotel was lovely, the staff would do anything for you to make your stay enjoyable. They advise you on the top places to visit and eat. You could not fault the breakfast, there was fresh fruit, bread,buns, iced buns, cakes, cereal, yogurt, diced fruit, jam,marmalade,cheese,tea,coffee,pure orange juice,pure apple juice,milk,porridge and you could eat as much as you want in the dinning room or take up to your room. The rooms all had hair-dryers, iron + ironing boardsin as well as a safe + minibar,but try not using the mini bar, we went to the corner shop for the beer. The roof top was lovely sitting having a beer looking at the empirestate building.The only thing you need is a american travel plug whic we bought there + was @ 拢12.

<Content>Awesome location! I have to start with location. This is the best hotel i've ever seen with location and i've been in some good ones. Its a literal stonesthrow from Macys and a short walk from most places including the Empire State Building which we had a great view of from our room.The rooftop also gives great views but in December is slightly too cold to hang about in! The rooms are quite small but very comfortable and well kept, plus if you shop around for hotels you'll find most New York hotels have the same thing small rooms because the space is such a premium.Although expensive in most cities the Metro is very reasonable considering its NY and its got a great location.The staff were unobtrusive but helpful when asked.NB: Should you stay here, head out the front door, turn right, cross the road and call into the pizza place on the corner for a slice and a coke. The pizza is fantastic!

<Content>Fantastic This was everything it seemed on both the web and tripadvisor comments.The view of the empire state building was stunning and you can look down and see the hotel from the top of the building too! Easy shopping in macys from there and walkable to Penn station. In fact walkable to most key sites - or quick metro/bus/taxi away.Excellent muffins!Only criticism would be size of bathroom which was small for the quality of room which we had.

<Content>Perfect Central Location We've just arrived back from a great long weekend in Manhatten, staying at the Hotel Metro and wanted to share our experience with others thinking of this Hotel as an option.We selected the Metro because of its apparent central position, and we weren't disappointed. Flying Continental into Newark, we'd picked a direct flight out, returning to Edinburgh via Birmingham so we could steer clear of the mess at Heathrow. Continental looked after us pretty well. The flight took 7 and a half hours, departing and arriving on time. Their choice of in-flight entertainment was very impressive and made the journey more bearable. Arriving at Newark, we took the New Jersey Transit train from Newark into New York Penn Station, only three blocks from the Metro. Two adult and one child on the train cost only $33 each way. Cheaper than a cab, and we were at Penn Station 40 minutes after boarding the train. The Metro sits in a narrow street only a block away from both the Empire State Building (left) and Macy's (right), so its already a good starting point for sightseeing. It isn't a big hotel but we found it very comfortable for our needs. Listen, you don't visit New York City to sit around a hotel room all day ! ! ! Get out there and enjoy the place ! Our party of three had booked into a Double Double room. We expected abit of a squeeze for 4 days. When we arrived we were delighted to find that they'd allocated us something akin to a small suite - one main bedroom with two double beds, one separate room with another double bed, and a shower room. Power shower would be an understatement ! Oh, and my 'other half' complained that the hairdryer lacked any power to actually dry her hair. CRISIS ! There was a well-stocked fridge with plenty of choice although the prices were typical hotel prices, with a curious warning that any item removed for more than 20 seconds would be billed to you... HOW WOULD THEY KNOW??? Was Big Brother watching???Heeding warnings we'd read about street noise, our 3rd floor room proved low enough to benefit from the full flavour of the neighbouring Irish Bars, and the 24hr horn-honking that is the staple diet of US drivers. But it only disturbed us on the first night. Every other night, we were so tired from walking and the fresh air, that we slept like babies. Breakfast was included in our price but to be honest, was our only disappointment. You have to get in and out early to beat the crush. The layout of the continental style servery is poor as it occupies a corner of the dining room. This means that if its busy, you get trapped by the mass waiting behind you. There's no 'flow'. There's also a lack of seating so that on two of our four mornings, I had to stand beside the table as my family ate, failing miserably in my attempt to eat a large bagel gracefully ! !Service is very good. Staff are polite, helpful and attentive without being in your face. For example - When my partner asked ME to ask the lone female on reception where we could find Hooters (she wanted one of their T-Shirts !) the receptionist didn't even bat an eye as she checked the internet details, called them to check their address, then gave me written details to locate them !Incidentally, I didn't taste any of the Hooters fried chicken I ordered - I was too busy ogling the waitress ! !The main bus tour companies operate past the Empire State, so arranging and buying tickets was easy and well worth the cost. We could get on or off anywhere on their route at any time from 9am til 6pm and their tour guides were both informative and amusing. For us, it was all about location though. Times Square is 10 minutes walk away from the Metro. Penn Station is also home to Madison Square Garden - again a 10 minute walk. The Empire State sits on 5th Avenue, renowned for its shopping. And Broadway is at the end of the street so the theatres begin 5 minutes walk away.Would we go back? In a heartbeat. Would we stay at the Metro again? Definitely.Would we take the family again? Absolutely... not ! Next time, we're going by ourselves so that we can enjoy more of the evening entertainment and we won't have to visit MM world again ! ! !One word of warning. Prepare to leave your manners and courtesy behind you. This is a big city. It seemed like everyone was fixated on where they were going, and anything between them and their destination was game for being barged out of the way, without apolgy or even acknowledgment. It won't spoil your enjoyment of this fabulous place though. Enjoy.

<Content>What can you add!!! We stayed at the Metro during the first week of April, taking a vacation and a shopping trip for the better half. Well, there can not be a lot to add to all the previously positive comments, only to say that I agree totally and the hotel is a great find for NY. For what you pay and what you get, with the room, hotel and staff, it is exceptional value and we will definitely stay there again.The hotel is located in a great position between 5th and 6th Avenue and is easy to access from Newark Airport. We caught the train from the airport to NY Penn, which took about 30 minutes and cost $15, then walked for 10 minutes to the hotel from the station. The walk is easy and on the way you pass the shops and Madison Square Gardens, if it鈥檚 a sunny day you also get a great initial view of the ESB! The hotel is five minutes from Macy's one way and five minutes from the shops of 5th Avenue the other. It takes about 10 - 15 minutes to walk to Times Square and subway access is just at the end of the street.While we were there we saw two shows on Broadway and purchased the tickets for $60 a piece from the last minute booth on 46th Street, just behind the Marriot off the Times Square area.I would also recommend the restaurant across the road from the Hotel, Brendan鈥檚, as on the first night we walked for ages looking for a place to eat and ended back here. The atmosphere was good and so was the food and value. There is a great selection of fish and meat and the staff are really helpful. Try it; it is a good place for the first night, until you get your bearings.The Statton Island ferry was good too, and you get great views of DT Manhattan.If you do happen to go to Macey's get your discount card from the visitors centre on the ground floor mezzanine level, you will save 11% on most of your purchases and should provide a slight relief to the credit card!!Enjoy.

<Content>Great Location It was our first trip to New York and we selected the Hotel Metro soley on the Tripadvisor reviews - and I'm glad to say it was exactly as described, i.e. good location, friendly/efficient staff and decent-sized, clean, rooms. The lounge with the free coffee is a nice touch - the only slight niggle we had was that in the morning this area is used for breakfast and it can get crowded and very, very hot. Having said that, we would certainly book in to the Metro on any future visits to New York.

<Content>Hotel Metro a real gem in NY Chose Hotel Metro thanks to reviewers on this website. Couldn't fault it at all. Staff extremely helpful. 2nd floor room at back meant it was really quiet and we could walk upstairs. Free internet access. Excellent huge muffins and bagels/cereals/yoghurt for complimentary breakfast and all day tea and coffee/hot water provided free. Superb location one block from Empire State Building and Macys...short walk to Times Square and Broadway....extremely good value for money (we booked through BA as thats who we flew into NY wih). Highly recommended. I travelled with my teenage son and we had a twin room with 2 big very comfy beds. Metro Grill attached to hotel serves superb steak and fries and cheesecake and you get 10% discount if staying in the hotel. We walked to Central Park and hired bikes for $20 for 2 hours and managed to cycle round the whole thing.

<Content>Great experience overall We stayed in the hotel at the end of February for a week and I have to say it's great! The reason I chose it was because of the reviews I'd read here- so I just wanted to add my compliments.Firstly, the best thing about this hotel is location, location, location. This was our first time in NYC, so we were really booking blind. It's within walking distance to most of the sights, and for those places a bit far away, there's a subway station less than a minute away. Macy's is a stone's throw away, and the Empire State Building is just around the corner- though you can see it from your room if you're feeling lazy!Most of the staff were lovely, and very helpful with booking tours and giving advice and directions.The breakfast is amazing- about 5 different types of bagels, breads, cheeses, fruit, cereal, muffins, juices, tea, coffee- it was really a great set up for the day. AND there's complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby throughout the day- fantastic!The rooms was lovely too, and really quite big for a standard room. And the safe was really big, our laptop fit in with plenty of room for money, jewellery etc. There's an ipod dock, which is great for listening to some tunes when you're recovering from the days trekking! The shower was gorgeous too- really powerful!And there's plenty of shelf room in the bathroom, which is important for when you're trying to pamper or do make-up! I didn't bother bringing my hairdryer because of space, but the one in the hotel was fine- the battery didn't power out once while I was using it, which can be really annoying in hotels.There was a slight problem with the restaurant- myself and my boyfriend ate there about an hour before they were due to close on a Wednesday, and the food looked like it was thrown together. The waiter was very friendly, but it looked, and tasted, like the food was just taken out of the fridge and popped into the microwave. But I think this business is separate to the hotel- just thought I'd mention it.Basically, I would most definitely book this hotel- it's a real gem. I've compared experiences with other people, and it really seems that for the price we paid, we got so many extras

<Content>Great find Having read previous reviews of this hotel decided to book. Given the price was less than most others considered, did not have great expectations. This hotel is a great find in a wonderful location - one block from Macy's, walking distance to the Theatre District, close to the subway for shopping uptown or in Soho. Staff were friendly, rooms of very adequate size, and complimentary breakfast a welcome addition. Would recommend to others and will stay here on our next visit to NYC.

<Content>Staff was really helpful - nice continental breakfast From the moment we arrived the staff seemed happy to see us arrive (verses thinking we are another pain headed their way), treated us as guests and was helpful throughout the entire trip with directions, theater tickets, transportation, etc. This was my youngests son's first trip to the Big Apple and he thought it was great. Thanks for making his first trip so memorable.....we'll be back.The location was also nice and centrally located in Mid-Town.Dan H - Apple Valley MN

<Content>Great Place to Stay All the positives written about Hotel Metro in the previous postings are correct. With friendly helpful staff, great access to the subway, great shopping on your doorstep, tasty pizza at the end of the street, and a comfortable clean room there is little else that you would need!! Our room was facing the street and therefore we experienced a reasonable level of street noise, but that is NYC and we got used to it quickly.Yes the room was small, but it was comfortable and we didn't spend a lot of time in there anyway. The breakfast room with 24hr coffee was great albeit a little crowded in the morning! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back when next in New York. I would recomend this Hotel to anyone

<Content>Good Location, Small Rooms This reminded me of several independent hotels I've stayed at in Europe. Small rooms, small bathrooms, small elevators...not at all like your American mega-chains. Nothing special about the rooms at all, just your basic and in need of major refurbishing. TV's were very old, with two remotes for different control functions. The only thing in the room I liked was the shower. Front desk was very friendly and accomodating. Next door is a small pizza shop, the Metro Grill for standard American fare (great deserts), two Irish pubs and there are a couple Korean/Asian restaurants on the same side of the street. If you are going to shop in the area--be prepared for large crowds and extremely messing/unorganized racks!! You can tell a million people pass through these shops a day. It was hard to find something that wasn't on the right rack or on the floor.

<Content>Not new, but nice We stayed from Wednesday to Sunday. The location of the hotel was excellent (one block from Empire State Building and one block from Macy's). Friendly staff, espescially the bell boy. Free coffe and tea 24 hour's and a complimentary continental breakfast was nice. Breakfast room not the best because it partially was set up with sofa's and coffe tables, but remember there are two rooms for eating breakfast. The second one is much better. Room was clean, but not european standard in size. Safe in room was big enough. I could put my laptop in side it. We used the penthouse terrace for the smoker's in the party, much better than standing on the sidewalk. We did not test the fitness room and did'nt see anybody else there either. Location close to main sight's and bus stop for tourist buses. Wery close to the subway. We liked it and would probably recomend it to friends even though we had wanted a bigger room. The hotel will probably need a brush up of the room's in the near future, but still no problem's with the two rooms we had booked. Try to get a room on the back side and avoid the noice from the street.

<Content>Great Deal for NYC Nice hotel for a reasonable New York City price. Clean rooms, friendly staff, good continental breakfast (muffins, cereals, yogurt, etc.). Rooms are TINY...so be forewarned. A double room is nothing more than a double bed with little extra room at all - we couldn't even open our bathroom door all the way w/o hitting the bed! (Bathroom is very small, as well - no tub, just a shower.) BUT...excellent location, great pizza just a few doors down. Surrounded by Irish pubs  bars, within walking distance of all NYC tourist spots.Definitely check out the view from the rooftop terrace. It makes the stay worthwhile!!

<Content>Once again I loved this Hotel I just got back from a two day stay at the Hotel Metro. I stayed there once before at the end of 2005, and liked it enough to stay again in March 2008.As most of the reviews indicate, the location is great. The Empire State, Macy's, Madison Square Garden and Times Square are a few minute walk away. This time we paid for a double bed and were ugraded to a King Bed with a nice soaking tub at no cost. The bed was really comfortable, and the room included a closet with safe. Breakfast is included, and was good. Rooftop area is nice, and the hotel has a nice fitness area also. Don't let the 2 star rating on this site discourage you, this hotel is a great place to stay at a fairly reasonable price. We travel a lot all over the world, and have stayed at a lot of 4 star hotels, and this hotel meets our needs nicely.

<Content>Love the Metro We stayed at the Metro for five nights in February, having to extend one night because of flight cancellations from weather. The hotel was accomodating to our needs and charged a fair price despite our bind. The room was spotless and comfortable. The desk staff were lovely. Breakfast was abundant though not particularly innovative. The hotel is half a block from the nearest subway and convenient to all public transportation as well as being within walking distance of many tourist attractions.i will stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel, great location Excellent hotel. We've just come back from a stay (11-17 March 2008) and I can only reiterate what other positive reviewers have said. A brilliant location, with the 34th St subway 100 yards away which takes you up or down-town to most of the major places in Manhattan. The hotel is incredibly clean and is decorated in a nice modern/1930s style. Our room was at the back of the hotel so quite dark, but with the darkness you also get quiet, away from the hub-bub of Midtown Manhattan, which was much needed after a hectic day in the city. It was spacious and the bed was huge and very comfortable. No tea/coffee making facilities in room but 24 hour access to hot drinks in the downstairs lounge. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our toilet flooded at one point and a member of the staff came to fix it within minutes. They also provide useful local information. As well as a free breakfast (quite unusual in NYC hotels) there was also free computer access, a gym and an amazing roof terrace which looks out onto the Empire State Building. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there if we go to NYC again. I will be recommending it to all my friends and family!

<Content>A wonderful experience from start to finish. I had originally planned to stay at another( far more expensive) hotel.The travel agent highly recommended this hotel so I went ahead.I was a bit apprehensive I must admit but I was so glad that I had listened to her!!! From start to finish my daughter and I were treated like we were the only residents.Through my work I had stayed in the Ritz Carlton in Miami in January-the front desk in Miami could learn a lot from Anu,Matthew etc etc.We upgraded to a larger room which was well worth every cent.Our every request was dealt with promptly and efficiently including the morning my daughter shut my coat in the safe and I was stuck!!The location was great for shopping and the subway too.I loved the breakfast selection -this also saved us a fair bit of money too I may add.All in all I cannot say one negative thing about our stay here.Roll on March 2010 when God willing we will return to celebrate my daughter's 30th Birthday!!!!

<Content>Great Little Hotel 16th March 2008Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Metro, New York which we booked along with flights through British Airways after much research. Virtually every review of the hotel was favourable, and we would certainly agree with everybody else. Fantastic location, couple of blocks from Empire State, round the corner from 5th Avenue and a Metro stop nearby; couldn't have been better. Room was excellent and clean and as mentioned the rooftop area affords a brilliant view of the Empire State, especially at night. Breakfast was good and set us up nicely for a day's sightseeing; and the staff were helpful when needed. Can recommend the Ruby Tuesday restaurant just off Times Square, good value and good menu. Altogether an excellent stay, and looking forward to going back, and would have no hesitation at staying at the Metro again.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! After much comparison shopping and research, we chose the Metro for our recent long weekend in the Big Apple. We were travelling with our two oldest children, ---who brother and sister or not, are post-puberty and flat refuse to share a bed--- so we needed three beds. Those are not easy to find in NYC! We were thrilled with the Hotel Metro's Family Suite! The kids had a room with two double beds and we had our own room! The staff was great- the manager even sent a bag of souvenirs that we had left on to our home for us! They were happy to arrange transportation, recommend restaurants, and hold our luggage until our flight. The breakfast was filling, the place is immaculately clean, and the location is just about perfect! What more could you possibly ask ?

<Content>Very helpful staff. Room small but adequate, comfortable and clean, quieter at the rear. Great position for shopping  sightseeing. Most pleasant and helpful reception staff - including doorman - that I've found in New York. Breakfast not a gourmet feast but adequate in the price range and plenty of alternatives nearby if more substantial preferred. Would stay there again.

<Content>Great location! My mum and I stayed at Hotel Metro in February this year. We received decent rates on Expedia and we were impressed by the reviews the hotel had received on this website.I had booked a month or so in advance and had requested a non-smoking rooms away from the elevator. Much to my disatisfaction, we were given a smoking room right next to the elevator - not impressed! However, in the hotel's defence, the smoking rooms were very well maintained and the smell of smoke was not too bad, it was just when you entered the floor and caught the smoke from the other rooms. Be sure when requesting a non-smoking rooms that it is for health reasons, this will give you a better chance of getting one.The elevator was a bit annoying, hearing people getting in and out all night and the ding as it arrived at our floor. I think our room was one of the older ones, the heater didn't work and there was no in-room safe as their website stated.On a positive note though, the location was sensational! The rooms were very comfortable and always clean. The breakfast each day was great, coffee on tap 24/7 was also a nice treat as both my mum and I are big coffee drinkers. I liked that the hotel had both elevators and stairs for those who don't like elevators. The bell staff could have been a little more helpful. Upon leaving the bell guy watched as my mum and I struggled with our bags, didn't even open the door for us. I found this a little rude.

<Content>Truly a hidden gem!! Stayed at the Hotel Metro Feb. 24, 25 and 26 and truly enjoyed our experience. Location is excellent, you can walk to almost anywhere. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful . Very nice continental breakfast available daily with enough selections to satisfy almost anyone. The room was nicely appointed and though somewhat small it was very comfortable. Very good value for the money. We would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in New York without taking out a second mortgage.Larry from North Carolina

<Content>Great Stay! My wife and I stayed here for four nights mid February. We choose this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor and I have to say they were very helpful. We found the staff to be great and the rooms larger than we expected (stayed in a king superior) and well maintained. The continental breakfast was well stocked and provided good healthy fuel to start each day of sightseeing. The location is great with Macy's 1 1/2 blocks away, MSG 3 blocks, and Times Square 6 blocks. There is a subway entrance on the same block as the hotel. Our only issue was finding a decent restaurant near the hotel late at night (after a show). Everything seems to close at 11pm. We learned to eat before we headed back at the end of each day. Overall a great stay at a reasonable price. The Hotel Metro will definately be our home for future visits.

<Content>A little gem... I visited the Hotel Metro for 4 nights last weekend and have to say it was wonderful. I usually stay at the hotel over the road - but no more. The hotel is very clean, very relaxing and the staff are not in your face but really nice and helpful if you need them. I stayed in a Superior Queen room and for one person the size was plentiful. The complimentary breakfast has an excellent choice - the muffins are huge! I visit New York every year at this time and the Metro is the place I will be staying from now on, The roof terrace was open during my stay and it was amazing to take a coffee up there and sit for there for a while admiring the Empire State Building, to rest and recuperate ready for the next spot of shopping! Thank you Hotel Metro.

<Content>Couldn't Have Been Happier! We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and found the price to be very reasonable, the room was spacious and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit! The main room had two double beds, a round dining table for 4 and a typical armoire with TV, etc... Nothing fancy, but it was updated, clean and plenty of room to move around. The 2nd bedroom had a king bed, desk and TV stand. It was great to put the kids to bed and be able to retreat to our own space and could watch TV without disturbing them. Breakfast is included downstairs in a very comfortable lounge area made up of 3 rooms with a variety of seating at dining tables or overstuffed armchairs and couches. CNN is on the flat screen TV's and the cold breakfast was generous. There were yogurts, muffins, donuts, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and more. Most guests were European and it was fun to sit and guess what languages were being spoken. There is also a bar upstairs which is open during nice weather with a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building.The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the location was ideal! We were 1/2 a block from Macy's and maybe 3 blocks from the Empire State Building. It would probably be a great location for Madison Square Garden or Bryant Park visitors. There was a subway entrance very close and a Duane Reade drugstore around the corner. Great location, great service, excellent accommodations! We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great Midtown Hotel We booked this hotel through BA website as they had an offer on and in comparison to other central hotels the price was really reasonable. The 'superior queen' room was nicely decorated, clean and more than adequate for a city break. I'd read so much about small hotel rooms but I found there was enough for us. The bathroom was also nicely decorated with marble basin and a good shower.Ok the elevators are going through some refurbishment but two were working and honestly waiting a couple of extra minutes is no big deal - for us anyway.We couldn't fault the hotel or the staff - they're not in your face but if you needed anything they were helpful and obliging. The free breakfast was a bonus and the location of the hotel is perfect. Macy's and Broadway at one end of the street and 5th Avenue at the other. The Subway station is just a minute down the street connecting you to the joys of the rest of the city. If you're after an above average hotel at a decent rate, this could be for you.

<Content>Would definitely go back We got a fab deal through the BA website and spent a night here before we were due to fly back to the UK. We stayed with friends on the outskirts of NY for the rest of our stay but wanted an evening in Manhattan to have dinner etc. Other friends stayed in another 'top' hotel and payed at least double the price for what was only used as a 'bed for the night'. The room was clean and staff helpful. We had to confirm our BA flights 24 hours before and so were able to confirm flights, book seats and print boarding passes all free of charge.The free coffee and tea just off the lobby was a welcome treat as the snow fell in the city and the breakfast enough to keep us going until well after lunchtime!Our only problem was getting a passing cab to take us to Grand Central to get the airport shuttle. We had to walk (with lots of luggage/shopping) to the main road to flag one down.My mum got lots of 'Senior' discounts around the city without showing any ID. I got 11% off everything (including Sale prices) at Macy's just by going to the Visitor Centre on the first floor and showing ID. A fabulous stay in NYC all round.

<Content>Great Location We wanted a hotel close to MSG. This was a perfect location. Stayed here 2 years ago and liked and the price was good for a city hotel. Clean,nice comp.breakfast.  Two things that bothered me- No doorman - door was heavy and there was quite abit of wind which made it hard to hold and the elevators were VERY VERY slow.

<Content>What a friendly place to stay The hotel is very pretty inside and the people that work there are very nice. They go out of their way to help you with whatever you need. I had heard that the rooms in New York were small. They are small here too. The room I stayed in was perfect for one person. The Queen size bed was very comfortable. The whole room was very clean and well appointed. If you are looking for a luxory hotel, this is not it. However, if you are looking for a good hotel where you can feel safe and is central to downtown Manhattan, this is the one. I would most definitely stay here again.

<Content>Perfect NY hotel I combed through all the Trip Advisor comments before booking at the Metro for July in New York. I'm writing this review to confirm that every good thing you've read is true. The hotel is chic, professional, clean, air-conditioned, convenient and good value for money. Even though I have friends in the New York area, I think I'll stay here in the future.

<Content>Could not fault it! We booked this hotel on the BA website and was attracted by the price. We were not expecting much but were really suprised and pleased. The reception staff were friendly and even though we checked in early they had our room ready and had left a small gift as they knew it was my birthday. Some have commented on the size of the rooms but there was more then enough space. A queen bed, dressing table, a set of drawers, 2 bed side cabinets and a wardrobe big enough for clothes and 2 suitcases! The free safe is inside the wardrobe - which we had trouble working but someone arrived within 10 minutes to help! The view of the ESB from the roof top terrace was great. The hotel is in a great location, really central and close to Times Square. The sub-way is less then a minute from the hotel and a great way to get about. The breakfast was right up my street and certainly enough to keep you going to lunch, huge muffins, toast, bagels, cereal, fresh fruit with tea and coffee on tap all day. The reception staff were helpful and booked an attraction for us as well as arranging our return trip to the airport on the shuttle bus (slightly cheaper then getting a cab but just as good). This is a really great value for money hotel in a excellent location. Would stay here again and would happily recommend.

<Content>great location ,great staff. My wife and i stayed at the metro for four nights in early january.We mainly chose this hotel because it had been recomended by several of our friends who had stayed there before,We could not beileve how well located the hotel was with macy`s at one end of the street and the empire state building at the other end . As this was our first trip to nyc we could not have hoped for a better choice of accomodation . The staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us, We stayedin a queen room which although they are not huge are very clean and tidy with a very comfortable bed , which after a day of hard shopping is a welcome relief. My wife and i will most definitely be staying here again on our next visit to the big apple.

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Staff The hotel itself is very retro in decor so it wouldn't have been my first choice upon booking but due to it being the first week in December there wasn't a lot of vacacnies in this price range so we gave it a chance. We were very please to discover on arrival that the hotel was so central we were looking up at the empire state from our room. The hotel was definitely retro in style but very clean, the maid service was daily and they cleaned above what they needed to. The breakfast was limited but enough to start you for the day (fresh fruit, toast, yoghurts, pastries and muffins), it was all self service so you could get enough to fill! One tip would be to get there early or be prepared to take something back to your room because there are limited seats in the breakfast area. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, it is a very good budget choice in a city where hotels are so expensive.

<Content>Fantastic Stay We stayed at the hotel Metro in early December and had a fantastic time. It was our first time in new york and i wanted to be close to the action so i was very glad to pull up to such a central location. Times square and broadway were about a 10 minute walk away and Macy's was literally down the street. The empire state building was a short walk away aswell. There was a subway station on the street too which was handy when we couldnt actually be bothered to walk to time square (1 stop)! We found that our room was a good size and was very clean. There was a nice flat screen TV and channels galore. Not that we spent much time watching it. We could see the empire state building from our window. Although our window faced the road we were not disturned by any traffic. Which could have been because we were always very tired by the time we came back each evening. The breakfast is free and theres a decent selection.....pastries, cereal, fruit juice ect. We found the people on reception very friendly helpful. They also booked us a taxi when we were leaving.All in all a great room, in a great hotel in an amazing location in an amazing city!

<Content>Great Location, Construction noise.... Overall we had a pleasant stay at the Hotel Metro. The room we had was great, hot tub and flat screen TV in the bathroom. The elevators were very slow and old but to my understanding they are being updated judging by the signs around the hotel. Some minor problems were that the room service wasnt available for much time, but the restaurant was open pretty late so that made up for it. the restaurant in the hotel was fantastic. the staff were plesant and very quick and the food was outstanding. the main problem i had with the stay was the noise from the consruction in the next building. It started extremely early and felt like they were drilling a hole in my head. Other than that it was a good stay. Im sure i will visit again.

<Content>Hotel Metro Never Fails! I first stayed at the Hotel Metro about 8 years ago and over the years have returned when visiting NY either for business or pleasure. There are so many things right with this hotel, starting with the location (right in the heart of mid-town, near the Empire State Bldg and Macys in a neighborhood filled with small markets, pubs ,restaurants AND right next to a subway stop) to the price, and of course the wonderful staff.  I particularly like the free continental b-fest of muffins, bagels, cereal and yogurt) and the free gym which I noticed was recently re-furbished. The bathrooms are not the biggest, nor are the rooms, but this is NY, and how much time do you spend in your room anyway? I did notice this last time that some of the carpets/fixtures in the room were showing their age but when the price, location and staff are this welcoming, who could argue? I highly recommend Hotel Metro and will likely stay there next time I visit wonderful New York City.

<Content>Perfert City Break Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of Dec 2007 and for a city break this has everything you could ask for.The first impression was great because the hotel had beautiful Christmas decorations outside and a friendly concierge waiting to open the doors for you as you step out of the cab.The reception staff were very helpful friendly and knowledgeable and more than happy to answer any questions about subway stops, attractions, fares, even recommending cheap airport transport options....simply anything.The room (ours was a basic double room, not a suite) was very clean, warm and comfortable although a little small but who is going to spend time in their hotel room in NY, apart from sleeping that is?) We had a full bathroom with plenty of hot water, a mini bar (expensive as always but there if you wanted it) a safe, hairdryer and a TV.Every morning a 'continental' breakfast is served and this is complimentary. There was everything to set you up for the day bagels, toast, rolls, cereals, fresh fruit, cheese, yogurts, muffins and pastries. We only drink decaffeinated coffee and were sure we would be unlucky but sure enough it was there on tap and coffee is available in the lounge 24 hours a day, very welcome when you come back from a long day seeing the sights on a cold Dec day.The roof terrace was reported to only be open seasonally but to our delight it was open still in Dec so we assume they mean that the bar up there isn't open all year round but it was wonderful to go up there and see the Empire State building so close up. The location of this hotel is amazing. I would forget the swanky uptown, near Central Park locations and plump for this Midtown location any time. we were able to see both the Empire State and Macy's from our roof terrace (just 2 minutes walk away), the subway station was at the end of the road and Times Sq was just a 10 minute walk away. We didn't try the hotel restaurant but directly opposite the Metro is Brendan's, which is a very traditional diner/bar with high ceilings and mosaic floors, the burgers were good too. Also there were 2 Irish bar/restaurants two minutes along the roadAll in all this hotel had thought of everything you could need on a city break to the Big Apple, there was even a gym if you still had energy after pounding the sidewalks. If there was one complaint it would have to be the lifts which were slow and unable to cope with the packed hotel but they are in the process of renovating these and notices are up apologising for the inconvenience so you can't complain because they are aware and are trying to make them better.We met many people who had stayed at this hotel before and had come back to stay again and we will certainly be among them on our return to wonderful New York!!

<Content>Perfect location for a sightseing/shopping trip A very late review of our stay!We booked 5 nights at Hotel Metro through Virgin Holidays UK. The visit was part of our honeymoon, and one of the main reasons we booked this hotel was the location  roof top bar.We were very disappointed that the roof terrace was closed for renovation as we hadnt been told - Virgin however refunded us 15% of the cost for this.We booked a deluxe room, and was surprised to find this was right opposite the lifts, so we heard the lifts going up  down through the night  people coming  going.The room was quite small, but we expected this having stayed in other NYC hotels previously. It was big enough though for the 2 of us, a LOT of luggage and a small table. Bed very comfy, room very clean, bathroom overflowing with toiletries. Huge TV with a good choice of channels. Free safe inside the wardrobe.The staff were friendly and helpful in booking us airport transfers and making recommendations. We used the free internet service to email home  update them on our wedding  honeymoon which we found really useful.The major selling point of this hotel is the location - in 5 days, we only took 1 taxi (to Ground zero/statue of librety) and could walk everywhere else.15 mins Times Square, less than 5 mins to Macy's/34th street shops  Empire State building, 25mins to Central Park  main 5th Avenue shops, 15 mins to Grand Central.We did get a 48hr all loops tour on Grayline open top buses from Times Square which was brilliant - we got on  off where we wanted to, and it was great for seeing all areas of New York that we may have not took a taxi to or had time to walk to.The night tour was brilliant - especially over the Brooklyn Bridge!Another selling point of the hotel was the breakfast - it was included and there was a good selection. 24hr tea  coffee was fab as well after a long day sightseeing or shopping.I would stay in this hotel again - the small cons were far outweighed by the pros - and would recommend this to anyone -in fact, my parents are booked to stay there for their 1st trip to NYC in 3 weeks time!!If you want luxury then its not for you, but if you want a comfortable, clean place to stay in a fab location that is in a slightly higher class then yor comfort inn/travel inn, then this is the place for you. I dont think you can beat the location of this place!Make sure you take a trip to Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant in Times Square, Top of the Rock (which we thought had better views then Empire State), a carriage ride through Central Park  trip to see the Statue of Liberty.

<Content>great place - 4 years in a row This is the fourth year in a row that I have stayed at Hotel Metro. It is in a great location, right near Macy's and the Empire State Building. It appears that the hotel has now completed it room remodeling, which is great. The staff is nice, and the rooms are sufficiently large. Try to get a room away from the street side, and you'll sleep better. The hotel is always clean. I will book again.

<Content>Great Location We booked this hotel via an airline website. It's located about 50 yards from Macy's and slap bang in the middle of Manhattan. We asked to be moved to a rear room after the first night as it was a bit noisyat the front, but then it was great! Free Breakfast was the Highlight of the whole trip - whilst watching Chrysler adverts on the Breakfast TV (not sure about this one). It is located near to a few pubs, which is great if you like boozing, and it is only 100 yards from the EmpireState. Thumbs up for the reception staff, and there is a nice bar adjacent to the hotel. Rooms are OK size.

<Content>Nice Hotel We picked this hotel with location and price in mind and were not disappointed. For those with the same intentions this hotel was great. Additionally, the staff was great and was quick to respond to any problems and did so in an appropriate manor. The breakfast is included and is something substantial. We would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Enjoyable stay at the Metro Walked from Grand Central to the Metro - found it easy to find, and the art deco bright neon sign was nice and set the tone for the hotel. Check in was quick, the room was very nicely appointed, if small (as I expected). Looked like it had recently been redone, and the linens and pillows made it feel like it was a more upscale hotel. No complaints at ALL about the room. The lobby and breakfast room were also very nice, and art deco styled -- felt very New York. And there's a very good free breakfast, and free coffee or tea anytime, day or night.The lowest point of the hotel is the staff. The doorman regularly would not even attempt to help us with the door, even when we arrived back with large Christmas gifts! The front desk staff were adequate, but one time they continued their conversation well after I'd walked up to the counter. But they recommended a great restaurant -- Brendan's -- so I give them kudos for that!

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed here last month and it was perfect! Good location near Subway and walking distance to Bryant Park and Grand Central Terminal(gorgeous!). We live in Atlanta and were worried about not having enough space Their rooftop bar (closed in the winter but still available) was a perfect refuge for an evening cocktail brought from the room and then out to dinner or room service from the Metro Grill. HUGE portions and pretty good- very good if you've been walking all day. Can't beat the continental breakfast- it's free and you get it before you get ready for the day. Can't say enough about the rooftop- where else in Manhattan can you have 550 square feet to just a few people. Oh, and the windows in the bathroom open to fresh air.

<Content>Great Location, Good Hotel As has been mentioned in other posts, the best part of this hotel is location. Within walking distance to Macy's (important for that Christmas shopping), Times Square, Empire State Bldg, etc. Close to the subway, too, for those places a bit too far away to walk. My room was very large by big city comparisons (most recently the closet called a room I stayed in during my Paris visit), so maybe I just got lucky. No view from my room, but that was OK. I found the staff very helpful and curteous, so not sure where that complaint comes from. Nice older hotel that has evidently been remodeled in the past few years. Good breakfast, etc. Good restaurant attached, and a very good bar and grill right across the street (Brennan's). No complaints, especially for the money.

<Content>Excellent! We stayed here for 6 nights  had a great stay! When we booked the hotel we stated that it was a birthday celebration  that a view of the Empire State Building would be appreciated. This was duly met, along with a small box of chocolates  a message on our phone. We'd stayed in Las Vegas  Toronto before NYC  this was the first hotel to make any concession- well done!The hotel is clean  modern,  whilst I wouldn't describe it as luxurious it is more than comfortable. The room was clean  equipped with plenty of storage, an iron  board, hair dryer  in-room safe, everything we needed. The free breakfast was very good  the staff were polite  unfailingly helpul. There is a gym on the top floor, along with a roof terrace, which although isn't really usable in December, is a great vantage point for photos of the ESB.The best plus point is the location- Broadway, Macys  a subway at one end of the street, Fifth Avenue, the ESB  buses to up  down town at the other, add to that the bars  restaurants within easy walking distance  the location was perfect for us!I would really recommend this hotel  would use it whenever in NYC!

<Content>A Great First Time In NYC At The Metro We stayed at the Metro for 3 nights at the end of November. We booked through Virgin, flew into JFK and had arranged transfers through Virgin to the hotel which took us right to the door. Check in was very effecient and didnt take long. We were allocated a room on the 7th floor opposite the lifts, which did cause us a bit of noise when the lift stopped on our floor late at night.The room was quite spacious. Bed was extremely comfy - particularly after walking round all day. Bathroom was an adequte size with an abundance of toiletries left to use. There was a large TV in a cabinet which offered a good channel choice. Plenty of storage space available for clothes etc plus ironing board and iron. Use of room safe was FREE, really good for keeping documents and money nice and safe while out and about. Use of the internet at the Metro is also FREE and can be booked at reception. No drinks making facilities in room itself but drinks machine available in dining area 24 hours a day and can take them up to rooms.Continental breakfast had a good choice on offer with cereals, fresh fruit, bagels, toast, croissants, jams and extra large size muffins ( which were gorgeous). The dining area is lovely and casual with some chairs and tables but also some armchairs and sofas for those who really like to chill out over breakfast. For those who wanted to, you can take breakfast up to your room. The best thing about the Metro is its location. Right between 5th  6th Avenues, a subway station on the corner of the street and literally a couple of minutes walk to Broadway, the Empire State and Macys. Getting around to anywhere from the Metro was easy!!A couple of recommendations - A traditional NY deli on 5th Avenue called the Green PeaAn American diner off Times Square called Brooklyns (have the cheesecake)An Irish bar off Times Square called O' Lunneys ( very friendly)A Korean bar called Red almost next to the Metro (cocktails $5 on Happy Hour)We are already talking about visiting New York again next December and will stay again at the Metro.

<Content>Great Small Hotel We had a lovely stay at this hotel. It was very smart, clean and all the staff were polite and courteous. Was very apprehensive about which hotel to choose - and I'm glad I chose this one for my first experience of New York.The Continental breakfast was excellent with loads of muffins, croissants, bagels, cereals - it was a good starting point for the day.Our room was small, clean and very cosy - but then again what more do you need when you're in New York.Thumbs up to the Metro from me and thanks for a lovely stay.PS Ladies Macey's is only a 5 minute walk.

<Content>Excellent location; decent hotel We chose the Metro Hotel on 35th Street street, as it was recommended by our Tavel Agent for it's excellent Manahattan location. The location is ideal - about 10 mins away from Time Square, literally round the corner from the Empire State Building and with the nearest subway only a couple of minutes away.Room were very tidy, air conditioned and are cleaned daily. The rooms include a TV and a safe. My complaint about the room is that we had a brick wall in our direct view from the window. Although the bathroom was well maintained, it is really small.The hotel has a nice 30s art-deco theme throughout. The restaurant is overpriced and it is better to eat from outside the hotel, as it is better value for money. The free daily breakfast is nice, and a good mix of cakes, breads, fruit, cereals and drinks are available. Reception staff can be approachable at times, but rude at other times, depending on how busy they are. Ideal only for it's location, but would consider trying out another hotel within the same area when i return to NYC.Approx times from hotel to:Empire State Building - few minutes walkTime Square - 10 minute walkGroundZero - 10 mins (subway)Madison Square Garden - 10 minute walkFifth Avenue - 15 minute walk

<Content>Disapointed with treatment We booked the 2 bedroom family suite for 5 nights. The 2 bed family suite contains 2 twin beds in one room and 1 queen bed in a seperate room. There were 4 adults traveling in the group. I contacted the reservations department to see if this room would accomate 4 adults as the max amount of prople allowed to stay in this room according to there website was 2 which i found strange as it was a 2 bedroom suite. The reservations department confirmed the price for 4 adults sharing the 2 bedroom suite and we booked it. Appon arrival at the hotel when we checked in we were told that there would be an extra charge per person per night beacause there were 4 adults staying in the suite. We told them that when making the reservation we were told that the room could accomadte 4 adults at the price comfirmed on the internet and we weren't told about any extra charges. The girl at reception told us that we would have to talk to the reservations manager the next morning to sort the problem out and i agreed to come down at 9 the next morning to talk to him. When i arrived down at reception there was another girl on duty and i asked for the reservations manager as planned and was asked what the problem was. After explaining the problem all over again, i was told that i would have to talk to the manager over the phone as he was to busy to talk to me directly. I was then told to come back later that day to talk to him on the phone. When i retutrned i was told by the same girl that i couldn't talk to him and that she had explained the problem to him and he said we had to pay extra. We had to end up paying the extra as we had nowhere else to go. I was mad that they didn't want me talking to the manager and i say by there attidue that they didn't even bother to talk to him. The hotel was lovely and location was great but due to an error on there behalf that left us paying extra i wouldn't stay there again. Just be aware of all extra costs when booking your room!

<Content>Couldnt swing a cat! I booked a room at the Metro based on all the good reviews it has received. Whilst I agree that the hotel is in a good location and the rooms are very clean, I am shocked that nobody has commented on the ridiculously small size of the rooms. My room was so small that the bathroom door couldnt open more than half way as it hit against the bed. I also had to put my suitcase at the side of the bed as there was nowhere else I could put it so I couldnt get in the bed from that side.I also couldnt sleep properly as the air conditioning was really loud.I am not a fussy person and I have stayed in comparative star hotels before, but I really cannot be the only person to have had a problem with this.

<Content>Hotel let down by staff, totally lacking in enthusiasm We stayed here as the reviews looked quite good and it was in a good location. I loved New York, amazing city - was so excited as my first visit. The hotel reception staff however need to learn how to smile - they were so miserable, particularly one girl who worked in the mornings. The way I can describe it is that their glum face and general un friendliness kind of burst your bubble of enthusiasm everytime you had to walk past them. I would definitely not stay there again, nor recommend the hotel for this reason. They need to cheer up!I accept totally that people could have been going through a bad patch and we may have been just unlucky as there have been some good reviews. There are so many hotels in NY though, we would not go back to this one.The hotel itself was ok - good location. Check the bill as we were initially overcharged for the mini bar (over charge was deducted as we checked the bill).

<Content>Good Value We stayed at the Hotel Metro for 5 nights from 28th Oct. We booked with Virgin in the UK and also pre-booked all our excursions. We had 2 'Superior ' rooms on the 2nd floor, one for my husband and I, and one for our teenage daughters. Both rooms were a decent size, well furnished with comfy double beds and well equipped bathrooms. There was plenty of hot water and the shower was very powerful. The towels were changed daily and the toiletries replaced. The rooms were up only one flight of stairs so we never had to use the lifts, other than to go and check out the roof top terrace/bar which gave a very close up view of the Empire State Building.The only problem with one of the rooms was that it was on the front of the hotel and the noise from 3.00am, on the street ,was horrendous eg collection of garbage, deliveries etc. If possible request a room at the back of the hotel, the only noise our daughters heard was the hum from an outside air-con unit.The reception staff/concierge were very friendly and helpful ,always enquiring if we needed any directions etc. The breakfast was also very good with enough choice to get you well fed before venturing out. We liked the informal lounge where you sat to eat it. Coffee/Tea was available free at any time.The hotel was quite well placed for all the sights particularly the ESB and Maceys. Go to the ESB at night if you can, there's hardly any queues but remember to take some ID with you - they prefer it if you've got a photocopy of your passport. Having pre-booked all our sightseeing/excursion tickets before we travelled we were very pleased to find these waiting for us at the hotel when we arrived. I would recommend doing this if you want to do a Helicopter Flight or a trip to Niagra which we did. One word of warning though - the Niagra trip (by air) is a very long day - pick up at 6.15am arrive back at the hotel at 10.30pm. Having said that, its a great trip and very quiet at this time of year. The Maid of the Mist ride finishes on the 24th Oct so we were disappointed to miss this as the Virgin rep had said it ran until 31st Oct.We would definitely stay at this hotel again - it is slightly old fashioned, but very well run, clean, handily placed and represents good value for money.

<Content>Great Hotel We just returned from a 4 day visit to New York. This hotel was a 4 min walk from Macys and 5 mins from The Empire State building. We were on the 6th floor at the front of the Hotel. The street noise was not excessive but all streets in New York have traffic and beeping horns. A pair of earplugs helps. The lifts were slow but as we were on the 6th floor we used the stairs ( for going down!). The room was a standard room, good bed, clean bathroom. The breakfast in the morning was great. It got busy at different times but some people just took what they wanted back to their rooms. I would class this hotel as a tourist hotel not really for business travellers. The staff were polite but did not have much dealing with them except when they stored our bags and called a cab when we were leaving. All in all it was a success and would go back.

<Content>Very disappointing We called ahead after making our 5-night booking online to specify that we were two males and a double bed would not be appropriate, but we were allocated to a room with a queen bed that would have been tight even for a couple.  The manager told us there was nothing he could do. His reasoning was that the small print at the bottom of the reservation stated that rooms suitable for a couple or two singles were available for the booking we had made, and because we had a room suitable for a couple, the hotel had met its obligations.  It was also clear that twin rooms were available throughout our stay; we heard other people being offered the choice of a twin or a double on checking in, and saw a number of twin rooms being made up after guests had checked out. We suspect that the twin rooms were being held because they command a higher rate. The only concession we were offered was some extra blankets to enable one of us to sleep on the floor!  Other than this, the hotel was basic. The photos on the website make it look rather fancy, but while clean, the decor is quite old and rather shabby past the reception area. The spectacular-looking rooftop bar, which is presented as a major feature on the website, was closed the whole time we were there. We were informed that its opening was seasonal.  Our room was small, as was the bathroom, which had no fan or ventilation of any kind. Water leaked onto the floor through the closed shower door.  We ended up using the stairs for much of the time because the lifts were slow to the point of being unusable. Request a lower floor if you do decide to stay here.  The location of the hotel is very convenient, but there are many other conveniently located hotels in Manhattan. We would not stay here again.

<Content>A very well located clean hotel I stayed at the Hotel Metro for six nights on business. Whilst I was slightly reticent at the prospect of staying in Midtown - which is hardly the nicest part of Manhatten - I was actually pleasantly surprised all 'round.Location wise, you are a very short walk indeed from either 34 Herald (N,Q,R,W trains if you're going downtown to Wall Street/Battery Park and Liberty Island and the B,D,F and V trains if you're off to Queens or the Lower East Side, both of which are worth a visit) and only another block again to Penn Station. You're two blocks from Time Square and two again to the Empire State Building and only from Macys. It's only a ten to fifteen minute walk up to the top of Fifth Avenue if you want to take in the sights as well.But, the best part is that despite being in such a great location, you're not slap bang in the middle of the tourist horror traps of Time Square. You don't step out of the hotel into the latest wave of back-packing students, or hoardes of tour groups that insist on standing the full width of the pavement.The hotel itself is modest, but was spotless, as was my room. I have stayed in more expensive hotels that have not provided a room as immaculate as the one I stayed in.One tip, though - if you can, ask for a room at the back of the hotel. The rooms on the front can be noisy on account of passing traffic (it's not a busy road, but New Yorkers tend to use their horns at every possible opportunity). It didn't help that next door but one to the hotel is a construction site that was operating 24 hours a day. The bed was very comfortable, the pillows a generous size and the housekeeping staff attentive and civil. Whilst the hotel may be looking a little dated, it's not horrific and was very clean throughout.The fitness studio was very good indeed. Sorry to labour the point, but there are more expensive hotels out there that provide nothing more than a few mismatching dumbells and a third-hand treadmill. The fitness equipment was very new, offered a good range of choice and the area was air-conditioned and served by two huge flat screens. On the roof of the hotel is a very unusual and pleasant terrace which offers some nice views and must be very nice in the summer months.My room had a new iron and ironing board in the room, a decent safe, decent size TV and a speaker system that will fit your iPod, so you can even take your favourite tunes with you.If you want a magnificant, opulent hotel that will rip you off on the room rate and cost of breakfast - rather then the very ample and free breakfast consisting of a big range of different bagels, breads, fresh juice, coffee, breakfast cereals, yoghurts etc served at the Metro - then this isn't for you.Considering the price, the great location and standards of the rooms, it's certainly worth giving serious thought to staying here. I was a satisfied guest of the Metro and would stay there again. This hotel is particuarly suitable for tourists who want the convenience of being Midtown but who don't want to be right on top of Times Square and the associated noise and problems that brings. In addition, if you're on business, you're very well placed to take a short walk uptown or hop on the Metro to go to Wall Street.

<Content>Great hotel Pros: Very very clean, close to tourist spots (especially Madison Square Garden and Empire State Building), inexpensive (compared to typical NY hotel prices), decent breakfast, helpful staff.Cons: Small room, dirty outside surroundings, occasional late-night vehicle noises.We did a lot of research to find a reasonably-priced good hotel (this website's reviews helped a lot), and this was a great find. Overall, this hotel is very good, and we would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Unhappy Metro Guest This was my second time at the Metro; I booked a room there because my first impressions had been so positive. This time, however, I had a number of problems and even though the location is great, probably won't go back. The only rooms available were directly opposite the elevators, which emit a very loud DING DONG every time they stop at a floor -- not conducive to peaceful repose. There was only one really functional elevator (a sign posted announced that they were doing an elevator revitalization project) and therefore it took a long time to get up and down -- the service elevator was also usable, but took equally long and frequently--no surprise-- was full of cleaning carts and plumbers. The mini bar was empty -- except for one can of coke -- and on inquiring I was told that they were refurbishing the mini-bars, upgrading them, but hadn't gotten around to all the rooms yet! The business center is a joke -- you have to check out a special key card at the front desk, with a time limit of a half hour. I discovered this one morning when I'd spent several minutes of futility inserting my own key card. Having just stocked up on coffee and a muffin in the breakfast room, I went down one flight to the lobby to ask why my room key didn't work -- and was informed by the desk clerk that no food or drinks were allowed in the business center, and that before he let me sign the key out, I had to leave the coffee/muffin in my room. Since I didn't want to spend another five or more minutes trying to get the elevator up to and back from the ninth floor, I said that I'd just leave the grub outside the business center room while I checked my email. He reiterated that it was hotel policy not to take food in there. I said I wasn't challenging that and would leave it on the table outside the room. He kept hassling me about it until finally I invited him to follow me up there so that he, personally, could verify that I wasn't taking any forbidden substances in with me! At that point, he said, suit yourself, and with a great show of reluctance let me have the key. I don't think I've ever encountered such offensive and disrespectful behavior in any hotel, in NYC or elsewhere. To be fair, there were some very pleasant people on the staff as well, and the room itslef was comfortable, spacious, and clean. But I can't imagine anything that might induce me to stay there next time I'm in New York -- or ever again! Even if they stock the mini bars!

<Content>Great deal for NYC, and perfect for families We booked the suite that includes one large room with two queen beds, another bedroom with one queen bed, and one bathroom. I was in NYC with my parents, so this was a perfect and economical set up for us ($450/night for the suite). The hotel is clean, the staff friendly, it's located a half block from a major subway line and a half block from 5th Avenue, and it includes a perfectly adequate breakfast buffet to get you going in the morning (yogurt, fruit, cereal, muffins, bagels, etc). My mom can't walk long distances well, so we ate near the restaurant most nights. The Metro Grill (attached to the restaurant) was much better than I expected it to be and was quite reasonably priced. There are several Korean restaurants on the block. We ate at the one two doors down from the hotel twice, and it was very good. The hotel isn't fancy, but it is clean and the rooms are well appointed. I highly recommend it, especially for price compared to other hotels in NYC.

<Content>Brilliant Trip September 2007 - Virgin Altantic We went to New York to celerbrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary, the staff at the Metro were more than friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Rooms were clean and more than comfortable, as its the city that never sleeps.! Breakfast was sufficient, fresh and ample 24 hr coffee on tap.The Location was the best thing - Macy's one block away, and easy access to every where, walk and enjoy - we did Hop on Hop Off bus tour - well worth a day or two day pass - great tour operators and fun. Times Square comes alive at Night - dont forget that Show! Walk and enjoy the amopshere, in the evening and if you get chance Juniors for that something to eat - We would'nt have any quibles in returning back to the Hotel Metro as we are already planning it, once Freedom Tower is built - or we might be able to squeeze a trip in prior to that.

<Content>A geat free breakfast! After much teeth gnashing having read so many poor reviews of NY hotels, we finally settled on the Metro. The location is okay, very near Macy's and with enough bars and eating places to choose from after along day's sight seeing. I booked a double room which is what we got. There was one bed and the room was very compact. It had a decent shower cubicle within the very small bathroom and also had iron and ironing board, free safe etc. I would recommend that you book a twin room as you will get 2 double beds and a much much bigger room. The hotel has a very pricy roof bar, but a great view of the Empire State building. Worth a visit if only on the first night. There is a gym too on the top floor.The hotel provides free hot drinks all day and a great free breakfast: juice, hot drinks, fruit, cereal , yoghurt etc as well as all the baked goods you would expect in the US. Breakfast is available until 11am. Overall, this is a good hotel, clean, safe and close to subways. Times Square is a 10 min walk away.

<Content>Good Location - Good Accomodations The hotel room was not spacious, but was very clean and quiet. We had no problems with the elevators, as some of the other reviewers have suggested. The hotel was working on the elevators, but they always arrived promptly during our five day stay. The wireless internet access was not working properly, but it was also being repaired. The computers in the business center are extremely slow and should only be used as a last resort.The hotel's location is great. In the middle of midtown and close to a subway station. You can hop right on and be anywhere in NYC in a matter of minutes.The front desk personnel were adequate, but not extremely friendly. The bellman was very helpful and had a cab waiting for us when we were ready to depart for the airport. The housekeeping department did a great job and the room was always clean and restocked with supplies.On my next trip to NYC, I will likely stay here again.

<Content>Check him out! Beware of the little signs throughout the lobby that say, no food or drink in this area. I was sipping on a cup of coffee at 9 AM when the owner walked by and asked me if I knew how to read (like I'm a child or something). A minute later he came back and told his staff at the front desk to check him out!. I'm totally serious...He was actually doing me a favor because I will NEVER stay in his dump hotel EVER again and neither will anyone else from my company. For $420 a night, I'd rather stay at any other hotel in Manhattan where the guest is welcome. Cheap furniture made in China (that the owner is so protective of) is what to expect at Hotel Metro. No water pressure in the shower, slow (crowded) elevators that take forever to get up to the 12th floor. Rooms smell of rotten fish from the Korean restaurant next store. I can go on and on but this place is not worth it. Stay far way from this dive hole-in-the-wall and the better off you'll be. Take my word for it.

<Content>Ideal location and great muffins! Although a little shabby once you progress from the lobby this hotel is ideally situated for all the tourist needs. Our room was on the 11th floor and was quite small, hot water seemed limited and never available after 9pm. On the plus side the continental style breakfast is good and has muffins to die for. Free cofffee and tea are available 24 hours in the lounge area which is also an advantage. We booked through virgin who use this hotel frequently.

<Content>Loved the small hotel off the beaten path Metro is a small, off the beaten-path hotel on w35th St in NYC. It was clean and attractive inside. The room was ample enough to live, store luggage, and do some work. Free WiFi throughout the hotel is a big plus. The staff is super friendly, and the courtesy continental breakfast is excellent. It is a short walk on 35th St to either 5th or 6th AV, which are major thoroughfares through downtown Manhattan. Restaurant and bar were well above average.

<Content>Great location My Mom and I just returned from a three night stay here and we loved it! Had a queen size bed - room not huge but definitely ample for two people. You aren't going to be in there much anyway! Great location - we felt safe walking around at night. Helpful staff - they gave excellent directions to every attraction we wanted to visit. The included breakfast is a great bonus - bagels, muffins, yogurt, granola, etc. This saved us some money and was a nice way to start the day. You can be at Macy's within 5 minutes and in Times Square in just over 10 minutes. We were nervous about the subway at first but when we return we will ride it from day one. Metro staff told us how many stops to expect and where to go when the train stops. The view of the Empire State Building from the rooftop terrace is awe inspiring. I suggest walking up in the daytime and at night when it is lit up for some beautiful photos. The only complaint we had was that the elevators were painfully slow but they were working on them so that should be improved soon.

<Content>Will Return Again We stayed at Hotel Metro for the very first time a couple of days before Christmas in 2006. The room that we stayed is smaller, and the view from our room faced the alley. Not the best view but it's very Hopper-like. Our room was located next to the elevator, which was a little loud but not problematic. The hotel staff members were really friendly and helpful. The best thing about the hotel was the breakfast! A wide range of selection everyday! Kudos to the chefs and cooking staff! The hotel is located just down the road from great shops, like Macy's! Also, check out the Korean restaurant (Hanbat restaurant) near the hotel. It opens late, service is fast, and food is so yummy and inexpensive. Bryant park also is a few blocks from the hotel. The hotel is in a great location, but it's quiet at night. We definitely will return again!

<Content>Very nice Nice stay, clean room, nice employees and so central ! Between broadway and the Fith ave., it's perfect! I recommand this hotel a lot. I had no view of the city in my room but it's was very quiet.Nice to know, they give a discount rate for clients if you want to park your car in the center parking in front of the hotel (20$ per day).

<Content>Average hotel for a good price Being that hotel prices in Manhattan are ridiculously high, I searched high and low to find a reasonably priced hotel. The Hotel Metro fit the bill in that it: was in a good location, had good ratings, had a reasonable (for NYC) price.The pros:* Excellent location within walking distance of Time Square and the Theatre District* WONDERFUL continental breakfast! Lots of variety, clean/organized presentation and lots of places to sit with friends or alone watching CNN on large screen TVs.* FREE WiFi in the rooms* The staff was helpful and efficientThe cons:* SOOOO Noisy! I was on the 9th floor, had brought ear plugs and turned on the air conditioner and TV to drown out the street noise and it still hardly worked one night. There must be a garbage collection right below here as I could hear the dumpsters getting thrown around for hours?!?* The rooms and especially the bathrooms are small (I understand its NYC, I'm just warning people - compared to the two other hotels I've stayed in here, they're small).* No bathtub, just corner shower (not a problem for me, but again, informational)* Garbage left under the bed the first night, a note to the maid (along with my regular tip) cleared that up quickly.* Slightly musty smell in the bathroom, but I may be especially sensitive as I've noticed it in many of the more historic hotels.Overall I rate this as average, sorry to everyone who loved it, but I just didn't think it was all that special. If its the right price, I'd certainly recommend it as there's nothing seriously wrong with the hotel, but I just can't rave about it as others have.

<Content>Loved the Metro Lovely hotel, the location is fantastic, particularly if you stay in December as you are virtually on Macy's doorstep which takes care of the Christmas shopping. Nice touch with the breakfasts and coffee is available all day which is nice when you have just come in from the freezing cold. The staff were always helpful and courteous and you are unlikely to find a similar standard of hotel at the same rate anywhere else in midtown Manhattan.

<Content>Just about ok for the price... Very poor impression of the metro. The staff was rude and unhelpful (the man on reception checked us in whilst he was on the phone - when the smoke alarm went off and we called reception they said they'd come up and didn't etc), the room was rather small and nothing special, the air conditionning was extremely noisy, etc. The only thing it has going for it is a good location (small street off 5th avenue) and a decent breakfast included in the price. I guess at NYC prices, you get what you pay for...Roof terrace was closed so couldn't enjoy that either.

<Content>Great Location and Reasonably good hotel The best three things about this hotel were the great location , cleanliness of the rooms and the breakfast bagels and muffins.I was part of a party of six staying in 3 rooms. Getting a good sized room seems to be a matter of luck. Of the three rooms one was huge, another was smaller but still a good size and another was extremely small. Rooms were very clean, reception staff were fairly helpful but could have been better. Decor was ok but looked in need of refreshment. Having a drink on the rooftop terrace was nice although expensive. Wasn't impressed at the service charge being included as I didn't consider the service to be particularly good. We had food up there one evening and I wish we hadn't bothered. I have to admit my review of the hotel might be a bit better if I hadn't been comparing it to the courtyard marriot hotel which I stayed in, in New York last year. It was perfect but I didn't book it this year as the rates for September were much more expensive than the hotel metro. So I suppose for the money the metro was ok.We all had a fantastic holiday in New York and my advice to anyone considering a booking with this hotel is that if in comparison with other possible midtown choices you find the price is right then go ahead and book.

<Content>Pleasant Stay From Start to Finish I'd like you to consider disregarding many of the reviews of Hotel Metro that seemed to nit-pick. YES, the elevators are small and slow, and yes, there's construction next door that ties things up a bit and makes for some early weekday clatter. Otherwise, I really liked this hotel and can recommend it completely. Pleasant front-desk help, great location near the 34th St. subway station, delightful complementary continental breakfast, clean, well-appointed rooms, and a cool rooftop patio with an incredible view of the Empire State Building. It's not a resort or a five-star hotel. But for the money I don't think you'll be at all disappointed at the Hotel Metro. As a disclaimer, I should add that through some unique alignment of the planets, or a stroke of good karma for your correspondent, my reservation through hotels.com for a basic room was upgraded to a penthouse room at no charge. I don't exactly live on a farm, but staying in the lap of (increased) luxury tends to influence one's perceptions of experiences. I hope you strike similar good fortune when staying at Hotel Metro in NYC.

<Content>Awesome value for money This hotel is near perfection considering low price by Manhattan standards. Rooms are fair size, bed was comfortable, bathrooms are bigger than other hotels we have stayed at in NYC and breakfast was a good way to start the day. Drink prices are steep on roof top patio but spectacular view!We will be back.

<Content>Not good value for money This boutique hotel is located in midtown Manhatten in the shadow of the Empire State building and a short walk form Grand Central and Penn Stations. If location is everything then this might be an hotel for you.The rooms are among the smallest in New York City and the furnishings are cheap and poor quality. The furnishings looked are old and well-used. The bathroom was tiny. The room was tiny and looked like a warehouse closet that had been covered with sealer (the paint that is sprayed on and looks something like white cement) with some effects added that looked like they came from a flea market. The bed was small but comfortable for two average size people. The breakfast is average.For US$200 night is is an okay hotel. For more than that it is not value for money and I would look around in NYC for sometign better.

<Content>Great Location and accommodating staff. Similar to the previous review, through Orbitz had booked a 'double' room requesting by email and by phone a two twin room - but arrived with no twin beds available (only a single double bed). Fortunately, without additional cost they upgraded us to a double double (two double beds) at no additional cost. This was only available since the hotel wasn't that full (it was the Thursday before Labor Day in NYC - PERFECT time for a less than crowded visit). Again it was George that saved the day! This is a fabulous location. A block from Empire State Building- we went to Empire at 11pm for a night view - again, best time, no crowds. Also, on the 11th floor of Hotel Metro was an outdoor patio - very nice. The room was very clean and large enough. George did recommend that their preferred online site is Expedia (but the day I was booking my reservations the Expedia site was not working...). So maybe with Expedia the twin room can be booked.

<Content>Fantastic stay at the Metro I took my boyfriend away for his birthday and as it was his first visit to NYC I wanted everything to be perfect. He is also quite hard to please when it comes to hotels and as I had been to NYC before I knew how hard it was going to be to find decent accommodation for a reasonable price. As always I scoured trip advisor and found the Hotel Metro was ticking many of my boxes. What we found when we arrived at the hotel exceeded every expectation and more. The location is absolutely perfect. It is right in the middle of all of the hustle and bustle of Manhattan but 35th street itself (street of the hotel) is a little oasis of calm in between all the madness. The staff were so friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough to help me organise surprise birthday treats. The room was really clean (lovely toiletries) and every day we came back to a made bed and fresh towels. Also, if you want to counteract all the food you end up eating then there is a fantastic air conditioned gym on the penthouse floor complete with big screen tv. This in turn leads out onto a lovely roof terrace. It's a nice place to chill in the morning and a busy little place to have drinks in the evening. One of the great sellers for the hotel is the complimentary breakfast. This is hard to find in NYC but was a perfect way to start the day. There was a great choice of fresh fruit, bagels, toast, muffins etc and we would have been lost with out it.I really can't recommend this Hotel enough. It is a real lottery to find decent places to stay and still not spend ridiculous money for the privilege. With the Hotel Metro you will have definitely won the jackpot. If it can more than satisfy a fussy couple like us then it must be doing something right.

<Content>Robbed.... The elevators were not fully operational.We were given a room with a window facing a brick wall.The customer service was deplorable.And my girlfriend had approximately $2000 of jewellery stolen from our room!!! Ok, like the lady at the front desk told me, we should have used a safe. Slip of the mind, but some requisite sympathy would have been nice, rather than been rudley asked how can we be sure that her jewellery is still not in the room(!) after we had explained that the thief (or thieves) had gone through our luggage to remove our valuables. Visit this hotel at your peril. The worst I have ever stayed in. 2 years ago, I stayed at The Waldorf Astoria, NYC, which was the finest city hotel I have frequented. It seems that low budget NY hotels like this one can prove to cost more when theft occurs. Or unlike us, take insurance for peace of mind.I would not wish this experience upon anybody. Please take heed.

<Content>Great location and breakfast I stayed at Hotel Metro in mid August 2007, with my sister. On arrival we had we requested a twin room via booking through a website and I was very disappointed to find that we did not have a twin room.We were told that because we had booked through a website, a twin room could not be guaranteed unless booking direct with the hotel. Not a good start to a 5 night trip!! Especially as iIhad rung the night before to ensure we had a twin room. However by the next day, one of the hotel staff , George, came to the rescue and was able to move us to a twin room. He was polite, helpful, friendly and charming and really improved our stay at the Hotel Metro. If you want a twin room or anything else for that matter, ring the hotel directy and speak to George if posssible. The hotel was also in a great location, 200 yards from the metro (buy a 7 day metro card- really economical if you are using the subway a lot) and round the corner from Macys and 5th Ave. Also the complimentay breakfasts (muffins, toast, pastries, cereal etc) from 6-11am was a real added bonus, along with coffee available all day. The rooms were a great size (for New York) though bathrooms a little small but functional. We had a great 6 days, shopping (Century 21-great! 11% discount card available for visitors at Macys and Bloomies) and eating ( Book restaurants beforehand, especially weekends) !! The hotel can arrange a transfer to a NY airport when you leave the busy city for home!!

<Content>Great location, a real gem I just wanted to add a review for Hotel Metro to endorse most of the comments added.We stayed in November 2006 for 6 nights on our first trip to New York. The hotel is in a fantastic location with Macy's and the Empire State building very near by.The room was very clean and maid service excellent. The room was average sized with the bed very comfortable and a great shower. There were fresh towels daily and the bed was also changed every day.We found the staff very helpful and always friendly. Our in room safe was not working and within 15 minutes of reporting to reception a maintenence guy knocked on our door and fixed it. The reception staff were always willing to help with queries and booked us some tours and the airport taxi service with no problems.The 24 hour coffee in the lobby was always appreciated. We needed to ask for fresh milk a couple of times but this was sorted with a smile! The breakfast was plentiful every morning consisting of bagels, muffins and fresh fruit.The rooftop terrace looks out onto the Empire State building and is a lovely place to sit in the evening after being on your feet all day. Being November it was never busy but I bet in summer it gets crowded.We would recommend this hotel to any traveller. We will certainly be booking to stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at the Hotel Metro for one night when I was in NYC for a concert. We chose the hotel for the positive reviews and the proximity to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. It was only a few blocks away. I thought the price was high, but that's NYC. When we checked in, we were actually upgraded to a family suite, not that we needed it. The rooms were lovely and very clean. The bedding and pillows were very comfortable. The ceilings were high, adding to the spacious feeling of the rooms. The continental breakfast was good, with the standard mix of bagels, pastries, cereals, yogurts, coffee, tea, and juice. I would definitely stay at Hotel Metro again if I needed to stay in this part of Manhattan.

<Content>thanks to other reviewers Firstly thanks to all reviewers of the Metro  other NYC hotels - we studied them carefully but decided the Metro was the most likely to suit us best  I think it did.Room size is a lottery, ours 1215, was small by any standard ( except maybe cheaper hotels in Paris ) however 1214 was large as was 1209 opposite the lifts.The bathroom was minute but well planned  the shower was good. Towels  toiletries good. The air con was a little noisy. The room was very well appointed with top quality furnishings,spotlesslyy clean  a very comfortable bed. The mini bar was hopeless beverages would have been cooler out of it. I asked for it to be fixed  George displayed great empathy but it remained useless for the whole of our stay. There is a lot of building work adjacent to the hotel  therefore it may be noisy at the front. We had requested a high up room  were offered a choice of front or back by charming receptionist.Breakfast is cereals,fruit,yogurt,muffins  bagels - all self service  disposable cutlery,plates,bowls etc. Very good  no signs encouraging tips.Staff friendly. Terrace bar a bit of a dissapointment - plastic glasses  tacky signs saying table service only The location as widely reported is fantastic 34th str subway station is 100yds from hotel - yes on 35th Str.All day fun pass on subway  buses $7 - less than the minimum fare on the London tube!! Cleaner than the tube as well. Ignore any reports of it being in a poor,rough or run down neighbourhood. Its just spoilt a little by the building work  scaffolding nearby however there is building work  scaffolding ALL over New York incl 5th Ave  The Waldorf Astoria.it cost $280 a night which is more than we would have liked but compared to all the others that we researched it seemed to be good value certainly helped by free tea  coffee  a good breakfast served from 6.30 until 11.00am . Whilst Hotel was slightly more than would have been ideal everything else seemed either cheap or good value - of couse almost 拢2 to the pound helped.! We were there during a heatwave  that may have been partly to blame for poor air con in corridors  especially the lift. We enjoyed our stay , didnt mind our small room  feel that we wouldnt have done any better for the price.Whilst in NYC consider an off Broadway show Tony  Tina's wedding - do yr own research it wont appeal to all. we loved it.

<Content>Lovely, Pleasant, central ,NY Hotel Hotel Metro on the 35th Street NY is an excellent hotel to stay.We had 4 nights in NY so we had very little time so we wanted to stay in the city.The hotel itself is very well situated from all attractions,especially if you want to pick up a HOP_ON_OFF bus terminal which is mins. away,next to empire states building.Staff were good,rooms were clean,breakfast was good,what more could one want.I could not fault this hotel,i certainly will go to this hotel again.

<Content>A Good Find! We had won a 5 night trip to New York that included this hotel.It is in a great location - you can walk everywhere! We didn't get one taxi - lots of blisters though!!! You can be in Macy's within 1 minute and at Empire State Building within 5 mins!Room was large - Bathroom small.Hotel is in little need of some TLC - it was very dissappointing that the roof terrace was closed as this is supposed to be a hi light of this hotel.Hotel bar is great for that cold beer at the end of the day!Try Keens Chop House just round the corner - fabulous!Would I return? Maybe......

<Content>Don't go to Hotel Metro. Room was extremely tiny. Rude staff. No one helped us with our luggage getting settled in. Has got to be the most horrible service i've had in a long time.

<Content>Perfect location, great customer service I have been to New York City for four straight years and stayed in average hotels and first class hotels. My favorite was the Hotel Metro because of the staff, location, and rooms. The room was clean and spacious (suggest upgrading to the double bed size - it's large considering others in NYC). The front desk staff was very helpful and pleasant. The hotel was close to Times Square, subway and Macys. Hint: the rooftop bar was very popular, so go early and get a seat. The fitness center was clean and everything worked. I checked on different sites for rates and got different prices, so check all the resources- don't forget to empty the temporary files and cookies on your computer when you check around, the web site will remember the rates that were previously given to you and won't change unless you update them every time you go to the same web site.

<Content>don't believe the odd negative review I had a panic when I read a negative review of this hotel just before I stayed there but decided to go for it and was pleased I did. Yes the area is not the leafy Upper east side but the location is amazing in terms of the subway and Empire State. I couldn't fault the hotel and the staff were excellent and very helpful. Don't believe the negatives and go for it!

<Content>Loved the Metro! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Metro in Feb 2007 for our first trip to NYC. We both absolutely loved it!! The staff were always very friendly, one in particular, the receptioninst George was always very helpful, and was always smiling and chatting. The rooms were very clean, and were immaculately cleaned by the time we got back for the night. The breakfast was nice, it was the same everyday, but there was lots of it and it was good to set you up for a day walking around the city! We are going back to NYC in November, and wanted to stay at the Metro again, but it was a little too expensive for that time at year, but I would definately reccommend it!!

<Content>Some positives, mostly neutral, great location Please have patience whilst I get something off my chest - why are some of the other reviewers basing tsome of their criticism on some neighbourhood properties  some of the hotel guests being of Far East origin??? I think that closed-minded travellers who wish to visit somewhere that does not contain a 'melting pot' of cultures are rather naive in choosing to visit New York. Afterall, isn't the wonderful preponderance of Minority Ethnic neighbourhoods, cultures  cuisines one of the truly great things about New York?? Plus, the restaurants referred to ignorantly as 'Chinese' are actually Korean. And the rubbish that was left outside them was the same rubbish left outside every NY restaurant every night!!! OK, the hotel - not brilliant, but not bad either. Luckily we did not come across any evidence of mice at all, and may feel defirrently if we had. The hotel seems expensive compared to other US destinations, but is a pretty standard price for London for example, and you expect higher prices for NY. Our room was very small (but again we expected that) but very clean. We enjoyed the MP3 docking station/speaker unit, the breakfast was useful (toast, bagels, fruit, yoghurts, chesse, ham, cereal, danish pastries, muffins, TC  juice), and the 24/7 TC was very very useful. The staff were neither friendly nor rude, they got the job done in a quiet non-chatty way - so nothing to rave about, but crucially no complaints either. The lifts were limited  slow, so we often took the stairs, but again - you only have to wait 2 or 3 minutes  it would arrive. We didn't have any problems with noise  we thought the location was superb - v close to subway stop/Macys/Empire State Building. THe area felt very safe, we often returned at 22.00 to 01.00 and didn't feel worried about doing so- the 24 hour Korean restaurants next door help this as there is always a pretty lively crowd outside. There is a newsagents to the left of the hotel for drinks  papers, the area is slightly whiffy - but it only takes you 1 minute to walk through it  then you're back in the excitement of New York. This hotel is a perfectly decent place from which to see NY, it is better than 'basic' but not luxurious, the rooftop bar is still closed. If you just want somewhere to bed for the night, get a decent shower, good air con, have a cup of tea after hitting the city  a free breakfast to get you ready for the day - this is it. Just don't expect huge rooms, smiley 'have a nice day' service  low prices. (Extras - if you're buying an iPod in NY make sure it is actually the gB requirement you need - don't accept the sellers reassurances that 'this is 8gB' for example - especially around Times Sqaure. Bargain hard, walk away  the price gets knocked down by $$$- over $150 off the asking price for a Sony camera for us. Half price ticket booths for Theatre tix are well worth it despite the wait of up to 2hrs - great seats, especially for Weds matinees - for $55. Chicago  The Colour Purple were both superb - the first very polished, the latter very moving. Washington Square is wonderful for people watching, and dog watching, at the weekend. The New York Water Taxi is a great way to take a trip over to Brooklyn, ~$11 pp with excellent views of the Statue of Liberty)

<Content>Fab location We loved it here! It was a brilliant location just a block away from the Empire State Building and near the subway. The staff couldn't do enough for us.The room was perfect other than it was a twin bedded room rather than a double.We'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel at a great price and locaton  The Hotel Metro is great! The hotel room was spacious and very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The shower was one of the best I have ever used. The location is the best, only one block from Macy's and a few blocks from the Empire State Building. The subway is on the same block as the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel and will plan on going back there in the future.

<Content>Great location and free coffee! Friends recommended us to this hotel and we are so pleased they did. Friendly staff, clean rooms and a great location near the Empire State, Macy's, Time Sq and the Rockefeller Centre. The area immediately around the hotel wasn't great - lots of construction work so noise and dust but we always felt safe. The roof terrace was still closed for refurb although we saw little sign of any work going on. Our room overlooked the multi-storey car park so no view but clean and comfortable and the shower was wonderful! One small criticism is their strict rules over the mini-bar and fridge. We didn't put it to the test, but the info says that if you even lift something up to look at it for more than 20 seconds, it will be charged to your room! Our supplies weren't filled until the third or fourth day we were there and so we hadn't realised there should have been more chocolate and stuff. They tried to charge us but we refused and they were okay about it. You couldn't use the fridge to store any of your own drinks (even water) at all.The breakfast room got pretty full but it was a great not to have to go out to find breakfast. If anyone keeps kosher, there are two or three restaurants and a deli within a couple of blocks.

<Content>Not as good as everybody says... I, like many of you, before deciding which hotel to choose, tend to spend hours and hours on places like this finding the best hotel for the money. I read a lot of excellent reviews of this hotel and on the outside sources the hotel's website mention. So, even tough this hotel was a little more expensive than the others I was planning to choose, I decided to book this hotel based solely on the reviews I read. The hotel is not bad but it's not the wonder people tend to believe. It is located in a block surrounded by chinese/korean commerce (of course, not the kind of place like Chinatown) but just regular bars and hotels but with a an almost 99% asian clientele. The room size is good from a NYC point of view, but the bathrooms are tiny. The very first day I used the bathroom, one of the towels tray went off and it stayed there my whole stay. I didn't care for asking in the desk for its repair but the cleaning personal saw that tray broken every day and they didn't have the iniative to ask for its repair. The hotel staff is neutral, nor friendly, nor rude, except one day when the staff at the desk was rude and uninterested. The hotel is clean and the bed is confortable, the complimentary breakfast is a plus. But let me tell you that I didn't find this hotel nothing extraordinary nor charming and I doubt I'll be back again because I know there are equal or even better hotels with better prices than this one. Hotel Metro is not as good as they want you to believe.

<Content>Love this hotel!! Transform yourself into 'old Hollywood' in this beautiful, charming, not to mention economical for NYC coolest of hotels - not a chain with all the amenities of same - very special! Great location to so much. Cozy lounge - great martinis! We didn't want to leave! The staff are friendly, helpful and even fun. Our only regret was that the rooftop was closed for rennovations but from what we could see - what a view - feels as if you can reach out and touch the Empire State Bldg. Can't wait to go back for another stay!

<Content>Cute, but some problems The decor is charming, the free breakfasts are excellent, our room had a walk-in shower and the staff is surprisingly friendly and helpful for NYC. On the other hand, the neighborhood is a little creepy, esp. passing by the gauntlet of garbage piled high on the sidewalks every day and night. Don't be misled by all new plush top mattresses as I was - that apparently means nicer ticking, not pillow top. The bed was too hard for me. I awoke with back pain for the first time in many years. Minibar had only coca-cola and alcohol. Storing water, fruit, or juice prohibited with an electronic alarm to enforce it. Cheap plastic cups - no glasses. Superior queen sleeping room 10'x12', bath 4'x5', pretty small for 3.5* even in NYC. Roof deck closed.Maybe all one can expect for the price in NYC ($310 weeknight) but next time I will try somewhere a little more expensive.

<Content>Excellent Stay I stayed for a week on a business trip. The room was very clean and a little larger than I had expected for NYC. The room was very quiet from the outside noise,;didn't even realize I was in the city. The continental breakfast had more than just a bagel and muffin; it had fruit and yogurt as well. That was great!! Free interent was very nice. The staff was good.

<Content>Quirky with Great Geography If location's all you're after, this may be the hotel for you! The Hotel Metro is a half block from the subway and Harald Square/Macy's, and only a five minute walk from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. It has nice thick cotton towels and free internet access during specified hours in a key-carded room for which you must procure a pass from the front desk. That's where the good points end. My major gripe was that there was a strange rustling sound, that may have been a rodent in the wall, which woke me up all night in my room. At first I thought it was air conditioner condensate dripping, or the mini bar sensor, so I turned off the A/C and later unplugged the frig. The sound persisted and kept me from sleeping much for the two nights I spent there. There was no noise during the day. It was kind of creepy and unsettling. Room 710 was average size, about 16x12 with cutouts and a small bathroom with almost no counterspace and a bathtowel-sized floorspace. I was told I was being upgraded to a king, and I thought it was all talk, until I saw the tiny rooms with almost no walking space when the maids left doors open along the hallways. Furnishings and carpet were dingy gold, brown, orange, and the fake marbled bathroom had incongruous plastic cups and thick, comfy white cotton towels. The rooftop which everyone raves about was closed, there was heavy construction going on immediately to the west of the building, and that block of W. 35th is seedy and filthy. Location is ok, but it's overpriced for the amenities and questionable rodent problem. I only stayed there because I couldn't find a room at any 4 stars+ in the city that weekend due to multiple events.

<Content>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE The front desk staff was horrible...especially in the afternoon. The man (george) was extremely rude and unhelpful. If something happens to go missing in that hotel...good luck in getting anyone to help you find it. Totally ruined my trip. I would not reccommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>No problems, great location This was my first time booking a hotel in NYC. After reading lots of reviews for lots of hotels, some of which sounded scary, I opted for a relatively expensive, but safe bet. The Hotel Metro matched my expectations. There were no problems at all. I had a single room with a king size bed. It was small but comfortable. The amenities (bed, towels, toiletries, TV, etc.) were those of an average hotel like a Holiday Inn. The staff were professional but not particularly friendly or helpful. The location is really great, half a block from the subway at Herald Square, plus there are quite a few places to eat around the hotel, especially Korean food.

<Content>Good Hotel The Metro is very central. Empire State building, Macy`s very near and Penn Station and Time Square within easy walking distance and a subway station on the cornerWe found the hotel to be very clean (bed clothes changed every day). Staff friendly and helpful our room (601) overlooking an alley was a bit small. It was slightly noisy with extractor fans from nearby reataurants working all night. Our own air conditioning system worked well but was also rather niosy too. but we soon got used to it. The breakfast was better than we expected with a good choice and plentiful. Overall the Metro is a great hotel and we would recomend it to our friends and stay there again.

<Content>Excellent - Quiet and great location What a find. We picked the Metro on a wim out of the massive range of available accommodation in MidTown New YorkThe streets a little dingy but the hotel is a quiet and calm little oasis away from the noisy streets and bustle of the big city. The lounge is comfortable and the general decor theme is consistently smart throughout the whole hotel. The continetal breakfast is good value and the restaurant serves good value and well prepared meals each night.Bedrooms are comfortable and well maintained - though ours was a little cramped and next to a bulding siteA major selling point is the location - round the corner from Times Square, Macys, the Empire State Building and Fifth avenue

<Content>Fantastic hotel!!! I stayed at this hotel with my fiancee and brother for 5 nights in August 2006. To our delight we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment. This was our first visit to New York City and what a wonderful experience we had! The only small criticism I have is that the internet room was a little too hot but it was free to use the internet so that made up for it. The muffins we had for breakfast each morning were delicious! I highly recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel This is a wonderful hotel with a reasonable prices for New York City. It was very clean and well kept. The hotel staff were customer service oriented and went above and beyond to assist their customers. The location was accessible to subway and tourist transportation. I will definately stay there again. PAF

<Content>Great Hotel* Came back from NYC just now .....can't wait to write a review here for this great place...My mom and I arrived at around 2 in the morning ....the staff at night were efficient and took only 5 mins to check us in..I heart their 24 hour coffe/tea service...since there are no convinience store near the hotel..Didn't get to go on the sun deck since it was under construction during the time of our stay........Macys, victoria secert, forever21 etc are just 30 seconds away from the hotel ....and Korean town is just 2 blocks down (They got yummmy food)...Subway Stations are around the corner....highly recommand and would definitely stay there again....

<Content>Fantastic stay at Hotel Metro Stayed at the Hotel Metro for 4 nights on honeymoon at the end of March 2007.Great hotel-no complaints at all! Couldn't have asked for a better location, 2 minutes away from Macys and 10 minutes walk from Times Square-everywhere is easily accessible from the location.The hotel itself-we always found staff to be very efficient and helpful, the room was small but fine otherwise with decent shower in bathroom. We had requested a room at the back which was great as it was very quiet and we were able to get a good nights sleep every night!Breakfast was also fine, always plenty to choose from and the 24 hour coffee/tea facilities is a great idea.Overall would highly recommend the Hotel Metro for travellers on a budget but who don't want to make too many compromises!BTW-would also recommed the 2-day hop on-hop off bus tours which can be booked at reception-really resonable price and you get to see so much more of NY than you would on foot!

<Content>Great location, great breakfast My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Metro in late April, 2007. We loved it. We were initially put in a smoking room, but our request to change to a non-smoking room was immediately granted. The new room was very small but at least it didn't smell like smoke.The room we were in seemed to be recently renovated, the carpet was new and fluffy. The bathroom was marble. The shower was great - high pressure and no waiting for hot water.There is free high-speed wireless, and a safe. While we were there, our clock radio was switched out to one with mp3 hookup - nice touch! Too bad I didn't bring my ipod.The best part was the location - near Macy's and the Empire State building. Very central regardless of where you want to spend your time in Manhattan. A subway stop is a few steps away.The continental breakfast was free, fresh, and good.Overall, I'd recommend this hotel, especially for the price.

<Content>Great Hotel Excellent location and the complementary buffet breakfast and 24hr availability of coffee and tea was a real bonus. Did some research on hotels in this area before booking, and this hotel did not disappoint. Its location is superb - 5 mins walk to Macy's and 20 mins walk to Times Square. Staff were friendly and the room was clean and relatively spacious (superior queen bed size) and came equipped with iron, hairdryer and safe . Not much of a view from the rear of the hotel but if you're not used to the constant hum of traffic all night long its probably the best side to be located. The roof terrace is currently being refurbished and the gym is well equipped. Tip: If you are travelling by road to reach JFK and you leave between 3.30 - 4.30 - rush hour, allow at least 2 hours to reach the airport!!.

<Content>our stay ... Location,Location, Location... couldn't have picked a better hotel location for a first vist to the big apple. With macys at the end of the road and empire states building around the block and a 10min walk to times square, you feel right in the thick of the action. Hotel rooms, as previous reviewers have stated, are fairly small but adequate and very clean. Our safe didnt work and reported to reception would of sent a man to repair but used receptions instead. Bathroom was tiny but again clean and adequate. Lifts were abit of a pain, we went week after easter so hotel was not to busy but still had to wait a few times so would imagine its a right pain in peak times!! Didnt get any noise in the room thought, I think we were on the back on the hotel, with a great view of a multistorey carpark, but wasnt there for the room view so didnt bother us. Was abit gutted as the roof top terrace was closed for repairs so missed out on that. :( I must mention the metros resturant next door. Excellant service and food and relativley cheap and hotel guests get a discount, bonus! One of the best things about the hotel however is the breakfasts. Great selection of bagels, bread, croissants with soft cheese spreads, jams , butter etc.. with tea, coffee and fruit juices too boot, and being a tea belly was grateful of the allday tea and coffee service.Sadly I have to mention the poor service from hotel reception. I found them quite rude at times and stopped asking for any advice from them, didnt spoil the stay but better service would have made it a great hotel instead of an above average one. Must try harder!.p.s please try a steak at brendans ( opposite hotel) truely great !!!

<Content>Fab Location and Great Breakfast! It was my first time to New York and I absolutely loved this hotel.The location is fantastic- within spitting distance of Macys and Times Square. The rooms are quite large and are very clean and comfortable. We had a nice bathroom and walk-in closet plus ironing facilities, mini bar and snack basket.The breakfast in the morning is one of the best bits- I can't believethey throw it in for free! Loads of fresh tasty muffins and bagels aswell as bread, spreads, pastries and cereals. The hotel also does comlpimentary tea and coffee all day long- another bonus!Another great feature of the hotel is its rooftop terrrace. Here you can enjoy the view of the city including Macy's and The Empire State Building. t's a great suntrap and they even open up a bar at certain times of the day. Next to it is the indoor gym and there is also a handy drinks vending machine and ice machine.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic stay We boooked this hotel on the internet, something which is quite new to us (mature couple). We arrived and recieved a very warm welcome and were told that we had been given a room upgrade. The reception staff were really efficient, and when we mentioned we would like to go to a jazz club that evening, they offered to find out about some clubs for us and would check them out for price, availabillity etc. They said they would ring our room when they had details, this they did very quickly.We couldn't fault the room, it was great, spacious and very clean. The breakfast was plentiful the only thing which could have been a problem was the size of the lounge at peak times - but then you could have taken breakfast to your room. We didn't experience any difficulty.Oh and the coffee being available 24hrs a day was also great.All in all a great place to stay, we would certainly go back again.

<Content>I would be happy to stay there again We stayed at the Metro for 4 nights at the end of March in a superior room. We asked for non smoking but on arrival we were told the rooms were smoking, but were brand new and would not smell. They did. To be fair to the check in staff we were told in advance we could change but after a very long day we could not be bothered and decided we would leave the windows open. I regretted this after the first flush of the toilet which wouldn`t stop filling up and flooded the bathroom. Fortunately I found the stop valve and prevented it flooding the bedroom. One call to reception and staff were quickly on scene. No further problems. Whilst on the subject of the bathroom, it was TINY, the smallest I have encountered in any hotel. Anyone sat on the loo would be instantly kneecapped by another person opening the door.As previously mentioned in other postings the breakfast is a nice touch. The chocolate muffins are excellent but you need to grab them as soon as you go in otherwise someone else will. The breakfast room itself is not very big but has an informal atmosphere. The all day coffee/ tea was also very welcome.The hotel is in a good location for most things. I agree with previous posters about Heartlands brewery just around the corner, good choice of beer and food. Also worth a visit is the place directly across the road from the Hotel Metro, Brendans I think it was called. Reasonably priced and not too far too walk back ! No complaints about the staff, ther were friendly and informative but one observation. I asked for a quote for a taxi back to Newark airport and was told 90 dollars including tip. I had used Carmel from the incoming flight which was 60 dollars including tip.Reception staff had not heard of Carmel and suggested if I booked a company from the phone book they might not turn up ? I`m sure there are better hotels in New York but the Metro ticks most of the boxes and I would be happy to go there again.

<Content>Great Value for New York Stayed 2 nights April found the hotel to be very friendly. We arrived at 8.30am just expecting them to store our luggage which they did no problem but also told us to go ahead and have breakfast which is a very good extended buffet served in a lovely lounge The bedroom was clean but small and very noisy being at the front of the hotel. The safe did not work they did try to repair it but they do have safety boxes at reception no charge for them The friendly staff and breakfast make this hotel an ideal stay in New York not to mention the great location  We travelled from JFK to Penn Street by Airtrain and Metro from Howard Beach $7 each walked from Penn Street to hotel Metro

<Content>Not bad, free for all at breakfast time. A great position, near subway, Maceys etc - ideal for nipping back to whilst you are out and about. There is even coffee available 24 hours in the lobby area.The rooms were ok. Our's was on the 12th floor and a little pokey and 1980's but lets face it you're hardly in the room at all. The staff were ok, cannot say much about them as had little contact. . My only warning to you is watch out at breakfast time. Peak breakfast time was about 8-9am and there were not enough chairs, people were standing to eat their crunchy nuts - bizzare! We were there at peak time - Easter, but still. In fairness though, a clean and well run hotel. All in all pretty much what you would expect for your money. The city itself however! Fantastic.... Book Up!! Happy Holidays.

<Content>Worth every penny!! We stayed here because we were going to a late night birthday party. I had read many of the previous reviews and was still pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The front desk was well staffed and helpful. Complimentary coffee and tea are offered throughout the day. We arrived around 4pm and decided to go shopping. Talk about a perfect location! Herald Square is less than a block away. Our room was small, but very clean and pleasant with a view of the rooftops out back. The minibar is charged based on the weight of items. Do not remove anything unless you expect to be charged for that item. Aside from the basic cleanliness and convenience of this location, we were surprised at the quality of the food in the Metro Grill. My husband and I had a wonderful dinner! The atmosphere leaves something to be desired, but the Ravioli Aurora and the Salmon were both excellent!Lots of value in this location!

<Content>Great Location, Unfriendly Staff! My Fiance and I love New York. It's an amazing city. We booked The Hotel Metro as an extra holiday for this year so were on a bit of a budget. The hotel is good value for it's location but, trust me, you get what you pay for!The hotel isn't so bad itself but the staff were very unhelpful and even borderline rude at times! I don't know what was eating them but it got to the stage where I couldn't be bothered to ask them anything! There was no heating in our room and they kept saying they would fix it but it never happened! Bare in mind it was the big freeze when we went.....-10!!The rooms are not bad and they were quite big for New York. We had no street noise which we always expect from New York. It was a nice quiet, comfortable room in fainess. The bathroom could do with updating. The location was brilliant! It is very easy to get around as the Subway in just at the end of the block as well as Macy's!Overall, we got what we paid for but the staff could have been more friendly! We would not stay here again or make the mistake of going budget when we go back to New York. I must admit I am the sort of person who likes to stay in a nice hotel, even if I'm not going to be in it that much. If you are the sort of person who doesn't mind then it's perfect. I couldn't help thinking......for another 拢200 we could've stayed at the Waldorf again. I wish we had paid it as it would have made our holiday another perfect one in New York.

<Content>Nice stay 13-21 March First thing first the staff were very friendly especially one of the doormen who recommended the show Curtains (an older gentleman and unfortunately I can't recall his name). The show was brillinat by the way. On our first night we were allocated a room on the top floor but were woken at 8am the next morning by the builders working on the terrace. Once we informed the reception staff we were moved to another room. Might want to question whether the works are completed on the terrace before accepting a room on the 12th floor. The whole hotel including our room was spotless. Another bonus when staying at the Metro is the free breakfast. Bagels, toast, muffins, fruit, juice, tea, coffee and so forth were all yummy and more than enough to do you for the day. You could also take breakfast up to the room if you fancy breakfast in bed (breakfast staff will happily organise a tray for you). It might be a bit repetitive to have breakfast in the hotel each day but it can save you a fortune.Great location as many people have described. Nearest metro stop is 100 yards away 34th St/Herald Square. I would recommend Brendans bar across the street from the hotel. Nice bar with a great atmosphere (hotel bar was nice but usually empty). Free wifi in the room - absolutely brilliant especially those like me who can't live without their laptop. The hotel room also has a laptop sized safe which even my wide screen laptop could fit into. Overall it was a nice hotel and I would stay here again. I have recommended this hotel to family and friends too.

<Content>Excellent Location The hotel is an excellent location - particularly for a first time visit. macy's is directly across the road at the end of the block and the Empire State Building is one block over. There is also a handy metro station at the end of the street.The breakfast is complementary - bagels and muffins - good quality.There is a roof top restaurant but it was not open in March. The room we had was at the back of the hotel and slightly on the small side but there was very little street noise and it was very clean.Staff were helpful and there is a half hour free internet facility on the second floor ask at reception for a key to access the internet room.Overall a very good hotel.

<Content>Great Find!! I just returned from a first time trip to NYC and I have to rave about our hotel. The Hotel Metro was an excellent choice for a first-timer in the city. The location was excellent ... right around the corner from the Empire State Building, a short walk from Herald Square where one can find Macy's, Sephora, Victoria's Secret and tons of other stores. Half a street block away from a subway station that connects with all the major lines that can take you almost anywhere very quickly. The room itself was quite spacious and we had a great view of the Empire State Building. The continental breakfast was perfect to fill up on before a day out in the city. Lots to choose from and plenty of room to sit and enjoy it. The staff was friendly and always available to hail a cab or give a suggestion as to where to eat or what to see.I would recommmend this hotel to anybody who is a first time visitor and is overwhelmed with all the choices out there.

<Content>Quiet hotel in great location Staying at the Metro was a highlight of my recent five-night trip to New York. I was there during an unusual spring snowstorm. However, the location of the Metro was perfect. It was near the Empire State Building and within walking distance of the theater district. The hotel had a wonderful breakfast every morning, which kept overall expenses low. I requested a quiet room on an upper floor. My room was larger than I expected with a roomy closet. It was very clean and quiet. I look forward to going back.

<Content>What a surprise! I stayed at the Hotel Metro along with 6 friends for a 5 night stay shopping and taking in all the sights. The hotel was functional and all that we really needed for a long weekend. The room was small (no view) but clean. The breakfast adequate. The 24hr complimentary tea/coffee facilities were very useful especially as a 'pitstop' during frantic shopping sprees!. The lounge was a welcome retreat to rest tired feet also!.At first, when we arrived in the city after a long and tiring journey from London, I was not entirely sure where we were situated - so a visit to the rooftop terrace proved to be a wonderful surprise!. The Empire State Building is so close you feel you can almost touch it!. Talk about a great photo opportunity!. It's just one of the experiences I shall never forget from my wonderful trip to New York.I would stay at the Hotel Metro again for it's convenient (and breathtaking) location.

<Content>Great Hotel, Wonderful Location........ Had a great time in NYC  Hotel Metro helped along the way. We were upgraded to a kingsize room without asking, 8th floor at the back of hotel, great room. Had a bath plus shower, loads of floor space  walk in wardrobe. No trouble with street noise.Breakfast was heaven, great chioce, never overcrowded and always plenty to eat. Coffee on tap 24/7, great to take to your room. All staff very friendly  helpful. Had a slight problem with our room safe, this was sorted within 10 minutes to our complete satisfaction.Great location, 5 minutes walk to Empire State, 15 minutes to Times Square, 30 minutes Central Park - wonderful.Try Heartland Brewery at bottom of Empire State - great home brew beers  ciders. Tavern on the Green in Central park does a mean Lemon Martini.Irish Pub the Playwright next to Hotel is nice  friendly  burgers are wonderful.Can recommend the Oyster Bar at Grand Central Terminal - lovely food.Matthew the door man, very polite  arranges your taxi to the airport in good time to check in.

<Content>Nice hotel....good breakfast! After reviewing many hotels on this site, I ended up choosing the Metro for a 4 night trip to NYC with my mom and cousin. I mainly chose this for the location and for the fact that a breakfast was included. It was very nice to have the continental breakfast as an option in the mornings, and saved us from having to buy breakfast or coffee elsewhere. The 24 hr. coffee/tea service in the lobby was a nice touch as well.The location of the hotel was awesome. It was a quick walk to the next block for both Macy's and the Empire State Bldg. We usually took a cab everywhere else because the weather was so cold while we were there. A cab ride to Times Square was about 6 dollars and approx. 5-10 minutes depending on traffic. Also about the same $ and time for a cab to any of the theatres.Overall, the hotel was a good value by NYC standards. Our room happened to be a wheelchair-accessible room, so it was obviously larger than what the normal room size would be. Therefore, the three of us had plenty of space in a room with two double beds. I can't comment on the space issue in the average room. We were located (I think) on the back of the hotel, and there was no view at all from our window. But it didn't matter because we truly weren't in the room long enough anyway. Who wants to hang out in their hotel while in NYC??We did have a couple of minor problems with our room though that I should comment on. Our toilet continued to malfunction and we had to have maintenance there several times. Also the battery on our door lock started to go dead in the middle of the night (which resulted in a constant low beeping noise from 2 AM until we left the room at 9 AM). Apparently the front desk person was unable to change the battery and maintenance had to be contacted for this problem. This was a bit irritating to us, and the front desk wasn't very accomodating. Overall, the staff wasn't very helpful and/or friendly (with the exception of one bellman--an older gentleman and unfortunately I can't recall his name).So in summary, I would recommend this hotel for price, location, breakfast/coffee---but hopefully you won't have problems that require assistance from the front desk staff. Have fun in the city!!!

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great Location Stayed at the Hotel Metro last July on a business trip. Room was very spacious and clean; bathroom was clean as well (a bit dated looking, but still clean). Gym facilities were OK - just used the treadmill and it was fine. Loved the upper deck for cocktails in the evening! Staff was friendly and helpful. There were lots of good choices for Breakfast and the room it was served in was large and comfortable with TV's all around to catch up on the morning news.Location was great! So many destinations within walking distance...couldn't have asked for better.I would definitely recommend this hotel for both business and pleasure travel. Looking forward to another stay at the Hotel Metro.

<Content>Not as great as it used to be We used to love this hotel, but the rooms have gotten smaller and the terrific free refrigerators have been replaced by prestocked bars that very sensitive to touch so it is easy to get an extra charge on your bill. Not a bad hotel for the money, but not as great as it used to be. Has a nice roof garden with a view of the Empire State Building and most of the people are fairly friendly.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Hotel Metro for our honeymoon over New Year 2003-2004. The hotel has a wonderful location very close to Macys and The Empire State Building. We were slightly disappointed with the actual room - it certainly wasn't what you'd imagine your honeymoon suite to look like (!) but it was clean and did the job! The staff were very helpful and friendly - particularly after our luggage went missing for 36 hours at the airport.The negatives were that we were on the floor below the gym so could hear people running on the treadmill. Also we had absolutely no view from our room. And the free breakfast wasn't up to much, but then it was free and we didn't have to eat it!

<Content>Some good  The Good:- got a special discount when booked on-line- clean room- nice bathroom and hot water- good bagels for breakfast- helpful staff- central Manhattan locationThe Bad:- smaller room than shown on website (I hate that!)- noise from front street (windows not soundproof at all!)I would not stay in a front room on the weekend due to the street noise. The weeknights were better. Overall I might try them again but would be tempted to try another hotel in a different location (either Greenwich, Soho).

<Content>Hotel Metro a real find A lovely stay. Kind people at the desk. A surprisingly nice continental breakfast. My room was quite large. As a single traveler I'm often given a closet. Small bathroom but perfectly nice. I'd stay here in a minute. As there was a lot of snow on the roof and repairs were underway, the amazing roof deck was closed. I peeked out and wasn't prepared for the stunning view of the Empire State Building! For the on-line price you can't beat it.

<Content>Fantastic Location Having booked on line, we were not too sure what to expect , but were pleasntly surprised. Beautiful decor(very NYC)and the view from the roof top bar at night was jawdropping.We (my sister and I) had asked for 2 beds,but were given a double bed -we were told that a request does not automatically guarnatee what you asked for and it was not the hotel at fault , but the booking agent ! After a few minutes of debating we decided that we were in NY so why worry..The location of the hotel was perfect ( Macy's to the right, Empire State Building to the left).The staff were nothing but courteous and helpful and the hotel was spotless.The showers were hot and the bathroom clean.Rooms were clean and fresh and had a safe at no extra cost. Free tea  coffee at any time and a decent breakfast to set up eager tourists for the day.Loved NYC which was helped by the fact that the Metro Hotel was more or less perfect!!!I will be back.....Jackie Ryan, Galway ,Ireland

<Content>Shopping  I stayed at the Metro Hotel for 5 days with two other female friends from the 1st to the 5th Feb 2007. The hotel is near all the beautiful Manhattan shops and accessable to all the tourist attractictions. The Staff are wonderful and helpful especially George. The hotel is clean and the rooms are large ( we where given a free uprgade to a suite!!...loved it).The breakfast is to die for...you wiill die after stuffing your face with all the muffins...an food on offer.I cannot rate this hotel enough...a 10 out of 10.I am back in NYC in July with my 3 year old and i know where i will be staying...Yes....the Metro again ..if they will have me back.Only joking they loved me and my friends....even when we came back from clubbing at 5am in the morning!Check it outRegardsAllyson

<Content>Really pleased with chose the Metro I stayed at the Metro in New York last October and I鈥檓 afraid it鈥檚 taken me all this time to do this review. However, I did particularly want to do this review as my husband and I were so pleased that we chose the Metro. We didn鈥檛 know where to stay but our friends from Washington recommended the Metro. We were particularly pleased with it鈥檚 location, being very central, surrounded by lots of shops, within a few yards of the metro station and within walking distance of Penn Railway Station, which we needed as we were travelling onwards to Washington. The one down point was the lack of medium range restaurants in locality. We arrived in the evening and wanted to have a meal but all the restaurants nearby were fast food, serving mainly pizzas, hamburgers, hot dogs etc. We couldn鈥檛 find a decent reasonably priced restaurant in the area at all. Maybe someone else will be able to recommend one but we walked around for at least an hour and could find nothing. We ended up eating at the Metro Hotel restaurant which was good but it would have been nice to have a choice. We did find in most areas of the City that there were plenty of cheap fast food restaurants and also very expensive restaurants but a lack of medium range restaurants. I鈥檓 sure they are there tucked away in side streets but we walked a lot and didn鈥檛 see many. We stayed in a basic room with no upgrade and were really pleased with it. It was a little on the small size but what you would expect for the price we were paying in a major city. Everything was very clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom had a bath as well as a shower. The free Broadband was good and really fast. It saved us a lot on phone calls as we could E Mail our friends in Washington when to expect us etc. However, the biggest bonus was the breakfast. Our room price included Continental breakfast and we were expecting just tea/coffee and pastries but there was a really good selection, including large selection of bread/bagels, cereals, boiled eggs, cheeses, yogurts, muffins, selection of teas, coffee, hot chocolate. I have probably left things out as it鈥檚 hard to remember everything. There may have been cold meats but I wouldn鈥檛 have noticed, being a vegetarian. My only complaint would be that it was served with the usual plastic cutlery and paper plates that we found in many establishments in New York, however, I鈥檓 probably just being fussy, being used to standards in the UK. As it was winter we could not use the rooftop bar but I鈥檓 sure that would be really nice in the summer. So all in all, I would thoroughly recommend the Metro for a short city break in a central location.

<Content>Great hotel. Just returned from a 6 night stay at the Metro and was very impressed with it. The location is excellent being very central and close to Maceys, the Empire State Building and a subway station. I loved the art deco styling in reception and in the rooms. Our room was big enough, it had a large TV and a good bathroom with Gilchrist and Soames toiletries. I asked for a high floor and was put in a room on the 6th floor - it was at the back of the hotel so no view but no traffic noise either.We had a few problems with the safe which refused to open but once the maintenance man realised it was actually faulty and the problem didn't lie with our inability to work it, he quickly fitted a new door to it.Minor gripes were lack of coathangers and lack of shelf space in the bathroom.The free breakfast was fine I thought although my husband was disappointed there was no option for a cooked breakfast. I didn't like the disposable cutlery and crockery though - that's not helping the global warming situation!Once we checked out, the doorman was happy to store our cases and book us a taxi to the airport.Finally I must recommend Brendan's Bar and Grill across the street for excellent food at reasonable prices in a lovely setting which you would not expect from the outside.

<Content>Good value Stayed here for Christmas 2006. Have been in NYC a few times, and we really enjoyed this hotel. Nice and very clean room with a view. Excellent location in Midtown. Maybe not as cool as Hotel QT, where we've also stayed, but Metro is on the other hand not as expensive. Free internet access and breakfast was also nice. If you'r looking for good value in Midtown, this is the place to go.

<Content>Great Hotel We just got back to the UK from an excellent 5 night stay at the Hotel Metro, W35th St, NY, arranged through Virgin Atlantic Holidays. The hotel was in a really good position half a block from Herald Square and Macy's. It was very clean and comfortable and the staff - including the room maids - were helpful, friendly and polite. Our room was large, the double bed comfortable, the good sized bathroom clean with a good shower, and the large TV (with satellite) actually worked (unlike some in other NY hotels we've stayed at previously!). There was also a mini-bar (though we didn't use it) and the heating wasn't opressive (and we could open the window). The only down side was the street noise at night (especially with the window open!) which sounded as if there was construction/rubbish collection going on all night every night - but we had been given a choice of room and chose front which probably wasn't too smart!There was free coffee available all day in the lounge (which you could take up to your room if you wanted) and a really great free breakfast - coffee, juice, fresh fruit, muffins, bagels, toast, pastries, yoghurts, cereals - you name it, everything you could possibly want short of a full cooked menu! Altogether a really great little hotel in an excellent, mid-town position, close to all the sights and convenient if you want to shop til you drop! We can thoroughly recommend it - the only thing making it fall short of an Excellent rating was the street noise at night but apart from that we couldn't fault it and would certainly stay there again.(Oh, and the Virgin flights were great too!)

<Content>Relaxing Hotel in great location We found the Hotel Metro to be very comfortable and relaxing - it is in a great location just around the corner from Macy's and a short walk to Times Square - 10 - 15 mins. We could see the Empire State building from our room. We had a family suite - two bedroomed with bathroom which was ideal for my husband  I and our son. It felt spacious - nice large windows and fairly high ceilings. The complimentary breakfast was very nice and it was good to be able to get tea and coffee at anytime of day - you just help yourself in the room where breakfast is served. We would definitely stay at the Hotel Metro again.

<Content>Great Loacation Just the most fantastic location, out of the hotel turn right 500 metres down the street and Macy's is right infront of you, Turn left 500 metres down the st and your on 5th Avenue - this hotel cannot be any better placed.Hotel is lovely, staff nice and breakfast filling. The rooms are of good standard, if you have the luxury of staying on a high or top floor you can see the empire state building in your view. The decor is a little dated but not as bad as some hotels in NY.Would definitely recommend especially for those first timers in NY.

<Content>Juat what we wnted 5 night stay - from Newcastle upon TyneMy only previous NYC trip had been a prize with a stay at The Waldorf so it was with some trepidation that my wife and I turned up at Hotel Metro.I should not have been concerned.Apart from the fact that the front rooms are noisy (ear plugs anadvantage) nothing else turned out to be any concern.Staff were pleasant and polite, complimentary breakfasts were smashing and the location was spot on - 100 yards from 34th St/Herald Square.We went for a twin room and this may be worthy of consideration for the extra space in the bedroom.Use the weekly Metro Ticket at $24 to get around. Once you master the subway it is far cheaper than the taxi option when you are likely to be at Central Park and Soho etc in the same day!One tip - avoid the offer of a bus to the airport and rely on a taxi - at least the taxi will not have additional stops en route to JFK!

<Content>Bed linens weren't 100% cotton Good value for a family. Only real complaint was the bed linens were not 100% cotton. They were a 60/40 poly blend which drives me bonkers as did the polyester blanket/cover. All that static - ugh.

<Content>Good room. Excellent breakfast. Awesome location. Love NYC! ***My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Metro for 13 nights over Thanksgiving into the start of the Christmas rush. What a fabulous time to be in New York City (NYC), a must do!!! Lots of lights and beautiful Christmas displays everywhere, this is an opportunity for kids to really enjoy the season and adults to relive their childhood!***To the room, it was a good size with adaquate storage. The room had a laptop safe with room for other valuables as well. The washroom was a bit small but nothing we couldn't work with. ***Room service was quick when we asked for extras. We never ordered food or ate in the hotel restaurant as there are alot of dining choices around the hotel including lil Korea which is just two blocks over. We even got a few work outs in the hotel gym.*** To avoid the noise from the street, we requested a room on a higher floor near the back of the hotel. In saying this, we would use our earplugs again as noisy car horns and garbage trucks rumbling through are just part of the ambiance in NYC. *** We started each morning with a healthy serving of tasty and healthy breakfast delights in the lounge which was included in the room charge. The staff were prepared with enough food and seating to fit everyone even during days when there were big events such as Black Friday and the Macy's Day Parade. ***The hotel is centrally located to local attractions and there is a subway station 1/2 a block away. Macy's is 1/2 block away, the Empire State Building is 1 block away and Time Square is only a 10 minute walk while the uptown attractions like Central Park, Trump Tower etc are about a 25 minute walk away. ***We will book again at the Hotel Metro. Thank you to all of those who had taken the time to share their experiences on Tripadvisor.***NYC is a must see destination and very friendly city, but be prepared to open up your wallet from the time you get off the plane until you are back on the plane. It is worth everyone penny!***Thanks Tripadvisor.

<Content>Nice Place We stayed at Hotel Metro in April 2006. We loved it. It was clean, the staff was friendly and the free breakfast was even decent.The rooms are small, but clean. High speed Internet was faster than dial-up, but not by much. But it worked.The room was small, but that's expected in NYC, especially in a moderately price hotel.Very clean and the bathroom was nice. So were the toiletries that were provided.Near the Empire State Building and subway stations.We would definitely stay here again. In fact, we are visiting NYC again in May 2007, and tried to book at Hotel Metro, but it was sold out!I would defintiely stay at Hotel Metro again.

<Content>never again Stayed 3 nights at the Metro.We got a newly renovated room with two beds. It was small but clean. They offer a nice free breakfast. Location is nice, Macy's is just around the corner and subway is only a few steps away.Sounds like a perfect place?NO!The rooms facing the street are a nightmare because it was extremely loud as the windows have no soundproofing and most of the window seals are gone!You feel like standing in the middle of the street. It is a very busy street and you will be awake every nigth for up to 3-4 hrs because of the garbage collection! Scores and scores of bags cover the sidewalks every night and it takes time to collect all.The front-desk staff is extremly rude and lied to beat the band!They also refused to give us an other room.I will never stay here again!Be careful, this place could ruin your stay in NYC if you get on of the rooms facing the street.

<Content>Hit and Miss I was staying at the Hotel Metro for business, so a good night's sleep was key. Unfortunately, I stayed there during an unusually warm weekend in December. They had shut the air conditioning off for the season, and all I could get out of the unit in my room was hot air--not even air from the outside. I'd estimate the temperature in my room reached about 90 degrees by bedtime. After several desperate phone calls to the front desk between midnight and 1am, someome finally came up and opened my bedroom window. But, I STILL wasn't able to sleep because of all of the street noise. The manager was very helpful the next day, and they did manage to find a room for me at the back of the hotel, where the fan did actually blow air from the outside. But, the first night was miserable. The rooms were average for New York, small and a little bit shabby. The breakfast was wonderful, though they could use more seating, and the location was terrific for my purposes. But, I would not stay again.

<Content>Great! We stayed at the Hotel Metro between 19th and 23rd December and had a great time. After reading the reviews here we asked for a room on one of the higher floors and we were given a room on the 9th floor which was very quiet. Clean, comfortable room, no bath but that didn't matter. Hotel staff were very helpful, gave us maps of New York and advised us about trains etcThe free 24hr coffee is very welcome, breakfast great. We'd told the hotel we were in New York to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary and champagne and chocolates were waiting for us in our room when we arrived.We had a wonderful time in New York and would stay here again!

<Content>Not the best value in Midtown We stayed at this hotel in December 2006 and found it to be a very average hotel room for midtown. It was extremely loud as the windows are not very soundproof and there seemed to be construction or something going on outside until 3AM. We have stayed at two other hotels in midtown for the same price and they were both much more modern, cleaner and had larger rooms. With that all said, there were no major dissapointments with this hotel - the breakfast was good, service was great and the location is indeed very good. The area is safe and there is a subway one block away. Overall, decent hotel but there is better value to be found in midtown.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Fantastic Location My wife and I stayed here the weekend before Christmas, The Most Wonderful Time of the Year, which means it's the most crowded. While in a busy part of town - just a block from Macy's - the quiet seclusion of the Hotel Metro made a nice escape from our otherwise touristy weekend. We flew into JFK, took the Airtrain to Jamaica Station and the Long Island Railroad to Penn Station. This was the most economical means I could find to travel into the city ($10 per person at the non-peak time). We walked from Penn Station - which was no problem. Taking cab here could be a problem as things always seemed kind of jammed around the nearby intersections. There is also a subway stop at the 6th Ave end of the block but we actually never used it. The desk had our check-in information almost instantaneously after we arrived, even though the desk attendant was simultaneously assisting another guest with some show reservations.The room was adequately sized and very clean. It was apparent that they had gutted and older hotel at some point recently as everything had a kind of new clean feel to it. The bathroom had some nice products. No view to speak of - but we hadn't come here to stay in the room. It was very quiet in the mornings - we were on the side away from the street. The free breakfast is filling and a good starter. The free wireless internet is a great help! The rooftop terrace was closed for renovations - but I'm sure it's awesome as the Empire State Building Towers over the whole area.It's only one subway stop to Times Square, so we walked there as well - about 15 minutes - up Broadway. Saw a show at the Marquis Theater (The Drowsy Chaperone) - the ticket gave you a free pass to The View Lounge, which is usually $7. You'll need that to spring for the $15 cocktails. But it's a rotating restaurant / lounge ringed at the window by tables for 2 - so a great place for a date. We walked up 5th Avenue to Rockefeller Center and did The Top of the Rock - this was a much better experience than the Empire State Building, which I did a year ago. I was kind of shocked by the disparity between the massive crowd around the ice rink and tree and how empty / spacious it was at the top. I guess this secret isn't out yet!For all of our activities, the Hotel Metro provided and excellent base as we wanted to check out things from Central Park to Canal Street's shady shopping. It was a little pricey - but so was everything for this time of year. Overall, we had a great stay and I would stay here again.

<Content>Great Location -- One Room, Four People I needed a hotel room that had a bedroom with a bed and another room with 2 beds. We booked a suite that had a bedroom and 2 beds in the living room instead of a sofa. The room with the two beds was right next to the hotel's red neon sign giving the room a film noir feel. Could have benefited from heavier blackout curtains. And the garbage pickup was around 2am.But as this affected my kids and not the adults -- who cares! No seriously, I would ask for a room that didn't front the street -- was busy. Beyond that, the room was very nice and suited the task at hand -- college visit perfectly. Had a sink outside of the bathroom which was helpful in getting the 4 of us out and about.The breakfast buffet was good too. We went up on the roof to take pictures of the empire state building at night -- very nice.We paid $239/night and haven't seen a price like that since. We would go back if we did.

<Content>Best Hotel in Midtown This is a great hotel!!! If you want the best place in midtown, this is your place. The rooms are nice, there is a great breakfast included. Be sure to talk to a doorman named Matthew. He is a native new yorker with all the best advice. A really great guy! The subway is right by the hotel and can take you anywhere. Be sure to buy the 1 day fun pass for $7 instead of $2 a trip. The location was perfect for anywhere you want to go. I would stay here again and again.

<Content>Excellent Location Excellent Location 100 meters from Macey's and 34th street metro. 2 minutes from Empire State.Very good breakfast. Rooms very nice and friendly staff.Same street as few nice pubs/restaurants. Also try Jack Dempseys on side of Empire State for food.We are VERY picky when it comes to staying in places and this was very good - comfortable and easy. Spent a week looking for hotels and reading reviews.

<Content>Great location! We had transport booked from the airport to the hotel which was a good start. On arriving at the hotel the desk staff were helpful. The room was a good size and the bathroom was good too, plus plenty of nice toiletries provided everyday. The hotel was in the best location, one street from the Empire State Building and the hotel had a roof terrace which in the evening had the most amazing view of the ESB all lit up. We walked absolutely everywhere, we did not use any public transport and whilst our feet were in agony it was soo worth it as you didn't miss anything when we went places. Plus as it was in the middle of everything you could walk either right down to battery park or up to central park etc.. Was also close enough to Times Square for the evening. The breakfast was probably the only part which wasn't brilliant but it was ok, there were huge muffins and danish pastries, though if you came back in about 11 am you could have round two if you liked! or at least another coffee or fruit juice. The metro restaurant which was adjoined was really lovely and the food here was fab, we ended up eating here every night as it was so good. We booked a trip with the hotel to go on an evening boat trip around Manhattan and I would say this was the best part of the holiday, seeing lit up Manhattan at night going under Brooklyn Bridge etc it was amazing and we were lucky enough to also see a firework display on that trip which was fantastic.As to New York, get to the ESB at about 8am on a week day and you won't have to queue at all and it's worth doing the option with the speaker so you get stories as you go around the top. The views were brilliant. We went to Liberty Island in the afternoon, it was good though she's not as big as I imagined! You will have to queue to get on the boat, we didn't get off at Ellis Island but if you want to, go early as you will be queuing a long time to get back on the boat from here as it picks up the Liberty Island Trippers first and then the people from Ellis just fit in any space that is left. If you want to go up the pedestal of Liberty you have to phone to pre book or there are a limited amount of tickets on the day, though I don't think we missed much by not going inside it. Grand Central Terminal is worth a trip, even if it's just to grab something to eat, the food court downstairs is massive as are the huge sandwiches!If you want tickets from the cheap TKTS booth for Broadway shows, we went to the less crowded one down the bottom end of the island, however there wasn't much left by the time we got there so I'd recommend getting there when it opens.We were not planning on passing ground zero, however it is difficult to miss but actually does make you think and you may wish to stop by to pay respect.Also I think next time we will arrange to have one of those trips with a real New Yorker, but you have to book well in advance.I would definitely stay at this hotel again (also about the hotel there is a safe in the room which is also a bonus).

<Content>Great littel hotel, great location I'm so glad I trusted the Trip Advisor reviews--this hotel is a gem. We decided rather last minute to take a Thanksgiving weekend trip to New York, so I was pleasantly surprised to be able to find a hotel in a great location at such a reasonable price for NYC ($220/nite for a regular double). The rooms wasn't huge by US standards, but was very well-maintained, smartly appointed, comfortable and, above all, clean! The continental breakfast that's included is a big plus--a wide selection of fruit, cereal, bagels, pastries, yogurt, cheese, juices--more than enough to give you a great start on the day. And the lounge remains open with coffee and tea available 24 hours.The location is great. On a relatively quiet street just a block from Herald Square and easy walking distance to all Midtown attractions. The doorman gave great tips and directions.The only funkiness is the minibar system, which is on a sensor and registers anything that's moved. But at checkout we were aksed what we used, and everything else was taken off with no hassle at all.A very pleasant experience--would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone.

<Content>Fab Hotel First time in New York and we stayed at the Hotel Metro. Really centralised and from our room we could see Macy's. The room was a decent size and clean although the bathroom was a bit on the small side. There isn't any tea/coffee facilities in the room although you can get tea/coffee from the dining area 24 hrs a day. The breakfast is good: cereals, toast, muffins, croissants etc - enough to keep you going. Very comfortable dining area with two televisions. The staff at the hotel are very pleasant and helpful. They are happy to help you with working out the subway stops and recommending restaurants - try Phinos Italian restaurant - it's great! Unfortunately the rooftop terrace was closed for repairs so we didn't get to go up there which was a shame. We throughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay again. It's situated in a great place close to the shops and the Empire State Building. It's about a 15-20 min walk to the Rockefeller Centre and Times Square. We would definitely recommend a stay here.

<Content>Thankyou Tripadvisor! We originally booked into another hotel nearby because others in our party were staying there but, having read its reviews on this site, contacted our travel agent to swap our booking to the Metro. Admittedly it cost a little more than our original one but it was well worth the extra. The hotel staff were efficient and friendly, the rooms were very comfortable and we loved the Art Deco decor. The breakfast is great if you can resist doing the true american pancakes experience (which we only managed twice during our stay!). Having seen the rooms where others in our party were staying, we definitely made the right choice.Its also worth noting that the hotel will arrange airport transfers for you if you need them.There's also a great Irish bar a few doors down which had a great atmosphere.

<Content>Fantastic Location at reasonable price (for New York) Excellent location in Mid Manhattan. Staff very helpful and friendly. We had a delux room which was quite large with two beds, although the bathroom was very small (but you dont spend much time in there). Breakfast was fantasic with a really good choice of bagels, cereals, pastries, Muffins, toast and yogurts, enough to set you up for a day of sightseeing. The roof top terrace is well worth a look, although it can be a little cool and windy. The hotel also has free internet access and a gym, although we didn't make any use of these facilities. I would definitley stay here again!

<Content>Loved It--Priced Out of It Today I stayed here annually during the first part of the decade and loved it. Location, location, location. During my first visit, the hotel was being renovated so my room rate was under $120! I am now priced out of the hotel. Agree with the other reviews on why they liked it--helpful staff, breakfast buffet, restaurant etc.  One suggestion to avoid the tiny rooms--ask for the doubles in the back of the hotel. My room was large, had a beautiful bath, and queen beds. In summary, if the price is agreeable, you will enjoy The Metro. For my last visit, I stayed at the Jolly Madison Towers on 38th.

<Content>Nice small hotel at a nice price Nice small hotel convenient to Macy's and all Midtown Manhattan. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed. The beds were comfortable and had nice linens on them. The bathroom was small, but had a nice size shower. Great toiletries. The staff was friendly. There was a nice bar accross the street (Brendan's) and the Hotel Metro Cafe was good. The free continental breakfast was a plus! I would stay here again.

<Content>No sacrificing comfort for cost here!! Excellent value last minute booking for a Sunday night. Expected that we would have to make some sacrifices for the standard of room but was pleasantly surprised. Large rooms and very clean. Could not fault the room or facilities provided.All staff very friendly on front desk and for help with luggage. Breakfast had good selection and relaxed comfy surroundings. Walking distance to great places to eat, theatres and bars as well as shopping and sightseeing. As two young female travellers felt safe returning at night in surrounding streets. Would stay here again!

<Content>Manhattan on the rocks... I'm still not used to the sticker price of Manhattan hotels. At over $350, this room (smaller that the size of my daughter's room) was hard to swallow. It was clean, had the essentials and appeared to have new bathroom fixtures. My room faced the street so it got a bit noisy at night with trash truck after truck making their stops. Location was excellent-close to TSqr or Broadway or Park Av. The continental bfast was included in the price, well ran and with the basic fare. It was convenient.Back to the room: a square with the mini bar on one side of the bed, a small table and the TV just sitting on another small dresser with barely space for 3 days of clothes. The bed was a full bed, a tiny small for my taste. Next to the hotel was a restaurant and a few others within 100 yards.I'm stil looking for the hotel in the Park Av. area but i gues I better get used to $$$$ and a small confinement.

<Content>Great Hotel that is central to everything ! My partner and I stayed at The Metro from Saturday 4th November 2006 to Wednesday 8th November 2006. We were celebrating our 13th anniversary and went to NYC to do some sight seeing and shopping.This was my first visit to NYC and my partner's second visit.We had a superior deluxe room (407) which was bigger than anticipated as we thought rooms in New York were typically small; this was not the case at The Metro. We got 2 five foot beds, a large TV, minibar, dresser, table, coffee table, chairs, walk in wardrobe, safe, iroining board with quality iron that does not ruin you favourite shirts. The furniture was all walnut inlay and had a tasteful art-deco theme with pictures reminiscent of the film metropolis.The bathroom was also large and airy with Marble and Travetine decor. There were no issues with the water pressure.Breafast (included) consisted of a large selection of continental food and beverages. The Staff were very helpful and not in your face.On several occasions we found the front of house staff very helpful and receptive when we needed advice on the best way to get to places in and around the city. They were consistently helpful and friendly throughout our stay. They even supplied an umbrella on our last day when it rained so we did not get wet on our last shopping spree.The hotel is particulary well located because it is central to Manhatten, with Macy's, the world's biggest Footlocker, Victoria's Secret's, The Empire State Building and a variety of good jewellers very close (0 to 2 blocks). Everything else is a very short trip by foot or cab. The Hotel Bar makes a mean Apple or Strawberry Martini - make sure you try one even if you don't stay here !We also ventured out of town to Woodbury Common for the shopping which is just a bus ride away from the port authority which is a short cab ride or walk from the hotel. Time square is a short walk away as well.Favourite eat out was the Blue Fin on Union Square, again, just a short cab trip away from this centrally located hotel.All round, The Metro represents excellent value for money if you are on business or pleasure that is very centrally located within Manhattan with very tasteful clean rooms with good facilities and helpful staff.I will definitely be returning to this hotel on my next visit to Manhattan; loved the hotel, loved the people, loved New York.

<Content>Good value and great location. We stayed at the Hotel Metro in Midtown,Manhattan for 3 nights at the end of September 2006.Our room was very quiet at the back of the hotel and it was a good size.The outlook from the bedroom windows was on to the rooftop of a neighbouring property, but what can you expect in a busy built up area like Manhattan?I researched a large number of hotels in New York before booking the Metro after I read in a newspaper that New York had overtaken London for room rates.I have to say that the Metro, by comparison with a lot of other hotels in New York,was good value for money.A good buffet breakfast was included in the price of the room and there was tea/coffee available 24 hours.The room facilities were good.It was clean and the bed was very comfortable.The staff were very friendly and helpful.The location of the hotel could not have been better for shopping/attractions.There was a subway station a short walk from the hotel.The best recommendation I could give is that if I was going back to New York then I would definitely stay at the Metro.

<Content>Great location, very friendly staff. I have just spent 5 days at the Hotel Metro with my 16 year old daugher and her friend. The location of the hotel was excellent for both sightseeing and shopping. We could walk everywhere we wanted to go. - Times Square 10 mins, 5th Avenue Shopping 15 mins, Empire State Building 2 mins! The room was very clean and had everything you could ask for, hairdryer, tv, minibar, iron and very comfortable beds. Breakfast was included and this was a great bonus as it meant we didn't have to look for somewhere to eat each morning. There was huge selection of muffins, bagels, cereals - in fact everything you could ask for. The hotel bar was very welcoming, food there was great too. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. I would recommend this hotel as an excellent choice for a short break. One tip though, ask for a room at the back of the hotel, ours was at the back and although there was no view, we also didn't have to listen to the traffic all night! I imagine rooms at the front could be a bit noisy.

<Content>Perfect for the occasion This hotel fitted the bill perfectly. Brilliant location, could not have asked for more. Quiet, clean and polite. Room size not huge but then we weren't booking the Plaza and it was to sleep in, not move into! Good breakfast and open from 6.30 til 11 which is great (although gets very busy at certain times) and 24 hour tea and coffee. We were there to see the sights, and this hotel made that really easy. The front desk were really helpful when it came to leaving for the airport. The only annoying thing was we tended to break our day by returning to the hotel and they stripped the rooms in the morning and serviced in the afternoon so the beds werent remade when we came back. However, we never asked for it to be done and the maid said we could specify a time at the front desk if we wished so our own fault really. I knew that NY hotels were really pricey for what you get but this hotel I thought was perfect value for money, not a feeling I get often from hotels! We were lucky as we saw this on Trip Advisor and Virgin were having a deal at the time we went so this added to the value.

<Content>Not outstanding, but location is excellent Nothing outstanding, but fine overall. The location is excellent, and the room is tiny, but clean and quiet. The breakfast buffet is fine as well - not outstanding, not terrible. Service is brusque; this was one area that I felt could be improved. Overall, for the price (I paid around $300.night for a weekend in October) it's a good value, because of the location. It's difficult to find something in NYC that's any cheaper and also in a decent location.

<Content>What I Expected The Metro was the first stop on a 4-city tour I arranged and booked myself. Booked the Metro on the basis of TA reviews and therefore had a good idea what to expect.As stated many times - its biggest plus is its location and its biggest minus is the size of some of the bedrooms. If moving around space is important to you, don't stay here. We had a king room which looked out into the building well, so it was always gloomy in the room. However, it also meant it was quiet as we could hear no street noise apart from sirens.The breakfasts are great. We found them substantial enough to see us through the day but ideal if your idea of breakfast is a coffee and croissant.Although the room and bathroom are small I had everything I wanted to hand and therefore give it 4 stars.

<Content>OK hotel, nothing special... Stayed at Hotel Metro Sept 15-18. We got access to the room early, at 1 PM, so that was nice. The mini-bar in our room was empty but they did not know anything about that at the Front Desk, they just said that they were going to fix it. I had to ask 3 times about it until they finally found out that there was something wrong with the fridge. Room was clean and big enough. Bed very comfortable. The water pressure in the shower was really bad though. Never tried the breakfast, looked at it one morning and was not impressed. The rooftop bar did not have much to offer, it was a bit worn, flowers were all withered. I was in all a little disapointed, I expected more since it had received so great reviews here.

<Content>Will stay there again My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Metro for 6 nights in August. We had booked it because of the good reviews on Tripadvisor. We had spent a long time trying to decide where to stay. But we are very happy we made this decision. We requested a room on the higher floors and got one just below the rooftop and it was really nice. I think it was a new room. My husband also told them it was my birthday and they had left some chocolates in the room. This hotel is great value for money. The breakfast is good. You get tea, coffee, fruit, bagels, toast, pastries and muffins. Enough to last you until lunchtime!The location is great too! It鈥檚 got Fifth Avenue on one side and Macy鈥檚 on the other. Times Square is only 5 minutes away. I definitely recommend doing the bus hop-on-hop-off thing. As you get unlimited rides for 72 hours we used the bus to go downtown for dinner as well. Saved us on paying for the underground or a taxi.There was one girl in reception who was a bit moody but the rest were helpful enough. I also used the beauty salon and the lady who runs it is really lovely. I had to wait for my nail polish to dry and she told me lots about her life in America. She鈥檚 originally from Romania.Also opposite the hotel a bit further down towards Fifth Avenue, there is a delicatessen store run by a Korean woman. At the back there is a little restaurant type thing which is amazing. My husband and I have lived in Hong Kong and are usually really fussy about our Chinese food but this was really good.All in all it was a good experience. The hotel is clean, good value for money and in a great location. I would definitively recommend it.

<Content>Great for the price! I stayed at Hotel Metro over the last weekend. Even after reading the raving reviews, I was a bit skeptical since I had received such a low price (about $160/night, due to a special Sunday night discount). However, my room was big enough and nicely furnished, and I had no problems through my stay. The complimentary breakfast was a nice perk, as was the free wireless internet access.The walls were a bit thin, and the room, while better than adequate, could have been a bit more comfortable. However, since it's in New York I'd say any price less than $200/night for this hotel would be a good deal.I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to save a few dollars and still have a nice place to stay; if, however, you are looking to pamper yourself I would look for something just a little bit nicer.

<Content>Loved it This is a VERY overdue review. I visted NYC for the first time back in 2003 with my boyfriend and could not fault the hotel. The view from the roof terrace is simply superb. You just sit there in owe of the Empire State Building.The hotel is ideally situated, Macy's is literally at the end of the road with time square and madison square just a 5-10min walk. The metro is also at the end of the block. The service we got at the hotel was faultless. Everyone of the reception staff we encountered were very helpful and gave advice on which metro line to get  type of tickets to get along with details on the bus tours.We were there on BB basis and there was always a selection of bagles, muffins tea and coffee on offer. Although I was getting a bit sick of bagles by the end of our stay.We never ate in the restaurant but heard good reports about it.The hotel was very clean and our room was quiet although our view was onto another building. One aspect that made us smile everyday was on our return to the room at the end of the day, the towels in the bathroom were always folded a different way, triangles, fan, spiral - I never knew towels were so versitile!!Overall we loved NYC and cant wait til we return. Although we will not be staying at this hotel as we want to stay in a different part of the city, I have and always will recommend this hotel to people.

<Content>Another great review We booked our stay at Hotel Metro based on the positive reviews we saw on Trip Advisor. All of the hotels in NYC were expensive when we were going and its hard to know which hotels are actually worth the money. I can honestly say that Hotel Metro was everything that we expected. It wasn't a luxurious hotel and I wasn't blown away, but it was exactly what we wanted and nothing was lacking.The location was great, walking distance to everything but not right in the middle of the Times Square craziness. The free breakfast was convenient and we found the staff to be helpful. The rooms were actually roomy, which I think is rare in the city. This was one of the few hotels where I could actually get a king size bed and be guaranteed a non smoking room. That to me was the worth the price. We requested an upper level floor room to cut down the traffic noise and we were given a room on the 12th floor, perfect. I would recommend this hotel to a friend.

<Content>What a view! This hotel is absolutely perfect. From check-in to check-out we could not have asked for more perfect service. Anu ,the concierge, is the most delightful person and she will do all in her power to make your stay memorable. Matthew on the door is always ready with a smile and helpful hints. Hotel is ideally situated for everything. Subway just at the end of the street; Macy's on the corner and the hotel provides maps, details of excursions and also a voucher to get discount on food at The Playright Irish Bar just a couple of doors away. The deck on top of the penthouse is an excellent way to spend a couple of hours just gazing at the Empire State Building. Bar on deck opens in good weather from 5pm - 10pm. Ice machine on top floor if you want to have drinks in your room. Have read in previous reviews that the staff are arrogant - don't know who wrote this but this definitely is not true. The complimentary breakfast is wonderful. Every type of bagel, muffins, fresh fruit, yoghurts, toast, coffee, tea, juice. Sets you up for all the walking you'll do!! Definitely visit O'Hara's bar at Ground Zero. Paul (owner's son) has a photo album of the aftermath of the tragedy which virtually decimated the bar. He is fantastic and we think he should be Prime Minister of the UK !! When you talk to him you'll see why!! His stories will make you laugh and cry - what a fantastic guy. The whole experience was wonderful. Definitely will go back.

<Content>I love it! This hotel is ideally suited for tourist activities. It's right around the corner from Macy's and the Empire State Building.The building is very clean and well maintained, although one of the elevators was out of service during my stay - no big deal.I noticed that two of the floors were being refurbished so it should be getting even better. All of the furniture and room appointments were contemporary and in great shape. The staff is super friendly and helpful.It's also a good value for Manhattan - I paid $260/night but I noticed that during some time periods it's only $150/night.The rooftop bar is a hidden gem. The views and the vibe are great. If I worked in the area I would totally go up there for drinks after work.I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Restaurant Hotel is very nice.Restaurant is overpriced and the food is way below average. The manager Alex is way too arrogant and thinks he is doing you a favor for this very mediocre restaurant. Prices for this New York City eaterie is outragious when one can venture just down the block and go to a very fine resataurant named Keen's on west 36th Street for the same prices and have a far superior New York restaurant experience. Although hotel and roof top is a very nice amenity defintely stay away from their restaurant and their very arrogant mangager Alex.

<Content>It was perfect! While this place was fairly expensive (although not for NYC), we paid $185 on a Thursday night, it was perfect. It was raining so the bar on the roof was not in use, but that was OK, we went up there anyway to look at the view. The ceiling was sort of strange, but overall the place was lovely and clean. The bathroom was especially impressive, with a shower only, that fit 2 (no tub). WARNING: Maybe I'm the only one who didn't know this, but don't touch the mini bar if you don't intend on paying $8 for a bottle of water. The thing was sensored, so anything picked up for longer than 20 seconds was charged on my credit card. Maybe that's common knowledge, but I didn't know that! We had a view of a brick wall out our window, but I didn't mind because it was a lot quieter than having a street view. It was also a small room, but I expect them all to be small in NYC.It was a few blocks to Times Square. I'd stay again.

<Content>Fantastic stay at Hotel Metro I stayed here for three nights at the end of August 2006.I was traveling by myself so I wanted a hotel that felt safe and was clean and I was not dissapointed.The hotel is in a great location, about 5 minutes walk from Penn station, 1 block from Macys and 5 mins from times square. I was checked in right away and given a room on the eleventh floor. The room was slightly small but extremly clean and felt new, with a very comfortable bed (i noticed they were renovating all the rooms on the 2nd floor). The air conditioning work well to but could be a little noisy if you tried to sleep with it on. The staff was very helpfull to me, and gave me advice on using the phone and train information. The breakfast is pretty basic but is free and the muffins are great. Coffee is served 24 hours which is another nice touch. Another good point is the rooftop lounge (which was very busy when I went up) and the attached bar/grill. Which I had few pints at night.Overall I felt very safe and comfortable in this hotel and will definatly stay here the next time im in New York.

<Content>Hidden Treasure! My daughter, upon turning 21, wanted to go to NYC to celebrate her new adulthood! I researched through TripAdvisor and decided on Hotel Metro. I was a little afraid that it could not live up to it's wonderful reviews but I am here to tell you that we LOVED the hotel. It is in a great location. Right down from a subway entrance and very close to bus lines and right across the street from the NY Empire State Bldg. We were a family of four so we opted for the Family Suite. Awesome! We had two bedrooms, very nice size, and a decent sized bathroom (large shower only) - Room 902! We could see the Empire State Bldg from our room. The patio on the roof is wonderful. We never saw them serving food or drinks from the roof but you could order from the Lobby Grill and take upstairs. We would go to the roof every night before bed just to take in the city lights. The continental breakfasts offered were very good. My only suggestion to them would be to add a microwave to warm up the pastries. We initially were so tempted to stay in a large hotel by Grand Central station and even another hotel by Times Square which was highly recommended but again I was so impressed by the reviews here that I went with Hotel Metro. I am so glad I resisted the GC hotel and VERY glad I did not stay any where closer to Times Square. We enjoyed our four nights, in our very clean quiet room and will definitely stay there again. I felt very safe there during the day AND at night ! Our only interaction with the front desk was at check-in where they were efficient but just a tad unfriendly. However, the lady who cleaned our room was very nice and friendly and very responsive when we asked for additional towels. We loved the hotel AND the city!

<Content>The Metro Rocks Using TripAdvisor again for recommendations in an unfamiliar city, I was more than pleasantly surprised. We were on the 11th floor overlooking 35th Street and looked out of our window to be confronted by the Empire State Building in all its glory, awesome! The hotel is clean, very reasonably priced and superbly located, staff are friendly, breakfast sets you up perfectly and the roof top terrace fantastic. For this price and location you will quite simply will not find anything close. All in, excellent.

<Content>Had a wonderful stay My husband and I enjoyed a week at this great little hotel in mid July.We found it to be extremely well situated, our room was clean, comfortable and quiet. As far as its location is concerned, well it was ideal, being so close to a subway and to Macy's. The breakfasts were delightful and more than adequate, the breakfast area was run by a very pleasant lady, and an added bonus was the availability of a cup of coffee right throughout the day.I would like to mention the wonderful Metro staff, especially James.. Nothing was too much trouble, and assistance and advice was given in the most helpful way. We are elderly people and the curtesy shown to us was exemplaryI surfed the net for weeks prior to our holiday making comparisons between hotels before finally settling for the Metro.I'm positive I made the right choice for us.I have declared to my husband, that for as long as we are able, we should return to New York, each year. In one week, we barely scratched the surface of everything to see. If we do, we will most certainly stay at the Metro

<Content>Good location  Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend during February 06 with my girlfriend. Doesn't look much from the outside but then again no hotel in this vast city looks ultra glamorous from the exterior(with the exception of those around central park).Good location though, 2 mins from macys and other shops. Good links to the subway also.Breakfast was self service. Tea, coffee, fruit juice, cereal, toast, fruit, yoghurts and best of all.....a good selection of Muffins and Bagels! There is also free tea and coffee throughout the day which was a real plus during a cold month when returning to your room for a rest.1 hours free internet access per day which was useful with keeping in touch with the footy results.This was my second visit to NY and from the 2 hotels I stayed at would recommend Metro Hotel everytime!

<Content>Comfortable, cost effective and cozy! My 13-yr old neice chose this hotel from several others I had selected from many, many internet travel services. She made an excellent choice. The hotel is in a good and safe location (important for 3 women) and the staff was good. We asked and got a room (7th floor) in the back so the earplugs we brought along were not necessary. Once we got our location bearings, we walked! The Empire State Building is a block away, Macy's is across the street, Bloomingdales is a 20-minute walk and Central Park and the Met Museum is up Fifth Avenue-about a 45 minute walk. There are 2 good restaurants walking North for breakfast. Go to the ESB around 8am and you will be admitted quickly; otherwise, you will be in a long wait line. Also dine at the Grand Central Terminal at the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The bad part is that they are closed on Sundays. Overall, the Hotel Metro is a wonderful choice for the money, location, free breakfast and advice on food tips. I am going back to NYC for more sight seeing. Do not feel scared (especially if you are a female and traveling solo). Just orient yourself to the street grid and be aware of your surroundings and you will be fine.

<Content>Great location, good value for money Booked this hotel having read the reviews here and were not disappointed. We were allocated a room on a high floor (10th), as requested, with a view out to the street. Room was fairly small (typical for a city centre) but clean and comfortable, having been recently refurbished.The included breakfast is excellent and tea, coffee, etc on tap all day is also very welcome. Rooftop terrace is a bonus during the summer - a peaceful escape from the city.Hotel location is excellent - within easy walking distance of all central attractions but just far enough away to escape the 24-hour madness of Times Square.We would recommend.

<Content>Two Star Hotel? - I don't think so!!! We stayed at the Metro from 30th June to 4th July 2006 and it was excellent. There were 11 in our party and we needed three family rooms and had problems booking them on-line but after a quick call to the hotel reservation staff who were excellent it was sorted very quickly and the rooms confirmed.When we arrived albeit late afternoon our rooms were ready for us. I could rant and rave about location which is excellent but most of New York is close to something instead lets talk about where you will spend the night after a long day sightseeing or shopping. The family rooms we had were spacious not by New York standards but by any hotel standards. Our room had a bathroom with a superb powerful shower that always had hot water. There was a separate room with a King bed for the adults and there were two queen size beds in the main living area for the kids. There were two TV's, one per room, an adequate fridge to chill drinks in and access to an ice maker on the 12th (penthouse) floor. Speaking of the 12th floor, up here there is a good gym, if you are keen, but the jewel in the crown has to be the roof garden where you can relax at the end of the day with friends, a cold drink, and look up at the neighbours across the street on the Empire State Building!!! Each room has an air con unit which I suppose are loud but not so that you get annoyed and during our nights in the hotel you certainly needed them to keep the rooms cool. The hotel supplies a breakfast in the morning and even over the holiday weekend (the hotel was full) there were plenty of seats and loads to eat (albeit that the ladies in charge had to re-stock a few times), bagels, muffins, bread (toaster also), croissants, cereals, tea, coffee, and fruit juices. Breakfast sets you up for the day ahead. Tea and coffee is available free all day for hotel guests. I have seen some complaints about lifts but they were fine and any dealings we had with staff proved their worth. Noise wise, it is New York where car horns have to wear out before tyres, so get used to a bit of noise at night the city never sleeps. My wife and I stayed in the Metro 21/2 years ago and whilst the hotel was good then it is even better now as most rooms have been refurbished and they are finishing the 7th floor at the momentI suppose at 拢150 per night it might have been regarded as expensive but well woth the money considering location, room, and breakfast and tha fact that you can have up to five people per family room.

<Content>Great location, wifi, free breakfast I just returned from a 5 day stay at Hotel Metro and here are my opinions:Positives- Free breakfast (includes 3-4 cereals, many kinds of muffins and bagels), not hot- Location, literally 50 paces from subway entrance.- Free wifi worked extremely well from my room and the cafe.Negatives- Room was small but knowing this going in, it wasn't a big deal.- Street noise was pretty bad. Get a room facing away from the street if possible. Otherwise you'll hear the trash trucks and horns all night.All in all I liked the place but I'd probably try another hotel next time anyhow. I just like to try different places. I paid $175/night and while that is good for NY, it felt like a lot for the small room. But the price was worth it with the free breakfast and wifi.Notes: There is no pool. Our room did not have a pillow top bed.

<Content>Believe the great reviews We stayed at the Hotel Metro based on the reviews on this site and we weren't disappointed. Great location (we walked with our luggage and a 7-year-old from Grand Central), good breakfast, free New York Times, free computer room. We observed one of the helpful staff offering a loaner umbrella to a German man who hadn't even asked for it! (He just said sadly, Es regnet!) Airport transport is available for about $20. We enjoyed the fact that most of the guests were European, but that may have been because it was July 4th weekend. We had a room in the back on the fifth floor that had no view but was incredibly quiet and quite large. We were travelling with our 7-year-old daughter, but she seemed to be the only child in the place. Do try one of the three Korean restaurants next door. We ate in the middle one and loved it! We'll definitely stay here again.

<Content>after planning our trip for my 40th birthday with my best friend .i can safely the hotel metro visited in july 2006.after planning this trip with my best friend to celebrate my 40th birthday,i was 100%happy with the hotel for many things firstly the location,the cleanliness of the entire hotel.staff were very helpful with any query you needed to know.we arrived at the hotel on the 8th of july at night.so the following morning we raced up to the roof terrace to which i was blown away at the sight of the empire state building,was pretty spectacular.at the end of the block was macys store and lots of other good shops.i would recommend the all loops tour which you can easily find their website and book on line for about 25 pound which i thought was the cheapest .took the staten island ferry which was free and takes about ten mins to cross,where you can get off and get back on again,the view of the statue of liberty is unreal as you sail by,the view of manhattan as you sail back is unreal loved it.celebrated my birthday on the tenth of july at one of the many restaurants in little italy,you can imagine the atmosphere as they had won the world cup.my friend and i enjoyed a meal with drinks for about 23 pounds well worth it.still cant believe that i have been to the big apple and if i have the opportunity to visit there again i would most definately stay at the metroi would just like to thank my best friend for making my birthday a one to remember as she booked everything i will never forget her that thank you terri of newcastle upon tyne thanks karen of wallsend tyne and wear x x x

<Content>Fantastic Value Like a lot of people on here we chose the Metro Hotel because of all the positive reviews. I can't really add anything new than what as already been said so I will just go over old groundThe hotel is in a perfect location, we only catched the subway once (which is 30 seconds walk from the hotel) this was to visit Ground Zero plus and the empire state building. We walked everywhere else from the hotel.The breakfasts were fantastic, although it could get busy in the room at the peak breakfast time so we always tried to get down early. Also it was nice just to go down and get a cup of coffee whenever you wanted.We spend most of our evenings back at the hotel metro bar next door which was great to chill and have a few drinks.We only had a standard double room rear facing which was small and we had no view apart from another building but we only ever slept there so it didn't really matter?If we have to say anything negative it would have to be the staff were a bit hit and miss on how helpfull they were but it wasn't even a problem to us. The lady who cleaned our room was really nice though - she would talk to us if we passed in the corridor, but my wife was dawaing funny pictures next to the tip we left for some reason :)We are planning on going back in a few years - and will deffiantly be staying at this hotel again. Please feel to drop me an e-mail if you have any questions david@leedsls10.wanadoo.co.uk

<Content>Fantastic hotel and great staff My husband and I went to New York with my old school friend and her partner - originally we were going to celebrate mine and my friend's 50th birthdays - however our friends decided that whilst we were there they would get married at Central Park. From the day we arrived at the hotel we could not fault the service we got. The staff were absolutely great, especially James and Jetto, who helped us with the wedding arrangements. James recommend a restaurant for our friends wedding night and Jetto arranged for champagne and room upgrades (my daughter had e-mailed the hotel to let them know of our friends wedding). The hotel was very clean and the rooms were comfortable. Breakfast was out of this world - large muffins, bagels which were out of this world, fresh fruit, cereals, fruit juices and tea/coffee - tea and coffee were available all day. There was a sun terrace you could go to and the bar was open there in the evening. Location could not have been better - we were 2 minutes from Maceys which my friend and I made the most of and visited there every day - 5 minutes from Empire State Building (make sure you go at night - view breathtaking) - 10 minutes from Time Square and 2 seconds from Metro. The people in New York were so friendly. The wedding in Central Park was fantastic and everything went without a hitch. We would also most certainly go back again and in fact have made a pact to go back in 5 years time to celebrate our friends anniversary.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel I will say that the hotel was nice. The only thing negative I have to say is that the neighborhood around the hotel leaves something to be desired. We arrived from Penn Station about 9PM. We walked about 3 blocks to the hotel. On the block that the hotel is located, there are several small restaurants. Each of these restaurants had put out their trash for pickup right about the time we arrived. Not only was there about 100 plastic bags of trash, the smell was tremendous. There is enough foot traffic at that hour so that I didn't feel unsafe. Macy's is right down the street as well as major subway and bus lines. And of course, Penn Station. I stayed here one night because of its proximity to Penn Station and the LIRR/Airtrain to JFK airport. The trip to the airport using the public transportation was $10. By cab, it would have cost over $50 with tip. The city caps cab fares but only from the airport to Manhattan. Going to the airport, it's let the buyer beware. Would stay again.

<Content>Excellent location, fantastic price! Very impressed with this hotel given the price. We were expecting to have to sacrifice on some leve of comfort from previous hotels on our trip, but we were pleasantly surprised. Complimentary breakfast, and Wi-Fi in the rooms was an excellent help to us, and the staff were immensley helpful in sorting out early issues that we had with the Wi-Fi.The roof top terrace is an excellent place to sit with a few drinks in the evening, for romantic couples, right up to businessmen winding down after a hard day at work.I'm certainly staying here again for my winter shopping trips, as well as on my next busiess trip, there is simply no reason to pay any extra money for hotels of similar, or in many cases worse quality.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed at the Metro Hotel for 2 nights prior to our cruise and for 1 night after our cruise in December 2005. We liked the Art Deco feel of the Hotel  think it was reasonable value for a New York Hotel.Both the rooms we had were fine, but as we expected quite small however, we were able to store the luggage we didn't need in the luggage room.There was no problem with noise as on both occasions our room were on the higher floors.We thought the extras like the constant tea /coffee was great when we arrived in from the cold and the buffet breakfast was good. Being able to use the facility to check in on line for our flights and print off our boarding pass was useful.The reception staff were helpful and managed to get us transport to JFK despite there being a transport strike and the price was much cheaper than Cunard the Cruise line would have charged us in normal circumstances.On balance we think the Metro Hotel is a good choice if you are realistic about what you get for you money in terms of accommodation in New York.

<Content>Wouldn't Stay Here Again Stayed at the Metro Hotel in June. Small corner room, no view, dark and dismal. Staff un-helpful and un-willing to change room. Room was a little dirty too. Rooms were not cleaned propely, for example a pill was left on the floor from a previous client. On a positive note, the location is fab and you will not be let down by the good time that is to be had in NY!

<Content>Good hotel, great location Excellent location for my first trip to NYC, easy walk to Times Square and the Empire State Building. Friendly helpful staff. Room was rather smaller than expected but nicely decorated. The tub was very shallow and not comfortable if you like baths, but that's minor. Very good deal overall.

<Content>Great quality for the budget minded traveller We were budget conscious when booking the hotel and its services far exceeded my expectations. Its location was fantastic, close to all the attractions, and transport via the Metro is literally 30sec away. We had a quiet room (unbelievable in NY) and although the bed was a lilttle bit on the small side, we had a comfortable rest. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting decent accomodation in NY but don't want to pay the higher prices of the hotel chains.

<Content>right hotel at right location We had read a lot of positive reviews in the internet, but were really surprised to see these reviews topped by our personal experience. The service at the reception was great and very helpful. We had at the first day a problem with our airco and the device was replaced within 1 hour.Room was large and well eqipped, very clean, and had a large closet incl. safe, not common for hotels of this class in New York.Breakfast was great with different kinds of muffins, bagels and breads, fresh fruits, yoghurt, cereals etc. and good coffee. Great is the location, too, because Empire State Building is only a stone's throw from the hotel, it's true for Macy's, too. Metro station (Herald Sq.) is only a few yards away, so that one can reach all places of interest shortly. For us it was the right place to start during the four day stay all our sightseeing tours.

<Content>Fanstastic Value for Money Hotel! I stayed at the Hotel Metro for a week in March and had a fabulous time! The hotel was in a perfect location, literally just around the corner from The Empire State Building and Macy's! We were allocated a room, which to be honest wasn't the best but asked to change with no problem whatsover. Our second room was huge and beautiful, with a fantastic view of the ESB!It was definatley value for money, you could fill yourself up on the vast aray pastries, bagels, toast and cereal in the morning and it'd last you the day! The free hot drinks throughout the day were perfect after a long day shopping or sightseeing! The rooftop terrace would be fantastic in the summer, a little bit too cold when we were there, so I can only imagine! I would definaltey recommend this hotel! The staff were extremely helpful with any queries you might have! And the decoration was wonderful, art deco through and through!

<Content>Great location Arrived May 25th (5 nights) and impressed. Our room was standard and everything worked but my daughter and her husband ended up with a suite at no extra charge. The hotel is one block from the Empire State Building (visible from our 12th floor room) and within 10 minutes of Times Square. The reception was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was more than adequate. The availability of tea and coffee at any time was very handy after a hard days site seeing. Would have no hesitation of returning or recommending this hotel. Only downside was that because our room overlooked the main street we had a lot of noise from the road, particularly when the refuse was collected, which seemed to be every night and the refuse collectors do not seem to realise that people are trying to sleep at 5.00am!

<Content>super hotel! Just back from a 5 night stay in New York, and can't wait to go back! This hotel was excellent! The breakfast really sets you up for the day with a plentiful supply of muffins, toast, fresh fruit, yogurts, fruit juice and much more. the hotel staff were very friendly and gave us good tips on what to see in New York. We particularly loved the roof top terrace which is a nice escape from the busy city, where you can have a drink looking onto the empire state building and watch the world go by. This hotel is very central and is in walking distance to macys, time square and the empire state building. Overall we had a great experience and would love to stay in this hotel again!

<Content>Great location, good hotel Having stayed at the Metro I can agree with almost all the comments made previously. What I would say is if you are going to New York to stay in a plush hotel then you may be disappointed with the Metro. If you are going to New York to get out and about, see all the sites all day and night and simply crash out exhausted then the Metro is ideally located and will suit your needs. The breakfast is great and will set you up for the day. If you arrive at daft o'clock there is a deli just up from the hotel and bars/restaurants almost opposite and down the street.We stayed at the Metro end of May beginning of June 2006 as it was our honeymoon I was obviously concerned. If you were like us more excited about visiting New York and only sleeping etc in the hotel then you should be fine. We were on the fourth floor at the back, at this level with it being Manhattan the room was a little dark, however what else would you expect surrounded by other tall buildings?When we needed information from the front desk yes it was a hit and miss affair, but again what isn't? For us there was far more to see and do in New York to worry about our room. Don't get me wrong though if it was damp, mouldy and smokey I would have asked to be moved and would have been annoyed if we couldn't move.

<Content>A great hotel We just got back from a long NYC weekend. We loved everything about the Hotel Metro!!! The staff was very great, nothing seemed to bother them. The room was very big by NYC standards and very, very clean. Lots of hot water and a nice sized refrig in the room. The location is perfect for uptown or downtown adventures.We will certainly go back to this hotel.

<Content>Super Hotel Just back from a three day trip to New York. Not enough time to do all but we will be back soon. Will definitely book Hotel Metro again. It is very central for shopping and sightseeing.The bedroom was big enough, lovely shower and lots of hot water and spotlessly clean, the bed was really comfortable. The breakfast set us up for the day we could help ourself to muffins, bagels, toast, cereals, yogurts and fresh fruit. there was tea, coffee and juices also. The reception staff and bell boy were most helpful and nothing was too much trouble.

<Content>Great Place I stayed at the hotel last weekend and had a great time. The hotel is affordable and had GREAT food. It is located in the Garment District which was extremely nice. I got to do a LOT of shopping. It is also within walking distance of Time Square and Macy's and most importantly a HUGE Victoria Secret store. I even got to hang out on the beautiful roof top terrace. Overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back! The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. They gave me great ideas on what to do in the City. See you guys again real soon!

<Content>Avoid I do not usually write reviews but do use this site. I was totally mislead by the positive reviews because this hotel was bad. Here is the issues with this hotel and absolutely none were resolved or attempted to be resolved by the staff, their response was the hotel was sold out and the city was sold out so I was stuck.Here are the issues:Mold on the walls, peeling wallpaper, no hot water in the morning, stains on the carpet, very noisy, smoky smells in the halls, no volume on the TV. NewYork hotels are lousy but there is a brand new Residence Inn around the corner stay there instead!

<Content>Disappointed During a recent visit to NYC, I stayed at the Hotel Metro for one night. Overall, I was not impressed. The Hotel itself is located on a narrow street in the Garment District. I got a room on the third floor and it was incredibly noisy ---- all night. Car alarms, trash pickup and people on the street were some of the sounds I heard before finally falling asleep. The rooms were smaller than average, with my room being half the size of the room I stayed at in the Affinia Dumont. There were two single beds, which is not what my wife and I had in mind when we booked the room. The bellhop was basically useless, except for storing bags. While this hotel is cheap, you can do much better in NYC for just a little more money.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Metro and Staff My daughter and I recently returned form a trip to NYC and the Hotel Metro. The hotel itself is beautiful, well-appointed and most importantly centrally located. Macy's, the Empire State Building, Times Square, Theater District, Seventh Avenue, 5th Avenue, and Madison Ave are all within walking distance. If you want to venture further, the subway entrance is steps from the hotel entrance. Every day, my daughter and I would venture out to various places and along the way find additional NYC experiences within a block of the hotel. You can't beat the location.My first room was ok, but after my first day I asked for a room with a tub and with tact and patience recieved one. All rooms are beautiful but some are larger than others. Ask for a bay window room. Don't expect a view regardless but there is a beautiful rooftop terrace that offers a breathtaking view. The Metro offers a nice continental breakfast that continues until 11:00. As a result, my daughter and I normally only bought one additional meal per day. This left $$$ for all the great shopping available. On our last day there, I discovered all the great eateries around Time Square. They're a traveler's dream...Island food, Jersey Chicken, etc., for less than $5. I'll remember this on my next trip.Thanks to the wonderful staff, George and Jeto (front desk) and the breakfast staff, we'll definitely be back. Every day they graciously mapped out our destinations, gave insider tips and sent us out feeling welcomed and supported. Thanks George and Jeto. Unfortunately, one bad note. The bellman called a NYC taxi for us as we were leaving for LaGuardia. The taxi was supposed to cost$22. The taxi charged us $36 because he said he had to wait for us. Who asked him to wait? Anyway, that's the beauty of Hotel Metro. You don't have to deal with taxis, because everything is within walking distance. An added bonus: get on the Metro 1 or 3 and get a wonderful tour from Central Park to famous Madison or 5th for $2.Again, we loved the Metro and we loved the staff. See ya in October.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location We thought the staff was nice and attentive, except for the lazy doormen who never open the door for you. The room was nice, and about average size for NYC. The room was always clean, and tastefully decorated. I'd recommend it. Also, we found a WONDERFUL bakery in Little Italy called La Bella Ferrarra. Try the butter biscuits - you won't be sorry! Also, if you are a beader (make beaded jewelry), there are a couple of great bead shops a couple of blocks away on 6th. And if the Yankees are playing, it's definintely a great American experience to go to the game. We had a blast.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We stayed here in Jan 06 and it was a great hotel, I would recommend it.It is very central location, really handy for lots of the tourist sites. The hotel is clean, and even although the rooms are a bit small, they are fine - because your in new york for other things not to stay in your room.The breakfast is also nice.You'll find alot of business people staying at this hotel,which I think is good.I would recommend this hotel for anyone going to new york, and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Liked the hotel very much We (50, 50, 20, and 15) spent five days in New York and especially the Hotel Metro.There were several other Dutch families in the hotel, next to the many Americans.Our rooms were rooms at the streetside of the hotel (not the lately renovated ones). Next time we would ask for a room at the backside, because we heard those were much quieter. Our sons had difficulties sleeping that well with the carbage trucks which frequented the street every night. But: they got used to it at the end of the week. But nevertheless: the rooms were very tidy and well cleaned.The breakfast was very good and you could eat as much as you wanted. It was also possible to drink coffee 24 hours a day.A great plus was the rooftop: for people who wanted to smoke as well as for people wanting to sit in the sun for some time.Hotel Metro, 35th street (near Macy's) was a great starting point for our American sightseeing trips. You could either walk (even walking to Central Park was ok) or take the metro. We didn't go by bus, because the streets were so crowded. The Metro was much quicker.We liked New York very much and think about coming back within a couple of years. There were so many interesting things to watch and the whole atmosphere was great.Elke V.

<Content>An Excellent Hotel I stayed at this Hotel about 7 years ago and it was excellent value for money then. Having recently returned for a 6 day break it is still excellent value for money.I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews on the site but the family suite that we had was very big for New York standards, the hotel was immaculate, service great and breakfast regularly stocked and very welcome. Tea and Coffee is available 24 hours a day.Location wise for those people wanting to shop and for those going for sightseeing it's ideal. Would I stay here again? Definitely.

<Content>Good value compared with other hotels in area I stayed here my first trip to NYC in december. Once I got over the sticker shock of how much hotels are there I finally settled on this one because it was among the cheaper without being a dump. I still can't believe though at $300 a night it was just as good as a Hampton Inn somewhere else. I could stay at the Ritz in New Orleans (pre katrtina) for that much. The hotel staff were not very friendly or helpful. The room was actually a good size and had a closet. Smelled kinda funny though. Bathroom was very bare and only had a teeny tiny vanity for placing tolietries. It could use some updating. I found it to be a very good location. If you are just looking for a place to crash and this hotel comes up as one of the cheaper ones I would reccomend it. The rooftop terrace is neat and there is a nice lounge by the lobby.

<Content>Hotel Metro We stayed at the Hotel Metro from 29th December for 7 nights, over new year. Having been to New York the previous Feb, we were very excited to be staying more central (pretty much on the same street as Macy's). The hotel has a great location, 10/15 min walk to Time Square and Madison Square Garden and a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building.There was a little confusion over rates when we arrived but all was sorted in the morning, and the staff could not apologise enough.The complimentary breakfast consisted of bagels, muffins, toast etc, which was a great start to the day. The hotel itself i very retro, although we didn't spend that much time in the hotel really, generally out about 9/10am every morning and back about 6pm to get ready for whatever we had planned for the evening.Being our second visit, we didn't do as many touristy things this time round, although we did the the Empire State Building again, you cannot beat the views.We saw our 2nd Knicks game at the Garden, very exciting just being there, i'm not a basketball fan (Boyfriend is) but I found myself enjoying it and really getting into it.Had a very wet but amazing NewYear in Times Square, I can't even begin to describe the atmosphere being there at that time. It is definitely something everyone should experience once in their lifetime. Although saying that I don't know if I would want do it again, just because it's a memory that is best left unspoilt. I think once you've done it, it wouldn't be the same the next time.There are plenty of great restaurants around and we were lucky enough to stumble across a a couple that seemed unknown to tourists and were great value for money. I still haven't seen a Broadway show, but that is definitely on the itinery for next time. There is so much to do and see in New York you probably wouldn't ever get everything done, even if you had a lifetime. New York is so magical and amazing and it is absolutely the best city in the world and after 2 trips we are now planning our 3rd for next Feb.If you haven't been, go, you won't regret it!!!!

<Content>The Best Small Hotel In New York We Stayed in the Hotel Metro on our very first trip to New York. As with any first visit to a new city we were concerned if the hotel would be nice. This was a fantastic hotel to stay in and it has all the amenities you would need. I travelled with my parents so we booked a family suite which consists of two double beds in the main room, one other bed in another room, one bathroom and a small area with a fridge and a sink. There was one wardrobe in the main room but plenty of drawers in each of the rooms. There is also a television in each room and a safe in the wardrobe.There is a complimentary breakfast every morning in the hotel. The choice is very good and includes cereals, toast, frsh fruit, begals and muffins. There is also tea and coffee available 24 hours a day which is perfect after a day walking around the cityThe hotel is in a perfect location. it is situated midtown and it is only a street away from the Empire State Building which we could see from our window and the roof top terrace (open seasonally). Times Square is only a 10 minute walk away in which there are good restaurants and shops. We ate in the hard rock cafe whcih was very good- it looks as if it is just a shop but the restaurant is downstairs. We tried the bus tour around the city - the ticket is valid for 48 hours and it a great idea to help you find your way around the city. We also did the 3 hour island cruise which is run through Circle Line (pier 83). This cruise is excellent and you get a very good close view of the statue of liberty. The Rockefeller Centre is worth a vist especially top of the rock - an observatory deck. The view is similar to the Empire State building but sligtlty better as it includes a good view of central park. The park is also a must to do - we spent 2 days there as there is plenty to do and if the weather is good it is nice to sit and watch the world go by. Some restaurants we went to which i recommend are:-Sevilla Restaurant 62 Charles Street, Greenwich Village. This is a spanish restaurant with a mixture of tapas and other traditional spanish dishes. The staff are very friendly and the food is excellent. Spend some nights in Greenwich Village as there are great restaurants. Another one which we had a good meal in was Bistecca Fiorentina Steak which is on 317 west 46th Street. This is on restaurant Row which has a good chocie of different restaurants. We also went to the View Restaurant (New York's only Revolving restaurant) in The Marriott Hotel Times Square. the food was not very good and not worth the money but the view was amazing. I would recommend go for a drink and not dinner - this is a view not to be missed!Overall I highly recommend that you visit New York and stay at the wonderful Hotel Metro!

<Content>Brilliant Hotel This was our first time to NYC  we spent ages on this site looking for an affordable hotel that had good reviews  it seems we struck gold.This hotel is a little gem! From the moment we got there to the moment we left nothing was too much trouble. The receptionist who checked us in was lovely, I had e-mailed the hotel prior to arriving to ask for a high room  that it was a Birthday celebration for both me  my husband  we had room on the 11th floor (1117) with a box of chocs! The room was facing the front of the street  you could hear some traffic but it wasn't too bad. The room was a good size  decorated exceptionally well. The fridge was handy to store drinks in. We booked a bus tour through them which was handled very well.Breakfast as most people have said was good - huuuuge muffins!!!The rooftop terrace was lovely - the bar wasn't open as we went at the end of April so we just bought a couple of drinks from the coke machine  sat up there taking in the view of the ESB.We would definately stay here again  would recommend it to anyone!!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel My friend and I have just had the most wonderful stay at the fantastic Metro Hotel. The location of this hotel is so central, twixt Macy's and the Empire State Building. The reception staff were so friendly and helpful. There is a ramp up to the main reception for difficult luggage. The entrance was spotless and welcoming with beautiful art deco decor. We were upgraded to a penthouse suite at the back of the hotel so it was quieter than at the front. The room was delightful, so clean and spacious with a lovely bathroom and very comfortable beds. The hotel roof terrace was open with excellent views to the ESB; the only disappointment being that the lights were out on the ESB so we didn't see it's full nightly glory. Bar and music on the terrace in the evening was a wonderful experience. Breakfast was fantastic. Who could grumble at fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, cereals, toast ,juice etc and as much tea and coffee all day long. This hotel is a bargain and so well presented. I shall return and recommend everyone else to do the same. Thank you Hotel Metro for a wonderful unforgettable stay

<Content>Great Location ... OK Hotel My Partner and I stayed at the Metro Hotel for ten days in late March. The first thing we noticed as we stepped out of the cab with our luggage was no bell boys. The entrance features two double glass doors with a couple of steps. Keeping those doors open and lugging bags was a little tricky.We found that the reception desk were a little rude, often talking amongst themselves, first when we were checking in and secondly when we had to call them. I didn't feel the hotel had an atmosphere or vibe like many others i've experienced in NYC. I feel it is better suited to families and older couples.We had a large room with a window out to the street, if you're a light sleeper (like me) than ask for a room in the back section as the noise and the rubbish trucks does filter through. The decor of the hotel is in need for a touch up or revamp and not to our taste. Breakfast menu was great, and the all day coffee was convenient.Location was great for shopping, empire state building, a couple blocks from madison square garden and about 6ish blocks away from Times Square. Overall, we wouldn't stay at Hotel Metro again, there are better hotels in NYC for about the same price.

<Content>Metro is just great We spent 5 nights at the Metro over Easter period. Every aspect of the hotel met and exceeded our expectations.The location is superb being close to Empire State, Macy's etc. Staff were always very helpful and friendly. Internet room provided (free) was very well equiped. Rooftop terrace (bar at night) was just superb with great views to ESB and other buildings of interest. Gym is well equiped. Free continental breakfast was quite good and a bonus as most places it is extra - shame all of the plates and cutlery are throw aways!Overall loved the hotel (decor is lovely). Could not think of one negative aspect of the hotel in the time that we stayed. Would recommend highly.

<Content>Loved It!! We stayed at the Hotel Metro April 9 thru 11. I can't say enough about this hotel and the staff. First, the entire staff were extremely helpful, polite, and courteous. They went out of their way to make this the best stay for us. I had mentioned that this is my daughters first trip outside of California, so they set us up in a great room on the 12th floor with a perfect view of the Empire State Building! My daughter(and myself)was thrilled. The gentleman at the door is a wealth of information on the surroundings and super nice. The room was clean and cozy. I normally have a hard time sleeping comfortably anywhere but my own home, but the bed at this hotel was so comfy, that I enjoyed a good nights sleep. The continental breakfast was plentiful with a great variety of breads, muffins, yogurt, fruit and condiments. The ladies in the breakfast area were also very friendly and they kept the place stocked up nice. I loved everything about this hotel and I highly recommend it. The Hotel Metro will be my choice whenever I head out to the Big Apple.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Metro I stayed at the Hotel Metro at the beginning of April with my Mother and Sister. We had a fantastic trip and it was helped enormously by the choice of hotel and its very helpful staff. The rooms were very clean and not at all cramped. The use of the safe in the room is free, the room also has a fridge. The price of the room includes breakfast which is really great. You have a choice of fruit, cereal, toast, bagels, muffins and pastry. There is also tea, coffee and orange juice. The tea and coffee is available all day! The location of the hotel is excellent with Macys just at the end of the street. The staff were excellent advising us on the most suitable trips for our stay and booking excursions and helicopter ride! The Hotel Metro is fantastic value for money and I have been recommending it to all my friends since I returned home - I will definetely be back!

<Content>An excellent choice! This was our first time in New york and I was keen to get the hotel right - and I did! We had a family suite which was ideal for us and the boys. Their room was front facing and huge-they had a double bed each and their own tv. Our room faced inwards and although smaller was certainly not tiny. We were only on the 4th floor but the traffic noise did not bother us-its all part of being in NY! The breakfasts were great;fruit salad, toast, muffins, croissants,cereals and the all day tea and coffee was very welcome.Everything was spotlessly clean and the art deco theme was stylish and smart. The staff were courteous and as friendly as you need although the doorman was excellent and sorted out a taxi for us to get back to the airport. We were also able to check in early which was great as we were able to freshen up before hitting 5th avenue! Location is superb;everything is walkable, even Central Park and Brooklyn Bridge! We could not find fault with anything and would not use any other hotel if we're lucky enough to come back . Enjoy!

<Content>An Excellent Choice! this is an excellent hotel - very centrally located with a breath taking view of the Empire State Building from both our bedroom window and the roof top terrace - the staff are really helpful and friendly and the bedroom and bathroom were clean, comfortable and adequately furnished - the breakies were brill and really set us up for the rest of the day and I would have no hesitation with regards to staying here again or recommending it to anyone else -one minor initial set back was that the heating/air conditioning was faulty however we needed neither during our stay as the weather was just perfect - this hotel turned out to be an excellent choice !!!!

<Content>Great Value and Service After reading the mixed reviews for the Metro, we weren't sure what we were going to see when we arrived. We arrived 7 hours before check-in, and the friendly staff stored our baggage, and invited us to take advantage of the breakfast buffet. The staff was awesome when it came to giving us directions and were always friendly. The breakfast buffet is a bonus - delicious muffins, bagels, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee, etc. It was crowded at times, but a little patience is all you need. We also ate a meal at the Metro Grill. It was moderately priced, and the food was great.Our room was clean and quiet. We expected a VERY small room from the reviews posted here, but we had plenty of room. Who visits NY to stay in their room anyhow? The location of the hotel felt very safe. You're in the heart of the action - only 2 blocks to Madison Square Garden, and about 5 blocks from Times Square. You can walk anywhere in midtown from here. And there's a subway stop across the street in front of Macy's. The only regret we have is that we went before the rooftop bar had opened - I bet it is lovely in the summer. We took advantage of it to take some cool photos of the Empire State Bldg though.Again on our departure day, the hotel staff stored our bags after we checked out so that we could enjoy the city without carrying them. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family. In fact - I already have!

<Content>Lovely Hotel I booked the Hotel metro on a friend's recommendation and have been recommending it to folk since I got back. We had booked a normal Queen sized room but got upgraded to a double Queen. Not sure if this was because we had told them we were there to get married but if I was going back I'd want the same kind of room again as it was lovely and other reviews suggest that the smaller rooms are quite tiny. The beds were very comfy, plenty pillows and everything was spotless. Other reviews have said that rooms at back of hotel and on higher floors are the best, and that is where our room was and it was indeed quiet (I think this was the quietest hotel I have stayed in, not what you expect in the middle of Manhattan).Staff were polite although not overly friendly, apart from the Hungarian woman on the desk who got very excited about us getting married. I think the 'attitude' is just New York, we found far worse examples of it in certain shops - Macy's being by far the worst.Location wise we couldn't fault it, Subway station,buses, Macy's (if you like that kind of thing), Victorias Secret, Gap all at end of road in one direction, Empire State right there, and only 10-15 minutes walk up to Times Square and Central Park.Complimentary breakfast was fine for us, we had expected to go out for breakfast but we enjoyed the huge muffins, pastries and bagels, with some healthy cereal, fruit and yoghurt to start.We didn't expect to use the internet room, but since our mobile didn't work after the first day we ended up using it alot, and had no problems getting access, they didn't seem too strict about the 30 minute limit either, as long as no-one was wanting the key.

<Content>highly recommended My wife and I stayed at the Metro in mid-March. Location is great, walkable from Penn Station even with luggage, even at night. Our room was large for NY, clean and comfortable. Our room faced the street and there was some street noise, but it didn't keep us up. There was a bit of noise from the adjoining room, but not intrusive. The breakfast is good quality, with bagels and muffins from a bakery, fresh coffee, and a clean and comfortable dining area. We took advantage of free internet, computer and printer in the business center (20 minute limite, and sometimes a wait in the morning). There is a Duane Reade and a green grocer within 2 blocks, both of which we took advantage of. We ate at the Korean restaurant next door (open all night) late one night and found that food to be good as well. We booked this through Orbitz for $150 per night just a day in advance of our trip, and at that rate this was an extremely good deal.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised My daughter and I were pleasantly surprised that this boutique hotel was better than we had hoped. Our double-double room was spacious, immaculate,with large windows,and pleasing decor. Lots of hot water for the shower. Staff is pleasant and accomadating(we were able to check in early). Breakfast ,in a room off of the lobby was quite good, with a choice of breads, bagels, muffins,cereal and beverages. On a short block between 5th and 6th avenue it is A great location, near the subway and walks uptown. We shall stay there again.

<Content>Location, kocation, location I stayed at the Metro 11 years ago, The location is second to none, slap bang in the thick of it, Macy's to the right, 5th Avenue to the left, perfect and this was the deciding factor for a return trip to the Metro. I was disappointed with the decoration of the hotel; it was shall we say tired and clearly hasn't had a touch up since my last trip. Having said that, the rooms were spotless, and cleaned every day. We were on the 12th floor with a great view of the Empire States. We had 2 double beds in our room; the bathroom was big with red hot water, a big cupboard for our clothes and cases and a safe. The fridge came in handy but it was very noisy in the night. We didn鈥檛 have breakfast in the hotel instead we went out, we found a great place called Jimmy鈥檚 on 6th Avenue serving a huge variety of hot foods, which set us up for the day. The Metro promotes Brendon鈥檚 Bar which is opposite the hotel; I would NOT recommend this place at all, and I suggest the Metro remove their association. The staff and service was appalling, we were made to feel grateful for getting a drink. After sitting us down at a table, it was apparent that the diners around us were not satisfied, so we decided to pay for our drinks and leave. We had a great meal in the Metro Grill next to the hotel instead. I would definitely stay at the Metro again but would hope they鈥檝e had a bit of a refurb by then!

<Content>A bit Over Rated With all the rave reviews this hotel got I was expecting a real charmer. What I got was a tiny room and very average service. No doubt this hotel has a great location and is clean but thats about it. If your expecting charm FORGET ABOUT IT! For three nights I ended up paying about $975, a bit steep for a tiny room and tinier bathroom. I could not help but think the Comfort Inn across the street must have been cheaper and offered at least the same level of accomodation (it would have been physically impossible for the rooms to be smaller.) Again nothing terribly wrong with the place, I was just expecting more based on all the great reviews. As for the much vaunted breakfast, OJ and muffins with some not so great bagels (I was born in NY I know bagels.) If it was cheaper I might come back, but as I doubt prices will be falling I will be moving on to greener pastures for my next visit.

<Content>Hotel Metro - Excellent Experience! My wife  I stayed at the Metro because of the reviews we read on your site and a travel guide. We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary  when I did the reservations via their web site, I let them know. When we arrived at 1:00 PM, they told us that our room will be ready around 2:30, so we left our luggage (no charge) and went to Macys (located 2 minutes walking from the hotel). The hotel location is great, just in the middle of Manhattan. When we returned they told us that our room was located at the Penthouse floor (room PH 6). What a surprise we had when we opened the door and found a very nice big room with two windows, a nice view to the outdoor terrace, buildings  the terrific Empire State. But the best was the bathroom: BIG, comfortable shower stall, two wash basins and a stunning big Jacuzzi and another full window. In the night table a small box of chocolates with a Happy Anniversary greeting card, what a detail! The staff was very attentive and friendly. The complimentary breakfast was indeed very good: coffee, tea, juice, milk, toasts (white, wheat and raisins), bagels, pastries, yogurt, fruits, butter and jam. The cost for this very pleasant experience: $175.00 per night! Definitively we will stay here again and again!

<Content>Great little hotel! Great Location! I stayed at this hotel because of the reviews I read on your site. I have stayed in others in the city, but i usually stay downtown, this time I needed one in midtown. The location was perfect; close to Penn Station, Times Square, and many restaurants. The hotel is nicely decorated and the staff was pleasant. The breakfast was more than enough to get us started for the day. The room was on the small side, but that is normal for New York. The bathroom was very clean and actually very big for New York. The only problems were the water temp, hot hot at night and lukewarm in the morning, and the pillows were very small and uncomfortable, almost like airline pillows. One of the best parts of the hotel was the bellhop. He was charming and fast and stored our bags for the day and remembered which one it was without any prompt. I would stay here again, but bring my own pillow.

<Content>Hotel Metro - Worth a stay... As this was a surprise trip for my partner, I wanted something affordable but still good quality. After months of looking on Trip Advisor, I decided on the Hotel Metro.When we arrived at the Hotel, the man on the desk would not let us check in until we gave him a voucher that we could have got through the company we booked the hotel through. Although we had ten pieces of literature that I had printed off, evidentially I didn't have the voucher needed! After travelling a long distance, the last thing you need was to be told you couldn't check in and would need to contact the company ourselves and get a voucher faxed over!?!?! Luckily I remembered reading that the Hotel has an Internet connection, so asked if I could use the PC and look for the Voucher (I had to suggest this!). Finally we sorted it out and I found the Voucher and presented it to them.Before arriving at the Hotel, I e-mailed them several times requesting for a high floor room. When we got into the room, we found it was on the first floor facing the road. (brilliant!!). As this was a special trip for my Girlfriend, I decided to stay where we were and see how it went (instead of making a fuss and asking to be moved). In the end, it didn't matter too much as we were never in the room and I only got woken up a couple of time by traffic outside (your so tired with working all day - you sleep through anything!).The Room was a good size, with the decoration good taste. Also included was a fridge and Safe, which both came in handy during our stay. The bathroom was of a good standard, although the toilet did overflow once....although the maid cleared it up within half an hour which was good.Breakfast was 1st class and settled the day up well. Could have as much as you want, ranging from muffins, toast, fruit and cakes. We often went back time and time again for a refill!!Location is the best part of this Hotel. 10 minute walk to Times Square and 2 minutes to Macys! (which my Girlfriend loved!). The Subway is around a minute walk also, which gives you access to the rest of the City.Free Internet access (although limited to 30 mins) was handy and we used it several times for booking an excursion for during our stay.The Roof Top Terrace was nice and I can imagine in the Summer being popular.Overview:You get what you pay for. We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel and found it exactly what we wanted. Would we stay here again? Maybe. First would look for what else was available. All in all though, was worth the money I paid.

<Content>Great hotel, excellent service Great hotel to choose. The breakfast is plentiful and served until 11am. The reception staff were really helpful. Although the location is great for midtown shopping like Macy's etc.. if you want to hang out in the village it seems a bit far and we ended up catching cabs quite alot. Hotel is near the subway and the rooms were clean with great comfy beds.

<Content>Artful Art Deco Establishment You get what you pay for at the Hotel Metro. For NYC its good value and I've stayed in a few. We got:A big room for NYC standards (go for double deluxe)A clean room with fresh towels dailyA serve yourself eat as much as you like breakfastAll day tea and coffeeA great location in Midtown close to the shops and sights.The service is fine in that authenticate New York fashion. Yes some of the rooms are a bit tired with a bit of worn out carpet or tiny bit of peeling wall paper but I've found them to be clean and everything works. Who spends much time in their room anyway? The hotel bar next to the lobby is good for a pre-dinner drink or night cap and the food is ok too.

<Content>Expensive for what it delivers This hotel does not live up to some of the rave reviews I read on this site and it is expensive for what it delivers. The rooms are adeqaute but old-fashioned, bordering on the shabby. Nobody at the front desk advised me on arrival that there was a free breakfast, and I therefore did not avail of it - indeed these staff, though not discourteous, are not exactly pro-active. The exception is the excellent hall-porter, who is cheerful and efficient and who was coping splendidly with the conditions of Great Blizzard of February 2006. Free Broadband access is only through two terminals in the business centre and users are limited to 30 minutes per session - very inconvenient for anybody needing longer access for business communication purposes. I will not be coming back to this hotel, despite its central location.

<Content>Best hotel I've stayed in Stayed at the Metro from 25 Jan to 31 Jan. I really cannot fault this hotel at all. When I have stayed in other hotels in New York you can usually find something to fault, but not here.Great location, large clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff, free coffee 24 hrs a day, and a fantastic free breakfast.Best of all is the rooftop terrace with a stunning view of the Empire State Building. When I return to New York, I will definitely be staying at the Metro again.

<Content>FAB! After many months of searching for a hotel, I came across this website and settled on this hotel. THANK GOODNESS!! For the money this hotel is lovely, excellent location, good service, fab breakfast, we had a huge room with 2 double beds. We ate in the hotel on our last night as the snow was too deep to go out! We found the food, despite a rather select menu to be very good value and the service was great. We also went to the Marriot revolving bar and found the drinks to be very over priced and the service terrible. I would not advise anyone to go there.

<Content>Great location, Great Hotel!!! We have just returned from our first visit to New York and the Hotel Metro is a great place to stay.It is only 10 minutes walk from Times Square, 1 minute from Fifth Ave, and about 100 yards from Marcy鈥檚.The staff at the hotel are really friendly and helpful and the complementary breakfast is lovely.When we go back to New York (which is soon i hope as it is a most wonderful city to visit!)we will definitely be staying at the Metro!

<Content>A graet hotel in a great location We stayed at the Metro from 20-24 Jan 2006 and had a fabulous time. Check in was quick and easy, the room, while not large was adequate for our needs. There was an in room fridge, plenty of wardrobe and drawer space and the heater was effective but quiet. the bed was really comfortable and when we asked reception for some extra pillows they arrived within minutes. The shower was excellent with really good water pressure and constant hot water. The room was cleaned and made up to a high standard every dayThe complimentary breakfast is really good, it is an 'all you can eat' buffet of cerals, toast, bagels, fresh fruit salad, yoghurt, pastries, croissants, tea coffee and juices and it really sets you up for the day. There is also complimentary tea and coffee served all dayThe location can not be beaten, 1 block from the ESB, 1 minute from Herad square and Maceys and a 5-10 minute walk to Times Square.Thanks to all the staff at he Hotel Metro for a lovely stay at your hotel, we would defiantely return

<Content>Loved the Metro I stayed at the Metro at the end of November 05 while on a 4 day shopping trip with my mother. The location of the hotel could not be better. One street away from the Empire State Building and Macy's just down the street.....Excellent! Also, with the subway literally a minute's walk away at the corner of the street, you could be at your next destination within minutes.The hotel itself was above average for what is classed as a 2/3 star hotel. We paid a little bit extra to stay in a double deluxe room, which was a great size, with two comfy double beds and plenty of room for our luggage, and all our extra shopping bags! The decor in the lobby was lovely - I really liked the art deco style. The free breakfast (bagels/cereal/muffins/toast/fruit/yoghurt/danish pastry) was fantastic too - and really set you up for a day of sightseeing and shopping! And the all day free tea/coffee was great aswell. Overall we were delighted with our stay in the Metro. The hotel staff were always friendly, pleasant and very helpful with any queries we had. I would undoubtedly stay at the Hotel Metro again, and have already recommended it to several friends!

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location I was really pleased with this hotel. It is in a great location, 2 mins from Macys, and the Empire State Building a stones throw away (great view from the roof terrace). When we first arrived the room we was given was really tiny, we could'nt even get into the wardrobe, but when I asked for a change of room there was no problem and we was given a larger one. The staff were very helpful and friendly, even giving me an umbrella when it was raining. Tea and coffee are avaliable all day, and the continental breakfast is served until 11-30am. Maybe the rooms could do with a little 'cheering up' but it would not put me off staying there again. There is a large T.V in the room with at least 20 channels, and the rooms are cleaned and towels changed daily. They will store your luggage for you of you have a late check out.

<Content>Good hotel, Great location! My first time in NYC and was really happy with the hotel i picked. Maceys is on the doorstep which is great when you have lots of bags to carry!! Small, yet friendly hotel and the free breakfast in the morning is really handy, offering toast,yogurts, cereal, muffins and bagels etc etc. Also, free tea and coffee all day every day.Rooms were spacious with a good sized bathroom and double shower, and the rooms had maid service every day. (new towels fresh sheets every day).Our room faced onto the main road so early hours of the morning was noisy when refuge collectors came round (for example!)Just over a five minute walk to time square but central park was a good twenty minutes away-not appreciated in freezing cold temperatures!!(so get a taxi) Most of the hotel staff were friendly, although didn't go the extra mile! Also close by was a cinema and american eateries for evenings out.For those who like Maceys, if you go to the welcome desk you will get a discount voucher which you can use in conjunction with any other discounts that they have at the time! Other tips for those that like to see musicals........ Go to the TICKET booth in Time Square for 3pm and you can get upto 50% off shows for that evening, although i would suggest getting there abit before 3 as the queues can be very long (we queued for 1hr 30mins but well worth it)Would definetly recommend this hotel for those seeking a good hotel in a fab location!!

<Content>Average - Needs a renovation This is an average hotel for NYC. The location is great and there are some good restaurants right next door, try the Korean places to the right of the entrance. However, the hotel is in need of a renovation. The couches in the lobby all have torn fabric and are straight out of the 80s. The rooms are small and are in desperate need of a renovation as well. The bathroom was tiny and the shower/bath was stained from years of use. Overall, it was pretty clean, though our room wasn't serviced until after 5pm. It's not a bad hotel overall, especially for the price. I would recommend somewhere else though if you want something really nice for a little bit more.

<Content>Great location Stayed at Hotel Metro from Dec 19 to 22 2005. Like most people we chose this hotel because of Tripadvisor reviews and couldn't have been happier. We have teens aged 15 and 17 so had requested interconnecting rooms which we were given. Although the twin room was bigger both it and the double room were a great size, with plenty of room for a dresser, large bedside tables plus a fridge and a table and two chairs. Bathrooms were very clean with huge showers. The decor was very art deco. As we were only on the third floor bit noisy at night but then this city really never sleeps! The complimentary breakfast was a great bonus and the public areas all very nice. We had tickets for NY Rangers ice hockey at MSG and Spamalot and both were within a 5-10 minute walk, as was Empire State Building and our favourite shop Macys. Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great location, great staff We were in NYC during the transit strike. The Hotel Metro turned out to be the best location for going uptown and downtown. Travelled w/ husband and 17 and 19 year old kids. Got the family suite. A little pricey but  NYC is pricey. Great to have a breakfast right there so we Floridians didn't need to freeze our buns off to get a cup of coffee or cocoa in the morning. The doorman is worthy of extra praise and a big tip when you leave. He was pleasant, helpful and kind. They gave us room 1002 and one room had a view of Herald Square and the lights at Macy's and the other room had a view of the Empire State building. NYC tips- I emailed MTV several months prior to arrival and got my kids tix to be in the audience. At Christmas they give all audience members a free gift. They got new digital cameras. Within walking distance (15 minutes) on 2nd ave and 35th is a diner called the Gemini Diner. I read a review on menu pages and thought we'd check it out. My kids could care less about fancy restaurants and I hate chains. It was reasonable priced , had awesome food and a huge selection. And homemade desserts. We walked alot, spent alot but had a fantastic time.

<Content>Loved Hotel Metro! I was pretty confident in booking the Hotel Metro after reading reviews on this site. However, I just got back from my stay in NYC, and I was amazed with this hotel. For the price of $147 a night (on expedia), you can't beat this hotel. The lobby is nice, it has a restaurant and a bar, and the continental breakfast and the room it was in was great. Our room was surprisingly big, especially considering NYC hotel standards. It was spotless, including the bathroom and refidgerator. As for location, we were interested in seeing Times Square, Rockefellar Center, and a musical in the theatre district. We were able to walk to all of these places from the hotel (especially considering the transit strike while we were there) within 12 minutes. It is in a great location, the street it is on has several restaurants, and you can see Macy's/Herald Square from just outside the front entrance. Overall, this hotel is amazing for its price range and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Fab Fab Fab Thank you Hotel Metro. This was my first trip to NYC and was worried that I was going to have to shoe horn myself into my room - but what a surprise the room we had was massive. Our travel companions had a slightly smaller room but it was more than adequate. the location is spot on for everything. We walked everywhere although it took us about an hour and a half to walk from Lower Manhatten (staten island ferry) to the hotel!! This is about the longest you will walk. Macys 1 minute ESB 1 minute, Times Square 5-10 mins. Central Park approx 15.Breakfast was adequate, although if you get fed up with muffins and bagels there are many delis nearby. This hotel isn't the Ritz but it is clean, rooms (and beds!!) are comfortable, staff are v.friendly. I would recommend this to anyone aiming to sample the sights and sounds of New York. This is value for money at its best and this hotel truly is a hidden gem!!!Go - go now - don't miss out!!!!

<Content>Wow! Right in the centre of NYC. Excellent hotel. I'm sorry if this review looks long but we had such a good time here I want every one to know how great it was. As this hotel was fantastic. I have recently got back from New York with my boyfriend. We were there for 5 nights from 3rd dec to 8th dec and had an absolutely superb time here. From the moment we stepped off the plane the people were so friendly. This made us feel very welcome and completely at ease. We took the New Jersey transit train from Newark airport to Penn station which is known to be faster to get in to the city than taxis and air shuttles. Only took around 20 minutes and cost $14 each. Then from Penn station it is only a 5 minute walk to the hotel, not worth getting a taxi, and you will not look out of place with a suitcase as not many people care. They are busy going about their own business! When we got into the hotel the guy on the desk was really friendly as were all the people in the hotel. The room wasn't huge but you won't need it to be any bigger if you're here for shopping and sight seeing. There is a fantastic roof terrace which is open all year round but the bar on the roof is only open in the summer. You will have a fantastic view of the Empire State building where you will get superb views.The continental breakfast was also a great bonus as it means you can fill up before doing the sights without worring about where to eat. The breakfast was a choice of cereals, gorgeous bagels, toast, fruit salad, yogurts, fruit juices, muffins the size of your hand, pastries, fruit and tea and coffee. You will definately be filled up by the breakfast as you can eat as much as you like. The hotel is within walking distance of the Empire State Building, Macys, Times Square, Central Park, lots of restaurants, Bloomingdales, FAO Swartz and Broadway theatres. Central Park takes bout 15mins to walk to but well worth it as it saves on cost of taxis which can be slow because of traffic and can work out pricey. I won't go on for too much longer but make sure you book a return to the airport as getting back to airports in a taxi run on the meter and are expensive and may not be available.The food in O'Neils steakhouse was fantastic, never tasted lamb so juicy and perfect, but is a little more expensive but well worth it for the great food and service also if you get the new york pass you get 20% discount.We are already planning our trip back here next year that's how good it is, you don't need to look any further than the hotel metro, it's safe and comfy and clean.If you would like any more info on NYC then feel free to email me and I will try to help. My email address is gemski_b@hotmail.com and title it with trip advisor query and i will get back to you as soon as possible.Oh and go and see The Lion King show on broadway it was amazing, you can normally book seats at the theatre on the day but for normal prices, don't expect to find any discounts for this show as it is too popular. Also avoid The Producers show, it is said to be hilarious but we found it boring and not funny. You can get cheap tickets from the TKTS booth in the centre of Times Square some at 50% discount. But check times of opening normally around 3 for evening shows and be prepared to stand in line for a while.One last tip, wrap up very warm its sooooo cold!!!!Well done for reading to the end ;o)Gemma.

<Content>Great I was at Metro Hotel during this summer.I think it's really one of the secret of New York. The room were clean and quite large for 2 people, but the cherry on the cake is the breakfast, a big continental buffet with deliciouse baggles and croissant.

<Content>Loved the Metro The Hotel Metro was a great find! After reviewing many hotels we found this hotel a gem! Loved the rooftop terrace, in room fridge, free wireless internet, 24hr coffee/tea and free continental breakfast! Hotel staff were friendly and helpful! The room was quiet, clean and the the beds were comfy. We had the double deluxe room. The location was very convenient and safe, close to the subway, delis, Macys, Empire state building, walking distance to the theater district and Times Square! The bathroom was small and can use some hooks and shelves to hang and store items (no biggie). We were VERY pleased with the hotel and will come back again!

<Content>Nice Hotel, Excellent Location We had a great time in New York and were very happy with Hotel Metro. The hotel is ideally located within walking distance of everything - Empire State Building, Times Square, Macy's, shopping and Madison Square Garden. The rooms are somewhat small, but still comfortable, adequate and clean. The continental breakfast is a nice perk. Yes, you can get that food anywhere, but it's convienient to be able to grab coffee and a muffin on your way out instead of paying $15 for it somewhere else. Overall, we're glad that we choose this hotel and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Ideal location Just returned from a 4 night break in New York but feel like I need another holiday to get over this 1! The hotel is the ideal location for anyone wanting to explore all the tourist attractions. It is less than a minutes walk away from Macey's, 5 minutes from the Empire State Building and about 10 minutes walk away from Time Square. Central Park is about a 20 minute walk but theres so much to see along the way it goes really quick. I was actually surprised how near everything was to each other.We bought a Metro card and caught the bus to Ground Zero and the ferry to go to the Statue of Liberty. We didn't actually go onto Ellis Island but caught the free ferry to Staten Island and jumped straight back on to come back. It was a good way to get some great photos. We also caught the ferry in the evening to get some photos of New York by night. It was far from a relaxing break and by the 3RD day my feet were screaming for me to stop walking on them! The free breakfast was a great way to start the day. There was bagels, cereals, fresh fruit, toast, coffee(24 hours a day),tea, juices and muffins on offer. The only downside of the hotel was there wasn't a bath in the room although I'm told that most hotels only have showers so it seems that its not unusual but after all that walking all I wanted to do was have a relaxing soak in the bath. The roof top terrace was closed when we were there, apparently its closed for the season. The rooms are clean, comfortable and of a decent size but to be honest, you spend so little time in the room anyway!If you want to know anything else, just email me and I will try to be of some help!

<Content>Very Nice Staff at the Metro We put up our family here when they visited during the Marathon. Everyone loved it, for reasons already mentioned - the free breakfast, great views from the roofterrace. But the biggest surprise for them was that the staff (including the housekeepers and the nice ladies in the breakfast area) were so friendly and helpful - also, my very particular mother-in-law said she had never stayed in a cleaner hotel, anywhere.

<Content>Excellent New York Experience!! My experience at the Hotel Metro was awesome! Having stayed there in order to attend my sister's wedding, the location, atmosphere,  service was great. My family and I found the hotel to be very clean, comfortable, and what a fabulous continental breakfast they serve!!! I would definitely stay there again as well as recommend it to others looking to stay in a primo spot of New York City!

<Content>Looking for a nice hotel with many extras I stayed at the Hotel Metro last October and would like to recommend this very nice clean hotel again.It is an older hotel but it has a quaintness that is rare these days. It has a very convenient location within walking distance of the Empire State Bldg., the garment district but most of all for the shoppers Macy's. For people in a hurry or just relaxing it has a wonderful breakfast bar which is free to hotel guest. It has many amenties such as free internet and exercise room. I would stay here again and would also recommend the Hotel Metro to anyone wanting a nice safe hotel with convenience.The hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful throughout my stay. I am sure they give that service to all who stay at their hotel.

<Content>A Lovely Hotel I went to Hotel Metro in February with my mother-in-law.I would highly recommend this hotel, as it is ideally situated for Macy's and the Empire State Building. Broadway isnt far away either. Although the room was small the bathroom was a decent size, and we were not in the hotel room that much anyway, we were too busy catching the sights of New York City.We found the hotel was clean and tidy and the breakfast (which consisted of Bagels, Toast, Muffins, with tea or coffee) was very enjoyable.I thought that the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful in arranging our taxi on return to JFK. Also they gave us advice about using the subway and getting to The Statue of Liberty etc.I can understand why this hotel is so popular.Also for all those first timers in New York if you go in the winter months then wrap up warm because it is really really cold.

<Content>Love the Price, Love the Terrace! This is the second time I have stayed in the Hotel Metro, and the next time I visit Manhattan I will stay there again. Our room was only $180 a night, in a central location. The rooftop terrace view of the Empire State Building is fabulous. The hotel is quite attractive and clean, the staff was helpful. What more can I say?I'm not sure why this is only a 2 star hotel-I usually associate 2 star hotels with run-down Ramadas near the airport. The Metro far exceeds 2 stars

<Content>Fantastic Location! I stayed at the metro with my boyfriend from 1-4 october before going to florida and we had an amazing time.the hotel is located in a top spot,close to 5th avenue,macys,times square and empire state building which you had a great view from the hotels roof top terrace.the complimentary tea,coffee,muffins,bagels etc was a great touch as its probably the only hotel in new york to offer this!the rooms are great with everything you need, ok its not the ritz but you dont need a 5 star hotel in this city as you are never in it!!its comfortable, the rooms are clean,the staff are helpful and you just cannot beat the location.we did a few excursions like the liberty helicopter ride, the circle line cruise around manhattan which is a must as its a fantastic day out and you see lots of land marks and its cheap!we also eat the the view restaurant which is a revolving restaurant in times square, the food is ok but the setting is gorgeous, also eat at the tavern on the greenwhich is like a fairy tale land,absolutely incredable and the food was good,we booked these before we went. even though we had only 3 nights here,we made the most and saw everything!!if you are lucky enough to be going or thinking about going,try the metro,it does get booked up quickly though,one of the cheaper hotels too, you will have a fab time and im so jealous!!!

<Content>Great stay at the Metro Stopped at the Metro on our first visit to New York. Booked the hotel after reading good reviews on this site so thought it only fair to add our review. The first thing to say is that I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. The location is perfect for tourists with all the sights within easy reach either on foot or via the subway at the end of the street. Macey's is also at the end of the street and Empire State Building around the corner. The hotel itself is just what you require, although on the small side the room was clean, bed comfortable, sufficient amenities (we did have a wardrobe !!) and the shower and bathroom were a good size. We too had an issue with the air conditioning with our unit not working on arrival however this was immediately attended to.As others have mentioned the breakfast and free tea and coffee was great with the later a very pleasant welcome after a long day sightseeing, making up for the lack of tea/coffee facilities in the room.The staff were very friendly, although we were faced with a frosty reception on our arrival after a long flight and fraught journey from the airport. In general though their helpful and friendly nature during our stay made up for this poor first impression. In summary, as I previously stated, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a clean, friendly and comfortable base for their trip to New York.

<Content>Loved the Metro! My hubby and I stayed at the Metro for the 2nd half of our honeymoon. We decided to be adventurous for the second half...which is why we ended up in NYC.This hotel was so clean and everyone was so nice and so helpful. The room was the perfect size for us, and the a/c was on full blast when we walked in! It felt great!The breakfast in the morning was perfect. We indulged on a little of everything.The location is amazing too. I absolutely loved the rooftop bar. It was such a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building.We wil definitely stay at the Metro again, and we wil definitely recommend it to everyone!

<Content>New York New York ! This hotel was not our first choice for our first stay in New York, we changed from the Quality Inn on Broadway after reading reviews about it on this website - and we are so glad we did!!!!After a traumatic taxi ride from Newark airport it was a pleasure to get to the Hotel Metro where we found welcoming staff and large clean rooms. At all times the staff were exceptionally helpful assisting with the booking of tickets, giving directions or just generally enquiring after our stay in the Big Apple.This hotel is in an excellent location for exploring this huge city on either foot, subway or taxi. The roof top terrace offers some of the best views of the Empire State Building there must be. The buffet breakfast is just what you need to start each day.I hope to return to New York soon and would stay at the Hotel Metro everytime.

<Content>a little gem in central N.Y. Just returned from a 4 night break with my wife and brother.Had booked a 2 bed roomed suite and this was very spacious and had the added convenience of an extra vanity unit.Breakfast was a real bonus and made the cost very reasonable by N.Y.standards.Roof terrace was absolutely excellent particularly on a warm evening when a small bar was opened and you could enjoy a cool drink right under the Empire State.Location fine for all the attractions.Would certainly recommend this superbboutiquehotel

<Content>Not a Bad Choice I was a little unsure of the hotel due to a number of negative reviews in Trip Advisor when I looked at the reviews early this summer. But the positive reviews made it sound good and it had all the amenities I was looking for. The end result was that I was pleased with the choice. Some of the problems may have been related to the ongoing remodeling. Our room was neat and clean and probably a good sized room for a mid-priced hotel - I have very little experience with New York hotels. Here's what I liked: The queen room was fairly spacious. The Continental breakfast was a whole lot more that the fat (making) muffins everyone has raved about - yogurt, mixed fruit, bagels, and cold cereal. Food was very well stocked except maybe cold cereal at the end of the morning. Exercise room was more than the usual couple of tread mills but not a whole lot more. Patio terrace. Central mid-town location within easy walking distance of all up-town/down-town subways and Penn station. Very nice and roomy bathroom. Front desk pleasant and helpful. Two computers for Internet access. Sometimes had to wait. The only negative - towels removed by housekeeping by mid-morning and not replace to afternoon. They were always at the Laundry.

<Content>Great Location! I booked this hotel on the basis of the reviews on this site and I wasn't dissapointed. I got a good deal on lastminute.com and I reckon it was really good value for money. I can not fault the hotel, it was well located in the heart of Manhatten, yet quite peaceful.The rooftop bar had a great view of the Empire State Building.It wasn't The Ritz but it was very clean, comfortable, friendly and did the business.

<Content>excellent value!! Save yourself the hours of on-line researching that I did. Just ante up at the Hotel Metro. I know it's difficult to think of $250 a night as a value, but wait until you see what you get elsewhere. I was very pleased with our stay there. I would highly recommend, though, going for one of the larger rooms. We got one of the small suites so that our daughter could have a room of her own. Her room alone was larger than the room we had at The Plaze for $350. One huge drawback. Turn right out of the hotel entrance, take a few steps west, and there's . . . Macy's! So if you're briinging your wife or teenage daughters, look out. Lucky for me, right at the end of the block was a terrific Italian deli, Giuseppe's. If I had the time, I would have ordered my way through the entire menu. There's also a little coffe shop right across the street. But get this . . . on our first morning there, I walked back into the hotel with one of those $5 bagels and a $3 cup of coffee . . . and there, rihjt off the lobby, is a wonderful buffet breakfast, compliments of the hotel! What an idiot!The staff at the front desk was rather cool and unhelpful, but the wait staff were all very sweet. Finally, take the elevator to the very top. There's a lovely open patio up there. During the day you can sun-bathe, so that the office workers in the Empire State Building next door can ogle you. And at night, check out the same scene, only now with a party crowd sampling the beer on top, on tap!The rooms are starkly post-modern, but in an artful way. Best of all they were clean. Have a Metrolicious stay!

<Content>Fantastic stay We recently stayed at the Hotel Metro and absolutely loved it! We were a bit skeptical at first, because as many reviews as you read, something can always go wrong. We picked this hotel because of the reviews we read on tripadvisor and they were so helpful!! we had a financial situation when we got there and the staff were so helpful and worked it out for us. They even upgraded us for free to a king room that was huge! As soon as you walked in it smelled clean and tastefully decorated. We didnt have a noise problem and slept great though you could hear some street noises in the morning...but hey, its NYC!! The location was great, we were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go and the luggage storage the hotel provided was great and so helpful! the breakfast was great for something quick and light and a good way to start the day. we didnt get down until it almost ended and everything was still fresh and available. we would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Fantastic choice in the Big Apple We stayed at the Hotel Metro during a week's holiday in New York. After reading poor reviews about a lot of hotels in New York, I wasn't expecting much. I was very pleasantly surprised. This Art Deco style hotel was perfect for a city break. The rooms were big enough - we had a view of the Empire State Building from our window! The breakfast was lovely - with fantastic bagels and huge muffins. The location is perfect for seeing the whole of the city and there are various subway stations nearby. Standing on the rooftop terrace while snow falls over the city was memorable. Just don't get ripped off by the unlicensed taxi drivers who wait at the bus station!

<Content>Highly recommend! We stayed two nights and it exceeded our expectations. The continental breakfast included fresh fruit, baked goods, juice, etc. The room small but more than adequate plus had a refrigerator. Nice bathroom; very clean. We were there the hottest day of the year and the a/c worked great. Perfect location. Friendly staff, Icon garage few steps away and gave a discount from hotel. Everything was perfect and can't beat price.

<Content>Love the rooftop deck This hotel is reasonably priced and centrally located in Manhattan. The rooms are just big enough, with small marble baths, and a refrigerator. Don't hesitate to stay here. The free breakfast is served in a nice business lounge, the staff is courteous, the Metro Grill and Bar attached to the lobby is good, but the best part of the hotel is the 12th floor rooftop deck (seasonal of course.) In the morning you can bring your complimentary New York Times up there with coffee and a perfectly toasted New York bagel. In the evening they have a small bar set up for cocktails, or you can BYOB. The deck is a quiet get-away spot in the middle of a hectic city.

<Content>A TERRIFIC Value The Hotel Metro exceeded our expectations!We were upgraded to a penthouse room that had two double beds (perfect, since I was traveling with a friend) and a sofabed. There were two sinks (one in the bathroom and one right outside), a shower and tub combination, a large TV with expanded cable, and a refrigerator. Although we were on the same floor as the rooftop bar, it was very quiet. The best aspects of the hotel were the beautiful condition of the rooms, the friendly desk staff, the free gym, the free internet access (the business center has two computers with high-speed internet), the free breakfast and the free weekday NY Times. That's a huge savings -- gyms can cost $15/day, breakfasts at least $10, and internet cafes cost time and money.My only complaint stemmed from when we tried to alter our reservation. At one point, we tried to come a day later, and they wouldn't change our reservation without raising our daily rate by 25%. We ended up with our original reservation, but if we had truly needed to come later, it would have been a big problem.

<Content>Decent Hotel in Nice Location The Metro Hotel is a nice hotel. It's definitely not a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons but I can say that I didn't have any problems with it. Well, it's easy to find problems with any hotel if one looks hard enough. There were a few little things that were kind of strange, but definitely nothing bad or anything to be worried about. For example, one night one of the maids left one of her cleaning rags in our room. It looked like she had spilled something on the floor and tried to clean it up--and then left behind her rag (and part of the spill, too). It wasn't a big deal, we just threw the rag on the floor by the door and it was gone the next day. I'm sure if we had called the front desk that someone would have come cleaned up the spill (what was remaining of it) but it wasn't really a big deal. It was just kind of strange how it looked like something had spilled and then the maid tried to clean it up but then stopped and left and left behind her cleaning rags and things. Strange. Other than that, everything was fine with the hotel. The front desk staff seemed nice--not overly friendly--but still polite. The hotel had a great air conditioning unit in each room which was great since I was there in July. My friend  I would leave in the morning and not come back to the hotel until late at night and when we would come in, the air in our room would be on and the room was nice and cool and it felt SOOOO good. I got cold at times, though, but that wasn't a problem because you can control the temperature in the room, which is great. Also, some reviewers said they only had a shower in their rooms. I had a shower and a bathtub in my room, although I only used the shower. The water pressure/heat were fine. Again, it wasn't some fancy massaging showerhead that one would find in a 5-star hotel but it was your ordinary shower and it worked fine, so no complaints. I didn't really care for their shower products. They give you shampoo, conditioner, soap, and I think body lotion. They weren't bad or anything but I just preferred a different fragrance, so I just picked up some other shampoo/bodywash from Bath  Body Works. But, I wouldn't have any problem using the hotel's products. Usually my friend and I got up early but when we woke up I was surprised to already hear the maids in the hall cleaning up, but they didn't disturb us because we had the do not disturb sign on the door. So, we didn't have any problem with maids waking us up in the morning by coming in our room or anything (a problem I've had in some other hotels). Also, as some other people have mentioned, each room has a refrigerator in it. I love that! Most hotels these days will give you a minibar, charge you triple prices on everything, and then put up a sign that says don't put your own products in the minibar but it wasn't like that at all at the Metro Hotel. They give you your own fridge and there are lots of 24 hour drugstores and things around so you can buy your own food/drinks if you want to and put them in the fridge. My friend thought the fridge might make too much noise during the night but I don't think it did at all. I never heard it. Besides, if it did then you could always unplug it. We didn't really buy any food but it was nice to keep some drinks in the fridge so we could have something cold to drink whenever we wanted. Also, the hotel does have room service if you don't want to leave your room. Another plus is that the hotel has free wireless internet access. So, if you have a laptop then bring it with you. The signal strength wasn't the best for me but it was good enough to be able to hop online long enough to check your email and things like that. One concern that I had about the hotel is that the rooms do NOT have in-room safes. So I was worried about leaving my laptop in my room. But I did leave it in my room and didn't have any problem. However, the hotel does say that if you have valuables and don't want to leave them in your room, then you can leave them with the front desk and then pick them up later. If you can't/don't want to bring a laptop, then the hotel does have a business center with a computer/printer. There is also a small gym and a rooftop terrace/bar. I went inside the gym although I didn't really workout--I just wanted to see it. I went to the rooftop, too, but it was cloudy and at night and I couldn't really see anything, but I'm sure it would be nice during the day. It definitely gives you a good view of the Empire State Building. My room was on the 2nd floor and so most of the time I just took the stairs from the lobby but whenever I wanted to use the elevators, they were very fast and I didn't have to spend much time waiting. However, the elevators were always hot inside. I don't know why but geesh they were hot. but again, it's just a fast elevator, so I can't complain--it's not like I was sleeping in it, ha ha. Just going from floor 1 to floor 2, which too around 10 seconds, ha ha. I arrived at the hotel btwn 2pm-3pm and my room was ready right away. I didn't have to wait at all. As someone else mentioned, the bed and pillows aren't the best in the world but I walked so much in NYC and was so tired at night that I think I could have slept comfortably on a bed of nails, ha ha. The room wasn't huge but it was a decent size. Our room had a queen bed, 2 desks, a small table with 2 chairs, a large TV, a phone, a radio, etc. Also, if you are in your room and need to find where a museum or store is, then use the guide on your tv, it's really convenient. Just turn on the tv and use the remote to go to your city guide and then you can look at museums, restaurants, stores, etc. The area seemed safe and my friend and I didn't have any safety concerns. In fact, during our entire trip almost everyone we encountered was very friendly. There were a couple not-so-friendly people but you find those kinds everywhere (unfortunately). My biggest complaint about NYC in general is that I HATE how everyone expects a tip and how many restaurants calculate a tip in for you. I went to several nice restaurants and they would always bring me my credit card ticket to sign with the price of the meal and the tip included. I have traveled around the world and NYC is one of the only places that does that and I hate it. I know it's tradition but I don't understand why people can't just pay waiters, waitresses, etc. a normal salary and then not have anyone expect a tip. To me a tip is something I give to someone as a gift when the service has been extraordinarily good. But to me, the service at the restaurants that I ate at was nothing special--one of the waiters was downright annoying, but yet he calculated in a $22 tip for himself. I mean, that's crazy. I'm already paying over $150 for a meal and now I have to pay you an additional $22?? why? you didn't do anything for me besides circling my table like a vulture and messing up the order. I don't know. I doubt it's going to change but I like how in Europe nobody expects a tip. You pay the price of the service and that's it. If a meal is $50 then the meal is $50...and not $50 plus a tip of $7.50, etc. That's crazy and I don't understand it. I hear people complain about it all the time but yet it hasn't changed. I dislike it so much. Sorry--back to the hotel---again, it's not the best hotel in the world. If you are looking to be a pampered King or Queen then you should try the Ritz in Central Park or the one in Battery Park or the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental, etc. But if you are looking for a decent hotel in a nice area, that's close to everything and for a more affordable price, then the Metro Hotel is a nice choice.

<Content>Much more than we expected! We were nervous about choosing a hotel but after reading the reviews here we my husband and I decided on the Hotel Metro. We were so glad we did. We're just average people that stay in average hotels but I was worried about staying in a big city like New York we might end up in a dump. The Hotel Metro was perfect! We were worried about it being a small room but it really wasn't that small. There was room for a queen size bed, TV armoire, 2 nightstands, a small fridge, and even a small table with 2 chairs. The bathroom was plenty big with a shower (not a tub so don't plan on bathing). The bed and pillows weren't the greatest but that wasn't a big deal after we were so tired at the end of each day. Our room was on the 5th floor and I was worried about the noise but there wasn't any. Also I was worried about getting a hotel with good air conditioning since we were there the end of June and the air conditioning was perfect. We could control it and it worked just fine. The workers there were very kind and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was awesome! They had cereal, muffins, pastries, fruit, juice, yogurt, and more and a nice room with several places to sit and TVs with the news on. That definitely saved us money. The hotel is very close to the Empire State Building and there are a couple small stores close to get drinks and snacks to fill up your fridge. There is even a big drug store down the street and around the corner where you can really fill up your fridge. There is a subway stop very very close and we used the subway a lot. Unfortunately there aren't any close restaurants that looked that great. There is a chinese place and some other asian restaurant close and also the Metro Grill is next door but it seemed a little pricey (maybe not for lunch). I would highly recommend staying at the Hotel Metro. You will not be disappointed. If you're concerned about getting a good, clean, decent hotel for your stay in New York the Hotel Metro is for you!

<Content>Fantastic place to stay! Two former New Yorkers who returned after 20 years. We spent 5 nights at the end of June at the Metro. This hotel was the perfect place for our return to the city. 1/2 block from subway station that can take you just about anywhere in the city. The room was bigger and more comfortable than we imagined. We stayed on the second floor facing the street and had no noise issues and a great view as well. Macy's, Times Square, World Trade Center, Little Italy and China Town, Central Park, NYC Library and Rockefeller Center all less than 10 min. away. The view of the Empire State Building from the roof top lounge at night was impressive.Our very minor complaints were that there is only one ice/soda machine in the entire hotel and the continental breakfast was o.k. but not a true NY breakfast. The staff was helpful and friendly. Housekeeping kept the room very clean.The pics on the hotel website do not do justice to the hotel. It is even nicer when you get there. We are already checking our calendar for a return visit.

<Content>Great location Stayed here 6-24 to 6-26 for 3 nights. Great location. Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is only about 15 min. from Times Square and the theatre district. Lots of room for 3 ladies with lots of shopping bags. Not too expensive when you really do need to take a cab, as you are very close to the middle of Manhattan. Loved the roof top. The breakfast is more than enough to send you on your way for the day. If you love a big breakfast though you'll need to go somewhere else. Beds comfortable, and we did not have a noise issue. We were near the back facing a parking lot. I'd rather get some sleep and take in the views while I'm awake. Loved the city and certainly this hotel. Would come back again!!

<Content>Metro Hotel was brilliant! I spent 6 nights at the Metro with my friend (who also wrote a review, dated 19th June) during mid-June 2005 and I must say that this hotel was just great! It's everything that you need in a New York hotel....excellent location (you just can't fault it), great service and polite helpful staff, tasty buffet breakfast and comfortable rooms.It's just a couple of seconds from the subway (a main one - 34th Street - with loads of lines going through it) and is right near Macy's, Empire State Building and not far at all from Times Square (10 mins walk max or one subway stop). Our room was nice and large and beds were very comfortable. Also had a big TV with about 30 channels, a fridge, a table, couple of chairs, chest of drawers, phone, lamps and a large complete bathroom with fresh towels everyday. The breakfast is just right with muffins, bagels, fruit, bread (and toaster), yoghurts and fruit juices, tea, coffee, etc. It's not like a full English you could get elsewhere but it was just perfect for the start of your day (we loved it!).For our first time going to New York and two girls together, we wanted to choose a great hotel with an excellent location and we were not at all disappointed. We didn't have a view (we stayed on the 3rd floor) but we didn't find it a problem as you're out most of the time and everything else makes up for it! I think that overall this hotel is brilliant and is a perfect place to stay while in New York!

<Content>Great for 1st time visitors I have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Metro and can honestly say it was perfect for my friend and I. The location cannot be faulted- Just down the road is a subway station (we bought the 7-day metrocard and found the subway easy to use)- 1 minute away is Macy's- 10 minute walk away is Times Square and all the Broadway shows are within easy reach- Empire state building and 5th avenue is just around the cornerThe view of the Empire state building from the rooftop at night is unmissable. The room itself was large, clean and the fridge was handy for keeping cold drinks. The beds were very comfortable, which was appreciated after a long day of sightseeing and shopping! We didn't have a view on the 3rd floor, but it was very quiet and we slept soundly every night.The continental breakfast set you up for the day with muffins, toast, pastries, cereal, juices etc. Tea and coffee is also available all day.The staff were friendly during our stay. All in all we enjoyed our stay at the Metro and would not hesitate in staying there again for its very central location.

<Content>A great find for families My husband and I visited NYC with our two children, 8 and 13, on May 13-16--a time when nearly every other hotel - even the Belvedere, our favorite - was booked up weeks in advance. We were pleasantly surprised with the Metro Hotel. Stayed in a family suite with two spacious sleeping areas...there was plenty of room for all four of us. Bathroom was small (large shower, no tub) but very clean - as was the rest of the room. The free continental breakfast worked out great, and the hotel rooftop was a great spot to have an impromptu picnic lunch with a great view of the Empire State Building. Subway stations were very convenient - as was the original Macys (the wooden escalators were a big hit). The $250 a night pricetag was more than we would normally pay, but for our kids' first trip to NYC it was worth it.

<Content>great place for tourists Thanks, tripadvisor, for making reviews available...I did lots of research on-line to get the best place for the best price for our hotel room in New York. We had 2 adults and 2 teens in our party, so value was important. Thanks to your reviews, I was able to eliminate some of my potential choices and to pick the Hotel Metro, where we got a family suite with 2 bedrooms- one for Mom  Dad, and one for the teen-age girls. It was roomy, clean, in a great location; they serve a great selection of breakfast items FREE; and the service we got from the staff at the desk was prompt and very friendly. Also had a fabulous meal at the Metro Grill next door. If you're picking between this and something a little cheaper, this is WELL worth what we spent...we'll go back!

<Content>Perfect for our family of 4!! We checked out of the Hotel Metro this morning (June 1, 2005) thoroughly satisfied with our 2-night stay. We had excellent service from the desk, and the bellman was friendly and helpful, stowing all 12 of our bags while we romped around the city today after checking out. We stayed in a family room which had one HUGE room with 2 queen beds, and then another room with 1 queen bed. Our 2 teen boys shared the big room, and hubby  I holed up in the other (with our own door!). Bathroom was lovely, with marble-type tile, extra-large shower, and lovely bath amenities. TVs in both rooms. The location was great...less than 1/2 block to a subway entrance, 2 blocks from the Empire State Building. The only glitch was that the restaurant wasn't linked to the hotel yet, so had to run and get money to pay for breakfast (I skipped the free breakfast this morning because I wanted oatmeal!). The desk told me that they will have things linked up in a couple of weeks to be able to put meals on the hotel tab. The free breakfast was fine -- muffins/pastries, bagels, juice, coffee. I would stay there again. We had no street noise, no rude service, no problems whatsoever. And like I said, our room was huge.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - Perfect Location!!! I just got back from NYC today and stayed at the Metro Hotel for 5 nights from Tuesday 24th to Sunday 29th May. I am proud to say that this hotel is absolutely fantastic! I booked a standard room and having read previous reviews that the rooms can be quite small, looking on the flooring plan for the 5th floor, our room was indicated the smallest but it was certainly big enough for me and my partner along with a queen size bed, table  2 chairs, chest of drawers, TV with 30 channels, fridge and wall closet to hide your suitcases and shopping bags. I would say compared to british standards, this would be a medium sized room to me, probably known as a New York small to them. Our bathroom was quite small but due to the lack of space it was cute and cosy and certainly makes up for it's brilliant spacious shower with glass doors (can fit 2!), basin, toilet, huge mirror, good lighting, hair dryer, air ventilator, fresh towels and nicely decorated in marble decor. I also love the free complimentary breakfast in the morning with a good choice of muffins, bagels, danish pastries, cereals, fruit, yogurts and unlimited juice, tea and coffee. Plus free tea and coffee is also available throughout the day in the executive louge which was an extra bonus. The hotel is perfectly located in an excellent location, a quick 5 second walk to the 35th subway, minutes from Macy's and within walking distance to all the shops and surrounding cafe's in Herald Square and 10minutes walk to Times Square.For a budget hotel, I love the art decor, the simplicity, price and location of this hotel, the staff are very friendly and I'll definently be staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Absolutely loved the Metro!! We stayed at the Metro Hotel May 5 -10 2005. It was our first trip to NYC and booked the Metro based on price and location. The hotel staff was the amoung the best we have experienced. We did not arrive the first night until after 11pm due to a long flight from the west coast. Upon going up to our room we found we needed more hangers (3 ladies traveling together, we had a lot to hang up) we called the front desk and had additional hangers delivered within 30 minutes. (it was almost midnight) Our iron broke during our stay and when we contacted housekeeping we had a new one almost immediately. Needless to say we felt the staff went above and beyond. The room was good size compared to what I have heard about NYC hotels. The three of us felt very comfortable and had plenty of room for all the shopping bags we accumulated.The rooftop terrace was a treat, the view of the Empire State Building is awesome.The subway station is very close and easy to get to, making traveling anywhere within the city a breeze. Buy the multi-day pass and a nice map and explore the city. The locals are very friendly and willing to help if you get lost. I will stay at the Metro again and will recommend it to all my family and friends.

<Content>Sorely Disappointed This was our third trip to NYC in the past year. Previously we enjoyed terrific stays at the Doubletree Suites Times Square and the lovely Omni Berkshire Hotel. On this trip, since we would be staying 10 days, we were trying to find a reasonably priced and well located hotel. After much research, we settled on the Hotel Metro which seemed it would match our needs. Several times prior to arrival, I called and requested a quiet room based on reports I'd read on Tripadvisor. Upon arrival, after a sleepless night on the plane from California, we were told we would have to wait a number of hours for our room. Spent time enjoying Macy's which is very nearby. After dozing off in the hotel lobby, we were finally taken to our room one floor beneath the Penthouse. I knew that the hotel was undergoing construction and questioned whether or not this would be a quiet room. We were reassured by the front desk that there wouldn't be any hammering or drilling. Quite the contrary! We had barely closed our eyes for a badly needed nap when a power drill began in the room to one side and a jackhammer in the room on the other. Above us, a marble floor was being pounded into place. Leaving our room, I stepped over power cords and equipment en route to the elevator. After speaking with the front desk we were given a key to another room. Upon moving our suitcases to this room (which was a fraction of the size...not that the first room was spacious!) we discovered that our new room had not even been cleaned yet. We were shown one other room where the double bed was literally less than one foot from the door to the hallway. (More like what one would find in a motel, I think.) The front desk was not particularly helpful explaining that the hotel was full. Clearly if your hotel is full, you don't worry about unhappy guests. The frosting on the cake for me at the Metro, was when we tried at 10:30 pm the next night to find the ice machine which was unavailable due to the construction. We were told by the front desk that we could bring our ice bucket downstairs and ask at the restaurant next door for some ice! (My daughter immediately marched downstairs in her pj's, ice bucket in hand, and gave the front desk crew quite a shock!) Since we were to be staying for 10 days and our trip was getting off to a bad start, I had my husband in California go on Priceline and bid on a room for us at a different hotel. We spent only 2 nights at the Metro before moving to the wonderful Intercontinental Barclay for the remaining 8 nights. I cannot begin to emphasize the difference. The service, class and ammenties were apparent as soon as we entered the lobby. We slept in total comfort and quiet in a king size bed in a wonderfully large room at a 4 Diamond Hotel well located near Rockefeller Center FOR THE SAME PRICE as what we were paying at the Metro!!! Upon checking out of the Metro, I expressed our disappointment to the Manager who offered absolutely NO compensation or apologies. When I mentioned the incident with the ice, he said Well, what would you have us do? I promptly told him that what I would have him do is suggest that his staff offer to bring some ice up to their guests in this situation, not the other way around. This is NOT what I call customer service and I have worked in a customer service business for more than 30 years. In fairness to the Metro, the breakfast is fairly good and there is a bit of charm to the Art Deco decor. The rooms are very small however and the bathrooms are tiny. Our bed was NOT comfortable and it was difficult to get the room a comfortable temperature. The noise level was definitely UNBEARABLE for us. Above all, the management needs to make SERIOUS effort at realizing that without satisfied customers, the Metro has nothing. Obviously, many people find low cost  location overriding factors. I, for one, also appreciate customer service and comfort and with so many hotels to choose from in a city of this size would never recommend this hotel to anyone except someone who is searching for a low price at the expense of sacrificing other ammenities.I totally love NYC and have found people on the street to be very kind  helpful. On my list of must sees in NYC: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, Central Park, Ellis Island  Statue of Liberty, Grand Central, Times Square  as many Broadway shows as your budget will allow. The wait to go up in the Empire State Bldg can be harrowing, but the view is worth seeing once. On our last trip, we had drinks in the Rainbow Room with a fabulous sunset view looking across at the Empire State Building and I enjoyed that much more. Also, the Observatory Tour of the State of Liberty is very interesting. For anyone with immigrant parents or relatives, Ellis Island is quite amazing. I was thrilled to be able to list my mother's name on the Immigrant Wall of Honor there. Definitely a special moment for me. NYC has far too many good restaurants to name, but the prix fix menus at many are a real bargain. Some of our recommendations include: DB Bistro, Lombardi's Pizza, Serendipity (order the frozen Hot Chocolate!), 21 Club, Bubby's, Acqua Pazza, and definitely brunch at Sarabeth's. NYC definitely is one AMAZING city and we are huge fans!

<Content>Excellent Location! The location of the hotel could not be any better. It is within walking distance to the Empire State Building, Times Square, Madison Square Garden, Macy's and most important of all, the subway station at Herald Square. There is a great Korean restaurant right next door to the hotel that is open 24 hours! I was able to take great night shots of the ESB from the roof of the hotel. The staff were very friendly and professional. My only gripe is that the room did not have extra electrical outlets for my laptop. I had to unplug the fridge to free one up. Our room faced the street so it was a bit noisy especially with the garbage trucks picking up trash in the middle of night. But the noise was tolerable. Overall, the hotel deserves high praise, a large part due to it's location. Happy travels!

<Content>How U Doin? A great NY hotel .... We stayed here from 23rd to 29th April 2005. We chose the Hotel Metro due to the excellent reviews and location. We thought the Metro was spotlessly clean and the maid service was the best we have encountered - fresh towels and bed linen everyday! The buffet breakfast sets you up for the day - does get a little crowded at times but thats expected as everyone wants to get out around the same time. The Metro Grill Restaurant was one of the best meals we have ever had .... cooked to perfection and really friendly staff. Macys right near by but don't forget to source out the 11.5% discount voucher before you starting purchasing. We had a room on the 9th floor but it does get noisy at certain times during the night .... the city that never sleeps and all that so ear plugs a good idea. Hope you all have a great time in NY .... it really is a great city. Have fun !

<Content>Metro hotel - a little gem in an excellent location. The Metro Hotel is in an excellent location - near to Macys  Empire State Building in midtown. Buffet breakfast is included: bagels, muffins, yoghurt, toast, juice, coffee/tea, fruit. At all times coffee  tea is available for the guests from the lounge area.Fresh bed linen  towels given daily, with shampoo, soap, showergel  body lotion in the bathroom for guests. For the fitness fans out there, you can exercise in the hotel's gym, that is located next to the terrace.The staff are extremely polite  helpful; answered all queries  helped us to arrange excursions  return travel to JFK.Attached to the hotel is the Metro Grill. We had a couple of very pleasant meals here, again served by polite  helpful staff.The icing on the cake for this hotel is the lovely terrace area where you can sit  enjoy a drink, admiring the view of the Empire State Building as the sun goes down.

<Content>Good hotel in a great location Just returned from a 5 day trip (12 - 17th April '05), here are my thoughts...Location: Excellent - Macys and Empire State  5 mins, Times Square 5 to 10mins.Cleanliness: Excellent, room was cleaned each day and had fresh towels. Also supplied shower gel, shampoo.Comfort: This is the only area that wasn't great. The noise from outside was really quite loud which wasn't surprising when I had a look at the single paned poorly fitting windows. The bed was also very soft. A pair of ear plugs sorted the noise problem so it wasn't too much of an issue and maybe all New York hotels are like this?Breakfast: Very good - There was cereal, bagels, pastries, yoghurts, tea, coffee, orange juice. Also try the attached restaurant, had some of the best meals of our trip there.All in all the hotel is in a great location, and is nice inside with helpful staff. I would advise buying some earplugs though, and if you get sea sick try not to move too much on the bed!Hope this helps, Paul.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel My friend and I stayed here from March 30th until April 5th, and we were not at all disapointed. Check in was easy, and the staff were very helpful with any questions that I had. We had room 201, which was just at the top of the small staircase, which goes round the reception.The room was very spacious, and was better than what we expected! The bathroom was very clean, and had all the usual amenities (soap, shampoo etc). Even though we didn't use it, it was nice to have a working fridage there too, which, I must say, didn't make any noise!I was woken up once or twice by the traffic just outside, as our room was facing the front. It didn't bother us too much though, I guess that's just typical New York traffic!The complimentery breakfast was nice and light, was simply a choice of muffins, bagels etc, and cereal. I found this to be enough, as there are many places in NY to eat durnig the day, and the portions are huge anyway, so we didn't need too much for breakfast. It was nice also having the TV's on the walls too, to catch up on the news or whatever.When the room was cleaned, it was cleaned up to a very high standard. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is literally a 1 minute walk from the Empire State Building, and a 10 minute walk from Times Square. Macy's Department Store was also just at the end of the road, along with many other shops (in particular GAP and Foot Locker).I am very glad I stayed at the Metro Hotel, and would definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>A great little hotel! Stayed at the Metro Hotel for 7 nights between 30th March - 6th April 2005. Upon arrival check-in was very swift. I had emailed the hotel earlier to request a larger room as I'm very tall. They were very happy to accomodate this request. We were given a room on the 11th floor which was spacious and clean. The bathrooms are lovely, all in marble with a great walk in shower. Each morning while taking a shower I'd look out of the window and see the Empire State Building! What a great way to wake up each morning! The fridge was handy to have as we could store water and other drinks. Also in the room was a small lounge area with 2 chairs, a writing table, drawers, large TV and enough closet space with an iron/ironing board stored here. The free breakfast in the morning was great. Went here a few times while staying here. Nothing fancy just bagels, muffins, fruit, coffee/tea. Handy if you just wanted something light to eat. Did a lot of eating in New York so a light breakfast sometimes was just what the doctor ordered! The staff were all very helpful and kind. I would stay here again as the hotel is exceptionally clean and centrally located. I always felt safe when returning in the evening which was nice. I would have given this hotel 5 stars but the beds were a little soft. Nothing too annoying - we soon got used to them! If you are thinking of staying at the Metro you won't be disappointed. A real bargain here and I look forward to staying there again very soon.

<Content>Ideal Location!! Above average Hotel for the location! Stayed last week (Spring Break...yikes). The hotel is located perfectly...on 35th just a few minutes walk from Penn Station, Times Square/Theatre District, Macy's, Subway lines, 5th Ave, etc.The room was sparse or shall we say minimalist, but clean and well kept. Beds were very average but sufficiently comfortable. We were initially given a very small, dark room on the 3rd floor with views of nothing. We asked for a different room and ended up higher on the 11th floor which afforded a slightly larger/brighter room with views of other buildings. In my view (especially in N.Y.) location is everything! And this hotel has the location without a doubt. The morning/afternoon staff is measurably friendlier and more readily attentive/informative then their PM counterparts...so get your info from the morning crew! A few hints: The Red Bar right next door has a great atmosphere and staff for pre/post evening cocktails. Guisseppes Pizza on the corner has great pizza by the slice in a hunger pinch. PAX Deli (all over Midtown area) great, inexpensive food. The Blue Fin on Times Square is fun, upscale and semi-affordable for dinner and cocktails with the big city vibe. Could go on and on, but you'll figure it out from here...Enjoy!!

<Content>disappointed Booked the Metro because of all the good reviews we have read over the last few years. Stayed 14th March for 4 nights. Room was large enough for the 2 of us and clean, fridge was supplied but no in room safe. Staff were helpful and polite and breakfast was excellent, along with the muffins, pastries and bagels they also supply toast, cereal and yoghurt. Free coffee and juice all day is also a bonus. After reading previous posts which stated the lower 8 floors had been renovated recently we requested a low floor and were given room number 204, (did not look as though it had been recently refurbished). Another post mentioned the excessive noise level on the lower floors but as I could only find the 1 post about this I assumed the person was just being 'picky'. Well, he was absolutely right - dustcarts at 1.30  4.30, delivery lorries etc. It was unbearable. Don't get me wrong, I know NYC is a noisy city, this was my 3rd visit but I have never encountered anything like it. We tried to move to a higher floor but there was nothing available. This did affect our stay and our view of the hotel. Judging by all the other reviews we were just unlucky, as a whole the hotel has everything you need for a short stay but we would think twice about staying there again.

<Content>Great family hotel We just returned from a quick, 4-day trip to NYC and had a great experience at the Hotel Metro. Being Spring Break and St. Patrick's Day Parade week, we had a tough time finding a midtown hotel that would take the five of us - 2 adults and 3 children. I spent 8 hours online shopping hotels and comparing prices and reviews. The Hotel Metro's family suite is ideal. We were in room #806. It includes an enormous bedroom with two doubles for the kids and a second private bedroom with a queen for us. Kitchenette, 2 tv's, large bathroom, nice desk with lots of lamps, great windows that open fully and overlook the Empire State Building. Every inch was sparkling clean (and we are picky). The housekeepers are exceptional. Not a hair or a scuff mark or the hint that anyone else ever stayed in the room. The hotel offers a nice, quick continental breakfast with long hours and in a roomy lounge area. Complimentary NY Times. Around the clock coffee and tea. Great location just a few steps from Macy's and 7 blocks to Times Square. The staff was helpful and always available. When we had to get to the airport in the middle of the St. Patrick's day parade, the doorman actually found us a cab and had it waiting for us when we returned from a last-second shopping trip. When you read reviews that describe a hotel as good or roomy by New York City standards, understand that this place is good and roomy by any standards. Make your reservation and quit worrying.

<Content>Great Location, Good Hotel, Good Value This hotel is in a great central location - Macy's is at the end of the road and the Empire state is almost as close. No traffic noise as hotel down side street. Our 1 bed suite was quite big, 2 doubles in main room, queen in bedroom + shower room and extra sink area. Room also had two big tv's and fridge. Check-in and out were quick, and service as a whole was good, staff seemed friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was great and free coffee all day was a bonus.The roof terrace is great - has excellent views of empire state building. Also a small gym at hotel (free to guests). Good value for money hotel, would stay here again.

<Content>Whats to dislike? My wife and I spent four nights for the Wesminster dog show and had struggle hard to find anything wrong.The room was certainly large enough, clean and in good repair. The bathroom was compact but quite functional and very clean.The heat unit could have been quieter but it was not annoying in any way.The breakfast was quite nice with a good selection of pastries, good coffee (all day long)and Juice. Fresh fruit would be a nice addition.The elevators are small and at checkout/breakfast can bcome over-taxed but we never waited more than a couple of min.I would certainly stay at the metro again without hesitation.

<Content>Beware their duluxe rooms.... We stayed at the Hotel Metro in December 2004 and booked a deluxe room through Thomas Cook. First impressions of the Hotel were good until we saw our 'deluxe' room. I know you don't go to NY to stay in your room but for what you pay, you want to sleep somewhere nice.It was small, dark and smelly, with tatty thread bare furniture and carpet, which also had an iron burn mark on it. On checking if the room was deluxe, the front desk said they had 2 sizes of deluxe rooms. As you can guess we had been offered a small one. Even the maid we spoke to said there were better rooms available.Eventually, after a long telephone conversation with the reservations manager (who wouldn't come out and speak to us), we were offered 2 more rooms, the third we accepted. He stated they were currently renovating some of the Hotel. We suggested they should refrain from offering this room until it was renovated. Where they get 'deluxe' from I have no idea even the third room was what I would call a standard room. However, can't fault the cleanliness of the room, excellent maid service.This did take the shine off the start of our 5 day stay, but New York soon makes you forget. Just don't accept the keys to room 710.........

<Content>It is what it is.... That is -- the Hotel Metro is a moderately priced hotel in midtown Manhattan. If you set your expectaions somewhere around the Holiday Inn level, you'll be perfectly satisfied with this hotel. However, if you're expecting to find four or five-star luxury at this price range (at this or any other hotel), prepare to be sorely disappointed.  There is no question that this hotel has some nice features and added touches. The lobby is certainly above average at this price point, as reported by previous guests. The bagels, muffins and pastries served each morning are fresh and plentiful, and the quality of the coffee is pleasantly surprising. The fitness facility is also better than expected -- most gym regulars should be able to get a decent workout here with only a few compromises to their regular regimen. Finally, the view from the rooftop patio may alone be worth the price of admission -- it is indeed breathtaking.  The rooms are miniscule, without question. I've stayed in quite a few NYC hotels and I've grown accustomed to the small room sizes, but this was SMALL. I get the impression (based upon other reviews) that room sizes vary significantly within the standard size, so this may be something to discuss with the front desk at check-in. In my case, there was barely enough room between the bed and the door for the door to swing open, and the chair and tables which nestled against the window on the opposite side of the room came right to the other edge of the bed. Door, bed, table, window -- that's it. The aforementioned window, furthermore, took a fair bit of effort to open, and there was no screen. I'd be surprised if the entire room was more than 50 or 60 square feet in size. All this notwithstanding, the room was reasonably well decorated, and didn't feel at all shabby or poorly maintained. The bathroom, though tiny as well, was nicely appointed with marble throughout, and the standup shower had excellent water pressure.  A final word with regards to the bed. This was my greatest source of disappointment with the Hotel Metro. The bed (advertised as a Queen) was barely a double, and it was likely the least comfortable I've ever slept in. The springs jutted up throughout the mattress, and I woke up with an aching back each morning. The pillows were tiny as well -- they were more along the lines of those mini airline pillows than those normally found on a bed.  All in all, I would recommend this hotel to budget-minded travellers. In its price range, I'm not certain one could do too much better in midtown Manhattan. Those in search of a bit more luxury, however, should look elsewhere.

<Content>Be careful what room, and what day The staff are nice, and it is convenient. The free breakfast is nice as well as a free New York Times. I would recommend, however, you ask to see the room you get before signing in.  I stayed on a Wednesday night and my room was on the fourth floor. It was garbage collection night and right across the street from the Metro Hotel is a huge, and I mean huge stop. For one hour between 10:30 PM and 11:30 PM they noisily loaded clanking dumpsters and mountains of trash bags into trash trucks. Then the next morning from 6-7 AM the dumpsters were noisly redistributed to their owners. If the hotel windows were better sealed some of this noise might have been lessened. But still, that was an awful experience.  The bed in which I slept actually had springs that could be felt. The refrigerator is just two feet from the bed and makes a lot of noise, especially when turning on. I turned it off for the night. The bed sheets were not even tucked in, so when I get off the bed I had to smooth them out before getting back in.   I also requested a non-smoking room, but got a smoking room.   Considering convenience and price, if the hotel stay had been nicer I would have stayed there many nights over the next few months, but I have switched to another hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel for anyone on a budget We stayed for 3 nights in Aug 2002. Smooth and quick check in, with comfortable, clean, spacious room. Friendly, helpful staff.Situated next to the Empire State Building, and only a couple of mins walk from Time Square and Macys, this hotel is in the ideal location.Very nice hotel, but we have realised for a little more money, we could have booked something a little more swish.

<Content>Lovely little hotel in the centre of it all!! Just returned from a 4 night stay at the metro. This is a great value hotel right in the centre of New York only a 2 minute walk from Macy's and The Empire State building. It's not a luxury hotel by far but it is very friendly and cosy. There are currently some building works going on at the hotel but this did not cause any inconvience and soon there will be a lovely new breakfast room there. The free breakfasts are great and we ate there every morning, there is orange juice, tea/coffee and also bagels, muffins and danish pastries!! yum yum!! The rooms are quite small here, well ours was anyway but it was clean and warm (which was great as is was well below freezing outside!!). You also get all the free shampoo's, shower gel etc so do not bother taking any!All in all we had a great time at the Metro and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a good value hotel in the centre of new york!!

<Content>I Love the Metro I have stayed at the Metro 4 times, most recently 16th - 21st Dec 2004. Its location is excellent, just off 5th Avenue and within easy walking distance of Macy's, Empire State Building and Times Square, and a pleasant stroll up 5th Ave to Central Park.The hotel lobby is beautiful, the staff is very pleasant and knowledgeable and the rooms are spotlessly clean. I am the fussiest person in the world for cleanliness and there wasn't a speck of dirt anywhere.I went with 3 friends and we had 2 twin rooms. Our room was not the biggest I've ever stayed in but it certainly wasn't the smallest, and our friends' room was a very good size. We had no problems getting our requested twin rooms, despite booking over the internet (not with the hotel).Comparing the hotel with when I have stayed before (1996, 1998  1999) I will say that our room and corridors looked a little tired, although certainly not tatty. I believe there has been refurbishment up to the 8th floor and we were on the 9th. And you do have to wait 2 or 3 minutes for a lift at busy times.I would always go back to the Metro as I think you can pay a lot more for the same in New York.

<Content>Christmas week We spent 6 nights at the Hotel Metro and were very pleased. We are a family of 5 (with 3 teenagers) so we booked 2 rooms, including the family suite. That turned out to be perfect for the kids, with 2 bedrooms. The hotel is very comfortable. A great plus is the free wireless internet throughout the hotel. The breakfast was great and I really liked the coffee available all day long. The location in midtown is convenient , less than one block from a subway station. The staff was always helpful regarding directions. I'd stay there again.

<Content>There are better mid-priced options My husband and I spent two nights at the Metro Hotel just before Christmas; we booked the hotel based on reviews posted here. We would definitely not recommend the hotel--there are much better hotels in New York in a similar price range.Although the lobby is quite nice, the hotel's efforts ended there. The elevator carpet was worn and dirty,the staff wasn't very friendly (they were never rude, but barely cracked a smile), and, more importantly, the bed was the most uncomfortable that we'd slept on--the mattress was old and lumpy, so every time we turned over we felt every spring. We woke up tired both days, which was detrimental to our enjoyment of the city. Also, the shower walls in our bathroom were moldy and the shower floor cracked and badly stained. And this was after changing from the first room that we were given (1101), which looked like a prison cell. The free breakfast was really not an advantage--nothing you couldn't get on the street for $2 or less (muffins, bagels, juice and coffee--and they didn't even have a toaster for the bagels). If we hadn't prepaid for two nights we would have definitely changed hotels after the first night. I've stayed at the Park South Hotel and the Roger Williams, both moderately priced and inclusive of breakfast, and enjoyed much better accomodations and service.

<Content>Fabulous hotel; would stay there again! My husband and I decided to stay at the Hotel Metro during our recent December trip to NYC. We were more than happy with the hotel, and would highly recommend this hotel to others. In October we stated at a W hotel in NYC and preferred the Metro, which was also less expensive for a better room.Check-in at the hotel was seamless, and though we booked online through the hotel's website there was no problem with our reservation. In fact, they even upgraded us for free to a better room, for no apparent reason. The room we ended up with was fabulous--huge (the size of my entire apartment), with a nice bathroom and plenty of closet space. For what we were paying we were very pleased. Everything was clean and spotless and the maid service was excellent.We also liked the intimate feel of the Metro, over more impersonal hotels like the major chains. We didn't have much interaction with the staff, though they did stow our luggage on the last day because we had a late flight and there was no problem with this. We enjoyed the free continental breakfast, and ate onc breakfast in the adjoining hotel restaurant, which was good and inexpensive, though the service was painfully slow.The location was excellent too, and we thought we got a lot of bang for our buck staying there. While the elevators were tiny and infrequent, we had the same problem with the W. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our Hotel Metro experience, and would recommend it above the W anytime (the only other NYC hotel we have experience with.) Staying there made our vacation hassle-free and extremely enjoyable.

<Content>CENTRAL Visited New York from 24th -29th November for Thanksgiving and found the hotel more than adequate for us. We were able to view the Macy parade from the bottom of the street. The hotel was central to most activities with most views near at hand. We used our feet and the subway as we had completed the bus tours on our previous visit. As our stay was longer we were able to take in a show. We found the hotel staff very friendly and helpful. One receptionist suggested Keens Steak House around the corner for a meal. This was very good.The room was adequate for midtown. Maid service was excellent. The complimentary breakfast was appreciated and all day tea and coffee likewise. We will definitely use the hotel again due to its site.It was only on arrival that we realised we had stayed in the Comfort Inn directly opposite on a previous visit.

<Content>first time in NY Just returned from a four day trip to NY staying at the METRO HOTEL on west 35th street. Opted for this hotel after reading reviews on this site and was not disappointed. A clean warm basic hotel; More than adequate as a base from which to explore NY. The staff on reception deserve special mention; They were very knowledgeable and couldn't do enough to help with suggestions about the best way to visit all the places of interest and could even supply tickets for most places...We bought our tickets for the Empire state building from them. The free morning breakfast of muffins, bagels and danish pastries and the 24hour free tea and coffee proved very useful as we dived back to the hotel to dump shopping before venturing out again. We had a great time and have no complaints either of the hotel or New York.It was all a wonderful experience but the highlight had to be ice-skating late on friday night at the Rockefeller centre. What an atmosphere!

<Content>What a mistake! Small, depressing rooms and an unhelpful staff (especially if you didn't book directly with the hotel). Made for a disappointing trip to NYC. Maybe some of the rooms are OK, but many (most?) are tiny and run down--see other reviews of the hotel. If you can stay anywhere else, don't take a chance on the Metro.

<Content>Hotel Metro 2-7th December 2004 Just got back after a 4 night stay at the Metro, it was our first visit and we had a fantastic time. I had read mix reviews but was very pleasantly suprised with the hotel. We had a large twin room with all the amenities, the only down side was that there were not tea making facilities in the room you had to go down to the breakfast room where it was available day and night, we also had a noisy fridge in the room but we coped with this we did soo much walking that made us soo tired we did not hear it during the night!!Great location and we managed to do everything that we wanted to during our stay. The staff we extremely helpful they booked our trips for us and gave us money off vouchers for Macy's which was very well received and used!. I will certainly return to New York and would stay back at the Metro.

<Content>Happy with Metro There were 4 of us women in 2 twin bedded rooms. Although our rooms were quite small they were very comfortable and clean. Our sheets and towels were changed daily and the staff were extremely helpful, even coming to our rescue when our shuttle back to the airport was delayed. Complementary breakfast every morning of beigels cream cheese and various muffins with coffee was a nice surprise. This was my first visit to NY. I'll definitely go back and I'll definitely be staying in Hotel Metro and would recommend it to anybody.

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location My friend  I spent Nov 18-21 in Manhattan, staying at the Hotel Metro (located on 34th street b/w 5th  6th.) After doing MUCH research on where to stay that was reasonably priced (read lots of reviews), I choose this hotel and can honestly say that I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel itself was clean, decorated well, centrally located and the staff was VERY friendly. We didn't spend that much time in the room as there is so much to do in NY but it was clean and comfortable and it had a refrigerator, which was a plus. The only negatives I have is that the bathroom shower was VERY narrow  hard to move in (we're petite girls)so if you are of a heavier set, it could cause quite a problem. The complimentary breakfast was OK -  the restaurant on site wasn't bad. The hotel itself is less than a block away from Macy's  other shops like Gap, Vicky's, Express, HM, Steve Madden, Deane Pharmacy and more. It is 1 block away from the Empire State Bldg  about 6-8 blocks from Times Square. A couple of bars are located on the same street of the hotel as well as Subway, a Chinese place and nearby is McDonald's, Burger King  Wendy's. Around the corner on 35th street is Keene Steakhouse - which has excellent fillet, if you are looking for a very nice place to have dinner. Definitely recommend the hotel if you are looking for a reasonably priced place where you can lay your head down after a long day of being out and about on the town.

<Content>great little hotel Had to write in and say all the favourable reviews of The Metro Hotel were justified. Great central location, free coffee all day, complimentary breakfast and lovely helpful staff. We had to change our room since it was over the front porch and pretty noisy but it was no trouble and we were well satisfied with the replacement. Great view of The Empire State Building from the roof, even if it was bone chitterlingly freezing weather. Would recommend it to anyone staying in New York and would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Not bad if you're ok living in a shoe box This is a nice hotel however I was shocked when I opened the door and found a room that is about 20 square feet in size. You can't even open the bathroom door fully because the bed is in the way. It's shocking that they are charging $200 + a night for this room. The restaurant is great and the rooftop/view of the Empire State Building is cool, but if you stay here *make sure you know what size room you are getting because the pictures online are not accurately representing the rooms**.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Two friends and I just returned on Sunday, October 24 from our annual trip to New York and stayed at the Hotel Metro. I have stayed at 4 other hotels in New York over the last couple of years and decided to try something new. The reviews I read prior to making our reservations were all positive so we decided to stay at this hotel.There is nothing negative to say about them. The staff was so very friendly and very helpful. The rooms were quite large (we had a 2 room suite). It was nice to have extra space for the three of us. We have stayed in hotels where you couldn't walk around the bed, the room was so small.Needless to say when we return to New York, we will again stay at Hotel Metro.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Highly Recommend I have just came back from a trip to New York and stayed at the Metro for five nights. The hotel staff were really friendly and a pleasure to deal with. The rooms are a fine size and if you ask for rooms at the front you can see the Empire State Building. This hotel is excellent value for money and it's location is fantastic with Macy's just around the corner along with the Empire State Building. We tended to walk to most places as the location was so central. It was great having the all day free coffee as well as the complimentry breakfast which included muffins and bagels and danish pastries.All in all I was extreamly pleased with this hotel and being my first trip to New York I fully intend to stay there again when I return at some point in the future.I would like to thank the staff for making this trip so memorable.

<Content>Excellent Location I've just returned from my first and long awaited visit to the Big Apple staying at the Metro Hotel from 24th-28th Sept 04 - the whole trip from beginning to end was absolutely fantastic! The hotel was in a superb location -Times Sq  Broadway a 10min walk away; Macy's  Empire State Building even closer at 5 mins! The staff were great (a particular thank you to George and Mike if you're reading this!) We asked if we could change our room after realising we hadn't got a street view and were moved to the 7th floor at the front of the hotel with no problems at all (you therefore might wanna bear this in mind when booking - ask for a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the street, although both rooms were twin, the one at the front was much much bigger). I agree that furnishings could be updated in rooms but that really is my only criticism. On the day of departure we booked a taxi through the hotel to take us to the airport at a flat rate of $80 - a huge black stretch limo turned up although we hadn't booked it! Not sure if this was a fluke but we definitely didnt request it. Was worth it though so again you may wanna bear that in mind. During our 5 day stay we managed to do Empire State Building, shopping on 5th Avenue, a helicoptor and harbour tour, open top bus tours, Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero, Times Square, show on Broadway........my legs are starting to ache again just writing about it! Every ache and pain I felt after such a hectic weekend though was worth it. I would highly recommend arriving with a list of stuff you wanna do/see and speak to your hotel on arrival about the best way to do it. The staff at Metro at least were very helpful and made sure we got to do and see everything in a way best suited to us ($tips always help of course!) I think I've waffled on enough now so on a final note - enjoy it!Danielle xx

<Content>Satisfied Customer Stayed here about a week ago and had a great time. I arrived early in the morning, and even though check in isn't until afternoon, they had my room ready and I was able to get in with no problems. The staff was helpful, and if they didn't know the answer to my questions, they went out of their way to find it. I was very happy with the location. So close to 34th St. Penn Station, which made it easy to get around.The room was small, but when you visit New York, who cares? You don't stay there anyway. It was still comfortable and clean.The complementary breakfast was a good way to get the day started. Nothing heavy, which leaves room for some real New York eats.Overall, I thought this place was great. The price was reasonable, but the location is what makes this place worth staying at. I'd stay here again and would also recommend this place to others.

<Content>Nice Place To Stay! I stayed at the Metro Hotel the first of Oct. 2004 and enjoyed my stay. We had a room with double bed which was larger than most New York hotels and was very quiet. The location is perfect in midtown and the view from the roof top terrace is a great way to wind the day down. All renovated, everything worked fine. The only downside is the location is in Midtown - I would have liked a more neighborhood feel to it. For the price and value, it's a good deal. The complementary coffee and breakfast was wonderful. The staff offered good suggestions on local places to eat which were good. The beds were so-so but I could sleep well on them at night. I would stay here again. Have fun in Manhattan!

<Content>Excellent service We chose to spend 8 days at the Metro based on the reviews we read about this Hotel. They are all correct. The staff go beyond anything that could be desired to make your stay pleasant and comfortable. The rooftop bar with it's views of the Empire State Building is a great bonus.The 10% reduction we received at the Metro Grill as residents in the Hotel was very handy as we dined there every night and found the service there equally charming.

<Content>Good Value, great location Located between 5th and 6th Ave, this hotel has a great location. Easy walk to Times Square to the north and Greenwich Village to the south. Room was small but clean. Staff very attentive and helpful. Nice open-air rooftop bar to have late night drink and a nice view of the Empire State Building. We didn't spend much time in the room and chose this hotel for location and price. Pricier hotels perhaps are more spacious but we don't spend much time in the room.  Complimentary continental breakfast is adequate in a very comfortable lounge area. Small but adequate fitness area on penthouse for those who want to lift some weights or do some treadmilling. Staff very helpful in supplying maps and giving directions. This hotel attracts a lot of European tourists who I suspect get the scoop from the internet. We would definitely stay there again because of the location. My wife is usually fussier than me about hotels and she would like to return there. We booked on Orbitz for around $200/might for a Friday, Saturday and Sunday stay. Also, right around the corner is a 24 hour convenience store which is really convenient. Stocks not only food but band-aids etc and all the little things you might need last minute.

<Content>Less $$$ = Less Comfort The bad first - when my fiance' and I arrived, they said they only had a two-bed room available, which turned out to be two, twin, box spring beds. I believe the room had a broken window because all night, every night, we heard trucks loading and unloading, and sirens, and honking. There also was an unusual stink by one of the beds and the TV channels did not come in clearly.The good- they have nice, clean, marble showers (no tub). The rooms have good air-conditioning/heaters that make the temp in the room comfortable. They have free coffee downstairs all day. Besides all the delivery trucks, it is in a fairly good location next to subs and easy walking distance to touristy spots. This room was OK if you don't plan to be in it for long periods.

<Content>Great Value and Location Bottom line: We had an above average experience and would stay here again.We stayed here based on the reviews on this site and the price. For a hotel in Manhattan, the price can't be beat. I was leery of the room size, but when we entered a good sized room with 2 twins for my wife, our 2 yr. old and myself, I was relieved. We simply shoved the 2 twin beds together. However, this room was facing the street and was on the 8th floor. NYC is truly the city that never sleeps. After the 2nd night we purchased ear plugs. Our 2 year old had no problems sleeping. The lighting in the room was dim due to the fluorescent bulbs.The staff was friendly if you engaged them. They didn't greet you nightly as you came walking in, however, if you greeted them they would certainly respond in kind. The lady who stocked the breakfast area was extremely warm and friendly and engaged our daughter everyday. The hotel lobby, breakfast area and adjoining sitting room were all well appointed.We had one dinner in the restaurant and it was excellent. The wait staff there was also very friendly and gave us advice on where else to go.

<Content>Nothing special We stayed here three nights in August. We found the staff quite unfriendly, often we were ignored when entering the hotel. I would expect a hello from reception staff when guests are returning to their rooms. Rooms are ok, our room had a leaky tap. They seem a bit grey and sad, they need a little brightenning I think. Breakfast was satisfactory, nothing special. Internet access, wireless and free. Thats's it. I wouldn't return, its was just too bland for me.

<Content>The Window Fell out!! We went to this hotel in 2003 as part of our Honeymoon. It was advertised in the Virgin brochure and looked very good value for money and a great location.We arrived late in the evening after having a long flight from LA and was ready for bed. The reception look very nice and the staff equally helpful and nice, although I was told the hotel manager was the person on reception. We were given our keys and made our way up to our room. We were on the 12th floor and I thought brilliant we will have some peace and should have a good view. What a mistake of thinking that!!! When we got in to our pokey room that you couldn't swing a cat in, I thought we were out on the street, lorries below were loading up and banging their doors closed, their brakes sweaking loudly every 5 mins. I thought the window was open and asked my husband to close it. It was open at the top, my husband tried to close it but it was stuck. He asked me to help, we both tried pushing the window up but the window fell out of the frame and crashed down onto the air conditioning unit!!! The frame was so heavy he couldn't put it back in, luckily the window fell in towards us and not out onto the street!!! I rang down to reception and told them their window had fallen out the frame, they didnt believe me. Someone came up and accused my husband of pulling it out of the frame! He was so rude and arrogant, we explained that the window wasnt closed and we wanted to close it because of the noise, he again accused us doing it ourselves, tell me why would I want to pull a window out of its frame, espeicially as both of us together couldn't lift it let alone pulling it out!! I went down to reception and asked to swap rooms. A good tip for all - Ask for the keys first to view the room, check that everything is ok then confirm that you'll have it!! Thats what we did after the incident with the window. We changed rooms, again the room was pokey and if you crunched your neck, you could just see the Empire State building. The bathroom door would not close as the door was too big to get pass the toilet. But all in all the hotel was ok. It was clean, free coffee in the mornings with bagels. If you're on a budget then this is the place to stay. A good location. I personally would not stay here again.

<Content>Great choice... Don't use the phone Stayed here for 10 nights. The room was small and basic but clean; as stated in earlier reviews, the air conditioner and fridge are VERY noisy - bring earplugs. The complimentary breakfast consisted of nice muffins/pastries and coffee - not espresso, as expected. The staff were always helpful and cheery. Great location: subway at corner of block, very close to Macy's and Empire State Building (visible from terrace). As for the phone: I had to make international calls... I know they are expensive at hotels but when there was no reply from the other party I was charged more than 7 dollars anyway... That's theft.

<Content>Metro Hotel - Great Value Stayed at this hotel before so knew it was ok. As usual excellent value in midtown, fantastic view of Empire State building from roof terrace. Across the block from Macy's so double value in my book. Rooms large bright and airy, inclusive breakfast of bagels and muffins still good enough to set you up for the day. Only criticism, bathroom a little on the small side but do not let this detract from a great hotel, with a view to die for. One bad thing happened during our stay, one of the lifts broke down whioh meant a long wait sometimes but not really a problem.It's a little way from Times Square and Central Park but walking in New York is all part of the holiday for me

<Content>definitely go back I just spent three nights at Metro Horel and not bad at all! !!! I took someone's advice and requested a room off the street and it was as quiet of a hotel room you can get anywhere. Interactions with staff were very pleasant. Housekeepers were great to talk to. H2O pressure in the shower was great. Clean, Friendly and good location. Bed might have been a little lumpy but Ive slept on worse. Ive stayed in a lot worse rooms for a twice the money in NYC. I will definitely go back next trip to NYC. I hope no one reads this... I don't want the rates to go up!!! -TIM

<Content>Excellent value, family suite was perfect Excellent value for a 2 bedroom suite - paid $240/night (plus tax), booked directly by phone through the hotel - 1 room with 2 double beds, the other with 1 queen, both good-sized with their own TV's and writing/sitting tables. Quiet hotel, great location, rooftop terrace/garden/happy hour a great feature, along with the comfortable off-lobby lounge where the continental breakfast is served. Staff was extrememly courteous and helpful; excellent deli across the street; great decor. Theater tip -- try the Hourglass Tavern on 46th Street for dinner before a show, it's all 'pre-theater' fixed price specials, lovely Italian/European restaurant, almost quaint inside, great seafood and pasta, cobbler for dessert warm from the oven(!), all less than $20/person complete.

<Content>Great Price- Great Location!! Great location right off Herald Square. We stayed in a queen bed room and I thought the room was very spacious compared to other hotels I've stayed at in NYC The hotel was very clean. You can't beat the price- we got it for $185 a night. The location could not be beat! One block from Macy's and the Empire State Building. Metro stops all over. Easy walk to Times Square and to theatre district. I was surprised that the stay included a continental breakfast. My husband is very picky about his coffee and he said this was some of the best he'd ever had! Breakfast was the usual- bagels and muffins with coffee and OJ- all very good. Our room was very quiet. The staff was efficient- most were very friendly. For this price, you can not beat this hotel. We will stay here again. Only improvement would be to update the furnishings.

<Content>Great location and price with an authentic NYC vibe I stayed at the Hotel Metro last weekend, June 17-20,2004. I too was a bit leery reading the reviews on this site, but found the hotel to offer a true New York experience that I doubt could be found at most large, popular chains. For the $150/night we paid for the room on hotels.com, we were thoroughly satisfied and would stay there again.The hotel is a meer 4-5 blocks from Penn Station and Times Square, and less than one block from 5th avenue, on the edge of the Fashion District. The decor is a sophisticated and sexy art deco style, themed around film stars of the 1930's. The waitstaff was prompt and pleasant during all exchanges.The rooms were well appointed but small. Accomodations were clean and comfortable, and the bathrooms boasted a refreshingly different rose marble decor with a fully enclosed glass shower. There is a rather large refrigerator in the room as well, an expected bonus in a downtown NYC hotel!Besides an interesting decor in the lobby and rooms, the hotel offered several other interesting areas for gathering and entertainment. There is an attached restaurant/bar next door called the Metro Grill. The atmosphere was pleasant, the barstaff friendly and quite generous :) There is also a rooftop bar, with an extremely upclose view of the uppermost towers of the Empire State building (which is on the next block). To our disappointment, the rooftop bar was not in operation during our entire stay, which was over a weekend. The nights were rather cool however, which may explain why. The hotel also had a well appointed rooftop gym.Overall, our stay at the Hotel Metro was excellent and I highly recommend it. However, due to the size of the rooms and overall theme, I do not recommend this as a family hotel. For couples looking for a sophisticated, sexy theme in the heart of Manhattan, it's a sure bet. Also, priced $50-150/night cheaper than many other downtown NYC hotels, it is an excellent bargain.

<Content>fantastic for the family We had a wonderful time in NYC June, 2004 while staying at the Metro Hotel. The suites are large and comfortable, easily housing our family of 4. The continental breakfast was convenient and tasty, and the hotel staff was wonderful. The location was great, close to subway stops, Empire State Building, and Times Square, and our room was a quiet resting place. I will stay there every time I visit NYC.

<Content>Really great hotel After reading about the reviews on this site, I went there warily, but this hotel excellent. It was priced in the mid-range for New York, not too pricey, not too low, and the quality was excellent. We stayed from June 17-22, 2004. The air conditioner always worked, the staff was helpful, and it was walking distance to the Empire State Building, Penn Station, Times Square, and the subway. I would stay there again in the heartbeat. We couldn't hear any noise from the outside, and the view from the roof-top terrance was great.

<Content>Sound bet for Manhattan virgins We stayed at the Metro in May 2004. We chose a double double room (two double beds) and made sure it was at the back and non-smoking (following your previous reviewers). Hotel is in brilliant location for seeing all of Manhattan. Decor is tasteful Art Deco and roof terrace/bar has great views of Empire State Building etc. Room was very clean and mainly quiet (although air con was a bit clunky and we overheard someone at reception who said she had had a sleepess night as hers leaked) and binmen woke us up on Monday a.m!I wouldn't get over-excited about the free breakfast - it's just bagels and muffins.The Metro Grill serves good quality food but very pricey. Overall we were pleased with our choice.

<Content>Satisfactory We stayed for five nights at the Metro. We had a queen room. It was a nice size with a comfortable bed. Art deco decor but rather plain. The chairs had worn fabric, needed recovering. Bathroom small but nice. We had a room in the back so it was very quiet. The rooftop terrace had nice views. The hotel is on a fairly quiet street but is walking distance to Penn Station and Times Square. Subway a block away. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Price for this room seemed high to me but I guess is average for New York City.

<Content>Perfect This was my first stay in New York and I was looking for a hotel that was good value and in a good location. The Metro provided both of these perfectly. The rooms were clean, the staff helpful and it was surprisingly quiet given the location.The simple buffet breakfast is included in the price and there is a great bar/restaurant adjoining.I will be staying here again on my next trip.

<Content>Fab Location - ideal hotel for the NY virgin on a budget Stayed here at the end of Februayr and had a great time. Took advice to request a non-smoking room which was at the back and very quiet - we unplugged the fridge. Breakfast was a bonus. Tea/coffee available all day was good. Fantastic location. Very clean room of good size. Great hotel for the money.

<Content>Won't stay here again I attended a day and a half conference in New York City recently and stayed two nights at the Hotel Metro. Given the great reviews and the suggestion from the conference organizers, I thought it was a good choice. The location was great and well within walking distance of the conference and the Empire State Building. However, the room was tiny and of Days Inn quality. The carpet was dirty and the building smelled of cigarette smoke ( I know people on the east coast smoke in the buildings unlike the L.A. area), but it was bothersome. I also didn't see any rampsfor people who use wheelchairs or scooters and the building and elevators would not accomodate a person with a disability easily. Staff was friendly enough and had good ideas about what shows to see and things to do while in the city. This hotel would not be my choice for my next trip to NYC and oh, I haven't slept on box springs in twenty five years!

<Content>Travelers beware! Upon arrival the staff was really rude - they mixed up our room reservation - and threatened to throw the three of us (mom and sister and I) out onto the street. The manager finally gave us a room with 2 twin beds. Sleeping in the crack of 2 twin beds pushed together was not fun, especially after long days in NYC.The room was very TINY. The bathroom was microscopic. 2 people could not stand in it at the same time.The room was very loud and we could hear everyone coming and going in the hallway all night long (2 am - 8 am).Would not stay here again.... ever

<Content>Just what was required The advice here was one of the reasons I chose the Metro and I wasn't disappointed. Great location, room was fine, free coffee and continental breakfast. I didn't have occasion to really talk with the staff that much, but the servers in breakfast always said hello and were friendly.Given the location there is bound to be some noise off the streets, and if the heater or fridge in to room bother you, you can unplug them,Presentation of the room and bathroom, tidiness etc. was excellent - well cleaned and tidied.I would recomend this to anyone on a budget, good value and worth returning to.

<Content>Would stay again We stayed here in March 2002 thought the hotel was great. Some of the staff could have been slightly more helpful. The location is excellent in between broadway and 5th Ave, just round the corner literally from The Empire State Building.Would stay there again

<Content>It was far better than we were expecting We booked a trip to NY for my wife, myself and brother and sister-in-laws. It was a deal with BA. We didn't know what to expect really, but the Metro Hotel was far more than we had expected. Very clean, polite staff and the room was nice too, the bed was extremely comfortable. The complimentary continental breakfast was very good, but on the down side there wasn't enough seating in the breakfast room so you would either have to go back to your room or sit in the lobby. The roof top terrace was brill got lots of good pictures from there of the ESB which is located less than 5 min walk away as is Masys!! Women and shopping!! Any way Metro Brilliant. One piece of advice... If your going to NY stay at the Metro, good Value for money.

<Content>highly recommended Stayed here for four nights in april and could not fault the hotel in any way. Staff were friendly, rooms clean and the free breakfast was excellent. A must for any visitor is the roof terrace, even if the bar is not open you must venture up for the best view of the empire state building you will find in manhattan. Also highly reccomended is the metro grill next door.

<Content>A hidden jewel My wife and I stayed at the Metro Hotel just after Christmas in a parlour suite with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building. We could not believe that this was a three star hotel as it warranted more. The complimentary breakfast was an added bonus. The hotel is in a great position tucked away in a side street but within walking distance to Macy's, the Empire State Building and Times Square. This was our first time in New York and we would not hesitate to go back to this hotel.

<Content>Great Value  Stayed at the Metro in Sept 03 on our first trip to NY. Excellent midtown location just one block from Macys, with very helpful and pleasant staff. Great value for the 5 nights we stayed. Roof top terrace on 12th floor is a must, as it's in the next street to the Empire State so you look straight up at it from the terrace. Room was good sized double with well appointed bathroom and more TV channels than you've ever seen. Breakfast room is excellent with enough bagels, muffins, jucies etc to fill you for the day and a constant, free supply of coffee available all day. Will certainly use the Metro in future. (Don't miss the revolving cocktail bar on 49th floor of Time Square Marriot Hotel too!)
