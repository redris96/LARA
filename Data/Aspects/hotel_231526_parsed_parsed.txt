<Content>Pleasantly surprised We booked this hotel via a travel agent having done no prior research. We then looked on Trip Advisor and were quite worried about the hotel. We stayed for 3 nights (9th to 12th December 2008) and paid 213 euros including breakfast for two of us. We thought it was good value for money.We stayed in room 333 on the third floor. This is one of the floors that has been refurbished and was absolutely fine. They are still working on other floors and if you choose to lie in or nap in the afternoon you will hear noise - but it did not effect us as we were out most of the day. The location is really great and in my opinion could not be better. Be careful outside as pick pockets are rife as you walk down the small street from the hotel to the Rambla. I guy tried to do me - asked for the time from the wrong side of me - leaning in - I told him to [-] off rather loudly and he scarpered. We did get ripped off though in one of the Irish bars in the street - a pint and a half of Stella - a staggering 9.25 euros! Good restaurant we used was La Fonda - lovely place and 8.5 euro for the menu del dia including wine.

<Content>disapointing We have just reurned from the hotel rialto from a 4 day break, when we arrived only room available was small box at the top of the hotel without windows. We complained to manager who moved us to a very slightly bigger room with a window unfortunately air con was stuck on high so they pulled the fuses as this was the only way to switch it off. Every morning around 8:30 am building work started on the roof for a couple of hours, drills and hammering. Rooms were never cleaned, they only made beds. Mini bar had been taken out and no tea/coffe making facilities. Not what we booked, we were very dissapionted.

<Content>Better than expected - great location I had seen some bad reviews after I had made the reservation and yes the hotel is still a bit of a building site as it is going through renovations but it was not as bad as I was expecting.The rooms are cosy for sure but 卯t is a good location and a reasonable price.

<Content>Great for exploring the city We have just returned from Hotel Rialto. We were quite worried from reading the reviews as we had already booked the city break, but it was fine. It has a great situation right in the heart of the city, i was surprised that we heard nothing from the room. We had a redecorated room which was nice but would have been better if we had a fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. The building work is still going on but only during the day they didn't interrupt or ruin our stay at all. This would be great for anyone would wants a stop over for exploring the city, don't expect luxury.We would stay there again if we go back to Barcelona.

<Content>Just barely OK. I should have read the reviews on Trip Advisor before booking this hotel. It is in the middle of renovations, the halls are a mess. The room was not bad when you closed the door to the hall!! The front desk was somewhat indifferent. We complained about the first room, were the offered another, and it was not really much better. They made not comment at all about the mess in the halls, torn rugs, workmen etc. The location is OK, although the Ramblas is not as nice as it used to be, getting a little seedy in parts. I would try one of the newer areas nearby next time, like the Born or Gothic districts.

<Content>What a dump! Thank Christ we only had to stay in this dump before we moved on. Booked in Haste from Expedia, Needed somewhere cheap for a night before we moved onto the Regencia (see review) The hotel from the outside looks good and it is in a prime location!However as soon as you approach the lifts you know something is wrong. We stayed on the second floor and upon exiting the lift it looked like a 1950's Squat.The first room we were given smelt of Human faeces and was dark, damp and AWFUL. We went straight down to reception to complain and we were moved to a marginally better room. The room we stayed in overlooked Calle Ferran. The room was still dark and smelt of damp. The bathroom was awful in very bad repair, stains everywhere.We made our comments noted to the manager upon check out the next morning and were told that they have a certain section alocated to Internet bookings!!!! We could not believe this....So implying that if you book the direct you get a better room!! I would never recommend staying here unless it was the only room left in Barcelona.

<Content>Hate the Rialto We stayed in the rialto hotel for 2 nights as from the 12th June up to 14th June, before our cruise. Thought this hotel is in the heart of the Gothic quarter, next to the Town Hall and to all the shop. We are in a surprise when we went to our room. The carpet in the corridor look wears out. Also the corridor was poorly lit. When we open the window three walls face us back. The next day when we came back to the hotel after a whole day out sightseeing, the room was not yet clean. The entire dirty towel was still in the bathroom and the bed was still the same as we left the room. We complaint to the reception but that was not easy as they do not speak English well. We had to ask for clean towel and soap. It was such a disappointment. I will not recommend this hotel to any of my friend.

<Content>Rialto love hate We stayed in the Rialto for one night on June 11, before our cruise. The situation of this hotel is great, on a picturesque small street with antique wrought street lamps and old buildings. The lobby is bright and nice and looked very much like a small 3* hotel. However, when we went to our room the #200 on the 2nd floor it was like entering a slump house in the middle of demolition. We had to take a long detour in small hallways to reach that small and dark room which smelled moldy, had the ceiling cracked and stained by water leaking problem, the floor creaking... There was a tiny, very dirty balcony with a big hole in the ceiling and looking down to a shaft that is so dirty and glum that it's scary to stay there. We've asked to change and we didn't have to insist, the reception gave us right away, the # 216 which was better though it did not worth the 184$ we paid for the night. That room has 2 single beds, is bigger, the floor is entirely scratched, no balcony, only with a window looking out to the other wing of the hotel which is in the process of renovation so at 8:00 AM we could no longer sleep with all the noises of walls demolition. The good points are: the bathroom is nice with plenty of hot water. The beds mattresses are firmed and bed sheets are crisp and clean. We had a good night sleep, no noise (until 8:00AM). The hotel is situated in a nice street that in the mid-morning it became a promenade ( forbidden to cars), 3 minutes walking to Las Ramblas and 2 minutes to the Cathedral.

<Content>Serious problems with the reception staff Dear Sirs,I was disrespected by a member of the reception staff, who even received full support from the hotel manager. Their location is good, but the sense of hospitality and good behaviour is very badThe rooms are poor and smell like being closed for years.I hope that the group management loks and analise the many people saying the same thing inside this and other sitesSincerely yours,Lilian Ferreira

<Content>May 2008 - mid week break We have just returned from a four night mid week break to Barcelona staying at the Rialto. The position of the hotel could not have been better only two minutes from Las Ramblas. We took the train from the airport, very convenient and cheap and then the Metro to the hotel, again very straight forward.The hotel is undergoing some refurbishment - mostly the corridors, this didn't intrude on our stay. Our room had recently been upgraded - good bathroom with walk in shower. Whilst the hotel is in the centre of Barcelona we didn't hear much noise from outside - good double glazing and air conditioning so didn't have to open windows. I would liked to have had coffee making facilities in our room - not sure if this is standard practice in Spain.We booked on a room only basis and did not eat in the hotel - breakfast 14 euros seemed expensive compared to the cheap cafes in the surrounding streets.We would definitely recommend the Rialto and would return when we next visit Barcelona.

<Content>Great Location Just spent 3 nights at Rialto Hotel during very busy May Day holiday weekend. Comfortable quiet hotel in a suberb location just off Las Ramblas close to the Cathedral. Our room was a good size, clean and comfortable with 3 full size single beds and well appointed bathroom (great shower  lots of hot water). Metro stops Liceu  Jaume both close by and hotel also within easy walking distance to harbour/beach area. Buffet breakfast in pleasant basement restaurant had plenty of choices with both hot and cold dishes available.The city was very busy and crowds and queues everywhere.Bars and restaurants away from Las Ramblas are much cheaper and can be less crowded. T10 ticket on metro is great value (7.20 euros for 10 rides) and can be shared. A1 Airport bus goes to and from Placa Catalunya and is much cheaper than taxis at 4.05 euros per person - takes approx 20-30 mins. Hop on - hop off City Tour buses are a must for first time visitors but be prepared to queue!

<Content>It is a good hotel with great location i have traveled in July 2007 to this hotel.i stayed there 3 nights and had no problem with anything at all.In the time that i traveled there were constructions going in the hotel but had little effect on me (except some noises).My room was on the street side (which could be a plus or negative thing depending on your preference) and we could see many people passing by and the street below.At night however it was little noisy.I only used the room for sleeping at night and stayed out of hotel during the day.i did not use the hotel restaurant(there is a little Shawarma place right across the street with great food and low prices.)Every thing was working in my room and the room was clean.so if you are not a super-picky person this hotel is very nice.

<Content>Good location We arrived in the morning at the same time as another American couple who were unhappy because their travel agent had told them this was a four-star hotel. Make no mistake, the rooms are smaller than any Motel 6 that I know of and there is no one to greet you and porter your luggage. Instead, this is a clean budget hotel in an excellent location.The night clerk was friendly and helpful; the day clerk less friendly but able to meet our needs. We obtained a room long before check-in time. It was a tiny room with a nice modern bathroom and impressive shower. The bathroom smelled strongly of sewage and the courtyard outside our window was noisy. We should have asked for another room, but we were too tired. The included breakfast was far superior to any European Breakfast in the U.S.Bring ear plugs and be prepared for the smell, or be prepared to ask for a new room. If you do so, and understand that your budget room will be small, then I think you'll fing this hotel is a bargain given its wonderful location.

<Content>Excellent Location The hotel was in an excellent location, the rooms were spotless, however as we were in a refurbed room!!!! there was no mini-bar and the vending machines were expensive 鈧? for small bottle of water. You have to pay for the use of the safe in your room 鈧? per day. There were no Tea/coffee making facilities in room which i expect to be standard. The breakfast was ok.DO NOT book a taxi from hotel as they do not inform you that the Taxis charge extra for telephone bookings, it cost us 鈧?5 FROM the airport to Hotel and 鈧?6 from the hotel TO the Airport.The hotel was very quiet considering it was located on a busy street and a few bars down the road. At the end of the day you pay for what you get

<Content>A perfectly fine hotel We had booked into another hotel within the group which then due to a water problem could not accommodate us so we ended up at the Rialto.I am so pleased that we did!The reception staff were extremely helpful. They explained that the rooms we had been booked into were due for renovation but they were absolutely fine and spotlessly clean. The reception staff seemed able to answer any questions we had about Barcelona and were happy to arrange a taxi for us at the end of our stay.Breakfast was super - with a whole range from cereal to cooked to continental to fruit with tea, coffee juices and water available.The only noise we heard was on one night when the dustbin men collected from the rear of the hotel - the rest of the time it was peaceful enough for us despite it's central location. We stayed four nights in all.As for it's location - it really is extremely close to the Placa Reial and Las Ramblas. The Gothic area is just five mins walk the other way. The nearest stop for the Tourist Bus is probably about 10 minutes walk away and the hotel is between two metro stops so access to anywhere in the city is possible.All in all we would definitely stay there again and in fact it was actually the second stay at the hotel for the friends we were travelling with.

<Content>only good location. will never stay in this hotel again I just came back from Barcelona and stayed 4 nights in the hotel. Right after checked-in and moved the baggage in the room, I had told myself that I will never stay in this hotel again.The lift is always not working. During the 4 days, we have to walked from 3th-floor to the lobby. On the last day to check out, the lift is still not working, we have to walk the stair and take the heavy baggage to the lobby.The canteen for breakfast is in the sub-ground with very weired smell.The rooms need considerable decoration. No cup for drinking. The lime is dropping. The door in bath room can not well closed.

<Content>Rialto Great Location This hotel is in a great location just off Las Ramblas. We had read that there could be some noise because of its central location but we did not experience any and we were there during the weekend of the Barcelona Marathon and a Champions League match between Barcelona and Celtic. The hotel is clean, the staff are helpful and pleasant. We would certainly use this hotel again if we went back to Barcelona.

<Content>Liked the rialto We have just got back from a 4 night stay at the rialto, and i can't really complain about anything. We were in a recently renovated room,which was very clean. The breakfast was nice, with loads of choice, even our fussy 2 year old found something to eat. The room was quite small, but what do you expect, plus with the amount of time you spend in your room, you don't really need a massive amount of space. The rialto is in the perfect location for sightseeing, and shops!! All in all we had a good stay, and if we ever went back to Barcelona, we would stay here.

<Content>Disappointing experience, great location We stayed at Rialto on a Saturday late October for 2 nights, a double (twin beds pushed together) on 6th floor. Arrived early morning and staff were happy to store our luggage until our room was ready around 2pm, and also gave us breakfast vouchers for that day which was nice. There are two small lifts in the main lobby with a third which only goes to 5th floor. One lift was out of action by Saturday afternoon, the second died on Sunday morning and apparently service was not available until Monday. It was virtually impossible to get the remaining lift to respond. Our room was clean but very small. The air conditioning was very noisy so we didn't use it, and there was a distinct odour of drains in the bathroom (which had been renovated - it looked great but didn't smell too good). No refrigerator either.The staff after a good start were not particularly helpful.Overall our experience at the Rialto was disappointing but it is in a great position in the old town area.

<Content>Disappointing I don't know how this hotel earned its stars. The rooms were small, although they were clean and the bathroom was nicer than expected but don't count on amenities. Beyond that, the beds were not great, the staircase often dirty, the lifts slow when they were working at all, breakfast was mediocre (and the coffee bad), and there was only one person on the staff who seemed particularly capable. The nicest part of the hotel was probably the lobby. In addition, the location, which is right in the center of the old town, is great. If you were looking for one word to describe the hotel, it would probably be worn. So the stay was not unpleasant, really; and if the hotel had only 2 stars, I would have been completely satisfied. But we had expected more, particularly for the price we paid.

<Content>The nightmare-hotel We came to hotel Rialto an evening in may for a longweekend. The room was small and shabby, but we just unpacked and left our suitcases open at the small bed (120 cm for two persons...). Big mistake. Huge. Cause when we came back after dinner four hours later the sprinkler above the bed was full on and our room totaly soaked and wet. All our clothes, our laptop and cellphone - wet and out of function. So we called the reception and told them what happened. Their answer? Sorry but we can麓t help you now. The sprinkler was still on and the room looked like a bathroom. At least we got another room - but it STANK of mould. So we asked the frontdesk if they had another room were we didn麓t got mould poisoning, so they removed us to a little cubby-hole. Next morning we asked to see the hotel manager to discuss the damage at our luggage, but the frontdesk was extremely uninterested and just ignored us. The last day we finally got to see the management staff and filled in insurance papers and discussed the accident. They promised to compensate us within the next month. But we never heard from them so I called the hotel manager after three months - and he just hunged up on me, twice. This was the worst hotel we ever had stayed in, of many reasons: the disagreeable reception, the lying management, the filthy rooms with the stank of mould and the present renovations that made a constant noice. The location is however great, but that麓s the only positive thing we can mention about this place. We will definitely return to lovely Barcelona, but never ever to hotel Rialto - a park bench seem to be a more attractive alternative rather than that hotel.

<Content>Great location Stayed here for 4 nights, our room was old fashioned and dated but ok for the amount of time you are in it on a city break. The only down side was that our room had a frosted window which made it dark and it did not open. But our friends had a lovely room with opening french doors!Looks like they are gradually doing the hotel up as the reception was very modern. Breakfast was good and plenty of it. Bar was ok, again a little old fashioned.The main feature of this hotel is its location, just a short stroll from La Ramblas, this made it very easy to get around as also only a couple of minutes from underground and buses. Pleanty of places to eat within a few yards of hotel door!Overall good value for money.

<Content>Nice 3 star - great location! Have just returned from a 2 night break staying at the Rialto and found it to be a perfectly acceptable 3 star hotel. We arrived about 10.30 in the morning, so obviously our room wasn't ready for check-in, but the helpful man on reception said it was ok to leave our luggage behind the reception desk until our room was ready. we returned at 12.30 and went to our allocated room - i have to say first impressions of the lift and corridor weren't great, but as previously metioned the hotel seems to be undergoing some refurbishment, so I can allow for that. The 1st room we were given had water dripping from the ceiling, quite substantionally as there was a puddle on the floor. We rang reception and were immediatley allocated another room, at the front of hotel as we had requested, and found this to be perfectly adequate. It was clean and functional, the bathroom was spotless too - i would guess this room had been one of the refurbed area's (518). The view was just fab, and the lovely hustle and bustle from the street below really helped to make our stay - i guess some people wouldn't like the noise, but we loved it. Breakfast was fine, pretty much every taste catered for - no complaints there. Room cleaned every day, fresh towels and bedding, and reception staff friendly and courteous. The location definatley gets 10/10 - try the Oyster Bar next door for early evening tapas and lovely cold white wine! Avoid Schilling Bar - over priced and horrible surly barstaff, not to mention making you wait ages and ages to pay! Should have walked out, not waited! Check-out time was before 12, which is later than a lot of places and once again, we were able to leave our luggage in reception. Overall - this is a clean reasonably priced hotel in a superb location - we were hardly in our room anyway - would definately recommend. Shop around for best rates, we booked through ryanair and got a great deal.

<Content>Closedphobic The room was shabby, dark, no ventilation in bathroom, tiny window to the dirty narrow courtyard in the bedroom. We got closedphobic. Phone wasn't connected (complained but never replaced), fridge was locked up. When I asked for hair dryer, was told to pay 15 euros deposit! It was too expensive 220 euros per night and this state of the room + service. We asked manager to change the room, but they were not friendly, exchanged only 1 room out of our 2 rooms to the slightly better room with full of chemical smell which gave us headache. Also Lighting was not consistent, we had light suddenly shut at night and very inconvinient till we found the breaker. We did not like the hotel at all.

<Content>Great Location I have stayed at this hotel before and have to say that the new refurbished rooms are so much better.The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was nice however the shower wasn't very powerful. It also had trouble maintaining a constant temperature.The location is great, right in the middle of everything, and the staff were very helpful.My only issue was that we had a room on the 5th floor quite near the vending machine and for some reason everyone decided to use it on their way back from a night out! It can get quite tiresome being woken up at 2.00am (and 2.30am, and 3.00am.....). I think that you get what you pay for with this place, a reasonable hotel in a great location.

<Content>great location The Hotel was having major refubishments which it needs. Room was basic. Bed comfortable. Bathroom fresh and clean but shower cubicle tiny. Breakfast was better than the usual coffee and cold croissant. Staff were not overly friendly, but that's Barcelona, right? I would recommend it on it's cleanliness and it's great location to the main street Las Ramblas. Definately recommend the hop on,hop off bus tours around Barcelona.

<Content>Terrible room The location is very good but thats about that. Arriving we thought that it looked nice from outside and even from reception area but once we got to our room, we couldn`t believe our eyes. We had a very small room that didn`t even have a window in it, coupled with the fact that there was a dripping toilet and you could hear the slightest noise outside the room then we were far from happy considering the price they charged. Breakfast was acceptable.

<Content>nothing to complain about! I booked this hotel due to its superb location, once I arrived, contrary to some of the bad reviews I have read, I really liked the hotel. The rooms were clean and average size for a city hotel, and the breakfast was fine (much better than what i have experienced at some 4 and 5 star hotels in barcelona!) Everyone should stop complaining - what do they expect for the price they are paying! If you want jacuzzi baths and private butlers, stay at the Arts hotel by the beach, if you want to be in the centre and within a few minutes of all the good places, stay at the Rialto!

<Content>The Riatlot is improving! The Rialto is in a great location, you can walk everywhere in central Barcelona from the Hotel. The hotel is in the process of being refurbished, so there is some noise in the mornings from the building work. But all the rooms I saw have brand new doors, the rooms were clean, the room I was in had been freshly painted, it was a decent sized twin room, with a hall way and a bathroom, the towels were a bit thin, but the sheets were crisp and white. A number of people have complained that the rooms were dark, this is going to be true of many hotel rooms in cities in Spain, as many are built around very small internal courtyards, and this hotel is on a narrow street so many of the rooms are going to be dark. At 鈧?9 a night for a twin room I would recommend this hotel, it is clean and in an absolutely brilliant location. Oh and the breakfast is OK too!

<Content>Better than expected I stayed at the Rialto Hotel at the end of March with a group of friends. I didn't book the hotel myself and didn't actually ask where we were staying until the day before. When told I did a quick search on TripAdvisor and wasn't too impressed with the comments on there. As I was only staying for one night, I decided not to worry about it and concentrate on enjoying the rest of the visit. On arrival at the hotel, the staff were very nice, unlike the predictions on TripAdvisor. From then on the hotel was much better than anticipated. I had a single room which was very small, but perfectly adequate, with everything I needed. It was at the back of the hotel, so had no view and was a bit on the dark side, but at least that meant it was quiet and I wasn't going to spend much time there anyway. The room and bathroom were clean and the towels were better than your average hotel towels. The bed was comfortable, there was plenty of hot water and an extra pillow and blanket in the cupboard. Breakfast was fine if you avoided the cooked offerings and there was a good selection of food. This hotel is in a good central location. If you're looking for a budget hotel that's good value for money, this is great for a couple of nights's stay. I would use it again.

<Content>Much better than expected After the reviews below I wondered what on earth to expect but The Rialto was a pleasant surprise. The rooms were clean and reasonably decorated, if a little tired looking, and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was perfectly acceptable for a 3 star (4 types of cereals, yogurts, fruit the usual cheese/meats as well as the more English cooked choices). The location was excellent. It's not somewhere I'd want to stay for a holiday, but if you want a clean, basic hotel with a central location for a weekend stay, at a very reasonable price, The Rialto is hard to beat.

<Content>Stay Away!!! Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 4 nights in Mid March. Normally when I go for a city break I am not too fussed about the hotel, as long as it is clean and in a good location. This hotel was both clean and in an excellent location, but these are the only 2 good things I can say about it!! Our room was tiny, the bathroom door wouldn't close, and there were no tea/ coffee making facilities or hairdryer in the room as is advertised. That's just for starters! When we walked into the room first we thought the curtains must be closed as the room was so dark ... this was not the case! There was a balcony leading off the room overlooking an alleyway, hence the lack of light. So anytime we were in the room, day or night, we had to have the lights on. We came back to the room one afternoon to drop off some shopping and went to turn on the light only to discover that the electricity had gone in the room!!! As well as this, the hotel was being refurbished so we were woken up at 7 30 every morning to banging and drilling from below us. (This may suit some people, but we are a young couple who wanted to sample the night life of the city and be able to sleep it off the next morning!) So much for soundproof rooms!! We went to the hotel bar one night and were told at 10 30 that they had finished serving! (Luckily there are a couple of good irish bars down the road!) We found the staff to be generally rude and unhelpful and I would advise anyone thinking of booking this hotel to steer well clear!! As I said, I wouldn't have high expectations of buget hotels when I go on holidays but this was a joke!

<Content>BEWARE - Bell boy squeezing zit in elavator! We read the reviews for this hotel prior to our stay but didn't believe that the hotel could be that bad but it was! The location is fantastic and couldnt have been better but that was the only advantage to staying at this hotel. The hotel is run down and under construction. The elevator didnt work, the noise was unbearable, the staff were unhelpful and the bell boy came to our room to fix the toilet and used his mobile and squeezed his spots in the elevator on the way!!!!! The breakfast was not worth getting up for..................need we go on. If you need a central location and a bed for the night then this is the hotel for you but if you want more then stay away.

<Content>fantastic location This hotel is in a great location with easy access to all the main attractions of the city.The downside is the early morning noise from the streets below . Being in the centre the outlook from the rooms is very restricted and dark . Breakfasts are plentyful but the quality is not brilliant. Overall the hotel is in need of a makeover but what the heck ,in this location at this price no one can complain.

<Content>Good location;shame about the hotel! I stayed here for 3 nights in June 2006. The hotel is situated on a road just of the Ramblas - so easy access after a long night out!The rooms are very small and dark. I had no view from my window. Well, that's if you don't count a wall!I would not recoomend this hotel

<Content>Hotel Rialto review I went to Barcelona recently for my birthday and stayed at Hotel Rialto. I had read other reviews which stated that the location was excellent, and this was one of the main factors in choosing the hotel. The location, I found to be outstanding, as I had been informed by other travellers. The street which the hotel is on is right near Las Ramblas and is close to other attractions and shops.However, other aspects of the hotel were not quite as impressive. The hotel stated on the internet that hairdryers would be available. We found that this was only true if you were lucky, as there were only 2 hairdryers available for everyone in the hotel. We did not manage to obtain one.The rooms were very tatty and our TV and television did not work. We only stayed for 3 nights, any longer and I would have had to insist on moving.The staff were mainly rude - the bar closes at 11pm, which is very early anyway, but to add insult to injury, when we tried to order drinks at 10.40pm, the barmaid told us, about 5 times in her stony faced manner that the bar closed at 11. She then refused to serve poor soul who came in at 10.55, although this was still before the closing time.The breakfast was basic and every morning the fried eggs were stone cold. Other than all this, it was fine!! I would probably not stay again, as it was extremely basic and needs a thorough refurbishment. Its a shame as the location was superb.

<Content>Avoid at all costs Avoid this hotel at all costs. Yes it is in a great location but to be honest, there are a hundred other hotels also in this area which have to be of better standard than this hotel. Never have I encountered such rude staff. Iit seems that if you are British (as my fiance is) they will be rude and arrogant and unhelpful and will ignore you. Being Australian, I seemed to be able to get a little bit of helpfulness from the staff but not much too be honest. The hotel to be blunt, stinks of sewerage. This smell seems to be present on all floors the floors, in the two rooms we stayed in and even in the lift. I know Barcelona isn't renowned for having the best drainage system but this was so bad it left you feeling physically ill. After our first night we requested to change rooms after the room wehad had a broken shower head, broken mini bar, no tv reception, broken sink and cracks in the walls that left me in shock that the building was still standing. Our next room which appeared to be an upgrade was a bit better although the toilet seat was broken in half and you had to leave the windows open all the time to avoid being suffocated by the stench of the drains. All the rooms are smoking rooms even if you request a non smoking room although this tends to be a common problem in main land Europe.All in all, I have stayed in backpackers that are of higher standard and half the price. I would never return to this hotel and by no means could I recommend this hotel nor its staff to anyone.Avoid!

<Content>Wonderful City Break The is a Wonderful old Hotel in the Gothic side of Barcelona, 3 minute walk from the popular La Ramblas, 2 minutes from the Cathedral  15 minutes from the beach. Yes the rooms decor was showing signs of age but this only added to the gothic charm. Our rooms had balconies over the narrow street to soak in the atmosphere. Rooms were clean and tidy, most staff are bi-lingual and could not do enough to help. Our kids 18,13  5 enjoyed the stay. Good continental breakfast. Would Highly recommend.

<Content>Totally recommend this hotel!!! When i booked this hotel i was quite worried as i had read some not so good reviews!! but i arrived home from the rialto lastnite and i have to say that i had no complaints what so ever!!When we arrived the staff were very friendly and helpful and it only took us a few minutes to check in. The hotel room was a good size as there was three of us staying in the same room, but there was plenty of space!The only thing i will say is that when we walked past other rooms some of them did look on the small size but we obviously got one of the biggest because there was 3 of us. I suppose its the luck of the draw what room you are given, we stayed in room 428!The room was cleaned every day and new bedding, towels etc without fail!I would 100% recommend this hotel, it has lots going for it! Fantastic location, clean and friendly and the breakfast in the morning keeps you going until tea time!Its sort of down a little high street so when you are walking down there be extra careful for pickpockets beacuse i got my bag pinched off my arm just down the road!! but that could happen anywhere in barcelona!!Overall i rate this 10 out of 10!!

<Content>Fantastic Location for Las Ramblas We have just returned back from a long weekend away in Barcelona. We arrived late on 26th Jan 07 and departed on the 29th Jan 07. We booked this hotel on Hotels.com and got a reasonable price. The Hotel location was fantastic we was a 2 mins walk to Las Ramblas. On the same street as the hotel there was lovely cafes, patisserie and pubs. The recepition area was very nice and it has a lovely sit down area and we were checked in very quickly. The Rooms were quite small as soon as you walked through the door the bed was it front of you. The bathroom we had was a decent size and was clean. The room was cleaned everyday and we was given new towels as well. On the first night our room was unbearable hot even when we adjusted the temperature it would not cool down but the following nights after that it seemed to adjust and it was fine. My negative points is that they do not provide hairdryers which can be a nightmare for the ladies and an iron which i was totally suprised about as it is a 3* star hotel. The laundry service was only Monday-Friday which was no use to us. Also we experienced some noise around 8am in the morning of people banging away and talking really loudly so my advice is to get a high floor as we was on the first. Overall this hotel is perfect for the location with great access all around the city. The rooms are small and basic which had TV that only played spanish channels. There was additional cost for the use of the safe which is 2 EUR per day. The service was satisfactory but they did find it hard to understand english so practice some basic Catalan.

<Content>as we expected we wanted a good value hotel close to the Ramblas and that's exactly what we got. We stayed room only so can't comment on the food.The place is decaying a bit with the odd light fitting askew in the lobby, one of the elevators out of action, and the other one's handrail secured by a bit of wire. Reception staff were efficient but seemed a little disinterestedThe rooms were neat and clean and the plumbing mostly worked OK. Couldn't fault the maid service.Only 5 mins walk from the Ramblas.We were quite happy with our choice and thought it good value for money

<Content>Run from the Rialto!! As others have highlighted this hotel is in a great location unfortunatley the room was horrible and fully at odds with the plush reception. Our room was extremely small, dark (we had one of those wall facing views) with cracked walls, peeling paint, broken mini bar, broken toilet seat and dirty burnt bed covers. There was no hairdryer. It was just really shabby and run down and I wouldn't consider staying there again.

<Content>NOTHING IN THE HOTEL TOOK AWAY FROM THE BARCELONA EXPERIENCE I have just come back from a long week-end with a group of friends, only had a problem with one of the four rooms which was changed with no arguement. rest were fine, and clean, plumbing slightly ancient, get what you pay for. There is so much to see in barcelona therefore did not spend too much time in room so not bothered if the view out the window was not very good. For breakfast there was a lot of choice, although it sometimes took a while for an item that ran out to be replaced. Nothing about the hotel took away from the Barcelona experience so no major complaints. I doubt you could get a more central position with everything close to hand.

<Content>Great customer service We arrived at the Rialto at 5:00 a.m. on the day of check-in and were given a room early, which was great as we had been travelling the entire night. Unfortunately, the room had to have been the tiniest in the hotel as there was a double bed pushed against a wall and only about a foot of clearance around it on the one side and at the foot. The bathroom was a steep step down and small.I asked if it would be possible to change rooms since we would be staying for 6 nights and the desk clerk said that should be possible later in the day. (At that time, other people were also asking for room changes.)Later in the day, the clerk told us that there weren't any free rooms, but that we could stay at their 4 star sister hotel, the Gran Barcino, for the same price. It was only one block away and the room was spacious and quiet. I would not reserve a room at the Rialto again, but was greatly impressed by the degree of customer service. I definitely would book at the Gran Barcino.

<Content>Location, Location, Location I have just returned from a fantastic stag weekend in Barcelona, which owed a little to the accommodating staff and location of the hotel. If you are about to book this hotel you may want to take into account the type of hotel you are booking into that will take in a group of 23 (quite well behaved) lads. The reception staff at the hotel were fantastic, very informative, always eager to help and answer our questions. Our rooms were clean and comfortable, which were top priority for our brief recovery periods, however they were nothing like the pictures shown by the hotel. My room had small double balconies over looking a quiet side street which were a very nice, but most of the rooms we had allocated for us were dark with a single window looking out on to a brick wall. Breakfast at the hotel was very good. Good selection of hot and cold food, which runs from 07.30 - 10.00. Those of us that made breakfast, arrived at 09.50 to still find an ample amount of food, which was replenished until we had finished.Most impressive part about this hotel is the location. A one minute walk from La Rambla and good access to tains, buses and taxis.We all had a great weekend, but his is probably not the hotel for romantics or familes. Hope this helps!!

<Content>Can't believe the poor reviews I stayed at the Rialto back in 1999 and 2000 and said that if I went back to Barcelona I would certainly book there again. Well came 2006 and I decided on another visit and booked through my agent.After booking I looked through the review page nad was disappointed to see some of the comments and wondered if the Hotel had gone 'downhill'. I had no need to worry, the staff were helpful, the room although on the small size was adequate for our needs and the breakfast was far better than some better rated hotels I have been to. For the price of 拢40 a night Band B it was great value.It was clean, and it's siting was second to none. If I had a complaint it would be that during the few days I chose to go, Chelsea were playing Barcelona and the noise at night permeated everywhere. This is not the Hotels fault but it meant a rather sleepless night on the Tuesday.Overall, a good, clean, above average hotel with a great command of the city's features. Close to the Metro, Port, Ramblas, Placa Catalunya (where all day tours seem to start from).If I go back, I will certainly book there again (for the 4th time).

<Content>Moderate hotel with good location We have been in Hotel Rialto for the last week of September. Although the hotel has a great location, there were also some disadvantages:1. The rooms were not only small but also very dark. We couldn't understand the difference between the morning and the night.2. The furniture of the room was very very old. I can understand the historical building but the furnitures can be renewed.3. Unlike many hotels in the same category, there weren't a hairdryer in the room which can be a problem especially for ladies. I have seen many women in the breakfast with wet hair and angry face.4. I personally didn't like the breakfast very much. Maybe it is because the breakfast buffet was at the depressive basement of the building, without a window and air. 5. We have gone with my husband and couldn't get a frenchbed. Moreover, we had a terrible waist pain during the stay because of the state of the art beds.That's all. I hope these help you to choose.

<Content>Loved this hotel We had read the somewhat scathing reviews of this hotel prior to our visit and basically expected the worse. BUT we absolutely loved it.The location is perfect, the hot buffet breakfast excellent, all of the statt were polite and extremely helpful (always a smile and a hola) - nothing was too much trouble for them.Yes - the rooms are small, but lets face it, how long are you planning to spend in your room when you have this brilliant city to explore!!! and yes, the plumbing and decor were a little suspect, but this is the price you pay for a place with a bit of character!!Yes - the rooms have no view to speak of and we were subjected to a night or two of disturbed sleep due to rowdy party goers in the courtyard and street - but this is a large city and you have to reasonably expect some noise. Let's face it - you're on holiday and can stay in bed a little longer in the morning if you have to (and the breakfast is served up to 10:30 - so no problem !!!)If you want a modern, clinical hotel, don't stay here. If you want a great central location, great hot buffet breakfast, friendly and helpful staff and a bit of character - this is the place for you.We stayed for 5 very enjoyable nights and would have loved to stay longer. Would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>great location!!! great lobby!! the rialto is on 'calle ferran' one of the main shopping streets in barcelona and close to the subway stations, la rambla and many restaurants and bars. the room however was a disappointment. the phone did not work.the A/C did not work. i told them about it and they were prompt to try and fix it but it was not fixable so they moved me to another room. (with no help) the corridors were run down, carpet worn, paint peeling. small rooms.the suizo hotel was literally around the corner from the rialto and a much better deal. (both hotels were the same price) the room was bigger and nicer, bigger bathroom.both hotels are in a fabulous location and that being my main motivation- to be in the gothic quarter- i was happier with the suizo and would recommend it to thrifty travellers. for those wanting luxury-look elsewhere!!! still, a great location cannot be denied!!!

<Content>The worst hotel The rooms are poor, and their clients, are the worst, they play music iin the balconade past 12 o'clock at night, and the hotel says: I can say nothing. The clients, during the night are able to throw one stone against one neiborgh building, were people is sleeping, and the hotel says: I can do nothing. The drunk clients, can sing in front of the main door, and the hotel says: I can say nothig.So if your are clean, polite, and smart, and your family has teach your good manners this is not your hotel in Barcelona.

<Content>wonderful location, but hotel not recommended Just returned from a four-day trip to Barcelona.The Rialto hotel is on Carrer Ferran, in the heart of the Gothic quarter: a wonderful location with many restaurants and typical shops nearby. Rambla within 5 minutes walking distance, although I think this is not the best bit of Barcelona (still don't understand what everybody likes about this tourist trap).I know many trip advisor-members complain about the noise in the Rialto, especially when you have a room in the front of the hotel. Our room was on the 5th floor, so the noise was bearable. I thought I had been smart, bringing my ear plugs, but on the second day the room maid threw the little box (with plugs in it) away. I sometimes had the impression that the cleaning staff spent more time re-arranging our pajamas (putting them in odd, sexy shapes, like in the window of a fashion store) than actually cleaning.The room itself was shabby and worn-out: big parts of the paint had come off, due to - we think - moisture problems, the beds were very noisy (no further comment ;)), but worst of all was the bathroom: it was impossible to controll the temperature of the water: it went from very cold to very hot in no time, and vice versa, without touching anything. The water from the tap in the sink went in every direction but the sink, and for a shower two people were needed: the one that was taking the shower, and someone to constantly pull up the tap handle that controlls the switching between water coming out of the tap or out of the shower (if you released it, the shower stopped). I still wonder what anyone travelling alone would have to do to take a decent shower!The young people (students?) at the reception desk were friendly, the older man (manager?) was not friendly or helpful at all. Would I recommend Barcelona and the Gothic Quarter as a destination? Yes, yes, yes!!!Would I recommend this hotel? Since the only good part of it is the location: definitely not.Here is an extra tip for anyone driving to Barcelona and desperately in search of a parking place that doesn't ruin you: you can park without any cost on the streets in the former olympic village of Barcelona (around Avinguda Icaria). The reception-man wouldn't help us on this subject, but a very friendly girl in the tourist information center on Placa Ferran made this suggestion. We were of course very grateful and spent the saved money on a lovely tapas dinner! With Riojan wine, of course!

<Content>Great location, rooms on small side The location is great minutes from Las Ramblas. I found the staff polite and helpful. Good buffet breakfast. Rooms clean but the single room I had was very small with only a small window, but given the hotel's city location not that unusual. Plumbing was interesting, though I did have plenty of hot water. Would stay again purely due to location.

<Content>Not the best! This is a mixed review in so much as the location is a good  a bad thing. Good because only a minute away from Las Ramblas  Plaza mayor etc but it's right next to the town hall etc, so when we stayed there was some sort of demonstration going on and so the street right outside the Rialto was full of armed police and about 10 police vans.Lots of shouting  crowds, quite alarming!I went a 2nd time (not staying at the Rialto) and the local roller hockey! team had just won some championship, so again everyone congregated outside the town hall to welcome home the team, very noisy. Things like this happening are obviously not everyday occurences, just seem to happen when I'm there!The hotel itself was ok not great. We had rooms at the front which seemed great at first with a small balcony. Then night time came and the noise is unbelievable lots of noisy, people passing ALL night (no exaggeration)  also the bin men turned up about 3am.My room was ok, nothing special but the other room my friends were in absolutely reeked when they put the air conditioning on, so they just slowly melted at night!Even so, they said they would stay there again, I wouldn't ( haven't).

<Content>Excellent location, basic but clean and comfortable I stayed at this hotel mainly because of it's location and wasn't disapointed. It's got a fantastic position in the heart of the gothic quarter a few minutes from the Ramblas, plaza Catalunya and the port. The room was small and functional but very clean. The hotel was very busy and the breakfast was good. I would stay there again.

<Content>Good Choice Good location, spacious room.Ideal location for most of the attractions and shops and bars nearby.Breakfast is included, but sometimes we felt last nights dinner was being re-heated! Plenty of choice though.Would return.

<Content>rude staff I had a six days of holiday at the beginning of July and I stayed in Rialto Hotel.I arrived late at night after a delayed flight. When I came to the reception,there wasn't any welcome or hello, the staff were really very rude and indifferent.I was given a room on the sixth floor without a window!There was only a small piece of glass on the ceiling from which light came inside the room at 6 o'clock in the morning!Most of the nights,when I came back to my room,the door was locked and I had to go six floors down to take a card to open my door.When I asked the reason,they couldn't explain as most of the staff didn't know English well.They had the same unfriendly attitude in the restaurant where we were having breakfast.The only nice thing about Rialto is its location.It is very close to Las Ramblas. But still, I would definitely not stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Many problems... Elevators never worked. Neither did our room keys. Floors in our room were filthy. Showerheads were ancient and pitiful. View of a dirty alley. Beds did not look as if they were stripped daily. The only good thing I can say is that the staff was pleasant (except for an extremely rude host in the buffet area), and the area is convenient to everything.

<Content>Hotel Rialto I stayed in Hotel Rialto two weeks ago with my two daughters aged 14  5. The location is excellent, walking distance from Las Ramblas, La Boqueria, Cathedral, Darsenas Reales, Museum of History of the City and nice brasseries and shops. But the main problem is the room, it is hot and they told us the air conditioning system in the hotel is not activated until the month of June. We left on the 29th of May, so I guess that staying there now is not a problem. The breakfast buffet is very good and the personnel at the counter is courteous all the time. I'd stay there again but not in May.

<Content>Could be better 4 of us stayed at the Rialto in central Barca in march. Great location - couldn't be faulted for centralness to Las Ramblas and to the city in general.My room was excellent - overlooking the street with a small balcony, but my friends was dreadful with a window that was frosted glass with a view over the bins!For the price it was pretty good value but the hotel staff could be better. We couldn't get an extra pillow after 9pm on our first night as the cupboard is locked at 6pm!!cleanliness was of a good standard and the bar in the cellar was cosy.

<Content>Ideal position Excellent location between Cathedral (200m) and the famous Rambla(500m) yet in safe quieter side street. Take rooms on side or rear. Tourist class accomodation but adequate. My twin room was small for two and air conditioning barely adequate. Staff neither gushing nor aloof. Breakfast at 12 euros is pricey for what is available better to pop out to local cafe.Bathroom tired and towels grey! but clean and fresh.For the money I recommend this because of it position and has all the things needed.Note pedestrian area of the Rambla means in the evening taxis cannot approach and a walk may be required.

<Content>Great Location I have stayed at the Rialto four times, so I must like it. It is ideal for the Ramblas, the Barrio Gothic which includes the cathedral and the many little alleyways that need to be explored. It is only a short walk to Liceu Metro station on the Ramblas and not much further to the Placa de Catalunya where you can get the bus too and from the airport. There are superb late night bars in the area but the prices are becoming more and more expensive. Back to the hotel, the reception is very nice and the rooms are clean and tidy but the corridors are a maze, but easy when you've done it once providing you are sober. On my last visit in December 2004, we were on the first floor (can't recall the room number) and when we went into the room for a late afternoon siesta before the night ahead, I couldn't rest for what turned out to be a ghetto blaster in the shop below. It was nothing to do with the hotel and was in a clothes shop two doors to the right of the main entrance when you look at it from the street. I have stayed at other places in Barcelona and paid a lot more money but been less satisfied. For me, this is reasonably priced and in the best area you can get, but don't expect perfection. It is very clean and I would recommend you try it unless you are very rich and want a first class hotel.

<Content>Great little place in the center of it all We absolutely loved Barcelona and Hotel Rialto was a good base for us. It was a bit smaller than the other hotels that we stayed in the region, but it was well kept and the people were friendly. I also felt very safe, as the hotel was in a nice area.

<Content>Great location, a good value hotel This hotel is ideally situated for exploring Barcelona. Our room was immaculate and the staff were friendly. The rooms were very reasonably priced. The only downside is that it is noisy at night- however, that's a small price to pay to be in the heart of the city.

<Content>Great location, good value Stayed here Nov. 2-5 and Nov. 15-17. Great location near Ramblas, the Cathedral, 2 different Metros, etc. The rooms vary from in need of upgrading (our first stay) to  nicely furnished. On both occasions, we requested and got a room in the interior. Since this hotel is in fact a combination of 3-4 different buildings linked curiously together, it is quite possible to get one of the better rooms or not. The staff was both friendly AND helpful; most everyone spoke English, but they appreciate our fairly successful attempts at Castellano. We got an excellent bargain on Orbitz: 80 Euros + tax as compared to the 120-15- rack rate. This is certainly not luxury, but the value allows you to eat at any of the really excellent restaurants nearby without feeling pinched. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Noisy and Dangerous The public areas were ok but our room on the 5th floor was dirty, run down and noisy. Also very dangerous as a railing from the balcony was missing leaving a large gap that even an adult could fall through. School group on our floor kept us awake until 4am. Many guest's also complained but were ignored, would not recomend it to any one.

<Content>Good location, but noisy Spent four nights here in October. We were traveling with a tour group that has used this hotel many times before. On the plus side, the location of the Rialto is fantastic for a first-time visitor -- just off Las Ramblas and on the edge of the Gothic Quarter, and there's a metro stop close by. The buffet breakfast is good. The rooms were clean. And the beds are better than they sometimes are in Spanish hotels -- still small, but comfortable. On the negative side, the noise from the street at night was pretty bad. The staff is best described as wary. The room was small and needed renovating. Our room didn't exhibit the notorious pong, but other people in our group said that theirs did. On the whole, if you just need a bed and a good breakfast, this place is fine. If you're a light sleeper, or if the quality of your room is important, you may want to try somewhere else. Oh, and the hotel's claim to be able to provide hair dryers was sadly false (unless they had just one and it was out when I needed it).

<Content>All my stuff stolen from my locked room-no forced entry I checked in this hotel close to midnight, nipped out for a drink and some tapas, came back to find my room had been broken into (with a key, no forced entry) and everything I owned was stolen - cash, credit cards, camera equipment (too large for safe), driving licence, mobile phones, keys etc etc. In hindsight, obviously we should have rented a safe from reception but a lot of my equipment was too large to do this anyway. Obviously an inside job as there was no forced entry and the burglar must have been in the room a long time as the valuable stuff was very well hidden. The hotel apologised and the police were helpful but I was very annoyed no-one was willing to check the CCTV. So anybody visiting the Rialto - BEWARE and don't leave anything at all in your rooms.........

<Content>Loved the Rialto After booking this hotel I was a bit worried after reading some of the other reviews. I needn't have been. Myself and two friends stayed there for 3 nights 14th October. We had a lovely quiet triple room with air conditioning and a spacious bathroom. The staff on reception couldn't be more helpful or friendly, and the staff in the restaurant were helpful with a good sense of humour! On our first night we needed more pillows, so we asked at reception and when we returned to our room there they were. We also had plenty of hot water! I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, it was centrally positioned for La Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter and we couldn't have asked for more.

<Content>Brilliant location!! Stayed here for 2 nights in September and thought it was great value for money. Also you couldnt ask for a better location- a few mins walk from las ramblas.Wasnt that keen on breakfast though there was plenty to choose from. Unfortunately the person i went with was a bit of a moaning michael, his flip flops hurt etc etc but overall a gorgeous city and a fab hotel!!

<Content>Good Hotel,Fantastic Location Fantastic location, walking distance about 1 min from la rambla and everywhere else within easy reach. Buffet breakfast was great,huge choice of everything and was included in room price (拢70 for twin room). Bathroom was good size and had twin basins, very handy. No probs whatsoever with hot water, hot day and night. The room didn't have much natural light and was a bit on the small side but who cares for all the time you're in it! Overall a very pleasant stay, would stay here again and would definately recommend it for the cost and location.

<Content>Loud, not very clean, felt a bit unsafe Not very impressed with this hotel. The lobby is quite impressive but after that, its just an old rundown looking hotel. The elevators didn't work for half of our stay so we had to climb up and down from the 5th floor. The doors were so thin that we heard every single person walking down the hallway, maid carts rolling around, etc. Windows not double glazed so noise from the outside street travelled right up to our room. Bathroom had mystery hairs in it. Towels very thin. Door had one tiny doorknob lock, no deadbolt, etc etc and we had to pay 2 euro/night for rental of the safe key (may be a common practice in europe, i'm just not familiar with it). Would not stay there again, for sure. Breakfast is NOT included as it was at every other european hotel we travelled to.

<Content>VFM Stayed 3 nights April 13 thro to 17th,拢70 per/night.Absolutely no problems,17 Euros by Taxi from Airport.Staff very helpful, room worth the money because I've paid more in other Cities,you would do well to find anywhere better located.Hot water ok, didn't try the air/conn.Try and get room away from the front as it can still be quite noisy.Would have been nice if there had been some brew equipment in the room,will take a travel kettle on my next visit and would definately stay here again.

<Content>Hmmm.....Okay but not the best we've been to in Barcelona....! Ok.... like others, after reading the reviews we were a little nervous but prepared to be open minded. We've been to Barcelona before. I'd asked for a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony which afforded a great view, but came at a price.in terms of noise....dustbin men around 3am etc. Very narrow streets make for lots of echoes....! The Celtic fans didn't help either... we were near many of the irish bars....The room was very small - I had to walk sideways to get into bed... there was a large crack down the wall as well. The bathroom was so small that when I sat on the loo, I could have brushed my teeth at the sink in front of me... Had hot water though - no problems there. There was an incredibly strong drains smell in the toilet - there's a drain in the middle of the floor for cleaning and I'm not sure if that's where it came from. For those that have visited Barca before, it's aroma is just one of those things you learn to expect, but to have it lurking in your bathroom is not pleasant. We had to keep the toilet door closed when not in use else it became overpowering. We had to keep the windows closed at night in a feeble attempt to stop some of the noise - it doesn't work. Our room was not soundproofed - either windows or the walls either side. The air conditioning was fine when it worked, but kept causing the circuit breaker to kick in.... not sure why at all! We had to fix our toilet to stop it continuously filling. Bed linens changed daily IF you remember to put the card saying 'please make up my room' on your door. We didn't have one of these to begin with, and were not told to do this, therefore causing a run in with the maid, the housekeeper and the reception manager who tried to say it was our fault for not doing what we should have. I pointed out that a) if we had a card it would be useful, and b) who was supposed to tell us this rule! It was sorted promptly once they proved we had no card in the room. Breakfast is full of choice, but I had problems with the cold milk tasting sour every day.... which was odd as the hot milk didn't. The bar is very friendly and remarkably cheap! Carmen is a gem! We had no problems with staff attitude at reception (apart from the misunderstanding re room cleaning!). Overall, the hotel reminded me of hotels in London - a little faceless, dealing with many nationalities and a little tired. We paid 脗拢70 for the room per night including breakfast. Final advice if you've booked - take an air freshner and ear plugs just in case:-)

<Content>Don't worry - be happy! Have just spent a three night break at the Rialto and was surprised and delighted at the room, staff and excellent breakfast. Room more than adequate, bathroom very good and towels changed each day. Beds comfortable. All very clean. Breakfast excellent and staff all courteous and very helpful. Don't worryabout staying here. Will be going back.

<Content>Great Location Don't know what the fuss is about above average 3* with excellent location. Bar in hotel quite quiet so consequently staff appear miserable. Lots of cafes, bars  restaurants nearby. Very nice upmarket wine bar type establishment next door. About 2 min walk to La Rambla. Rooms tend to be average size but without views - the windows tend to overlook enclosed courtyards and consequently the rooms are quite dark. If you've got breakfast booked its a buffet style so something for everyone if not probably not worth 11euros

<Content>Stay here it's OK This hotel is OK:VERY well located,brilliant buffet breakfast and more than adequate quad room.Nice and clean and linens changed daily.Only prob was a bit of noise at night but you must expect that in central city.Beggers?If you don't want to see beggars,ripoffs,pickpockets,and street thieves stay at home-certainly stay away from London,which has a much nastier atmosphere than Barca!

<Content>Don't believe all the bad reviews! We found this review website the day before departure, which left us extremely apprehensive. Needn't have been. Stayed for 3 nights in January 2004. Room cleaned every day, including a change of bedding. Plentifull hot water 24 hours a day even though hotel was fuly occupied. The air-con worked and we found all staff very friendly and willing to help where possible. There were beggars in the area (like any major city) but this was more than made up for by the hotel's excellent location. I would suggest it depends on your expectations, as to whether you will be dissapointed. We arrived expecting the worst and were pleasantly surpised. Definitely not a 4*, but a justified 2-3*. Lets face it, you don't visit Barcelona to stay in your hotel room for the whole vacation. We would happily recommend this hotel to anyone travelling on an average sized budget.

<Content>I enjoyed my stay at the Rialto! Terrific Location! At first I was uneasy about staying here after reading the reviews, but I got a good deal so I couldn't resist trying it out. It definitely is not a 4* hotel, however the location is wonderful! It is walking distance to Las Ramblas and the Cathedral! Perfect location for a day of walking and sightseeing.

<Content>Wouldn't stay again Thought as it stated it was a 4* it was a pretty safe bet - how wrong.... The reception/lounge was quite nice, however the reetionist obviously don't like their jobs, the room which was a reasonable size, had leaks in the bathroom from the room above - i means lots of water through the lights, the sound proofed rooms - i don't think so, everytime any of the nearbye rooms used the toliet or shower, you might aswell of gone with them, i was REALLY quite bad, we had a view of a 2 foot square patio (room 114) with no sunlight atall, so waking at 10am in darkness is quite surreal!! The only good thing is the location, however there were a lot of beggars and druggies sleeping outside the hotel which greet you and walk with you up the street daily. There were a lot of other hotels nearbye that looked much better value, this is not worth the money!

<Content>OK, but certainly not great! Four of us stayed at the Rialto for three nights in November. Our room was fine but we asked to move as there was no opening window and the room was very stuffy - what a mistake! The next room was awful. Water was either scolding hot or not warm enough for a shower, the bathroom was minute, the wardrobe doors couldn't open as there wasn't enough room, the extraction in the bathroom wasn't working at all ..... the list goes on. We did tell them when we left but the receptionist said some of the rooms had been modernised, some not. Obviously this one was a NOT. Our friends were perfectly happy. Maid service was good, but staff overall not very friendly. VERY well situated though noisy at night.

<Content>Don't believe all you read I have read reviews and can't believe some of the bad comments.We stayed in the quad room which was basic but clean and beds were changed every day. Cleaner even folded up all our clothes and laid them out. We found all staff friendly and the lady serving in the bar was wonderful with the children. What a lovely friendly hotel in a great location.

<Content>It was fine! We were a bit nervous about staying at this hotel having read the reviews, but shouldn't have been. Staff at reception were friendly and efficient when we checked in. Our room was clean, and adequately furnished. It looked over a side street and onto part of the hotel and was consequently very quiet. It was quite cool in Barcelona so can't comment whether the air con worked or not. As for the bathroom-there was plenty hot water, but there was a bit of a drain smell (we noticed this throughout Barcelona over the weekend so perhaps it is not peculiar to this hotel). Breakfast was plentiful and a lot of choice. All in all, this is a very central hotel-and even if not 5 star luxury, who cares when you hardly spend any time in it, given that there is so much to see and do in Barcelona.

<Content>Please don't stay here I stayed at the hotel for two nights only. This hotel was supposed to be a three star hotel but I have stayed in better hostels. There wasn't any hot water, wasn't soundproofed, didn't have satellite or piped music and didn't include breakfast (as stated on your website). We put a 'Do not disturb' sign on the door and the cleaner still came into our room. The room was also riddled with damp and the bathroom stank. I cannot believe that I was charged 140 Euros per night to stay in this hotel. It completely ruined my holiday and feel I don't ever want to go to Barcelona again.

<Content>We loved it We also stayed in the Hotel Rialto, booked through our travel agency in Berlin. And when I read the reviews before, I thought 'Oh God, where will be staying'. This sounded all so bad. But somehow, we seem to have visited a completely different Hotel Rialto.All the people we had to deal with, spoke English, some even a few words German and they were all very, very nice. The room was to the side, away from the street, looking to another room on the other side. But it didn't matter, we were exploring the city most of the time. The a/c was working, although we didn't need it. We prefer to open the windows and let the air in, what we did, we even left the windows open throuh the night. We also always had hot water. I almost burned myself once and we got new towels and bed sheets every day.The breakfeast was good. Two different juices (tomate and mixed fruits, just great), four different kind of breads, joghurt, eggs, fried eggs, salami, two different kinds of ham, cheese, spanish salami and a kind of spread as well as sausages and maccaroni, marmelade. You could choose between hot and cold milk, tea, ice-tea and coffee. There was also fresh fruit salad, cereals and fruits to eat. At least was this the offer at 08:30 in the morning.When you look at the price for the room (62 Euro per person, which we paid, incl. breakfast), then I have to say, it's a price you have to pay in this category in the very center of a capital city. Compared with Berlin, it's just what I have expected to be. We really liked it, especially the closeness to the Ramblas and everything else we wanted to explore. We know, we will be going to Barcelona again and the hotel we will booking will be the Rialto.

<Content>The bad side of Barcelona The hotel is fantastically located and the reception area is very welcoming, but frankly these are the only positive attributes to this hotel. Most of the receptionists could not speak English, our bathroom stank and the corridor looked like something off The Amityville Horror. This hotel is crying out for desperate refurbishment. We gave up on breakfast after the third day. All you get is a concoction of greasy sausages, some chorizo ham and if you are lucky some ham and cheese. Even the orange juice tasted horrible. Avoid like the plague.

<Content>Pretty average The price was right and the location excellent, but the room pretty basic, and the electronic fire door outside our room broke on the first day of our visit which resulted in us listening to it open and close for the remains of our trip. The hotel is run down once you are past the renovated reception area.

<Content>i wouldn't stay here again! This hotel was disappointing. Rooms were small, dingy (window that looks out onto a concrete wall inches away!), very dated and basically just shabby. Not really clean, but just looked worn. Beds seemed very old - as did all the furniture - and weren't comfortable. Staff were bordering on rude, certainly not as helpful as they could have been. Breakfast was ok. Tap water from the shower was brown! I wouldn't stay here again. It's not a cheap hotel - I think we paid about 拢105 a night for a triple room, but it wasn't worth it. On the plus side.. the location is superb and the reception area looks really nice. Can't really say anything else good about it..

<Content>Stay Away  Stay away from this hotel. The other reviews were correct. I had to change rooms twice b/c there was no air-conditioning. The staff was not helpful. They just said that there is nothing they can do about it-that other rooms were experiencing the same problems. The lobby was actually cooler than the room itself. I spent one night just sitting in the lobby b/c the room was too hot.

<Content>Do Not Stay Here I too had a really bad experience here. Although the location was convenient, there are other hotels within walking distance that were alot better. I checked out after the first night stay. I found another hotel just down the road, 10 Euros less and alot more comfortable and the staff were alot more friendly. My room was small, the bed was not comfortable, and of course NO hot water. And don't forget, NO AC. After a long day of sight-seeing, you want to go back to your hotel room that you paid over 100 Euro with AC. No luck! Noisy. My little window looks out to other buidings. I'm extremely surpised at other positive feedbacks. Don't be deceived by those positive feedbacks fellow traverlers. Happy Traveling.

<Content>Great location for a tired hotel The location of the hotel is faultless, only a minute away from Las Ramblas and a minute away from the Barri Gottico.The rooms are small clean but could do with some serious refurbishment.Breakfast was OK.Barcelona is great with loads of places to watch the world go by whilst drinking a nice cold beer, I would suggest having some tapas at the Bilbao Berrio bar at the top of the Barri Gottic square.

<Content>Most Enjoyable Just back from an excellent 3 night stay at the rialto - 1 night with no air conditioning, but then we were out so late eating and drinking it didn't really matter. We would recommend the hotel to anyone, particularly with its perfect position. Our only problem was we didn't stay longer.
