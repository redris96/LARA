<Content>Intercontinental Dallas is NOT a 4 Star Hotel When we arrived, the lobby seemed nice and the lady working at the front desk was great. We took the outdated elevator up to our room where we discoved hair in the beds...Yuck! They switched us to another room where everything was dirty (floors, pillowcases, bedding). They switched us to another room that was less dirty, but not clean. They did a poor job remodeling all of the guests rooms, and the beds were very uncomfortable. I have traveled all over the world, and this hotel is NOT a four star hotel. I think a 2 1/2 star rating is more appropriate. If you are looking for a nice place to stay near the Galleria in Dallas, find somewhere else!

<Content>Wonderful experience! We spent 4 wonderful days at the Intercontinental- Dallas. The staff was very friendly and helpful;our room was really cozy with an amazing view. And the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!Around the hotel there are some really good restaurants and shops,all within walking distance.I would highly recommend this hotel as it is located in a very modern area.I will definately stay here next time I'm in town!

<Content>The review to read!! I booked this room for my boyfriends b-day through priceline and only paid $79!.I was surprised when the rate was excepted. I was also skeptical because I have read in the past that priceline's customers may get the crappy rooms in a hotel, but this was quite the opposite. I will start from the beginning:1. Parking- Outside parking was not a big deal for us. We always seemed to find a spot. Even though we may have had to drive around once or twice. There is garage parking available but it costs either $10 or $15 so I did the free parking2. Lobby- Usual 4 star lobby with all the marble and granite. Very nice but the ballrooms were showing its age a little bit.3.Elevators-Kinda small for such a big hotel and some of them smelled like feet. Good thing it was a short ride! On the plus side, there was a lot of elevators so the wait time was very short if any wait time at all.4. Room- Very clean and adequately equipped for business and pleasure. The one thing that ticks me off with these 4 star hotels are the TV's. The room would be so much nicer with a 32 LCD instead of the customary 27 bubble screen. We stayed on the 12th floor so at night the city was lit and it was kinda nice. There was also a minibar, but beware...the prices are downright crazy! they have regular size kit-kats for $2.50. The beds were also kinda hard...usually hotel beds should be plush....but it was okay. Room service was great! We had pizza and tortilla soup. The food was excellent but the prices were ridiculous!. It was $28! They add in their own 15% gratutity. Also if you look online, the rooms look the exact way so it was good there were no surprises.5.Bathroom- Kinda small but had nice counter space. The shower head was kinda weak, but it still did its job.6. Area attractions-Was near to all types of restaurants and shopping, movie theatre etc..only a five minute drive.Overall I would give this hotel a 3.5. They would get a 4 if the beds were softer and they had better tv's. I checked online and the regular rate is $199. I think that they are stretching it a lot. The most I would pay in Dallas is $120 and even thats stretching it a bit!

<Content>Pricelined the Hotel We were only here for one night and basically stayed in the room and left. I pricelined this hotel and was kind of weary as the reviews weren't great. The location is about 10 minutes from the Galleria and 20 form downtown. Beltline has alot of restaurants and shops so if you want to stay close there are plenty of places to eat and drink. The check in was fast and the attendant was nice. Our room was on the 10th floor and was pretty nice. I had no problem with bedbugs or the bed being too hard. The room was clean and pretty large. We had a King room and the robe was a nice touch. We checked out at 11:30 and there was no line and no issue with the attendant. She was in training and seemed to be nice. I would stay here again.

<Content>Pretty nice experience To be honest, after reading some of the reviews, I was a little worried about staying here. We were booked as a group for a family function. I thought, overall, we had a good experience. Really liked the health club that had good machines and weights. The room was attractive, although the bed was a bit hard for my tastes. Service was generally excellent. One day our room was not made up until the late afternoon, but I know that can happen sometimes. Prices in gift shop were over the top, but it was convenient to other shopping (loved the Galleria), so that wasn't too bad a problem.

<Content>Wouldn't Stay There Again The hotel has been renovated however they should have spent some of the money on quaility beds rather than the marble and granite in the lobby. I don't sleep in the lobby!! The beds were terrible and our air unit made a sound like someone hitting a drum when it was on, which kept us awake. It looks to me like when they renovated all they were concerned with was aesthetics, not the important part like central h/a and quality beds. The lobby: 4 star hotel, Rooms: not more than a 2 1/2 star.

<Content>Not what I expected I think the 4 star rating should be reviewed. I have stayed at enough 4 star hotels to know this is not comparable. Where do I start, the room decor was modern, they've done a great job except they left the bed alone. My bed was rock solid and was very uncomfortable. It seemed the walls were paper thin, we heard everything our neighbors were saying. The staff was great until departure day. The front counter staff was a bit stuffy. Customer service with a smile has not been implemented. Room service was overpriced for the quality of food that you get. I'm not sure I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Never Again! I was there for a meeting from Fri-Sun. I had bug bites from my stay, I paid for internet service and had to wait 2hrs for them to bring new cables because the ones in the room didn't work, and that isn't the worst of it. I went up to my room to get my credit card out of my purse and found that the room had been cleaned and my purse as well. My bank card was sticking half out of my purse, a few other cards were out of place and money was missing. I reported this to security who said they would investigate I had to cancel my bank card, credit cards, and checks. Over a week later I have not been compensated in any way....not even the money that was stolen. and they haven't even returned my calls. They refuse to provide me with a report of the incident and have not shown me that anything has been done. Do not leave anything in your rooms!

<Content>Here for Conference Was recently here for a conference with over 650 attendees. Nice place, showing its age a little bit.Guest rooms were dark, needed more light and drawer space.Good service in hotel, shuttles and valets could have been more helpful...they should have expected our group making it busy there.

<Content>Comfortable, Attractive, Recommended for North Dallas (Addison) Stayed at the InterContinental Dallas in September 2008 in connection with a conference. Room was large, comfortable, attractive and well-appointed. Bath was spacious. Property was clean and well-priced. Numerous dining options are within a short drive. Property seems well-managed and pricing (at least at the rate associated with my conference) was excellent. If you have reason to be in North Dallas/Addison, this property is an excellent choice.

<Content>Does not live up to Intercontinental expectations Having stayed at the Intercontinental hotels in Paris and Amsterdam, this hotel does not have the same standards. We payed for a club room which gives you access to the 15th floor lounge and bar and happy hour. When we went to get a drink, during the allotted time, the place was deserted the bar was closed and there were no staff around to question about this. You are also supposed to be able to get breakfast there.The pool area although nice and of a good size had no umbrellas to provide any shade and as the temperature was in the 90's/100's this was very disappointing. The seating around the pool had no soft cushions so you had to sit on the metal/wrought iron, which was uncomfortable.Having chosen this hotel specifically because it had a pool and wanting to relax there I was very disappointed. I will not be returning there. One saving grace, breakfast was excellent, and the evening meal in the restaurant was good.

<Content>Good hotel, problem with a burger I stayed here after a Red River Shootout, and it was good. The room was cozy and it was easy to access. My only problem is that they toast the buns to their burgers, and it's a little crunchy on the outer edge, which I don't like. Otherwise, it was a nice night for me.

<Content>Really Enjoyed It Except for the Bug Bites! I stayed at the Intercontinental with almost a thousand other guests for an in house conference. The staff and services provided by the hotel were top notch. Any request to the concierge, front desk, etc., was immediately responded to, and room service was punctual and very polite. The facilities were lovely, and appeared to be quite clean. However, after the first night, I noticed what I thought would be a few mosquito bites on my hands and arms. By the time of check out, I had 12 plus strange looking bites on my arms and back. I was either bitten by spiders or bedbugs while staying here. They are definitely not mosquito bites. Very disappointing and gross considering how nice everything else was. If I return to the Dallas area, I will pass on the Intercontinental.

<Content>If you like to sleep, stay somewhere else I used Priceline and got a pretty good rate for 3 nights. We had 3 adults and one teenager. The room was nice, but very small. The beds were the major problem. They were hard and tiny. Motel 6 has better quality beds! After the second night of next to no sleep, we checked out. My 16 year old daughter who is in great shape began walking like a 90 year old woman, complaining that her back and hips were killing her. I thought it was just us adults in pain, after I saw her walking like that we ate our 3rd and final night. We did not care that we wasted more than $100 on that last night, we just needed a soft place to sleep!!!! We opted for Radisson in Ft. Worth for our last night there.

<Content>No complaints I stayed at this hotel recently for 6 nights. I was very happy with my stay. The staff were all very pleasant, and I thought my room was very nice and well appointed. I was really impressed with the fitness room--one of the largest and best that I've ever stayed in. There were 4 treadmills, various weight machines, stair climbers, a few bikes.The only thing I didn't like was that the prices in the Monte Carlo restaurant seemed a bit high. I ate at surrounding restaurants to save money. There is also Rim's cafe (Starbucks) on the lobby level which does serve a little food for much cheaper than the Monte Carlo.

<Content>Enjoyable Stay I stayed three nights and had no complaints. It was clean and the staff was very friendly from beginning to end. When you call housekeeping you get a quick and satisfactory response. If you are not quite ready for prime time yourself, try Ervey in the salon downstairs. He is excellent in taking care of men and women. The business convention I attended there went very smoothly and the amenities were excellent, with one exception. The rest rooms on the Ballroom floor had no hot water at the sinks.

<Content>Good place to stay We enjoyed our stay. I see why some people think the place is dated, but I don't know if I would have noticed if I hadn't read the previous reviews. The room was very clean and looked like it was newly remodeled and decorated. We loved the breakfast. Instead of trying the buffet, we ate the espresso oatmeal and the Tex Mex Eggs Benedict. They were both very good. I don't usually drink coffee, but for some reason I ordered it this time and really enjoyed it. My wife who drinks coffee all the time agreed that it was very good coffee. The waitress said that everyone likes it, and it is Douwe Egbert brand. As far as parking goes, self-parking is available on the south side of the building if you prefer it. If you drive up to the east entrance, you will be greeted by a doorman offering to help you with your luggage and park your car.

<Content>Nice Hotel For Good Price I stayed here over the past weekend for just a get away with my wife and for some Christmas shopping in Dallas. I booked the Hotel through priceline and got a great rate of $65/night; you will pay that much for a Motel 6 or Days Inn if you travel much. I was skeptical after I read some of the reviews online but i was presently surprised to find the experience above average to excellent. When I checked in I was greeted by a nice gentleman at the desk and he had my reservation in order. I received a non smoking room with a king size bed in a newely remodeled room. Some have said they had to ask for the room but mine was provided with no special requests or additional charges. The room was a little warm for me and the air was not the most effiecient but by no means was it uncomfortable; I did mention this to the frontdesk after our first night and they fixed the problem or offered to move me to another room. The parking on the other hand was less to be desired; Alot of Christmas parties were going on so parking was very difficult at best.

<Content>Nice Hotel Good Location I recently stayed at the Intercontinental on business for one night. It was a very nice hotel - the room and all public areas were very nicely decorated and clean. The price was $199 per night which seems kind of high for suburban Dallas. I had the breakfast buffet in the morning which was not that good and not worth the price. The location is good for Addison - walking distance to many restaurants. I also think that the only computer for public use is in the lobby and I had to wait in line and also get someone behind the desk to get the boarding pass that I had printed. I will definitely stay here again if I am in the area.

<Content>You got me this time, but not again... Got a $97 priceline rate which was not bad for a busy Dallas weekend. We were in the last room on our floor which was the farthest from the elevator. This has happened to me before when booking with priceline and I can't help but think that is their way of getting back at travelers that want a cheaper rate. We were terrified to come back to our room after being gone all day to find that our room was open! They had either come in to clean and check the mini bar and our door was propped open. Thank goodness nothing was missing, probably because no one would walk that far to steal something from our room. When we brought it to the managments attention, they were not interested, we kind of got a shrug of the shoulders and a oh well. We were disappointed and we won't visiting there again. The best part about the hotel was the rate we got through priceline and the valet staff. Good luck!

<Content>Fine for the price We recently got a rate of $66.00 per night through hotwire, and stayed 2 nights. The hotel lobby was a bit outdated, but the rooms were very nice. The had all of the amentites of a 4 star hotel, but, the overall feel was about a 3 and 1/2. The location was excellent, right off of the tollway, just north of the Galleria. For the same price, I would stay at this property again. You can barely get a Motel 6 in Dallas, Tx for $66.00. Had I paid the rack rate of $189 and up, I would not have been pleased.

<Content>Very Satisfied w/Stay Originally booked for one night (of a 4-night trip) on Priceline for less than $70/night. After seeing reviews was concerned about what I'd find, but was very happy with what I found when I arrived.The room was very spacious and had clearly been remodeled recently. (I did request a renovated room based on earlier reviews.) It must have been a slow week because I was able to get the same rate for the rest of my stay, making the total for 4 nights less than $300. Compared to the normal $230+ nightly rate, I couldn't have been happier.Read some comments on parking...I parked on the side for free and was quite happy with it. Even when I got back late at night and had to park farther away, it wasn't that bad.The lobby bar prices were too high and I don't like paying for wi-fi access...that was the big negative.Very close to a ton of restaurants in Addison.I will DEFINITELY be trying to score this hotel on Priceline again soon. (I don't think there are that many 4-star hotels in the Galleria area.)

<Content>worst hotel stay ever We booked a two bed non-smoking room. When we arrived the front desk clerk was very friendly and gave me my room key. When I arrived up in the room it smelled like a bar and there was only one bed. I phoned the front desk and they told me they would get us a differant room that was non-smoking but they were not going to give us two beds. So there was 2 adults and 2 children in one bed . I was told for a 35.00 dollar charge we could have a rollaway bed. The parking was the most ridiciolous thing I have ever experienced. My parents just retired to Texas so we will be traveling there at least twice a year and I would never stay here again.

<Content>Worst 4 star I have ever stayed in! We stayed at the Intercontinental Dallas for 4 days inJune 2006, and there were numerous problems from start to finish. The staff seemed mostly foriegn (which is fine), but their grasp of English was so poor that they could not understand or correctly answer simple questions (like, Where is the business center? and one referred to my female friend as Sir,' and she is quite clearly a woman). The hotel room had a problem with the bath, and they were not quick to fix it. There were other issues I cannot recall now, but the overall feeling was that something amiss happened every day of our stay there.

<Content>Lacking in the Housekeeping Dept  Just returned from a weekend at this propertyGreat Price on Priceline.....that's where the good ends (except for the room service).1. Property should really be downgraded to 3 or 3.5 stars; this is by no means a 4 star property.2. Housekeeping services left much to be desired, especially given the wonderful reputation that the InterContinental line has.-hair in the sink, bathtub and all over the ceiling vent in the bathroom-multiple stains on the comforter and pillow cases-some of the bathroom towels had interesting stains on them as well-drinking glasses unwashed and unusable3. Upon notifing management of our concerns, we were advised that there was not much they could do because of our already discounted rate from Priceline.4. It does appear that they have a bias against Priceline customers....maybe they have a block of rooms for only Priceline customers that are not of the same quality/upkeep?5. Lounge is terrible. Furniture is very dated and worn. Bar and service were unacceptable.6. Room service (we ordered twice) was surprising good! That was the high note of our stay.

<Content>Awesome, awesome service I just attended a meeting at this hotel and all I can say is, What an amazing staff!!!! Everytime I turned around there was a staff member there to answer my question or help me with something. I don't know whether it was GREAT hiring and training or simply good ole' Texas hospitality, but they know how to treat their guests!As a side note, don't let the decor of the lobby ruin your opinion of this hotel - the guestrooms have just been renovated and are fabulous.

<Content>Nicely renovated rooms Stayed at the hotel on a business trip for 2 nights, receiving a corporate discount from the company we were meeting with. There are MANY hotel options in the Galleria area, but this hotel was very nice. You can tell by the look of the lobby that it has been there a while (remnants of 70's decor). However, the rooms have just been renovated and were very tastefully decorated - along the lines of a new Westin, including a spacious armour with built-in lighting, TV, beautiful bathroom, nice desk for spreading out the work, luxury linens and fluffy pillows, and soothing color scheme. The staff, however, was the best part of the hotel. It reminded me of a Eurpoean hotel in terms of their graciousness. There was a large meeting / convention taking place while we were there, but the hotel never felt crowded. I would go back to this hotel any time, assuming I received a discount - I would not pay full rate though.

<Content>Plusses and minuses Like some of the other reviewers, I stayed at the Intercontinental during a business conference. PLUSSES: Clean room, with a very comfortable king-sized bed with great pillows. Nice bathroom with granite counters, enough hot water and towels provided. Excellent concierge service (especially a nice young man named Tate) who can direct you to restaurants, walking/jogging paths, parks, shopping, etc. A complimentary shuttle service to nearby places, though you may need to wait a while for it to arrive. Excellent food and service at a lunchtime meeting catered by the hotel. Large variety of restaurants within walking distance. Nice breakfast buffet that gets you in and out quickly. MINUSES: Not up to the standards of other Intercontinental hotels, somewhat dated decor, especially in common areas, as others have stated. VERY inconsistent service in the dining room and lounge areas. On a Friday night with a 1/3 filled restaurant, it took us 2 hours to complete a mediocre dinner due to nonexistent waitstaff. The excuse given by management was we didn't know we'd be so busy. Free appetizers at happy hour in the lounge do not exist after the first tray is consumed by the conference attendees and other hotel guests, unless you complain to the management. SUMMARY: A comfortable, fairly quiet room. Good concierge services. Don't eat at the restaurant for dinner unless you have lots of time and don't want to walk to a local restaurant. I didn't mind the dated decor, but it isn't what I expected from Intercontinental.

<Content>Quiet, but for a reason If you are looking for a place to sleep, this is a good place to stay. The bed was very comfortable. Also, the location is good, just be aware that Dallas Parkway is the frontage road to Dallas North Tollway, it makes it easier to understand directions to the hotel. The hotel looks like it was a great place to stay 5-10 years ago. However, it appears the hotel needs some repairs. Our shower curtain was not long enough to fit in the tub -- major flood. The peephole was missing from our door, leaving just a hole that anyone could look through. Cotton balls from the vanity set came in handy. The rubber door strip had come loose, so it just dangled in front of our door. We had to poke it back into the frame. Valet parking takes up the entire front of the hotel, so if you choose not to valet park, be ready for a long trek. We asked for a double bed and were given a king. Overall, not the service and quality I normally get at Intercontinental Hotels. You can get some cheap rates here, but there is a reason.

<Content>Very nice evening..... In preparation for a dinner, concert, and a night out on the town with my wife I decided to roll the dice for a 4 star hotel on Priceline. Much to my surprise the Hotel Intercontinental was what came up and for a very modest rate at that. I was looking forward to the stay, I was familiar with the hotel and location and have been wanting to try it. I did call ahead and assure my reservation was for a King non smoking room and the friendly young lady on the phone assured me that would be no problem and that we would be staying in the newly renovated area.Having used Priceline in the past I have noticed several hotels give you second class citizen treatment upon arrival. NOT here... the staff at the front desk was warm and friendly as well as very quick and efficient. We quickly had our room key and were off to our room. As I read in an earlier review the elevators were amazingly fast! We got to our room with little time to spare to get ready and head off to dinner before going to the concert. We quickly were in the room and found it to be nicely appointed. We unpacked quickly changed and were off again. Once again and consistent thru the weekend the elevators were always fast -and we were on the 12 th floor! We returned to the hotel late after the concert and the bed was amazingly comfortable and the room was very quiet. This was a nice hotel to get away to and enjoy a first class setting and friendly service from all staff members we came in contact with. I was impressed as we were leaving and walking down the hall to the elevators that the maids we came in contact with all smiled and said good morning! -Friendly indeed!I do want to add that other reviews spoke of the parking fees and I was leery.... I was prepared to pay the $18 to valet park and be done with it since the reviews mentioned that the other parking was $10. However the very friendly older man at the valet told me the self parking only a few feet away was FREE! -Yes a very nice staff and a relaxing weekend! I would recommend this hotel again and again!

<Content>Nice safe business hotel I stayed here for a business meeting. I have no idea about the location, except that it was about $45 by taxi to the airport. This is a very nice business hotel. My room was large and comfortable, and the bed was as nice as anything else I have slept on in similar hotels. The decor was blandly modern - not my taste - it was pretty ugly. I arrived late in pouring rain and was forced to use room service. To my pleasant surprise, the $10 burger was amazing - 12 oz, cooked really well, with great fries and all the condiments. Probably the best and fairest priced hotel meal I have ever had. Also, there is free internet in the lobby to check your return flight - a nice touch, since most hotels in this range ask $10 for the same privilege. In all, a nice pleasant business hotel, with adequate meeting facilites.

<Content>Great Value My wife and I are local to the area, and decided to stay at this hotel for a romantic evening on the town. I was able to book through Priceline, and received an excellent rate of $69 for a Saturday night.Our room was ready upon out arrival at around 2:30 PM, and we were able to upgrade to one of the newly renovated rooms without any additional charge. I was very pleased with the room. It looked pretty much exactly like the photos on the Intercontinental website. The bed was very comfortable, and had plenty of pillows. All other in-room amenities were pretty much as advertised.I do have a couple of small negatives to note about the room. First, there was no hair dryer which I found to be a little strange. However, one was promptly brought to us upon contacting the front desk. Second, there was not an in room safe which I have become rather accustomed to in this grade of lodging.Other than that we had a very pleasant stay. They have a great gym which includes cardio, machines, free weights, and racket ball courts. The pool and hot tub (outdoor) are available, but we didn't venture out since it was about 30 degrees. Free parking was sufficient on the weekend, but might become crowded during the week. The parking structure is $10 with no in and out. We were not able to try the Brunch, but understand from other guests that it is very nice.I would gladly stay at this hotel again......especially if I could get a repeat of the great rate.

<Content>Not a Bad Choice But Read Carefully This is a nice hotel staffed by very nice people. It is typical of a hotel geared for the conference business. The upgraded rooms are nice and mine was carefully cleaned every day. The bed is fairly comfortable and there is a good, big working desk. There is wired internet in the room (charge) but you must pay separately for wireless in the common areas and this wireless won't work in the room.Parking is a mess. The only parking dedicated to the hotel is the valet parking which is $12.50 per day for guests and very limited.. The lots surrounding the hotel are public parking and fill during the day with workers from neighboring buildings. If you use their parking garage (also public and frequently filled) it costs $5.00 every time you move your car. You must feed $5.00 bills into a machine to get your car out. It is unattended so don't forget change. Very inconvenient.The room-service prices are absurd as in all hotels now. Their restaurant is expensive (hamburger over $10.00 on the lunch menu) but decent for hotel food. Expect a very expensive dinner there. There are so many good restaurants in the area that this is not a problem. You can walk to any number. The rooms can be cold (which I absolutely love) but the individual heater in my room worked like a champ. One wierd comment. This hotel had the best and fastest elevators I have ever seen. Though the hotel seemed to be full I never waited for an elevator for more than a few seconds and I was on the 12th floor. Do not expect a five star experience here. It is a good utilitarian hotel with excellent conference facilities and a very nice staff. I paid $100.00 per day with a conference which is about average. If you are a business traveler you will find better values with more perks in the area. If you are visiting the neighboring office buildings this might be a good choice. If you are looking for a good place for a conference this might be the one. Their conference staff was as good as I have ever seen. Just make sure your folks can find a place to park. I spent 6 days at the hotel and was comfortable. If not for parking and the food prices I would have rated it above average.

<Content>delightful Booked a room here via Priceline and at the desk asked for the rooms in the upgraded section. 11th Floor room was terrific. I will concur that the rooms are chilly but that was my only real issue with my stay. The renovation of my room could not have been more to my liking. Great bed, great lamps, great space, nice art on the walls (not so commercial looking like most hotels). Marble baths with thick granite counter. Neutrogena soaps. Comfy furniture and nice desk. If I hadn't booked Priceline, I think I'd still be pleased with the full price listing of 109 on the website for this period. It's also right on the tollway and near tons of great dining options. Soon, I think they'll update the lobby as it is a bit dated but certainly fine and comfortable. Friendly checkin. Good choice.

<Content>A very nice hotel! Needing a break from the norm we decided to utilize Priceline in acquiring a hotel in the area and price range that we needed. We ended up with Hotel Intercontinental in Dallas (Addison). Prior to departure we read some of the previous reviews regarding this hotel, and quite frankly we were a bit tentative. None-the-less we struck out for our pre-booked destination and decided to make the best of it. We were not disappointed. The location was easy to access and plenty of parking (except the night of the OU/TX game...it was crouded) but we utilized the parking garage for $5, so it was no big deal. The main lobby and ballroom were cavernous. Our room was attractive and clean and provided a pretty view of the area (we were on the 11th floor). One of the hotel guest's that night of the game got a little roudy and loud, but the hotel staff resolved that quickly and without incident. The hotel is centrally located, with easy access to the Galleria Mall (about 1.5 miles away)...and an added bonus was the MANY and varied restaurants within walking distance. No less than 100...truly! As pleasure travelers we did not utilize alot of the business aspects of hotel, but certainly see the prospects of those needs being met. Normally, we have used the Westin Galleria for our stays, but the cost was prohibitive (over $179 a night)...and this hotel we got for under $100 a night. At that price I believe it a good value, and would certainly consider returning in the future!

<Content>Nothing to complain about We booked the hotel via Priceline and for $60 a night, can't complain whatsoever.Room was nice - we were on the 7th floor. Awesome king sized bed with way too many pillows! Was a bit of the 'cool' temp side - but not unbearable.The bathroom is a bit 'dated', just particularly around the tub - some tiles are in need of replacement.The pool is fine - but nothing great - hot tub isn't 'hot' - rather luke warm.Fitness centre is good - a bit warm, but you're there to sweat anyhow!Within a 5 min walk, there are a tonne of restaurants on Belt Line, so don't think you have to only eat at the hotel. Only real complaint is there seems to be a lack of pop/vending machines for any late night snacks...Otherwise, for the price, the quality of the hotel is definitely worth it!

<Content>Nice Experience, but not worth $100 I got my room through priceline for $65. After reading the other reviews, I knew to spend the $15 to upgrade to the remodeled room. It was a pretty nice hotel, but I wouldn't say it was a 4 star. It's more of a three star. Room was nice, but freezing! The controls in the room don't work. Room service was priced OK, but the food wasn't awesome by any means. They charge for local calls, internet usage, fittness center usage. Basically they charge for everything.

<Content>Nice Surprise After being very disappointed in the quality of the standard room during my stay in February (old furniture, old bathroom materials, lumpy pillows, etc.), I decided to try The Intercontinental again this month when I got a $64 rate on Hotwire. This time, I asked for an upgrade to a Premier (?) room and actually got it at the same rate. EVERYTHING in this room was brand-new, from the marble, granite and plumbing fixtures* in the bathroom, to the down comforter, pillows, linens, carpet and furniture in the bedroom (* While almost everything was brand-new in the upgraded room, the original 15-year old toilet had not been replaced. It was discolored and chipped, and while perfectly functional, I wondered why the hotel didn't go the extra mile and spend another $200 to also replace it during the re-model). My only complaint about this room is that the A/C has almost zero adjustability and is FREEZING cold. Something really needs to be done about this... Summary: Based on this experience, I'll more than likely give The Intercontinetal another try within the next month or so because the Hotwire rate is so low...

<Content>Be firm with the front desk staff I stayed at the Intercontinental Dallas for two nights in May for a large business conference. My room was reserved at the conference rate of $130 per night and I reserved about six weeks in advance. When I arrived just before 9pm, the front desk clerk rudely told me that despite the confirmation for a non-smoking room that I was holding in my hand, they only had smoking rooms remaining. I have severe allergies and asthma and stated that this was unacceptable. The employee let out an annoyed sigh and stomped off, returning about ten minutes later to proclaim that she would upgrade me to a non-smoking king bedroom suite for free. This was said as if she was doing me a HUGE favor... providing me with the nonsmoking room I had reserved was apparently going way above and beyond the call of duty.The room I was given was fine. Certainly not 5-star (and seemed even worse since I had stayed at a lovely Sofitel property just the week before), but it was clean. However there were a few concerns: the cleaning staff will not replace half-used or even mostly-used toiletries if you are the beneficiary of a complimentary upgrade and the turndown service will not occur for this same reason. In fact, you are treated as a second class citizen by all the hotel staff. Finally, if attending a conference I suggest dressing in layers as best you can in business attire. Some of the rooms were boiling hot while others were freezing. The food is mediocre at best and the waitstaff do not speak English. If you don't want your salad doused with goopy mystery dressing you must guard it as they will grab it and pour it on without even asking if you want it.

<Content>Variety in the rooms I have stayed at this hotel about 5 times. Like another reviewer said, it feels tired, with lots of wear and tear. Not up to standards of Intercontinental. BUT it reminds me of flying - there is a big difference between the older rooms and the renovated ones, like the big difference between coach and first class. Now, they often want more for the newer rooms, so I don't know if Hotwire is the ticket to one or not. This renovation has been going on for 1-2 years - I don't know why they are taking so long, and think it is causing some ill will. I have seen Marriott renovate an entire hotel in months. The Marriott nearby is nice but also seems a bit tired too. Addison is not much to brag about either but that's another story....

<Content>Not up to the Intercontinental reputation I read most of the reviews at TripAdvisor after booking this hotel through Hotwire for about 65$. Thank goodness for the reviews here!!! The unpleasant experiences shared at TripAdvisor alerted us to the pitfalls of this hotel and we sidestepped some potential disappointments. This review is geared towards average income families looking for a bargain-but-nice vacation experience. HOTEL EXTERIOR: Nice looking, we arrived early for check in (about 2pm), and there was plenty of self parking. HOTEL INTERIOR: Attractive, though somewhat abandoned. Large cavernous spaces with few people using them. The large lounge area was out of date, with mauve and burgandy decor. ABOVE ALL READ THIS PART: Thanks to the reviews here I specified at check in that I *wanted a remodeled room*. The clerk said I was *not* booked for a remodeled room. I gave him a long look and said I strongly prefer a remodeled room (Thank You TripAdvisor!). He said there was a 15$ fee. I said 15$ more just to have a room that you have remodeled?. I just stared at him. He finally relented and said he would waive the fee and give us a remodeled room. I give this hotel points for accomodating a guest with a free upgrade. THE REMODELED ROOM: It was indeed new-ish feeling, with up-to-date decor. The toiletries were 4 star, nice quality. Downdside? This hotel is catering to *the business traveler*. Vacationers may be disappointed. The room is dominated by business features~a giant desk, bathroom phone, etc. I shudder to think what a disappointment anything less (read, an old room) would have been with a 4 star rating. The room was nice, but definitely the least a guest at this hotel should expect. AMENITIES: The mid-roof tennis court was fun to use but very worn down. Faded court and nets missing. Plus side~free tennis supplies upon request. Outdoor only pool (not rooftop). Large work out area with two indoor racketball courts. WATCH THE CHARGES: Internet and local calls are *not* free. OVERALL: Nice for the business traveler, and nice for anyone who can hotwire it for less than 70$. You won't be disappointed if you underpay. Walk ins be warned~I would not pay 150$ for this experience.

<Content>Nice hotel. Nice hotel, nice bathroom amenities, nice staff. They had sold out the room I reserved and got me an upgrade, which was gret because we got one of the renovated rooms. Good location, right off the toll road.

<Content>Quiet, competent, quality Stayed at the Intercontinental for a conference, on the Concierge floor. All as expected in the clean, comfortable room. Pillow-top mattress and plenty of pillows as expected in a hotel of this quality. Room was clean, housekeeping came promptly every day. The housekeeping staff did one thing that is a pet peeve of mine - they changed the radio station from the public radio station I'd selected (which is hard to find on the dial) back to the classical music station they use for turndown service. This is so vexing, but obviously they've been trained to do it. Nice bath amenities. Shower curtain rod curved out - yay!Fresh orchid in the bathroom.Plenty of service staff in all public areas, restaurant, bar - food and beverage very solid. I ordered room service breakfast and asked for a couple of special things (eg: 2 egg omlette instead of 3, skim milk, salsa on the side) which usually most hotels mess up in some way, but it came within 20 minutes exactly as ordered. The cost was extremely reasonable for room service in a hotel of this quality. Also, many, many great restaurants within walking distance plus the Dallas Galleria shopping mall across the street.Business center was outsourced but the costs were not outrageous as they are in some hotels - $2.99 access fee and 60 cents a minute (it's much worse other places).Service was uniformly cheerful and efficient.

<Content>Nice room, but not perfect yet Return visit to the hotel, again booked through Hotwire at $81, so the price is definitely right. Asked for a renovated room when I checked in and was given one. Great decor, good size, very clean and quiet, really comfortable bed. So if you are looking for a nice room, then this definitely is a good choice as long as you get one of the renovated floors. No conference, so no parking problems.However, a couple of not so good points. Decided to eat at the restaurant and was not impressed - they would like to think this is high-class dining, but food was not good and quite expensive. Service, however, was excellent. But there are plenty of restaurants nearby.Again the front desk seems very understaffed. Luckily, there didn't seem to be many people staying at the hotel, otherwise I could see the potential for long lines. When I checked out, there was a trainee there on his own, and he was not able to something pretty simple - add the item I had taken from the mini-bar to my bill - so I have to wait for it to appear in a few weeks. Seemed to have some problem helping the guy in front of me also.But for me, the location, room and price are all very good, so I will probably return there again for my next business trip.

<Content>Not up to Intercontinental Standards My company ran a large meeting for a major client in Dallas at this Intercontinental in November. My associate and I visited the hotel two weeks earlier to ensure that all our needs could be handled. We were satisfied and booked the meeting and rooms.Unfortunately everything about the experience during the meeting was unsatisfactory. The food was mediocre at best, served by very inexperienced banquet personnel. Several times it wasn't even what we ordered. The basic norms of business meetings such as refreshed coffee throughout the day wasn't done properly once in two days.We sent our newly custom made company polo shirts out for a cleaning the day before the meeting and one of the shirts, mine (I am the company CEO) was lost despite the fact that it was in with the entire lot. It was never found. I managed having my other company shirt washed late at night prior to the next meeting day. The Front Office Manager offered to pay for its replacement, which was the least he could do, but it took nearly five weeks after the event to get a check with three follow up calls.The meeting space needs were not handled with the level of professionalism and care that I expected from a supposedly top notch chain such as the Intercontinental. Materials shipped to the hotel a week in advance were no where to be found upon arrival until my associate made a huge stink with the management after confirming with FED EX that they had indeed been delivered as promised...the boxes had arrived on time but were deeped sixed somewhere for a day and unless we had screamed we would not have had access to our meeting materials. NO one in the front office cared about our needs during this stay and we spent a fairly good dime in two days.Some of the rooms have been renovated and are a great improvement over the older rooms. Insist on them. Shortly after our meeting we learned the Director of Sales quit..supposedly because the hotel's standards were so low and beneath him (he was a European hotel guy), but in fairness I think he was a big reason our meeting planning was such a disaster.This same Director of Sales offered us 40,000 Priority Club Pts to make up for the poor experience. Five months later NO POINTS have been credited to my account and there is no one at the hotel to substantiate his offer. Another thought to consider. The lobby area and bar permits smoking and this place seems to attract lots of smokers to the point where being anywhere in the lobby nearly any time of day can make a non smoker like myself instantly sick besides finding your clothing stinking of smoke within five minutes or less. If you have to wait downstairs, wait outside if possible rather than in the lobby.If you are considering a hotel for a meeting in the North Dallas area I suggest you AVOID this hotel for such a purpose. It doesn't deserve its affiliation with the Intercontinental chain which generally in my experience runs and maintains top flight properties. Consider the Marriott Quorum just down the block instead. We did for the follow up meeting and had a very good experience.

<Content>A Solid Choice for Adults We also booked the InterContinental at the Hot Wire rate. To appreciate the InterContinental, you must understand it for what it is. The hotel appears to make most of its money from business travelers (who will pay the high nominal room rate) and from hosting events, like wedding receptions. Thus its biggest warts to the tourist. First, I agree with the previous poster, there are too many other good hotels in this area to pay over $100/night to stay at the InterContinental. Second, we didn't bring our kids, but had we done so, our stay would not have been as pleasant because the only pool is an outdoor pool and we stayed in February. However, the hotel has a great sports club, indoor raquetball courts,and several outdoor tennis courts. The third issue we had with the InterContinental is because it is a premium destination, almost all parking in front of the hotel is valet parking. Parking on the side is free, but there are not enough spots to support the entire hotel. If you can't find a free spot, your choices are then to take a chance leaving your vehicle at an unmonitored lot at a neighboring business, or to park at the hotel's parking garage and pay $5 every time you return. Having to worry about parking was the biggest down side for us. We had a blast at the hotel in the health club. The hotel is conviently located to several excellent restaurants and other businesses. In the right circumstances (right price and knowing there are no major parking-spot eating events), we would stay at the InterContinental again.

<Content>A good option We booked through Hotwire and got a rate of $58 which made the stay seem very reasonable. I would be hard pressed to pay the $129 a night found through their website. The location is central to the galleria and right off the tollway (you can avoid paying the toll by staying on the service road). We were able to park right out front and enter into what is an enormous lobby. The staff was friendly but I did think they were trying to upsale us.Upon check-in we were asked if we wanted to spend $15 to upgrade to a remodeled room. They just need to do all the rooms remodeled and up the price for all rooms.The facility and public spaces are very nice. The room itself that we got was big by normal hotel standards. The furniture and room itself was clean and not run down, but does look a bit tired. The best part of the room was the down top mattress, water pressure, and size of room. The amenities of coffee and toiletries were adequate as well. I would stay here again at the hotwire price but not over $100 a night.

<Content>Nothing short of wonderful! We booked this hotel through Hotwire for $58 a night, so I was a little concerned about the class and quality for something so cheap. So I look at the reviews here and I get a little scared.To my amazement, the hotel was awesome! The staff was friendly, always an elevator waiting to take you to your room (I'm impatient so that's a huge plus for me - I hate waiting!), and wonderful service. The bed was so comfortable with lots of pillows. Another big thing of mine is the water pressure, and we had a really nice shower! It's also in a great location and very close to a liquor store. =)I don't know why anyone would rate this hotel low. It is true to 4 star form and definitely a steal for $58 a night. I've stayed at some dumps and some really nice places, and this is one of the nice ones!

<Content>Not So - O.K. Continental Stayed here for a convention. The Hotel is an overall O.K. Continental. Needing some more upgrading on the rooms. Parking is a major problem during a convention. If you didn't get in your room early enough you had to park in the parking garage and pay $5.00 to get out of it every time. They let R.V.'s take up multiple spaces in their parking lot which they should not, this is very inconsiderate to fellow hotel stayers in relation to the limited free parking available. They should validate the parking for their patrons but they don't. The Monte Carlo restaurant is o.k. but very overpriced for the food and service that you receive. This Hotel is deceiving and not what it appears to be, it's getting a little age on it and is outdated in many ways. Elevators are slow and very inconsistent for as many as they have. I would stay here again but not for a top dollar price that they try to get. The staff was overall very helpful and courteous and helped us get a small refrigerator for our room at no charge. They wanted to charge us for it at first. Not! Their is also a wonderful Toll Road that you have to take to get in and out of Addison to the Hotel Intercontinental. They got you coming and going.

<Content>Big Disappointment Chose the hotel based on location (across the street from work). Looked good and sounded good on net. Parking lot, lobby and bar/restaurant were empty. Know why after spending one night. Checked in and paid extra for new room. Looked nice when walked in. But that was the end. Hard bed. TV movie connection didn't work. Remote stopped working half way thru evening and when hospitality fixed they offered that this was new room and still in shakedown. Good to know I was a guinea pig and paying extra for it. No room service after 11. No in room coffee, tea or mini bar. Only bottled water at $6 each. Temperature controls varied between unbearably frigid and just plain cold. Best option was to shut off entirely and rely on air from hall, which was plenty. No bathroom fan. No in-room safe. Extra charge for internet. And no wireless. Won't be back despite handy location. Too many good hotels in the area. Looks is all this one has got going for it.

<Content>Not a four star hotel! We booked two nights at this four star hotel to find out it is a two star at best! The rooms were in poor shape as far as bedding and furniture, despratley in need of a renovation. The bathroom fixtures were broken, faucets and door stoppers. The pool was filthy and the hot tub was taped off, evidently broken with no time frame as to when it would be fixed. The hotel movie system did not work the entire stay. On the upside the restaurant staff was friendly.

<Content>Great Experience at the InterContinental Dallas During my stay, I found out that a portion of the hotel has been completely renovated and a portion has been partially renovated, the brand new rooms are a vast improvement, and are well worth the extra amount they are charging. Luxurious and definitely InterContinental standard, larger sized rooms than many of the other InterContinental hotels (Mayfair London, Chicago, Mark Hopkins San Fran).The hotel is in a great area of town that is much more upscale than my Downtown Dallas experiences and has much to do within a relatively small area. I would certainly stay here again next time.

<Content>Mediocre At Best - Not Intercontinental Material Wow - what a dissapointment! Usually you can rest assured that most Intercontinental locations will be of the highest order but that is not the case with the Intercontinental Dallas. The positives are the entrance, which is impressive, and the location - close to the Galleria and numerous other places to eat and shop. Other than that I cannot recommend this hotel. Intercontinental should be ashamed to have this location under its umbrella.Firstly, the elevators are older and most had a stale cigarette smoke odor that was quite noticeable. The hallways were clean and appeared ok but they looked as if they had been renovated with little attention to detail. Crown molding on the doors looked cheap. Also, the walls must be paper-thin because as I was entering my room I could hear the peron in the room next door urinating! That's right - urinating! It was extremely loud in the hallway and felt like I was in the person's restroom! The rooms are mediocre at best and the bedding is horrible! Usually, Intercontinentals have superb bedding with down featherbeds, comforters, etc. Not this location! It was just the run-of-the mill hotel bedding with a cheap mattress and cheaper bedding. I have stayed at Holiday Inn Expresses (which are owned by Intercontinental Hotels) that have nicer and more sumptuous rooms and bedding! The bathrooms were also lackluster. Older fixtures and an outdated shower were really disappointing. Even the towels were horrific! I kid you not, the towels at Holiday Inn Expresses are much nicer than at this location! Cheap and thin is the order of the day for this Intercontinental's towels. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this location and WILL NOT stay here again. I may sound like a nitpicking complainer but for the price of $195 (I was a chump and booked my room straight through Intercontinental) plus a $6.00 fee to use the gym you would be better off at a HI Express, Hampton Inn or any other location that is much cheaper! After having stayed at the Intercontinental Atlanta many times (and being spoiled by it and its amenities) and then the Intercontinental Dallas I must say that Intercontinental Hotels should be ASHAMED to have this location bear its usually superior name! Shame on you Intercontinental - you can do better!
