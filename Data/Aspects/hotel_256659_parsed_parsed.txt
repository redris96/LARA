<Content>Best 5* Hotel in Sydney My best friend and I planned a four night luxury stay to recover from Christmas. Check-in was fast and efficient. We requested a room on any floor ending in 03 as we believe that these are the largest size of standard room at the Westin. Generally the room sizes at the Westin are larger than the norm.We have stayed at this property many times since it opened and were pleased when we entered our room to find new carpet on the floor. We also noticed that the white sheets had a caramel edge which to us indicated that the sheets where new.In the past year or so, the Westin has also replaced its old TV's with large Flat screen TV's and upgraded the in house movie system.Breakfast in Mosaic was very good and room service meals while expensive, where hot and well presented.Overall the service was excellent and it is great to see that the Westin is updating its accomodation.While the veiw from this hotel is nothing to write home about (nor the toiletries), this is by far one of the best hotels in Sydney, for its accomodation, large bathroom including large shower head above a walk-in shower and large bath tub, location and very good service.

<Content>Not overly thrilled... We stayed at the Westin Sydney in early Feb 2008 for 4 nights, which admittedly was awhile ago. However after reading some of the current reviews, I thought it time that I say something about this overrated hotel. My wife and I generally enjoy staying at the Westin chains around the world, but the Sydney Westin was a let down.On arrival, we weren't greeted with a smile or any pleasantries by front desk. Although check-in was prompt and efficient, it was all too cold and clinical. Some warmth and a smile would've been nice! Westin prides itself on personal service - I didn't see any sign of that.The room was nice and tidy, which was welcomed. We had the Deluxe room. The room fittings were of relatively high standards, the bathroom was clean and modern, and the general living area was spacious enough for a family of three. The bed was comfortable enough. Room service was prompt in their delivery of the cot for our then 16 month old son.The concierge was always very helpful and courteous. He gave us great tips and advice on how to get around the city, and of some general sights and attractions. Although we knew quite a bit about Sydney (having been there several times before), he still managed to give us a great rundown on Sydney.Our room didn't come with breakfast, so I'm afraid we can't comment on the quality of their food.Our main gripe was at check out time. We discovered that approximately AUD110 worth of local phone calls was mysteriously charged to our room phone. I disputed this with front desk but they were adamant that we made them! Why would I have kicked up a fuss about local calls if I didn't make them!? I found them to be extremely unhelpful, cold and very clinical in handling the issue. There was no sign of any empathy or concern whatsoever. I wasn't even offered a refund. Another hotel we stayed at in Jun 06 (Sheraton Mirage Port Douglas) and had a similar issue with offered us a refund on the spot - no questions asked. I was very dissapointed with the Westin Sydney to say the least.When it comes to hotels, you can have the nicest and modern looking rooms. But being the service industry, if your staff can't empathise or 'connect' with your customers (us), you'll never retain their business, and quite possibly lose them forever.The Westin Sydney has lost us as customers, and it will take a lot of convincing for me to give them a second chance. If you (like us) place emphasis on personalised and empathetic service above all else, the Westin Sydney isn't the place for you.

<Content>New year at Westin Sydney As previously pointed out by other members, I can summarize the Westin Sydney as follows:Plus: LocationPlus: Rooms, decoration, general comfortPlus: Baggage staff and luggage deliveryMinus: Concierge serviceMinus: Price quoted from 31 Dec 2008 till 4 Jan 2009 an average of AUD 600. This hotel is not worth it as the service does not follow expectations. After looking at the prices decided to book with SPG points and was well advised to do so - room size and service level definitely not worth AUD 600 per night.Minus: Service Express is basically useless, cannot answer any question, confirming the rating from other memberMinus: Contrary to other member, my evaluation of the Concierge(s) rank below average - tried 2 of them. The concierge desk is insufficiently staffed, fails to pick up calls, does not know anything about transportation (except take a taxi, mate) and restaurants. I always thought that they golden keys concierges proudly wear are the result of year of experience and training, but Westin Sydney failed to deliver on the concierge promise - particularly annoying when you are trying to save time and effort by using concierge service!Minus: I can confirm staff are not trained, giving the overall impressions that shallow service level is maintained to provide the illusion of 5-star service, but once you scratch the surface, service is poor and useless.

<Content>Nice hotel but staff not very nice We stayed at this hotel for our vacation. Good location, clean hotel, and nice executive club. However, the staff and concierge was awful! The concierge was not nice and we had to do all our own research and we have quite a few Emails that were never responded to. My husband is a platinum member and they treated us like we just walked off the streets. We had to complain to get a nicer room, you would think for someone who spends 60% of their time in Starwood hotels as a paying customer we would have been treated a little better. Again, nice hotel but the staff could use some customer service training. We also asked someone at the hotel who was holding a walkie what time something was open until in the hotel, he just looked at us and said you can go see that person over there and ask yourself! Like could he not have said let me find out or let me raido and ask??? Crazy!

<Content>Luxury and Location The Westin Sydney lives up to what it bills itself as, a luxury business hotel. The rooms are clean and modern and offer all the nice little touches that you would expect from a high-end hotel. The rain shower-head was really great, however a bit out of place in drought-prone Australia. It's located right in downtown Sydney, a short walk from the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, so it's not hard to see the most popular sights in the city. I highly recommend the buffet breakfast in the upstairs restaurant.

<Content>Luxury and Style for Christmas I had the pleasure of spending Christmas at The Westin (it was my Christmas present - lucky me!)We stayed in one of their Executive Suites and found the service and entire experience an absolute dream with a beautiful room. It was clean, well appointed and had the most luxurious bed - it was truly as marketed 'Heavenly'. Large Plasma TV's and BOSE Sound systems in both the sitting room and bedroom were fabulous, as was the quality of the decor. The room had floor to ceiling windows with fabulous views out onto the cityscape. The bedroom and sitting room were great but the bathroom was where I actually found myself spending most of my time....The Executive Suites have deep, deep double ended baths which, once filled with hot bubbly water (this takes a while as the baths are so big!) you can sit in and press a button to lift the blind to the floor to ceiling window which looks out over the city. The best bath views I've ever taken in!The entrance to the building is to one side of the old Post Office building and has a great juxtaposition of old and new architecture which sit extremely well together. The Lobby in the courtyard is where, as a change from the usual Christmas Dinner, we decided to have Champagne High Tea. We were met by a friendly, charming girl who was obviously a natural at providing great customer service. As we sat admiring this architecture we were approached by a gentleman, who we assume was a porter, who proceeded to regail us with some history of the building and the local area giving us an insight into some extra things to do and places to go. The service from start to finish was second to none and I would love to go back (hint hint, nudge nudge!).This hotel most definitely lived up to expectation and I would happily stay again and again.

<Content>Extremely luxurious LOCATION: The Westin is extremely centrally located at No 1 Martin Place, right near the Pitt St mall shopping district. The closest train station would be Martin Place and the second closest would be Wynyard. THE ROOM: We stayed in a standard room with a king size bed (which was extremely comfortable) in the modern wing (rather than the historic wing which is somewhat more expensive) and it was highly impressive. The d茅cor was very modern and the design of the room is quite unique: there is a glass pane separating the bedroom and the bathroom which means that you can see between the two rooms (although there is a shade that you can raise and lower if you so wish and the shower and toilet are in separate rooms protected by frosted glass). It also means that if you were in the bath, you could still watch TV (which happens to be a very large flat screen). Broadband internet is available in-room and wireless in the lobby at a rather high price. The toiletries in the bathroom were generous and smelt great. The room also provides bathrobes and there is an in-room safe and complete mini bar with free tea, hot chocolate and coffee-making facilities. SERVICE: We arrived at 11.30am and our room was already ready which was a nice touch, despite the fact that check-in usually isn鈥檛 until the early afternoon. Every single staff member that we encountered was so very helpful and friendly and the hotel adds nice touches like a free newspaper outside your room in the morning if requested and some iced mineral water in the late afternoon (which we found when we returned from the gym). AMENITIES: Hotel guests can use the gym and pool free of charge at a section of the building which is part of The Westin property but the fitness centre is not owned or operated by the hotel. The gym is, however, quite large with a multitude of treadmills, stair walkers, bikes and rowing machines as well as a range of weighted equipment and free weights. Personal training and services at the spa can also be arranged at a fee. The pool is more like a lap pool and is much smaller in a section above the gym. There are many conference rooms in the hotel for business use but we never used any of these or the business centre. IN-ROOM DINING: We ordered room service which came promptly 鈥?we were given an ETA of 30 minutes but it did arrive slightly before that at 27 minutes.. I highly recommend a wood fired pizza 鈥?it鈥檚 healthy and absolutely delicious! The food was quite pricey but it was in line with what I would expect from a hotel of this calibre. We never ate at Mosaic but the in-room menu boasts several dishes from the restaurant which contain 鈥榮uperfoods鈥?and there is an explanation in the in-room brochure about such foods which promote healthy living, etc. MISC: One of the brochures in the room states that there are special running sessions with a Running Concierge but when I phoned the front desk, they informed me that this property doesn鈥檛 have a Running Concierge. They do, however, have running maps (6kms or 8kms) available from the front desk. The Westin is a strictly smoke-free hotel and there is a $300 cleaning fee charged to your card if evidence of smoking is found in your room. In general, the hotel has a great feel 鈥?they seem very 鈥榳ith it鈥?in terms of sustainability, charitable giving with the UNICEF 鈥榗heck out for children鈥?campaign that they run and healthy in terms of the menu.

<Content>Great Hotel GREAT staff We have just completed a 3 month trip around Australia.We started at the Westin in Sydney and as we enjoyed it so much, we completed our journey at the Westin Sydney.Indeed, we initially booked in for 8 nights back in September but actually stayed for 12 nights then with a further 4 nights in Nov/ Dec at the end of our trip.Unlike the last reviewer, we can find nothing to fault the hotel - even when they were very busy.The two rooms we had (on the 20th and 23rd floor) were very clean and modern with a glass partition between the bathroom and living area (which can be closed by a blind). The view was stunning overlooking the clock tower.We stayed at the Park Hyatt last year which was excellent especially with a room overlooking the Opera House, but I have to say, the staff at the Westin were far friendlier and very efficient.Special mention to Dominique who looked after us very well and upgraded us to a lovely room on our first visit. Also Rohan who ensured we had a similar room on our second visit.Room service was always bang on time as was the Laundry service.Breakfast was a little expensive but I obtained a better deal to include breakfast when I booked direct for our second visit (compared to going via a Tour Operator when we first booked in).Ron and Gary on Concierge also friendly and very helpful. (I think the previous reviewer was staying in a different hotel!).Overall, great location. Fantastic service and lovely clean modern rooms with good food. What else do you need from a City Centre hotel?We would definitely stay again and would highly recommend to others.Our home in Sydney!

<Content>THE worst staff Stayed at Westin Sydney for 3 nights with family (2 rooms, total cost over $2000) - basically we won't be back - here are some pointers - - Zero recognition as Starwood Platinum othet than the points and breakfast- Front Desk Agent had no idea whether the hotel's rooms were connecting (!!) - had to get manager...- Asked for upgrade as Platinum Guest and was told hotel was full. I had to get a Starwood reservation for a Junior Suite to prove to the Service Express hotel operator that an upgrade was indeed available... She argued with me - literally argued with me - to the point I just asked for the Manager... He explained that of course an upgrade was available - just that it was on a low floor... (So why make me go to the extent of making a dummy reservation rather than be honest and up-front with me?!?...)- I advised I'll stay in a regular/non-upgraded room, but requested a higher floor - was advised only 1 of our 2 rooms could move to a higher floor... (Please keep in mind that I have been a Starwood Platinum member since the program was created... Most hotels recognize Platinum members with a fruit bowl or at the very least a note - at the Westin Sydney there is ZERO recognition)- After the first night I had my PA 'negotiate' to get the 2 rooms on a higher floor - I honestly can't tell you why the hotel staff make you jump through hoops to be decent/hospitable - at no cost to the hotel... - Asked for 2 bottled of complimentary water (which we got on the first day) and advised we can only get these at turn-down service... I thanked the operator and asked that these be delivered now instead of later - of course the bottles never came... :)- No Concierge at night... Asked Front Desk Manager how long it would take to get to Sydney Bridge Climb in the morning - his reply was Oh, you could allow half an hour. I told him there was now way that The Rocks (area) was a half hour away from the hotel - he replied that he didn't know where the Bridge Climb was (this is one of Sydney's TOP tourist attractions!!) and of it's at The Rocks, then half an hour was about right - or maybe 15 minutes... Aaaahhhhh... Nothing like an ignorant local to give you misdirections...- Turned-up at Coffee Shop at 10.31pm - literally 10.31pm - and was told we could not be seated for desert as they close at 10.30pm... Spoke to 2 staff members who advised we should go to the lobby (we've already been there and they had nothing) or order room service (!!). After trying to 'negotiate' for a few minutes I asked for the manager, who apologised, but frankly, by then we were over it...Bottom line - hotel is well located, rooms are not large and have no views, but are nice/comfoartable and have decent bathrooms. Staff is a whole other story - long waits at front desk, and VERY MUCH in need of training in customer service - in several departments, from the phone, to front desk and fb. Staff clearly unaware customers pay their wages and leave the impression we are distrubing them...We won't be back...:)

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel for my birthday. We arrived at 12 noon and Paul the very polite customer service employee said we could check in already and offered us the choice of 2 rooms and we ended up chosing the room on the 25th floor room 2502. This was the Starwood Guest floor.Paul even offered to deliver me a complimentary gift to my room for my birthday which ended up being cake, a letter and complimentary bottles of water (water was an amusing touch). The hotel staff were always ready to help in any way possible.The room itself was nice, clean and comfortable. You could see the bathroom through the glass window in the bathroom, or you could press a button to close the blinds on the bathroom window.The bathroom had a separate section for the bathroom and shower. The room itself had a nice view of Martin Place. The room had a flat screen and DVD player so it would've been good to bring own DVDs to watch.The gym was pretty average. It was a task to get to, and a confusing task to find the pool. The pool area is pretty average, nothing special. We ordered in room dining which was so expensive! $21 for a sandwich w fries and what they call a salad which consisted of just lettuce. They stuffed my order but was prompt to fix it. The restaurants in the hotel are very overpriced, you would better eating out.The hotel is located right next to Pitt Street Mall which is the shopping precinct of the city. Overall good hotel.

<Content>Good Business Hotel Hotel is clean, modern and very grand. Rooms are quite small for A$300/night. While the rooms are very modern with glass and beech wood, there were small things that were annoying for a 5 star. For example, the cabinet door to the mini fridge did not close properly and so the sharp stainless steel door handle was always jutting out waiting for you to gash yourself on it. This is exacerbated by the small size of the room which increased the likely hood of hurting yourself. The onsite Westin restaurant and bar was WAY overpriced. Since when did the Westin start competing with Michelin star restaurants in pricing? A$30 for a hotel cheeseburger??? Lets get serious. Oh ya, they tried to charge me an additional A$20 for a late checkout. My total bill was A$1,500 over 3 days and they tried to ding me with A$20 on the way out. Incredible. The hotel gym is actually a private members gym. It was old with old equipment. This would have been acceptable for a standard hotel but not a 5 star that charged $300 / night. Not a big deal but just another thing that adds up agains this hotel. Location was excellent and centrally located in the CBD - if thats what you need.To sum it up, the hotel is clean and slick but scratch past the veneer and its actually a fairly significant rip off. You can probably do better in a boutique hotel and get more bang for the buck.

<Content>brilliant stayed in the Westin for 5 nights in October, what a brilliant hotel!! we were met upon arrival and bags were taken from us. we were whisked to reception to check in. as it was 7am the room would not be available to a few hours. the receptionist took my mobile phone number and said she would call when the room was available and sure enough at 10am i got the phonecall.when i arrived in the room the bags were already there. the room was gorgeous! very big with a huge bed which was so comfy that everytime i sat on it i nearly fell asleep!! the bathroom was just as good with a huge shower and a rainforest showerhead too! (i struggled to get the rainforest showerhead to work but reception staff were very helpful) the bath was big enough for tow people and had a huge glass window looking out into the room. great if you were with a partner and were happy to be seen in the bath but if not there was an electronic blind that came down. the room was cleaned every day and the shampoos etc replaced every day. there was even free bottled water and ice every evening!staff were very helpful and polite. i did not eat in the hotel but the prices were quite high. a little tip, if you go down the stairs in reception there are a vast array of restaurants and bars that serve lunch. (i did not spot them until the final day and it looked very busy but i cannot comment on prices or quality of food). great location 10 min walk from harbour, 5 minutes to the right of the hotel was a huge food court with great choices of food at great prices!! also brilliant shops within 10 mins walking distance! i would def recommend this hotel to people and would def go back! worth the money i paid to stay there!

<Content>Very welcoming and enjoyable stay I decided to treat my wife to a mini break by staying at the Westin Hotel in Sydney, Australia.We have previously eaten to this Hotel on many occassions and have been well treated by the team and have really enjoyed the experience.When we arrived at the Hotel for our stay, the receptionist was engaged with a customer, but within a split second, we were approached by another staff member (badge said supervisor) and were booked in quickly and efficiently wit a full explanation of all services at our disposal. He even booked a table at their Mosaic restaurant for us.The room was very well appointed and in modern taste, which we were very comfortable with.The service and quality of the food was exceptional. The wine list a little underdone, but adequate.In the morning, the breakfast was fantastic. The checkout process was fast and efficient.We will definitely go back.

<Content>Wonderful bed, great location I couldn't find anything to dislike about the Westin Sydney, but then again, I'm usually not a 5-star hotel traveller, so maybe it was easy to be impressed! The check-in process was prompt, and the staff were reasonably friendly. The view from the room wasn't great, and we didn't get a room with a bathtub separated from the bedroom by a sheet of glass (what you will see in some of the travellers' pictures here). But we didn't have any major complaints, because the bed was very comfortable and the room was always clean and well made-up when we got back every evening. It was also very spacious, with the toilet and shower partitioned off from each other. The concierge in the lobby was friendly and knowledgeable and readily gave us directions to the factory outlets when we asked. Even though we weren't business travellers and certainly weren't dressed as such, I didn't notice any difference in treatment as some reviewers have noted here.

<Content>Lousy showers This is the second time I have stayed here and I didn鈥檛 like it 2 years ago and I still don鈥檛 Oh yes, you鈥檒l be impressed by the d茅cor and the general finish of the place. But just wait till you have a shower. Now you know how annoying it is when you have a shower and someone in the house washes their hands or flushes the toilet. Well, imagine that in a hotel. The fluctuations were so severe I tried to shower very late at night but even then I kept getting frozen or burnt. Unbelievable, in 2 years they never bothered to fix it. Also, I don鈥檛 know why but the Heavenly bed just didn鈥檛 feel so heavenly.

<Content>Nice design I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in the end of August 2008. The room was a executive floor room on the 29th floor, with a nice view of the Sydney skyline. Included in the rate was breakfast at the Westin Club. The location is certainly central. Placed in the middle of Pitt street, it's a 5 minute walk to the harbour. It IS a central business district style location, and not touristy, but i preferred it that way.The hotel is part of the huge Martin Place 1 highrise, which also features the main post office (historic building), super markets, shops and offices. The lobby and reception area is nice. and modern and well lit. There is a lot of people in the lobby area at all times.Checkin was quick and easy. No problems. There seems to be lines at the usual check-in and check-out times, but I arrived very early, so that wasn't a problem for me. As part of the room charge, they allowed early check-in (7 in the morning), so that was great.The room was nice. The design is obviously contemporary which I personally prefer. The build quality and look/feel of the recent renovation, wasn't really that great. In the details, there are certainly room for improvement. Bathroom fixtures mounted a bit crooked, mended paint jobs, a spot of mold in the shower, etc. I mean, honestly, they are small points. TV worked good, reception was good, some pixelation once in a while on the cable/satellite feed. Lighting system was among the best I have seen, very easy to use, and well marked. The bed was sort of a mixed experience. I noticed the gentleman on this site, who mentioned he couldn't get a nights sleep in the bed - I sort of agree. The bed is very very soft. If you are used to a firm bed, it will be complicated getting used to. Also, it seems that one matress was firmer than the other, im not sure if this is by design, or because one has seen more use. The curtain between the bathroom and room was a cute novelty detail.Internet connection was wired only. They provide a (short) cable in the room. Phone system was easy, as everything goes to a call center sort of function, and that was brilliant - instead of the usual 8 numbers you have to call.Cleaning was sort of ok. The first day I arrived the floor was dirty because someone had installed/repaired something in the vicinity of the TV system. so there was little white bubbles from the electronics wrapping + some screws and a loose jumper on the floor. Sunday cleaning never happened, as the staff left early, but monday cleaning was much better. No fresh flowers. Anemities are simple and not really luxurious in any way.Room service food was poor. I tried 3-4 different dishes and they were pretty sad. Even the classic room service burger had low quality meat, dry, boring and tasteless. The complimentary water appeared on two out of five days. The minibar was replenish 3 times. Room service and minibar prices were OK compared to the location and country. I guess the real question here is - is this a 4 star hotel or a 5 star? I'd say its a upper end 4 star. And at that it's good. It's no where near international 5 star level. Prices are fair - so take it for what it is. :)

<Content>Modern, deluxe, very central in Sydney We stayed in the Westin for 5 nights mid-August. We had one room with two double beds, so we could sleep with 2 young kids in one room. Location is good, very central. 5 minutes walk from Circular Quay, Darling Harbour and Hyde Park, one minute walk from Pitt St Mall and David Jones. In the heart of the CBD. Room is spacious, modern and spotless. Bathroom is beautiful, nice design, great rain shower and separate bathtub. Breakfast is good but overpriced, especially if you have very good alternatives in the lobby and around the corner. Staff was always very kind and professional. Concierge is very helpful (he helped us to get a table in Restaurant Tetsuya鈥檚, although they were fully booked for months!). Lobby is big and always crowded. Great pizza and sushi in the lower level food court. Swimming pool is situated in the former GPO, quite a walk form the main building. Although not rather cheap, we can highly recommend this Westin.

<Content>Could be better We had high expectation of the Westin Sydney, having had a very enjoyable stay in the Westin Melbourne a couple of months ago. Our experience wasn't up to standard.Firstly, the initial room we were allocated (Rm 303) was very noisy, as it overlooked the restaurants and central atrium. We were so close you could tell what the guest sitting below ordered for dinner. As we had work committments the following day, we went to reception to request a room change. The reception staff member didn't handle the request well - he informed us that the hotel would be quiet after 10.00pm (?), that no other rooms were available and that there was no way he could be expected to remember us checking in as he was a busy man (we'd checked in with him less than 10 minutes previously). Anyway, after a 15 minute wait and consultation with the manager, we were eventually moved to the 18th floor.A much better room, lot quieter but it hadn't been cleaned properly. There was a sticky mess, perhaps juice, on one of the bedside tables and the other had a foul smelling liquid under the radio. We used a flannel from the bathroom to clean this up. In fairness the rest of the room and the bathroom were very clean, so I'm not sure how this grottiness was overlooked. I'd also say that the room decor isn't up to 5 star standard. The carpet looks like it escaped from a basic hotel chain, ditto the upolstery fabric. A long way from luxe.Breakfast was very good. Friendly staff, excellent choice of food and consistently good quality. Worth getting there early to avoid the queque on a Sunday.All in all, if I were in Sydney and looking for a business hotel this is fine but if I wanted somewhere special to stay I'd look further.

<Content>Nice hotel in the perfect location The Westin Sydney is a very nice hotel in downtown Sydney, staff is helpful and courteous - I disagree with the previous reviews. The hotel is nicely located, among pedestrian streets, shopping malls, and within walking distance of many touristic sites. I recommend it more for business than leisure.we were driving around NSW and had to park the car under the hotel: this parking is expensive and procedure for hotel guests to park and pay is not easy.Other than that, the stay, the clean room, the food, the staff, all was perfect. we will definitely go back again.

<Content>The worst night ever Normally I like Westin due to their heavenly beds. I don't know why but at the Westin Sydney the mattress has been sooo soft that I couldn't sleep at all. I called the reception and the told me that they can help me - the next day (which didn't help since I stayed only one night)! So finally I moved to the floor and tried to sleep there. It has been one of the most horrible nights I every had.

<Content>SPG floor was excellent As a Sydneysider I rarely stay in a Sydney hotel, but I have to say the Westin was outstanding. The room is well decorated and generous in size and the hotel staff are informed and helpful. We stayed on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor - I have no idea if it is any different to the others, but it was terrific.If I was a visitor to Sydney and didn't mind not having a harbour view, this hotel would suit me perfectly.

<Content>Schzophrenic hotel staff I heartily agree with Classylad's review of the Westin Sydney - it must have been something about last week because we seem to have had pretty much the same experience.On arrival last Tuesday (3June) for my 10th stay this year(at the Westin Sydney) the reception I got at check-in can only be described as a fiasco and certainly well short of what I expect from the Westin Sydney.It's odd because on my last stay here in April, my colleague and I were bowled over by the helpful, friendly staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The first room I was given was certainly not an upgrade - one of the benefits expected as a Gold SPG member within 2 stays of Platinum membership and on my 10th visit!!!! When I opened the curtains in the first room I was allocated, it faced on to the bridge across to the heritage building. Anyone walking across the bridge would look straight into my room....certainly not what I expect of a 5 star hotel nor as a very frequent, repeat guest.When working in the business centre, my colleague and I tried to order 2 cups of coffee. We called room service and were told that we could not do that. Neither of us could understand why it is possible to order a cappuccino in your room and charge it to your room but NOT possible to order a coffee to the business centre and charge it to your room??!!I honestly feel that some of the staff need to be reminded of some basic facts of the service industry.1. Guests (never mind FREQUENT REPEAT guests) are the only reason the staff at the Westin have jobs.2. the really frequent, repeat guests are the ones they should go the extra mile for.3. NOTE to reception desk staff : If you're going to lie to the customer, make damned sure it's a whopper ... not some half wit excuse you came up with on the spur of the moment. We are not dumb and it annoys us to think we are PAYING you for a service that you are NOT delivering.Failing that, we (the paying guests), have a choice and I for one, will exercise that choice.

<Content>Westin is just okay Westin is in a good location, almost center of city. There are 2 train stops located within walking distance. The rooms are very contemporary, the bathroom design was especially pleasing. I paid extra to be in the higher floors for better views and was given access to the executive lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea, and o'deurves. The breakfast is okay, and the o'deurves is nothing to write home about. The complimentary wireless in the lounge was very handy. The Westin is walking distance to most points of interest, the opera house, darling harbour, etc. Room service takes very long, over an hour, to get to your room. The gym and pool are nice, but a long walk from the tower my room was in; they are located in the older part of the building. The main area that needs improvement at this Westin is the customer service. The personnell in the executive lounge was very slow in serving cordials and teas. The food is served buffet style, but if you are thirsty, it's a good wait. Front desk was not as friendly as some other Westins I have stayed at. Paying extra for the high rooms, was not worth it in the end, as my view was blocked by taller buildings or construction. I was only able to get a glimpse of the harbour in between obstructions. Post office located onsite, this came pretty handy also.

<Content>Excellent corporate hotel with modern rooms My wife and I stayed here for the Sydney portion of our honeymoon. We are Starwood Preferred Guest members and thus were able to pay for part of our stay in points. Our main concern was having a quality hotel with a central, convenient location. This hotel is adjacent to Macquarie Bank and as such does a lot of corporate business; it is obviously more of a business-style hotel. That was fine with us - we had other portions of our trip for the more romantic/quaint type of thing. The rooms are ultamodern with electronic light and fixture controls, glassed-in bathrooms with extra large tubs and a separate shower, and a flat screen TV with sound that is pumped throughout the room. Everything in the room looked brand new and worked well. We did not order room service or use the restaurant other than for the breakfast buffet, which offered a wide variety of options including powerfood-type juice blends. The health club, as other posters have noted, is a bit far away from the modern, new tower (about a 5min walk across a catwalk on the third floor) but is excellently appointed. As it is a private gym and not merely the hotel's health club facility, it has all the features of a modern European-style health club, including a lap pool.  We found the staff of the hotel to be extremely helpful and efficient, as one would expect of a Westin.The skylit, multi-story lobby is also very impressive.

<Content>Worst service ever My wife and i recently stayed at the Westin Sydney and found the service to be far from what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.We waited 40 mins for our bag to be brought to our room and that was only after calling reception.We requested a newspaper which never came.We had to wait 20 mins to be seated for breakfast,had to request cutlery,request a cup of tea and then to make matters worse we were charged $80 for the experience.We were then charged for mini bar items we did not use-this has since been refunded.The list goes on but we will never stay there again.

<Content>Good Location Stayed here for 2 nites on 14th April 2008. The rooms are clean and spacious. Stayed at Level 25 but not much view, many tall buildings around. Only able to see other buildings. Good location, only 8 minutes walk to Circular Quay which is near to the Opear house. The hotel is also near to 2 train stations ie Martin Place and Wynnard. Many high end shops nearby. Be reminded that the hotel is 100% smoke free so you would see people smoking at the entrance of the hotel.

<Content>Loved the Westin This is a fantastic hotel. We spent one night here and when they found out it was our anniversary sent a bottle of champagne to our room. The service was excellent, the room was beautiful, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom large and modern and well laid out. This hotel does not have a great view, and is downtown, but we loved it. We did use the gym and did not think the walk was bad-- you get to see the old part of the hotel, and if you are working out it's not clear why a long walk is a problem.

<Content>Mixed Feelings at the Westin My husband and I spent 10 days at the Westin Sydney as part of our extended holiday January and Febuary. When we booked we were aware we would be in the CBD as opposed to the more central tourist area of the Harbour or Rocks, this was fine as we were only a 10 minute walk away.When we arrived we were promptly checked in but unfortunately to a room that smelt heavily of smoke.We found this very strange as we had been informed prior to our arrival that smoking was banned (this was a strong factor in choosing this hotel) and also that there were heavy penalties for doing so.We immediatley complained and were transfered to another room.The staff throughout our stay were pleasant enough but I would agree with a previous reviewer that they treated 'suits' differently, my husband and I are 'suits' but not on holiday and we found the attitude amusing.We had excellent service from the service express dept and the housekeeping was to a good standard.We ate in the restaurant on one occasion and this was to a good standard but even by Sydney standards expensive.we found the location excellent a great atmosphere in the bars etc in the week and more peaceful at weekends.The main dissapointment for us was the poor weather but that is not the hotels fault.

<Content>One of our favourites We stayed 2 nights at the Westin and it has to be one of the better hotels we've stayed at in Sydney.....and we've stayed at a lot of them!Rooms are nice and modern and clean. However the electric blinds that separate the bathroom from the rest of the room broke down on the last night.The hotel is very convenient if you love shopping. Pitt st mall is just a few metres away. You can walk to the harbour and the parks.

<Content>Great CBD Location Great business location. Neighborhood is slow on weekends, busy during the week. Not sure about the negative reviews, but service was great for us. Checked us in early and room was great. Value proposition isn't the best, but still one of the best hotels in Sydney. Walkable to the Quay and neighborhood pubs that have busy happy hours.

<Content>Superb room - Arrogant hotel Personally I prefer the Radisson Plaza!I cannot fault the room. the very comfortable bed and the great facilities at the Westin. However, all were soured by the rudeness of the person checking me in. First they had messed up my booking but didn't apologies, secondly they told me twice about how I would be fined if I smoked - I felt that they were making assumptions based on the slightly hippy casual clothes I was wearing when I checked in that i was a smoker. I am not. Thirdly, I was disappointed when I came down later in a business suit (I was there for work) that their attitude was completely different. this alone put me off this hotel.The final downside was the extortionate price of room service compared to similar hotels in Sydney. I was left with the overall impression that this hotel thinks it is better than it is. If it's possible for a hotel to be arrogant then the Westin has it.

<Content>Nice except for Pool area! Needed some R  R so headed up to Sydney for 3 nights over Australia Day Weekend to catch up with some friends and enjoy a leisurely few days away. Booked a room at the Westin and checked in late on the Fri night. The guy who served me (I think he was irish) was very friendly and issued me a room on the 19th floor in the tower. The porters were also very on the ball and immediately offered to take my bags up.Got up to the room and it was beautiful! Very nice room with a view of 2 office towers and if you craned your neck you could just see a podium from the Sydney harbour bridge.Room had a plasma tv (Mine wasn't working when i arrived but when i let them know early the next morning it was fixed immediately) with about 30 channels and about 5 radio stations. bathroom had a huge shower with massage showerhead and your standard westin tolietries. It also had a seperate bath but the only thing i found weird was it had a glass wall so you could see the hotel room as you went to the toliet. They did have an electronic blind you could pull down at the touch of a button but it was a bit of a strange experience.One day i went to the pool area which as someone had mentioned is a LONG walk through many corridors and a lift! When i finally got there whilst i appreciate the heritage building is an older building the pool was missing tiles and to be quite frank looked shabby. It looked in bad need of an overhaul. There was no spa attached and the deep end was just over a metre in depth and it was quite small.I didn't actually get to use the actual gym so i can't comment on that but the staff seemed friendly enough when i went to use the pool.All in all a good choice with just some minor issues. A great location and i would definitely be happy to stay there again.

<Content>Westin Sydney falls short and hits average My husband and I stayed at The Westin Sydney for 5 days during Christmas week 2007. Our experience teetered between average and above average during our entire stay. Unfortunately, the high cost of the (higher than usual, due to holiday season) nightly rate was not properly supplemented by the usual Westin experience. We have stayed at many Westins over the years, and this one fell short of expectations. After all, if you are paying for some pampering, you should at least get a little.The positives: Our room was located on the SPG Executive floor, just a couple doors down from the Westin Executive Club. Breakfast is served daily in the Club. Pleasant, though the selections were average and do not change. Free wifi is also available in the Club. The room and bath were spotless and spacious, very contemporary, with a few notable touches. The giant heavenly bed is a favorite of ours.Two train stations are nearby, 5 minutes or less by foot, with a line to the airport.Good location: walking distance to Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, and plenty of CBD shopping.The negatives:Service in the Club was surprisingly below par. And all they had to do was bring our drinks. Only two people provided adequate service. The others, too busy chatting with each other.Views to the harbour are obstructed by tall buildings. We didn't chose the Westin for the view; but if one was interested in unobstructed harbour view, ask for the very top floors or choose another hotel.The concierge staff didn't know much about the area. We spoke to 3 different concierges about restaurants and sites nearby and they gave us wrong information, wrong directions, wrong times, etc... This was highly disappointing because we were not up for wild goose chases in a strange city. They were also not personable and acted as if they were being disturbed, even though each was just standing at their desk on the 3 occasions we came by to ask questions. God forbid we ask them to book us reservations and do their job.If your room is in the newer tower, it is a LONG trek to the pool and gym which is located in the older, historical tower.The restaurant onsite is expensive and forgettable. I can't even remember it's name. The food was served in very small portions and barely average in taste. Better to walk to Darling Harbour.Front desk service was average, not quite welcoming but not quite cold. There was one friendly and helpful fellow though. We're hoping that this experience is an isolated incident. If we had to fly to Sydney again, we would probably give this place a second chance. Hopefully, their service will have improved by then.

<Content>Impeccable Service My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful property on January 4 - January 8. The service on all levels was beyond our expectations from the fantastic restaurant recommendations by the friendly concierge staff to the smiling housekeeping ladies who did the room. Can't praise this hotel enough - well done!

<Content>Good - but a bit less than expected We stayed in the Westin, Sydney at the end of a month's holiday in Australia. We were quite impressed with the room, it was very spacious with lots of nice touches. The bathroom was quirky (with a window into the bedroom) if a little pointless. I felt the hotel location was ok but very quiet at the weekend as in the business district. We weren't at all impressed with the pool which we had to walk miles to get to. Not really worth it. Also, I didn't find the hotel reception staff very friendly or helpful. We had been to Sydney at the beginning of our trip also and stayed at the Old Sydney Holiday Inn and felt that we actually enjoyed our stay there far better although it was no where near as fancy or expensive. We preferred it also in terms of location as it is in the Rock's district which is far nicer than the CBD for tourists

<Content>Worst service in the city Beautiful rooms, nice location, but terrible concierge service! Not just unhelpful but flat out rude--bring a laptop, because if you need any recommendations, you will have to find them yourself online. Also, rooms are awkward to stay in for more than a day since they don't have a dresser or drawers of any kind.I have stayed at the Westin Sydney at least twice a year since it opened, and the service has gone downhill significantly over the last few years. This time, I arrived with extended family who has never been to Sydney before, and asked for a assistance with a dinner booking and movie times at a nearby. Concierge made a face (!) handed me a newspaper, and told me to find the local cinemas in there. Asked if he could he look it up for us and print out the times, like the concierge usually does? No. The next day I saw another concierge was there, and thought I would try again. I asked Gary if there were any restaurants in Chinatown he could recommend. He said sure, listed a few, said there is nothing nice in Chinatown in Sydney, and we should just show up and choose one in the area. I asked if he could make us a booking. No. Are any of the ones he listed better than the others? Quiter? Better service? He stated they were all the same to him. When I got back to the hotel a few hours later I went back up tot the room, paid $30 for an internet connection, looked up the restaurants, called, and found they were completely booked, except for one available time at 5.30. I then tried calling the concierge again, got another person and asked if he could recommend something else. He was unable (or unwilling) to do so. For a hotel of this standard, I would expect a concierge to be able to make these bookings and provide recommendations as required. I have tipped very well every time a concierge has made a booking for me here over the last 8 years, and was very suprised by the serious dowturn in the service. I will not be staying here again. If you are looking for decent service in Sydney, try the Park Hyatt instead.

<Content>A true "aussie" hotel under an American brand I recently spent six nights at the Westin Hotel in Sydney. After reading through mixed reviews on this website, I went ahead with my booking because , well, there does not seem to be any better choices in Sydney. Each luxury hotel in the city has its own issues, be it a small-sized standard room, or poor management, or both. Oh, did I forget to mention the famous heavenly bed at the Westin? The heavenly bed was indeed from the other world. The choices of pillows were fantastic as well. We booked an superior room on the executive floor, which is a bit on the smaller side (probably smaller than my ideal size of 45 sqm). View was standard city view into other office towers. Our Bathroom has a rainshower stall and a deep soaking tub.The executive lounge is located on the 28th floor of the hotel. The size of the lounge is again small and it can get crowded during breakfast time. The lounge serves a small buffet breakfast with a few hot items and evening drinks and hors d'oeuvres. Unlike a few other club-level lounges we patroned, it is up to the individual waiter/waitress whether they would give you a bottle of water outside the lounge for your sight-seeing during the day. As one waiter put it we only allow you to consume our food and beverages within the lounge. On a number of occasions, we saw people sneaking food and drinks out under the cover of their newspaper.Services were spotty and in accordance with the relaxed attitude of Australian culture, as advised by one popular travel book. The front desk staff denied my membership entitlement to upgrade to a preferred room and stated the room I reserved for was a preferred room already. Housekeeping was forgetful about replacing toothbrushes and other vanity items. One conciege staff did not know how to go to the Fish Market via public transport. The list can go on, but you get the point.Overall, Westin Sydney has the hardware and brand name of a five star hotel and service of a 3 star. Next time, maybe I will try the Marriott in Circular Quay or get a service apartment instead.

<Content>Style and Substance in Sydney Ahhh the Westin. Possibly Australia's most comfortable and stylish hotel. Pure quality and luxury. The rooms are very similar to The Westin in Melbourne. Huge heavenly beds with a plethora of pillows to choose from, plasma TV, good work space and a bathroom to die for. Huge shower head, deep bath and luxury fittings. The hotel bar has table service and attracts the deal makers of Sydney.Located in the heart of the city close to everything. The best part is you have FREE access to a fully equipped professional gym for a good work out.The breakfast restaurant was excellent, with high quality food and plenty of choice.Yes its slightly more expensive than other locations in Sydney but it is worth every cent

<Content>5*+. Fabulous. Having read good reviews I stayed here just the1 night using points and was not disappointed. I was allocated a junior suite which was not particularly spacious but was absolutely perfect in every sense, very modern, lots of glass, dream bathroom, walk in shower room, big bath plus the standard issue Westin beds and linen. Everything in the hotel and my room looked new. Why can't my house look like this! The reception and bar staff were efficient and friendly, the ambience of the hotel felt pleasant due to the large open spaces of the lobby and old inner quadrangle that now serves as the restaurant. Some of the features in this grand old building have been preserved, one of which is the steel circular stairway to the business centre which I was able to use free of charge including internet station and printer. Despite being billed as a business district location it is still a good tourist location being maybe a 10 minute walk to Circular key and 5 minutes to Wynyard train station which is a direct line to the airport. I know a few folk gripe about the cost of meals, drinks and laundry which of course were exepnsive but you know that when you visit a Westin.

<Content>Nice place if you're not paying This is an excellent hotel, with large rooms decorated in a tasteful modern style, great service, and a very convenient location for both leisure and business travellers.I do have several reservations about it, though. Some of these reservations are about relatively minor things. One is that the bathrooms are very obviously not soundproofed from the rest of the room, which is a real nuisance, even if you're very good friends with your roommate. Another is that I just don't feel as contented here as I do at the Melbourne Westin. I can't really explain why. My main reservation is that this place is really expensive, even by the standards of other, similar, Sydney hotels. I note that many of the other reviews about this hotel say much the same thing. I'm glad I wasn't the one who was paying for this particular stay in Sydney, and I doubt I'll ever be using this hotel on any of my Sydney visits as a paying guest.

<Content>excellent hotel but watch the extras Stayed here on a business trip in August. Got a corporate rate of AU$290 which was great - I have previously stayed at the Amora Jamison and the Westin is really in a different class. I won't be visiting the Amora again. The room was very spacious, a 37 flat TV with a reasonable range of channels, wonderful bathroom with monsoon shower and of course the heavenly bed. The staff are very polite and helpful - they don't hang around expecting tips.On the downside (if I had been spending my own money) is the price of the extras - AU$20 a day to use the gym, a fairly basic breakfast can get up into the AU$50 region if taken in your room and AU$100 for a week of internet access. I use my mobile phone but a 5 min call is AU$40 to the UK or US they helpfully inform us.

<Content>Fantastic! This is a first class hotel with excellent service, great location and wonderful views. We stayed here as part of our honeymoon and had a wonderful time, in fact we came in and out of here 2 or 3 times. They looked after our luggage when we travelled up north, changed our room when the air-con went on the blink without a hitch. This is how a hotel should be run - I can't recommend this place highly enough.

<Content>Excellent for business or leisure I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Westin Sydney on a business trip, however, the location is also excellent for leisure travelers due to its proximity to attractions such as the Opera House. The rooms were of good size, offered the wonderful Heavenly Beds, but the real clincher for me was the beautiful bathroom and huge tub. The staff was also very effective and one member of their staff was extraordinarily helpful when their printers in their business center wouldn't work. She allowed me to e-mail my documents to her, printed them, made copies, and brought them to my room immediately and turned around what could have been a very frustrating situation. I would absolutely recommend this property and stay again in the future.

<Content>What A New Year Having stayed at many westin and starwood hotels, this has proved to be one of the better! I was expecting new year service to not be as good as normal, but staff here were always very friendly and helpful! Prices were a bit steep, paying nearly 拢300 a night over new year! But to be expected in a major city at this time! Rooms were huge, and a great bathroom with a glass screen enabling you to soak away your stresses whilst overlooking sydney! Perfect! Having been the 5th hotel I have stayed at in the Sydney area, this in now my choice for all return visits, well done starwood, keep those smiling staff!!

<Content>Great hotel but pricey I've recently reviewed the Shangri La and Four Seasons and given this is usually one of the 3 hotels I stay in whilst in Sydney I'd thought I would give my views on this hotel.One of Sydney's newer hotels and in a very central location, the Westin mixes modern chic with old age charm, but it does come at a cost. Whereby other hotels do charge for general additional services, the Westin charges to excess.Room service, restaurants food is average and don't warrant the prices they charge. A charge for the use of the privately run gym is also somewhat exhorbitant (and the gym's not that great either)and the charge for using the internet is also above those of other 5 star hotels. What the Westin does offer however are modern, clean and very comfortable rooms. Decor blends in well and calming. The bathrooms are large and modern and try and book one of the tower rooms where you can sit in the bath and look out into the city skylne. Beds are the classic Westin 'heavenly', very comfortable.Service requests are attended to promptly but lacks the warmth factor. Overall the Westin is a lovely hotel but for me apart from the modern rooms, I prefer the Shangri La or Four Seasons. But if its a central location you're after then go the Westin.

<Content>Incredibly great experience This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at. Period. I was visiting Sydney for a week, and I was thoroughly impressed with this hotel.The facility, the rooms, the service, the atmosphere - everything was excellent without a doubt.The service at the Westin Sydney was extremely professional and attentive. The location is excellent for exploring the downtown area - walking distance from a lot of great restaurants and also the harbor.I highly recommend it.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel The hotel was very elegant. Centrally located in the City Center, it was easy to get around while vacationing in Sydney. It's also a great hotel for business travelers, because of being in the center of the city.The rooms were not that large, but had all the wonderful amenities of the Westin that I am used to. I loved the location being a 10 minute walk to Circular Quay, Darling Harbor, Botanical Gardens, Sydney Tower, etc. I had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this hotel!!

<Content>Best Hotel in Sydney!!!!!!! We stayed at this hotel and it left such a good image of the westin Brand that I have booked the Westin at Times Square.When we checked in at the hotel at 6 in the morning expecting to be told that we could not check in till 12 o'clock. We were told that are room was ready for us to check in.Because we came to Sydney in August the hotel was full and we were told that the only rooms they had left were smoking rooms, which we weren鈥檛 to keen on, but we took it as we were too tired to wait until people checked out that day. As we were in the lift thinking in are heads what the room would smell like. When we go to the smoking floor and the lift doors open we had the first surprise the hall didn't smell like smoke!! What a bonus!! Once we found are room and opened the door we couldn't believe that the room we were given could have been a smoking room!! The room was clean no ashtrays anywhere and the room didn't smell like a smoking room!! That was fantastic and the third surprise we got was when we opened the curtains! We had the best view of the hotel!! When were looking directly onto the clock face, which was fantastic at night as, it lit up at night. The room we had was massive 2-queen size double bed and a massive TV. The bathroom must been the best bit of the room as the bath has a large glass window so people could look in on you when your in the bath. Wrong!! There is a switch that you can press and a large screen comes down from the ceiling and covers the window so you can have a bath in peace. The hotel offers umbrellas in the room so you can take them out when it rains like it did the first day we were there.Shops and Restaurants are in easy walking distant from the hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody coming to Sydney, as this is the best hotel that Sydney has to offer.

<Content>West-out! My wife and I stayed at the Westin for a day and a half for a weekend convention. The side rooms (on floor 12 at least) face a narrow gap between office buildings, without much privacy. The rooms are quiet and modern, and the bathrooms are beautifully decorated. However ... the turn-down service turned-up after 9pm, our breakfast had a dirty coffee cup included, our newspaper was missing one section, and they didn't put in our Starwood number from the booking form. Each were minor issues - although I don't think I've ever turned over a newly arrived room service coffee cup to find it needed a wash before - but they added up to a less than OK experience.

<Content>Still Great, Service Great even with cranky toddler! Our second stay recently and still great. We had three rooms of family and found them most accomodating of us all. We got joined and recently refreshed rooms, with new TVS etc and DVD which our toddler enjoyed immensely. We notified them at v short notice of our need for a cot and arrived to find it made up with a small packet of essential baby items (nice gesture and unexpected). My current favourite Sydney hotel. If you're in Sydney for a little retail therapy as well, the location can not get better!

<Content>First Class Service Excellent service was simply the perfect accompaniment to such a lovely hotel in a grand location. Surroundings were always clean, staff were always friendly and eager to go out of their way to help. One would be mad to go past the Westin as their choice of accommodation. My only complaint would be the shifty in house driver who took me to the airport, overcharging me for the ride thinking I wouldn't notice. But I still wouldn't let that stop me from staying there again...I'd just take a cab next time ;)

<Content>Uncomfortable We have spent 4 nights in 2 rooms as golden Starwood Members and not only they have not given us any promised free room upgrade, but the housekeeping was absolutely awful and unsufficient for such a pretentious hotel. Room cupboards are very small and we have been obliged to keep everything in the suitcases. Bathrooms are gorgeous and large but...what for if the rest is so...poor. Breakfast with long lines every morning and...poor as well. Too high air conditioned in all the hotel. We have frozen. Better chose another hotel.

<Content>Fantastic hotel The Westin Sydney is a great hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. It is in a superb location, right in the centre of the city which makes it great for business and/or tourist visits. The staff have always been helpful and responsive. The rooms are stylish and very well appointed - the bathrooms are a particular highlight. The only downer about the rooms (as is the case in many hotels) is that they have old TVs, which look terrible in such great rooms.The building itself is beautiful. The breakfast (only food I have ever eaten at the hotel) is really good, although the restaurant gets extremely busy on the weekend which can mean you need to wait for a while for a table to become free. I've stayed here a few times now and have had consistently good experiences. While it is not cheap, it still provides good value for money. It would be my first choice hotel in Sydney.

<Content>Not for a honeymoon - go elesewhere A great business hotel, but when on a honeymoon they don鈥檛 seem to care.Location wise, the quality of the rooms, linen etc make the Westin a great business hotel 鈥?which I have stayed in almost 20 times, however I made the mistake of using it to spend a night in on our way outside the country I was horribly disappointed.Every other hotel (about 7 of them over a 1 month period) contained a letter from a manager, or at least an acknowledgement from the preferred guest line, yet they did not bother, no letter from the manager, no nothing 鈥?and I booked the room with the hotel itself 鈥?and it was noted.If you want a great business hotel, then this is it in Sydney, but on a honeymoon or something romantic then this hotel just does not know how to 鈥渃lick鈥?out of its business mentality.

<Content>One of the best in the world - no complaints for us We ended our two week Australian vacation at the Westin in Sydney and the easiest way to describe it is as icing on a cake. Everything about our stay was perfect. When we checked in at 12, we were escorted right up to our room. While we didn't have a view, we were so grateful to be able to get our room at that early time that we didn't care. The room is nothing short of luxury, with the bathtub being the best and most comfortable tub for one or two to enjoy. The rain showerhead was so good that I want the exact one in my home. The bed was like a cloud. One morning we ordered room service breakfast (by the way, one person full breakfast is enough for 3 people - it was enormous and an amazing value for $38 for room service), and just lounged in their cozy bathrobes. It couldn't have been more peaceful and wonderful.The gym is also fabulous. It is not just a hotel gym, but one that people in Sydney actually sign up for. It has classes, an entire room of cardio equipment and very well stocked weight room. We were incredibly impressed with this gym and can definitely recommend it, even for the biggest fitness buffs.Now, you really don't want to leave your room it's so wonderful, but when you do, you find that you are seconds away from the best shopping in Sydney. It is a 10 minute walk down to the quay, and the ferries where you can explore the beaches and the harbour life. We found the staff to be exceptional, as we had some faxes and important calls. They helped us through all of the business we had to do, as well as our tourist desires. We were sending things to Canada and they even helped us figure out the codes to dial.We don't give 5/5 ratings very often but this one deserved it.

<Content>Loved the Wesin! Rooms, Location the best Just spend a GREAT week at the Westin and could not have been treated better - from being able to check in when we arrived at 9:00 in the morning, to the large room with a view of the clock to the waterfall shower and huge tub - to the not charging for the extra bed for my daughter. We also enjoyed the breakfasts with all the fresh food and the useage of the Health Club and pool.The location was great - right across from Starbucks (cannot seem to do without my Mocha) and the ease with getting to Darling Harbor or Circular Quay as well as Hyde Park and the shopping areas. Easy access to the monorail as well.

<Content>A high quality hotel, ruined by terrible customer service. My wife and I stayed here for 4 days to kick off a long holiday in Australia.Despite the hotel being informed directly with our arrival date and time, it would have been nice of them to inform us that the Sydney marathon was running when we expected to arrive and effectively cut-off the hotel from the rest of the city. We were forced, after being abandoned by the taxi driver, to run through/across the runners in the marathon dragging our luggage behind us then walk 8 or so blocks to the hotel. Not fun after a 24hr flight. The bell boy at the hotel seemed to find this very funny. A top class hotel would have informed us of the problem beforehand and arranged some help - at least a bell-hop or taxi/shuttle on the 'inside' of the marathon to help with luggage.This terrible start was a real shame as the physical building itself is fantastic, the lobby great, the room was excellent and the bathroom very well appointed. If it wasn't for the marathon debacle and the laughing bell-boy this hotel would have got 4 stars.A short walk from the hotel to circular key (rocks, bridge, opera house) or Darling Harbour (loads of resturants and bars). Of course you are in the CBD which is quiet on weekends but buzzy during the week with lots of shops etc.

<Content>Great Hardware, Poor Service I have spent more than 100 room nights in various Sydney hotels over the past 3 years, with the bulk of them at the Westin. I have also stayed at the Four Seasons, Shangri-La and Hilton.WESTIN:Pros - large rooms, bathrooms with character and space, comfortable beds, central location for business and shopping, rarely crowded lobby, SPG points (my main motivation!)Cons - lax service (1 out of 2 room service orders are bungled up despite specific reminders), no recognition even if you stay 30 nights a year, room service menu limited and unchanged in 3 years, food in room and in the Mosaic restaurant is very poor quality for what you pay, in-room toiletry is standard issue Westin (poor), management is not very interested in feedbackFOUR SEASONS:Pros - excellent service, food is generally high standard and very accomodating, great location, great toiletry, fantastic views (if you get the right room), overall friction-free experience, and a hint of romanceCons - rooms are small and standard-issue except for the views(definitely not FS standards)HILTON:Pros - HHonors points, location is good for shoppingCons - incredibly small bathrooms (even after a room upgrade as a Diamond member), views into other office buildings from room window, crowded lobbySHANG:Pros - views (opera house facing rooms only - harbour view rooms face the bridge expressway!), rooms are decent size, good bar (Altitude)Cons - location is a bit out of the way, food is not very good (room service advised me that some of their room service food was made in bulk elsewhere and trucked in, so cannot be altered!), service generally laid back and lax, a very ordinary hotel and a world away from the usual Shangri-La standardsIn sum, I think the Westin is acceptable for a short business visit, but you pay too much for merely a competent room and good location. For frequent stayers, service levels at the Westin become an annoyance. The Four Seasons has the edge over all others due to location and service. It is now my pick. If only they had better furnished rooms and a frequent stayer program!Overall, the quality of Sydney hotels is a couple of notches below major Asian or US city hotels. It is really a sea of mediocrity at European big city prices.

<Content>Opulent Westin Sydney The Westin Sydney provided a brilliant end to a beautiful day and a fantastic start to our honeymoon. On 19 August we arrived straight from our wedding reception into the opulence of Westin Sydney. We were checked in immediately and within minutes in our room overlooking Martin Place. The room was immaculate and had every convenience we were hoping for. From the massive bath tub, Heavenly Bed and Heavenly shower to the minimalism of the room we loved it. Being our wedding night the room had a bottle of Sparkling Wine and a sweet honeymoon dessert waiting for us. The staff were always available to our every whim. Anybody wanting a beautiful 5 star hotel in the centre of Sydney should stay at the Westin Sydney. The view is only of the centre of Sydney鈥檚 cityscape but that didn鈥檛 bother us as the windows were the cleanest I have seen in a hotel, both inside and out and made us feel entirely at home in our own city.

<Content>Luxury and character Stayed for 4 nights in January 2006. Expensive but wonderful facilities, service and location. With so many modern hotels in Sydney CBD it was also wonderful to stay in an old building with real character.

<Content>Loved the Westin Westin Sydney is a wonderful hotel in a perfect location. Upon our early arrival the front desk staff was very kind and understanding of our 15 hour flight from the US. We were given a room immediatley. The room was spacious and modern. There was a floor to ceiling window with an amazing view. We were lucky enough to have a room on the 27th floor. The bathroom was also perfect. The rain shower was my personal favorite. The concierge was also very helpful. We had many great dinners in Sydney thanks to his knowledge and expertise. We only ate breakfast at the hotel. A bit pricy but good. The Westin will always be our hotel of choice when traveling to Sydney. Thank you for enhancing an already amazing experience.

<Content>Great Service, Location,  We stayed at the Westin for the first 4 nights of our Sydney Trip. We are platinum SPG members and were treated like loyalty. Got an upgrade to a corner suite. We also stayed using corporate rate, so we had a great deal. Here are the pros and cons. PROS:a. Very clean and modern hotel. Supervisor checks the room after maid/cleaning service has done its job and make sure its up to Westin's standards.b. Plenty of closet space to hang clothes and lots drawers, if you are here for extended stay.c. Close to popular shopping areasd. Staffs are young, but very friendly.e. Parking is expensive but very easy. Valet service is flawless and always on top of their service.f. Hotel is secure  safe. Elevator access by key card only. g. Recognizes SPG Gold and Platinum members.h. Club lounge has plenty of seats, space, and great service.i. Taxi service is always available.j. Bed was always made, bathroom cleaned well, extra towels always provided.k. Great floor to window view! CONS:a. Far away from popular restaurants and dining options (such as the wharf and the harbour). Walkiing distance about 1.5 to 2 miles.b. Very business like hotel, does not feel cozy or resort like. This is definitely a business hotel. c. The staff are very young (mostly under 30), may not be able to recommend or fulfill requests or questions more geared towards older clients. d. Internet acess very expensive... I think about 20USD per day.e. Club lounge has good breakfast, but lacks hot food (eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc).f. Dining options are expensive and very limited within the hotel.g. Most stores and restaurants around the neighborhood close down around 7pm, very little night life.Overrall: I think this is a great BUSINESS hotel, it is not very romantic or family oriented. If you are travelling to SYD for pleasure, stay somewhere else. But the service was great, staff friendly, and prices are good.

<Content>Nice hotel, overpriced ammenities The Sydney Westin is a beautiful hotel in a price CBD location. However, they overcharge for just about everything you touch. The most egregious example of this is the gym --- there isn't one. If you wish to use the 'health club' (which is barely larger than a typical hotel gym) you get charged $20 PER VISIT. In addition, upon checking in (despite being a Starwood Preferred Gold member) I was given a 4th floor room with a view of a wall. Remember, this is a $295/night hotel.Some other charges you should know about...Call from hotel phone to local landline: $1/minuteCall from hotel phone to local cell phone: $4/minute!!!Bottled Water: $6Internet Access/day: $24.95This is a nice hotel, no doubt about it. However watch out for being nickle and dimed to death if you aren't on an expense account (and even then your manager may have a few words with you).

<Content>Probably the best place to stay in Sydney overall There's no point staying at the shangir-la or four seasons in Sydney -- those institutions simply don't reach the profund levels of service they do at their flagship locations in Asia, Europe, etc. It's a waste of your money.The location of the Westin is perfect - it's where locals (not tourists) would think is the coolest location in town (as opposed to being near the opera house a couple blocks away -- which is corny.)You're steps from the good shopping, eg. famous local jewellers J. Farren Price, as well as the usual Chanel, etc etc. You'll enjoy the hustle and bustle of city Sydney. and the parks, etc.The Westin is in possibly the most beautiful old colonial bldg in Sydney - the old post office.Be SURE to get a suite in the old section of the building - ask them clearly.There are no particular views - if you want Harbour Views, go for one of the hotels on the harbour (i.e., a few blocks away).Run over to woollahra to Bistro Moncur for dinner, or what about inner-city cool Longrain (ask the concierge) or go to Iceberg's (overlooking Bondi beach) and time your dinner with the sunset. For village strolling/shopping, go to Double Bay or woollahra, in both cases a few minutes ($A10) in a taxi.The staff are all perfectly friendly and OK, like any hotel in Sydney.

<Content>Recommend The Westin We stayed here last week for four nights. Very comfortable stylish hotel with superb beds and fabulous staff. Breakfasts were great in the Club Lounge. We had Executive King roms in the tower block and thought they were good. Wouldn't have wanted a much smaller room. Hotel is in a great location. Can't commend the staff highly enough - all helpful, relaxed and professional.

<Content>good location As a tourist location, it is good. If you are looking for something closer to the opera house and ferries, try the sydney harbour marriott.Westin had good service, helpful staff with tourist question (very knowledge) and nice rooms. will not go wrong. Seems to be more business clients. Fun times.

<Content>Lovely hotel, well-located I stayed at the Westin Sydney on a business trip, but also had a bit of time for sightseeing. My room was in the Heritage section, facing the inner courtyard, so the view was nothing to look at but it was absolutely quiet. Although this is the old section of the hotel, it has been beautifully redone and the rooms are immaculate, with modern furnishings and spacious new bathrooms (no picture window from the bath, however). The Heavenly Bed is wonderful, and there was an actual walk-in closet with tons of space and an iron  board included.I arrived about 9 am on a weekday, and my room was not yet ready, slightly disappointing, but it only took about an hour and they provided the opportunity to freshen up in the health club while I waited. They were great about late checkout on the other end. The hotel is reasonably close to Circular Quay, although it's several minutes' walk. A couple blocks in the other direction is the Queen Victoria Building, and from there it's just a few blocks to Darling Harbour. Starbucks is just across the courtyard, and it's a short walk (about one long block) to the train station, making airport connections quite easy. I didn't spend much time at the hotel, but would definitely consider it on a return visit.

<Content>Stylish, warm and friendly We stayed at the Westin for Christmas and would thoroughly recommend the hotel to others. The service level was excellent - in fact the front desk staff could not do enough to help us. Our flight arrived at 0630 so we did not expect to be able to check-in until at least midday. However, we were allocated rooms immediately and in fact were upgraded so that this could happen.The room was a good size, not huge but there was plenty of room and tons of storage. The decor was unusual for a international hotel in that it was fresh, modern and bright. The 'Heavenly Bed' was very comfortable and the floor to ceiling windows provided a fantastic view of Martin Place.The bathroom was another novelty, with glass shelves and modern cermaic basins and best of all, a glass wall between it and the bedroom. You could sit in the bath and watch TV through the glass - perfect! The shower was another big plus point. It was a separate cubicle with a rain shower head so you really did get a good soaking.When deciding on hotel rooms in Sydney you invariably have to decide between harbour view rooms or rooms that provide good value. I have stayed at the Four Seasons in a Grand Harbour View room and it was spectacular. The room however was very small in comaparison to the Westin - and at least 拢80 per night more expensive! I would recommend the Westin for value and style and spend the savings you make on a nice meal down by the harbour!

<Content>Flawless property - but SPG members should keep some things in mind. It would be difficult to rate this property as 5 stars ONLY because of problems encountered as an SPG Gold member. Please read on: I had booked a deluxe room - which, as it turns out is in their older, Heritage wing (i.e. no view, low floor). I disagreed with their assessment that the room is deluxe, and asked to be upgraded. Starwood Gold means nothing to this hotel, and complimentary upgrades are out of the question. Thus, I agreed to pay for the upgrade for the first night, as long as the night on points would not incur an additional charge - I was assured that it wouldn't. I paid the AUD60, and pressed on. I was surprised to find an additional AUD116 on my bill at check-out. In fairness, they took care of it after some complaining, but it should NOT have happened. They are fairly flexible with the late check-out (4:00 PM), and they are a congenial group - but I couldn't get the bad taste out of my mouth, with the condescending comment about Gold members. They only upgrade (and cater to) Platinum members.

<Content>Great Location and Service! While planning our first vacation to Sydney we initially wanted to stay at the W Sydney as that is our preferred brand of hotel. Friends who have been to Sydney several times recommended the Westin as being more centrally located and still part of the Starwood group(we were using points for a free night). After seeing the actual location of the W we were glad we chose the Westin as the location was very central and close to everything and the W is in an out of the way location. We had a tower room that was beautiful and yes, the bathrooms are pretty spectacular! True there is no harbour view but I'm sure you pay a lot of money to get that view. Most days we were in or near the harbour and Circular Quay so that didn't matter too much to us.We upgraded to the Executive Club level which allowed us to access the club lounge and have breakfast every morning, which had a very nice selection of food and drink.I must commend the concierge staff of this hotel, particularly Gary Lee, who could not have been more helpful or friendly and made all of our dinner reservations as well as reserving tickets for us for a performance at the Opera House! A true professional who knows the meaning of customer service. Thanks Gary!Even though we are loyal W customers, we were very happy with the Westin Sydney for a great central location, a beautiful room and excellent service!

<Content>Great if work are paying! Just returned from a six night stay at the Westin (business trip). Location is second to none - right in the centre of Sydney and close to the harbour. Rooms were great - the bathroom a real plus and the staff friendly and attentive. There were a couple of bad points - $20 charge for the gym for the majority of guests and the fairly high price of room service. I've stayed at numerous hotels in Sydney and although this is one of the best, I would stay elsewhere if paying out of my own pocket as the Radisson, Sofitel and Medina are better value for money.

<Content>relaxing The bath is so amazing, you can lie in the bath, and see the City below. The TV had movies and I lay in the bath and watched a film. The shower was powerful and the room was immaculately clean. Breakfast was lots of fruit, dinky little vegimite sachets(took some home) and cooked, heaps of choices of all sorts, cereals etc. Location is brilliant for the City or harbour. I'd stay again but its so pricey, but it was a one off and I loved it!

<Content>Very pleasant stay We stayed at the Westin Sydney for 3 nights on a vacation. It was our first time to Sydney, and sightseeing was our sole purpose. I admit Starwood points was the initial draw to this hotel.First the negatives about the hotel. The hotel basically has no view except the standard city view. If you are really looking for a harbor view, this hotel is not for you. We did not have one, so we are not sure what we missed, but given that pretty much every day of our stay involved leaving from Circular Quay and moving through the harbor, we feel that we did not miss much.The hotel is also in a central business district. Great for business. Not so great for sightseeing. Although we did not miss the harbor views, we did miss being right on the harbor for the sake of convenience. We could walk to Circular Quay easily. However, it is a 15 minute walk and those extra 15 minutes when you are coming back from a long day of sightseeing. Also, everything in the immediate area pretty much shuts down on weekend evenings (as far as we can tell). The Rocks area or Darling Harbor had a lot more happening on weekend evenings.Now the positives (which there were many). Our room was great, and our bathroom even better. We were upgraded to a Heritage room in the old section of the hotel. My wife and I like sleek, modern hotel rooms rather than classical type rooms. So, we initially wanted to stay in the Towers. However, the front desk clerk recommended the upgraded and we trusted her. We were not disappointed. Once you enter the room, you get the feel of tradition, but appropriately balanced with a modern feel. We loved the room, and especially the walk to the room. You exit the lifts and walk across the bridge to cross the beautiful atrium between the Tower and the old building. You get to fully appreicate the architecture as you cross over, and for tourists like us it is a great feeling.The bathroom in the Heritage room did not have the window into the room that the Tower rooms have but it was large and very modern. Thebathroom amenities included everything that we needed including detergent.The basement area has a very modern, upscale food court that caters to the business people working in the area. A great place to pick up quick food at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to try out the hotel's restaurants.The concierge was very helpful in making recommendations for us.All in all, it was a great hotel. I would rank it as one of the top of the line Westins. If sightseeing is your main goal, the lack of being on the harbor is a slight downer. If you are in town for business, I think it is the perfect hotel.

<Content>Don't bother with this hotel I always do a lot of research before staying in any hotel and for this trip I was due to spend 4 nights in Sydney for the first time. I asked 5 people for their opinions and 3 recommended the Westin. Even Conde Nast had it down in their top 500 list. I asked one person what makes this Westin so different from any other? and was greeted with a trust me response. So I did. And my husband lived to regret it (as he bore the brunt of my complaints!!) Don't believe the pictures on the web site that show great pictures of Sydney views - I tried 3 different rooms and none had a view. The swimming pool is off limits at the times we tried to go there - 6pm on a Sunday evening for example when there's not much else going on anywhere else in Sydney. The rooms were no different to any other Westin - decidedly average. The fact that you have a bath next to a window is nothing to shout about. It just becomes a pain when someone needs to get up in the middle of the night and goes into the bathroom - the light is turned on and bathes the entire bedroom in light. You also need to be careful as anyone from the office blocks across the way could happily see you in the bathroom if they so wished.Housekeeping - obviously don't get the concept of do no disturb! We went out one morning and came back later in the afternoon to find our room had still not been made up. My husband went for a jet lagged nap and so I put the do not disturn sign on the door. Next thing I know, housekeeping are phoning me (and waking up my husband) asking when we want our room made up as we have do not disturb on the door. I advised them that I had meant it. No apology, just annoyance.The concierge service was also nothing to shout about. they gave us a great suggestion about the behind the scenes tour of the zoo, but ddidn't mention that this needed to be booked in advance of going to the zoo, so we were disappointed upon our arrival there. They didn't get our brideg climb sorted out as we'd asked so we nearly missed out on it, instead we ended up on the 7.30am climb (not ideal when on holiday!)I can't think of anything to recommend about this hotel, which disappoints me as chances are that was my one and only time in Sydney and i find that the hotel is as much a part of an experience in a City as the city itself.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, made the trip My husband and I stayed at the Westin, Sydney for 5 days in July, and it was one of the best hotels I have stayed at. We were in a standard tower room, which was beautiful, clean, well-staffed, and well-kept. And the bathroom! A huge soaker tub (sparkling clean, also) with room for two, a separate shower with a rain shower head, and glass for one wall (with a shade that could be lowered), which meant it actually had plenty of light inside, unlike most hotel bathrooms. The heavenly bed was. The location in the central business district is ideal for tourists, an easy walk to Circular Quay, the metro, or quite a few tourist sites. While it is a business hotel, it was also ideal for a vacation, and was the perfect hotel for us. I enjoyed every minute, and highly recommend it.

<Content>Lovely City Hotel This hotel has a fabulous ambiance to it and the rooms are gorgous. The hotel is built in an old post office building and guests can have either a post office room or a room in the sleek modern tower above it. I chose a tower room which had floor to ceiling glass windows with lovely city views. The bathroom has windows looking through the room so that you can sit in the tub and overlook the city lights. The location is great, right in the shopping district of the city and also a breif walk to the harbour front and all that Sydney has to offer.

<Content>Over-priced Stayed at the Westin last weekend for third anniversary. We got a discounted rate as Starwood Preferred customers (from 290-335AUD per night), and it was good but have experienced better in Sydney for that price (The Establishment for instance).The room - one in the GPO building 鈥?was spacious: high ceiling, large windows, lots of light and space. The windows looked down onto Martin Place. If you're there to explore Sydney, it's a good position between circular quay and the CBD, just no view (if you stay in Sydney and can afford it, you really should get a room with a view of the harbour). Overall, we were happy with the room and the service, I guess most of the things that weren't perfect related to us wanting a quiet, romantic weekend and The Westin being primarily a business hotel. The bathroom was big and beautiful - big bath and the walk-in robe was a plus, too. For the price though, there were a few irks:- room service was super exy ($21 for a baguette, $40 for a continental breakfast!?) and only went from 11am to 11pm. - the hot water from the basin peaked at luke warm. The shower was hotter, but not steaming.- the broadband connection was $24.95 per day (free normal internet via the TV, though).- without the Do Not Disturb light on, there were people knocking on the door it seemed every hour (for minibar or to make the room up.) And when the light was on, they wouldn't even knock to deliver room service! That's what you call Extreme Room Service.Anyway, I'm sure the room is fine for business travelers who don't mind paying for broadband and who charge everything to the company anyway, but for couples I'd suggest Sheraton on the Park (close to shops, 5min bus to cicular quay), The Establishment (hip little boutique around the corner from Westin), or something with a harbour view.

<Content>Excellent hotel and location My sister and I stayed at The Westin for 3 nights and could not find one thing to complain about. The room was large with 2 double beds with lots of natural light. Our room was ready when we checked in at 11.00 am and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The location was extremely central with a very short walk to Pitt St Mall and David Jones. A slightly longer walk to QVB and The Rocks (about 10 minutes each).After a big day shopping we decided to eat in the restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was fabulous.We would most definitely stay here again and I am looking forward to going back with my husband for a romantic weekend.

<Content>Probably the best location in Sydney All I can say is WOW. Firstly, the location of this hotel on the corners of Pitt and Martin Pl. has to be the best in all of Syndey. Everything - Circular Quay, Darling Harbour, Rocks, etc. is about a 10 minute walk.Lobby area is excellent, bright and spacious. Our check in took about 2 minutes and was very efficient. Everyone from the doorman to the check in staff were VERY professional and friendly. We got to our room and it was beautiful. Very spacious and immaculately clean. The bathroom was awesome with the glass wall. Heavenly bed and heavenly shower was truly heavenly.The head concierge Simon Rose was absolutely wonderful. He suggested some great places to eat and got us into Icebergs restaurant without a problem. Apparently that alone is tough.I've stayed in many hotels around the world and this has to be one of the better ones - not only for location but for quality. The property seems relatively new so everything is in great shape. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

<Content>Excellent We stayed 6 nights on vacation in March 2005 in a tower deluxe room for 拢137 a night. Before arriving I had regretted not booking a hotel with a harbour view but in the event was very pleased to have stayed at the Westin. The room was luxurious and classy, like the rest of the hotel, and well worth the price. Although it is a business hotel, its location was ideal, being central to all the main tourist attractions. There is an upmarket steak house plus restaurant in the basement (not part of the Westin) where we dined on 2 occasions. The hotel's bar served a great cocktail. Strongly recommended.

<Content>Nice! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a Friday and Saturday night, courtesy of a cheap(ish) deal on wotif. It was pretty damn great, subject only to a couple of service-style issues that I鈥檒l get off my chest before I rave. Unfortunately, first impressions were not great because it took ages to hand the car over to a valet, even longer for our bags to make it up to our room, and then too long again for our car to be brought around to the front from whatever distant galaxy the carpark is in. The staff were both nice and apologetic about the delays, but we were paying the big bucks to stay at this joint, so I鈥檓 not sure 鈥渋t鈥檚 busy today鈥?is such a great excuse鈥lso, extra money for the gym and the internet? C鈥檓on people, we鈥檙e paying over $300 a night, plus parking!Those gripes aside, though, the Westin was pretty fantastic. The rooms are lovely, furnished in a minimalist style without clutter, fuss, or anything French provincial. A good desk promotes the work ethic, the reading chair is ultra-comfy and there are more phones than anyone could possibly need. The TV had a good selection of cable stations, although the music stations were conspicuously absent. The bed was simply divine - I wanted to take it, and the comforter, home. There were lots of nice fluffy towels and two lovely bathrobes, which was just splendid because the bathroom was incomparable. It鈥檚 got a gorgeous shower, separate toilet, lots of bath-loot and a huge, deep bath, and a glass wall between the bathroom and the room that allows you to watch the tellie while soaking. There is a screen that can be let down over the glass wall for privacy, but it鈥檚 probably still not the most ideal setup where you鈥檙e travelling with the family or a business companion鈥?br/>Moving outside the room, the lobby is splendid. An impressive atrium connects the old part of the hotel (the old GPO building) to the new tower. It contains the usual assortment of hotel shops and cafes, but its still worth walking around just for the ooh factor. When we were there, the lobby was filled with convention-people in black suits carrying little convention guidebooks. There were surprisingly few denim-clad or camera-weilding tourists. The hotel itself is within (very) easy walking distance to Darling Harbour and the Quay. Great location. I liked this hotel heaps. It's central, convenient and you could do way worse than stay here if you want the 5-star deluxe experience in a central location. Take a photo of that bathroom!

<Content>Not up to Westin Standards I just returned from my sixth stay at the Westin Sydney and unfortunately it will be my last.After booking an Executive Suite for a total of 14 nights at a rather pricey $700 AUD per night, I was extremely disappointed with poor service including:a.) Multiple room service mix ups. Red wine being delivered when white was ordered and simple dining requests repeatedly being messed up. The service express personnel seemed genuinely concerned but unable to correct persistent room service problems.b.) Slack housekeeping with gritty bathroom floors, tables consistently smeared and a general lack of attention to detail. Repeated requests for housekeeping to be more attentive were ignored.c.) A bellman luggage mix up resulting in an overnight trip to the Blue Mountains stranding me without a change of clothing. When I rang the Westin to request that they send my clothing 1 1/2 hours away to the Blue Mountains they wanted to CHARGE me for their mistake.After numerous problems, I requested an upgrade to a luxury suite from Executive Suite category. Although the luxury suites were available, Westin Sydney management refused to upgrade. This is a hotel plagued with poorly trained staff from the kitchen workers right on up to management. They do not hold the service philosophy that I have found at other Westin hotels and lack empowerment to satisfy a guest.I will not be staying with Westin Sydney again even though I am a loyal Starwood Preferred Guest member.You are much better off in Sydney at the Park Hyatt for awesome views and top of the line service or the Four Seasons for reliable good service. The Westin is expensive and doesn't deliver service commiserate with the prices it demands.

<Content>Fab hotel Stayed in this hotel from 28th December until 2nd January. It was perfect - very expensive to stay over New Year but a great location.Left and right are the main shopping centres and everything - even the harbour bridge is within a manageable walk away. The Opera House and the bars around that area are within 10 minutes walk. Couldn't get a more ideal location.The staff were suberb, a different level of service. Bar drinks and meals were quite expensive though.The rooms were big: the bathrooms have a glas wall between bedroom and bathroom, but there is a blind to cover this if you are shy with each other! This means you can watch TV (but why would you when you are Sydney???) from the bath I suppose.They even have internet (email) from your TV which is cheaper than phoning from the hotel - although they do sell telephone cards.I went with my very fussy mum and sister again, and my husband. All round it was well worth the money to stay here for location and standards set.
