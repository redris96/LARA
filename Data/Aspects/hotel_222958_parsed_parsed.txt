<Content>The best part of staying at the Comfort Inn The best part of staying at the Comfort Inn was coming back to this web site and reading the bozo review (mostly from Europeans) who have criticized and posted here. I spent 1 week and would like to tell you about it. I arrived in Boston, got my Hertz Rental car and drove with map instructions to the hotel. I had a difficult time finding the place because the area has had major highway construction and rerouting of lanes. The work is finished but it really takes a skilled driver to find the place the first few times. The street in front of the hotel is divided and you can cross either by foot over the bridge, or on the street (dangerous to do so) if you want to go to the supermarket across the street. Use the bridge, save yourself.  Check in was fine and my room was above expectations. I used the shuttle the following day to go to the airport to retrieve people arriving from Japan and coming back was fine except that on using the shuttles, I noticed that each driver had a different way to get to and from the hotel. Unless you really need a car, don't bother renting one. Follow the instructions in the lobby and use the shuttle to the T (subway stop) pay $2 and go in town. Its easy, fast and you don't have to deal with the car.  Dining: The hotel has a free continental breakfast. There is a microwave in the dining room and you can use it for the oatmeal or hot cereal, hot chocolate, etc. or microwave your own food (at any hour you wish). The dining room provides make your own waffles, scrambled eggs, the usual cakes, toast, rolls, juices. Its not a big dining room but the European tourists that overloaded the hotel thought they were at a sidewalk cafe and the lines waiting to eat were annoying due to many people sitting and reading a paper while having breakfast. Generally it is sufficient, clean, and filling. There is no other dining option at the hotel. You can walk about 1 block to the bowling alley where there is an Italian sandwich shop and pizza, adequate but nothing great. Just okay from my point of view. Next to it is that Phillips Candy shop. At $23 a pound they don't give out samples and the employees act as if they are the owners of the place and keep count of every item. Next to it is the restaurant/bar. Its worth going to. They have a good menu, its like an English pub, many beers and cocktails, good service, the waitresses are patient and helpful especially in dealing with the tourists who did not speak English. I would go back there again even if not staying at the hotel. 4**** for the restaurant. The pool at the Marriot is available for use but I never saw anybody using it. You would have to carry your suit and towel there, walking 1 block or driving over there if you want to go for a swim. The noise factor from the T is not that bad. Maybe it is if you are in the rear of the hotel but the front was quite nice and there is plenty of free parking. The rooms have an iron and an ironing board and there is a laundry on the first floor. You can wash and dry clothes and the washer has an automatic soap dispenser which adds soap and fabric softner so you don't have to worry about obtaining it at all. Some of the staff on the front desk were not too bright and gave me directions which caused me to get lost while looking for a Target store. Others on the front desk are quite competent and accomodating. You can sit in the lobby or in the front of the hotel and have a cigarette and read a newspaper. Most of the guests were in and out all day long. This hotel is not really close in at all but the alternative is staying in central Boston at a much higher rate and generally in a dumpy downtown area. Boston is congested and not that clean in my opinion. The cleaning staff at the Comfort Inn did a very good job, were thorough and efficient. I am always amazed at the slobs who criticize here. Just take a walk through the hallways and look into the rooms that the maids are cleaning. Clothes on the food, bottles all over and debris in the room. These are the slobs that call everything filthy and post it here. Take a good look at the full length mirror and see who the slobs really are. I notice that many Europeans are critical when writing reviews. The very same people who camp in downtown areas in European parks and wear lederhosen or sweat outfits to fancy restaurants seem to think they are in Monte Carlo (playing the lowest denomination slot machine). I would recommend the hotel and would stay there, had no complaints for the 7 days we were there. Thank you .

<Content>Terrible stay at the Comfort Inn Boston!! This was probably one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at.First it wasn't very clean, our bed sheets were stained with blood as well as our pillowcases, didn't even look like the sheets were changed from the previous guests that were in the room. The hallway had a funny odor, then our internet never worked in our room, nor did our iron and the staff wasn't helpful at all. Also, the area is not that great that it is in either. Next night stayed at the Homewood Suites in Cambridge, and that is a much nicer area. Stay away from this hotel.....

<Content>good value, but with caveats There is nothing written in the other reviews taht i would disagree with. Yes it is close to teh T and a busy street, and planes fly right overhead. The shuttle to the T station/airport is crowded. The restaruant and pool are not on site but at the adjoing Ramada, owned by the same people.But consider that Boston is usually pretty expensive for hotels, espcially any closer to teh city center. I paid $134 a night, which was far cheaper than other properties closer in, and i was still easily able to get to where i wanted to go. Plus the free parking saves you the $20+ you'd pay downtown.If the weather is nice, and you dont mind walking, it is just over a mile to the nearest T station (not the one the shuttle takes you to), so i avoided the crowded shuttle. Coming back to the hotel was not crowded at all.Breakfast was wonderful, a little more than usually expected. waffles each day, plus other hot foods (including eggs) the other day. not sure why eggs were not both days, but i was very late to eat that first day.If you have kids, there is a very nice city beach/playground just behind the hotel. If you are a runner/biker/walker it is on the developing harborwalk trail system, which i ran on each day i was there, felt safe and was very nice.If you are a person who sleeps lightly or who would be bothered by any of the issues listed in the reviews - STAY AWAY, you wont be happy here. But if none of these things are things that you are really concerned about, this is a great value hotel for Boston.

<Content>Good value for the money We stayed 4 nights at this hotel and except for one night , had an enjoyable stay. The night in question was due to a large group of about 25 - 30 teenagers who checked in late and were loud, continuously knocking at each others' rooms, stomping and yelling the length of the hallways. Called the front desk to request that the group's chaperones be notified to settle their people down. Said they would but basically nothing changed till well past. midnight .That aside, unless you want to pay $350+ for a downtown hotel, this is a very good option. They provide a free shuttle to and from the airport. We waited an acceptable 20 minutes, after our call, for our pickup. The pickup location was across the immediate departure area of the airport and easy to find. We were joining a cruise and they also provided a free scheduled drop off to the cruise terminal. The hotel is located about three subway stops from the center of Boston and they also provide a shuttle to and from the Metro or T station. This shuttle runs about every 30 minutes but of particular note, the van can carry only about 20 people and serves not only the Comfort Inn but the Ramada Inn and as a consequence can fill quite quickly. There were a few occasions where people could not get on and had to wait 30 minutes for the next pickup with no assurance that they would be able to get on the next one. Think some kind of sign up system is needed.The rooms were clean and functional and unlike some other reviewers we didn't find traffic noise or any other external noises to be any problem at all, and we had a room facing the road. The free breakfast was very good and the selection was more than adequate. The immediate area does not have too many options for resturants. There is a resturant attached to a hotel (think it was a Ramada Inn) - the food was so so, but like some other reviewer mentioned, the service was abysmally slow. Eat in town before you return to the hotel unless you have time to burn. A sandwich shop, a Dunking Doughnut resturant and Bowling Alley Pizza place are closeby. There is also a large super market across the street with an attached deli. You can access the market through an overhead pedestrian walkway or a crosswalk with a traffic light immediately to the left and infront of the hotel.

<Content>Never again The train line ran just outside our room. Internet connection was terrible in the room. The ice machine was adjacent to the room ( I think it was the only machine . People from other floors were getting ice at this machine). The elevator was just outside the door. The shuttle was slow and crowded when we rode it to and from the train station. The eating area was small. The rooms were past due for renovation.

<Content>Not exactly a "Comfort Inn" I just stayed at the hotel (24 - 26 June 2008) and I must admit that the whole experience was very disappointing overall.I agree with the comments of previous posters that the resturants and the bowling alley were not connected to the hotel. They are owned by the same company and therefore it is possible to use the facilities of the other properties e.g. the swimming pool of the Ramada Inn.On our first night we were put in room 103 (I highly recommend that you avoid at all costs) which was next to the kitchen and breakfast room and we were woken up at 6am by the kitchen and the beeping from the waffle iron. We asked to move room and the second room that we were assigned was much better in terms of comfort and noise.The room was okay and the people that worked there were nice and were helpful and understanding of our problem. We booked this hotel after reading the write up on hotelclub.com which is inaccurate - this hotel cannot be in my opinion described as located downtown. The hotel provides a shuttle bus to the nearest T station which takes approx 10 mins and runs every half hour. We found it difficult to get a space on the bus as it was over subscribed and had to wait a couple of times for the next bus.

<Content>Avoid like the plague !! Heed my warning...and stay away from this place.There is a major traffic route into downtown Boston, directly in front of this Hotel. (CAR AND TRUCK NOISE)The subway and deisel commuter trains run less than 100 feet behind the hotel. (TRAIN NOISE starting at 5am. and finishing at 1am). And my personal favorite, this hotel is directly in the landing path for Boston's Logan airport (AIRPLANE NOISE). Depending on the wind direction you can get over 1000 flights a day flying over this hotel at (get this), less than 1000 feet. We had everything from 747's to Piper cubs flying over our heads, from 5:30 am to well after midnight.If you are a glutton for punishment, then this is the place for you.

<Content>Cost efficient hotel near Logan Airport We wanted a hotel for 1 night near Logan airport as we were catching a flight early in the morning. This hotel was only a 10 min drive to the airport and the free airport shuttle every 30 minutes was great and very convenient. Breakfast was also free and available early which helped as we had an early flight . We had a twin queen bed room which was very spacious and the bathroom was nice. Room was a bit dated but reasonably clean and had all the basics. Had free WIFI and decent TV channels. The hotel also has a swimming pool which was a nice add on. Staff were friendly. This is a good budget hotel if you need somewhere near the airport for a short stay. If you want somewhere for sightseeing in Boston then it is a bit out of the way of downtown as it is 3 miles north east of the airport.

<Content>Would Stay Here Again This is not the Ritz-Carlton as some reviewers seemed to want it to be. But, I had an experience nothing like the experience of the average reviews of this hotel. The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly, the shuttle to JFK/UMass station was 10 minutes late 1 time out of the 10 times we used it and the shuttle to the Airport was right on time at 6 am. Morning breakfast was your average waffles, bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, yogurt, etc and yes at times it got busy, but I never found it too busy that I couldn't even eat. There is free wireless in the hotel lobby and if you don't have a laptop, you can use the internet for $7 for 30 minutes. I never did use it, so I don't know how good it is. There isn't a restaurant on the hotel grounds, but there is on the property. Confused? The Philips Family owns 4-5 properties within a 5 minute walk, so there are 2 restaurants a block from the Comfort Inn attached to the Ramada and also a pizzeria/cafe in the bowling alley that they own on the property. There is also a grocery store, Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop across the street from the Comfort Inn. How inconvenient! (sarcasm)It is about 20-25 minutes from downtown Boston, but don't let that discourage you from using this hotel. For $15.00 you can purchase a 7 day Charlie Card and use the Mass Transit unlimited (Bus, Subway..etc). It also takes the headache out of getting around the city. The most interchanges you would have to make from the hotel to any part of Boston was 1 using the T line. Overall, I would stay there again. The distance to Boston wasn't bad and for the price, you can't beat it. It is good for travelers that don't want to spend over $200 a night just to lay your head on a pillow. I used this hotel exactly what I needed it for, to sleep. Oh yeah, I believe it is a pet friendly hotel, so your four legged friends can stay there.

<Content>Could have been too cosy! The hotel provides a courtesy bus from Logan Airport but as there is more than one Comfort Inn in Boston, ask the driver to which hotel he is going. We ended up at the wrong one and had to be taken back to the airport where the correct bus was waiting. We had a problem on arrival - we were told we had booked only one room and two double beds for four adults (two couples) for two nights. A bit too cosy for our liking. When we explained we had booked two rooms and showed paperwork givng an overall price of $600, the guy on the reception was still adament that we had booked only one room. And, we were told they were fully booked so another room wasn't available. It wasn't until we produced a copy of an email that confirmed the two room booking that further investigation was done and another room was found. Apparently not their fault but Venere who we had booked through. Moral of the story - take copies of paperwork. The hotel is basic but clean. Coffee facilities in the rooms. Good breakfast - freshly made waffles, fruit, yoghurt, muffins, coffee, juice - in a reasonably sized room. A shuttle to and from the nearest subway station to get in to Boston is provided. If returning to the airport, book your place on the shuttle as they fill up. Try the Phillips Restaurant about five minutes walk away (next to the Ramada Hotel) for excellent, reasonably priced food. The chocolate shop on the way back is too tempting.

<Content>Never Again! Where to start? For approximately $150.00 a night I got a room acrossfrom the elevators with an ice machine directly behind the wall opposite the bed headboard and the mass transit (T) lines running approximately 100 feet from the window. Between the noise of the T, which is above ground here, that runs until about midnight and the elevators and T again that start at about 5 AM, rest was marginal. The restaurants are about three blocks away. The walk is through a questionable area. Service at the tavern restaurant was terrible. I waited an hour for my food after ordering. Business was not that heavy. The people next to me waited a half hour to order and then left when no one showed up. The best service was a the bowling alley snack bar. The T shuttle was late or did not show up at all 2 of the 6 times I used it. The airport shuttle was the high point of this stay. The cleaning staff did do a good job.

<Content>What a mistake - we booked two nights My friend and I started and ended our mini New England tour in this hotel. What a mistake . The rooms were noisey ( we could hear next doors air con and the metro line behind us all night). There is no evening food available in this place but if you walked 5 minutes down the road there is a pretty good inn for food. The breakfasts were just awfull, it was cramped self service and over crowded. The most classic touch was the breakfast plastic cultery and paper plates. Dont stay at this place.

<Content>Bad choice My husband and I stayed only one night at this hotel, and we won't be staying there again. We arrived at Boston Airport at about 1.30pm and called for the shuttle bus. It took almost 20 mins to arrive, but the driver wouldn't take us and suggested we call for another shuttle bus. He gave no explanation for this behaviour. Another shuttle bus arrived about 5 minutes later and we got on but had to wait another 15 minutes for some other passengers. Then the driver had to pick up several more people from various locations, and the entire journey took nearly an hour (not the advertised 20 minutes).The room was ok, but a bit noisy. The hotel is on the flight path, has a very busy road on one side and a railway track on the other.There is nothing close to the hotel apart from a supermarket, and all the restaurants etc are at the Ramada Hotel down the road. We didn't feel like walking around the area as it looked a bit seedy, so we ordered take-away pizza from the nearby bowling alley.Breakfast would have been ok except that there was a tour group having breakfast when we were there and it was very crowded and there were long lines for the food.We booked for the 10am shuttle bus to the airport and it didn't arrive until 10.20am. I think there are better hotels than this one.

<Content>Never Again All the amenitites listed, which is why we chose this hotel, are at the Ramada Inn that is located down the road. We had looked forward to using the pool and going to the lounge after a long day of sightseeing. While you are allowed to use these as a guest of the Comfort Inn, it is an unsavory walk in the daytime - just plain scary at night. We had reserved a queen bed - got a double. Front desk was no help. We were told that when a room is reserved, it does not have to be the kind that is requested. Huh? Wouln't recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>quite adequate for us! this hotel was fine for us. the shuttle from the airport was fantastic - just call them when you land and they'll send it straight away. the shuttle to the subway station was great too - but as mentioned before it can get full and you have to wait until the next one sometimes - not much fun after a long day walking around boston! the first night we arrived we were pretty jet lagged, and about midnight there was a lot of noise in the corridor from a group of teenagers running up and down. i called the reception and within minutes they had sent security up to quieten them down. overall, was fine, a bit expensive though - $340 for two nights midweek including tax etc.

<Content>Mice! Twice! I have stayed at this hotel many times for work, as my company makes hotel reservations for me when I travel. The first time I saw a mouse in my room, I immediately called the front desk, and they moved me to another room. The manager said he was shocked and offered to take me to dinner the next time I was in town. He claimed that it was the first time that had ever happened. So, my company continued booking rooms for me there. The last time I was there, another mouse ran into my room -- even though I had all the lights on and the tv was on loudly to scare away any potential mice. They sent a maintenance person to my room without telling him why, and he showed up with a plunger instead of a mouse trap. This time, they didn't automatically offer me a new room -- I had to call the front desk again and ask. And in case you think the mouse wandered in, I was on the 5th floor of the hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, friendly staff This is a great hotel to stay in whilst visiting Boston, although a little bit out of the city a free shuttle runs every 15mins to and from the subway atation during the day and every half hour at night. If you want to get somewhere at a time when the shuttle is not running all you have to do is ask and they will put it on for you, we were picked up from the airport at about 11pm on arrival and were dropped at the subway station at about 6am on the day of our departure.The hotel was very nice and clean, there was a free breakfast in the morning and there was internet access though it cost about $7 per half hour. There was also a small gym in the hotel for use of residents. There are no restaurants around the hotel but there is a bowling alley which offers take away pizza.The only problem with this hotel was the shuttle is sometimes overcrowded and not everyone can get on, however it is never long before the next one comes along.

<Content>Good Value This hotel is situated a little out of town. If you're traveling by car, it's fine. For 90$/night, parking, breakfast and tax included, it's quite cheap for the Boston area. There's a free shuttle to the subway. The included breakfast is decent and the area has lots of space to sit people. When booking your room, ask for one facing away from the train tracks. The staff at the desk were very polite and helpful.

<Content>A bit far out of Boston This hotel was o.k. but a bit far out of town.There is a free shuttle service to the locat train station, and also free airport transfers which is very good, but i probably wouldn't stay there again as i would want to be nearer the centre of Boston.Free breakfast is adequate, and the staff are very nice, especially Ric, who sorted out a problem we had checking in as our booking had gone missing.Room was nice,This hotel is probably ideal for a short stay rather than a holiday.

<Content>OK for the price Stayed here for one night in September 2006 as it was a good deal cheaper than staying in downtown Boston.A cab from downtown will cost around $20 inc tip and I would advise this rather than public transport as the area around is a little bit random.Location notwithstanding we had a nice clean room with a good shower and what looked like an OK breakfast (I didn't have time) for $130. The check-in staff were helpful and there was a plentiful supply of courtesy buses.I would say useful if you need to keep costs down but otherwise a bit far out.

<Content>Loved the Comfort Inn - Boston We checked in late in the evening and were given a nice room for a very reasonable price. The service was great and the breakfast was wonderful. Our room was on the front, so the train did not bother us. We drove so there was no problem getting around. This hotel is very close to the Kennedy Center.

<Content>Good experience Let me first say that I am rating this hotel as compared to other hotels of similar caliber. As a 3-star hotel, I felt that the Comfort Inn was a very good value. It was certainly priced well below other hotels of similar ranking in the area, and the free parking, free continental breakfast, and free shuttle to the subway probably saved us another $50/day over hotels in Boston's downtown areas. The front desk staff was courteous, and since we arrived late in the evening they gave us a free room upgrade as the last available room was between the elevator and ice machine, and the hotel staff did not want to put us there (nice of them, I thought.) The room was perfectly nice, nothing fancy but clean and tastefully decorated. The subway line runs behind the building, and can be noisy at night if you are a light sleeper so maybe request a room at the front of the hotel. The shuttle to the T station ran every half hour, and we never had an excessive wait. There really isn't anything nearby as far as restaurants or attractions (save for the on-property restaurants and bowling alley) so one pretty much has to get on the T to get to almost anything.The on-property restaurants were nice enough, although it depends on what your definintion of on-property is. It is about a 2 block walk to the Ramada Inn, which is where the restaurants, bowling alley, AND THE COMFORT INN's POOL are. The area seems safe enough during the day, but I was very nervous walking from the restaurant back to the hotel at night as the area is a bit industrial and not well lit. The walk is especially bothersome if you plan on using the pool, unless you want to take clothes with you and change at the Ramada. In fact, I never used the pool becuase of this inconvenience.The continental breakfast was very good. Belgian waffles, cereal, and bagels/muffins/ toast, and fruit if you get up early enough to get it. This hotel seems to cater to a very international and family-oriented crowd. But, if you have kids who want to use the entertainment complex you might want to consider the Ramada instead to eliminate the walk.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a nice hotel at a good price. It is not the Ritz, but for a 3-star hotel it was more than adequate.

<Content>OK but...what you should know... Just returned from our stay at Comfort Inn Boston on Morrisey. At first was concerned about the rail line was just outside our room but when we set the A/C to Fan it did mostly drowned out the noise. Wasn't the problem it appeared it would be at first. Restaurants and pool several blocks way was very misleading when you look at their website it sounds like they are on property. It was a very good restaurant overall but the walk was more than we expected. It rained while we were there so could have been a problem. Staff was friendly but some of the information that gave about Trolley, times of scheduled shuttles, tourist info was not totally accurate. Didn't create big problem but could have been better. The housekeepers did not have a good grasp of stocking and cleaning in room coffee makers. Every night of our stay we had to go get cups, sugar, cream and even coffee for the next morning. Not very pleasing when you are tired and ready for bed. Coffee in the room was important to us and after telling them it wasn't serviced correctly the first night was shocked every night for 4 nights it was no better. Overall the room was clean, staff pleasant, and stay was nice. We had a good deal so the price was good and found it to be an OK place to stay. With just a few minor adjustments and a more accurate description on their website might improve others view of stay.

<Content>Out of the way hotel When arriving in Boston South Station, we took a taxi to this hotel because of our luggage. The website leads you to believe it is conveniently located on the outskirts of downtown, but it is not. It is much further. Our taxi fare was over $25, and that was with NO traffic to delay us. Once we arrived at the hotel, our room was not ready, so the man at the front desk stored our luggage for us. We mentioned we would be spending the day downtown, and he didn't mention the free shuttle to the subway station. We were going to walk all the way to the subway station(and it is far) but fortunately, the woman at Dunkin Donuts told us about the free shuttle offered by OUR hotel.We went back to the hotel, and took the shuttle.After spending the day in downtown Boston, we returned to the hotel, checked in, and asked for our luggage. The new front desk clerk couldn't find it anywhere. It turns out the morning clerk stored it in a different location than they usually store luggage, but didn't tell anyone.Our room was clean and large. It was comfortable and the bathroom was large. Keep in mind that half the rooms in this hotel are right next to the subway tracks, so you will have trains going by all night. Light sleepers may be bothered by this.While there are some restaurants and shops within walking distance, the roads are very unfriendly for pedestrians, with no crosswalks and curves everywhere. I would be wary of wandering around in what seemed like an unsafe industrial area.So to sum up, the free shuttle to the subway make it a decent hotel to stay at if you want to save some money by avoiding downtown hotels, but the location is not a good feature of this hotel. Plus the customer service by the staff is slightly less than satisfactory. I would stay here again for the rates as you can easily take the Subway downtown. However, if you book, please know what you are getting.

<Content>OK for price We stayed at Comfort Inn Boston as the cost was reasonable in comparison to most Boston hotels. The hotel sent a complementary shuttle bus to pick us up from the airport, which was really helpful. The hotel room was clean and comfortable. I had no difficulty with internet wireless access on my laptop in the hotel and this was complementary. Breakfast was included in cost also, which consisted of fresh waffles, muffins, bread, coffee, yogurt, fruit juice etc. I thought that this was good value as other 'better hotels' had charged us for all of the above, additional to our room rate, and the service was no better than the Comfort Inn Boston. On the downside, it is hard to believe that this hotel is advertised as part of a complex containing restaurants. It is a shorter walk to Dunkin' Donuts and the supermarket opposite the hotel than to the 'restaurants' on-site. There is a railway behind the hotel and though I occasionally heard some noise, it wasn't bad enough to cause any great problems.

<Content>not all it advertises to be A bit pricey for the quality. Booked through internet, was under the impression there was three restaurants close or on premises, and in-room internet. Instead, the internet connection was only in the lobby, and wireless only worked some of the time. The restaurants were a two block walk down the street, including walking where there was no real sidewalk. The rooms were of good quality, and were large enough to move around. The staff was friendly and helpful, and loved my dog. The shuttle to the subway was a real plus. I wouldn't have booked it for that price if I had known, though.

<Content>Comfort Inn, Morrisey Boulevard This review similar to Ramada Inn, sister hotels. Said had 3 restaurants and bar did not say was either a shuttle ride or 5 minute walk away at the Ramada Inn; ditto childrens entertainment. Subway line and commuter rail track at back of hotel and 6 lane freeway at front. Rooms clean, staff very helpful, shame about the railway line.

<Content>Nice, except for the trains.... We stayed here on 5/1/04Why hasn't anyone ever mentioned the railroad that runs right behind this hotel. I think that is a HUGE factor. It seems that the trains don't come by as often late at night. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly and accomodating. The breakfast is good. Plenty for all.

<Content>be aware I just stayed at the hotel (Feb. 13 - 15) and was very suprised when I got there. It says that the resturants and the bowling alley where all connected to the hotel and they are not. They even told us when we got there that the candy store and everything was connected. But nothing was. The room was okay and the people that worked there were nice. For the breakfast in the morning you should get down there early. There wont be a good selection if you wait untill about 9. They had bagels and some fruit mix some cereals and juice,coffee and hot chocolet...

<Content>Could have been better We stayed at this hotel for two nights in October. We use the T whenever in Boston. Pick-up from the T stop at JFK back to the hotel was unsatisfactory. Often people were left at the stop because the small mini-bus could not handle the load. The bus also services the near by Ramada. You then had to wait for the next bus. The advertised schedule was not adhered to. The breakfast was best described as meager. One elevator was broken for our whole stay so the other elevator had to do double duty. The computer in the lobby was broken for our stay. We asked that a mini fridge be delivered to our room. Upon arivial we found that our first task was to clean out the mold inside. Most people realize that they should not be stored with the doors closed unless they have been properly sanitized and dried out. There needs to be more attention to detail at this hotel. The stairwells were the cleanest I have recently seen though in a hotel. I discovered this as I got tired waiting for the one elevator.

<Content>For the money, well worth it We stayed here 27-31/10/03. The hotel is fairly typical travelodge affair. Rooms were clean and functional. Two adults and two kids. Breafast was OK and part of the deal, which as you are out and about seeing Boston was OK. The shuttle bus is good and free, takes you to the local tube/subway station, about 5 mins away. The cost into town is only $1 each person.If you are arriving by train, get off at South Station, then the red line outboard to JFK, two stops. If you fly in, the hotel will pick you up for free from the aiport. Just ring them when your plane gets in, about 15 mins away.Overall, good value for money, beware though, you can get very odd deals, so shop around. We were quoted $450 inc taxes for the 4 nights on US sites, however, we found a bucket site in the UK which did it for $270 inc taxes.

<Content>An honest view We stayed here in Feb 03 (2 adults, one teenager). The free shuttle the hotel provides to JFK/UK Mass T and the Airport is excellent. However breakfast is dissapointing (limited choice and everything served on polystyrene!) and the location means if you want any kind of reasonable entertainment/food in the evening you have to go back into Boston, (approx 15 minute shuttle, 10-15 minute T) There was one reasonable pub behind the hotel (3-4 minute walk across roads and in our case over mounds of snow)however as it is one of the few places that allows smoking, under 18's are not allowed in. Rooms ok-ish.

<Content>Be on time for breakfast!!! We where very surprised when we went down to get breakfast 5 mn before the end of breakfast time.The person in charge was very mean and didn't wan't us to have breakfast. She was saying that it was too late and was unplugging the toaster coffee machine etc in front of us to make sure we could not get anything.A VERY BAD WAY TO TREAT GUEST.Otherwise the hotel is ok, but the staff is not as friendly as it is written in their brochure.
