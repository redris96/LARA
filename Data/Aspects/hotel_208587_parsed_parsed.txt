<Content>Awful, with ROACH in room Terrible and dirty place. We had a roach in our room the first. The owner told us he would give that night free and then did not follow thru on that promise when we check out and paid. The 2nd and 3rd nights we spent in the hostal since we demanded to moved after the roach. That room was a little less stuffy. But you still felt dirty after you showered and the hall bathroom smelled very strongly of urine. Will never stay here again. The worst part of our trip.

<Content>Sufficient I wouldn't necessarily go back to the Hostal R. Capitol, as I found it a bit old and crumbly for my taste, but it has a couple of redeeming qualities: First, it is located right on the Ramblas, and there's hardly a more perfect location for those who enjoy bustling activity in their immediate environs. Second, I was extremely grateful that I was able to book the room shortly before 10:30 on a Friday night, arrive about an hour later ... and check out around 5:30 the following morning. The helpful gentleman at the front desk, on duty all night long, was undaunted by the unusual (but, in my case, necessary) hours.In short, this would not be my first choice for Barcelona accomodations, but if you need an inexpensive room in a pinch, Hostal R. Capitol suffices.

<Content>Cheap but maybe not so cheerful Just come back from a 4 night stay at Hotel Toledano. Room was very small with twin beds but acceptable as you don't go to Barcelona to stay in your room. Our Hotel reception was on the 4th floor but our accommadation was on the third floor like many other reports feedback. Our bathroom was the smallest you ever did see and was not particularly clean either. Need to be up early as it seems when others have the shower on as well the water pressure drops to a dribble. Next doors toilet flushing was enough of a wake up call - so no alarm clocks needed. Hotel walls were very thin so I wouldn't recomment this accommodation to a light sleeper. We paid 68 euros per night for the room, with then 7% taxes on top so the price was good and the location on the Ramblas was great. I would consider staying there again if there were no other availability but I certainly wouldn't want to take my 2 year old son.

<Content>Just fine for a place to sleep I found the place to have an outstanding location, right on the Ramblas, for seeing all that Barcelona has to offer. I can't imagine going to an amazing city like Barcelona and wanting to spend a lot of time in a hotel. If you just need a place to sleep at a reasonable price in an unbeatable location you will be fine here. If you are a real demanding person who wants lots of amenities, you'll prefer to go someplace else. My room was clean, everything worked, and the people were unfailingly courteous. And the moment you step outside the front door you are in the heart of Barcelona.

<Content>OK but I wouldn't come back We stayed in the Hostal Capitol a few years ago and that was fine so this time decided to stay in the Hotel Toledano part of the building. Elevator was not working when we arrived so had to carry our bags up 4 flights of stairs. Checked in on the 4th floor but our room was actually on the third floor through another locked door saying Hotel Toledano. The room was half painted and half plastered and smelt of damp or wet paint or something. The room was quiet as it was at the back of the building away from the street but you can hear people in the other rooms. The bathroom was very dated and I didn't like to touch the shower curtain. On reflection, I don't think there was really any difference between the hotel and hostal rooms. We paid 70 euros per night which seems expensive for the standard of accomodation. There is free internet which is good but I wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Never again The room was small, cramped and dark. It only had two small lights which made it difficult to read. When I booked the room, I asked for a room with a balcony...they said that they had a room available with a balcony and a view of the cathderal. The balcony view was on the backside of the hotel and I barely had a view of the cathderal. There was a small hole in the wall by the nightstand. The lock on the door was hardly adequate. I asked for a different room and they said that they had none available. The room was clean. Not worth 59 Euro a night, even though it was in a prime location. I would of changed hotels, but it was already paid for, and this was at the end of my trip and I was too tried to make the effort to look for another hotel

<Content>ROOM 204 - Not if you want to sleep! Followed Rick Steves to this hotel. It is right onthe top of Las Ramblas, the main tourist drag in Barcelona. Our room (a barely passable triple with three single beds) overlooked the Ramblas. Problem is that partying goes on on the street below till 2am on the street below and sleep was impossible til the noise died down. We were grumpy and unhappy for a good part of the visit as we were sleep deprived. Rooms in the back of the hotel might be better, don't know. Also, noise from the lobby, including the security buzzer, passed directly into the room as the room door is about 40 feet from the front desk. I would not recommend this room (#204) even though 74E per night was reasonable for a major city.

<Content>Never going here! We are a group of 5 friends and we,re going to tell you our terrible experience at this HOSTAL.We arrived at the hotel, and how was our surprise when we saw that from the third floor in which is the Hotel located, the recepcionist lead us to the second floor when they have got the HOSTAL (with a different name). The prices for Hotel and Hostal were different, but when we paid the first night, we paid for the Hotel prices (in fact, in the Bank receipt, it appeared the concept with the name Toledano Hotel). We raised to claim, because they were accomodating us in a lower category that was not the one for what we had paid. At any moment we were conscious that you cannot request luxuries to a 1 star Hotel, but the rooms were more than dirty: you must have seen the hairs that were in the bath of our room... The recepcionist incriminate us saying that we have called him swindler, and that we had getting the room dirty just to annoy him. After 1 hour discussing with him, we found another Hotel, and he refused to give us the complaints book.. still we are regreting not to have called the Police.It,s incredible that still are places in which they treats the customer such a garbage.

<Content>Hotel Toledano Be aware of this place if booking over the phone or from their webpage. No warning of cancellation fees is mentioned anywhere! I booked a room one week in advance over the phone. The owner of this hotel took my credit card details and said I would be charged on arrival. However, when I called the day after to let them know of a change of plans, they took money illegally out of my credit card. The owner stated that all cancellations made before 15 days were subject to a charge 40EUR or more. I argued that I had only made the reservation the day before and had received no warning at all of these charges. His reply was  I don't care and shortly put the phone down on me. Thankfully, my credit card company arranged to have the illegal withdrawal fully refunded to my account.

<Content>Great value for an excellent location We stayed at the Hotel Toledano and for only 鈧?9 per night we got a clean double room with a good hot shower and a balcony. The rooms are not massive but were a perfectly fine size for sleeping, getting ready and going out to enjoy the excellence that Barcelona has to offer - when you have a great city you don't want to spend your time in the hotel. The staff are very friendly and efficient and will organise any help you need during your stay (they speak good English too).The room was cleaned each day (properly cleaned too as we came back one day and the maid had moved the bed for sweeping under) and we were given plenty of fresh towels every day.The reception is good with 24 hour staffing. There are vending machines for drinks (the expresso is not bad for a machine either!) and the prices for these are very reasonable.The only point potential guests should consider is that you are right in the heart of the city so there is a lot of noise around you for most of the 24 hours in a day but then you don't go to Barcelona for a quiet weekend!Other reviewers have not given such favourable reviews but I suspect they were staying in the Hostal R. Capitol part. For me the Hotel Toledano was great value for money and I would be happy to stay there again.

<Content>Found on internet Both the Hotel Toledano and Hostal Capitol can be reached via this site, and it's a great one with a virtual tour, webcams, photos, a map, directions, rates, booking info -- the whole nine yards. Owned by the same family for decades, they are an amazingly good value. For instance, we had a triple with balcony overlooking Las Ramblas and a sink for just $47 per night. (Note: We could have had an interior room with a bathroom, but we wanted the view, and the well-maintained communal bathrooms and shower were right next door anyway.) In any case, these accommodations are perfect for anyone who cringes at the thought of squandering hundreds of dollars a night to sleep. If you absolutely, positively must have luxury, go for the Ritz or Le Meridien (where the Rolling Stones stay when they bring their bad -- albeit burned out -- selves to Barcelona). On the other hand, if you're out and about for 17-hours a day and just need a room to leave your luggage, grab a little shuteye, and take a hot shower before hitting Las Ramblas again, they're right for you. Incidentally, reservations are always advisable, and using this link, getting them couldn't be easier.

<Content>A very AVERAGE stay I have stayed at this hostal twice; once in 1997 with my mom, dad and sister and the last time this past July with my husband. Let me explain that both experiences were completely different. Hotel Toledano is really a HOSTAL, so if you're used to staying at hostales or pensiones in Spain there will be no problems. El Toledano provides a TV, bed, desk, airconditioning (a rarity, really, even if it spits out air at 85 F), and a bathroom with hot water. The first time we stayed, we were in a room overlooking the Rambla with a balcony. IT was a great room. We had a great experience. This past summer we stayed in the smallest double I have ever seen in my life. There was a little tiny window facing a wall, airconditoning that, quite honestly, was necessary because the window would have offerend no ventilation. A bathroom that probably would break fire stafety standards even in Spain. Mold all over the bathroom. One foot of space around the bed to WALK or PUT YOUR SUITCASE, not both at the same time. A TV and a very dirty comfortor on the bed. Since it was a hostal, and we paid only 45 euros a night, I accepted these conditions. When I complained to the staff after the first night- the sheets were not changed, the comfortor rolled up in a ball and placed under the DESK, the bathroom not cleaned properly, I was met with indignation. It IS a family run business, and of course the person at the desk will defend his family. Understandable. I will not stay here again unless I can get room with the balcony overlooking the Ramblas. For $20 more a night you can get a 3 star hotel on Expedia.com. This hostal is just not worth it.

<Content>Good central hotel, free internet I am at Hotel Toledano in Barcelona right now. I read the reviews on this site after I booked and was quite concerned. The room is small, but clean and everything works. Hot water. Toilet has powerful flush. Fine for me. They are located excellently on La Rambla, yet the room is quiet. Easy to find after dark from the Metro (Catalunya). Best of all they have free internet and are trialling Wi-Fi (doesn't work in my room but good at reception). Excellent value hotel in my opinion.

<Content>Good place to stay Since 1997 we are staying at the Toledano (or sometimes the Capitol as well) once or twice a year.Of course it麓s not the Hilton, but we always found friendly personal and clean rooms. The place is located very close to the Placa Catalunya, everything is within reach either by foot or using the metro. It麓s a safe place to stay for an affordable price, in course of time we made friends with the Toledano staff and we will stay there again as soon as possible !

<Content>Damp, Smelly Christmas We were unfortunate enough to be exhausted, broke and looking for a room in Barcelona last Christmas. Instead of turning us away, the bearded manager led us to a room that, after we'd settled in and had time to look more closely, made a derelict stable look good! There were no horse apples on the floor but it sure smelled like there ought to be. The dirt was ground in. The staff were not very respectful when we complained later about the dirty conditions and the smell of fish coming from the mattress. This Christmas we'll be staying in a better hotel in Barcelona - one that at least has fresh straw on the floor. A cardboard box would look good after that experience. If you do try the hotel Toledano/ Hostal Capitol, better pray there's no room at the inn.

<Content>Spain Marque at Hostal Toledano On reading the advertizing, I didn't think I would become the marque! In Barcelona so far I've had my bag snatched outside Satns station, had my pocket picked in Plaza Catalunya and most recently had my room robbed at Hostal Toledano/Capitol. I had 2 cartons of cigarettes and CDs stolen from my room, however the Manager was disbelieving. He said that his family had run the hostal for 80 years and never had such trouble before. He showed me receipts from guests for valuables for safe keeping - I asked him if I was supposed to keep my cigarettes in his safe! At the police station the police treated this theft as hotel staff perks! Why is everything run by surely young women with an adversion to men? Tourist information, train information and airport information offices have women who try to give you as little information as possible. This is usually after waiting in a queue whilst women are given brochures, leaflets, timetables.... the works! - Then it's back to reading their novels! I don't mind being stopped by customs and having all my luggage unpacked. However, I do object to being treated like a criminal while everything is looked at suspiciously. At the end of the search when nothing is found, a remark such as sorry to have troubled you or even thank you for your time would help! - You feel like saying to them yes - it is a razor, not some strange James Bond device. Any real terrorists and they wouldn't have a clue! - Still, they do confiscate masses of nail scissors, cutlery etc and think they are doing a good job! Barcelona is a beautiful place, it is a pity that the people spoil it! By the way - I haven't mentioned all the beggars and winos in La Ramba.

<Content>Don't waste your money There isn't too much I can say about this place other than it is the worst place I've ever had the misfortune to stay in. Filthy rooms; disrespectful service from the staff; damp, mouldy and appliances not working. Their website is deceptive too. This experience made my trip to Barcelona an unpleasant one. I only wish I'd been aware of tripadvisor's website before I booked - the reviews rating it as 'terrible' say it all about the Hotel Toledano/ Hostal R. Capitol!

<Content>One Hell of a Hotel As a taoist, this hotel rates worse than the eighteenth level of taoist hell where your torturers are the staff meting out the suffering! When we found our room flooded and filthy the staff not only did not respond to our request to have it cleaned; they were sarcastic and rude to us. Eventually we cleaned the room ourselves. It felt like we were in the bowels of a half-dead, reaking animal carcass where the walls were mouldy, things were broken down and not forgetting the damp, flooded floor. I would definately not recommend this place to anyone with any concern for decent hygeine or service.

<Content>Hotel Totallyawful I麓m puzzled by the two good reviews of this place on this site. Perhaps they were written by the hotel staff? In any case, the room we paid for was the worst I麓ve ever stayed in - filthy, in bad repair, shower not working, mould on the walls, no heating and water coming in through the window. The management were abrupt and not interested in hearing my requests to get a room that was usable. This is one place to be avoided. The location and price don麓t justify staying here. Better to pay a little extra for a decent hotel in Barcelona.

<Content>Clean and friendly I think this is a well run hostel. You pay for what you get. It's a great location and it's clean and tidy. It's also family run so not much fear of being robbed. I enjoyed my stay here but if you want luxury it's not for you.

<Content>Best combination price-location If visiting Barcelona means you're going to stay all day in your hotelroom, Toledano is definitely not your best choice. If, on the other hand, you just need a clean place to sleep, there's nothing wrong with it. Nothing else can beat the price  location. Don't forget to ask one of the guys behind the computer at the reception which restaurant they choose when they go out with friends and you'll get great tips (at least we did).

<Content>Can't beat the price or location, but can beat everything else! The hotel is in an excellent location for Las Ramblas, the Gothic Quater, the Metro (same line as the main train station) and the main square where the Bus Touristic leaves from. The hotel is cheap, but certainly not the cleanest! I couldn't see dirt, but it was dingy.I found the staff quite friendly, and all fluent in English. But the rooms are TINY and I wore flip flops in the shower too - a little grungy. If you're after location and price - it's a decent place to stay... but bring shower shoes and a bed sheet to keep clean!Rooms do have TVs with BBC World!

<Content>dirty rooms + bad service = bad hotel I'm not really sure why this hotel comes so highly recommended in guidebooks maybe bc it's cheap. That was the best part about the hotel. The man behind the desk wasnt exactly friendly. I think he tried to take advantage of us bc we were students backpacking around europe. He brought us to this other section of the hotel down a floor and across a dark hallway where they had other rooms. The floor was tiled white but was practically brown, the whole room was barely large enough to fit the bed, and the bathroom was dingy. There was a lot of mildew on the tiles in the bathroom and when you took a shower condensation would form all over and the ceiling would start dripping. We asked to switch rooms ab 20 minutes after we arrived and the guy told us we couldn't switch bc we'd been in there too long. anyway we decided to stay there bc we were too tired to go anywhere else and we wore flip flops into the bathroom to save ourselves from athlete's foot. Our neighbors were a little loud one morning and we could hear them talking and watching tv at 6 in the morning. I guess if you plan on never staying in your room and just sleeping there, it's a good place... otherwise stay away!
