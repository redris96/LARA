<Content>Good hotel but get a harbour view My husband and i stayed here in a harbour view room for 3 nights on 9th Nov 2008 with our 18 month old son. We arrived late in the evening after a long long flight and check in was great and really friendly. The rooms are great we had harbour view but cityside would have been very dull. The bed was HUGE. Once you get a travel cot in the room not much other room but it was fine. We had room service most nights and the food was very good and reasonably priced because Sydney in general is quite expensive! We were bb and the breakfast is excellent choice and quality. The only thing is this hotel is not very child friendly and although we enjoyed our stay they are more geared to business people.

<Content>Beautiful views Stayed here for 2 days on recent visit to Sydney. The location is excellent, definitely the best part of Sydney for tourists. Loads of really good restaurants and bars, spoilt for choice. The hotel was absolutely fine, good sized room, comfortable and clean. Worth getting a room with a view of the harbour, it does add to the holiday atmosphere.

<Content>Loved it! This hotel was just fantastic. My partner and I booked it for the night he returned from a month long trip home to Saudi Arabia. It was such a wonderful hotel - the room was beautiful and the view was fantastic. I had some initial doubts about the view (it's not on the side of the Novotel, Ibis, etc, where the best views are) but it was still beautiful. The room was extremely comfortable and the service was great - we ordered a club sandwhich for a late breakfast and it arrived within 15 minutes.It is the best hotel I've stayed at in Sydney, hands down.

<Content>Good location at darling harbour We had a layover in Sydney and chose this hotel right in Darling Harbour. Like most big city hotels it was crowded and bustling with activity. Convenient location for anything on the harbour - ferry, aquarium, restaurants, shopping, sightseeing, etc. The concierge made a great recommendation for dinner - Coast at Cockle Bay Wharf - short walk from the hotel. Absolutely, the best swordfish I have ever had! Restaurant service was excellent too. Hotel was also convenient for an evening ferry to see the Harbour Bridge and Opera House lit up at night.

<Content>Great hotel,great location Stayed at the Four Points for 6 nights in October. Were upgraded to a harbourview room... fantastic views day and night. Room was very spacious, amenities fine and spotlessly clean. Staff were universally charming and helpful. Can't comment on food as we only had breakfast a couple of days. Very good location for entertainment, bars and restaurants. 3 minutes walk to the ferry for Circular Quay and 2 minutes to the bus stop for the hop-on/hop-off  buses. Would choose here again.

<Content>Where was ther service We stayed here with a few issues to mention. On the first evening we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant, never again. the food was ok but the staff werent exactly consistant with what they were doing. we initially didnt get charged for a bottle of wine nor sparkling mineral water. however the waiter realised and broguht us another bill about 15 minutes later. Understandably they were busy but in the world of technology how did we get served the wine and water without it going through a system, definately not sure. We used the automated check-in system which overcharged our card but management seemed apologetic even though reception didnt really careThey have a long way to improve but maybe slowly getting there.The location was fantastic

<Content>Great hotel This was my second stay at the Sheraton on Darling Harbour in 2008. I was impressed (both times) by the standard of service. All staff were very welcoming and helpful at all times. I had a twin room harbour view (both times) which was excellent. Very comfortable bed and the room furnishings are adequate. I was impressed with the airconditioning. One of the few times I have found airconditioning that was comfortable, quiet and not needing to be adjusted or turned off at night! Another plus.....the walls are very well insulated so noise from nextdoor isn't an issue!The breakfast in the restaurant was a good standard and also catered for my gluten allergy without a problem. Very well located, within easy walking distance of Darling Harbour and the CBD. Will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Solid business hotel I stayed here twice over the course of two weeks. The location in Darling Harbour is very convenient. Restaurants, bars, shopping, and tourist spots within easy walking distance.My room during my first visit was a reasonable size King facing the harbour. However, for my second visit I got a very small size king room where I was pretty cramped. Be sure to specify that you do not want one of the small rooms.Housekeeping was OK, but they did not consistently provide the door hangers to order the breakfast. Calling directly resulted in prompt service though. Food was acceptable.

<Content>Reasonable room for Darling Harbour The number of hotels and serviced apartments dotted around Darling Harbour servicing the Syndey Convention centre makes choosing hotels a difficult one. Proximity for conferences is important, but so is comfort after a day of meetings.The Four Points is on the fringe of the City, bordering Cockle Bay side of Darling Harbour - the monorail is 3 mins walk and walking to the Convention centre is a good 10 minutes away. Restaurants at Cockle Bay are nice looking but usually average in quality,We were upgraded to a Harbourside suite - an enlarged standard room with the addition of a sofa and balcony overlooking the water after booking at $315/night. The room was comfortable, looked new enough, bedding comfortable and bathroom midrange. Whilst our room was quiet on the 8th floor, a friend was in the same style on the 3rd floor which was way too close to the expressway directly under his balcony.They were renovating their Corn Exchange restaurant, so brekkie was in the ballroom - a comprehensive, but uniformly uninspired array of standard buffet fare for the money. Really nothing special.Nice gym set up, but no pool, sauna or spa. Overall, a comfortable stay - to be expected for 4 star, but no bargains here. You get what you pay for.

<Content>Perfect base to shop, eat and explore My wife and i stayed one night recently for our joint birthday celebrations and loved the hotel and staff. We had a king room with great views of darling harbour and had breakfast included at the hotel restaurant also. Upon arrival the staff were all very friendly and helpful from the parking and baggage staff to reception and the restaurant. The breakfast was fresh, tasty and varied and the room perfect for a quick stay. What a position right on darling harbour and close to chinatown and the pitt street shopping area. Perfect couple of days in sydney and good value for money. we'll be back for sure.

<Content>Not worth the price or it's star rating Every time I book at Four Points, I assume it will be better than it ends up being. I know that Starwood has been trying to upgrade this brand to bring it more in line with its other brands, but it still falls short. This hotel in particular, while a great location in Sydney (especially for tourists visiting the Darling Harbour area) just isn't up to par given the price tag. I had a Harbour View room on the SPG floor (the view was good), but the room was incredibly damp, even allowing for the fact that we were three blocks from the water. The cielings were quite low, making the bathroom dark since it only had one light. It was rather ironic, in that I read the Starwood brochure provided in the room, and it said one thing that Four Points had was a good shower - and this shower was not very good. Even the furniture in the room needed updating. The prices for all services - room service, in-room telephone, and Internet, to name a few - were all more expensive than the Westin Melbourne where I had stayed previously.After I arrived and got settled in, I checked out rates for the 5-star Sheraton on the Park across town. For the subsequent nights I had in Sydney, the Sheraton was the same price - so I checked out early the next day (the front desk was very accomodating, so a thank you to them) and transferred.It's not that the hotel overall was bad - probably 3 stars overall, and definitely suitable for tourist groups - but given the higher perception that the hotel gives on its web site and the newer, more upscale look Sheraton is trying to put on this brand, I can't give it more than the 2 stars.

It didn鈥檛 smell very nice either but then I didn鈥檛 eat there. Very slow check in  totally lack of interest from reception.If I got a good deal I might have considered to stay there again but the stench of air-freshener gave me a pounding headache means I won鈥檛 stay there again.

<Content>Great Stay! This hotel was fantastic! My recent stay at Four Points brought back fond memories of a short stay at the Sheraton Mirage Port Douglas almost 15 years ago, where my family and I enjoyed hotel hospitality at its finest. On this recent trip to Sydney, I contacted Four Points after a terrible experience at the Saville (Bond St) and was immediately accomodated with a City side suite at a comparable rate (to the Saville) and was also offered a Habour view room. The lovely reservation operator was also conscientious enough to enrol me into their Starwood Preferred Guest program in order to accrue loyalty points.The following day I arrived at Four Points just after 12pm and was greeted by the polite and friendly concierge and doorman. My bags were immediately taken by the concierge who assured my the bags would be sent to my room once I was checked in. The bags were promptly taken to my room.At check in, I was amazed that despite the 3pm check in, my room on the 10th floor was actually ready so I was able to organise myself and settle in. The City side view was fine and the noise level was pretty low particularly at night.The two night stay was very comfortable and the 24-hour, well equipped gym made the hotel all the more accessible. The service was excellent and room quality was outstanding, despite the room being a little bit small.The staff were always attentive and ensured guest comfort. I will no doubt, return on my next trip to Sydney.

<Content>Average hotel in great location Stayed at the Four Points for a week on business. As a hotel, it's fine but not exceptional. My overall conclusion is that it's not making the most of its excellent location.The location is certainly fantastic, right by Darling Harbour - you can be on the boardwalk within a minute of leaving the hotel and this means that there loads of bars and restaurants literally on your doorstop. In addition, the main shopping area is only a five minute walk away in the other direction. Although the view from my room, onto the harbour, was wonderful, overall I would say that the bedroom and faciltiies were average. The room was slightly on the small side for what I would expect, it had an OK bathroom (which was functional rather than impressive) and a sense that the fixtures and fittings were starting to wear thin. All in all it felt like it's time for refurbishment. .I didn't use the restaurant but did make frequent use of room service. The service itself was slightly above average but the quality of the food was average to poor - a shamefully lame plate of fruit offering being a noticeable weakness. The lobby area gives a good impression of size and is relatively grand, but the corridors felt a bit gloomy. There isn't a hotel bar in the traditional sense - more like a pub tagged on the side. This was fine and although it didn't feel like it was part of the hotel I found that a good thing. Felt comfortable being in there by myself.

Close to Darling Harbour nightlife and ferries. 10 minute walk to downtown and circular quay or take a government ferry and get a scenic cruise as well. (Leaves form Pier 26) Rooms were comfortable. Get a harbour view if possible.This is a big hotel so bar and breakfast area get very busy when full. PP Mandurah, Western Australia

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Four Points Darling Harbour for 5 nights to start off our honeymoon. The hotel is in a great location, 3 minutes walk to lively Darling Harbour restaurants and Bars as well as the Aquarium. You can easily explore Sydney from its central location, a 15-20 minute walk to Circular Quay or the Rocks, or you can take a ferry which is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Service was overall average as were the rooms. I wasnt expecting anything spectacular and that is what we got. The common areas are impressive, the rooms are a bit on the small side, but well appointed. Breakfast was very expensive and not worth the price.The Head Concierge was brilliant, the others were again average.If you are looking for a luxurious hotel, this is not for you. if you are looking for a good central point to explore Sydney, this is a great hotel to consider.

<Content>Great Location Four Points I stayed here for a work trip (included one weekend). The location is terrific (similar to what other raters have posted). The hotel is walking distance to many sightseeing attractions (as well as the business district). In Darling Harbor there are many restaurants all around the perimeter of the water.Note, right now they do not have internet access (high speed) in the rooms on floors 4 and below so if you want a room with in-room internet access (that you have to pay for either hourly or for the day) you will need to request a room on floors 5 and above. There is free wireless access from the lobby though. Concierge was very helpful--got us 4th row tickets to the opera with only 2 days' lead time. The bellhop at the hotel recommended not using the Airport Connector bus (there are other bus services that will service the Four Points to/from the airport). He said they were not very reliable and my friend had that experience--she bought a round-trip bus ticket when she first arrived in Sydney and took the bus to the Four Points hotel. She called to make her reservation to head back to the airport the day before her trip. They never showed up! Another alternative is to take the train from the airport to the Town Hall stop and then walk to the hotel--not bad with light luggage. The train was very quick (15 min). Overall, I would stay there again for leisure or business.

<Content>Perfect Location We stayed here for 7 nights on a room only basis in mid-December 2007, as part of a month visit to Australia.The staff were very helpful and friendly. We arrived at about 8am and as our room wasn't available yet, we had breakfast at one of the restaurants in the very nearby Darling Harbour. There is a walkway around the left and side of the hotel that gives you easy walking access across the main road to Darling Harbour.Our room was available from about 12 noon and given the flight times and time differences, we wanted to have a few hours sleep before hitting the streets of Sydney. Unfortunately, the hotel was carrying out fire alarm tests all day and so the intercom in our room was noisy with testing voices all afternoon and we were unable to sleep! Whilst we appreciate fire alarms need testing, the reception staff could have warned us that this exercise was being undertaken that day when we checked in.Although the room itself was small, we had a wonderful Darling Harbour view and the bed was extremely comfortable. We could not fault our room or the servicing of it.We didn't eat in the hotel at all, as there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. However, it did become difficult to find a table in numerous restaurants in Darling Harbour for dinner, as it seemed that every possible office in Sydney was holding their Christmas parties that week.We often walked down to Circular Quay, which took about 20 mins and we also sometimes took the ferries as well, which leave in front of the aquarium. Overall, we thought this hotel represented good value for money and was in an ideal location. We would recommend this hotel to others travellers and we would stay here again.

<Content>Good staff but otherwise only ok We had intended on staying 3 nights at the Sheraton but found it was a let down after all the other hotels we had booked on our 2 week vacation through Australia. We checked out and went home after only 1 night.The room was ok...only king bed..no doubles so all three of us (my teenage daughter and husband) had to share a king bed...since we are all skinny it wasn't a problem but hard to believe there were no doubles at all and a rollaway was extra.The breakfast buffet everyone seems to rave about couldn't compare to any buffet's I have had in the past all over the world. Even my teenager passed on it. The coffee was poor as well. The really good feature of the Sheraton was it's staff...the concierge's work really hard to answer everyone's questions and one guy in particular helped us alot to get the ferry to Manly.Also, the front desk was good and did not give me a hard time as a starwood preffered member to check out early.Don't stand in the starwood line though because they ignor it.I guess the main dissapointment was the gym or lack of it. It is probably our fault because all the other starwood hotels we booked had sauna's and steamrooms and some jacuzzi's. My husband was looking forward to relaxing since it was the end of our vacation but the gym was not at all what we expected.Actually we would have been happy with the Westin or the Sheraton on the Park and it's my fault for not looking at them closer and realizing the Sheraton 4 points is more of a group tourist busy place...not at all for relaxing.Do yourself a favor and book at one of those...the location is better too because we walked to circular quay all the time...the restraunts and shopping were so much better there and the transportation to Manly and Bondi are easier too.

<Content>Nice location and proximity to Darling Harbour For our 5 night stay, we have asked for a so called 鈥歋uperior Harbour View room鈥?(non-smoking, at a higher level). On checking, the initial room (3 beds, although asked for twin beds, and not cleaned, and the room at low level only, etc.) itself had practically no harbour view - only that of the Aquarium roof and main road below. We refused to take this room鈥?and finally (waiting patiently over three hours) we have got a nicer room and also situated at a higher level, as booked.The best asset of this hotel is its location, its proximity to Darling Harbour and nearby shopping malls, but the hotel is somewhat 'tired' in decor and outfit. The windows are sound-proof (mainly in view of the traffic of some importance), and the beds are good.The internet (wireless) at the lobby is properly working and free of charge (the broadband access in rooms is too expensive).Difficult to say if we would stay there again. Maybe we shall try next time another hotel (the Darling Harbour view is 'nice to have' but not a 'must'). From our understanding, there might be other options in the inner city (and less expensive ones).

<Content>Good but too expensive, esp with extras I've stayed at the Sydney Sheraton Four Points previously, and it's a good hotel, and this time was a good experience. BUT, they annoyed the heck out of us with their many fees. It costs money to use the office center, the breakfast was good but hugely expensive, and then the rooms aren't cheap either. The hotel is nicely located in Darling Harbour, but there's lots more of Sydney that's worth exploring beyond this area. If you want a great hotel that's spotless and easy, and close to tourist interests, this is a fantastic choice. Just be ready for lots of fees!

<Content>Hotel is only OK, but location is great! We recently spent four nights here and selected the Four Points because we had a corporate discount. With the discount we felt that the hotel was fair, but at regular rates we would have had issues. The Concierge and front desk areas are very nice and the hotel couldn't have a better location- you can walk almost anywhere that you'd like to go.Our room was the problem. Part of the issue could be that they were fully booked (which they said they were) and had to give us one of their poorer rooms. Our room had a nice city view, but was very cramped. The TV looked pretty old and the volume was inconsistent from channel to channel. The bathroom was our biggest issue. The fan didn't work and the tile around the tub showed signs of mildew and mold (both around the tub surround and where the tile met the ceiling. We complained, but the hotel desk said they couldn't do anyhting and would look at the whole room after we left. We also came back one day to find that the cleaning staff had changed the bed without putting full sheets back on. I liked the athletic facility and equipment, but it lacks a pool which I'm used to elsewhere. Overall I think that the experience was average. We would stay again in a pinch, but would hope for a bathroom in better condition.

<Content>expensive and inferior to other choices I am a SPG member, booked through them, and the best rate I got was $300+/night. I would rank this hotel a 4.5 Star, not a luxury hotel, and in some cases outlandish prices. The lobby restaurant has a $50/person buffet lunch, and takes advantage of few hotels within its vicinity.The line to check out in the morning took over 20 minutes of waiting before I opted to deposit a checkout envelope in a box by the elevator. Weeks later I had to ring them to gt a copy of it, as it was never sent to me.While the hotel is well kept, it is not the best location compared to less expensive, better quality hotels. Look elsewhere.

<Content>Lovely hotel Stayed in this hotel earlier this year and enjoyed our stay. This hotel is in a fantastic location near Darling Harbour which I would recommend to anyone staying in Sydney .....we also stayed in the Rocks later on in the month on the same trip  we thoroughly enjoyed Darling Harbour. The hotel itself has a businessy feel but the rooms are lovely .. very spacious, very comfortable bed and overall a nicely decorated room. Breakfast was also lovely though no time was wasted in starting to clear away the buffet when the time came. We stayed for almost a week and then came back to Sydney for a night and stayed again and this time were upgraded to a harbour view which was lovely (though I wouldnt necessarily pay a lot extra for this). To be upgraded a tad was nice though. Overall I would recommend this hotel  I would def recommend Darling Harbour as an area to stay. It is still in walking distance to the very heart of Sydney as well as having a great buzz all to itself! And there were some lovely restaurants there.

<Content>Not very good at this price. Stayed here one night as the rest of Sydney was full (yet again). I'd stayed here in the past when it actually was a Sheraton rather than a Starwoods, and it hasn't changed much at all.My booking was last minute - I paid top dollar at $AUD250. The check-in was very very efficient - but he seemed to take a while trying to find a better room for me. My room was on the first floor (room 163). All they had left was a twin room, with two single beds. The bed was ok comfort wise. And the view was street and main entrance - very bad. The carpet was well worn. The TV was old and on the small side, and the bathroom was on the older side - but adequate. Mt A big negative for business travellers - I saw no evidence of in-room broadband. It is covered by the Telstra CDB wireless broadband service though. This hotel is really full of tourists ... it's close to the tourist trap of darling harbour. It's really not geared up for business travellers.I had the buffet breakfast - $30+ for the full greasy. Yet another 2nd rate hotel where they won't let you sit down without deciding what you want first - full buffet or continental. Really, really, really annoying. How can I tell what I want before I can see what's on offer. Overall, I am sure that there are good rooms in this place - but my room wasn't one of them.

<Content>Great Service Stayed here in November 2007. Great Service by reception, concierge and restaurant staff. Nice room overlooking Darling Harbour. There is a walkway adjacent to the hotel, to Darling Harbour so you don't have to negotiate the roads, however, there are steps, so this would be difficult for disabled people or those with toddlers. We had a room on the 7th floor and it was very quiet, the bed was the most comfortable one that we stayed in on our tour of Australia and New Zealand. The breakfast is expensive but there is a good choice. However, there are restaurants in the harbour serving cheaper options. It is about a 20 minute walk to the bridge, but you can take a ferry for about $5 (aus).The restaurant is expensive, but there are plenty of other restaurants in the harbour to choose from and the hotel pub serves good cheap meals

<Content>Great Location Both myself and my wife stayed here for 2 nights in December 2006. Our room was a suite overlooking Darling Harbour. The room was clean, comfortable, very large and luxurious.We found the hotel employees to be very courteous and attentative.The big selling point of this hotel is it's close proximity to all sights in Sydney and the views over Darling Harbour.

<Content>Good but seriously crowded This hotel offers a rather sterile environment and it seems all charm has been lost on typical 3 star amenities.As a businessman who stays (or rather stayed) here weekly I have to say that the busloads of tourists that make up 80% of the hotel's visitors can make your stay a little frustrating. The restaurant/breakfast area can be full in seconds when another group lands, and the waiting times to catch an elevator can be daunting.High school kids kept me awake most part of the night as the plumbing is poorly isolated and you can hear people taking showers throughout the night. Hey, we were all young and all had those crazy school or holiday outings, but it just doesn't seem to glue well with people who need rest and tranquility.Asked about this, the receptionist told me that these groups are now the biggest customer base and that they should be expected to be there most of the year.Beds are excellent but the ongoing noise at night is not compensated by that.

<Content>Excellent Concierge service First I need to say this was booked thru spg.com using a cash and points offer. This was my first stop on my first trip outside the US.I had several email conversations with the hotel prior to arriving since we were arriving on 7 AM flight after 14 hours of flying I wanted us to have a room - so I had prebook the night before to guarantee we would have one okay no problem there.Check was easy, fast - we showered and headed downstairs to breakfast what - $40 for a breakfast buffet are you insane - obviously they are - Needless to say we skipped eating in the hotel after we had spent majot bucks on a morning meal.The room - The room was a good size. We had two twin beds, tv had some channels but not nearly enough we had a lot of news we were on vacation didn't need 3 sports channels and 4 news channels. The bath room had mold in the shower - that disappointed me. They have stuff to clean that - why couldn't Sheraton buy some?!Front desk after check in I used them a couple of more times - currency conversion - great - no fee and gave a very decent exchange rate. The next was to ask about access to the business center. They said I could get in anytime with my room key but need a card to get on line and I could buy the card in 30 or 60 min increments - but of course they were out and no one could get them for me. Huh? Out? The largest hotel in Australia can not connect a guest to the internet thru their own business center? Disappointing.Location: It is not in the smack center of everything but its within a 10 min walk, bus or ferry ride to Circular Quay where everything is centered. Darling Harbour is becoming more the entertainment are with lots of restaurants/cafes just behind teh hotel as well as the ferry.The concierge was the best I have ever dealt with - they helped me make an itinerary well ahead of my arrival and helped me make changes when I arrived. They always gave good advice.Several cafes are good just out of the hotels to the left two doors down is good as well as one just about 5 doors up King street.Overall its a good hotel to stay for price/location and the concierge.

<Content>Typical business hotel We stayed 4 nights at this hotel and weren't expecting that much and our expectations were confirmed. It is not a bad hotel by any means and it is perfect for the business traveller but we were on our honeymoon and it was good enough to lay our head down after a long day. The hotel staff are friendly enough and the room we were given was a harbour view room which was nice and clean. However, the location for visitors isn't great. It was about 15-20 min walk to the Sydney Opera house which wasn't a problem for us as we prefer to walk everywhere anyway but I can imagine those who want the sites on their doorstep wouldn't be too pleased. From our hotel we walked everywhere and not just to the 'typical' tourist spots including around north and east Sydney which was great. Sydney itself it an awesome place and I'd love to go back but would stay somewhere different. The hotel was fine for the business man/woman but not really for tourists.

<Content>Pretty Nice Good location on Darling Harbour, its restaurants and sights (e.g. aquarium, nature exhibition, maritime museum) with easy access to the central business district. Hotel is an older building, renovated and well maintained. Price is about what you would expect to pay for the area and class of hotel. Rooms on the harbourside have a nice view, and each room has an iron and ironing board, which is one less hassle.The rooms aren't massive, but they are adequate. Breakfast is pricey but nice and the coffee is excellent. Internet is not included in the hotel rate, so add another AUD 25 if you need it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I'd stay there again.

<Content>The Pefect Place In A Perfect Location I can not stress enough how this hotel is situated in the perfect location, in the heart of Darling Harbor. It is close to everything. I spent two months researching where to stay and after being in Sydney and seeing all the hotels that I considered, I am thrilled that I decided on the Four Points. Other considerations include the Four Seasons, Stamford  the Shangri La which are all beautiful places but I wanted location.The hotel itself is a bit old but still well maintained. Do get a room with a harbor view, EXCELLANT. I can say that this hotel gave excellant customer service, probably the only place in Sydney. We did have a car because we spent 4 days in the suburbs with friends  family, but when we went to the Four Points (the ideal location to see everything),the car spent another 4 days in the parking lot, unfortunately at $35 Aus a day so that wasn't great. We then went to the Blue Mountains after our 4 days there so we did not want to get rid of the car. (get a GPS system for your car, it's helps ALOT) Winter Time In Australia (we went in August) has the perfect weather, it really is not cold. (I live in the desert) Want to see the typical tourist places? get the combined packages, it's so much more affordable.Go to PADDY'S MARKET on the weekend, it's worth going there to buy gifts, it's so much more affordable there. I found everything that I bought around town,there at PADDY'S MARKET, MUCH CHEAPER Great hotel, ideal location, great customer service!!!

<Content>Location! Location! Location! This is a very nice hotel in a fantastic location. We booked a deluxe king harbour view and a twin harbour view. Rooms were very nice, good size, modern decor, comfortable beds, in room safe and nice bathroom. King room had a balcony. The King bed is a super king size and was very comfortable.This hotel is literally at the waters edge at Darling Harbour and is about 100metres max away from the water. The view from the room is fantastic. The harbour is a lovely sight.The service was very good, we used conceirge service, room service and we also had breakfast at the buffet. It was a bit pricy but the buffet was very nice.At Darling harbour you have the Aquarium and Wildllife World which were both worth going to. I was impressed with the Aquarium. The harbour is lined with a lot of restaurants and I would recommend Blue Fish (4 breakfast0, Blackbird, South Steyne floating restaurant, Dock Hotel.You can catch the Monorail into town or take a 10min max walk which takes you to Pitt Street which is the main shopping district.I would definetely stay at this hotel again. It is a very nice hotel and you are treated well by the staff who are also friendly.

<Content>great location The best thing about this hotel is the location: just a few steps from Darling Harbour.I arrived early in the morning from the UK and they had a room ready for me at around 9am.The room itself is fairly standard if not a bit dated. I had a non-smoking room, which was a former smoking room (it seem sto happen a lot in hotels these days), so the curtains had that awful smell.If you come from the airport, take the train to Town Hall, from there it's 10 minutes walk downhill to the hotel.Great place to stay if you can find a good rate, and perfect for Darling Harbour.

<Content>Loved it, shame there's no pool! Stayed in this hotel last night, as we were attending a concert in the city and didn't want to mission home. It was my first stay in a Sheraton hotel.As we have a few other stays booked at sheraton hotels later this year, i joined the starwood program. If the service we got was a result of that, then it is well worth the 5 min spent filling out the online form!I booked directly through the starwood site. The only request i made was, as it was my partner's birthday, for a room with a view on the higher floors. Not only did we get this, when we got to the room, there was a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates waiting for us. I thought that was a lovely touch.Room was very clean  bright. Bed was huge and fantastically comfortable. Bathroom was OK, a bit small but again, very clean (and ultimately, it does the job! Unless you're after a spa bath!). View was AMAZING. Straight out over Darling Harbour, across to the casino. We had the buffet breakfast included in our room rate,  it was far  away one of the better hotel buffets i've seen. Huge selection of juices, loads of different foods (the scrambled eggs were my personal favourite.... the blue vein cheese  crackers...so decadent at 0730 in the morning!)Staff were very polite  helpful. Over all a great stay. I have high hopes for our stays in other Sheraton hotels in the USA later this year!Only bad point - Such a shame that they don't have a spa or swimming pool. The hotel is a perfect location for rooftop heated pool!

<Content>great location Great location, right on Darling harbour, We had a harbour view room  upgraded our room to have a balcony, but found this to be a waste of money as the dual-carriage is directly below so you cant sit out due to the noise- dont waste your money. The room was ok, nothing to shout about, but didnt have any complaints. The bed was huge and very comfortable.Service at reception was good when checking-in/out. Didnt think much of the restaurant-rather small and difficult if you have a small child with buggy like we did. Only complaint was the lack of swimming pool. Ive never been to a 4/5 star hotel that didnt have a pool. The big advantage to this hotel is its location, it was great as you could get to pretty much any place from here without walking too far. the shops,restaurants, bars etc are right on the door step., and the view was great, so would recommend a harbour view room. Overall pretty good hotel.

<Content>Ideal base to explore Sydney The Four Points by Sheraton Darling Harbour has the ideal location for a first time or return visitor to Sydney. It is a few minutes on foot to the Sydney Aquarium, Sydney Wildlife World, Darling Harbour shops/restaurants/IMAX/museums, Cockle Bay Wharf, Chinatown  the CBD.BOOKINGWe made our reservation with the hotel direct and they were always efficient and professional in their correspondence. It was all in order on arrival. ARRIVAL/DEPATUREOn arriving at Sydney airport we took a taxi to the hotel. It was lunch time and cost around AUD$55 including a toll fee. On departing the hotel to return to the airport for our flight out it was early afternoon and the friendly taxi driver asked us if we wanted to take the fast or slow way, on asking the difference he said 10 minutes extra on the slow. Since we weren鈥檛 in a rush we took this option and it cost AUD$31.00. So if one isn鈥檛 in a rush on arriving/departing for the extra 5 minutes it ended up being it was a good AUD$20.00 saving. It is also possible to arrive by train direct from the airport terminal and no change of train is required. Ideal if there isn鈥檛 a lot of luggage. The train station to alight at is Town Hall and a short 5 minute walk to the hotel.RECEPTIONReception was well staffed and promptly checked us in. We had arrived a few hours before the hotel check in time of 1500 and were given key cards to our room early. Check out is at 1100 and it was extended by a few hours at no additional cost. On their website there is a fee of AUD $15 per hour up until 1800 advertised so it was very lucky we didn鈥檛 have this charged as we didn鈥檛 know about it until after we had asked to leave the room later for our flight timing. Nothing seemed to be a problem when asking reception and always professional. It was an impressive overall experience with the staff at this hotel.ROOMWe stayed in a Harbour View Room with a fantastic view on the Darling Harbour area with floor to ceiling glass. There was a good small mini bar selection and good basic range of amenities provided in the room. Additional ones were available at a call to housekeeping. The bathroom had a shower combined with the bathtub and it was a good standard but wouldn鈥檛 deem the bathroom we had luxurious. It was a very comfortable room, nice and clean. The main feature of the room is the view that made us very pleased with our choice.FACILITIESThere is a tour desk, business centre, concierge desk and a 24 hour gym. Unfortunately there was no swimming pool. This hotel can afford to not have a pool though as a drawcard due to the perfect location it offers. There is an overpass footbridge connecting to the hotel  then some stairs that serves as a short cut to arrive at the Cockle Bay Wharf/Darling Harbour area. There is a lobby bar, a pub and a restaurant however the immediate area also boasts some great places to go for a drink or have dinner. We only had breakfast at the hotel and dined in the area.AREAThe options are endless on things to do in the area of this hotel. And the wonderful thing for visitors is that a car isn鈥檛 required. Most can be done on foot or taxis/buses/monorails/ferries and trains as additional options. The ferry stop is a short walk from hotel that goes to the Circular Quay area (the Rocks, Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge). It is about a 15-20 minute walk down to this area or 3 stops away on the subway. The city centre with the Tower is just 5-10 minutes up towards the QVB/Pitt Street mall and the famous Darling Harbour  Cockle Bay Wharf area with a good selection of bars and restaurants.

<Content>A great place to stay in Sydney We were happy with our five day stay at the Four Points in Sydney. Our bed was very comfortable and we had a lovely view of Darling Harbour, which the hotel upgraded us to without request (probably due to membership in their Starwood program) The Conceirge was very helpful, esp when one of our bags were mis-delivered by the Super Shuttle to another passenger and immediately drove to pick it up herself. The location of the hotel was convenient to everything...and easy walk or ferry ride to everything. Avoid the breakfast buffet...very overpriced for quality of food. There's a cafe across the street that is much better for much less.

<Content>Great Location We stayed here for 4-5 nights in December. The hotel was completely full. When we arrived, they assigned us a room type that we had not booked. Unfortunately it was the only room available that night. However, after we spoke to the manager, they did move us first thing the next morning. The room was nice, very clean with a nice bathroom.The location of the hotel was great. We were right next to Darling Harbor and all of the restaurants there (King Street Wharf, I think). The hotel was also very close to the shopping mall (I forget the name, maybe it was very Victoria). Chinatown was nearby also, along with an IMAX theater. We mostly walked around Sydney and took cabs or the bus occasionally. It was about a twenty minute walk to the Sydney Harbor bridge and Opera House area. Even though the hotel is primarily business oriented, the concierge was very helpful with all of our touristy requests. In fact, the concierge service was excellent. They booked our Bridge Climb for us, gave us any number of options for our trip to the Blue Mountains, made wonderful suggestions for meals and made all of our reservations for everything, despite the fact that we noticed very few people asking them for touristy help. The people at the tour desk were very friendly and very honest with their recommendations and advice.Internet access at the hotel was very expensive, but the area convenience stores offer internet access within a few blocks of the hotel.

<Content>Okay but a few little things..... Our room was large with a huge huge bed. Furniture a bit shabby. Had a City View room unfortunately (our choice due to price!).Took ages to get our bags delivered to the room - and had to call and chase twice. I guess that's what you get with a hotel that is so large. It was an extremely busy hotel. Was really disappointed with the bathroom - really basic toiletries, small bath and rancid shower curtain! The worst thing was that the bath hadn't been cleaned properly and appeared to have specks of blood coloured substance on it and also some hairs in it. The toilet ran constantly once it was flushed and we had to have it fixed twice!I let the duty manager know of our little problems and he gave us a free breakfast in the hotel restaurant. That was delicious - can highly recommend it!Went to a lovely restaurant nearby called Eat City - also highly recommend this, the Tasting Menu with wine is superb.

<Content>Good location, OK hotel Stayed at the Sheraton for 2 nights (Feb 2-3) prior to a cruise. Overall we had a good experience. Our room was spacious and clean with nice amenities but at the far end of the second building. We had a city view, however wished we'd had a harbor view. The hotel staff was helpful with luggage, directions and recommendations for dinner.Darling Harbor (Aquarium and restaurants) are easy walking distance. The Quay and Rocks would depend more upon your enthusiasm, energy and fitness level. Sydney was surprisingly hilly.We arrived prior to our room being available, so the staff held our luggage and delivered it to the rooom when ready. We did not eat in the hotel.Overall a good if not great experience.

<Content>Definitely NOT Sheraton quality I am an SPG member and expect a certain quality from the hotel chain I most frequently use. This property is definitely not up to the usual Sheraton standard and is massively overpriced.I stayed for 3 nights in February but very nearly did not make it past the first. This was my first stay at this establishment.On arrival I was ignored by the concierge, even though he clearly saw me arrive and then struggle to load heavy suitcases from the taxi onto one of his trolleys that I personally had to retrieve. He didn't offer to assist until all the hard work was done and I was half way to reception.Reception then advised me that I had been upgraded due to high occupancy, but I was allocated exactly the room I had booked and overpaid for. The room was reasonably sized and appointed, but definitely not to Sheraton standards, and was well overdue for a refurbishment. The bathroom was tiny and poorly appointed. The room had just been cleaned and smelt like a chemical factory - it took more than an hour of airing before it was even habitable. Houskeeping advised that the same highly scented cleaning products were used in all rooms, so there would be no benefit in changing.At 10 minutes to 6pm I went to the restaurant to book a table for dinner later that evening, but I (and 2 other couples) were totally ignored by the staff until 6pm, when I presume the restaurant officially opens (however there were no signs to this effect). The Maitre d' came to the desk we were waiting at several times over the 10 minutes but didn't even have the decency to acknowledge those waiting until exactly 6pm.I ordered a Lamb dish from room service the next night, but was delivered what looked like, tasted like, and met the menu description of the beef steak dish. I contacted room service to query this and was forcefully assured that there was no question that I had been delivered the Lamb. The next night I placed exactly the same order and to my surprise (not), I received a totally different meal which looked and tasted like lamb.The above may seem like reasonably trivial matters, but they demonstrate a total disregard for the level of customer service one should expect from an establishment bearing the Sheraton name and charging the tariffs that they do.I will definitely cross this hotel off my Sydney stay list.

<Content>Good hotel and base for exploring Sydney We were pleased with this hotel. We had a Darling Harbour view and the room was comfortable and clean with good beds and bathroom. The location is great for seeing and getting around all of Sydney. We were there for 5 nights in November and found that quite often the pub attached to the hotel was not open the usual pub hours you would expect which was a shame, but probably a little out of season when we went. Staying here, You are right on top of Darling Harbour with all its bars, restaurants and sight seeing. You are within easy walking distance to the Rocks, Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Shopping, Sky Tower, etc. We bought Explorer tickets from the Quay which enabled us to a morning, afternoon and evening cruise, ferries, plus free travel on city and beach (red and blue) bus routes for three days. May seem alot to pay out in one hit (about 拢40 each), but in hindsight if you plan your days well this is definitely the best way to see as much of Sydney as you can. There is a bus stop at the bottom of the steps at the back the hotel. To be honest, we didn't spend an awful amount of time in the hotel, but it was a very nice hotel to come back to you after a day or night out. The concierge were always polite and very helpful.

<Content>Pretty Good for a 4 Star Hotel Quite impressed for a 4 Star Hotel. The rooms are modern, clean and the bed is very very comfortable. You can tell it is not 5 star in the bathroom because the bath and shower are pretty basic. Harbour view is fantastic. All staff were professional and efficient. Didn't try the hotel restaurants or bar because they looked pretty tacky. Many better places to try outside.

<Content>great location Great location. We booked a Darling Harbour view room and were not disappointed. The view was wonderful. The room was nicely decorated. It was a lot smaller than we had expected and the noise from adjoining room showers and the hall noise was louder than we have experienced in good hotels. The staff were professional...but not friendly. However, we would stay there again.

<Content>Not my favorite Sheraton Usually Starwood is my favorite chain, but this Sheraton is a dud. Hotel staff were average... we had to ask several times for housekeeping to put a sheet on the bed (for some reason, all they kept putting on was a comforter and it wasn't always clean, and we had to call four times for our mini-bar to be cleared out so we could use the fridge. The concierges were sometimes ok, but many times they kept telling us to ask one of the others that would be on site the next day (why hire concierges that don't know where things are?) and there was on that was less than competant. (Very disappointing.) The location was good... near Darling Harbor, so that was nice. The room was clean-ish, but I just didn't get the feeling that it was well-kept. If you stay here, stay on the Harbor side, the view is worth it.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location This hotel was great. The room was modern, clean, and had a great view. Spend the extra few dollars to get the harbour view...it is worth it. The location is great for walking around Darling Harbour and is only a 15 minute walk to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House! Would definitely stay here again.

The room we had was lovely with a balcony overlooking Darling Harbour. I would recommend this hotel providing you get a harbour view.

<Content>Four points Stayed here for 5 Nights, Found the price of food was a bit high and don't use the mimi unless u have a credit card!. Nothing against the hotel great location right in Darling Harbour easy access to all sydney, either by ferry or by bus. Great pubs and food outlets near by if u want to eat out. We found the best priced food was in Star City casino across the brigde, all u do is become a member and get a great discount on food well worth doing even if u don't gamble.

<Content>good hotel. great location! hate to be predictable ...but this is in a great location. staff are friendly and efficient although check out queues were a bit long (mostly because of a troublesome man who had no working credit card and yet still assumed he could move on regardless!)a good base to explore this city..my wife and i stayed there as part of a wedding anniversary trip....the porters etc were so nice and we were up graded to a suite which was absolutely beautiful. we were also provided with a botlle of bubbly and chocs.and a card! beautiful touches!id have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for visitors....only drawback ,if it is one, is that the front bar is quite quiet.....but who cares...uve the whole of sydney to explore!we spent 6 nites there...and while that may have been slightly too long for a stay in sydney in our opinion it is certainly a thumps up for this hotel

<Content>Good location I stayed at this hotel in October,2006 with my wife and our parents to have a marriage ceremony and honeymoon. Location is good. This hotel is nearby Daring Harbor and Sydney aquarium. And you can walk to Sydney Tower. But if you want to go to Opera house or Harbor biridge, you have to use taxi or bus.Our room was on the first floor. At first,I was disappointed because our room wasn't on upper floor. But the view from the room was decent beautiful in the night. We can look over the opposite shore and there were some glittering hotels. Neons were sparkling.We had a marriage ceremony in Sydney.After finishing the ceremony,we returned to the hotel still wearing wedding clothes. Some staffs congratulated us. We had a good feeling. Generally,this hotel is good hotel. Staffs were very polite and friendly. The Hotel itself is not so big.But room and bed are clean and large. But maybe little expensive,perhaps.

<Content>Fancy hotel with superb location and staff We were on honeymoon and stayed in the four points for 4 nights at the end of August. Before we arrrived we realised that our travel agent had booked us a city room so when we got to the hotel we asked about an upgrade. It cost us $30 extra per night for a harbour view. We decided to go for it.The room was immaculate, with a HUGE bed (I didn't think beds came in that size!) lots of cosy cushions, a massive TV, fridge, mini bar, safe, hairdryer, not to mention a fantastic view of Darling Harbour.The maids service was second to none, the room was always well made up. The check in staff were very helpful as were the consierge staff. One member of staff who sticks in my mind as going the extra mile was Tony (he was on the front door). We wanted to go to Bondi Beach and were recommended to take a taxi, however Tony asked if we were feeling adventurous and wanted to save some money. Why not. He told us to get the tube, then change at Bondi Junction and get the public bus to the beach, he even told us how much the fares would be and what platforms the tubes were on. The hotel catters for the business world and there were lots of suits about and to be honest sometimes we did feel out of place being the tourist, but we were not treated any differently by the hotel staff.The restaurant prices are steep, but there are loads of nice places to eat at Darling Harbour or if you like steak and ribs there is a Tony Romas a few doors down.The hotel is only about 4 blocks from the Queen Victoria buildings which have the most fabulous array of shops and boutiques (the tube station is also here too). The first few days in Sydney we got on the Ferry boats to take us to cirular quay, but we realised it wasn't that far to walf.All in all its a great hotel. The staff are great, the hotel is clean and when we were checking out we didn't have to pay our suppliment for a harbour view as they upgraded us for free for being on honeymoon.

<Content>Loved It! --Orange County, CA, USA We booked our vacation to Australia (Sydney  Melbourne) through Qantas Vacations. We chose this hotel in Sydney because we wanted to be close enough to the city center but also wanted to be right by the harbour. We stayed at the hotel for a week in July.Our flight from Los Angeles arrived early in the morning and we were at the hotel by 8am. They couldn't check us in right away because our room wasn't ready yet so they told us it will be ready at 10am. No problem, we just left our luggage there and we walked down the street and got breakfast at this little deli nearby with reasonable prices for breakfast and sandwiches rather than getting breakfast at the Corn Exchange restaurant at the hotel. After breakfast, we went back to the hotel and lounged around by one of the many sitting areas around the lobby of the hotel and then we checked in at 10am as promised.The room was a good size room and we had two double beds and a sofa bed. The room had plenty of space for 3 people to move around even with 6 luggage laying around the room. The room was nicely equipped with a mini bar, tv, coffee maker, safe, closet, iron, desk, etc. The bathroom was big and had all the amenities we needed (hair dryers, toilletries, international plugs, etc.). The room was clean and housekeeping always kept our room tidy and in order by the time we get back to our hotel later in the day.The view from our room was fantastic! We had a view of the harbor and the bridge, and right across the Maritime Museum. We later realized we can actually also see the sea lion house in the Sydney Acquarium from our hotel room. The room was quiet, we didn't hear noise from our neighbors.The people at the reception area were so friendly and accommodating. The people at the concierge were also very friendly, accommodating and were just so helpful in getting us the information we needed and also some discounts to places, tours, etc. that we weren't aware of.The hotel is so close to the Victoria shopping center, you can just walk up the hill and get there. We would just walk around the corner to get to the harbor and catch a ferry going to The Rocks and the Sydney Opera House. If you're in a group of 3 or 4 people, I suggest to take a cab to get to the Rocks area or even the Sydney Bridge area since taking the ferry (+ walk) to get to that area didn't really save much money, sometimes it actually cost more to pay for single tickets to take the ferry. Downtown is not far at all, even taking a cab isn't as heavy on the wallet either. But there is plenty of good public transport to get you around wherever you need to be (ferry, bus, tram). The tram is just up the hill from the hotel and you can catch that to get you to places as well.There's a little store in front of the hotel where you can get some goodies and snacks and bring them back to your hotel and use the mini fridge to store soda, water, etc. and should help save money from having to use the mini-bar stuff.All in all, we really loved our stay at this hotel and we'd go back and stay there again.My friends and I are quite picky with hotels so we were quite pleased with Four Points Sheraton's location, room, and the overall service of the hotel. Liked: Room, Staff, LocationDisliked: Food prices at the hotel restaurant can be steep (but so are most restaurants at any hotel for that matter)Tips: Eat breakfast at a deli nearby the hotel, cheaper! Also, take a trip to Manly Beach if you have time, quite picturesque and the view from the ride on the ferry on the way there is pretty.

<Content>Nice hotel - great view - We had a Harbour View room wich is the best place to be in that hotel. The room was not very clean when we arrived and I went to the reception to complaint. When we returned from our walk outside, the room had been cleaned and the hotel had put a good bottle of wine on ice in the room to excuse themselves for the situation. It was nice and not expected. Breakfeast buffet is expansive but really good. Lot of business customers and japanse tourists in the hotel. Room are not silent proof and you can hear next room shower from yours. Overall I recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed here as part of our honeymoon. We were upgraded to a harbour view room which is have excellent views of darling harbour (the city view rooms seem to look directly onto an office block across the street)The room was fairly large with TV, mini bar, safe, the best blackout curtains in the world! We were room only so didn鈥檛 really use the facilities except the first night where we had some food and a few beers at the attached Dundee Arms Pub. Pretty good beer and better than the usual hotel Pub effortsThe Hotel is directly behind the Aquarium and Darling Harbour. Plenty of bars and restaurants here to have breakfast and dinner. On the far side of the Aquarium there is a ferry stop that takes you to the city centre. However, ferries here are not that frequent and stop early, rubbish if you want a night out in the city. You can walk this in 20 mins. Despite some guides, this is a aus$40 taxi ride to the airport.I thought this was a pretty good hotel if slightly out of the main city areas but I would probably stay here again.

<Content>Four Points, Average Points Being close to the city center, the main clientele is business people although when I was here (19 Sept. 2006) there was big Japanese wedding.The recpetionist has a smile when you check in but I have a feeling that they are overworked; every time I passed by the area, there was always a line at recpetion. The bell service is good.Room is just large enough to enjoy it for reading with a beautiful view of the harbor. The rooms are noisy as the walls are not solid enough to block out the noise from your neighbor next door or several doors down. The bathroom is adequate with a tub and a shower.The lobby and the surrounding areas have nice comfortable chairs to use while you browse the internet wirelessly.The coffee shop at the lobby is always busy with people lining up for breakfast. The wait isn't too bad, though. At other times, there is almost always a table readily available.

<Content>Not a hotel for leisure clients We checked into the hotel at 18.30 on a week night (this August - stayed two nights) and were told that our room was not ready yet (check in time at the hotel is 14.00). We got given some coupons for a drink at the bar and were given a room at 19.30. We had requested and paid a Harbour view (the receptionist was actually on the verge of giving me a city view but I think she noticed I was extremely angry at the time and somehow found one harbour view available). Nice views and a good sized room and an extremely comfortable bed...It has a very corporate look to the whole hotel. We had opted out of breakfast which was a good decision in the end as the queues for the buffet were outrageous! Plenty of breakfast places nearby. We thought the hotel was mainly for corporate clients and did not feel extremely welcoming for leisure guests. I would not recomend this hotel for tourists wanting to spend a few days in Sydney as it has not got a relaxed feel to the hotel and one can get better 4* hotels for the price (eg. Radisson Plaza Sydney, great hotel!).

<Content>Big bed, tiny room in this soul-less, ex Japanese owned hotel View from the room was great though.Room was noisy. Ok if you are a heavy sleeper, don't mind hearing the people next door take a shower, run a bath or listen to guests in the corridor etc. I suppose..Not very close to major public transport - Ok if you don't mind walking, solely using the limited  expensive, touristy monorail or have little luggage or like using taxis. But then, it IS Darling harbour after all!Staff were, how can I put it, without wanting to use an insulting word or being impolite? The term 'surly', feels apt.Despite pre-paying 100% of the non-refundable rate including ALL taxes on the hotel's own website, months before arriving, they tried to sting me when I checked out. I was told that they had made a 'mistake' on the hotel rate  I needed to pay the difference... So be careful! Apparently, according to the receptionist I spoke to, it happens a lot. What seems like a good rate may not be if the hotel receptionists try and wangle more money out of you just as you are leaving. No mention was made of course when I checked-in of their 'mistake'. After a discussion with a manager, I was eventually advised that I would not have to pay for THEIR mistake. The breakfast room (which is actually in the lobby of the hotel) was chaotic with really long queues  over-priced. Better choice  more relaxing to eat at a nearby cafe. So, this was my first ( last) stay at a Four Points Hotel. Maybe I was just unlucky, but I wouldn't stay there again. There are plenty of other places to stay!

<Content>Classy with a great location My girlfriend and I stayed at the Four Points July 13-15, 2006 because she had points eligible for a free stay and we just payed for the second day. The hotel was very classy from the moment we stepped onto the property. Our flight from san francisco arrived in sydney around 7:30 am and they were able to check us in right away (normal check in time is in the afternoon). A nice long shower after a 15 hour flight was priceless. We had a double queen and our view was city side but we didn't really miss the harbor view because we were only in our rooms for sleeping and showering. The view only showed the parking garage across the street and a glimpse of Sydney Tower. The hotel is steps away from Darling Harbor which has many bars and restaurants. It is also on the west side of the central business district, well within walking distance of the botanical gardens, opera house, The Rocks, Chinatown, and Darling Harbor. The hotel has a restaurant on the ground floor which looked very nice. Prices were just that, pricey. Buffet lunch was over $30 AUD ($25) per person and dinner was $50 plus a la carte per person. With the amount of restaurants around, you had a much better deal walking around and finding a cuisine that fit you and your pocketbook better. During our 2 week trip, we were in Sydney on two different occasions with the first staying here at the Four Points. The second hotel we stayed at was the Metro Hotel on Pitt (300 Pitt Street). With half the price and only 2 blocks away, I thought the Metro was a better hotel pick in my opinion (read my review of that hotel). Overall, the Four Points is a very fine hotel. Very clean, quiet, and classy amenities and staff. You will not be disappointed. But with the higher price tag, I would choose the Metro Hotel on Pitt based on value.

<Content>Nice stay We stayed at the Four Points on a Saturday night. The room was nice, the view was great, staff very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast the next morning was lovely. The hotel is in a great position only a short walk to King Street wharf and the Aquarium. The only complaint was the sounds coming from the pipes after we got back to our room around midnight. We called the front desk and they came up to our room immediately. They thought it may be next door's shower and couldn't do anything about it. The noise eventually stopped after about 45 minutes.

<Content>Great location, great view I just got back from Sydney a week and Port Douglas . We went to watch our boys in the Saratoga High School Band perform in the Sydney Opera house. It was awesome.The Sheraton is in a great location that is walking distance to the Darling Harbor area. We were really fortunate since I booked the cheapest price through the Sheraton web site which is a city view and twin beds but we got upgraded to a harbor view and a king bed. The view was awesome!! Since it was the winter, maybe it is off season? I joined the free perferred guest program and maybe that helped?FYI, Port Douglas is the place to stay...forget about Cairnes.

<Content>Perfect Location Upon arriving we thought that this was just another 4* chain hotel. Nice enough rooms in a nice enough hotel. The location however was perfect. Right next to Darling Harbour with all of the restaurants and bars. Great location for sightseeing and not too far from the bridge.The thing that stands this hotel apart from just another hotel is the service.Upon arrival we had chilled champagne and chocolates waiting for us (it was our honeymoon). This was a great way to unwind after our transfer flight.The next morning we went to concierge to find out information about trips. I don't think we have ever met a more knowledgable concierge in all of our travels. Very helpful and friendly and made you feel really welcome. They booked all of our trips for us.  They also found out that we were on our honeymoon and were more than sweet about it. Due to the fact that they had booked our trips they knew all of our comings and goings - so they arranged that on the night we got back from our bridgeclimb (do this at night it is amazing!) to have a selection of desserts sent up to the room waiting for us. Along with this a card signed by all of the concierge staff wishing us a wonderful trip and a happy marriage.It made it a memorable stay.

<Content>Not bad but better elsewhere for similar $$ I spent 2 nites in a city view twin bedded room. The room was clean and promptly serviced each day. The staff were extremely helpful However, the down side was that the beds were a standard single and not king singles that you find in other 4 to 5 star hotels. the beds were not comfortable (pillows were plentiful and fine). Also, the rooms were a bit on the small size. I have always previously stayed at the Grace Hotel not far away and will probably go back to the grace next time.

<Content>High quality hotel in business district Stayed here for a week on business. Good quality hotel central to the business district and on the edge of Darlng Harbour with plenty of restaurants and bars.Ask for a harbour view (and insist on it being free - as they will concede eventually) as the view is superb.Good rates including breakfast (which is excellent). Would recommend this to anyone.Location is about 2 streets from the main tourist areas and a 20 minute walk from the old town.

<Content>GREAT We arrived at about 8 in the morning (after a 24hr flight from the UK) and were allowed to book-in strait away. This meant, after a long hot shower, we had a complete whole day in Sydney at the beginning of our holiday.The hotel is in a good position. Not for the views but for the fact that you are relativelly close to all that Sydney has to offer.The APT tour was going on when we visited and the players staying here included Serena Williams.All-in-all a very clean, comfortable, modern and reasonable priced hotel.We would stay here again.

<Content>Good location A little late in writing this but friends and I stayed at this hotel for three days in December and thought it was great. Our room was small, but the location made up for it. Being right on the harbor was nice, but it was also an easy walk to most sights and had public transport very near by. If you can find a deal, we thought this was a great option.

<Content>Excellent Deal for the Money We normally do not favour the Four Points across the world...but this hotel was great. We chose this hotel because it was a Starwood Property and it was located across the pedestrian bridge from my business meeting at the Novotel (twice the price)..but it was a great deal for the money. We had a room overlooking the Darling Harbour...and the view was great. Because the hotel is located on the city side...it makes it easy to walk everywhere. There are a lot of choices in sydney...but this is an excellent find. We ended up booking on Last Minute and got a room at 1/2 price of any hotel in the area.Not sure if it's new...but the room and hotel looked like it had just been refurbished. We even liked the little Armour Pub located on the premises.They had a walkway which went right onto the main hub of the Darling Harbour...and it was right on the pedestrian bridge for the other side of the harbour...

<Content>This is not a Tourist Hotel We had been travelling around Australasia for 23 days including 12 days on a cruise ship.Sydney was our last ( 4 night) stopover before heading home to UK and we had been booked into the Four Points.The location is quite good being close to the city centre and Darling Harbour (via a bridge built across the very busy highways that pass close to the hotel and down five flights of steps onto the quayside)For a business traveller, the rooms are very well equiped - having a full size office desk with a drawer equipped for hanging files plus drawers for other office requirements - but not clothing items. There was also a very nice leather high-back chairThe room also had another superb piece of furniture - half of which was occupied by a large fridge. The rest of the cabinet housed fitted drawers containing a set of glassware with wine and whisky glasses, ice bucket etc. and finaly a tray with equipment to produce hot drinks - tea and coffe etc.There was a small hanging wardrobe which was partially occupied by an ironing board and iron and a safe.Others in our group, confirmed that their rooms were similarly equippedOur problem - in common with most people travelling for a month, live out of two large hard shell suitcases. In these rooms - it was just impossible open suitcases except by doing so on the bed -or by moving the large chair into the passage leading to the door.Verdict on hotel - Good for business people for short stay's - but DEFINATELY NOT for people touring with large suitcases.Beverage and Food prices were about 50% higher than we had been paying in the other 4 and 5 star hotels we had used in Australia and NZ

<Content>Superb Concierge My wife and myself stayed at the 4 Points for 7 nights between the 16th of April and the 23rd of April, 2006. Found the hotel excellent in every way. Great location, great service and good room. No complaints, at all. In particular, I'd like to praise the Concierge, Mr. Jeff Place, who was just fantastic. He went out of his way to help us relax and gave us excellent advise on where to go and what to do. Though the entire Concierge staff was very helpful, Jeff was just outstanding. I predict that this guy is going to go places ;-) (no pun intended). We would definitely stay at the 4 Points again.

<Content>fantastic hotel The Four Points was just gorgeous. We were able to check in several hours early with no hassles at all. the concierge services were fantastic and went out of their way to ensure we had everything that we needed. the room was clean with great decor and the bed was devine... huge kings size which was like sleeping on a cloud. Eating and drinking at the hotel was a little pricey but think the same could be said of almost any sydney hotel. The location was beyond superb, with its own walkway onto the harbour. Could not have been happier with my choice, especially once I had looked around the harbour and compared this hotel to the others in the area.

<Content>Location great, hotel poor Stayed 3 nights, found hotel to be expensive, tattly to tired, breakfast to be avoided - dreadful and VERY expensive - go to starbucks - or Subway on the harbour a 2 minute walk - and have a better breakfast with a better view and at 20% of the cost!Found the room City view onto noisy narrow street - no view - very dark - but size ok - bathroom looked very tired and needed updating.Might consider again for location if deal was right.

<Content>Nice Hotel but Not Great Hotel I did alot of research in finding a hotel to stay at since I do our company's travel and accommodation bookings.We were tossing up between 4 Points, Intercontinental and Shangri La and chose 4 Points because of the balcony, locality and reviews from Trip Advisor.The hotel and staff were nice enough but we were disappointed with our suite, which was a Cockle Bay suite with a balcony. As there were 3 of us, one utlised the sofa bed which was very small. The view was lovely but since we stayed at Quay West last time, much preferred the view of the Opera House. Darling Harbour is nice  esp if you have kids but to compare with Circular Quay, would prefer to stay there. We paid more for the suite at 4 Points than for a 2 bedroom at Quay West last year but got an amazing view and huge suite at Q.W. Also the sliding door at 4 Points was so noisy and hard to pull and you didnt have any chairs to be able to sit outside.We were also disappointed as I thought there would have been a nice late night bar with a view as hotels such as Shangri La and Intercontinental had. Although we have a child it was a child free weekend so we were hoping to live it up a bit.I also agree with another review on the shower facilities. For what you pay, rooms need a refurbishment.All in all, we were disappointed but for some I know its a great hotel and understand, just depends on what you like and prefer.

<Content>only if you like russian roulette! Having just returned from my third stay at the four points, I feel I should shed some light on this hotel. My first stay was appauling, went back to my room one night in tears after being treated rudely by the restaurant staff. Second stay was excellent, treated like a queen (possibly some notes were made after my previous encounter)..and was happy to book again this year. It seems its 50/50 as to the service you get. My current stay was nothing short of 1 star. I payed a premium rate for a suite as a preferred guest. After being given a room on the second floor with unacceptable street noise, when I requested a change, I was rudely told by staff no chance. I then discovered that people who payed a substantially lower rate over the internet last minute sites were given better rooms and services, including complementary champagne..none for those who are willing to pay it seems! The breakfast is appauling, greasy, and of a low food standard,all frozen and prepackaged food, plus, you are packed in like sardines if you arive after 9am! The bathroom was mouldy and the bed linen ripped and torn. No table was supplied in the room, making working or eating n the room very difficult!! I agree that the location is good, but for what they claim, you should expect a better level of standard service. If you are planning to stay, don't book a premium room, and book over a last minute site like wotif, much better rates and deals are offered, and don't pay extra for buffet breakfast! For much the same price, you could stay at the parent property, sheraton on the park, which, despite some reviews i've read, is far, far superior!!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Since we had paid for our room in advance (a cityside standard room), on arrival we were offered a fantastic preferential rate and upgraded to a deluxe room with a harbour view and balcony, sofa etc on the 10th floor.Shortly after we arrived in our room we were given a complementary bottle of champagne and a box of Lindt chocolates which was marvellous. The room was great, spotlessly clean with a very comfortable super king size bed. Not a massive bathroom but decent size, nice decor, large mirrors and good shower. The air conditioning was also good and not noisy as in some other hotels we've stayed in. A free copy of the Sydney Times was also delivered and left outside our room door each morning.Location is great for Darling Harbour (the Sydney Aquarium, National Maritime and Powerhouse museums are based here) which is about 100m away (the hotel has its own access walkway) and is also close to Chinatown and the CBD.There are no buses or trains which go directly past the hotel but we didn't mind walking and walked everywhere. The area felt safe even at 4am. Circular Quay (where the Opera House and most ferries go from) is around a 20 minute walk away (you can get a ferry from Darling Harbour to Circular Quay which takes 5 minutes but they don't run very often). The closest train station would probably be Town Hall which is around a 5-10 minute walk away, Central Station (for the Blue Mountains) was around a 15 minute walk away. The monorail is also very close.I agree that Darling Harbour isn't the best view in comparison to the Opera House but it was wonderful for the price we paid.The hotel has a gym overlooking the harbour (which we didn't use) and a business centre ($10 per hour). We did not eat or drink at the hotel so we couldn't comment on the hotel food. However we had no problem finding plenty of quality restaurants and bars in Darling Harbour and the nearby area. The hotel is busy and is obviously used frequently for business conferences but we did not experience any noise problems at all. All the staff we came into contact with were always friendly and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Brilliant Standard  Lovely - would recommed without hesitation. We arrived early morning having flown 21 hours from the UK and although it was too early to check in we were offered access to a shower to freshen up. The room was a deluxe harbour view with balcony and it was spacious, well designed and equipped and had fabulous views over Darling Harbour and was within a 25 minute walk of The Rocks and Opera House - fantastic!

<Content>About right for this price I had 2 rooms here. One was a harbour view room, which contrary to most reviews, did NOT have a great view of darling harbour. It was a more expensive rate, but being only on the 2nd floor, it was less than spectacular to look at a small section of the harbour across a major arterial road leading into Sydney city.The other room was on the top floor and faced the office precinct. This was actually a more intersting view than the previous room.The reason for changing rooms was that broadband is only offered on levels 4+ and that was a feature i required. Broadband was cheaper here then most equivalent hotels in the area at AU$25/day.V.close to a lot of decent restaurants. Good for business travellers.

<Content>Great View - Excellent Location Upgraded to 10th Floor on arrival - superb view over Darling Harbour (which is not huge, but easily big enough). I'm no expert on Sydney but this just might be the very best location in town for a short 3/4 day stay - lots of Bars and Restaurants and voluntary plastic damage. Harbour front is about a 200 yard walk away. Right near MonoRail Station (no noise). Easy short walk over pedestrian bridge to other side of harbour for more Bars, Restaurants and Shops. 15 minute walk to get to Circular Quay, Opera House and that Bridge they never paid for. Circular Quay is where a lot of main harbour tours leave from.If you decide to do the Captain Cook Fine Dining Evening Cruise (bit pricey, but what the heck - lots of Brownie Points) get a window table. Instead of going all the way down to Circular Quay you can join and leave the boat at No 1 Berth at King Street Wharf (about 400 yards from Hotel)There's and old Pub just outside the hotel - from the outside and the photo's it looks great, was going to have a bite and a beer there, but once inside looked jaded and a bit seedy.Overall 4 Pts is a good hotel with helpful staff.

<Content>give the over priced breakfast a miss and head to..... I booked this hotel over the internet prior to a stay. Our room was on the 7th floor with an excellent view over Darling Harbour, however the balcony was dirty so we did not venture out. Give the breakfast a miss and walk round into Market St. to LIME cafe about 50 yds up from hotel, wonderful food, great service and you pay about half the price of the hotel.This hotel was the most over priced we stayed in during our six week stay however the bed was wonderful just what you are looking for after a 14 hour flight.

<Content>Had a wonderful time We recently stayed at 4 points by Sheraton on Darling Harbor. It was outstanding. We were upgraded to King bed and beautiful harbor view. The staff couldn't have been nicer. We came back through Sydney and stayed again on Australia Day. We did not get an upgrade this time but still had an excellent room without the view. The location is convenient to many nice restaurants and local attractions. It worked for us.

Room was very comfortable and the king sized bed a joy to get into especially after our stop over from Singapore. We slept 13 hour solid as the soundproofing was also extremely good. all the staff were very helpful and the doormaneeven managed to hail a taxi for us on New Years Eve to get down to the Rocks. Would definetely stay again.

<Content>Superb Hotel on Darling Harbour We stayed at this great hotel for 3 nights in mid December 2005. This was our last of 3 sections of our holiday in Sydney, having stayed at the Park Hyatt and the Sebel Pier One earlier (see separate reviews!).Of all 3 hotels we stayed in, we were the most satisifed with this hotel. It's standards were superb, location perfect and service excellent. The entrance is road side, rather than harbour side, and so you don't appreciate where you are until you're inside your room, or walk to Darling Harbour, and then you see how great the location is.Value for moneyWe stayed in a Maritime Studio (which is essentially a deluxe room) on the 15th Floor (the very top floor) on which we got a great deal through Hotel Club.com For comparison, the 3 nights here cost us 拢450 BB, compared to 拢1050 for 3 nights in a Deluxe Opera View room at the Park Hyatt. Hence why overall (inc value for money) this is a better hotel.The roomWe had a Maritime Studio, and whilst I'm not sure of the full range, it seemed equivalent to a Deluxe room. At some other hotels, I've had rooms of this grade described as junior suites on account of the room features/balcony.The room was large, with a fanstastic full length wrap round balcony (unique to the maritime studios - other rooms have a smaller balcony, and some just a window), and all glass to the interior - so there were excellent night views to be had across the harbour.The bed was a huge King size bed, and very comfy. There was a separate dressing area and a large bathroom, well supplied with good toiletries etc. The mini bar was well stocked and (compared to many hotels) more moderately priced - we even had a few beers from it.LocationIf you want the opera house side, you don't want to be at Darling Harbour. DH is a more active and cosmopoitan side of Sydney, even though its not that far away across town. It has a younger feel, and there is plenty going on well into the night.Within easy reach of the hotel is the Main Area of Darling Harbour, with its many restaurants and attractions, such as the Aquarium and the Maritime Museum. A little farther is the entertainment complex/casino hotel, Star City, which is worth a look if you like that scene. The hotel itself has a few small shops built in as well as being pretty much next to a Monorail Station, which lets you ride around DH in a big loop that also takes in Paddy's Market (a large indoor market, which seems to be dominated by Chinese stall holders!), China town, and some of Sydney's central shopping area. At $3 a trip, its a good deal, though seating is hard to come by when busy.MealsWe only had breakfast, but its the usual buffet type and is pretty good. The hotel must cater for a large Japanese clintele as well, as the also serve Miso soup and other oddities for breakfast if you want to try them !The bar is very friendly and professional, always ready with a Tooheys New after a long walk round town.ServiceWe found all services to be superb, though we heard some argument going on with a reservation mix up as we were checking in, so maybe we were lucky? However, the hotel does have a very helpful feel, and the concierge was excellent in helpinmg us make arrangements for airport transfers, booking the Sydney Obsevratory night trip, and even a hire car (which involved a very modest premium for the hotel of something like AUD10).AlternativesThere are several hotels in Darling Harbour, though the larger ones seem to be the other side of DH, taking them just a little further away from the centre of Sydney. The other hotels we've stayed at are the Park Hyatt (superb, but pricey), the Sebel Pier One (my opinion - don't bother unless all you want to do is sleep in the room to recover jet lag), and the Quay Grand Suites (an excellent, reasonably priced, all suite hotel next to Circular Quay, if you want to be a the heart of the Quay).Have a great timeMichael

<Content>Fantastic - top notch hotel Amazing hotel located above Darling Harbor (there are many amazing hotels in Syndey, it depends on the location that is important to you). We loved the Four Points, we had a view of the harbour lights in the evening. We had booked the hotel on Priceline but we were treated by the concierge as if we had payed full price - something that I have not found to be the case in other four/five star hotels. Not only was the room outstanding and the view incredible, we were given excellent hotel and sightseeing recommendations. The staff went out of their way to be pleasant and accomodating. Truly a pleasure at the end of an amazing trip to Australia.

<Content>Great Location We have just stayed at this hotel and although it is a large hotel used by business people and tourists, we were treated very well by the reception staff. We did not use any of the other facilities in the hotel but our room, which had a harbour view was excellent. The air conditioning was a good send after a long day walking around in the heat and the room was a lovely size and no problems at all to report. Now believe me guys, if there is something to moan about, my hubby will normally find it! The location is fab, just come out of the hotel, turn right and use the stairs at the side of the hotel to get to Darling Harbour. Or come out of the hotel onto the road, turn right onto Market Street and this leads up to the roads which take you to the train station, Tower, shopping, restaurants etc. We managed to walk to the train station from the hotel - took us about 25mins, Paddys Market and just about everywhere. We only used the City hop on hop off buses on the first day and didnt have to use the buses, monorail at all. Do use the train for your Blue Mountain trip, it takes two hours and a ticket for the train and explorer bus is only $37.00 each. If you want more information from our visit, I will be writing a report on the Sydney Forum shortly - my user name is cantwaittobethere and I will give loads of helpful tips on there for all you lucky ones that are going out there soon.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at Four Points By Sheraton for the first four nights of our stay in Australia. We could not have asked for a better positioned hotel. Close to the City Centre shopping our deluxe room was spacious and clean and we had a wonderful outlook right over Darling Harbour.There is a busy road directly in front/below the hotel but we did not hear any traffic unless we opened the windows and went onto the balcony to look at the harbour lights in the evening - it was not a problem. Have to mention the bed as it was huge and so comfortable the best we have experienced throughout our travels! Any staff we came into contact with were extremely helpful and very pleasant. We have no hesitations about staying here again.

<Content>Great view! Just returned from Australia, The Four Points Shearton Darling Harbour in Sydney was our first point of call. We arrived late evening and as we were driving into the city it looked dark and miserable and we were rather concerned as to what we had come to. We pulled up at the Sheraton and checked in to the hotel we had booked a city side room but were offered an upgrade to a harbourside view if we prefered. We took a look at the cityside room and it was looking at a parking lot for an office building so we upgraded to the harbour view. We opened the door and looked out of the huge window to an amazing view of the whole of darling harbour it was really nice definatley worth upgrading. Also it was my partner's birthday and the hotel gave him chocolates and champagne as a gift which we thought was a really nice gesture. The room was pretty modern and spacious with a huge comfortabel bed, the bathroom was not great but clean and functional. The location of the hotel was pretty good for getting around the city, some nice restaurants on darling harbour. The hotel did feel geared towards business people rather than tourists but the staff where pleasant enough.

<Content>Fantastic Location Stayed here in August 2005 on our first visit to Australia. The staff were OK but only a few of them gave you a genuine smile. The 8th floor Harbour View room was excellent with a stunning view across the whole of Darling Harbour. The bed was huge but a bit too soft. The location is brilliant as all the major sites are within walking distance as well as the best shopping areas. There are some top restaurants in Darling Harbour and many others are just minutes away. You really can't go wrong with this location. We will definitely be back one day.

I suppose I shouldn鈥檛 have too high an expectation 鈥?this hotel is quite big and therefore a bit impersonal. We arrived and there was no-one to welcome us at the driveway, we found our way to the Front Desk at about 4.00 pm only to be told that they had had a big group checkout and our room would not be ready for an hour. Went back an hour later, still no room 鈥?half an hour later finally got a key, only to discover someone already in the room. Eventually allocated another room with a complimentary Harbour View upgrade. Awoken at 0700 by housekeepers having an argument in the hallway鈥es, you guessed it, argument was about a Do Not Disturb sign鈥ueued up for 30 minutes for breakfast鈥tc etc etc鈥ust a horror stay.

<Content>Lovely hotel and great location. definitely recommended We stayed here in April 2005 for 4 nights as our second stop whilst travelling around Australia. We had a very nice, comfortable and large room with one of the biggest beds we had ever seen which was also extremely comfortable. The room had all the essentials we needed plus a good shower in the bathroom. Paying the extra for a deluxe harbour view is definitely worth it as it meant we had a bigger room with a balcony and a great view of Darling Harbour. Although there are two very busy and noisy roads just below, the double glazed balcony doors are very effective and cut out all the noise so we had no problems sleeping. The hotel is very well located for all the main attractions, water taxis and ferrys. We did not bother with the hotel restaurant as there were a couple of conferences in the hotel at the time which meant that it was very busy and anyway there are some very nice restaurants in Darling Harbour that are much better. The staff were all very helpful and polite. No complaints at all and would definitely recommend this hotle to other users.

They kept asking whether we were with the convention at every restaurant and breakfast service was very slow and ordinary. Not really a Sheraton in terms of standards and the staff very rude and unhelpful.

<Content>Great hotel and location We have just returned from Sydney, we actually stayed in the hotel twice while in Australia. The hotel is of a high standard. We stay in the Standard Twin - both the city view and harbour view. Can really recommend the harbour view.Room sizes are good, the beds are very comfortable - slept like a baby. Bathrooms very good, with a powerful shower. Housekeeping was excellent.I was ill on the holiday, and the hotel staff were very good in getting me to a doctor and advising me what to do.The location is great too - much preferred the location of this hotel, than one which looked over Sydney Harbour, plus Circular key is only a short ferry trip away. Walking to circular key is only 15 easy minutes away.

<Content>Fantastic  We stayed here for part of our honeymoon back in October 2004. The location, overlooking the Harbour is amazing, and the rooms have huge windows which are perfect for sitting by and watching the world go by from. The rooms were well furnished with contemporary decor, and the staff were polite and very efficient. We had a bathroom leak when we were there which meant switching rooms at midnight, but this was handled very well, with minimum disruption and they ensured we had another room on a high floor with a great view.It's about a 15 minute walk to The Rocks area which is the perfect opportunity to orientate yourself - if I were going back to Sydney I would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent value My wife and I stayed here on our wedding night, and were more than happy with the room and service.We were planning on staying elsewhere (somewhere more upper-class)for our big night, but decided on the Four Points for the sake of convenience (we had a harbour cruise reception and wanted a hotel that we could walk to from the wharf - King St Wharf is 5 minutes away). Not wanting to pay an extra $50 for a harbour view room, we actually booked a city view room on the Sheraton official site for a very reasonable rate (about $150 cheaper than the 5 star hotels, whose services we wouldn't use anyway).When we checked in, the staff automatically upgraded us free of charge to a harbour view room upon learning that we were getting married. Both reception and the concierge desk were more than helpful during our stay.We didn't try the breakfast buffet, but instead recommend a 5 minute walk to the cafes at Cockle Bay Wharf where you can get a full breakfast for 1/2 the price.For the unfussy traveller on a budget looking for a decent hotel in a great location for sightseeing, the Four Points is the perfect choice.

<Content>Above average but only just... I have stayed here a few times for work reasons. It is not so well located for business as it is on the fringe of the city in Darling Harbour so probably better for those looking to do some sightseeing around there. It is above average but not hugely so. It is cost effective relative to the other Sheraton in the City (on the park) but that one is meant to be a better hotel anyway (ie this is a Four Points). The rooms were ok, and check in was ok. We did not eat dinner at the hotel so no comments on that. I'd rather stay at the Sheraton on the Park (if you are in the Starwood programme) but it is more expensive.

<Content>business hotel The location of the hotel was great, the view over Darling Harbour, lovely and the hotel large, modern, clean and comfortable. It was very average, nothing to rave about, with the usual impersonalised service for a large hotel chain. Its definately a business-persons hotel, but its great for a base and somewhere to come back to sleep. The walk to the opera house  bridge was about 15 mins through the shopping area, or you could get on the monorail not far from the hotel or a ferry from Darling Harbour. We found it easier to walk. Dont bother with the taxi's most of the drivers are foreigners who dont even know where they're going! One had to stop and call for directions on his radio and another we had to direct back to the hotel (we'd only been there 4 days!)

<Content>four points by sheraton, a best buy my wife and I stayed at the four points from 10-2-04 for three days. Our room was ready for us when we arrived at 8:30 a.m. We had the king size bed with a balconey overlooking the harbour. Everything about the room was a-1. It was clean, comfortable and the price was reasonable. Also the breakfasts were excelent.The only problem was we thought we were using a phone card to call ct. in the usa, but really were using their phone line. Be aware of phone rates to the states.Overall we would stay there anytime and be well taken care of.

<Content>A very good choice This hotel, facing Darling Harbour,  a 5 min walk to the Convention Center, is a great choice, no matter where you need to be. It's a very easy 10-15 min walk to Circular Quay. Although the room is not large, it has the MOST amazing bed: a Super King, that is extraordinarily comfortable.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location Overlooking the darling harbour, Four Points is in one of the best locations in Sydney. It is close to the night life of the king鈥檚 street and cockle bay wharf, 10 minutes walking from the train stations of Wynyard and Town Hall, 5 minutes walk from the bus station on York Street and couple of minutes to the ferry at Darling Harbour.Four Points is about 20 minutes from the airport. It costs about $25 by cab to get there; there are also airport shuttles for $9/person that drop you off right at the doorstep of the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 9am (check-in) time of 3pm. We left the luggage with the concierge and left to get some breakfast. They got a room ready for us in under an hour and had our luggage sent up. I鈥檇 booked a cityside room over the internet at a special pay 2, stay 3 nights offer that gave me an absurdly low price per night. Considering the low rate, I did not even ask if an upgrade was available.The hotel automatically upgraded me to a harbour side room 鈥?the only drawback being it was in the smoking section. The receptionist offered to hold a non-smoking cityside room if we decided that the smoking section was not to our liking and did not want an ozone cleaning if the smoke was heavy. I am very sensitive to smoke and was apprehensive, but the room was perfect in every way. The smoke was non-existent inside the room and we only could smell it in the corridor on the way to the elevators. The room on the fourth floor had a lovely harbour view from where we could watch the people on the Pyrmont bridge and the bright lights of the harbourside shopping complex. It had a huge king bed with luxurious linen and lots of pillows. The bathroom was marble tiled and the room itself looked like it had undergone recent renovation. On our last day at Sydney, we were so tired that we chose to stay in the room, sleep in, watch some TV and catch the ferries go by. The room was comfortable and never once did we regret staying in.My partner had to extend his stay by another day initially and then discovered it was to be two days. They offered to keep him in the harbourside room for the price of a city side one, even when we found an internet rate off the SPG site. We kept asking them changes more than once and all through the staff were very courteous and extremely helpful.If we do go back to Sydney in the future, which we are sure we will, we would love to stay there again.

<Content>Great location -Great Beds - Safes in rooms and no security concerns! Just returned from 5 night stay in Sydney - October 28. The hotel was great! We were hesitant after reading earlier reviews, but got a great deal through United Vacations. My husband is Australian and we know Sydney well. The Darling Harbour location proved great! The proximity to the ferry, great reasonable DH restaurants, walking distance to downtown and the Rocks. The hotel had a Sheraton style buffet breakfast that could be bought with 1500 spg points for two adults and they did not charge us for our 7 year old. Internet access was easy, and the staff was very helpful. We also used the hotel limo to the airport A$40. The taxi from the airport was A$36 and not nearly as exciting to our daughter. All around really good. Plus Best of all -- THE BEDS! this room was made for sleeping.

<Content>Wonderful! We stayed here at the start of October and were delighted. We got a harbour side room, and the view was fantastic. It was a nice big room, with a HUGE comfortable bed. It could've been cleaned a little better, but it was only small bits here  there. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Not only is it on the beautiful Harbour but is very near to Georges street, and only a stones throw away from the QVB, which is excellent for shopping!The restaurant downstairs is ok. While the food was nice, it was quite expensive. Definately stay in this hotel. We spent 3 weeks travelling around Oz and this was without a doubt my favourite!
