<Content>Adored the Hilton Florence Metropole! I can't say enough great things about this hotel, and I travel a lot. The front desk was extremely helpful, pleasant, and accommodating throughout my 4-day stay. The room (I was in an executive room) was so clean and elegant and comfortable. The bed was fabulous. The bathroom was space-age. My room was quiet, and I had a view of Florence. You just couldn't have asked for anything more. The shuttle into the city was very convenient; it left on the hour and returned on the half hour, except for midday. The executive lounge was wonderful. Service was outstanding, and quality of food was superb. I hope to return to this hotel someday soon. It was wonderful.

<Content>Fairly Average!!! We stayed here for two nights as part of our Globus Tour. Although the hotel room was extremely beatuiful and new, if you ever need anything from the hotel staff, including reception and restaurant, dont bother asking for help. The staff are extremely rude and arrogant, even if you speak to them in Italian. The buffet breakfast is fairly average, I have had better at a 3 star Hotel. The Hotel is not centrally located, although its only about 20 mins from the city and will cost you about 18-20EURO one way by taxi, which seems to be the only way to get there. If you want to book here for their advertised Whirlpool, DONT, as you have to pay 12EURO per person to use the pool. I have never ever had to pay extra for a swimming pool, especially at a Hilton or well known Hotel.

<Content>Don't Stay At This Hilton!!!!!!!!!!! I travel frequently for business. We toured Italy for our Honeymoon. The service at the front desk at this HIlton is the worst I have seen from Hilton. Most Hilton hotels I stayed at are very nice. When we confronted the front desk manager about our issues, she said the reason was that this hotel is not a 5 star hotel, it's just a 3-4 star hotel. Clearly there is NO desire to improve. We spent an hour trying to extend our stay with Hilton points. The front desk manager told us that though there were no rooms available on the system, she had a cancellation. She told us to book it through Hilton.com. We spent more than an hour on the phone only to find that we could not book the room. The front deck manager said she did not know the rules for booking while using Hilton poiints. So why did YOU TELL US TO DO IT! SHE HAD NO ANSEWR. I am also a GOLD member. She did not care one bit. The front desk manager should be FIRED! A job at the post office woudl suit her better. We left and went to the Hilton Garden Inn and though not as nice a hotel, the service was significantly better. If you are visiting Florence, I suggest staying at a hotel down town near the action. Both Hilton's require a taxi ride. The Venice Hilton was also outstanding. They were customer focused, accomodating, and always met us with a smile. Claudia in the exxcecutive lounge was outstanding as was Kaki at the front desk. The room was very nice. The location is beautiful. If you visit Venice, stay there!!!The Rome Hilton is also outstanding. The service is great. The views are spectacular, and the facility is top shelf. STAY AWAY FROM THE Hilton Florence Metropole.

<Content>Good Hotel, great staff We stayed four night at the Metropole. It's a good hotel, typical Hilton; but, the staff is one reason to pick this hotel. Both Serena and Jonathon at the front desk were vey helpful and accomodating.The location is not very central. The shuttle was okay, it met our needs. Taxi about 20.00 e. Book a room on the executive level if possible as this makes it a bit more comfortable stay.

<Content>Nice Place We stayed here 1 night in July 08. It is 10-15 minutes out from the city center so if you're looking for something close, then this is not the place for you. It's too far to walk. They do have a shuttle bus but like always, you have to time everything just right. A taxi ride from town is about 15 euros. The place is very, very nice. The room was great. Large king size bed. The room and bathroom are big. The bar near the lobby is really cool. The outdoor area right off of it is peaceful. We enjoyed a glass of wine, cappuccino and light snack here the day we arrived. Again, we enjoyed our time there but would not recommend to someone that wants to be near all the action and sites.

<Content>Don't Miss the Hilton Florence Metropole This truly excellent property is the best value in Italy. Two-years-new, the hotel rooms have a modern decor and are spacious, comfortable, and sparkling clean. The staff, including the business manager live to meet your every need. Pay a few dollars extra for a room that gives you access to the excutive lounge and spa. You won't be disappointed. The executive lounge provides an unbelievable breakfast and so much good food during the day/evening that you'll never go hungry. The jacuzzi pool in the spa is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The hotel is located on the outskirts of Florence and provides bus/van service to city-center. This allows you to experience all of the tourist sites in Florence and still feel like you're sleeping in the Tuscany countryside. If I had it to do over, I would have stayed at this hotel for both the Florence and the Rome part of our vacation. You can take a train or tour bus to Rome for day trips.

<Content>Avoid during the summer This 4 year old property has some impressive finishes and views, however, the hotel has started having major A/C issues.Random rooms thoughout the building started losing their A/C and they became veritable ovens. Even the Executive rooms and the Executive lounge have suffered. It was so warm in the Executive lounge one night that folks refused to stay inside the lounge and opted for the terrace spaces. Hotel staff privately explained that the hotel has been experiencing the mechanical failures for the last 8 months with growing severity. Some rooms continue to provide A/C, but it is now more likely that your A/C will not work. Management/Director claim that the issue has been addressed, but the staff contends that nothing has been done and the situation is getting worse. I can personally vouch for the continued mechanical lapses.We had to leave our room door open to allow the A/C from the hallway to help cool our room (and this was the second room we had been moved to). The third room on our final night provided moderate A/C. Compared to the first two ovens, it was a welcome change. All three rooms were Executive level rooms.Given the extremely warm temperatures that can affect Florence, I would avoid this property during the summer. The poor A/C put a real damper on our enthusiasm for the visit, and prevented us from getting any real sleep. By the third day, we were tired, hot, sticky and resigned to a poor hotel experience in Florence. I can't understand how Hilton would allow one of their properties to get this bad.Maid service is here isn't very accomodating. They slam doors and create a thunderstorm of noise in the mornings while cleaning vacated rooms. Even the sound proof door feature couldn't filter them out.The location isn't ideal if you travel by train or plan to spend a lot of time in Florence proper. The limited shuttle runs to the train station mitigate this issue to a degree, however there is a 3 hour lapse during the day (noon to 3pm) and then the shuttle stops at 8pm. Taxi rides back to the hotel from downtown run about 20 Euros.If you go during cooler months, you'll be able to enjoy some nice views from the higher floors. The Executive Lounge terrace can provide some stunning views and romantic sunsets. This hotel has so much potential. I can't tell you how sad I was to deal with the sub-par mechanical systems. No matter how stunning a hotel is, you cannot ignore the basics, especially COMFORT.

<Content>Nice place with good service I had a lovely three night stay at this property. The hotel was stylish, clean, and well-run. The staff was very helpful.The hospitality suite on the executive floor was always stocked with tasty snacks and the view from the suite was beautiful.I had a minor quibble with the design of the bathroom in my hotel room. The door of the bathroom is made of glass. While most of the door is frosted, there are strips of real glass which take away from the privacy of the bathroom. Additionally, it is unusual that the sliding window between the bathroom and room can only be opened from the room (and there are no locks to prevent it from being opened at an inopportune time).

<Content>Great Hotel Close to Airport We had reservations to stay at the Hilton Metropole the night before a a 6:00 AM flight the next morning. We returned our rental car to the airport the afternoon of our reservation. Before taking a taxi to the hotel for the night, we, luckily, decided to reconfirm our flight time for the next morning, only to find that our Alitalia flights the next day (Florence-Rome and Rome-JFK) had been cancelled!! After getting no help at the Florence airport, we contacted Delta from the hotel and were told they could fly us from Pisa to JFK the next afternoon, but we had to get to the Pisa airport by 10:30 the next morning. The staff at the front desk could not have been nicer or more helpful. They pulled up the train schedule, made our reservations and had the tickets delivered to the hotel. A taxi was ordered for the next morning to take us to the station in Florence. Everything went off without a hitch thanks to the efficiency of the front desk staff. Our room at the hotel was super nice. Everything we experienced there was first class and we definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel outside of city center We stayed at the Hilton Metropole for three nights in early June. The rooms are modern and very comfortable and the hotel staff was helpful throughout our stay; they helped us with restaurant and museum reservations. Also, we stayed on the Executive floor which provided access to a tasty breakfast, Italian snacks and beverages and internet access throughout the day. The hotel is outside the city center, but there is a free shuttle bus that goes to the main train station near Santa Maria Novella. Most evenings, we took a taxi back to the hotel (aproximately 20 euros) as the last shuttle left downtown Florence for the hotel at 8:30pm. It looks as if there will eventually be a rail line that goes out to the area where the hotel is, but this construction has not been completed.

<Content>Florence Hilton Metropole Just returned from the beautiful city of Florence, staying at the Florence Hilton Metropole. It's a nice place with comfortable rooms  a very helpful staff. Amenities are what you would expect from a Hilton, plus a little more.The only problem is the distance from town. They have a free shuttle, but the last departure is at 8 PM. And this is in a country where dinner time is usually closer to 9:30. But the front desk helped us map out our bus route,  we made it to the restaurant in Oltrarno (QUATTRO LEONI - highly recommended!) just in time.

Called front-desk, the engineer has been called. No apologies, no expectation when solved.Frontdesk is indeed a kind of disaster here, had several promises to take action the days before (internet didn't work, minibar wasn't replenished, etc.), but had to call again and again.

<Content>Not so good We stayed for 6 nights. The staff at the Executive Lounge was wonderful, helpful and personable. The lobby staff on the other hand was disorganized, uncommunicative and generally uncertain how to handle problems. The w.c. door in our bathroom let out a shrieking nose whenever opened. No one knew how to fix it, but they did assure us they would fix it after we left.[???] The rooms were small. We usually stay at Hiltons and are pleased but not with this hotel.

<Content>Service with a smile at Hilton Florence Metropole We recently visited Florence during our visit to Italy. I would like to share our experience at the Hilton Metropole hotel located in the city of Florence. It is a very beautiful hotel and the managment (doorman to the hotel manager)were all incredibly gracious, kind. and smiling. The manager herself helped us arrange the sightseeing trips, converting the travelers checks, etc. We stayed in one of the nicest room on the top floor and had a beautiful view of the city. They also offered us (we are Hilton Diamond members) awesome breakfast at the lounge. We requested a later check out time and they graciously agreed. They also had a free shuttle to the train station. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed. The service, decor, hospitality, generosity is outstanding. They have the ability to make a tired traveler feel safe, secured and wanted. I will love to visit the hotel again. I would like to recommend the hotel to all my family and friends so that they can also experience the same hospitality and warm welcome we received. Thank you Hilton Florence Metropole for taking special care of us and making our visit special.

We also needed some suggestions for local restaurants, and they recommended lovely restaurants where we had wonderful dining experience!  In addition, this hotel has a restaurant which serves five-star dishes and services. I would recommend their past dishes.We really enjoyed staying at Hilton Florence Metropole!

<Content>Wonderful hotel and customer service I recently stayed at the Hilton Hotel in Florence, Italy. It is a beautiful, modern hotel with all of the amenities. The rooms were wonderful and the restaurant was first class. The free shuttle made it easy to get into town, without being in the middle of the city. The Executive Lounge on the top floor was a nice place to go to unwind and well stocked with great food and drink. The outside patio gave you a wonderful view of the surrounding hills and the town in a distance. While this was great, even better was meeting Giorgia, who supervised the lounge. She was so wonderful and had excellent suggestions on things to do. I hope that you make it to America someday, Giorgia. If you do please look me up!Linda Kelley

The staff was very courteous and helpful. We took the shuttle into the tourist area with no difficulty. The room was modern but very comfortable after having spent the last week in various rustic BBs. As a Hilton HHonors member, access to the rooftop executive floor was fabulous! We were glad to have stayed in the historic area earlier in the week but the Hilton was a nice way to end our trip.

<Content>Great hotel with really, really nice people! If in Tuscany/Florence I would highly recommend the Hilton Florence Metropole. Most impressive to me is the service and the really, reallygood people working there. Everybody is extremely helpful and genuinely nice. I am a business traveler and have spent many nights inthis hotel and would recommend (and have recommended) to all. Also, as a business traveler I get the benefit of access to the Executive Lounge which is at the top of the hotel and has a great view of Tuscany and Florence. Also, if you also are a frequent hotelstayer/traveler and get the benefit of the lounge, you will love the people hosting in the lounge (Georgia, Elenora, and Andrea are the main people) - they are really nice and helpful and take extra steps to make you feel welcome. I enjoyed their company and I consider them my friends!I also need to make special mention of the barman, Vincenzo, who worksin the lounge on the first floor. If you stay here, please visit him!As a former bartender in New York City, I kid you not when I say I think he is the best bartender in Florence!

<Content>Awesome Staff, Great Hotel! The second stop on our honeymoon...Despite telling every hotel we were going to that we were on our honeymoon, this was the only hotel that actually did anything nice for us...They had a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room when we arrived! That was just the beginning of the great service! Front desk staff was friendly, helpful and took the time to answer every question we had and suggested a strategy for seeing Florence.Yes, the hotel is outside of the city center, but the shuttle runs hourly--on top of that, you can reserve a seat on any shuttle you want. The shuttle drops you right at the main train station, in the thick of the city...Just hop in a cab from there to get to the Uffizi, Accademia or walk to many of the other nearby sights. Someone below mentions the hotel being near a bowling alley (and a cinema too)--it was, but I don't really see how that detracted from the hotel in the slightest--it's not like we heard pins falling--we wouldn't have even known it was there if we hadn't passed it on the shuttle on the way to the city center.We were given an executive floor room (Hilton Gold). The executive lounge staff was very friendly, and kept the bar well-stocked as well as the munchies in the evening and the breakfast items in the morning. We found ourselves hanging out there every night when we got back to the room, having cocktails and enjoying the 360 degree view of Florence and the Tuscan region.The room was modern, albeit small, even by European standards...But it was sufficient for the two of us. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice.The restaurant was one of the better hotel restaurants I've eaten at...For a hotel it was reasonably priced, and they catered quite well to my bride who has gluten allergies.

<Content>Good hotel little bit away from main attractions We stayed at Hilton Florence for 2 nights. The hotel is modern and well decorated. We stayed at the executive floor and he room have a very nice view of Florence. The bed is very confortable and the room is spacious with a flat 26'' tv. The executive lounge have a nice roof with a beautiful view of the city. The service was good but not exceptional.I didn't eat at the hotel so I can't evaluate the food. The breakfest is simple compared to the others top Hilton hotels around the world. The internet access costs 5 Euros per day.The hotel is far away from the main atractions but the hotel offers a shuttle (10 min) to the central station of Florence. You can also take a bus to the center (1,50 Euro). The shuttle from hotel to the station runs at 8am, 9am, 10am, 11am, noon, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm, 6pm, 7pm and 8pm. The shuttle from central station to hotel runs 30 min later (8:30am, 9:30am, etc, etc).The hotel didn't charge the parking lot. I recommend this hotel if you don't mind to take the shuttle to go to the center of florence. If you want to stay in a walk distance location to the main attractions don't stay at this hotel. Best Regards, Theo.

<Content>Unexpected Stop Made Pleasant I unexpectedly found myself in Florence awaiting my baggage to catch up with me. I stayed at this Hilton, and they had no problem giving me a room as a walk-in.The room was nicely appointed with a comfortable bed and great shower.I didn't eat in the restaurant so I don't know how their food was. But we requested a local, good restaurant at the front desk, and were directed to a wonderful restaurant about 5 minutes walk away. The food there was spectacular, as was the service (we had a fun, wise-cracking waiter who kept us in good spirits). Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the restaurant.They had a convenient shuttle service to the train station, but I didn't take advantage of it.The only bad thing was the directions provided on the hotel's website from the airport to the hotel. Had we not spotted the hotel's shuttle (which we promptly followed right to the hotel) I think we'd still be driving around Florence!

<Content>Nice hotel in quite location with shuttle service to Florence Train Station We enjoyed our stay at this Hilton which is pretty new and modern. We didn't mind taking the shuttle which is maybe a 10 minute ride. Also they clearly communicate when the shuttle runs. A taxi isn't very expensive. We did take a taxi from the hotel to downtown to the National Car rental location near the train station and it was around $25 Euros. We would stay here again as it was clean and quite.

<Content>liked the hilton position isn't good Hotel very modern and clean and really liked the vast choice of music available through t.v. The hotel is 15 - 20 minutes outside the centre has hourly courtesy coach - it stops for 2 hours during lunch and last shuttle is at 8.30pm. As most of the good restaurants open at 7.30pm you have to get a taxi back to the hotel which incurs 15 euro taxi fare. You definitely have to plan your day carefully to avoid constant travel back and forth. Went twice to Za Za Trattoria on various recommendations it has large menu choice and a good sign all locals eat there. Get your hotel to book as it is very popular and if you like to eat out ask for this. It is 5 minute walk from train station (where shuttle drops you). Do city tour on open top bus at start of your trip it gives you the feel of the city and your bearings.

<Content>Best place The hotel was modern, had all conviences but air conditioning was a problem. Did not go lower than 26 degrees celsius.I would still recommend this hotel. Location was outside of main city, but shuttle was available. If is was later than 8:30 a cab or bus 1B for 1.2 Euros was available and will drop you off across the street.We found a great restaurant 2 blocks away which was inexpensive. Cross the street by the Pizza place, walk to the end of the block in the neighborhood and then turn right for onelong block. Fantastic pizza, calzone, etc. Hopefully the a/c will be fixed, but would stay there in a heart beat.

<Content>Sleek and modern hotel - outside the center but very nice! I stayed at this hotel outside the center of the City. The hotel is large, modern and clean. However, I really didn't like having to leave my key card in the slot to turn on the lights and regulate the air conditioning (which was not cold enough for me but I managed). The room was done in a minimalist modern style; sleek lines and modern facilities. Loved the shower with the rainfall shower head and pocket doors to slide shut for privacy between the bedroom and the bathroom. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. If you wanted to travel into town, they had a free shuttle van to take you to the Stazione Centrale (Central train station area), where you could then walk toward the Duomo, the Ponte Vecchio and other sites of Florence.I would recommend this hotel only to those who can afford the price. I truly loved the breakfast buffet, served with fresh fruits and meats and other breakfast items such as waffles and omelettes cooked to order.

<Content>Would return in a heart beat!! I stayed at this Hilton with three other friends in Oct 2006, and Loved it !! We booked this online and were a bit worried that it was located outside the tourist area, but soon learned that that was not a problem. They do provide you with a free shuttle ride; although this is only until 8:30pm we found out that after days full of walking seeing museums or churches, we had no energy to stay out late in Florence, as we had done so in other Italy cities. The rooms were very clean and beds comfortable. But most of all the staff was WONDERFUL! We had breakfast included with our room, which I highly suggest. And the breakfast buffet was the best we had in our Italy trip; it was fresh, hot and diverse. All in all a great experience, and highly recommend this hotel !!

<Content>Lovely style, lousy engineering The design of the room and particulary the bathroom were beautiful but the hotel could not fix the thermostat after 2 nights of a very hot room. They did not have a fan to give us or have a technician on call at night (this in a 15 story hotel). They claimed to have fixed the air conditioning problem after the first night but they did not and we spent another uncomfortable night. We later found out that other members of our group had similar problems. Also, the bathroom had a glass door to the sink and shower area and privacy was not possible when using the shower or tub.This hotel stay was part of a tour and it is far from the center of town and not a walkable distance.

<Content>Not Bad Some reviewers said that it was in an inconvenient location---but by setting the hotel away from the city center made the hotel better. We were surprised that this Hilton and the Hilton Calveri (in Rome) did not have air conditioners---we had to open the windows. Car in Europe are usually run on diesel and leaded fuel. Being away from the city center kept us away from the car pollution and the cigarette smoke. Italians smoke like there is no tomorrow! Vietato Fumare (no smoking)!The rooms were a bit small, but with a stylish modern flaire. A glass panel seperated the shower from the bedroom---GREAT feature!The hotel will be even better when they but in the Gym and the roof top bar. The exterior did not have the type of flaire a typical Hilton has--but it was okay.The breakfast buffet is great. Fresh squeezed blood orange juice--made before your eyes.Overall a great place.

<Content>Nice Hotel This hotel is outside the main tourist area. There is a free shuttle that takes you to and from the train station and then from there you can walk to the attractions and main areas. The shuttle runs every hour until noon and then starts again at 3pm and last trip back to the hotel is 8pm. The shuttle is about a 10-15 minute ride. A taxi cost approx 15 Euros. If you want to stay at an American hotel that is not too costly this is a good choice. The rooms are modern looking and clean. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel. The breakfast is very expensive for what is so either get the breakfast included in your room rate or eat in when you get into the main area of the city. The staff at the hotel was very helpful and pleasant. A good choice if you do not want to stay in the touristy area.

<Content>All good with this Hilton. We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in Feb 07. We had flown into Pisa airport and decided to hire a car for convenience.The location of this hotel is very good if you are driving from Pisa. The hotel is very close to the first exit on Pisa Florence motorway and easy to find with the directions mentioned on the website. The parking is free and plenty. It is a bit out of town but the shuttle bus makes up for it. Also there is a bus from the city center to the hotel for 鈧?.5 or Taxi for only 鈧?0.The rooms were clean, modern but a bit small. Not a big problem if you do not have to spend a lot of time in the room. Some members have mentioned previously about the bathroom with glass doors and looking into the bedroom through another glass panel. This is true and must be considered if you are sharing the room with someone other than a partner.The bar, the restaurant for breakfast and dinner served good food and staff was attentive.All in all good 4star hotel.

<Content>I give this hotel a definate maybe The hotel was very clean and almost sterile. When we arrived, the doormen nearly tripped over each other to grab our suitcases and they always were pleasant. The people manning the front desk were pleasant as well, but through more than a few problems, they were useless. The rooms are spotless and the beds are very comfy. The TV is nice, but didn't find anything to watch in English except CNN world; no movies, no nothing. I now it's Italy, but it's a Hilton and you would expect more. The full breakfast was the best! Delicious, fresh, and more than enough staff to cater to our every whim. The underlying feeling, which we found all throughout our trip was that they really weren't happy to help you, but had to. Do not stay in this hotel if you are rooming with a casual friend or family! The bathroom door is glass! the door off the bathroom where the toilet is, is glass with a teeny bit of frosted glass. If that isn't enough of a kicker, there is a window in the bathroom that looks into the main room... and... if you try not to see someone in there, you might catch a glimpse anyway due to where the full length mirror is.. a beeline view into the bathroom. I roomed with my sister and although we are grown adults, we were uncomfortable with going in there, especially showering.. The sink is made of glass and sits on a shelf of marble.. beautiful, but not practical; water everywhere if you aren't careful.. same with the tub... there is a handheld water jet in the tub that sprayed everywhere and with marble floors, it's trecherous! Stayed there three nights and loved the shuttle downtown.

<Content>Stay away from this Hilton The best advice I can give is to stay somewhere else. As other reviews have mentioned the hotel is in the middle of nowhere and the shuttle only runs to 8:30PM. But after learning the bus, you can get back as late as 11:30PM for a couple Euros. What really upset me about this hotel was the service, very poor unlike any other Hiltons. I was on my honeymoon and staying here for 3 nights. Two of those nights were on a rewards stay and one had been prepaid ahead of time as a wedding gift. Upon checking this seemed very difficult to get across, I tried to just pass it off as a language barrier and thought it was finally figured out, until after the second night the bell hop comes into our room while we are still in there to drop off someone else鈥檚 bags. Fortunately we were dressed and about to head out, but I was furious. The in room services didn't work and no one knew how to fix them, no Internet, no movies, no music. Then when checking out they tried to double charge me for the third night. Had to go through 3 different people (and some yelling) before they finally figured it out. Everybody I talked to that was staying there was having some sort of problem with the Hotel and staff. I would NEVER stay here again and would never recommend it to anyone.

<Content>It Was A Hit With Us! What a beautiful hotel. So different than any Florentine hotel we have stayed in. The staff was wonderful and very accomodating. Matteo helped find someone to book a trip to Tuscany. If was fantastic. His name was Guido and he is a resident of Tuscany. He took us into the hills and for lunch in a wonderful cafe. We stopped for wine and olive oil and to visit a beautiful vineyard. Highly reccomended. The hotel restaurant was a little too brightly lit but that is the only complaint. The ravioli was home made and terrific. The staff very cheerful and could not do enough.Yes, the shuttle was a pain in the neck but we used it everyday to go into town and never was left off as we got there 15 minutes before and waited. Yes, you did have to take a cab back in the evening but so what it only took about 10-15 minutes in the evening and cost about $12 euro's.Oh yes, the view we had from our room was worth every penny. The beds were the best we slept in while in Italy.We would stay here again in a minute!

<Content>Stranded at the Hilton Metropole We stayed in the Hilton Metropole for 5 days during our recent trip to Florence and left earlier than planned because we found the hotel so unsatisfactory. This hotel is located in a deserted field way outside Florence (technically outside the city limits). The Hilton van to downtown Florence only runs until 8pm, which means if you wish to stay in Florence at night, be prepared to pay for a cab or ride the public bus. During rush hour, the van ride can take 45 minutes. Additionally, the staff at the Metropole is extremely incompetent and tried to charge us even though we were using our Hilton points. The hotel might be luxurious, but who cares when you are stuck way out in the suburbs? Moreover, some of the modern luxuries are downright frustrating and we had to make several calls to figure out how to use the shower and the lights.

<Content>Better than I was Prepared For! While true, this hotel is not in central Florence, it worked out very well for us. This was our third trip to Florence so we knew our way around and didn't find it necessary to stay in central Florence. Its convenient access to the major roadways was a plus for day trips in Tuscany. We found our room to be very nice - more spacious than any older central Florence hotel that we have stayed in - and certainly more comfortable beds and pillows than the older hotels.We used the hotel shuttle for two roundtrips into the city. The only time we had an issue with the shuttle being full was when we tried to take the last shuttle (8:30) from the city and there were simply too many people wanting to go back at the same time. We ended up taking a 10 minute taxi ride from the train station back to the hotel at a cost of 11 euro (not 20 as many others have posted).I'll certainly consider this hotel again for my next trip.
