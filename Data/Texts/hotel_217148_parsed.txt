<Content>Rundown and not clean We were drawn by the price and availability. This Ramada is old and dirty. The rooms were not clean. We were put on the 3rd floor but soon realized the Elevator Motor Assembly was behind the wall right behind the headboard! It made a squealing awful noise with each passenger ALL NIGHT LONG. It was impossible to sleep. They did move us to another room the following day when we asked to change. They didn't seem happy. This other room was even dirtier and older.The sheets were thread bare and the carpets dirty. I saw on my credit card account they charged us a higher rate other than what I signed on my bill.The saving grace was the free shuttle to Logan and the T. Free breakfast is offered, breads,yogurt, and hot waffles.If you are not going to be in your room at all you may like this place for the price. NOT walking distance to anything ,but cheap.

<Content>Best night's sleep - ever! My family and I had some reservations (pardon the pun) when we saw this place since it seemed old and a little musty. However, the rooms were comfortable and I had the best night's sleep I've ever had thanks to the awesome pillows! I even had an amazing dream that allowed me to awaken with a beautiful, spiritual connection to the Universe. I certainly didn't expect that from a cheap hotel stay.

<Content>Convenient, but not very clean STAY DETAILSJuly 19-21, 20081 queen room, 1 handicapped queen roomPrice: $129.99/night Government rate at Ramada.comYou may get a cheaper rate walking in instead of reserving online. There are hotel coupons in almost every rest stop in the highways to Boston. However, it was peak season (summer) so we decided to reserve in advance.LOCATIONThe location is South Boston, but it was still convenient. There was free scheduled shuttle to the JFK/UMass subway station (MBTA) and the airport. There are restaurants on site, the Phillips candy/chocolate store and a family entertainment complex that had bowling, arcade, pool and more. Stores such as CVS, National Wholesale Liquidator and other stuff, are just across the street. The location is the best asset of this property, but that was it.PREMISESThe place had ample parking and seating in the lobby. The hotel layout was very poorly planned. Other reviewers complained that the hotel was a maze, and it was. Even the front desk staff got confused. To go to one side of the hotel, you will have to go through at least 3 doors.STAFFThe staff were friendly, but they need to be more knowledgeable. We had to switch rooms because the first rooms we had were too far from the exit and we had a handicapped kid with us. A staff gave us wrong directions to get to the rooms, but he was apologetic. The keys to one of the rooms weren't working and I had to go back to front desk twice. The front desk didn't have a map of the area, only downtown Boston and Cambridge.ROOMSThere was a strong smell in the rooms. It looked like housekeeping sprayed too much air deodorizer to mask other smells. I didn't think the rooms were too clean. One of the rooms we booked (handicapped) had poop in the toilet. The other room was alright, but when we tried to use the extra pillows in the 'closet', they smelled like sweat. We think housekeeping just stocked them in the closet without cleaning them. The closets weren't really closets, they were just a separate space with clothes rack and hangers. One of the rooms had a desk, a small round table, two chairs, a tiny bathroom (with a tub), and the sink right outside the bathroom. The handicapped room didn't have the small round table. It had a bigger bathroom, but with no tub. The sink was inside the bathroom. Air-conditioner was great, but it made some noise which didn't really bother us.AMENITIESPoolThe pool was very small and goes from 4 to 9 ft deep. I saw the lifeguard check the quality of the water every morning which was good.BreakfastContinental breakfast was included with the rate and was served from 6am-10am. At the two days we were there, they didn't serve the same 'entree'. The first morning, we had waffles which were delicious. You could make your own waffle, but this wonderful lady (staff) offered to make them for those who want them. The second morning, we had scrambled eggs. On both days, there were bagels, bread, toasts, muffins, fruits, cereals, yogurt, juices, coffee.InternetThere was free wireless internet access and the speed was good. You would need to ask front desk for a password to access it. If you plan to access the internet, take your laptop with you. To use the hotel's own computer to access the internet is not free. I believe it was $7/hr.

<Content>Great Place to Stay, especially for families looking at colleges. This is a wonderful hotel situated at the JFK/UMASS stop off the red line. the hotel shuttle not only will pick you up at the airport, they run a shuttle to the red line every 15-30 minutes all day long till 11 pm.You can get to any where you are going within minutes, and for friends who want to visit you, the local is situated so that friends and family dont have to fight the Boston proper traffic.The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast of cereals, fruit, juice, coffee, rolls, eggs, bacon as well as coffee in your room each morning when you awaken.The rate is very very reasonable, and they honor a AAA discount to all members.A great place to stay.. clean, neat, friendly, computer access, free shuttles, and great breakfast.

<Content>Major negatives but some pluses too My review here is probably going to be charitable to Ramada. I checked in after a long flight in from Vegas (where I now live). I was placed in a room in a glassed in, isloated corridor. The corridor featured people coming and going at all hours and people slamming doors - combined with that, my door lock seemed to barely work. This may have been the worst hotel I have stayed in for safetly. Fortunately, the desk did move me when I called at 2:30am and I felt better about the second room. In summary:-The first room/corridor I had did not seem safe (would not recommend for a single woman or family in any scenario).-The rooms were dirty and furnished in mediocre/poor manner.-The price was very good for Boston ($125 per night with AAA discount).-The breakfast appeared extensive and was complementary.-The shuttle, as others report, was convenient.

<Content>Worst hotel Ive ever stayed in I went on a school trip, and I have been in a lot of hotels... including a lot of crappy hotels. And this one takes the cake. EASILY!!! When we arrived after a 12 hour drive from Canada, my roommates and I had to wait for the family staying in our room to leave (it was several hours past check out time) and we had to leave our luggage in an office and go accross the street to a bowling ally to use the washroom and freshen up (after a 12 hour bus ride, all we wanted to do was be in our room!)When we got back, we walked down a hallway with roof leaks and wet carpets (i could see my breath!) to our room. When we got into our room, we could barely move because it was so cramped. All night I was freezing because of the wet floors and open windows. Everything was disgusting and dirty too.There is a cool chocolate factory near the hotel, which was the only good thing about staying there. Except for the fact that all of the chocolate we bought and kept in our room was gnawed on by mice when we went out.The staff was also quite rude.I would never reccommend this hotel to anyone. Not even to my worst enemy. I'm pretty sure if I had stayed longer than 4 days, I would have gotten the plague.

<Content>Indifferent and unreliable We stayed as part of a conference package and I can鈥檛 say it was an entirely positive experience but neither was it the worst Hotel I have stayed at.There were some good things about it鈥he breakfast was good.鈥he shuttle service to and from the airport and to the T station was free and fairly reliable but was often overcrowded.鈥ome of the staff were nice.Now for the bad stuff.If you are keen on clean, its not the place for you. I found a hair inthe bath on arrival and the vent in bathroom was very dirty. I am fairly tolerant about these things but if you like a place that has been well cleaned so that previous occupants are no longer in evidenceyou may not feel comfortable here.The toilet malfunctioned in such a way that it flooded the bathroom and some of the rest of the room in the middle of the night. When we reported this the following day the receptionist said 鈥渞oom?鈥? No apology no surprise.When I suggested that he might like to apologise he said 鈥?what was the trouble ..running all night?鈥?and when I explained about the flood he said 鈥?Oh that is a bad one鈥?All of this told me it was not an isolated incident. The toilet did run all night on the following two nights but I resorted to amateur plumbing. If you don鈥檛 like this sort of help the staff approach to hotel keeping again the Ramada Boston is probably not for you.The location is far from downtown and the shuttle comes every half hour to JFK. Since we were all at a conference together we generally ignored the bus being full and got on in any case. There are apparently no Taxis at JFK T station so if you don鈥檛 enjoy being stranded in the cold for some time again you should consider other options. BTW probably not the Comfort that is run by the same family on the same site.I suppose you might want to stay there if it was very cheap and everywhere else was booked but my recommendation is definitely look elsewhere.

<Content>Horrible experience We booked this room as our first night on a 3 week New England/East coast tour. We stayed only 1 night...thank goodness. We had booked a King room, large room. We were told it was one of their oversized rooms. When we arrived we were taken to a very small room with queen sized bed. There was literally no room to move around in the room. The room was not clean...it was filthy. Even the sheets looked dirty. The carpet looked like someone had changed the oil of their car on it. The bathroom tiles were chipped and grout dirty. There were unsavory types lurking around. Security for the area we had to walk to our room was non-existant. When I took my confirmation to the front desk and told them we had booked a large, king room, we were told that there were no other options for us...this room would have to do. They said when you book online, you just get what you get. They were rude. I showed them that the confirmation came from their own organization but they didn't seem to care. The girl who helped us was eating while checking us in. Kind of disgusting. The breakfast room was fine and the breakfast plentiful. When I pointed out that we had paid for the larger room she said that we already had a good deal for the room but she begrudgingly gave us a 25.00 credit to our bill. The location is too far from Boston. Shuttle service to the Subway was good going there...but when we wanted to return there were too many people who wanted to return and we had to wait twice to get on the shuttle. When the shuttle comes which was a van, the large group of people just pushed and shoved to get on. It didn't matter if you were waiting for an hour...new people just got on first. There were some young people who were left 3 times. The shuttle driver said there would be another shuttle coming shortly and we would wait the 30 minutes for the next one. Since it comes every 30 minutes we had to wait 1 hour and 40minutes to get a ride back. We finally waited by the curb and pushed our way on too. Otherwise we would still be waiting there. We would have just taken a cab if we had known, but the location of the shuttle stop was not in an area that cabs frequent. I would not ever stay here again and probably not ever in another Ramada facility after the experience with the staff

<Content>Nice staff, good breakfast, ok rooms, bad hallways Lovely staff, they are all very helpful from especially those on reception, the ladies in the breakfast room and the cleaning staff. The lobby, business centre and breakfast room are of an ok standard. However, the hallways are horrible absolutely horrible. No amount of refurbishment could fix these corridors. Be prepared to run to your room and hopefully get the key to work before weirdos catch up with you. Do not delay in these corridors, we had to wait for a really drunk guy to get lost before we could go back to our room after breakfast at 8.30am. Also make sure you bring bedroom slippers, while the rooms are kept clean the carpets are filthy. I put on white socks and walked around for 5 min my socks were filthy.. disgustingly so.The shuttle is a great service and very cost effective while on holiday or business. It is not an ideal tourist base but is probably ok for a 1 night business stay. It is not for the shopper either, too much effort in bringing your bags back via the T to the shuttle and then to the hotel.

<Content>Not bad, but not good Typical American motel. Bit far from Downtown but free shuttle to and from JFK subway every 30 mins. Buy a $15 weekly ticket as most major attractions are on the subway route. Good sized room. Basic but clean. Freeport Tavern offers reasonably priced food and drink. Whatever you do, don't call the uk from your room phone. $84 for 3 calls to the uk totalling 18 mins! It's cheaper to use your mobile. Also mixed up my bill with someone elses and overcharged my cc by $360 which they quickly recified when I called them on arrival back in the uk.

Room good size and clean. some renovation work going on so public areas a little dirty. Pool was fine- quiet for majority of the day. Shuttle bus both from airport and subway was great, frequent in all directions. Overall the hotel was fine. Great bars in nearby Dorchester, a short cab ride away.

<Content>ramada good! I recently stayed at the Ramada and let me say that I was pleasantly surprised with comfort and convenience for the price of this hotel. I have read some negative reviews on this site and I do not understand where these people are basing their opinions on. The staff was helpful and friendly, the rooms where clean and the location was convenient to the T train. Also, do not forget the low price. I traveled with my kids and they found it appealing with the arcade/bowling alley next door. Breakfast was good with the waffles, pancakes, and other good breakfast items. I stayed five nights and would go back. I paid around $100 or so bucks a night, you are not doing better than this place anywhere in or near Boston. TRUST ME ON THAT ONE.

<Content>Good for the price  We stayed at this hotel for 3 days. Contrary to the reviews that I read, the staff was very helpful and friendly. In the past I have found that most people that write extremely bad reviews will never be satisfied. The rooms were clean, plenty of room. The beds were not as comfortable as our own bed but we were not on a luxury vacation. The breakfast area was a little cramped when getting your food/ beverage. The pool was a nice little addition. Anyone who has stayed in Boston or the Boston area knows that a pool is a hard find.The shuttle service was exceptionally prompt, and we were able to get a ride directly to a great restaraunt, and picked up also. Anyonewho is going into the area and has activities planned, for the price and location it is worth the stay. All the complainers......Go into downtown Boston and easily pay in excess of 250 a night. The Park Plaza and Jury's always have vacancies.

<Content>The reviews don't lie! I read reviews of all hotels I frequent. Many times there are poor reviews of hotels I find fantastic. This is one hotel I should have heeded the warnings. The hotel staff is terrible. First, they gave us a key to a room already occupied. When we returned to the front desk with all of our luggage they couldn't get the card key system to work so getting another room took about 45min. The hotel is dated, and the rooms were worse. I know floors are dirty in hotels, but these actually blackened my white socks. We asked for a baby crib and had to call twice to get it (10 at night). We had to go down to the front desk to get a sheet for it even though the guy that delivered it said housekeeping would bring one up to us. No I'm sorry! was given at any time. I am now talking to Hotels.com about refunding my first night because my plane was canceled. When we talked to front desk about the cancellation, they said to talk to Hotels.com. and they would have no problem refunding our money for the first night. After a long discussion with them, they reluctantly refunded my money.

<Content>Not Great; Breakfast OK The hotel is a short drive from downtown Boston. I stayed here for one night on July 1, 2007. The room was decently clean and included a refrigerator and a safe. The double beds seemed small and not very comfortable. The A/C was loud when running, though it did cool OK. The website advertised a fitness room, but I was disappointed to find out that the fitness center was not at the hotel, but you had to drive to another nearby hotel and show your key to use the center. The outdoor pool seemed small. The best thing about the stay was the breakfast and even that wasn't great. It included 2 hot items: French toast and scrambled eggs. Also included cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, apples,  bananas. One issue I had was that there were no clean trays to put your breakfast items onto. Instead, there was a stack of dirty trays. No effort was being made by the staff to put out clean trays nor was there an area to put your dirty trays when finished.I got the room at a rate of $119 a night, but had expected more for the money.

<Content>You can't belive a word they say The room was clean, though the air conditioning system's operation was unpredictable. We attended the eBay Convention and asked whether or not we should drive or take their shuttle. We were told that the shuttle was definitely better, as the parking at the convention center was $20 - $30, and traffic was terrible. When we asked about the frequency and reliability of the shuttle, we were told that the shuttle would leave every 30-40 minutes, but that when we were ready to return to the hotel, all we needed to do was call the hotel and a shuttle would pick us up within 15 minutes of our calling. Although they had several shuttle vehicles of varying sizes, they never were able to accommodate all of the people who were ready to be transported, especially on the return trip. The 15 minute pick-up promise was a misquote, to say the least, as it always took more than 45 minutes for a shuttle to pick us up, and never were there enough seats for all who had called. Calls to the hotel manager were answered with reports that the manager was not on the property. Additionally, parking at the Convention Center was $10 and the traffic was never bad, and we would have gladly paid to park and drive ourselves, rather than be among the last persons to be picked up from the Conventiion Center each evening. We will never recommend this place to anyone, and will never again lodge here.

<Content>Just can not recommend this hotel The staff at the front desk are not friendly. The continental breakfast that is suppose to be for guests, is eaten every morning by the staff, who are also sitting at the tables. They were loud and rude and yelling back and forth the dining area to each other. I stayed here for five days and this was the routine every morning. The gym facilities are NOT on-site, you have to travel up the road to the Ramada's sister hotel, the Days Inn for the gym. This is not told to you on their website. The hotel is old and dated and the guests are very noisy with their coming and going at all hours. A group of kids were running through the halls on the evening of May 9, 2007 at 11:30 pm and the staff did not have anyone address the situation. I found the rooms to be fairly clean but the air conditioning was very poor. The temperature in my room was 80, with the air conditioning on, the high today was about 84 [May 10, 2007]The hotel shuttle service was good. The hotel is a bit too far from the city, which makes touring inconvenient. I won't stay here again and I would not recommend the hotel to anyone either.

They coulldn't answer any of our questions about how to get around Boston or what to do. And when it rained, the floors in all the hallways were soaked!!

<Content>Shuttle service was great! Just what we were looking for. It was very good. The only downfall was that the hotel was a little far from the city... but the shuttle took us right to the JFK museum and to the T (subway station). We didn't need a car -- great for our trip. Rooms were clean, well-kept, and the continental breakfast was good (although, as stated in prior reviews, the TV in the room was loud, so we generally went back to our room to eat). We stayed for a week, and had very few complaints. Added bonus: this hotel was just across the parking lot from a bowling alley, souvenir/chocolate shop, and attached to a Tavern/Fine dining restaurant.This was a good value for a great experience for our honeymoon.

<Content>Disappointed Stayed at this hotel in October 2006 and was disappointed with the accommodations. The rooms are very dated, the carpet was dirty and in need of replacement, toilet ran constantly after flushing until we fixed it ourselves. Room very stuffy and hot and when the air conditioner was on it was so loud we could hardly sleep. Front desk staff could be very unhelpful at times. The breakfast offered was decent, but the room it was held in was very loud with the TV blaring and the staff all visiting there. The hotel could be a nice place to stay if they spent some money and did some updating and hired some new staff, who were more people friendly. Had a very tired look about it. The shuttle was handy and worked well for us. We ate in the Freeport Tavern one night and wouldn't go back as the service was poor and our server never came back after taking our order. Same thing happened in the bar. If I returned to Boston I would look for something closer to the city center.

<Content>Disappointed I thought it would be OK hotel for money, but I was WRONG!!! The rooms are very small and have some kind of strange smell. The location is very bad. The highway is on one side and the other side has a very busy road. If you need to get to the subway, you should wait for their shuttle. If you miss it or there are a lot of people waiting for it, you will be standing there for another 30-40 minutes. There is only one restaurant around this hotel (you can just walk there). Everything else is far away. The front desk people have some attitude that makes you feel that you have to be thankful that you're staying there. Sometimes they can also be very rude. I would not recommend staying there, unless you want to experience disappointment like me.

<Content>decent for a quick overnight stay, but not worth the money The hotel needs a complete make over. The hallways are well worn. This is one step up from an old motel. The room however was clean and well decorated, but small. Furniture and wall paper were nice. The rug was clean, but worn. The bathroom sink had cigarette burns even though the room was billed as a non-smoking room. Wall paper over the shower was pealing. The room was pricey given these facts and also the fact that it's kind of in the middle of nowhere. It's a short drive to Boston so it's an OK location. I wouldn't stay here again for the price I paid, but if you are looking for somewhere to stay on your way to another location or because you are visiting someone nearby, it's better than a motel. The hotel staff was very nice. Remodel the hotel or drop the prices.

<Content>smelly This hotel limps across the threshhold of adequacy.The cable works ... mostly.The AC works ... mostly.The wireless network works ... mostly.The fitness center is in a 'sister hotel' a few blocks away.The shower-head seems placed to accomodate midgets (I'm unusually tall, but even so it was fairly ludicrous).The room was otherwise adequate -- clean, etc.The hotels biggest problem is that it appears to be a converted motel -- it looks as if someone put up cheap windows to create hallways where once there were open walkways to the rooms. But the rooms all still have wall-unit ACs, which exhaust into these hallways. As a result, if it's warm out, the hotel literally stinks and the hallways become oven-like.

<Content>Served the purpose We were there with a group of boys for a basketball tournament. The rooms were ok but not great. We had requested a non-smoking room but, even though there was a sign on the door indicating it was non-smoking, it was obvious that at some time in the past, it had been a smoking room. The underlying smell never leaves. The room was clean, however. Our room was right next to one of the outdoor exits and we constantly heard the door opening and closing all night and voices outside our door. I wouldn't recommend this room to anyone although the inner rooms seemed better. The bed linens were pretty old - I could almost poke my fingers through the sheet.On the positive side, there was free wireless internet which was dependable. Also, next door the Freeport Tavern serves a nice, casual dinner. There is also a restaurant attached to the Tavern which I understand to be pretty good.The breakfast was ok but nothing out of this world. Not much left even at 8:15. The fresh waffles were nice if you wanted to wait in line 10 minutes.All in all, the hotel served the purpose for the group we were there with but it is not a hotel I would necessarily return to.

<Content>Good Value for Park, Sleep  My wife and I stayed at the Ramada for one night under the Park, Sleep  Fly Package. This deal allows you to stay one night and park your car for up to 14 nightsfor flights from Logan airport. There is a shuttle that runs every hour on the hour to Logan ( 24 hours a day). The hotel is pretty basic and somewhat old but the personnel were very friendly and helpful. The shuttle takes about 20 minutes to get to Logan so there is a bit of a wait on your return to Boston because you need to call for the shuttle after you collect your luggage. The breakfast buffet looked good but our flight left too early for us to do much except grab a cup of coffee. We paid $149 plus tax so, all in all, for about the same price as parking at Logan, we got to sleep over in Boston and arrive for our flight without having had to make the two hour drive from Maine on the day of our flight. In short, it ain't fancy but it gets the job done.

<Content>Okay The double queen room that I booked was of an average size, pretty much what one would expect from a Ramada.However, since I had unwittingly booked a smoking room, and so it reeked of smoke. Also it looked as though it had not been redecorated since 1983 (quite why such a specific date I do not know either).The hotel is located outside the city centre, and takes about 20 mins door to door to the Park St metro, having first taken the 5 minute ride on the half hourly courtesy bus to the local T stop. Occasionally the bus arrived full (from the nearby Holiday Inn i think) and so there could be quite a wait, but on the whole the bus drivers tried to solve this by making extra trips.The bus stops at 11 pm, but apparantly you can call and they will pick you up, but since Boston seems not to be a particularly heavy partying town, this is less likely to be a problem.The included-in-the-price buffet was reasonably good, consisting of cereals, toast, bagels and even a waffle maker.

<Content>A Good Deal I was satisified with this Ramada Inn. Some of the negative items are true, like the curtain wall reduces fresh air circulation. I bet this is appreciated in the winter. In the summer I found it only mildly offensive.It's true the T shuttle can fill up, but timing ones activities could eliminate that problem. For instance, I didn't have a problem if I stayed in the city until 7 PM.They charge for local calls, but will cut internet access by half. There is several restaurants and shops near, do be careful crossing the streets. The pool has a life guard.

<Content>Great Package We used the Ramada Inn Boston's Sleep, Park and Fly plan on our way to Jamaica last week and it was great. The cost of the hotel was very reasonable and allowed us to drive down to Boston (a three hour drive)the day before our very early flight to Jamaica (4:30am). Plus the cost to park the car, stay at the hotel and the shuttle to the airport and then back to our car upon return was not much more than the local Park and Fly deals. The hotel is centrally located to everything or they have a shuttle that runs to the T (Boston's subway system). We found our room to be very clean and comfortable and the staff was very accomidating.

<Content>Not so good for family of 4 in the winter Our trip to the New England Aquarium (Feb 25-27) included 2 nights at the Ramada Inn Boston. Place looked and sounded great by the websites I looked at and by the pictures, but when we got our room, we were very disappointed.Room was so incredibly small and had 2 double beds which left such little room for more than one person moving around. The heater in the room blew cool air (in 30+ degree weather) and blew so hard aross the room, we had to take a drawer out of the desk to stand it up on end to block the force of the air. The bathroom was also teeny tiny. Toilet paper was across from you so far away that you had to be very tall to reach it.Outside the room in the hallway was like being outside - literally. All windows in the hallway overlooking the pool which I am sure is great for summer, but for winter, with the walls coming down and stopping 6 inches from the floor, the cold air coming in from outside made the hallways as cold as outside. Of course, this cold also got in your room if your bed was close to the wall.Left the heat on 68 when we left so it would be somewhat warm when we returned only to find the maid turned it down to 60 even knowing that we were there another night. We were not too happy about that.They did nothing about the ice on the sidewalks around the hotel and my 7 year old daughter took a terrible fall outside one of the doors after we had dinner. The complimentary continental breakfast was nothing more than cereal, juice, coffee, bagels and toast. If you got there past 9:15, everything was gone and you were out of luck. The people running the breakfast were very rude and short to everyone I saw ask for a toasted bagel or toast.Boston Bowl, right next door was poor. The game room's games were mostly broken and did not add up scores properly to give you the right number of tickets for you to give your kids. Bowling candlestick was pretty good except parents of younger children did not keep them off the lanes no matter how nicely you asked. Sometimes there were 6 young kids (4 and under) in my lane. The pool tables were fantastic though.The Tavern in the building next door affiliated with Ramada was fantastic for dinner and we were all extremely pleased with the very tasty and well presented food. Service was very good.I would not stay at this hotel again. With there being so many hotels in the whole Boston vicinity, I have no doubt that we could find something the same price with nicer and more importantly larger rooms and better breakfasts. Would definitely go back to that tavern though....

<Content>Excellent value for my money, great location I spent 2 nights at this property for only about 70$ a night. I enjoyed everything. The room was nice and clean, coin laundry in working condition, front desk helpful (they provided extensive information and even a map), the shuttle service reliable and great! I am surprised to read about the dissatisfaction with the shuttles. When I was there it also happened that more of us were waiting at the T station than there are van sits. However the driver immediatelly radioed the hotel and another shuttle was there in 5 minutes. On our first morning the door lock got stuck. We called the front desk and they were with us instantly. We got out through the window and went to Boston, while they repaired the lock and even made an apology for the trouble in the evening when we got back.On my next trip to Boston I will certainly stay there again.

<Content>A B for the Ramada Inn. I stayed here for two nights this December and I was very impressed by the Ramada Inn. I would give this a good rating -- the room and bathroom were clean. There was cable television and complimentary breakfast each morning. Although the hotel is a bit out of the way from downtown Boston, there's a courtesy shuttle that travels between the hotel and the closest T station.

<Content>What we expected ! We booked online and came for 7 nights; from TripAdvisor we knew there were problems with damp. However on the 3rd floor we were unaffected, the room was clean, tidy and spacious. Their shuttle service to  from Logan and JFK/Umass was excellent. A de-luxe breakfast it was every morning - most enjoyable. Staff were obliging, if under pressure a bit when busy - the drivers couldn't have done more for us, prompt and pleasant.All in all we will stay here again if we visit Boston.
