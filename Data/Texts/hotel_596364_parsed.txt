<Content>Not a very good experience Have just been back recently from a 10 days holidays in Bali. Stayed the last 4 nights in Villa Puri Ayu. After spending 5 nights in 2 other villas in Seminyak, to say we are dissaponted with Villa Puri Ayu is an understatement. We stayed in the 'new' emerald wing. Granted the price was very good, but as soon as we enter our room, the amount of mosquitos that is buzzing around in the room is amazing. There must be hundreds of them. Everytime we moved the curtain, 10 or more mosquitos would fly off. We had to fumigate the room, emptying a big bottle of baygon and left the room for a couple of hours. It did the trick the first night, as evidenced by the dead mosquitos on the floor, but by morning more mosquitos were buzzing around. Everytime we left the room for a trip, we sprayed baygon to get rid of the mosquitos.Water was a major problem. No hot water in the basin in the bathroom. A trickle of water for showering, hand held shower doesn't work and the toilet got blocked on the second night. A quick call to the Reception, an engineering team turned up and spent 45min unblocking the toilet. When they finished and left, they also left a piece of s**t lying on the bathroom floor.Other niggles:We asked for extra pillow and told that as the hotel is full, there is no spare.Towel provided in the bathroom were old, worn towel that in some areas its as thin as a T-shirt. Towels in provided for the pool however is much better, a shame we can't take these into the rooms.Location is ok, appearance is ok but the experience we had is dissapointing. We do liked the pool, apart from that nothing else is any good.

<Content>What a dream place! Stayed here for a week with two cildren and wife. We ended up in Villa Diamond, with 4 bedrooms, 5 showers, own lap pool, etc. The place was heaven on earth!The fact it was a 30 second stroll to the beach in one direction, and 30 seconds to a busy Jalan in the other, made the whole experience so much nicer.Freindly staff, simple breakfast, and cheap internet access.Highly recommended!

<Content>Some good, some bad Okay, plus points. I found the staff friendly and fairly helpful. The pool was good although the description of two pools is not realistic as one is just a big plunge pool. The room was fine. Basic and clean although it had an odd (too me) outside bathroom. Prices are good. I made friends with some other people at the complex and got to see some other rooms. Standards vary a lot. Some, as the last poster pointed out do not keep the bugs at bay. Newer units on the opposite side of the hotel are much more modern and are fine.Bad points. Again as stated by the last poster the private beach is a joke, the hotel brochure said we would have access to a gym at another hotel. This agreement had expired and not been renewed. It was only sorted on the day i left. The wireless internet was okay if slow but failed and was still broken when I left and was expensive to my mind. Lastly their were two power failures of about two hours over a period of three days. These were not general power cuts but failures in the hotels main electrical board.General feeling is that this place needs some real investment to even out the experience.

<Content>Never again!!! 300 Euros stolen in our safety box and almost a day spent at the police station were a very bad moment for us. The hotel is OK for the price but we felt like we paid twice. They have a master key for digit code safety box (ours were closed when we arrived so they opened it in front of us). 4 days after we arrived they stoled a part of our money (maybe they were thinking we wouldn't notice...) The boss did not believe us so we had to go to the police but nothing will happen and we won't get our money back...

<Content>Old Bali Hospitality Stayed here in early July escaping Australia's winter. Booked directly with the hotel on a recommendation from a friend. Literally located between the Sanur Beach Hotel and Puri Santrian down a small lane away only 100m from the beach.We stayed in a garden suite apartment / villa with a fully equipped kitchen for those who want to self cater but a large refridgerator was all we needed for the mandatory Bintang. Whilst comfortable and clean the villa is in need of a freshen up and larger towels would be helpful. The garden area with sun beds and covered 'warong' provided the choice of relaxing indoors or outdoors in the privacy of a gated garden villa/apartment.The staff were friendly and very hospitable. They will meet and greet you at the airport if you want and we would recommend you do that especially if you arrive late at night.You have a choice of 2 pools. The large pool by the bar / dining area was delightful with plenty of room to relax around the pool in a variety of sun beds and chairs. The smaller more private plunge pool allowed you to escape from the general pool area when families were present.Being a small property of 20 rooms or so meant no major crowds or hassle and meant our stay was quiet and enjoyable.Would recommend for everyone and anyone.

<Content>Just wonderful My family (wife and two teenage daughters) stayed in the Emerald Wing accomodation. This was very nice with excellent beds and sheets in two bedroom (both doubles), huge lounge/dining and self contained kitchen. Plasma TV and DVD working. Very spacious and right by the pool. Thoroughly cleaned every day by team of 3 staff, good quality clean towels. Only had small problem with basin plumbing in one ensuite and tap falling off in kitchen (seems to be routine faults in Bali). Very hard to get hot water so be prepared to settle for tepid showers. Big (15 litre) drinking water bottle cooler supplied. Staff very friendly but dont ask them to book any activities or transport for you unless you want to pay more than if you go up the street to a travel agent stall or one of the local transport guys. Swimming pool was very good, clean and big enough to swim laps, surrounded by timber decking. Sunlounges in good order and clean. Breakfasts supplied were good and they give 2 eggs. All other meals on there menu are ordered in from restuarants just up the laneway (pizzas good). Close to shops and heaps restaurants. Short bemo or taxi up to shopping centre. Laneway down to beach (100 metres) a bit rough and not lit at nighttime so watch your step. Absolutely value for money accomodation.

<Content>I still love Villa Puri Ayu! I had another three weeks at Villa Puri Ayu in a Deluxe Room from 17 April-18 May 2008. I had previously stayed there last November 2007 whilst studying in Denpasar. This time I had a holiday.The deluxe room has a comfortable king size bed, TV, Video, bar fridge, in room safe, a wash basin and bench for grooming. My room didn't have a bath but the shower stall was large and it had good water pressure. The room was spotlessly cleaned each day. The room is delightfully Balinese in it's architectecture, with its huge soaring beautifully crafted ceilings of bamboo. The roof is thatched and it's semi-detached from the other rooms. They're like a little cottage. My room was opposite the little plunge pool which was great to jump into after a day at the beach. The air conditioning worked fine and when it made a noise one time, the staff quickly fixed it for me. Also, when I mentioned that I couldn't find my watch, the staff checked the bedclothes and my watch was located. Another time I'd left my wallet on the bed and nothing had been taken. The staff remembered me from my first visit which was really nice. I think that the staff are very honest and it was pleasing to me that the same staff were still employed since my last visit. The staff were so welcoming, yet again, and remembered me from the previous visit. They are so friendly, kind and helpful. The brilliant smiles that you're greeted with at the start of each day compensate for any shortcomings that other reviewers have mentioned. The breakfast is basic but it is wholesome - (eggs - choice of poached, scrambled, omelette; a little bacon, tomatoe, 2 slices of toast, jam and butter, coffee or tea, fresh squeeze fruit juice or fruit; or nasi goreng) . Don't expect a big buffet breakfast and you won't be disappointed. It was quite busy at breakfast time when I was there and sometimes I had to wait but this was mainly due to some other guests who were ordering breakfasts for 8 in one of the villas and demanding it straight away - expecting 5 star room service. The staff were treated so rudely by these guests but the Balinese way is not to get angry and upset and Putu and Amy, the waiters, still came up all smiles. When these guests left it was easier to get breakfast.One must be mindful that this is a small, family run Balinese Hotel. Some of the staff speak a little English, French, German, Italian and so on but some of the ground staff do not speak another language but they smile. All of the 21 staff, however, do their best to please and sometimes things get lost in translation. For example, a guest insisted on a bottle of water instead of the glass of water which he was told he would be charged 3000 rupiah (about 40 cents Australian). The glass of water comes from a pure water dispenser in the kitchen, perfectly safe to drink. However, when he was given the bottle of water, he would not pay for it and spoke disrespectfully to the staff member. I felt extremely embarrassed by his behaviour - and all for 40 cents! My point is, show respect as we are visitors to the country and maybe we should try a little harder to speak the language of Indonesia and please and thankyou would be appreciated.The hotel is located on Jalan Cemera which is a public road, very narrow but it's close to the beach - a 5 minute walk at most. If you like sunbathing and swimming at the beach, I liked walking to a little beach located further away from the one advertised by the hotel. If you walk down to the beach and turn right at Donald's Restaurant, you walk along the paved footpath past the Sanur Hotel, past the Mecure Hotel, you will come to some warungs (little cafes), keep going until you reach the last warung (cafe). You can hire a sunbed and umbrella for 20000 rupiah (about $2.20 Australian) from the cafe. It's a nice little spot but get there early. I liked the food they served and you could buy your drinks- all reasonably priced. There are ladies who will give you a massage, manicure, hair braid etc on the beach. There is a huge rise and fall in the tide which simply means that the tide will ebb away depending on the time of day, and you won't be able to swim then. It's a nice spot and further on people go windsurfing, kitesurfing etc. It generally wasn't crowded. On Sundays the Balinese families come to this public beach to swim, fly their kites, ride their bikes and it's lovely to see the families having fun and enjoying the simple life.There are numerous good restaurants close to Villa Puri Ayu - just try them, all very reasonably priced. Also there's a cute little bar called the Blue Moon on Jalan Metasari (near the Mercure) - it's definitely quirky. Also if you want to buy some clothes and souvenirs, head to the Sindhu Markets on the beach at the northern end of Sanur and go to Tootsies. It's a Balinese shop but it has really good set prices. I bought a couple of wall hangings, that have some Budhist sayings that I'd priced in Australia for $150 and I paid $10-$20. They also have the knock off bags, clothes etc and some larger sizes to boot. When you get there, ask one of the local ladies where it is. They'll take you but will ask you to buy something from one of their friend's shops. You don't have to but I bought a sarong - why not? it made it easy to find the shop and it makes the people happy. It's all good fun though and you might find another shop just as good. Hardy's, in central Sanur is a good place to shop. There's a beaut supermarket that sells fresh produce and just about everything you could want. Upstairs there are retail shops with set prices that sell clothing, footwear, souvenirs etc etc and there's a bookshop. Across the road from Hardy's and to the right is Batu Jimbar, a nice coffee shop and good for people watching. Also there are free publications the Bali Advertiser and the Bali Times that give some local news and insight into the latest in Bali published every couple of weeks or so.The location of Villa Puri Ayu is down the southern end of Sanur but it's really easy to get a bemo (the local transport - a green van that's a bit rusty and clapped out looking usually (quirky again) - but so cheap - about 5000 rupiah, 50 cents to Hardy's or 10000 rupiah to Sindhu Beach) or get a bluebird taxi to Hardy's, about 10000-rupiah ($1.50). You'll have numerous offers of transport and there's definitely no shortage or hire a car or bike. Near Villa Puri Ayu there's live music down the road. Friday nights there's a rock band at the Trophy Bar or Mago's has dancing and a band. They're pretty good too. Also there's the Cat and Fiddle where you can enjoy a great meal and some live music as well. Having said that, I'm 55 and although I could hear the music on Friday night, it's all over by 12.00 midnight. I was usually reading in my room by about 10.00 - 10.30 and it didn't really disturb me although you could hear the music but it's not every night.I find the location of Villa Puri Ayu, the price, the facilities, the Balinese staff suit me and I have stayed in larger hotels in Bali that have all the bells and whistles but I like this small friendly hotel where you're made to feel welcome and are greeted and treated with respect and courtesy. Also the staff, when they are not busy, are willing to engage in conversation - like Putu at the restaurant.. Also the Balinese people at Villa Puri Ayu are still immersed in the Balinese culture and I've learnt so much. Also the people down the road remembered me from my last visit - not that I'm spectacularly interesting - but that's the Balinese people, just wonderful. The people will ask you where are you going? how long you're here? do you want massage, transport, sarong? - don't be put off - this is Bali. Also there's an excellent walking track along the beach that extends right up to northern Sanur - about 5 - 7 km - very hot to walk in the middle of the day but in the morning it's good plus there's heaps of transport to get back if it does get too hot and there are plenty of little places to buy drinks and food.So, if you're looking for a Dose of Smiles, a laid back, lazy holiday where you'll be warmly welcomed and a convenient location at a reasonable price, I can recommend Villa Puri Ayu. Go with the flow like the Balinese do, take your sense of humour, have fun and joke with the Balinese, and you'll return home less jaded and all the better for the experience.

<Content>Never again ! We travelled to Sanur with our two children ( 11 + 12 ) after staying in Ubud for three nights, I wish we had stayed there!We had the Villa Diamond and although the previous reviews rave about this Villa we thought it was terrible. Our children slept upstairs the first night, well part of it as they were kept awake by the noise from the Sanur Beach Hotel that is directly behind. The following morning my daughter woke up with insect bites all over her face, not mosquito, although she did have a few of those on her legs. The Villa is very large but old and tired. You could not cook in the kitchen as there were ants continually running all over the sideboard. It is never a good sign when there are large cans of insect killer left around the villa so you can spray. The downstairs bedroom had an ensuite bathroom that was basic and also an outside shower which unfortunately we dare not use as the stone floor tiling was so dirty and sticky. The only upside was the outside private pool and seating area that were very nice. We did ask to move after the first night and were offered an alternative smaller villa, but whilst it was a bit better it still smelt damp and was quite dark inside, we decided to stick it out.However after the second night we decided to cut our losses and fly home early, the first time we have ever had to do this. However before leaving we voiced our concerns to the manager and whilst they were very polite I doubt anything will be done. The breakfasts were OK but nothing special, the staff as always in Bali were lovely and friendly and did try to help whenever they could. There are some newer rooms that have been built on site and these do look quite nice but we did not stay in those. The main pool area is nice. The beach is close by but don't be fooled by the photos of a private beach with sun loungers. These are kept at the top of the beach practically touching the massage beds of the shop ladies selling t-shirts, sarongs etc, in fact we noticed a few of them asleep on the loungers, so we never got to use them. Unfortunately the beach at this end of Sanur is not that clean, better can be found towards the Hyatt.

<Content>Great value for money Just returned from a week at Villa Puri Ayu. The location was a bit far away from the main area of Sanur which was a bit of a shame, but all the same it was nice and peaceful for the most part. High points included:1) The room. Without fail, this was the best room I have ever had. We were staying in a 2br apartment, and it was just fantastic. So much room to move, really comfy beds, and two bathrooms - it really was fabulous.2) The pools. Both pools were fantastic - the plunge pool was quite cool, and great to jump into after lying in the sun for a while. The main pool was just beautiful, and the lounge chairs divine.3) The staff. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and you could not fault them.However, the two low points made the experience less than perfect:1) The food was terrible! We gave up having the included breakfast there after the first two days because it was inedible. Eggs were cooked in vinegar, one tiny piece of bacon and a piece of toast was it. Not to mention that regardless of what we ordered (be it lunch, dinner, breakfast or room service) the food took ages to come out and was stone cold by the time we got there...2) Construction. I believe they were doing refurbishments on the 3br villa with spa (which did look beautiful, by the way!) However, every day for the last five days of our stay there, we endured constant hammering, drilling and sawing that really impacted on our time there. I understand that the work has to be done, but if we had known that there was construction happening we would have considered staying elsewhere....All in all, it was a nice place. However I would strongly suggest if you are considering staying there to NOT get food included and to double-check if they are doing any refurbishments.

<Content>Wonderful and Peaceful Me my husband and son have just recently returned from Sanur where we stayed at the Puri Ayu. We had 7 nights in the Villa Diamond which was fantastic, (like the previous review the pictures do not do this place justice). It was so big we only went upstairs once or twice. The villa Diamond would be great for a large family getaway.We have also stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which was also really nice. The apartment was very clean and well worth the money. We had a little outside seating area which was lovely and both the bedrooms have ensuites, we also had a lovely lounge and kitchen.The accommodation is very close to heaps of restaurants and cafe's. Our favourite which just so happend to be the nearest was Mago's they have music every night, great restaurant and brilliant staff. The villas are also very close to the beach about a 2 min walk. on the beach there are lots of little market stalls and massage areas and great restaurants. We will certainly be going back again.Loved it !!!!!!!

<Content>New villa of Puri Ayu I stayes 2 nights at different villa for each. 1st night it was old type with garden, kitchen, big terrace with bar counter. It was surrounded by a wall and even you could lock the gate of your garden.2nd night I asked to stay not in the wall, but open space with the view of outside. It was new appartment villa, they called 'VILLA TONY'. The photos are all from this Tony's room. It was very new, has big open dining with the view of main pool. The living room was also big as well as sleeping room.I really appreciate that the staff listened my request. Nasi goreng at the restaurant ,which I ate in the morning, was so tasty. It would be very hard to find such Villa with the so lower price.The road which leads to the beach was dirty that was pitty. But it was on a public road, not the property of this villa. I hope they (who?) will clean and keep neatly.

<Content>Great little spot My Balinese colleagues recommended I stay at this resort during a conference in April. It was a wonderful spot for $35 a night. The staff were kind, the rooms were clean,and the grounds were beautiful. Wireless interenet (for a fee) always worked quickly, and I felt very well taken care of. I am returning to Bali in December, and will be staying at the Villa Puri Ayu again.
