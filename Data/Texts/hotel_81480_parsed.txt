<Content>Good for SF standards The Greenwich Inn is a good motel considering it is in San Francisco. It could do with a little more parking space though... Room and bathroom were very clean and the bed was comfortabel. Great shower btw! The owner was welcoming, but nothing more than that.The walls are pretty thin, so be prepared for some traffic noise during the night, especially when the fire trucks depart from the fire department right around the corner!It is located in a nice neighbourhood with lots of cosy shops, but is a pretty long walk from downtown San Francisco or Fisherman's Wharf/Pier 39. Take the car or public transportation (which is cheap!) to get there.WiFi available, but you need to ask for the password first!Overall we enjoyed our two-night-stay here.

<Content>Good location, good price, but not very clean +: The location is convenient, close to several shopping streets, felt safe.+: Free parking (limited number of places, but we had no problem), free internet, coffee machine.+: Cheap enough-: The room had a bad smell that wouldn't disappear, it wasn't very clean (I never walked bare feet on the dirty carpet), it is small and there is no place to hang the towels.+: they changed the towels and made the bed everyday.All in all, we don't spend much time in the room, so we would stay there again.

<Content>Shitty old motel The owner of the motel comes from India or Pakistan so the whole motel smells like old curry. The rooms are dirty and it is damn loud in the night because there is a fire department in the street and the firefighters alert few times a night. Don麓t go there, there are better motels in San Francisco for the same price.

<Content>No air in the room No air is the feeling you get entering the room. To be honest a mildew smell was the impression. Especially after spending the whole day around the city.It is very well located. Near the Golden Gate, Marina and North point. It's cheap but I didn't feel relaxed to sleep in that room. The cover didn't look clean. Maybe just an impression but.....So I recommend only if you don't pass many time in the room and want to spend as cheap as possible still taking advantage of the good location

<Content>Excellent location and quiet place to stay in SF! We stayed there respectively 3 and 1 nights this month and we can highly recommend this motel: kind and helpfull man who runs the motel. Clean place and above all close to all locations you want to visit, either by walking or taking a bus. One block away from the noisy Lombard street and consequently a lot quieter to sleep! We payed an average of 97 USD tax incl. per night for the first 3 nights and only 73 USD tax incl. for the last night with a coupon. Only one disadvantage: when the motel is full there is not enough parking! Anyway, we can highly recommend this affordable motel and would choose it again.

<Content>Great location in San Francisco Great location in Cow Hollow near the Marina distrtict in San Francisco close to many good restaurants and shops. Convenient deli right across the street. The internet connection was shaky and the room was small but clean. Service was not overly friendly. Very reasonable rates along with free parking. Overall, the Greenwich Inn is an excellent value for the price.

<Content>Great for the Price I was very happy with my stay at the Greenwich Inn. the staff was very friendly and helpful and my room was very clean. This is a great place to stay for the budget conscious traveller, but if you are looking for extra amenities or luxury, this is not the place for you.Pros: PRICE, location (very near the shops and restaurants on Chestnut and close to Golden Gate Bridge), friendly staff, clean rooms, FREE Parking, ample parkingCons: rooms are small, no telephone, thin walls. It is a quite neighborhood and I felt safe, but due to the thin walls you can hear the street traffic at times. If you are a light sleeper or in need of major relaxation, this could be a definite issue.

<Content>Very inexpensive place to stay in San Francisco Read the previous reviews before I booked this place so I knew what to expect. Paid only US$64 per night. I stayed 2 week nights. Towels were clean, Bedsheets were a little stained. Toilet seat was a bit old. Did not experience any bed bugs or see any cockroaches running around. Hotel wasn't secured. Anybody can come up and knock on your door or window. But I didn't experience anything throughout the 2 days. Parking was free. Parking looks limited but I managed to get a space for both nights. Free Wifi. Overall it's ok if you just need a room to bath and sleep.

<Content>Everything was OK Stayed here one Saturday night April 08. Price was $78 plus tax =$90.02. with free auto parking. Room 17, directly above the small reception office. I was expecting worse, but the room and overall experience exceed my expectations. Most of the other reviews appear to be on target. My room was very clean, no stains, bathroom very clean with no crud nor mold. Room comes with hair dryer, iron, small ironing board, small refrig, coffee maker with one pack, TV with remote, but no mircowave. I made the reservation on-line at the last moment, and this was one of the less expensive motels in this area with a vacancy. The Lombard/Cow Hollow strip has over two dozen motels/motor lodges of different age,quality and price. I did not try to contact any motel directly by phone, however I saw upon arrival in the area that many still had a vacancy sign on. The street noise was very loud in the room but dropped off later in the evening. Parking was tight and there were no empty spaces when I left in the morning. I left the car parked and traveled by bus #45 via Union street to ATT baseball park. As I am very familar with San Francisco, the location in the north section of the city is not a problem. The publicity photo of the front of the hotel does not do the property justice. It is better than it looks. The office staff was friendly and my contact minimal. You could do better but expect to pay anywhere from $30-90 more.

<Content>Liked the Greemwich Inn Stayed for two nights. The price was right and it was all we needed (pretty basic).PROS: *Bob the manager- He was incredibly helpful and hospitable. Thank you Bob! *Location- Right off Lombard, about mile from the Wharf. *Skylight in bathroom- Definitely nice to have some natural light in the bathroom. *Across the street from Mel's diner, a 24 hour restaurant. *About a block from Chestnut Street, which has tons of little shops and restaurants, and the Muni bus.CONS: *Noise- Walls are thin, garbage trucks were loud and woke me up about 3 times during the night (and I'm a heavy sleeper!) *Heater was loud. We had to keep it off just to sleep, and woke up cold. *Broken vending machine- no sign put on. *No clock in our room.All in all, the CONS were minimal and we were only in the room to sleep and shower, so this place was suitable for our needs.

<Content>Pretty nice motel We stayed at the Greenwich Inn for one night in March 2008. We were seeing a concert in Larkspur, but wanted to stay in the city. The location is very nice and seemed pretty mellow and safe. Save for some machinery noise early Sunday morning, it was a pretty quiet place to stay. Shutters on the windows were a nice touch. The room offered dimension, which a separate closet area, which prevented the feeling of staying in a box, which is common with hotels. One of the coolest amenities, which was a nice surprise, was a huge skylight in the restroom. Being a huge fan of natural light while getting ready in the morning, I loved this feature. Free/safe/ample parking is also a plus. This property actually sprawls across either side of Steiner, and one minor inconvenience is that there is only one ice machine for both buildings, and we stayed at the ice-less location and had to walk across the street at 1am just to get some ice. Also, there is no breakfast offered in the lobby (not even a muffin!), but IHOP is right around the block and San Francisco's favorite Mel's Diner is just a few steps from the motel. Nice place for the price. Will stay again.

<Content>Good Value We moved to this place from one around the corner on Lombard - a good decision! The Greenwich is one block off Lombard so lots less noisy, which is great. On-site parking is a real plus too. Two blocks from Chestnut where you can find numerous sidewalk cafes and shops. Rooms was clean and spacious, easy check-in.

<Content>Not great, but nor terrible. Room was modestly priced. I got a deal by asking for the SanFrancisco.com rate. Overall the room was adequate. Cons: - The shower door wouldn't close, - The carpet was stained. - You feel very exposed as anyone from the street could walk up and bang on your door if they wanted too. For this reason my girlfriend didn't feel very safe staying here. - Can get noisy, and neighbours closing their doors are loud in your room. Garbage trucks driving around early in the morning.- Closes at 11pm. (Note this if you will be arriving late)Pros:- Price- Location- Staff seemed friendly

<Content>Lovely place to stay Stayed here for three nights. The family who run the place (that's how it appeared anyway) were lovely and really helpful with recommending places to eat and see and the public transport.The room was a decent size (we didn't need that much space) and the bathroom was clean.It may look a bit far from the action of SF, but if you're not driving there are really good bus routes both to Fisherman's Wharf and to Castro/JapanTown. There are plenty of places to eat nearby on Union Street and in Cow's Hollow.

<Content>Staff so indifferent, they couldn't even tell me if they had a room available this was my first choice after compiling a few TripAdvisor reviews, but The Greenwich Inn was either full or just un co-operative, it was very difficult to tell as the staff were so indifferent. So ended up at the Buena Vista Motor Inn which was fine.

<Content>Good location, ok room The staff at check in were friendly, especially given the 11 hour flight, BART ride and taxi ride, and assigned us a room on the ground floor. You will have gathered i had no car at this time, preferring to explore San Francisco on foot. There was parking at the site, but it seemed to be limited. The room was a bit on the small side, and had no fridge or microwave. The bed was a little firm, but perfectly ok for a nights sleep. With the exception of the size, the only thing to really bug me in the room was the lack of light, it made it feel quite dingy, and being on the ground floor behind a stairwell made it even darker. The slats over the window were either fully open, meaning people could see in, or fully closed, meaning it felt like midnight all the time. But then how much time do you spend in your room with so much to see and do in San Francisco? The bathroom was clean and a good size, but as with most hotel showers, if, like me, you are very tall, then be prepared to limbo under the shower head to get anywhere above your nipples wet. There was some traffic noise early in the morning, around 6am, but SF rush hour, as with much of CA is earlier than the UK, and you are just a stones throw from 101. Location wise, the hotel is great, and the walk to the bay front is through nice areas of the city. There are many restaurants near by, but beware Mels Diner. Nice food, but if you don't tip 50% of the price of a burger you've order to take out then they are very rude! It's probably 20-25 mins to the wharf and ghiradelhi square, and from there SF is your Oyster. Have fun, and from what i've seen and heard of SF, this room is a real bargain given the location and general standard of room. I would recommend this hotel to someone if they weren't planning on spending too much time in it.

The location is good with lots of restaurants nearby and seemed like a pretty safe area to be in.The motel was above average and the room was clean and big enough, if not huge. The free parking is a massive bonus in San Francisco and the main reason we chose it.]Definately recommended if you are driving.

<Content>Nice location! As we went there on a walk in base, we were very pleased to be treated so wel at the front desk! The lady was very helpfull en friendly. The free parking is great, we left our car at the motel and walked to every hotspot in the area. ( because we were a little afraid to have no parkingspace as we got back; in our opinion there were not many spaces...)Our feet really hurt after a long day of walking! (but it was worth it!) Cable cars are about 15 mn. walking (and climbing!!) away to take you either to Fishermann's wharf or downtown and chinatown. The rooms are very nice, not very big but enough to stay here for a few days. Mel's Diner is very nice 50's like restaurant, just around the corner. The little convienent store around the corner is handy for your to go breakfast (bagels and croissants) and for some drinks to take to your room at night.The area can be some noisy indead but, h茅, you're staying in the middle of a big city! San Francisco is our favorit city in California, next year we will be back and, if there are rooms available, stay in this motel again!

<Content>Great Place We stayed in Greenwich for 4 days on 2nd floor room. It has beautiful skylight in the bathroom, It has coffee maker and the beds are really comfortable. Bob, manager is really a great person he was so helpful and always smiling. Mels drive in is around the corner, Ihop is open 24 hrs around the corner. It is close to more than 40 great shops and restaurants.. when I say 40 I mean it ! The best part is - its not on lombard st, people often complaint about the noise of it being on highway 101. It is one block away from lombard may be 25 feet away. Worth a stay !!! when you are in good place with good people - it is always a feel good factor and it's a trip you always remember.

<Content>Nice but Noisy We stayed for about a week at the hotel which was absolutely perfect for our needs. The room was nice, large and clean with coffee machine and a powerful shower which is always nice. The location is fantastic, it's in the area called Cow Hollow which is really trendy, loads of shops, restaurants and bars within 5 mins walk and it feels very safe at night. The public transport could be better. The number 30 bus runs from two blocks up to downtown but it is horribly infrequent so we had to get taxis a lot or just walk as the hotel is close to all the marina/fishermans wharf attractions.My one problem was the noise. We had a room which backed onto the street and the fire engines/ ambulances/ trucks and general noise woke us up several times. I appreciate there is nothing the hotel can do about this but there was the additional problem of the cleaners and the owner shouting to each other early in the morning. This woke us up very early on a number of occassions and really shouldn't happen. If you are a heavy sleeper then it doesn't matter but if you aren't then bring earplugs!

<Content>Cozy hotel Room was small and appeared old but was very clean. The location was near a great variety of restraunts. Mel's dinner one block away was great and had lots of atmosphere. The man at the front desk could not have been any nicer, He was so helpful with restraunts and directions. I would stay there again to sightsee because it is a great price in this town. We walked to Fisherman's wharf and it took 45 minutes, nice cool breeze though and saved $25 for parking down there.

<Content>Greenwich Inn -- Simple, clean, friendly staff, great price 4 of us stayed at the Greenwich Inn for 5 nights May 31 thru June 4, 2006 for under $500. The two double-bedded rooms are located on the first floor front, across the street from the office. The hotel rooms are divided by a street. Rooms were small and clean but the price couldn't be beat. No a/c, but we slept comfortably with our window open. Always hot water for the shower. No amenities but remember this IS a budget hotel. It is an old motor lodge style hotel with parking available right in front of your door. A bit of a pine sol smell when you first open the door but it dissipates quickly. Management was wonderful, very friendly and helpful, let us store our luggage (the large, heavy bags) in the office lobby our last day as we had a late night flight. They kept our smaller, easy to grab and run bags behind the counter. Be warned that it is in a very noisy section of town, located between busy-at-all-times-of-the-day-and-night Lombard St with lots of clubs the other direction. A firestation is located around the corner within steps of the hotel, and receives calls all times of the night, so bring your earplugs! Plenty of restaurants within two blocks. City bus routes within two blocks either direction. 6-8 blocks from Fort Mason Center and the Marina. A mile or more, over hills, to Fisherman's Wharf, so unless you are in really good shape and love to walk, take the 30 Stockton bus to Fisherman's Wharf, you'll be there in about 10 minutes. Great place to stay if all you need is a warm shower and clean place to sleep. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Above the price, reasonable and nice neighborhood We stayed 5 nights in Sep.05, and were satisfied very much.It was CLEAN by Japanese standard. It is very simple but we prefer price over amenity. Hot water in the shower room runs fine, and no moldy smell, the bed is firm enough, and clean sheets every day, the towels smelled fresh. Bring a Hair Dryer since they don't have one. It is in only 2 blocks away from CHESTNUT ST where they have a lot of restaurants and shops, such as GAP. Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, Walgreens, and Safeway. Walk distance to Pacific Heights, Presidio, Marina Green. Very safe neighborhood.There were a lot other Motels in the neighborhood but this one is off from the heavy traffic Lombard St. (101). For us, who did not have a car, the bus #30 and also #22 Fillmore is close.

<Content>Clean and simple Stayed there on 18/19 September 2004. Rooms are simple but clean. Area has good selection of restaurants and bars and an especially good cafe for breakfast, Home Plate on Lombard opposite the Ihop. It is noisey due to traffic and poor insulation, but was good location for travelling around. Fishermans Wharf is about 15 minutes walk and the no. 30 MUNI can be caught on Chestnut.
