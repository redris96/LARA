<Content>Charm and Comfort Two of us shared a room at the Benivieni in early December 2008. The location is very central and convenient for all of the historic and artistic attractions. It is only one block from the Duomo. The hotel is on a relatively quiet side street and most rooms seem to face the back so there is very little noise other than church bells, which are charming and stop at night. The hotel is family run and they are extremely helpful. We would describe to them what we were craving for diner and get an excellent recommendation and reservation each night for inexpensive and very good Tuscan food. The hotel common areas and rooms are immaculate. The rooms and bathrooms are very nicely furnished, again everything looks new. It is a very old palace, but it looked as though the restoration was just finished. We highly recommend this hotel, and also suggest that December is a good time to visit Florence. The weather was cold, but there were lots of Christmas festivities happening. We were also able to enter and enjoy the museums with no lines or crowds, and the same was true about most restaurants.

<Content>Excellent place to stay We enjoyed our stay here very much. We both had singe rooms and paid accordingly. The hotel is a couple of streets away from the Duomo but is very quiet. The rooms are straighforward but comfortable and the public spaces are stylish. The breakfast (included) was ample though the standing filter coffee could have been better. Other types of coffee were on offer though. The chief attraction apart from the location was the staff, all of whom spoke good English and the two 'leading ladies' were a delight. They booked us at a couple of excellent places to eat too. We walked there from the railway station but it was a bit far if you've got luggage. I'd certainly go back there.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Location,  We walked in after a long, difficult trip  the owners welcomed us. We booked a room  wished we could have been here for our entire trip. This is the BEST place to stay! Our European trip ended well because we stayed with wonderful people in a Beautiful, immaculate Hotel. The breakfast was also lovely. The location was ideal, right in the heart of the best shopping  dining area of Florence. We hope we can return to stay here in the future.

<Content>Lovely hotel in an unbeatable location This is a lovely hotel in a great location. The rooms are spacious and clean. The people who own it are just wonderful and all the staff is helpful and very friendly. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice well located hotel in Florence. With the added benefit of having the best gelato in Florence almost next door.

<Content>Clean but starkly furnished Stayed here for 2 nights in mid-May.Hotel is new and clean. Relatively sparsely furnished. Beds are not all that comfortable: they are cots on a wood frame. Less supportive than a futon.Breakfast was just ok. A little street noise, but generally quite.Reception and owners were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>A total disaster of a hotel experience If you are looking for a skimpy breakfast, 20 square tub-less micro shower in a windowless bath, mini towels that remove layers of skin, unusually low and frail bedframes with concave mattresses, flat unyielding pillows, and cheerless room decor along with a disorganized and creepy staff, this is the place for you. After our bed collapsed three times and being accused of juming up and down on it- absurd for a 61 year old- tossing the broken and unrepaired bedframe in the hall and sleeping on the floor the last night, we fled to the nearest 4 star for relief. Even with our complaints and 48 hour cancellation notice the hotel refused to return the 500.00 Euro they owed us! They were snotty and rude. We are well traveled, seen it all, and this was an unmitigated nightmare.

<Content>Excellent location and a warm greeting Hotel Benivieni is a great base to explore Florence. It really is amazing how you can be amidst the crowds around the Duomo and in a minute escape down a quiet side street and experience some peace and quiet. The hotel is historic and pleasant; the desk staff is very warm and welcoming. Rooms are fine, but the beds are a bit uncomfortable; I do find that this is frequently a problem in Europe. The bathroom is microscopic and a big guy has a problem even fitting in the shower, which seems to be designed for children. Breakfast is very nice, among the best I've had in Europe, but the same every day, and we spent a total of eight nights there. The server was gruff and didn't speak English, but after a few days we got her to smile and she would bring us better coffee than the awful Nescafe that they love to foist on Americans in Europe. We have not stayed in other hotels in Florence so I cannot compare this with others, but it certainly was a good value, especially since we got the off-season rate just before the high season started. We probably would now stay for fewer days in Florence and more in other parts of Tuscany, but if you do plan to spend time there the Benivieni is a very good base.

<Content>Beautiful, Friendly Hotel Benivieni Loved this place! It made our stay in Florence comfortable, relaxing and memorable. Located within a stones throw of the Duomo (Santa Maria del Fiore), the rooms are beautiful, including new bathroom fixtures, floors. What made the stay even more enjoyable was the friendliness of the owners and their staff, who were all related. Enis (owner) is as nice as they come. She speaks very good English and has a great sense of humor. She also provides good restaurant and shopping recommendations.Enjoy your stay.

<Content>Does what it says on the tin As i said the Hotel does what it says on the tin. The rooms are a good size and reasonably comfortable,likewise the bathroom. The room could certainly benefit from a fridge to keep drinks cool. That said we did test out the room service and they do have delicious icy cold Heineken at the press of a button.The staff were all great, very friendly and helpful with good suggestions for restauants.All in all a great little hotel in a great location near all the important sights.

<Content>Nice for the price The hotel is nice and great for the price. The location is great you are right around the corner from the Duomo and short walking distances from everything else. It was missing some of the amenities that we had in some of our other rooms in Italy such as a mini bar, they said they would bring anything to us which we never did try but it is nice to put a bottle of water in a fridge to get it cold. The only clock in the room was on the TV and I could not figure out how to keep it illuminated at night, this happened in another hotel during our stay in Italy, a clock in a room is always a nice thing to have. So I guess if those are my biggest complaints than it cannot be that bad. Breakfast was pretty standard for what we found with other hotels in Italy. Room was a good size and bathroom again about the same as others we saw in Italy. Two other things about this hotel first they do not like others than the registered guests going up to the rooms. Had my cousins staying at another hotel and they wanted to see the room. This caused a bit of a scene and ended with my cousin and his wife waiting for us in the lobby. Also there is a church behind the hotel and the bells can start early in the morning we had one morning they went off at about 7:30 am. We stayed in RM 202 which I think was on the back of the hotel and on Saturday nights you can hear the bar down stairs. All this being said for the money still really good value. Perfect for families I think. Ciao. I do have pics but to big to load so if you would like me to forward will however the pics on this site already are as good or better than the ones I have. Have a great trip!

<Content>The perfect little hotel. Look no further! Two fussy couples traveled to Italy this May. We all agreed that this little hotel was the greatest surprise of our time in Italy. It is bright and clean, clean, clean. The rooms are lovely and feel quite large (for Italy). The building has been lovingly restored, the corridors are wide and well lit, the old staircase is beautiful and the public spaces are very comfortable and pretty. The breakfast sandwiches were perfect to start the day, the location is perfect, very close to the Duomo, also close to the Uffizi. But do mind the comments about driving....the streets are so narrow our taxi driver had to back up in order to maneuver around a tight corner.The small staff is very pleasant and helpful. The pictures of the hotel do not do it justice. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>One of our Favorites in Europe This is a gem of a hotel about a block from the Duomo and central to everything. The rooms are large by european standards, and being on a quiet street means a good night's sleep - important when you are walking all day.The staff is excellent. We were there for the second time in 3 years, and when we arrived it felt like we were coming home! Count on Sonja to have good restaurant recommendations.Nearby are stores for wine, cheese and so on, so if you just want to make up your own lunch and find a favorite spot in Florence to sit, it is easy to do.One thing to keep in mind - if you are driving into Florence, this hotel is in a pedestrian area, which you have to drive into to get to the Hotel. So get specific instructions from the Hotel before you arrive as to how to get to them. The extra effort will be well worth it, however.

<Content>Great Find! Loved this hotel! Don't Pass this One Up! Hotel Benivieni in Florence went above and beyond my expectations!The LOCATION was ideal! It is literally right around the corner from DUOMO, which is where you absolutely want to be. I booked this hotel because I took my parents to Florence and my father has bad feet, so I needed to have a great location, very close to all attractions. Well, you couldn't get any better than Hotel Benivieni! It's RIGHT NEXT TO, easy walking distance, to all the attractions, yet on a quiet, cobblestone sidestreet. There are great restaurants next door and down the street. There's also a great convenience store down the block with a great selection of Italian cookies and reasonably priced iced teas and sodas for you to bring to your room after a day of sight-seeing, which was nice. However, there are no refrigerators in the room, so don't stock up.We were welcomed as family there at reception- very great, warm service at this hotel. It was also VERY CLEAN and tastefully decorated with Old World charm. You can tell that this hotel was recently renovated. The bathrooms were spotless as well. The breakfast was nice - similar to a Continental breakfast (cereal, rolls, pastries, yogurts, mini-sandwiches, coffee, tea), but no bacon/scrambled eggs/sausage or American-type breakfast. However, this was fine with me personally, It hit the spot and the quiet, cozy dining room was a perfect way to start the day.What stands out with Hotel Benivieni was that its GREAT LOCATION, WARM HOSPITALITY, and CLEAN, COMFORTABLE ROOMS. Really, what more can you ask for?Advice: If you could get tickets online for Uffizzi Gallery before the trip it would save you hours in line!Any other questions, my email is jerseybrit06@yahoo.co.ukARRIVEDERCI!

<Content>Terrific hotel! Lovely, quiet hotel on a charming side street 1 block from the Duomo. Clean, spacious rooms, excellent plumbing and A/C. Modern facility with old world ambience. Gracious and helpful staff - especially Sonja. Walking distance (5-15 minutes) to most of the major sights in Florence, lots of shopping and a small grocery store just around the corner. Nice breakfast each day, free internet for guests, and helpful recommendations for restaurants and tours. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Florence!!

<Content>Hotel Benivieni is va bene! Hotel Benivieni is a wonderful accomodation in Florence, close to the duomo, and to a lively main piazza (but not too close), plus within easy walking distance of the Ufizzi, the Arno bridge, the walkway to the copy of David located on a rise which overlooks the town of Florence and provides an excellent view, plus within walking distance to the Academy which houses the original David. I had actually already booked another accomodation in Florence through a travel agent and had paid in full, but heard that particular pension did not suit a traveler friend of mine's needs. Based on their personal review, I cancelled my reservation (at a financial cost) and booked instead at Hotel Benivieni, which was recommended to me by a friend at work who had stayed there in the summer of 06 with her daughter.I stayed at Hotel Benivieni with my college daughter for three nights just recently and we both loved our entire experience. The interior is very elegant in a simple and lovely style. Also, the breakfast was an anomoly in Italy, and a great satisfaction to us as Americans. Normally, Italian breakfasts seem to consist of coffee and pastry. Not at Hotel Benivieni. I am a small person and don't require much in the way of calories, however, at Hotel Benivieni, I helped myself to a bowl of rice crispies, a yogurt, a small chocolate croissant, two diminutive sandwiches of an egg salad type with tomatoe and lettuce that were so very delicious, plus tea and oranje juice and a piece of fruit each morning. All this was available from 7 am until 10 am and it suited my schedule very well. Also, it proved very wise to have a nice breakfast due to all the walking my daughter and I chose to do in order to explore Florence. The other very welcome trait about Hotel Benivieni was the staff. They were extremely helpful and more than happy to speak English, a big change from some of the other hotel experiences I had while traveling through various areas of Italy.This hotel is extremely modern but with an old world style and very aesthetically pleasing. Nice wood floors, pretty decor, wonderful bath with excellent plumbing, TV in room, plus a menu available 24 hours, and the most delightful staff who were always available to help with directions or suggestions and an excellent little restaurant immediately next door. Additionally, there is a nice loaner library in the reception area with guidebooks for Florence and surrounding areas as well as novels to read (in English). I noticed the internet was available at a small station off the lobby if you needed to access it within the hotel. I am not sure if they have wireless service as I didn't have a laptop or need of wireless. Check with the hotel if you need that type of service. I would stay at Hotel Benivieni again if I ever have the chance to return to Florence. It was the best accomodation I had while in Italy for a two week visit. The price was very reasonable at 180 euros per night for two people and full breakfast included.Just for reference, I went to look at the other accomodation I had originally booked to compare and there was no comparison. I was so grateful I had booked with Hotel Benivieni and not the other place! You will be very satisfied too, I am sure. Enjoy your stay!

The room and bathroom have an old world charm but are immaculately clean. The bathroom was the nicest that I had seen in our travels through Italy. It is modern. Breakfast is very good. Best of all, you are right down the street from the Duomo and are close to all historic sites. I would definitely return to this hotel and I highly recommend it.

<Content>Great hotel and found a great store for the ladies nearby My wife and I stayed at this charming hotel in Mid July of this year and we had a great time. The hotel is clean and the staff are very helpful. Breakfast was small but very good and the person was very helpful.The hotel is very close to all tourist attractions and everyone is helpful if you have questions. Cost was reasonable and we would definitely stay there again. The rooms are airconditioned which really was comfortable during the hot Florence summer.There is an excellent restaurant not far away il Latini in which the food is great and the ambiance fantastic. The price was very reasonable. Reservatons are a must.Now for the surprise for the ladies. Not far from the hotel, around the corner is a store which sells leather goods, purses and handbags. The store is called Dantesca and is run by a bubbly young lady, Yael, from England and her husband, Marco. They are very accomodating. The store is right across from the Casa de Dante and is the only store on the street. The street is a narrow laneway so you will have to search for it. But ask at the hotel and they can point you in the right direction.The store is a little chaotic as they also manufacture leather goods. My wife found a big selection of models and colours. The purses are all leather and the prices much lower than the m ajor stores. It is a small store, has a large selection and lots of charm.

<Content>Even better than advertised This little gem of a hotel has gotten some great reviews on this site. We stayed there for three days and it was even better than advertised. First, a great location, just a block south of the Duomo on a quiet street away from the crowds. Second, a great staff. Sonia and her family helped with everything, including getting a doctor to examine our sick son in his room within a half hour of our arrival. Try getting that kind of service in the USA! They also made great recommendations on restaurants and shopping. Third, the hotel itself is simply charming. Nicely appointed rooms, good showers, and breakfast in a quaint room off the lobby. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip to Florence.

<Content>Great Location and Neat as a Pin A traveling companion and I stayed at the Benivieni for two nights in September. The location is in the center of the action, yet its unassuming side-street location means it is completely quiet and peaceful. The rooms are small, but they sparkle, and the facility has been beautifully updated, including state-of-the-art bathrooms. The hotel owners love Americans and could not be more pleasant or helpful. Their English is excellent. The property has only 14 guest rooms, which lends to its intimate feel.

<Content>Great Location We stayed here for 4 nights in mid-September. The staff was very friendly. The location was great and central to the main sites. The room was a bit smallish, but clean. The bathroom was very clean. The shower stall leaked and was small, but manageable. The bed was okay, but the pillows were flat and hard. The windows did not have soundproofing and even though the hotel was on a small side street, there were loud noises from the street during the evening until midnight (e.g. vespas, bottles clanging from the restaurant below, people talking). The breakfast buffet was good and included mini sandwiches, cereal, yogurt, boiled eggs, breads, and pastries.

The location is excellent with the fine restaurants and all of Firenze's star attractions a short walk away. Walking past the Duomo everyday on our way to and from the hotel is breathtaking.The staff is excellent and the hotel is very clean. Breakfast was nice too. Try to reserve a room away from the street if you like to go to bed early. There is a modest amount of noise until about midnight. This was not a problem for us as we routinely turned in later.
