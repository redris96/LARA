<Content>Lots of hidden charges We found this hotel through the Frankfurt Airport's webpage. At only 鈧?8 a night quoted on the webpage, we thought that we were getting quite a good deal. Well, we were mistaken. They said on their page they offer a Free airport shuttle. Well, the shuttle is free, but ONLY when you travel from the airport to their hotel. If you want to leave their hotel and catch a ride on the bus back to the Airport, it is 鈧? a person. This was not mentioned on the original booking page. So their free airport shuttle is NOT free. Their hotel restaurant's average price is between 鈧?5 to 鈧?0 a person (just for the main course) and a standard size coke from the vending machine is 鈧?. They have a mini-bar in the room, but the prices are not any cheaper. The is absolutely nothing else in the area surrounding the hotel, so there is nothing you can walk to. If you want to get back to the airport to find cheaper food you have to pay the 鈧?/person bus fee to get back. When we checked in, we were asked if we would like breakfast, and we said sure, because the front desk lady said nothing about it costing anything, so we said ok. Well, sometimes accidents happen while on vacation, and you don't always wake up when you would like to, so we were unable to get breakfast as we had expected. We went to check out and that's when we found out that our hotel bill was not the 鈧?8 quoted online, but 鈧?13!!!! YES you read that right, they charge you 鈧?5 for breakfast for 2 people. We tried to tell the lady that we had not had a chance to get the breakfast because we were running late, and had to make it to the airport. However, she was unapologetic, unsympathetic, and unwilling to get rid of the charge for us (this was the only hotel I've ever been to that would not do anything to help their guests). The front desk person, told us that it had already been added to the bill and the could not take it off regardless if we had asked for the breakfast or not. We had to leave to make our flight so we were unable to stay there and argue it out. So I'm out 鈧?5 (approx. ~ $45USD), and have no recourse against them. So be warned when you stay here it may not be the bargain that it appears online. I guess their system is ok for those people who are business travelers and the company picks up the tab. However, it's not an acceptable system to me because I'm out an extra 鈧?5 for nothing. I was unhappy with the hotels staff unwillingness to help someone out. I travel through Frankfurt quite frequently and I can definitely say that I will never be staying at this hotel ever again. I cannot recommend this hotel after the way I was treated.

<Content>A good overnight stay at Frankfurt airport This was my second stay at this hotel (previous time was few years back).The hotel was renovated since my last stay but it is by no means luxurious or a vacation resort.As an airport hotel for a quick stay between flights it gives you exactly what you would expect. Clean room, air conditioning, good breakfast and a friendly front desk staff that speaks English.The shuttle to the airport runs every 30 minutes which is not great. Waiting outside the airport for 30 minutes could be unpleasant.The water current at the shower was poor (although hot).Overall, very functional and reasonable value for an overnight at the airport.

<Content>If you aren't particular My husband and I stayed in this hotel for one night only because our flight was early the next morning.We arrived just around check in time and as it was a warm and humid day we asked if the room would have air conditioning. We had read the other reviews here.The room we had ordered (airport view) apparently didn't because the room they send us to was viewing nothing but the hotel back yard. No mention at check in though.Since I had to while away a few hours on my own when my husband dropped our car off with his parents I would really have liked to watch the planes.Also, the room charge was higher because of air conditioning.But, that was the least problem.We had tons of luggage as we were going away for over 3 weeks and there was no luggage cart visible and no help was offered to us. Still, they put us in the room furthest away from the elevator.When I looked around the room, I noticed the window was cracked. There was no draft, but this still was not so great. The air conditioner worked, but was so noisy we had to turn it off at night. Seeing I could not see planes I decided to watch some TV. Nothing. Just grey. I checked the TV and the cable tv cord had been unplugged. So I had to move that TV around a lot to insert the cord. The blankets provided were really, really thick and we were really hot in those beds over night. The toilet flush had to be pressed down hard otherwise it didn't flush alright.The shower was broken also. When I stepped in only a lame little water trickle left the shower head so I changed the shower head to the stronger shower, but the water just leaked out of the back sides of the shower head, with no more strength than the other. The window curtain had a big rip in it. With all those negatives, there were also a few nice things: the one comfy chair was really comfy. The beds were pretty comfortable also. They provided a hair and body shampoo in squeezable containers in the shower and near the sink. I think that is quite good for the environment, but if you didn't bring your own lotion you will have none. No shower cap either.We could check our luggage in at night so I was on my own with 3 suitcases. Again, no help. The lady at the front desk asked if I went again the next morning and let me ride the airport bus shuttle for free that night.When we checked out next morning and complained about all those things we still had to pay for the airport shuttle. (5 Euros per person). With so many problems that should have been the least they could have given us. We never tried their big breakfast, but tea and coffee with croissants and Nutella and jam and butter was quite enough, especially as you get a lot of food on your flight usually.Next time we are flying out early we will try another hotel in the area, especially as there are a few you can walk to from the terminal instead of paying extra money for a shuttle bus.

<Content>Clean, Comfortable, Consistant In my travels through FRA I have used this hotel often as a place to stay over before a morning flight home. Its clean, comfortable, and the rates are very good. They also provide a free shuttle from the terminals which makes it nice and easy.Both the on-site restaurant, and the JU-52 bar are both worth checking out!

<Content>Don't even think about it, even being desperate Staff not customer-orientated at all. Central air-conditioning broke down and spare parts not available till at least one week later. We were not informed when checked in. Given a room on the ground floor with windows open to the pedestrian walk, meaning that one could not keep it open. Staff not helpful at all. Not apologetic. No electric fans when the temperature was 31 degree celcius. Finally changed our room to a higher floor, but needed us to pull our bags to the reception first and then going back to the lift lobby again. Staff showed unwillingness to make the change. Rude. A shame to the hotel service profession!

<Content>Just OK Used the hotel for an overnight before a flight home. Definitely don't think it qualifies as a 4 star property as I have seen advertised. It would be more accurate to describe it as a basic accommodation and it's appeal is the convenience of it's location to the airport. The room was ok overall however we did end up moving from our first room as it did not have any air conditioning, which was something that was sorely needed as it was quite hot in the region at the time of our stay. Was charged extra for the second room because of it's a/c but do think that all the rooms should automatically have this feature included in the rate. The restaurant was ok and they did offer a fairly good dinner and breakfast buffet. The room kind of reminded me of a large cafeteria though, so definitely short on atmosphere.Also think the airport shuttle should be included in the rate as well.

<Content>Good Airport Hotel The hotel is a very good airport hotel. Quiet, clean, functional. The only weakness is that I would recommend that you take a taxi rather than wait for the shuttle. The free shuttle from airport to hotel was packed and as a result it meant that the check in was extremely congested when everyone arrived at once.Also as pointed out you pay for the return shuttle so not really a free shuttle after all.Our experience was that the staff were great - efficient, friendly. The little bar in the hotel provided us with a little snack late at night and a great drink.I spent a great deal of time trying to find a good hotel at Frankfurt Airport that didn't cost too much or was too far from the airport. This is the spot you should stay if you are staying overnight - it was a great sleep before a long transatlantic flight.

<Content>Very bad location My husband I stayed at the hotel April 21-24, 2008. We booked it because they have free shuttle to the airport and a free pass for public transportation and we thought it woiuld not be a problem getting to town. We were wrong. The shuttle runs every 30 minutes and is not timed to work with the S Bahn to the Hauptbahnhof. It usualy has just left when you get to the pick up point and you wait for 25 minutes for the next one. The bus usually leaves a few minues early from the first pickup at the airport and does not wait for the guests. It leaves the hotel late, and you miss the train at the airport. check in is slow since the guest arrive all at once on the bus. The shuttle is no longer free, but since we booked before the change we got free tokens. The room is very basic, but clean and it is quiet. Breakfast was included and very good, there is no other place to eat but their restaurant and it takes about an hour to get downtown.

<Content>Poor, unjust reception service. Very rude personnel. I checked into the InterCityHotel Frankfurt Airport at 23.00 on 8th of may to spend one night and leave early the next day. I checked out at 7 in the morning and asked the person at the reception to leave keep the room key for me in case i decide to return. I came to the airport to meet my mother whose flight into Frankfurt was scheduled at 8 a.m. However, I found out that her plane came in 1 hour earlier and my mother went to the hotel to meet me there. I found out later that when my mother was trying to ask the hotel personnel at the reception to look for me they gave her the hardest time, screamed at her and threatened to kick her out of the hotel (one of the managers on duty started calling for police and started swearing at her in German). They did not even allow her to stay at the reception and wait for my return to the hotel. As I saw my mother several minutes later I was shocked to hear about the whole story. I called the hotel and asked the manager on duty for explanation - I was even more shocked when i heard the same person screaming at my mother scream at me and give me the hardest time as well.Unfortunately, I did not find the names of the people who were on duty at the reception on 9th of may (it was a man (manager) and a woman).So, as to my intentions to stay at the same hotel again - I made myself a promise never to stay InterCityHotel Frankfurt Airport.

<Content>Nice, clean, friendly My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for one night before our flight to the USA. We had a bedroom with two single beds; there was a small, very functional bathroom, a dresser, space to hang clothes, a refrigerator, TV, a small table and comfortable chairs. The room is not big but it worked well for us; it was clean and the beds comfortable. Internet access is available for a small fee. Very nice staff at reception and in the restaurant. We loved the breakfast buffet. Great choices. The shuttle service to the airport worked well. We can recommed it!

<Content>Clean and Quiet Stayed at the InterCity two different dates in April 2008 and I agree with the general ratings for this Hotel. However, be aware that apparently after February 1, 2008, the Hotel Schuttle is free only from the airport. To return to the airport the fee is 5 Euro per person. Some female clerks will give the green token which is a free pass. But the red token will cost 5 Euro. GO FOR THE GREEN. Don from Sioux City, IA

<Content>'Old Faithful' doesn't let you down My comments are based on having stayed here 6 times.This is not a honeymoon resort. It's a functional airport hotel, but an excellent one.The rooms are roughly what you would get at a US Best Western, but with a soft bed. They are very well sound proofed from airport noise, and you can sleep well. However, sensitive sleepers should watch out for rooms on the back side, which faces a busy freeway.The charmingly named Fluggi restaurant has a good buffet at dinner (a la carte also available) and an excellent breakfast buffet including very good coffee.The staff is always quick and friendly, and they tolerate Americans.In addition to the above, the front side of the hotel which faces the airport has a very nice small parklike area with large mature trees. This creates a restful atmosphere around the front and at the bar which faces the front.Internet charge is 10 Euros for 5 hours and shuttle to the airport (every 30 mins.) charges 5, but these are acceptable given the reasonable room charges at Old Faithful.Unfortunately, there's no path connecting the hotel to nearby walking paths in the woods. Despite that, I would stay here again.

<Content>No Frills Large airport transit hotel in a desolate location near only highways and cargo facilities. The room itself was large, with lots of space to put luggage and spread out. Since most guests are only there to sleep, it is probably a good bargain compared to the international chains that charge twice as much.But my non-smoking room smelled of smoke. The every half hour shuttle to the airport was 20 minutes late. There is an (elevated) extra charge for everything -- fitness center costs 8 Euros; breakfast is 17 E. One Euro buys 2 whole minutes of internet access. There was no way to charge my cell phone since neither I nor the hotel had an adapter. The restaurant has limited hours. The organization that invited me made arrangements, they thought, for the bill to be sent to them, but the front desk insisted on charging me anyway. The lobby is small and without any character. One plus is that the place is environmentally aware -- sod on the roof for insulation, all long-life bulbs. No fatal flaws, but the relatively low rate may be deceiving, if you use any of the facilities or expect the hotel to merit its 4-star rating.

<Content>Convenient Airport Hotel A good airport hotel, immaculate clean rooms, reasonable rates, friendly staff. Bar is open late...no complaints. My preferred place when I have to stay at Frankfurt airport, since it offers free shuttle rides from and to the airport.There is cheaper airport hotels in the area. I once stayed in one of those. It was far inferior quality compared to the InterCity Hotel, and what I saved on the room, I had to spend for a Taxi to get there from the airport and back.

<Content>"Good Location to Airport - Served its purpose: one-night stay, near airport" The Intercity Hotel is located right near the airport property in a suburb known as Cargo City Sud (South). The area is aptly named since there is literally nothing else around the hotel except warehouses full of cargo waiting to come into the city or go out of the airport. The Intercity Frankfurt Airport Hotel, which makes it a perfect choice for a night's stay before a early morning flight. My husband and I stayed at this hotel the night before we leave Frankfurt to Malaysia. This seemed to be a good spot prior to leaving on early flight.This hotel is part of the Steinberger chain of hotels. But note that there is another hotel, called Steinberger Hotel Airport. Do not confuse the two and take the wrong shuttle bus. Which, we did. Oops! The bus driver was kind enough to send us back to Terminal 2 to wait for the correct shuttle bus again.The hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from each airport terminal, every half hour. This is on a full-size city bus, and it is heavily utilized. But for our needs, traveling via free shuttle from/to the airport was easy enough. If in the future I were in need of an airport hotel for a one-night stay, I would consider this one. The shuttle bus is very spacious and it's very convenient to carry our baggage and stroller in the bus no doubt the bus do not have luggage storage compartment. It is also very friendly towards handicapped passengers (especially those on wheelchair).Our rate was USD105 (twin double) 鈥?(booked from otel.com), included a wonderful buffet breakfast and free shuttle to/from the airport I seriously doubt that you can find any other rooms at this price so close to the airport, especially if you just need a place to sleep before a morning flight, this hotel is hard to beat.The hotel d茅cor are modern, clean, and simple. We checked into a room with a twin bed. We find the rooms fairly spacious, clean and comfortable but some might find the bathrooms a bit tiny even by European standards, and contained a shower with no tub. No bar soap or shampoo was provided. Instead, liquid dispensers containing body wash were installed in the shower and next to the sink.Strangely enough, the bed slept well and was comfortable. Items in the mini-bar were reasonably priced and TV has English channels. Staff was professional and courteous. Queues for reception always seemed to be a bit long but the staffs were helpful and friendly. The service is ok and English is spoken by all.The restaurant (The Fluggi) had a decent buffet at each mealtime, and the food was good. Breakfast buffet is extensive and of a high quality. Excellent! There was a variety of fruits, yogurts, pastries, eggs, bacon and sausages with plenty of tea and coffee (expresso machine) to go around. The buffet dinner (forgotten how much we paid for) were fine but not memorable. The pub (Ju 52) was quaint and stocked with plenty of good beer and spirits.There is Internet in the lobby at an outrageous two Euros per minute. This is a good airport hotel, especially if you are looking for something close to the airport, but don't want to spend a fortune, this is a good choice. It is quite basic, but it beats the alternative of having to try and rush to the airport from other areas in the morning! Overall, this would be an okay hotel to stay for one night if you had a long layover or wanted to rest before a long flight. An excellent value - highly recommended!Be advised鈥?there is NOTHING to do near the hotel. You would need to go to the airport, then take the train into town for activities. This might not be such a good choice for business travelers staying several nights. Alternatively, since there is a train station right in the Frankfurt airport, using a non-airport hotel should also be considered; getting to such a hotel might not take any longer than traveling by shuttle to the InterCity Airport Hotel. Not recommended if you are looking for room service, etc.

<Content>Served its purpose: one-night stay, near airport Like the previous poster, we stayed here for one night, courtesy of Lufthansa. On that Sunday night there seemed to be so many distressed passengers we wondered if the hotel would have any business at all if the flights operated on time :-)The room was good-sized, but with a small bathroom. Beds were comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, it reminded me of a lower mid-market U.S. hotel, such as Holiday Inn. Nothing fancy, but adequate nonetheless. Dinner and breakfast buffet meals were fine but not memorable. It's not as if there were other options in the area. The hotel's location is quite remote and I can certainly understand why some earlier posters traveling by auto had difficulty finding this property. But for our needs, traveling via free shuttle from/to the airport was easy enough. As noted by others, the shuttle can be very crowded during peak times. If in the future I were in need of an airport hotel for a one-night stay, I would consider this one. This might not be such a good choice for business travelers staying several nights. Alternatively, since there is a train station right in the FRA airport, using a non-airport hotel should also be considered; getting to such a hotel might not take any longer than traveling by shuttle to the InterCity Airport Hotel.

<Content>Comfortable no-frills airport hotel I stayed here one night, courtesy of Lufthansa, as a result of some flight connection problems (I was not the only one !!). My stay was therefore just a few hours. This is a comfortable, and modern no-frills hotel, very close to the airport with half-hourly shuttle services. The shuttles were pretty full. The hotel was soundproof, and the room was perfectly comfortable, with modern decor. The buffet meal was perfectly adequate, and the breakfast was good. All in all this was a perfectly acceptable and very convenient hotel for a short overnight airport stay .

<Content>Great airport location The Intercity Hotel is located right next to the airport, which makes it a perfect choice for a night's stay before a morning flight, as we had. It's a bit hard to find - the Web site is hard to navigate - and watch out that you don't accidentally end up at the other Intercity Hotel in downtown Frankfurt. We did - oops! The accommodations are modern, clean, and simple. The major drawbacks were very high parking fees (12 euro for one night, ouch!), no breakfast included, and one of the highest nightly rates of our trip. Of course, we were in Bavaria most of the time, where things are cheaper. This is a basic and simple place to stay for an overnight before a flight - it lacks the personal charm that I value in small BB's, which we normally choose.

<Content>Very handy with some pluses as well My wife and I spend two months every year in Europe and find that this hotel is an excellent place to lay your head prior to flying home the next day. The rack rate is very high but there are all kinds of discounts which can bring the cost significantly down. Peruse their Internet site carefully for these. Our rate was 99 Euros (age 65+, double) but included a wonderful buffet breakfast and free shuttle to/from the airport. We find the rooms fairly large, clean and comfortable. Some might find the bathrooms a bit small. TV has English channels. Staff is attentive and pleasant. Items in the mini-bar were reasonably priced. There is Internet in the lobby at an outrageous two Euros per minute. We have not eaten in the restaurant and, therefore, cannot comment on that. First and foremost, this an hotel for business folks. It lacks gemuetlchkeit but it surely meets our needs as travelers.

The place is design with business travellers in mind and like everything else in Germany, it is clean, comfortable and sufficient. It has all the basic items found in a standard 3 star establishment.The biggest advantage and selling point of this motel is the fact that it is very close to downtown frankfurt (about 1-2 stops in the subway), and its proximity to the main station. In addition, i blieve this is a chain managed by the much bigger and prestigious steinberger hotels.Excellent breakfast selection. Buffet style. Same Menu everyday. We stayed there for 5 days.

<Content>Poor experience Avoid booking this hotel if you're driving a car. The hotel is extremely difficult to find with an obscure address; according to the GPS in our rented car, the address did not even exist. It was likewise nearly impossible to find our way from the hotel to the airport (if one doesn't take a shuttle), and consequently we almost missed our plane. We arrived late to check-in at the hotel (just before midnight), yet our room STILL was not ready for us.We certainly do not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Only For Overnight Stays...And Then Only If You Are Desperate Let me just say right up front that I would not normally stay at a hotel like the InterCity Frankfurt Airport. It is a little too basic and cheaply furnished by standards that I am used to, but I will try not to be needlessly harsh with my comments.I stayed at the InterCity Frankfurt Airport Hotel for three nights to attend a business meeting at the property. The hotel is located right near the airport property in a suburb known as Cargo City Sud (South). The area is aptly named since there is literally nothing else around the hotel except warehouses full of cargo waiting to come in to the city or go out of the airport. If you need some small item from the store or access to an ATM, then you will be spending about 15 euros in taxi fare to get it. I briefly toyed with the idea of renting a car, but after closer inspection I noticed that there would be no place to park it at the hotel.Upon arrival at the hotel, I was underwhelmed. The facade of the hotel is done in a drab, depressing combination of white, gray, and black. This, in conjunction with the overall flat, plain style and design of the building, creates a structure that is more-than-reminiscent of a minimum security prison. That aside, the hotel grounds were very nice and well-kept. In the front were many mature trees and hedges that surrounded a nice volleyball court and beer-garden. There is a bronze plaque in the entryway proudly announcing that the hotel is rated as a four-star property (based on a five-star scale) through 2009 by the fine folks at the Deutschland Hotel Council. I found myself not only strongly disagreeing with this rating, but also wondering how spectacularly bad a one-star hotel would be. Not a pleasant thing to contemplate.The inside of the hotel is splashed in an unfortunate, unattractive combination of reds, whites, and several different hues of blue. This may be a quibble of sorts, or even just a taste preference, but all of the curtains were inexplicably a pastel peach color. Most of the public areas at this hotel are not air conditioned, and all of the hallways had a stuffy, stale feel except near the stairwells where the windows were always open. My room did have a vent, but it must have been controlled centrally since no air came out of it and there was no thermostat to be found. A colleague of mine also staying at the hotel said his room had a/c, but it didn't work. It wasn't unbearably hot in my room, but it was necessary to have some fresh air. Unfortunately, getting some fresh air inside my room required opening the solitary window. This was indeed a dilemma. When the window was open, some fresh air was allowed in along with a hint of greasy fumes from the kitchen exhaust vents that were located nearby. Some fine particulates also floated in when the window was open, and I suspect these were either grease flakes from the kitchen or rubber particles from the very busy (and noisy) motorway that was adjacent to the property. This could have just been due to which way the wind was blowing when I was there, but I don't plan to really find out by visiting the property again.All of the hotel employees were attentive and seemed eager to please. The restaurant (The Fluggi) had a decent buffet at each mealtime, and the food was good. The pub (Ju 52) was quaint and stocked with plenty of good beer and spirits. The bartenders were friendly and kept the libations flowing well even though it was extremely busy each time I was there. My room was clean but spartan. The bathroom was tiny even by European standards, and contained a shower with no tub. No bar soap or shampoo was provided. Instead, liquid dispensers containing body wash were installed in the shower and next to the sink. A grand total of three towels were provided each day. One for the shower, one for the sink, and one as the bathmat. They were all the same size and texture, so I guess it really didn't matter how they were used. The room did have a decently stocked minibar, which was an unexpected surprise in a hotel of this caliber. The bed was a double-sized mattress (no box springs) suspended about three inches above the floor by a leather wrapped bedframe. A solitary pillow and single-sized combination sheet/comforter were provided. I guess the hotel management figured you wouldn't be cold enough to need a double-sized sheet. They are right, I suppose, if you aren't brave enough to open the window. Strangely enough, the bed slept well and was comfortable. Or, maybe it was just the jetlag. Who knows?The hotel literature in the room said that only dial-up internet access was available (who does that anymore?), but I soon discovered, fortunately, that there was wireless access available for 15 euro/day. Overall, this would be an okay hotel to stay at for one night if you had a long layover or wanted to rest before a long flight. Even then, I'm sure that there are better alternatives nearby with nicer facilites. Unless you absolutely have to be near the airport don't stay here. The money you save on the cheap nightly rate will be spent on taxis or buses into the city. I guess my British colleague stated it best when he said, This isn't a proper business hotel!

<Content>Functional but fine This hotel is fine for a functional stay but it didn't offer anything special. The room and bathroomwere clean although very stuffy at night and I didn't find the aircon helped much. The buffet breakfast was good but the evening meal was not exciting and was rather over cooked. Queues for reception always seemed to be a bit long but the staff were helpful.Over all I'd say it's fine for a night or two in a spot convenient for Frankfurt station but I wouldn't want to stay any longer.

<Content>Just what I needed I needed a handy airport hotel for an overnight. Last time I stayed at one of the NH hotels and found it very far away and too much money for such a brief stay. The Intercity measured much better on the overall scale. It was more convenient and had everything I needed for my purpose--which was a place to sleep. The room was clean, well appointed and left me completely satisfied. The bus was rather crowded and probably should run every 20 minutes.

<Content>Hated the food! I have no complaints about any other aspect of the hotel (nice big room) but I would rather chew my own arm off than have that buffet EVER AGAIN.

<Content>Clean, cheap, close to the airport Reasonably priced, impeccably clean hotel located very close to the Frankfurt airport. We have stayed there in April 2006.During the day the hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from the airport, every half hour. The price of the taxi at 02:00 at night is 12.00 EUR from the shuttle bus stop at the airport to the hotel and it takes not more than 7 minutes to get there. The week end special price is 73.00 EUR for a double room.I seriously doubt that you can find any other rooms at this price so close to the airport. Especially if you just need a place to sleep before a morning flight, this hotel is hard to beat.

<Content>Only if you need close to airport Free shuttle runs every thirty minutes from each airport terminal to this hotel. The bus was often crowded and the driver offered no help with luggage. Rooms were clean; with TV, private WC and shower, and adequate furnishings. Cost does not include breakfast (would have been 16E per person), but does include a card good for transit into and around the city of Frankfurt. Staff was professional and courteous. This hotel is part of the Steinberger chain of hotels. But note that is another hotel, called Steinberger Hotel Airport. Do not confuse the two and take the wrong bus.Reservation was made online, directly with the hotel. A problem arose because I (foolishly) gave them my Discover Card number. They sent an e-mail saying my card was not accepted, but it took four requests from me before they stated the last four digits of the card they said they were having a problem with. As I never give a credit card number over an unsecure e-mail server, particularly when the person asking for it contacted me first; the problem with the initial card number given was not uncovered for several days. Once the issue was resolved, the reservation was no problem. Yes, the problem was my fault, but it could have resolved much more quickly.Due to being so far from the city of Frankfurt, I can only recommend this hotel if you have a early flight from Frankfurt Airport. if you do, and you can get a good price, then this is a useful place to stay.

<Content>Okay if you can't manage something better! Stayed here for 2 nights in Mya 2006. Had to stay near the airport as had flights out of Frankfurt each day. The other better hotels in the vicinity were all booked due to a fair in the city so booked this one though expedia.The hotel is okay...nothing really great but frankly speaking nothing bad too!The location is not really close to the airport, takes about Euros 10 to 12 by taxi and about 15 minutes by the free shuttle bus, that the hotel runs every 30 minuts.the shuttle bus can take ages to come and is lways crowded so travelling with large bags may be a daunting task as it does not have luggage storage area in it.Overall a fair enough hotel that is clean and business like.
