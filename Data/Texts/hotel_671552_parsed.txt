<Content>Great place for becoming part of Florence I travelled to Florence to visit my daughter who was studying there. The Hotel Silla is a small, casual hotel with a classic Florentine courtyard in the Oltrarno (which means just across the Arno) from the city center). It is an easy walk across the Ponte alle Grazie to the heart of Florence, and about 10 minutes from the Ponte Vecchio if you prefer that route. I don't know if there is a more reasonable hotel so close to everything. I don't care because the staff treated me so well I'm not inclined to look for anything else. Excellent free Wifi in the rooms let my daughter use it as an alternate library when she was writing one of her papers, and it let me stay in touch with folks back home. Traditional Italian breakfast included brioches, cappucino, cold cuts and even a egg-boiler.

<Content>Couldn't ask for more We stayed at Silla for two nights at the end of December. It's only a 7 euro taxi cab ride from the train station and it's in the ideal location, south of the Arno away from the crowds, yet within a 10 minute walk from the Duomo. We were warmly greeted and shown to our room on the third floor which overlooked the Arno. The staff attended to our every need and were extrememly helpful with everything.The standard room was large by european standards and was spotless. The room included a desk, coat closet, mini bar, and small tv. The bathroom was small, but clean and well appointed. Included in the room rate was a very nice continental breakfast which was in a large room near the front desk. Apparently, during the summer months, breakfast is served outside on a patio overlooking the Arno. Coffee service is great and there are plenty of breakfast selections.You can't beat the location, amenities, cleanliness, and service. Especially at the prices offered. This place is highly recommended.

<Content>a wonderful time we are still reminiscing We booked this hotel from the reviews on this web site, and we were not disappointed. It was a few months back now that we stayed here,but finally I have the time to write this review. I can still remember the scent of the flowers on the terrace where we had breakfast every morning, which was the highlight of staying here, The staff were wonderful and very helpful The location is quite, and yet it is walkable to all the main attractions of Florence. I know we will come back again .

<Content>Fabulous location for exploring Florence I saw some mixed reviews on this site so was a little hesitant to book this hotel, but my doubts were unfounded and we had a lovely time here for 2 nights in November. Our worst problem was getting there by car. Instead of following the directions on the hotel web site we let our GPS guide us - not knowing that the day we arrived there was a transit strike meaning every motorized vehicle on earth was in Florence that day. The GPS brought us in across the entire city from the north and the hotel is south of the river, so it was a hairraising journey and not one I'd like to repeat. Two days later we left town by the route suggested by the hotel which approaches Florence from the south. It's a beautiful drive and would have been so much less stressful! Potential visitors, take note!Once we arrived, the guys on the front desk were super friendly and helpful, apologizing for the strike like it was their fault, and we parked in the garage (yes, the spaces are TINY!) and didn't think about driving for the next 2 days. Breakfasts were the usual big spread of continental fare (very good). Our room was big, the bed a little hard (but to be fair we found the same everywhere in Italy) and other than a trashcan which never got emptied from the minute we arrived, all was perfectly fine.Cannot imagine being in Florence in summer, it must be a zoo. Fall is a great time to visit, with no problems getting into any museums, exhibits, restaurants. And Silla is a great base for exploring, being a mere couple of minutes walk from the Ponte Vecchio

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Price, Great Location Hotel Silla was a great hotel. The location was incredible, with a beautiful view of the park and the river in the background. The rooms were well appointed, and very clean. The front desk staff and the breakfast staff were just so wonderful, had great recommendations and were eager to help us in any way. The location was perfect as it was across the bridge from the city. It was a quick walk to all of the sights in Florence, and a calm, quiet respite at the end of the day.

The breakfast was excellent. There is a very nice rooftop terrace where drinks are served in the late afternoon and evening. The location across the Arno (Oltrarno) from the historic downtown offers welcome relief from the crowds while still being very convenient (10 minute walk to the Duomo).

<Content>Great Hotel for price and location We stayed here for 4 nights in mid-October. We had an upper room that looked out over the back street and was very quiet. The room was very large comfortable and very clean. The location is perfect - far enough from downtown to not be in the thick of things but within walking distance of everything. The staff were particularly helpful especially with local dinner suggestions around Santa Crocce. Each evening we enjoyed a drink on the hotel terrace with guests from all over the world. Would highly recommend the Silla Hotel.

<Content>Quaint Hotel, helpful staff The hotel has a wonderful location that allows easy access to the florence attractions. It is located within sight of the Arno river, and easy walking distance to the ponte vecchio bridge. The only difficulty we had was finding it when traveling from the Siena area. Parking on the street is also difficult to find once you reach the hotel, so we would recommend the extra cost of using their parking garage. The room was large, but very spartan in appearance. However, it was very clean and comfortable. As prices go, it was very reasonable compared to what one could pay in that area. Breakfast at the hotel was very nice, and many restaurants are within walking distance to satisfy anyone's needs. The staff did their best to make sure your needs taken care of, and your questions were answered.

<Content>Great Visit The employees of Hotel Silla were very helpful while I was making plans via emial. Once at the hotel, the staff was friendly and very knowledgable, the rooms clean and quiet. I did hear from a guest that her room on the first floor was noisey due to guests coming and going so I would suggest a higher floor. My husband and I were on the 3rd floor and all was quiet. A nice continental breakast was offered every morning. A nice way to relax after a full day of sighseeing was to purchase a bottle of wine and some cheese and crackers and go out onto the patio of the hotel and look out over the Arno River.

<Content>Great autumn break On the south side of the Arno, away from the busy traffic, an excellent hotel. Staff very helpful and spoke good english. Our room at the front had a view of the Duomo just across the river. There is a bar in the street below which was noisy one night but generally excellent. Also nearby restaurants good and inexpensive.Only 10 mins walk to the sights and a good bus service nearby.The bedroom adequate and very comfortable bed.We would definitely use the hotel again. It was lovely walking across the river each day and far more peaceful than the touristy middle.A small supermarket nearby was useful too. And also a good pizza place in the same street.

The room was very comfortable, the staff very helpful and personable. They made reservations for us at the Uffiz and the Academy (to see Michaelangelo's David). We walked everywhere from the hotel after parking the car in their garage. You are just minutes away from most of the major sites in Florence at Hotel Silla. I'd stay again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great location across Arno River Hotel Silla is a great find across the river from all the main sights in Florence. Their customer service is top notch, they are always willing to answer questions, recommend a restaurant or reserve an entrance to a museum or tourist attraction. They provide free internet access in the lobby, and their breakfast is terrific! Also, enjoy a bottle or glass of wine outside on the terrace in the evening. It's generally quiet, but be aware that on a weekend evening, it can get loud as there are a few restaurants  bars on the block where locals party. We had a great stay, and would return to Hotel Silla again.

<Content>Great location and friendly service! My wife and I booked a 4 night stay at Hotel Silla after reading the great reviews here and we are really glad we did! First of all, our room was clean, huge and even had a second room with a third bed. We did not book this on purpose, but it would be perfect for someone traveling with a child. The hotel location is great, as Florence is a very walkable city. You won't get overrun by tourists in the neighborhood around Silla, but you will see a lot of young people at the nearby restaurants and bars.The staff at Hotel Silla absolutely make it stand out as excellent. Massimo was extremely helpful for us, giving us great restaurant suggestions, help with booking tickets to the Uffizi, and also going out of his way to set us a table on the hotel terrace when we arrived with wine and cheese we purchased down the street. I highly recommend Hotel Silla as a great place to stay in Florence!

<Content>A Tuscan treat! The Hotel Silla is a well-situated, clean and comfortable respite from the busy streets of Florence.The hotel is quiet, though located within walking distance of the main sights of Florence. The staff at the Silla are exceptionally friendly and helpful and really made us feel like honoured guests. The rooms are small, but not crowded and with all the things to see in Florence you don't spend much time in your hotel room. The bathroom is spacious, with an enclosed shower (so the whole room doesn't get soaked!) and shelves for your toiletries, which many hotels seem to overlook. The roof top terrace is a lovely place for breakfast or writing postcards with a glass of chianti at hand. The breakfast buffet had all the things we like: yogurt, fresh fruit, local pastries plus hot items for those who prefer eggs, toast, etc. I would definitely stay at the Silla again.

<Content>wonderful staff, lovely terrace The interior is in need of an update, but this is part of it's charm. The location is on the other side of the Arno, and perfect for some of the quieter sites (Boboli gardens, Piazzale Michelangelo) while the main tourist attractions are just a walk across the bridge. Our room faced the river and was clean and comfortable, although a bit loud. If you want the view, you're going to hear the traffic. The staff was perfectly lovely- wonderful, warm, and helpful. Be sure to have dinner at Cingale Bianco (a few blocks away) and get the amazing pear ravioli at the trattoria down the street.

The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay (we were there a week). The greatest surprise was that there was a breakfast buffet every morning which set up our day of sightseeing just great. The hotel is located a few minutes walk from the Ponte Vecchio one way or Santa Croce church the other. The bus stop is just across the street and the number 23 takes you straight in town all the way to the train station. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel! The could easily have been a bad review...we checked into a room on the first floor (#6) and although we were a little disappointed with the look of the room (it was a little hostel-y) we decided to make the best of it. The next morning we were woken quite early because of the proximity to the bar/breakfast area. The floors are marble terrazzo in hallway and the even the slightest sound was magnified. Over breakfast we decided to check with the front desk about changing rooms. They could not have been more accommodating and immediately switched us a lovely room on the third floor. We wished were were staying longer! They didn't even charge us for the upgrade! They new room had a beautiful view, a huge bed, big bathroom (with a separate shower) and it was quiet.This hotel is a very short walk to anything you want to see in Florence. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat (just not on the main floor!)

We had a lovely view of the garden square out front and the duomo in the distance. Every time we passed the front desk, they would inquire if we needed anything... they were wonderful.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! We chose the Silla Hotel from a guide book because it was a small hotel and on the quieter side of the River Arno and the building itself sounded interesting. The staff were friendly and helpful to any questions we asked. Even though we didn't have one of the most expensive rooms, we had a lovely view over the balcony with flowers, trees and partially of the river. Everything was clean with extra amenities such as the safe included in the cost.The location was perfect, it was easy walking distance to all the cities main attractions and behind the hotel we walked to some beautiful Tuscan views. There is an excellent pizzeria on the same road too!I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.

<Content>A Tuscany Treat Wow! We selected Hotel Silla due to the reviews of others and the location. We certainly made the correct choice. Our stay of three nights was delightful. The staff went out of their way to help us in SO many ways. We inquired about finding a flea market with old rusty leftover things. The next day we had a note with a map of where to go and it was a treasure trove of exactly the kind of things we were looking for. When the train strike hit on our travel day, the staff could not have been more helpful. We loved our breakfasts in the morning on the balcony overlooking the Arno. We booked two walking tours through the hotel before we arrived. They were excellent--one with four of us and the other with eight of us which made for a very intimate and calm experience. I can only hope that I will get to visit Hotel Silla again!

<Content>Absolutely LOVED it here It was an absolutely fabulous stay. The perfect location... Away from the hustle bustle of the city center and not too far either (Just on the other side of the Arno river). You could even walk all the way to the train station (20 min) if you so choose. And if you want to take the bus, there's one every 10 min literally steps outside the hotel. The hotel staff spoke good english and was courteous and helpful. They got us reservations to the Ulfizi and other major musems, when our train was delayed they were able to push our meseum reservations further back. They were also willing to give us their idea of places to visit when asked.... Basically just incredibly helpful.The breakfast offered was great as well... .Fresh fruit, freshly boiled eggs, ham cheese cappuchino you name it.... you could leave with a full stomach that will last you well into lunch time. But again, the best thing I would say about the hotel is its location. Florence can get pretty crowded especially in August when we went and at the end of the day you get pretty tired and just want a peaceful place to relax and unwind. This hotel is just that. Towards the end of our trip we even thought it worth the time to take a couple of hours off in the afternoon and come back for a shower and siesta.I would recommend anyone whole heartedly to this hotel. For the price they offered this place is an absolute steal.

<Content>Nice hotel in artists' section We loved the location of the hotel, in an artists' section on the left bank of the Arno, away from the noise and crowds of central Florence but only about a ten minutes' walk from the Uffizi or Santa Croce. The hotel had a parking garage (鈧?6), which was a great benefit since parking isn't easy in central Florence. You enter the hotel from a small, quiet, pretty courtyard off the street. You take a staircase or an elevator to the second floor to find the reception. Our room and bathroom were both rather small, but clean and well maintained. From our window we had a partial view across the Arno to Florence, through a small garden -- quite pretty. The young man at the reception was really unusually friendly and helpful, and spoke English quite well. The management reserved us tickets for the Uffizi at no charge. We were pleasantly surprised at the generous breakfast provided on the wonderfully pretty roof garden (this is included in the night's rate). At 鈧?50 this was no bargain, but from what we understand this is within the expected range for Florence.

<Content>A Splendid, Good Value Stay Near Santa Croce Suffice it to say, Florence offers the traveler a bewildering array of accommodations, with this hotel, the Silla, being a standout for combining convenience of location, fine, personalized service, along with a very fair rate.The Silla overlooks the River Arno, about a 10-minute walk to the magnificent Santa Croce church. My wife and I enjoyed a fine city view from our view, including a distant look at the marvelous Duomo. The Silla's convenient location cannot be overemphasized, and it includes a small grocery store that is ideal for picking up a wide range of snacks and libations. (Use the fridge in your room to store such goodies, at a much reduced cost from those sky-high hotel rates.)Our room at the Silla was clean and bright, and a/c was much appreciated as it was very warm during our stay in Florence. There is cable TV on offer, and the bathroom was reasonable in its size. One noteworthy drawback, however, concerns the towels. Can you say dishtowel? Indeed, so lean are these bathroom accessories that one doubts Popeye's girlfriend would have trouble drying herself. Still, one is hard pressed to dwell on the Silla's towels as the Silla more than compensates with friendly, helpful front desk service, and the cost of a double is more than fair, especially given the hotel's handy location. In addition, while the Silla is located in a very busy area, it always seemed to have a peaceful air about it. Perhaps this can be attributed to the hotel's lovely courtyard and staircase that leads one up to the front desk. Also, the Silla has an outdoor porch where the traveler can take breakfast. This is quite attractive, and the buffet breakfast is tasty with a wide array of offferings.Staying in Florence? Do give serious consideration to the Hotel Silla. It offers the traveler much in the way of comfort, considerate service, and fine value for money.

<Content>Great Value My friend and I stayed at hotel Silla in July and really felt that it was a great value for Florence. We got an online rate of 90 euros for a double room. We liked the Otrarno area, great restaurants and not too far to walk to popular tourist sites. The rooms were clean and had the hotel staff were very helpful and nice. The best part of the hotel is their breakfast and breakfast patio. The only negative in my opinion was that the beds weren't that comfortable.

<Content>Florence hotel with outside breakfast patio I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my 3 night stop over in Florence staying at this hotel.It may be on the other side of the river and slightly away from the centre but it will satisfy all your needs.The hotel itself can be reached from the train station by bus as walking with bags is probably a bit to far.It is set back from the main road behind a small park  street with access through a courtyard and up a lift.I had booked a single room at a reasonable price so did not expect to much.The room I was given on the 2nd floor overlooking the front was clean  a bit dated but for a single room in Italy it was a reasonable size.Its full length double windows opened completely so did give an open  spacious feeling to a single room.The rest of the hotel was clean, tiled and with helpful staff on reception.The main reason for booking this hotel was the open air breakfast patio with tables and parasols on the 1st floor roof.This was quite large and made a nice start to the day  is something you will struggle to get more central.It also doubled up as a rest area that you could use after a long day site seeing. This was ideal with the small shop next door that enabled you to purchase items to enjoy on the patio before your evening entertainment in Florence.A small bar further down the road can also provide a bit of excitement at the weekend and the noise does not intrude that much.In summary if you are happy to live with a 10 min walk to the area around the Uffizi.This hotel is ideal for price and gives you an out door area to relax in before you explore Florence.

<Content>Stay Somewhere Else My wife and I were honeymooning in Italy and Austria for two weeks. All of our hotels were between $140 and $200 per night. Of all the hotels we stayed at, this is the one hotel that I would not recommend. In general, I am not a complainer. All I am looking for in a hotel is a clean place to sleep, a decent location and helpful staff who provide good customer service with smile. While the overall experience was not 鈥榥ightmarish鈥? it was far below my basic expectations; especially in light of the other reviews on this site and elsewhere. There just has to be a better value for your money. The Bad: When we arrived, they had no record of our reservation, which was particularly disconcerting since I had paid for one night (a deposit) prior to arriving. The saving grace was that I had printed off my confirmation email. Once in our room, we noticed that there was a sandy, gritty substance all over the floor as if it had not been swept or cleaned in quite some time(which was never cleaned up during our three nights there). This sandy substance was also on a portion of the bed sheets. Maybe the maid set them on the floor before putting them on the bed. Regardless it was a little gross. Every time we left the hotel, the staff at the front desk would ask when we planned to return (as if it were a hostel or something). One morning that we had planned to leave early in our car to visit Pisa, we went down and found that the hotel had allowed another hotel guest with a Mercedes Bens to block us into the garage. The guy at the front desk did not want to wake up the hotel guest, would not move it himself and said it would be another 45 minutes before his manager who could move the car would be arriving. He said the only thing he could do is give me the keys and let me move it. (they ask all guests to leave their car keys at the front desk) It was such a tight fit out of that garage, I almost took the side-view mirrors off three times before safely getting it out. Besides that, the guest had all sorts of personal things on the seats which any dishonest person could have taken. (I would not leave the keys to your car at the front desk-who knows who they will let drive your car). The best part was that they blamed me for the the whole thing saying that I should have told them we wanted to leave early. (Mind you, they charge $20.00 a night for the parking spot). The Good: they are located in a decent spot, just down the street from Ponte Vechio and about 5 minutes from Ufizi. The breakfast bar was adequate and the breakfast terrace was lovelyConclusion: There has to be a better value for your money than Hotel Silla. I will not stay there again, and would suggest people look elsewhere.

<Content>Great Hotel in Florence Silla Hotel is in a great location with good price for the value. The Hotel is walking distance to the center of Florence (i.e. about 10 minutes) . It is across the street from the Arno river. The amenities are very good: air conditioning that works all the time in the humid summertime; breakfast included in the room rate which is very complete (not just rolls and coffee); free internet access with a laptop in the lobby; two restaurants next door; and a friendly, knowledgable staff fluent in many languages. We will return.

<Content>Happy at Silla Hotel We stayed at Silla Hotel at the suggestion of our travel agent. it was a great suggestion. We liked everything about the hotel -- the price, the service, the room, the location, and the breakfast. The staff was truly remarkable -- bending over backwards to be helpful. The room was clean and ample (enough -- this is Florence!). The hotel is perfectly located. It is close enough to walk easily to most everything you would want to do in Florence but not right in the thick of things. Nicest of all was the breakfast, and in particular the breakfast terrace. It is on the 1st floor (i.e. US 2nd floor) overlooking a park and the city and filled with beautiful flowers, we hardly wanted to finish our breakfast (which was great -- had the best of US and Italian breakfast staples). One night we bought a bottle of wine and a picnic and ate dinner on the terrace -- complete with borrowed hotel wine glasses. The hotel also has a laptop in the lobby for guests to use and wireless thoughout-- an extra plus. We would stay there again in a minute.

<Content>Friendly Hotel in Florence The Silla is a lovely place to stay in Florence. The staff is the most friendly and helpful of any hotel I have stayed in anywhere (seriously). The rooms are large enough and have all the conveniences needed. Our daughter accompanied us on this trip and they arranged for her to have a room right next to ours with a view of the patio and the 脜rno River. For Florence it is also a great value with rates that are less than other hotels of equal or lesser value. There is also a small grocery store just down the block in case you need anything or feel like eating in. It is away from the noisey and touristy center of Florence but close enough to walk anywhere of interest. Also, cabs are fairly reasonably priced should you tire of walking. All things considered, a great place to stay in Florence.

<Content>Great Value, Location, Service The Silla was recommended to us by Italian-American friends who have stayed there many times and know Florence well. We were not only welcomed with gracious attention but our emails prior to arrival were answered promptly and our requests were fulfilled. For the price, we did not expect this level of service and were more than pleased. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking a small park (with the view of buildings across the river) was also more than a simple, Continental breakfast menu, with attentive service. It was a pleasant way to plan the day and feel completely on vacation.The room we were given had large doors to a Juliet balcony, a clean, simple bathroom with shower and one sufficient closet and dresser. Nothing fancy. Clean. Plenty of room (by European standards, for sure).Laura and Massimo at the front desk were very helpful with directons, recommendations and advice. We don't usually use a city hotel for more than a place to sleep and, so long as it's clean, safe and reasonably comfortable, we're happy to spend our money on other parts of the trip. If you don't need to be at the Ritz, this fills the bill more than adequately.

<Content>The Silla is fabulous and so reasonable Brilliant, quiet, family run, view over Arno, 5 mins walk from ponte vecchio - ask for room 23 or equivalent - aircond is whisper quiet but enough to mask traffic and partner's snoring. Recent refurbish is good though ensuite is small - who cares the shower works well. Lovely terrace for breakfast or drinks - minibar in room will take your duty free, but no tea making equipment (only minus point). Can't wait to get back.

<Content>Wonderfully Helpful Employees We totally got lost on our drive into Florence (note: follow all the directions on the Hotel website for driving in except for the bridges! Just hop across the river on the first one you come to and ask a local for ponte alla grazie (spelling?), the hotel is just before this bridge behind a park/square of trees). We had a cell phone and called the hotel for assistance. They were SO nice! And as soon as I walked into the reception area they said, You made it! They took care of our luggage, parked our car for us, and were just wonderful. I wouldn't book the economy room if you can afford the bigger rooms. The toilet was in the shower... weird. We took one look at the economy room and accepted the offered upgrade. Everything is within walking distance of the hotel (about 20 minutes to the Accademia). AND our favorite part: breakfast is served on a patio on the second floor (for americans, 1st floor if you are european) that overlooks the river and the park in front of the hotel. Its magical. After staying in hotels where the service was awful, we felt totally pampered by Hotel Silla. They even gave me the utensils I needed to make a sandwich late at night (you can buy bread, meat, and cheese at the little grocery downstairs). Fabulous!

<Content>Wonderful stay! My daughter and I stayed here for a week in early June, in order to attend a wedding of a friend, now living in Florence. What a great choice it was. The staff could not have been friendlier or more accommodating and efficient. Our room overlooked the Arno and I could open the large double windows and look out onto the terrace where we had delicious breakfasts in the morning, and see the city before us. The bathroom was fully equipped and large enough to be comfortable. The location of the Silla is superb. Close enough to walk to all the major sights, and to shop on the Ponte Vecchio or the market places. Yet it is also quieter than those in the center near the Duomo. Several excellent restaurants right nearby, even one just down the street.Silla is an excellent choice. EAch of the staff feels like family in a short time. We would stay here again and again.

<Content>Another great stay at the Hotel Silla I can't say enough about how wonderful the Hotel Silla is. We booked 2 triple rooms along the back of the hotel (one king and one twin). Rooms are spacious, clean, have blow dryers, bidets, great water pressure  you can get adapters at the front desk if needed. They serve breakfast on the terrace, weather permitting and it is wonderful. Eggs to hardboil, yogurt, cereal, toast, ham and cheese, fruit, croissants, nutella, juices, water and coffee are on the menu. My kids LOVED it. The staff is SO friendly and helpful. We stayed there the last time we came and I was so happy to be back again. It felt like our home away from home in Florence. There can be a little night noise on occasion but this is Florence after all... and we have had friends who stayed in the city center (at a very $$$ hotel) check out of their hotel to come to the other side of the river for less noise. Request a room along the back of the hotel if you want the most quiet.

<Content>Nice value in Florence My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Silla over 4 days in June, and had a really nice time here. We had a basic room on the bottom floor that was small, which we expected, but it was still nice and clean.I thought the best things about the hotel were the location, which made getting to the Uffizi and other attractions really simple, and the hotel staff. My wife thought the walk could be a little long at times, but she didn't exactly wear comfortable shoes. The front desk was very helpful with dinner reservations, and assisting with transportation and directions.Breakfast was better than we expected and we enjoyed the chocolate in the mornings. For the price, it is definitely a good bargain in Florence.

<Content>The Wonderful Hotel Silla Staying at the Hotel Silla was a wonderful way to begin our first trip to Florence.Hotel Silla is across the river from the city of Florence but that is just a 5 minute walk over one of the city's lovely bridges.We wanted to be part of the city scene but don't like the bustle and noise of inner city. That makes the Silla a perfect location.Also being able to have a meal before getting out into new territory is a perfect way to start the day - esp. being new to the language. Silla has a terrific breakfast buffet and a lovely lady makes your coffee to order . The hotel also has a patio for refreshments after a busy day with a great view and a wall covered with jasmine - what an exquisite memory of Florence the scent of jasmine is to us !The staff were wonderful and helpful .We look forward to returning to this amazing city and would stay at Hotel Silla again.

<Content>Not a Good Choice Hotel Silla was not a good choice...it was very noisy...the Hotel is worn, but the breakfast was good. On a map the location looks close to everything, but we have stayed at other Hotel's in Florence with better locations. After 8 trips to Italy, booking Hotel Silla was my worse booking ever...the internet overrates Hotel Silla. The bars with outdoor seating on the street in front of the Hotel were loud and stayed opened late...the street noisy from the cars, scooters, and motorcycles seemed like a race track. The pricing was in line with other Hotels...I just made a mistake in booking this Hotel, I should have done more homework.

<Content>Pleasant hotel, good rates My husband and I spent 6 nights at the Hotel Silla. We found the staff very professional, pleasant, and accomodating. The hotel is located away from the bustle of the tourist areas but within a 5 -10 minute walk to the Uffizi. Pitti Palace, or Santa Croce. The rooms are as advertised -not luxurious, a little spartan, but adequate and comfortable. The terrace is delightful, a perfect place for breakfast or an afternoon drink. The location is quiet except for occasional late night carousers on the weekend, not the hotel's fault but something to be aware of; bring some ear plugs just in case. Wireless internet is available along with a computer in the hotel lobby. The guide books recommend this hotel and we agree.

<Content>very nice, very special I go to Florence at least twice a year and like 3-star hotels: not too ritzy, not too rough. I have stayed in several fine hotels, a few too far out, and most with easy access to the center of town. The Silla was a special treat because it was quite close in, yet quiet, not terribly expensive and not as tiny as many similarly-priced hotels I have stayed in (Pitti Palace Ponte Vecchiio springs to mind . . . another favorite, but nowhere near as pretty! And without wifi.)The outside breakfast patio was in full bloom with a wall of incredible jasmine, potted roses, lavendar, bougainvilla, begonias, and marigolds (I do not know where the lime-scented came from in the publicity, but who cares. The patio is one floor above the street, overlooking a little park and the Arno. What a pleasure. The wifi was free and offered excellent reception. The staff was a little better than the typical Florentines in my experience, wiling to help with information, and the front desk even made a few telephone calls for me to get information when I found myself in town on a holiday weekend (which means not everything was always open). If this hotel is available and within the price range when i return in the fall, I will book here in a flash.

<Content>Lucky discovery Having spent a few months in Florence many years ago, and knowing my way around the city, I was looking for a hotel located within walking distance of the main cultural attractions, but away from the hectic city center. Hotel Silla was a perfect choice. A nice small plaza separates it from the Lungarno (the street that runs along the Arno River). From the terrace restaurant you get a nice view of the plaza, the river and the city skyline. Also, arriving at an elegant courtyard after a long city walk is far more pleasant that getting back to a small, crowded reception. The staff was kind and helpful, and my room (a triple) ample and comfortable., and reasonably priced. Florence is a jewel, but summer crowds can make it a bit suffocating. Hotel Silla lets you breathe.

<Content>Great Service at Hotel Silla! Hotel Silla is wonderfully located in the Oltrarno area of Florence - across the river - about a 5 minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio; and crossing the river about 20 minutes from the Duomo, at a very leisurely pace. The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. I was in contact with them for many weeks prior to arriving, and they helped to arrange a private driver to the wine country, as well as a group tour at the last minute when our plans changed. They provided restaurant recommendations and reservations for some museums that required them. I believe all of the desk staff spoke English.The included breakfast was more than adequate - it is the same each day, but offers fresh fruit and juices, as well as eggs, toast and pastries, meat and cheese, yoghurt and cereal. The pleasant server takes your order for coffee, cappucino, cioccolata (hot chococate) or tea.There is a very nice terrace overlooking the river, from which you can see the dome of the Duomo, and the Palazzo Vecchio. It's a great place to enjoy a cocktail before dinner, as the bar closes at 8pm. The park in front of the hotel is a gathering place for locals and their dogs in the early evening, so you feel like you have a real view of local Florence, not just the tourist areas.The rooms are decent size for Europe, although somewhat plainly decorated. The bathrooms are modern, with good-sized towels and a hairdryer. We had a lovely view of the river.I would definitely stay there again. As a note - if you contact the hotel directly, you may find that you get a better deal than you find via other websites.

<Content>wonderful place to stay My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Hotel Silla. We decided to stay there after reading a review on this website. The hotel was even better than the reviews. It's a great location because it's a way from the noise of the busy part of Florence, but it is also an easy walk to everything. Our large room with a wonderful bathroom had a great view of the Arno. The buffet breakfast had cereals, fresh fruit, eggs, cheeses, meats, and fresh rolls. The hotel also has a wonderful terrance that faces the Arno. It's a great place to relax after spending the day walking around Florence. The hotel serves drinks on the terrace in the late afternoon until early evening. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel also provides free internet access on their laptop in the lobby. There is free wifi if you have your own laptop. We will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Florence.

<Content>Great location We stayed at the Hotel Silla on the recommendation of an acquaintance who lives in Florence. The location is ideal--close to all the attractions, but on the quiet side of the Arno. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the room was generous and very clean. We were in a room on the back of the hotel where there is a small, well-travelled street. This was very noisy on occasion, but we didn't notice it after a day or so.The dining room is lovely and a typical European buffet is served every morning. The waitstaff was most attentive and pleasant. There is an outside veranda available to all guests overlooking the park and the Arno which was a lovely feature, especially in the late afternoon and evening. Drinks are available here also.Overall, we rate this hotel very highly. We only wish the staff had told us about all the lovely restaurants in the area just behind the hotel. We discovered them the day before we were leaving and wish we'd known about them earlier.

<Content>Hotel Silla is the best! I stayed in hotel Silla for one week in April 2008, and loved every moment. The hotel is beautiful, as in an old palace, and the rooms are very nice and comfortable, Breakfast is very good, fresh and includes eggs, cereals, yoghurt, fruit, toast, cheese etc. The location of Silla is excellent, because you can easily walk everywhere to the attractions. But the best of Silla is the staff : everybody was so friendly, helpful and nice so that you feel as a royal princess. They do everything to help you, e.g, I wished to change room to get a view to the river and that succeeded nicely. I also needed an adapter and the reception helped with that, too. Also the ladies in breakfast room were very friendly and polite and made you feel welcome. I absolutely recommend this hotel, I think it is the friendliest hotel I've stayed at. Unforgottable! When I go to Florence again, I will go to Silla.

<Content>Hotel Silla shabby and way out of the way I had booked this hotel and noticed that they said they would charge the first night. When I arrived it was a two elevator ride to my room. It was a very long walk to a not very nice roomI also noticed that I would have to walk two blocks then cross a bridge every morning to get to the edge of the main part of Florence. We told them that we could not walk this far and that the room was inconvenient, especially for my husband who had walking problems. They said we should have called them sooner. We called an hour after we left and it was before check in time. They charged us $200 for the room. I would not recommend this hotel, mostly because what I saw of it wasn't very nice. They rooms are very worn.

<Content>The lovely Silla Me and my boyfriend booked Silla by Venere, based on TripAdvisor reviews and we couldn't have been happier!We went to Florence in order to celebrate our 7th year anniversary and we wanted to book a hotel that was both special and affordable (we are, after all, students and we don't have that much money and we wanted to splurge on sights an experiences, not on a room). Silla went beyond that.The room was cozy and always spotlessly clean. The rooms can be described as smallish but then again, who goes to Florence to spend their stay confined in a hotel room? Also our room, which was facing to Arno river, was quiet. No noise problems whatsoever, even though there are a few popular bars on the street. The breakfast was lovely and on a warm and sunny day served on the hotel terrace. The elderly lady serving breakfast was delightful, she didn't even cringe when I ordered our hot drinks with my terrible Italian skills.What sets Silla apart from other hotels is its service. We were always greeted with a smile and we got plenty of tips and help when we needed. It was like staying with friends. The staff gave us a map (which proved more useful than our guide book maps), called us a taxi, booked us restaurants and museum tickets (even before we got to Italy) and they always seemed to have time to ask how we were doing or how was our day. The location seems to make some people doubt whether it is too far from attractions. Let me put it this way: it is far enough from the noise and chaos but close enough to walk anywhere (for example, we went to Uffizi on a rather stormy morning without umbrellas an we didn't get that wet).In all, for us Silla was the most perfect choice we could have made. And we decided that it was not because it fits our budget travelling mentality, we would honestly book a room even if we were millionnaires. Actually, my boyfriend insists upon it :)

<Content>Great Service, Perfect Location Great location in the very quiant San Niccolo neighbourhood; just accross the Arno and the main centre of Florence, very easy enjoyable walk to all the major sites, but you enjoy the setting of a true Florentinian residential neighbourhood. Great pizza restaurant on the same street as well as two great coffe/bar places next door. Pharmacy and small grocery store also next door.The hotel is very clean, 24 hour front desk service, and the staff are all pleasant, and accomodating. I arrived to Florence, however my luggage did not, the front desk staff were constantly contacting the airline to ensure my luggage would arrive. My room was the front of the building, with a pretty view. Rooms are simple, but clean. Breakfast is included in the price; cute breakfast room with breakfast buffet.Good value for the price! Definately will be back! Thanks to the staff at Hotel Silla, their professionalism and friendliness was very much appreicated!

<Content>Great Location My husband and I spent 5 nights in this hotel. We wanted to stay in the Oltrarno district of Florence to get a feel for Italian life in this city outside of the city center. The hotel is located across the Ponte alle Grazie and a block off a busy street on the Via dei Renai. You can access the center city within a few minutes walk. We were just a couple of blocks from the Ponte Vecchio, the Pitti Palace and the Uffizi Gallery. Our room faced a little park and looked over the Arno. Although the view was great, the street noise was distracting at times. There were two very popular bars/restaurants down from the hotel where patrons spilled out onto the streets. If you aren't into listening to the buzz of city life, ask for a room in the back of the hotel away from the street. The room was quite comforable. It had a desk, dresser and a wardrobe. The bed was firm and there were plenty of pillows. There is wireless Internet access available in the hotel if you bring your computer. There is also a computer in the hotel lobby for your use.There were plenty of choices for breakfast: eggs to boil, toast, cereal, fruit, juice, yogurt, pastries and cappucino or black coffee.The staff were very helpful. They spoke English and were very tolerant of my husband's attempts at Italian. (He practiced with the Rosetta Stone for 6 months prior to the trip.)We recommend this hotel for those who want a different view of Florence.

It was easy to find the hotel after a short walk. The room and bathroom were very large. It was the most spacious one of the six cities we visited in Europe. The room was very quiet. It had a large window that opened up wide. It had A/C, a safe, and TV. The breakfast was fantastic! There was such a large variety: fresh fruit, toast, eggs, granola, yogart, etc., I can't even remember all of the selections of food,there was so much and several different beverages. The service was excellent. It was served on a large outside patio with pretty flowers and small trees. The hotel management was very friendly, professional and helpful. We emailed before we arrived to ask them to reserve tickets for the Uffenzi, and they had arranged it for us. I must say, we were not very impressed with the Uffenzi Musuem. We needed to mail some things home,, and they gave us directions to a place nearby. There are two restaurants on the same street, that were good and very friendly. Also, a small store that was convenient. The hotel is at the end of a not too busy street, which made it nice. It was not a far walk to shopping and the famous sites. I would stay with them again.Mrs. Holmes

<Content>Great Place This is a great place to stay in Florence. The hotel was clean and the staff were warm and welcoming. The rooms and hotel were spotless. The breakfast which was included was excellent. It was a little off the path which made a cab ride a little expensive, however, the price of the hotel was very reasonable considering the quality, which made up for it. I highly recommend this hotel!!

<Content>Excellent location on the Arno; clean rooms My husband and I stayed here for a weekend in late October, and this was our third trip to Florence. For the money, Silla's location, right on the Arno is peaceful and convenient, is a great deal. It took less than 15 minutes to walk to the Duomo, and the Uffizi is almost directly across the river. In the past, we've paid about three times more to stay on Via Tuornabuoni, and we didn't think that location was worth the enormous markup when you consider how small and walkable Florence is.In addition to visiting all the big sights and restaurants in the city, I enjoyed exploring this oltrano side of the Arno, particularly the restaurants just behind the hotel, including the Enoteca Bar Fuori Porta, glowingly-written up a few months ago in the New York Times. Our room was clean and roomy, if somewhat institutional and charmless, and the hotel service was helpful and polite.

<Content>Fantastic Experience This was my first trip to Europe and Italy. It was fantastic. My interest was to attend cooking classes in Bologna, Italy for 4 days. I went to Florence 3 days early to see some of Italy. I found Hotel Silla on a website which compared hotels. In my opinion the hotel staff, the facility, its location were far more than what I was expecting. The rooms were nice, very clean, with a good breakfast served every morning. Although what made the difference was the staff - PERFECT is a good explanation. They were friendly, great appearance, most spoke good english (which is great since i do not know much Italian). My special thanks to Salvo for all your help to experience an Italy that I hope to never forget. Hotel Silla is a must stay while in Florence. John

<Content>Silla Is A Decent Choice Hotel Silla is good for the value. The staff was friendly enough, informative and helpful. The hotel was charming and the breakfast was good. The breakfast included fruits, yogurt, bread, eggs, cold cuts, juice and fresh coffee. Florence is a beautiful city but most hotels are located on very busy streets. Thats fine if you like to wake up with the traffice noise but for us, we needed some peace and quiet in the morning. Hotel Silla offered that. One major complaint we had though was the thinness of the walls. After walking around Florence, we are dead tired. We needed to nap or rest before heading out to dinner. The couple next door to us had the same idea but they did not rest. They talked and they watched tv. Thats fine but its not fine when we can clearly hear everything they are saying or listening to. The walls must be made of paper.The room was pretty small...just enough for the bed. Also, there is no real form of security. We had to leave the key with the staff whenever we left the room and there was no safe in the room. Also, on our last day, our train left later than check out so we asked them to hold our bags which they gladly did. But, when we came back to pick up the bags, the bags were just out in the open for anyone to just grab. Nothing bad happened but it was odd. With this all said, Hotel Silla is a decent choice. I dont think I would stay here again but it was a good value esp with the weakness of the dollar.

<Content>Excellent hotel Our stay at Hotel Silla was a great experience. The staff are gracious and very helpful. Our room was located on the 4th floor of the building was very clean with all the linens changed everyday. The breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, cheese, cold cuts, scrambled and boiled eggs. They also had capuccinos, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The buns and bread were fresh and plentiful. I would definitely recommend this property.

<Content>The Silla was wonderful! My daughter and I were celebrating significant birthdays, and decided to spend 7 days in Florence,using it as our home base to take tours through Tuscany and the Cinque Terre. We were very pleased with our choice of the Hotel Silla. It's location was perfect, a view of the Arno from the Oltrarno side and just a short walk to the Ponte Vecchio and Piazza della Republica. The room was clean and comfortable, bathroom quite adequate,and the breakfast excellent. No matter what the hour, the front desk personnel were extremely helpful in making or recomfirming reservations. Excellent English was spoken. I have stayed at several 5 star hotels in Florence in the past, but would not hesitate to return to this lovely 3 star Hotel Silla. We thought we received excellent value for the price.Rosalind Foer from Virginia Beach, Virginia

<Content>Best Service in Florence The staff at this hotel goes beyond what you would expect. The location is a five minute walk from the Uffizi or the Ponte Vecchio. You can catch the #13 bus to the Piazza Michaelangelo on the street next to the hotel. The room and bathroom were the cleanest of any hotel I have stayed at. While this is not the Ritz Carlton, the rooms are pleasant, comfortable and quiet. My family started out with two rooms, but ended up moving to one room as the room was so much larger than we anticipated when we booked it.

<Content>Close to the Arno We arrived in Florence from Bologna. The hotel in Bologna was lovely but the staff were surly and not properly trained in interacting with tourists. The staff at Hotel Silla were wonderful. Ready to welcome us after our train travel, and helpful in every way possible. No matter what we asked they were able to provide assistance whether first thing in the morning or late in the evening. The terrace garden was relaxing and the location quiet and away from the crowds of tourists in the center of Florence.

<Content>Affordable Florence Gem We recently spent five days at this hotel in Florence, Italy and would recommend it to all. It is located along the Arno within walking distance of the Ponte Vecchio and all the historical sites. We booked two rooms for the five of us. We stayed on the first floor, and both rooms were large and clean with an abundance of linen towels changed every day. The beds were comfortable, but not luxurious. The staff was extremely helpful and accomodating. Breakfast was included and consisted of scrambled or soft boiled eggs, various pastries, toast, fruit, cereal, juice, and choice of hot drinks (including cappucinos!). We felt safe and secure in this fairly quiet location. Overall, I would recommend this small, three star hotel for all who are looking for a quieter, affordable, homey, accomodation in Florence.

<Content>Great experience...staff, location and accomodations Found this place in Rick Steve's book on Italy and it turned out to be a treasure. Just a couple of blocks from Ponte Vechio just off the river, the accomodations were great, the staff incrediblky helpful. We requested a transfer through the hotel to and from the train station as well as reservations at the Uffuzi and Acadamia and the hotel had everything we asked for taken care of when we arrived in Florence. Driverr met us at the train station and assisted with luggage. Driver and bellman took care of the luggage at the hotel both from and to the train station. Our room overlooked the rooftop patio dining area which was a great place for a very pleasant evening glass of wine. Breakfast was included in our rate and the food was abundant and goodBottom line we had zero problems and I'd recommend the Silla to anyone!

<Content>Wonderful, helpful staff - great breakfast buffet My mother  I stayed at the Hotel Silla, Florence Italy in September 2007. From the outset, we were treated with great courtesy and assistance. The staff were very accommodating in suggesting the best tours and restaurants and made sure we were aware of historic and pleasant sites within walking distance. They also made sure we were aware of areas we should avoid and they were very helpful when it rained, providing us with umbrellas. Our room was spacious, spotless and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel was set back from the street with a small park and was quite quiet at night. Breakfast, whether on the lovely patio or in the nearby dining area was very good and the espresso delicious. My only recommendation would be to improve the lighting at each bedside for those who are in the habit of reading before going to sleep. Visitors to Florence would be well-advised to stay at this hotel!

Although most of the guests at the hotel were American, it seemed to be in a less touristy area. the reception desk was very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English. The breakfast offered the largest selection we had seen in our 2 weeks in Italy. The room was rather spacious but a small bathroom. Everything was very nice.

<Content>The Hotel Silla is a great value We found the hotel on the internet and recommended the travel agent check it out. We chose it because it was reasonably priced and within easy waking distance to cross the bridge into old Firenze. We had great breakfasts the 2 days we were in Florence, and the staff made us reservations at a great restaurant just across the Arno River. They also arranged a Tuscany tour for us. The only drawbacks were the cost for using their garage for our rental car, and phone charges to call '800' numbers to fix ATM card problems.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Gracious Staff We spent 3 nights at the Hotel Silla last month. Rooms are very pleasant and spacious; the bathroom is large and modern. We loved everything about Silla from the courtyard entrance to the outdoor patio overlooking the street (and the park). Breakfast (served indoors or out, depending on the weather) was excellent with a selection of eggs (scrambled or cook your own), meats and cheeses, pastries and excellent espresso, cappuccino or cafe latte. Gracious server. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. The location is excellent--a very pleasant walk across the river into the heart of Florence, yet part of an interesting neighborhood, San Niccolo, which we enjoyed exploring. There is a pizzeria right across the street (can't remember the name) where we enjoyed the best pizza we've ever eaten! At night, we sat on the elevated patio, drinking wine and watching the show below--a very lively street scene. If I get back to Florence, I will definitely stay at Silla again.

<Content>The Best Service The hotel staff is beyond belief - there was nothing we asked about (or for) that they didn't do their best to provide - from helping with lost luggage, suggestions on restaurants in the area, use of the Internet to check email, reservations at various museums, calling cabs - it was amazing. The room was spacious and air-conditioned, the bathroom was clean, the location is superb (no street noise), the breakfasts on the terrace were wonderful. I would stay in this 17th century villa again without hesitation.

<Content>Super hotel Hotel Silla is quiet, beautiful hotel. I stayed there with my wife and son while we went to a cousin's wedding outside of Florence. Great location - walking distance to Ponte Vecchio and the shopping district, antiques, and Boboli gardens etc...I recommend walking , driving in Florence can be confusing - a lot of one ways and you are not allowed in the downtown unless you have a sticker which can be monitored via the stop lights and you will get a ticket.Great breakfast on their patio, the 2 signore at breakfast were great and made a highchair out of pillows for my son. Also 2 cool bars and a supermarket a few doors away were great to have close by.Front desk and bell staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant with directions, restaurant recommendations, and helping change our train reservations. They even allowed me to use their laundry to press my suit before the wedding.If you want to be away from the crowds but close enough to walk to everything then the Hotel Silla is and excellent choice.

<Content>Great hotel, great location We stayed here for one night on August 28th as a last minute decision to leave Venice early and go to Florence and based on the good reviews on this site. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful, there is a safety deposit box in the room, and the shower is great (not hand held and good pressure). It鈥檚 about a five minute or less walk to Ponte Vecchio which is close to the other sites. From the train station we took bus #23 (buy your bus tickets in advance from inside the station), get off at the stop right after passing the Arno river, take a right turn, then left turn to get to hotel. There is a supermarket close by (bought water and snacks before heading out each day). Room has AC. Would stay here again for sure and recommend to others.

<Content>Great location, great staff A very nice hotel close to everything you might want to see without paying through the nose. We spent two night at the hotel and enjoyed them for the most part. We were first located on the top floor but then a thunderstorm rolled in and it rained hard non-stop for two hours and the ceiling in our room started to leak and we were moved to a lower level room which unfortunately was smaller and much noisier. This would be my only criticism of the hotel that the noise level of people coming back for the night carried right into our room, so if you book ask for a third floor room.The staff was above average and the breakfast on the terrace was lovely. Florence is a very walkable city and we were at the Ponte Vecchio in under 10 minutes from the hotel.So, over all a very good hotel and a good price.

<Content>A Find.... Driving in Florence is a nightmare. So, when I find a hotel that is easily reached by car without driving through the center of the city - and that has a parking garage next door, this is a real discovery. This hotel is a charming. Eating breakfast on the terrace while overlooking the Arno is sublime. The staff is very accomodating and eager to please.Just remember... this is not a 5 star luxury resort. This is a fabulous little hotel within walking distance of everything you want to see in Florence. Are the chandeliers Venetian glass? Probably not.... but they are clean and shiny, as is everything in this hotel. For this price - I love it. If you are willing to spend double their rates, you probably should not stay here. But, if like myself you'd rather spend money on dining out or souveniers, this hotel will help you economize.

Downside: hotel faces Arno River and main street plus an alley behind the hotel so it can be somewhat noisy with traffic. Ask for a room in front of hotel facing the river.

<Content>Hotel Silla in Florence Wonderful This was our first time to Italy and we planned our trip ourselves. We selected Hotel Silla based on reading reviews on the web and seeing pictures of it on their website. It was in our price range and so we took a chance. Everything was exactly as advertised. Directions to the hotel from the train station by bus were easy. We loved the location which was away from the hustle and bustle of the inner city but walking distance to everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was large, clean and over looked a patio with beautiful flowers. We enjoyed sitting on the patio in the late afternoon while resting before going out again in the evenings.Breakfast was included which was served on their beautiful patio (the weather was perfect). They had a buffet of rolls, cereal, fruit, yogurt, eggs, toast, fruit juices, coffee and tea.  We definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

Flowers and trees surround this second floor retreat. We returned in the afternoon for a drink and a moment to put our feet up after a day of wandering and sightseeing. The Hotel is located on the other side of the Arno. THis makes for a quiet location within walking distance to the Ponte de Verde, Boboli Gardens, Piti Palace and the Uffici.

<Content>Great stay, but jaded rooms. We stayed at the Silla at he end of May and had a great time. The location of the hotel is perfect, across the river from the crush of the tourist centre, but stll only a few minutes stroll into the thick of things.The rooms are a good size, with decent bathrooms, and everything is spotless. It does all have a slightly jaded feel - if a modern boutique look is what you are after, you may be dissapointed. This is only a small quibble though. The staff team there are unfailingly helpful and friendly, and the terrace (a first floor balcony, not on the actual roof) was great. We had (a fairly average) breakfast there, and drinks in the evenings before we went out for dinner.All in all, it was good price for a clean comfortable hotel in a lovely part of town.

<Content>Ideal place... We stayed at the Silla for 3 nights in a 4th floor room at the front of the hotel overlooking the trees/river/breakfast terrace.Staff were friendly and efficeint.Room was a decent size, quaintly decorated. It was quiet, we noticed very little noise from outside.Bathroom (shower no bath) was perfectly adequate.Brerakfast (tea/coffee/hot choc., pastries, meats, cheeses, eggs, rolls, etc) was good, lovely to sit on the terrace.Situation of hotel was excellent, about 5 mins walk from Ponte Vecchio. Highlights of Florence for us : ...steps to top of dome on cathedral, where there are amazing views and the added bonus, half way up, of going round the inside of the dome where you can see inside the cathedral....Boboli gardens. Go to the entrance above the Silla to get in easily....Pitti Palace with wonderful art, state rooms, etc....'Golden View Open Bar' where we had a brilliant meal right in the window looking at the Ponte Vecchio....Piazzale Michelangelo with best views of the city and bridges over the Arno.All in all we loved Florence and were happy with the Silla.

<Content>A pleasant oasis in Florance The third week in May in Florence was unusually hot, and after days spent in crowded streets, museums and churches, it was always a relief to limp across the Pont Alle Grazie to our temporary home at the Silla -- a quiet, cool and pleasant oasis. The staff was particularly helpful with museum and dinner reservations, even assistance finding a hotel room in Sienna. Perhaps best of all: breakfast on the flower-scented terrace overlooking the Arno. We鈥檒l definitely go back.

<Content>Great Location, Hard Beds We really liked everything about the Hotel Silla except the beds. The location is great. Close to everything you want to see, but in a quiet area. The staff at the desk were EXTREMELY helpful. The terrace where breakfast was served was beautiful with flowers in bloom. Our only complaint was that the beds were very hard. We had difficulty sleeping and woke up feeling bruised.

<Content>My stay at the Silla Hotel I stayed at the Silla Hotel for 2-1/2 weeks and was very happy with the experience. The location was perfect for me because it was near bus transport and was in a neighborhood that I am familiar with because it is slightly off the tourist track yet filled with interesting places. The staff was always very accommodating and helpful. The terrace was a lovely place to sit and read or draw, or just enjoy the view of the Arno river. I would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Absoletly loved Silla We loved the hotel for the following reasons: 1. Great location - it's walking distance to the historic center of Florance and yet very quitely situated by the river Arno. 2. The room was quite large ( the building is an old palazo renovated for a hotel ) with a view of the Duomo. Veryclean and well maintained. The shower was a very good size too. 3. The breakfast ( included in the room rate ) is excellent so you can skip lunch. 4. The Internet is complimentary - you can use their laptop at the reception lobby - very convenient.  5. The staff is extremely polite, friendly and everyonespeaks very good english. They make you feel like at home.We loved it. We have been in lots of hotels around the worldand we never felt so welcomed.Once again, if you are planning a trip this hotel would be a great choice. I would highly recommended and if we ever go back to Florance we know where to stay - Hotel Silla.

<Content>Second Visit This was our second visit to the Silla and it confirmed the quality of the hotel. Pleasant staff, comfortable room, a location a bit away from the action but for many that is a plus. The breakfast was also good (for Italy). The only minus was the toilet built into the shower stall 鈥?perhaps some people would find that 鈥渒inky鈥?鈥?but we did not.

<Content>Noisy place! The Silla is located in the Oltrarno (a plus) but quite far to the East in case you are looking for more a central location. It is an easy walk over a bridge. The problems begin with sleeping at night. Its rooms face a back street which is very busy and loud. If you close the windows there is no A/C which makes it hot at night. I found this the worst part of our stay. The breakfast was very nice and the staff aims to please, as positives. The neighborhood is frequented by young single Florentines with motorcycles. Considering they eat dinner late...at 9 PM...and party afterwards, it means the noise continues for hours...The other problem was the room lighting.All the lamps use very low wattage so it was extremely difficult to read in bed. Then, the towel bar fell off in the bathroom...is this a3 star hotel and should it be costing 160 Euros????

<Content>Old fashion charm in a peaceful location close to all attractions. We were looking for a nice hotel located at walking distance of main attactions but in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. In the last years Florence has become very hectic with what seems thousands of motor bikes crisscrossing in all directions. We had hoped to be out of those noises and pollution.Hotel Silla, on the left bank of the River Arno opposite Santa Croce,the famous XIII Century square and church where Michelangelo and Dante are buried was ideal for us. The hotel is located on the upper floors of a charming XV palazzo. The elevator opens to a beautiful Rennaissance courtyard.Our room faced a small tree lined square, the Arno flowing behind it.We walked everywhere, except when we arrived to the train station. Wewere going to take a taxi, but the hotel advised us to take bus 23, so we did and in ten minutes the bus left us a few feet away from the hotel. We took note that they have a convenient garage in case we drive into Florence next time.Our room was ample, furniture was of good quality, lots of those old fashioned Italian towels, bed was extremely confortable, and each night they would put impeccable white mats on the floor at each side of the bed.Bedspreads match the chairs upholstery. Good heating, a.c, and a deskwith its chair, as well as a reading arm chair. Lots of lamps. It wasa very nicely appointed room. Was the design of the uphoistery materials modern and fashion's lastcry? Probably not, but it was classic, of good quality and impeccably maintained. IF you add to these old fashioned details a very nice buffet breakfast, with fresh oj, fresh bread and croissants, good ham, cheeses, frutis, cereales, eggs etc and capuccinos made to order you can picture that we were in a place that cared for its guests, providing good service.Indeed the front desk was extremely helpful, I lost some important papers while visiting the Uffici and the Hotel front desk clerk found them by calling the right places.Was I happy!! We all rejoiced! They were as happy as we were, it was a great feeling!!Breakfast was served in an elegant dinning room facing the Arno, in the Summer I was told by the waitress that it is served on a spacious second-floor outdoor terrace also looking the Arno. There is a bar, for an occasional drink. At 100 euros with breakfast included, we reserved directly, everyday we reminded each other, what a great buy the Silla turned out to be. They also have free internet, and if you wish you can take a laptop they have for guests to your room at no charge.

<Content>Hotel Silla is the perfect place to stay, when visiting Florence. We arrived after a long day on the train from Bolzano. We were hauling skiis, boots and large suitcases. The first thing the staff did was to relieve us of all our luggage. The front desk checked us in speedily. We asked for suggestions for a close restaurant and were given excellent choices with directions. We left for Siena two days later. We were returning to Hotel Silla, after our stay in Siena. We asked if they could try to arrange a bus tour of the Chianti region, and a walking tour of Florence for us. Upon our return, we found both tours had been arranged. Typical of the Hotel Silla was the call to arrange a taxi to take us to the airport at the end of our stay. They made the arrangement, but then they needed to call again , to make certain the taxi could accommodate our skiis. We always had a smile when our coffee was brought to our table in the morning, and a smile and a good morning as we passed the cleaning staff in the hallway. As you can see, we would recommend Hotel Silla to our friends. I hope we can stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Silla for 6 nights in March 2007  were very pleased. We were on the top floor  had a very large room even by US standards. There was even an extra single bed in the room. The bathroom was also very large  everything was immaculately clean. There were lots of drawers  even lots of hangers! The bed was quite comfortable  not too hard. Extra pillows  blankets were in the room. There is safety deposit box in the room as well as a mini bar. The cable TV has CNN  BBC. They also have free wireless internet connection which worked very well. The breakfast was included  was served in a very attractive breakfast room. In the summer breakfast is on the very large patio overlooking the Arno. Breakfast was great with meats, cheese, scrambled eggs, cereal, yogurt  fresh fruit. There were lots of rolls  bread. Beverages included juices, tea, coffee  hot chocolate.The hotel is very tastefully decorated with antiques everywhere and lots of wonderful art work hanging throughout the hotel. There is a bar with a nice sitting area  from here you go out onto the patio/veranda. . Our 1st night at the hotel we had a glass of wine  sat outside. (It was warm when we first got there) The location is fabulous. It is across the river from the Uffizi  is a very easy walk to all of the central part of Florence. We only took the bus once  that was up the hill to Piazza Michelangelo. It was a very short walk down to the hotel. By the way be sure to go to Piazza Michelangelo as the view is spectacular! There are lots of restaurants close to the hotel  a convenience store almost next door.You enter the hotel through a court yard  the lobby is on the 2nd floor (1st floor in Europe).There is a small elevator up to the lobby but you do need to go up 1 or to steps to get to the elevator, There is also a small elevator form the lobby level to the other floors. They will help with the luggage if needed .They also have a garage for parking but we returned our rental car when we arrived. We booked our room directly with the hotel using the internet  got a discount because of the 6 night stay. They have secure site  they responded very quickly to our inquiry.I highly recommend this hotel  hope that we will be able to stay there again.

<Content>Great value in Florence Hotel Silla, located in the quiet Oltrarno, is a short 10 minute walk to the hustle and bustle of Santa Croce. Our room was extra large, facing a small street behind the hotel. I was informed river view rooms were smaller (I didn't see them). Furnishings are standard modern hotel, clean and well-maintained with a good-sized bathroom. The breakfast buffet was more than adequate--typical of the region. Hotel staff is friendly, helpful and efficient. Overall, a very nice option in a 3-star hotel with good amenities.

<Content>Great choice in Florence My wife and I spent part of our honeymoon in Florence, and we chose the Silla because it offered a good off-season rate for a 3-star hotel. It's located directly across the Arno River from Santa Croce, so it's an easy walk across the nearby bridge to all the action of central Florence. Our room was spacious and comfortable, and the housekeeping staff did a good job of keeping it clean. Our window looked out over the river and we could just see the Duomo on the left side, so it was quite romantic. There was some street noise, but nothing excessive. Breakfast was decent but tried a little too hard to provide some American-style offerings, not surprising since the majority of the other guests we saw seemed to be English-speaking. We would definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>Go to Florence, Stay at the Silla Hotel! My wife and I stayed in several hotels in Florence before finding the Silla. After our first visit (2000?) we have never gone anywhere else. We travel to Florence every year and spend 3 - 4 days each time. There is so much to see and study that it makes no sense to try and do it all in one go. The Silla is spacious and extremely clean. It is not right in the middle of the city so it tends to be more quiet. For us it is a very convenient walk away from the Duomo, which makes it pretty central to what we want to do.Do not plan on large lunches. Once you have the Silla breakfast you can make do with street food until supper time. This has led us to fantastic lunch shops all over Florence....standup places where you can get great meals for a few Euros.It would be wrong to end this review without a statement about the people of the Silla. They are warm, kind people who do everything they can to help the traveler...in as many languages as there are in Europe, or so it seems!

<Content>Good service at Hotel Silla My wife and I stayed 4 nights, and found the location to be great for seeing all of the tourist sights, finding shopping, and food in Florence. Very close to Ponte Vecchio. The staff at the hotel were nice and tried to answer all of our questions, they even allowed us to use one of their computers to check  send email. We somehow missed one wake up call, but that was our only problem during our stay. The nightclub next door can be a little loud at night, but after an exhausting day of walking around town you hardly notice. The continental breakfast provided is also a nice touch.

<Content>Perfect place to stay in Florence My husband and I stayed at the Silla Oct.11-14, 2006. My daughter and I had stayed there eight years ago so I booked directly with the hotel. It's a wonderful, friendly place. The rooms are clean and well appointed and each one seems to be a little different. From its location just across the Arno and one bridge down from the Ponte Vecchio we could walk everywhere. The little park in front is a noise buffer and quite pleasant to look at from the terrace. The breakfast buffet was very good and the breakfast room is most pleasant. I would highly recommend the Silla for one night, but especially for several if wishing to explore Florence.

<Content>Great location The Silla was in a great location for walking to all the sites - Pitti Palace, Boboli Gardens, Ponte Vecchio, Uffizi gallery and other museums, the Duomo and churches, markets, and upscale shopping. We walked all day for the 3 days we were in Florence - not a place to have a car. The hotel was quiet - set back from the street on the other side of a small park that runs along the Arno River. The hotel has an elevator, which is not found at all small hotels, and was a big help since the lobby and hotel rooms start on the second floor. The staff were friendly and helpful - made good recommendations for dining and placed reservations. Breakfast was good especially if you like cappucino and croissants filled with chocolate, vanilla custard, or peach preserves! Fresh fruit, cheese, ham, eggs that you can put in hot water appliance for soft or hard boiling also. When the weather is nice (our last day only) breakfast is on a beautiful terrace filled with flower pots. The rooms were adequate - nothing fancy and frankly need updating - but clean and comfortable - we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The price was good when we compared it to other places we considered - we were very satisfied with our choice.

<Content>Pleasant hotel with air-conditioning Hotel Silla was an older hotel in need of a few updates, but still clean. The rooms were absolutely enormous, but the bed and especially the pillows were as hard as bricks. We went and bought a few 5 Euro pillows at the street fair. (aka: bring a pillow from home.) However, the staff was very nice, providing us with a map and even umbrellas when it rained. The breakfast was an extensive buffet, and you could even hard-boil eggs. There was also a beautiful flowered patio for eating breakfast. The hotel is located on the other side of the Arno River from the main attractions, but these could be reached by a very pleasant walk along the river.

<Content>Would Certainly Do it Again! Hotell Silla is a very lovely hotel in a section of the city that is a bit away from the hustle-bustle (we viewd that as positive) and a very manageable walk to all of the sights. We had 2 rooms for our family of 5 (3 boys aged 20, 18, and 15). The rooms were well appointed, spacious, and immaculate (I am extremely fussy when it comes to cleanliness). The staff was most accommodating, ranging from booking reservations via email in advance to the museums, to helping us with some telephone communication problems concerning the next leg of our trip. Mrs. Silla was takes great pride in her property. If we ever have the opportunity to vist Florence again, Hotel Silla is where we would stay.

<Content>Excellent experience at Hotel Silla My wife and I very much enjoyed our 4 night stay at Hotel Silla. The hotel is extremely well located just across the Arno and less than 10 minute walk from the Uffizzi. The area was quiet and the park in front of the hotel was very convenient.The property was very clean throughout and well maintained while we were there. The air conditioning was quite effective as well.The front desk staff in particular were very helpful. They were quick and sincerely accomodating when asked to recommend and make bookings at the local museums and restaurant. All of their recommendations were excellent.One touch which my wife really enjoyed is that our room (#31) had a rocking chair. The rooftop terrace for breakfast was very pleasant, but the buffet could be improved.At 120 euro per night, we felt that it was a good value compared to the other hotels we stayed at during our two week trip to Italy.

Our room was gorgeous and impeccable, the terrace on which we ate breakfast every morning was beautiful, the food was great, and the staff could not have been more helpful. The location is superb, south of the Arno and therefore away from the hubbub of downtown but a very pleasant 10-15 minute walk from the Ufizzi, the Piazza Signoria, Santa Croce, Ponte Vecchio, and just a bit further from the Duomo. Finally, the hotel is very reasonably priced. All in all, this place is a real find, a truly magnificent hotel.

<Content>Delightful taste of Italy We found Hotel Silla to be a wonderful respite from our tour of Florence. Housed above a 15th century palazzo, the hotel has been refurbished and the rooms are clean and fresh. The entire staff were friendly and accomodating and bent over backwards to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The hotel is a mid-range hotel, not a luxury hotel, yet definitely a delightful taste of Italy. It is located just a block south of the Arno river and is an easy walk to the Ponte Vecchio, the Uffuzi and Duomo. We also enjoyed walking through the neighborhoods south of the hotel and getting a sense of what the non-tourist section of Florence is really like. We had breakfast outdoors every morning on the veranda. It was simple but delicious with homemade breads and cereals and of course, expresso. The staff up front helped us book reservations at the Uffizi and the Academy so we could avoid the long lines. They also helped us at our departure figure out how to get our rental car and drive outside the city (on our way to other parts of Tuscany).  The hotel is lovely, clean, well kept and will be our destination on our next trip to Florence. It is also well priced for a night's stay and breakfast. We were extremely pleased.

<Content>yuck This location is not terribly convenient, plus it is overlooking the main highway that runs along the arno - very noisy and no air conditioning, so it was roast or listen to the traffic late into the night. This area is also frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes at night. The room was terribly depressing, with fake wood furniture and inadequate lighting. I have stayed at other much nicer places in Florence and don't understand all the positive reviews.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Silla Florence, Italy Hotel SillaDate July 28th.2006Reviewer: Dr. Rune Lilleng, Oslo, NorwayTogether with my wife and our two youngest children (17 and 14)we had a one week stay at Hotel Silla in June-2006. The room nrs. were 51 and 52We had never been in Florence before. This hotel is close to all the museums you want to see. You can walk some minutes or take bus that stops outside the hotel. The staff speaks excellent english and is very serviceminded. They take care of all needs if you ask for help regarding tickets etc. The hotel is a former monestry, but is completely renovated. The rooms are large of area, with a high distance between floor and ceiling. Very good ventilation and very clean. In room 51 there was in addition to a doublebed, an extra bed behind a wall. Large, clean bathrooms.Excellent breakfast with many choices. This hotel is good value for the price. Next time in Florence, we will use this hotel !

<Content>Excellent, friendly service Hotel is on fairly quiet street, just across the Arno River from the main city, but it is within easy walking distance of major sites. Nicely florally decorated terrace for breakfast overlooking a small park is nice. Room is of reasonable size, with a comfortable bed, and nicely appointed. Major plus was the service, especially from those who manned the front desk. They were courteous, helpful, and personable no matter what the request (and not only with us), and the restaurant recommendations they made were excellent. Slightly out of the mainstream, but a good place from which to base a visit to Florence.

<Content>Great location and helpful staff My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Hotel Silla as part of a 9 day excursion to Italy in late May. We selected the hotel based upon other TripAdvisor reviews and we were very pleased with our choice. The Hotel Silla is in an excellent location, on the tame side of the Arno River, just a couple of blocks from the Ponte Vecchio. It is within easy walking distance of all of the great sites in Florence.The staff was very friendly, helpful and professional. They went out of their way to help me with a problem I was having with my rental car. The hotel has a small parking garage available, which was very useful for us as we were driving from destination to destinaton in Italy.The breakfast was also a treat. The outdoor patio is situated on a terrace overlooking a small park on the river. They offered a wider variety of breakfast foods than most of the places we stayed in Italy.I have recommended the hotel to one of my business partners who will be travelling to Florence on July, and I highly recommend it to you. You will love the Hotel Silla.

<Content>very friendly and helpful The Hotel Silla was a great place to stay. Easy to book via the internet, and they even sent email offering to get us advance reservations for museums. Why stand in line when you can get an advance reservation?! We arrived early and so didn't expect our rooms to be ready. They offered to take our luggage and place them in our rooms for us. Breakfast was served on an outside terrace and they offered eggs as well as fabulous fruit and rolls. When we asked for a dinner suggestion, they offered up a great local Italian restaurant. This was the best place we stayed while we were in Italy.

<Content>Enjoyed Our Stay at Hotel Silla My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel Silla (June 3 -10, 2006) and found the hotel to be ideally located and well maintained. Our room was surprisingly large and was very clean. The hotel is a short and easy walk to the Ponte Vecchio, and there is also a closer bridge that provides an easy walk to the Ufizzi. You can walk to the Piazzale Michaelangelo, albeit it is all up hill. The staff was very friendly, accommodating, and all spoke English. They provided good restaurant recommendations and were very helpful in calling taxis. I have no complaints about our stay and would definitely stay at the Hotel Silla again.

<Content>Character and Charm Through the courtyard of an old palazzo, up one storey in the glass-sided little elevator, and you're at reception in this comfortable, friendly, informal, small hotel in the Oltrarno, in a quiet, uncrowded, residential neighborhood, a ten-minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio: near the action, but (thank Heaven) not in it. Breakfast on the spacious, flowery, shady terrace, overlooking a small park with the Arno and the rest of Florence just beyond, is as close to paradise as you're likely to get.

<Content>above average This is a very nice hotel, with a pleasant and helpful staff. The rooms are simple, but spacious and clean. We stayed in a triple room, which was quite large for European standards, although it was a little dark due to the lack of sunlight and one window without a view.The breakfasts are served on a lovely terrace in warm weather and includes a buffet of eggs, pastries,cheese, toast, and all the delicious cappuccinos one can possibly drink. The value of the hotel is a good one given the very satisfying breakfast, which exceeded other hotels we stayed in. I also liked the location of Hotel Silla. It's on a quiet, leafy street, a rarity in Florence and is about a 10 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio and right across from the Arno river.All in all, I think most people would be happy here, although , it is not a fancy hotel and some rooms and lobby lack charm, my overall experience was quite positive and I would certainly consider staying here again.

<Content>Nice hotel in good Florence location The Hotel Silla is a quiet oasis in busy Florence. It is just over the Arno from the Uffizii Gallery, yet is on a shaded square. It has a lovely entry courtyard, and a wonderful second floor patio for breakfast or afternoon drinks. The staff is excellent. The rooms were large. The only negative, in our opinion, was that the rooms were very dark. They need more lights, and lighter-colored furnishings and wall paper.

<Content>Beware room 16!!! Room 16 was horrible. The bed had saggy springs, the shower curtain had mold on it, the housekeeping staff left a Fanta I drank sit on the table for two days (I finally threw it away) and they folded up a wet bath matt and put it back on the stool under my make-up bag. Then the toilet above us ran all night - and the management said they couldn't do anything about it.Other rooms might be better, but I would NOT recommend this hotel, or stay there again. The staff were kind enough, but not enough to make me return.

<Content>Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff. I wasn't sure what to expect and was more than pleasantly suprised. The hotel is beautiful and the staff very kind, gracious and helpful. Everyone spoke fluent English and was great about assisting us with sightseeing questions. The hotel as well as our room was very clean, nicely decorated and very cozy. The hotel has a wonderful terrace which overlooks the city and we took full advantage by enjoying afternoon drinks before heading off to dinner. Hotel Silla is centrally located to the city and within walking distance of the cities center (approx. 10-15 min. walk). I would highly recommend this establishment, not just for the amenties, but also because of the wonderful and helpful people who staff this establishment.

<Content>Fabulous! Absolutely Wonderful!Hotel Silla and its staff are the most caring group of individuals that I have ever experienced! They made my first visit to the beautiful city of Florence most memorable! The staff was more than willing to help out in anyway whether it be with directions or the best venues to dine at.....and those selections were great! They were extremely helpful prior to my arrival too, doing what ever it took to have things in order! The hotel itself is darling.....well cared for as well. What a treat as well to find Mrs. Avellino Silla, the owner there as well....see is very sweet! The breakfast buffet was lovely as well along with the waitstaff. There is a lovely terrace to enjoy once after you have visited the sites and are looking to relax....it's planted with blooming flowers, which adds to the experience! What more could I say....I adored my stay here and look forward to my return trip to Florence and Hotel Silla. Ciao' Dan K.

<Content>Depressing and not clean Of the 4 hotels we visited in northern Italy, this was the one we would not recommend. Our experience was quite different from everyone else's. Rick Steves' description, which was the reason we came here, seemed to us that he never made it past the lobby, and we laughed at their brochure because it was a complete makeover of their place. Our room had a heavy musty smell like the basement archive of a university library or a storage attic at your grandma's, and combined with the Florence sewage smell from the bathroom drain, it was such a drag to come back to this room every time. I have no known allergies, but every time I entered the room my sinsuses would get stuffed up. We opened the windows, which overlooked the terrace, but would then get the cigarette smoke from the bellhop guy who needed to smoke every 10 minutes or the conversation of guests hanging out on the terrace.The bed, bathroom, and linens were clean, but the upholstered chair in our room was badly stained with dirt on the arm rests and seat. I used those extra dishtowels to cover it so I could sit on it.The bathroom door did not quite fit within its entire path, and seemed to swell even more as our stay continued (it was warm and a bit humid), so opening the door past 30 degrees required us to make a god-awful scraping sound that probably woke up the entire floor.Was it just us or did no one else notice that there was fluorescent lighting in the bathroom and the bedroom? It felt like an unrenovated Travelodge from the 70's. Also the pink cabbage rose wallpaper and blue polyester bedspreads and very worn furniture became eyesores. Any one of these things would not have bothered us, but the collective experience of all these environmental assaults together was just too much. We were too tired from jetlag to ask for another room, repack, move (and was afraid we would just end up with the same). I should give credit to the staff who were all very nice and helpful, and breakfast was reasonably good, served in a beautiful dining hall. Location did guarantee more quiet at night than on the other side of the river. And apparently there is a nonsmoking floor, which was also important to us. I wonder if the price premium in Florence just necessitates spending 200-250 Euro instead of 175-200. But I paid less in Venice, which I expected to be more expensive, and received much more. I hope no one ends up in the room we had! If the nicest part of the hotel is the entrance staircase and elevator, look somewhere else. Wish someone had told me this!

<Content>A bit noisy, but very charming There were 6 of us who stayed at the Silla for several days in April. (My husband and I had never been to Italy before, so we have no basis for comparison with any other hotels.)The Hotel Silla is very clean, very charming, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was a convent at one time, hence the many narrow halls, arched ceilings and little rooms. You feel like you are walking thru a castle when you are just going from the lift to your room!We were quite comfortable in our room, and the bathroom was fine (shower, no tub).We were given clean towels and soap, every single day, and the bed was made every day. Our room looked out on the river, and as there is a busy street between, it could get noisy at night. We just used earplugs and had no problems sleeping.The breakfast is yummy! It is buffet-style, but the hard-working ladies will bring you coffee, hot tea, hot chocolate, all you have to do is ask. The food offered was two kinds of dry cereal, scrambled eggs, slices of ham and cheese, every sort of roll/croissant you can imagine, bread, little wedges of cheese, jams, honey and butter, fresh fruit (one morning there was a huge bowl of fresh, sliced strawberries), yogurt (plain and fruit), milk and 2 kinds of juice, usually orange and grapefruit. There is a microwave to heat things up in. It was hard not to stuff myself!The hotel is within walking distance of several very nice restaurants, and several little shops selling everything from fine quality leather goods to Pinocchios to postcards. It is also walking distance to the Pitti Palace, and on the other side of the river, the Uffizi, etc.I was just 3 months out of a total knee replacement and was able to get everywhere (used a cane) with little trouble.The staff was also very kind. Every night, my husband would take a ziplock bag down to the bar area and ask for ice cubes, then bring it back up to the room so I could ice my knee! They had no problem with that.We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Silla and would stay there again.

<Content>Nice hotel Hotel Silla is nicely located in the middle a triangle made up by the city center, Pitti Palace and Piazzo Michelangelo. The best way to explore the city is by foot, so location means a lot. On the other hand, if you do not wish to move around and want step right onto a shopping street or the main sights right in the cit centre from your hotel, don't choose Silla. But if you like to stroll around the city and expect to see the myriad of different places, then Sillas location is ideal.Other reviews at TripAdvisor had also raised our hopes quite a lot for the hotel. Compared with this expectation, the hotel turned out to be quite neutral instead of exceptional. Interior decoration is minimal, hallways remind mostly of dorms and rooms are very simple and spartan. Our room was towards the Arno-river, which was nice, except that the traffic from busy street along the river echoed to the room throughout the night - light sleepers be aware. Hotel staff was friendly, but nothing out of the ordinary or what you might expect from any service. Also, there is no restaurant at the hotel, which isn't a big deal really, Florence is filled with nice places to eat, but still, no such service exist. So would we return to Silla? Not automatically without looking for options first, but Silla is simply nice. Good hotel, but not exceptional.

<Content>Very nice indeed Well recommended. The hotel was well located and our room had a view of the Arno, the Duomo and the Bell Tower. Once the trees bloom much of that may be obscured but trees too are a lovely view. There is a lovely terrace that we didn't use because it was still a little cool outside.Breakfast was simple though filling and the cappuccino was fabulous. We were close enough to walk to everything. A short walk to the Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi and a pleasant stroll to the Duomo. (I should note that we like to walk)The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Their restaurant recommendations were great and led us to some great choices. Though the neighborhood is quiet there is a restaurant on the same block. We went there out of laziness since it was nearby and were pleasantly surprised to learn that it was full of locals - our litalian was handy here.The room is pleasant and the windows are quite large and they open like french doors. With the iron railing it was like having a balcony. Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. We certainly recommend the Silla. Church bells rang as we arrived and departed, coincidence?? (they never woke us though)We had listened to some Italian language CDs before our trip. While not necessary it made our trip that much mroe pleasant as the Italians seemed to appreciate our having made the effort.Also - consider taking up the Italian habit of long lunches. It is a great way to rest between vigorous sightseeing morning and afternoon. Then you can end the day with a light dinner and vino de la casa.Ciao.

The room was clean and comfortable and the location of the hotel was very convenient. Also, the breakfast was included which consisted of plenty of options (although not an American breakfast, I surely didn't go hungry!) and the lady in the breakfast room always had our American Coffee with Milk on the way when we came in. Great staff, great place...Wouldn't hesitate to go back -- as often as I can manage it!

<Content>Hotel Silla still Wonderful after 20 years We first stayed at the Hotel Silla 20 years ago. Then it was called Hotel Pension Silla. It had been recommended by my daughter's friend. We loved it then! I just returned from 30 days in Italy and the Hotel Silla is still one of the best. Lovingly maintained by the same owners, my spacious room had a great view of the river and the Duomo in Florence. It's an easy walk or inexpensive taxi ride to all the major Florentine attractions.You can depend on friendly, high quality service. I stayed in 3 to 5 star hotels and this one was underrated. Book the Silla with confidence!

<Content>Really Nice Place Four of us stayed at the Hotel Silla in February. We found it to be clean and well maintained. The bathrooms were spotless. The staff was very helpful, attentive and full of good restaurant suggestions.The places they recommended felt authentic and the food was always good.The hotel was very well located from our point of view; easy walking distance to the Duomo and the Pontevecchio. The front of the hotel overlooks a smallpark and the Arno. For us it was special.Breakfasts were similar to most other nice hotels. Yogurts, sweet rolls, granolas, cappuchino. Plenty foran adequate start to the day.Try getting a room that looks over the Arno. Some of the other rooms open onto a narrow street where the reverberation of scooters can sometimes be disturbing.We came to like the place and would stay again upona return to Florence.

<Content>Excellent, quiet, bargain We stayed for four nights in October, 2005. It was great to have somewhere away from the crowds and noise of the historical center, but it was still easy to walk anywhere we wanted to go (Uffizzi in 7 minutes, Santa Croce in 5 minutes). If you go aound the corner there are nice little tratorias and markets where you can eat for less or buy some bread, wine, cheese to take back to the room.The staff was perfectly helpful and attentive to our needs (except that I did have to teach the bar man how to make a martini). Our room was billed as Double superior (E185) and was roomy by Italian standards and comfortable with windows overlooking the terrace and the park. This was our third trip to Florence and we decided that the Silla is our preferred hotel now. The owner lives on site and keeps her eye on everything.

<Content>Definitely to be recommended. We stayed at the Hotel Silla in August 2005. This lovely old hotel is in a pleasant setting just south of the Arno. We found the staff warm and friendly, and the hotel, including our spacious room (room 31) was kept extremely clean.Breakfast is served on the open terrace, except on chilly mornings, and overlooks the Piazza Demidof. The Arno can be glimpsed through the tall trees which grow in the Piazza.We felt that the hotel was also very well positioned, about half a mile from the Ponte al Grazzie and the north bank of the Arno. The Piazza Michaelangelo, with its fantastic views over Florence, is not far away. A hard climb up several steps, but well worth it for the views. A highpoint of our holiday in more ways than one.

<Content>Very good hotel for a reasonable price Hotel Silla is a pensione that is recommended by Rick Steves in one of his books. It is very clean with nicely sized rooms and very helpful staff. All of the staff that we encountered spoke very good English and gave excellent restaurant recommendations, as well as other helpful hints. The location is excellent, across the river from all of the crowds and noice, but close enough to walk everywhere. The furthest attraction is the Academia, which is a 20 min. walk. I recommend seeing it early in the morning, so that the streets aren't crowded during your walk. The breakfast was good with tasty bread, yogurt, cheese, fruit, cereal, and an excellent cappuccino. The only less than great item at the buffet were the eggs, which looked like they were made from a powdered mix or something. But with all of the other good food, I didn't miss them. All in all, this is a good value hotel in a nice neighborhood of Florence.

<Content>You've found the "One" If you're anything like us, you've been researching hotel after hotel, wondering what reviews you should believe, and how you are going to pick the hotel you'll be staying at during your time in Florence. Well, look no further, in Hotel Silla you have found the one.We stayed at the Hotel Silla for one week in May. The hotel is in a great, safe location. Our room was HUGE (not the norm in Europe, as we discovered), well appointed, and comfortable. The hotel itself is walking distance to all the must-sees and some sights that are exceptional though not-so-famous.Massimo (mentioned in many other reviews) lives up to his reputation as host extraorinairre-- the man goes above and beyond the expectations of his job and makes each guest at the hotel feel as if they were staying with a member of their (Italian!) family. Hotel Silla was truly everything we hoped it would be, and after our experience, we wouldn't stay anywhere else.

<Content>Clean with good location My husband and I stayed at Hotel Silla for 2 nights in September. Based on some of the reviews, I was concerned about the location but it was a great location. It was quiet and a very quick walk over the bridge to all the action. The hotel was very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was more than enough. The AC worked too and was very much needed in September! We would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again ourselves if ever lucky enough to return to Florence.

<Content>good choice in florence We stayed here for 1 night in May 2004. Easy to get to if driving. On the less touristy side of the river but easy to walk to all big attractions. Parking available at the hotel, which was good. Room was fine and clean, but nothing spectacular. Breakfast was very good and front desk was very nice, as well.
