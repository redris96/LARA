<Content>dirty noisy and with fleas... We arrived on a Wednesday and left first thing on Thursday: what a horrible place!!! Strange things happened: we needed to pay in advance for the full period we wanted to stay. We started discussing, but that was the only way that was acceptable to them. But to me this was very strange to pay for a week in advance鈥?but we were tired after two days traveling鈥?so we wanted to go to our room and sleep鈥?br/>And when we finally went to our room there was no hot water in the shower. The room stank, was not clean, I found rubbish behind the curtains, the floor gave you a feeling that it wasn鈥檛 cleaned in quite some time. The tv remote controler was not working, but not replaced. Internet was not working properly and at some rooms not at all鈥?br/>And it gets even worse when I was trying to do my email, I was sitting on the bed, and all the sudden I started scratching鈥?I could not find what was causing it鈥?but saw little swellings on my armes and legs鈥?br/>So next morning we wanted out!Then we had a big discussion to get our money back: we only could get a part back, and we took our loss. But maybe my story will be a warning for you....

<Content>Great Price-Quality Ratio Stayed at the Taylor Hotel one week right before Christmas 2007. As mentioned, the quality-price ration is perfect. You could not possibly find a better room for the same price. Safe, quite clean, no disturbance, friendly and helpful staff and, what was the most important thing in my case, so near to all the main SF curiosities. I would definitely recommend it if you need a roof over your head for a short period of time.

<Content>avoid it! I didn't expect much, when I came to the Taylor, but it underbid everything: It is noisy, noisy and noisy, so I couldn't do, what for I booked the private room in the first place: sleeping. Avoid it!

<Content>Decent hotel for the price and in a GREAT location!!! A co-worker and I were in San Fran for an interpreter convention that was held at the San Francisco Marriott (55 4th st). Rooms were way more than we could afford for the week long trip. After much on line looking, I ran across the Taylor web site. I was not impressed w/ the looks but LOVED the price (it was less than $60 a night for two double beds, a private bathroom, and a simple continental breakfast). I was worried about the Taylor due to all the negative reviews but felt  we will be in workshops all day, all we need is a bed and a shower...we should be fine. Much to our surprise, the Taylor was BETTER than we expected! The hotel manager was fantastic! He was able to answer every question we had and recommended some great places for eating and drinking. (There is a great place called the Cellar just around the corner w/ cheap drinks before 9:00...like $1 coronas). The hotel is w/in walking distance of everything needed (laundry, walgreens, union square...even grocery stores IF you are up to walking a little over a mile...one way). And what's great the rooms have a small microwave and fridge in every room so IF you walk to Trader Joe's you have a place to keep your groceries AND heat up food (another bonus to staying at the Taylor).I will admit there are MUCH nicer hotels in the area but the Taylor has everything you need if you are on a budget! THe rooms are clean, but are old. The bathroom was clean but has thick paint on the walls. It is true that the hotel smells like indian food...often, but it was never bothersome. We never had to wait more than 30 seconds to be buzzed in...even at 2:00 in the morning (the doors are always locked and you have to ring a buzzer to be let in). Yes, the elevator is old and hard to use...we only used it when we were lugging our luggage up to our room and down when it was time to leave. (There is a sign on the front of the elevator about being charged $25 if you leave the gate open...we were very good about closing the gate behind us)! I would stay at the Taylor again w/out hesitation!! If you are looking for a budget hotel w/ decent accommdations, the Taylor is for you. If you don't plan on spending much time in your hotel room...the Taylor is for you. I would not recommend this hotel for a family w/ young children and If you want a classy hotel, stay away and shop around the corner. But bottom line, the Taylor is a decent hotel and I plan on returning! (I took pictures and will add at a later time).

<Content>Just like staying with friends. The indian family that owns and operates this hotel is reminiscent of our stay in India. Visiting India is like visiting friends at home for the personal care they take. Ashi not only knows everything there is to know about the neighborhood of Taylor, but is anxious to share it. Close to Union Square, this is the place to stay and the rate makes it possible to stay twice as long. Forget the hostels nearby, Taylor is a much better place.

<Content>Great bargain! Taylor Hotel was just as many have described. I walked in the smallish lobby at midnight and was underwhelmed. However, the next day I realized that it is very close to everything I needed. It was clean and had some remodeling in the bathroom. It was exactly what I would expect out of a hotel this price in Downtown SF. There are much ritizier hotels, yes, but you will pay. The owners were nice and helpful, kids were nosy, and the place was safe. There were a couple of long term residents that were especially friendly but I enjoyed the free internet service when it was unoccupied and I liked the continental breakfast. But don't be fooled it is just prepackaged donuts and some coffee. It was a nice start to my morning and I took a couple for the trip to the airport so all in all I would recommend staying here if you are on a budget!

<Content>Great budget hotel! Hello fellow travelers my name is Darryl and i was recently on a short trip to San Francisco to scout and rate budget hotels for my company.The taylor hotel is located in the greater downtown area, is within reasonable walking distance(4-5 blocks) of the commercial downtown area, and only 2 blocks from union square.Before you read the bulk of my review, I should state that i went there as a a sort of secret shopper. I did not announce my visit, nor did i at any point inform any staff of my purpose there in order to experience the hotel as a normal traveler would.As I stated before it was a budget hotel, so the fact that there werent many amenities to speak of wasnt surprising. But I was surprised to see that there was free wifi internet on the premises, and a microwave and mini fridge in my room.Housekeeping is almost non existant, but the staff did help me whenever i needed towels or any of the like.The staff are all rather nice and extremely helpful. I had the pleasure to interact with them and when i asked for reccomendations as to what to do in the city the provided some san francisco insider knowledge and i thoroughly enjoyed my self at the places they recommendedThe area was great and although it does border a rough neighborhood, I encountered no problems at all during any point in my stay here.Overall i thought it was a great hotel and would recommend it to anyone travelling on a budget.I hope this review helped, and happy travelling!

<Content>Best Value Great place for travelling cheap. My single medium-sized room was $70 and relatively clean compared to hostels I've stayed at for a similar price. The hotel is on the border of a nice area but feels very safe. There's also a great crepe place right across the street.

<Content>Stay Here Only if Desperate I stayed in downtown SF at a hotel called Taylor Hotel. It was nothing much to write home about. It was in disrepair. The rooms were spartan and seemed to have been painted 20 years ago and not since. The street noise was so loud that I had to use earplugs to sleep. The bathtub lining was eroding away. There is no daily maid service so you have to reuse your towels and make your own bed. There is no air conditioning but luckily the SF nights were cool. The pros included central location, free WiFi, in room mini-fridge and microwave. The staff lives in the hotel and I didn't have much contact beyond checkin. I would not recommend this place if you have alternatives. I paid $70/night + tax.

<Content>Bad...Real Bad Just like the other reviews; it was bad, real bad. The room was stuffy, and there was no thermostat. If you opened the window you had very loud noise from a late-nite bar located in the same block coming in along with the noise from the restless natives walking by. Since the pillows provided were completely flat, I asked for additional ones. After the second request I received the pillows, at the front desk door, and had to take them to my room myself. Oh, and those extra pillows? I am not making this up - had blood stains on them that obviously could not be washed out. Room service was, literally, non-existent. The bedding was never changed along with the trash can in the bathroom over the five nites I stayed there. I think this place is some kind of flop house for the low-income set. The walls and woodwork are dirty and battered, as if from forty to fifty years of abuse, and everything looked like it was painted by a crew of nine year olds. The hotel clerk greets you as he emerges through a filthy blanket hanging in a doorway leading from an equally filthy back room. There is no phone or clock in the room. Thats the bulk of the bad news. Heres a couple of positives: you get a televsion and internet access, hot water worked (thru ancient plumbing) and, with all the filth, I expected to see roaches or mice or the like, but saw none.

<Content>Terrible place to stay Taylor hotel was really bad Disgusting place to stay , smelly , unclean , the manager was just sleezy ,I was looking for a good value place to stay in San Francisco the Taylor Hotel advertised itself on the internet as a cheap alternative to hostels and I booked a private room there , when I got there I immediately realized what a mistake I had made , it was filthy and smelly, I figured I would stay the first night and cancel the remainining nights, but the manager tells me I have to pay for all 5 nights even if I leave and he did try to charge but I stopped the payment by calling by credit card company.I sugest that if you want cheap decent accomodation try one of the real hostels in San Francisco, I ended up going to a real hostel and it was great.

<Content>Ridiculous Cancellation Policy If you have had the misfortune of making a reservation at this hotel, perhaps you might want to cancel it and get a better room at Stratford or at Maxwell. They are both also close to Union Square and my experiences with them have been way better.Management at this hotel is at best sneaky. While most hotels have a one-day cancellation policy, this one has a whole litany of LAWS regarding cancellation, and at the end of it, you will lose ALL YOUR MONEY.At most hotels, you get to stay for one day, and change if you don't like it. NOT AT THIS ONE! They'll take all your money anyway if for some reason, you can't stay all the way.Asked for a reason why, the best they could come up with is, we don't charge a lot and that that's the way we do things. What utter bull. Other hotels who charge just as little have much better management and rooms.ALSO, this hotel is in the TENDERLOIN! Worst neighborhood in San Francisco. Unless you're a heroin junkie, you wouldn't want to be staying at this hellhole of a hotel.

<Content>Beware - Budget means Dirty, No Hot Water, unfriendly staff The money saved was not worth it. The hotel lobby was dirty, the room was dirty. The staff was unfriendly. There are no telephones, so you can't call or be reached at the hotel. The worst is that the hot water is only slightly warm. This was the case every day at all hours and not a temporary thing. There are no lamps in the rooms. Only one end table. Ripped and stained chairs. The cieling lights are stained with dirt. Filthy. Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't.

<Content>Not bad In need of cheap accommodation we came across the Taylor Hotel and having read the mixed reviews, we thought we鈥檇 give it the benefit of the doubt. Coming towards the end of a month long trip in the USA a room with some home comforts and a nice bed would have been nice. Our room was quite basic but it was clean and did the job although the shower set the smoke alarm off, something which the management seem used to. And it鈥檚 true what you read about the curry smells although we couldn鈥檛 smell it once inside the room.

<Content>Steer Clear of Taylor Don't stay here! Walking in the door was enough to turn us off - smell of curry everywhere. The room looked hideous. The management were rude. There are better budget hotels around than this one. We didn't stay and had to bear the cost of our 4 night reservation. We said we would stay 1 night as it was 10pm when we arrived but the management said they didn't 'do 1 night'! Of course we ended up paying for it even though we weren't allowed to stay. I still don't get it - why can't you stay when you have to pay anyway? We stayed on Bush Street at the Grant Hotel - much much better! Be warned about the Taylor. I believed some of the 'kind' reviews on this site and went ahead and booked it - don't be caught!

<Content>Cheap but no cheer We stayed for two nights but if I had my way I would have booked out and bore the cost elsewhere. My husband is too sympathetic to people who own small business establishments. I have to say the owners were nice and helpful, and no doubt need to make a living. The location is great, but I am afraid there are lots of buts..... our room had a bad odour - a scented candle (purchased by me) was of great helpthe carpet was sticky - advice, wear shoes at all timesBasically the place needs to be renovated. If this is not viable then a short term plan should be put in place. Otherwise no one will come back....

<Content>Awful hotel - Rude managment This hotel is filthy, poorly managed, and complete with extremely rude customer service. The room came with an ungodly odor, the bathroom lights did not work, the refrigerator was not only foul, but didn't even work, cigarette burns and moth holes in the sheets. and the worst of it is that i requested a smoking room, was never told that i was receiving a non-smoking room, and was charged an extra $150 cleaning charge upon checkout. when i protested, i was met with unspeakably rude behavior. beware!

<Content>stay somewhere else if you can! we made our resevervations for 4 days and only stayed for 2 if that tells you anything. yes, it is a great location and yes, the price is fair, but you can find better for the price, we did! we didn't even care about the 2 days they wouldn't refund us - althought he did say that he would if someone else booked the room, but how would we ever know if that happened?our advice is to only stay here if you can't find anything else. all of the other reviews are very accurate - especially about the contenental breakfast - what a JOKE! but one thing that isn't mentioned and i found very annoying was that you had to be buzzed in everytime you wanted back in to the hotel. the elevator is a little scary i'd say. so stay on the lower floors if you can. the walls are the color of cigarette tar stained white! it makes everything very dreary.the location however, is awesome. just be sure to wear your best walking shoes!

<Content>basic but great location The hotel is very basic-rooms are plain, basic in style but clean which is the main thing. don't rely on breakfast-when they say continental or swedish style- they really mean a prepacked extremely processed danish-very sweet, not great. so i recommend buying groceries as you can keep them in your fridge! However, there is tea/coffee and kettle available all day so thats great. Also, there is free internet acess all day which was a major benefit! The location was also great-5min walk from union square, lots of shops, restaurants etc nearby. a supermarket 2 min from hotel, and also a really great cafe- the taylor street cafe where you get really great cheap breakfasts! Finally, the price was very good considering the location -very cheap. So if you don't want frills, want cheap basic accomodation in great location then stay here.

<Content>Great place for extended stays! I am a single travelling nurse in need of a safe, affordable hotel near my hospital and the Taylor was perfect. The room was very clean and a refridgerator was provided at no extra cost. In addition, there is a computer available for guests to use to check email, etc. The staff was extremely friendly and took care of all my needs immediately. Its location is within convenient walking distance to many reatsurants, Union Square and the BART station. The Taylor Hotel will no doubt be my preferred place of stay for the rest of my travel assignments to the Bay area.

<Content>Great Room for the price, Friendly Family Stayed here when I went to Pride last year. Hotel is run by a very friendly family. The building is older and it shows, however, it is very clean and well maintained. The elevator worked every time I used it! The room I stayed in was very clean with a comfortable bed. It had a mini fridge and large closet with hangers. The bathroom was clean with a wonderful bathtub/shower. Consistant hot water. Great for a long soak after a long day. It did not have air conditioning but I didn't miss it, the windows opened up and let in all the fresh air I needed. A great value for the price. I will stay here again the next time I'm in San Francisco.  The neighborhood down Taylor towards Market is a little dodgy, but I had no problems. If you HAVE to walk there be sure to stay alert and make eye contact. It's all about not being caught off guard. Otherwise walk down Post. It's less scary. I was pleasantly surprised to find the hotel was close to theaters on Geary (a block away) and went to a show Saturday night before going to Castro.

<Content>Low budget hotel and better than expected After spending a week in another budget hotel in SOMA (south of Market Street) which I had endured homeless persons all over the streets, pot smoking in other rooms of the hotel, and substandard restrooms down the hall, the Hotel Tayor was a joy to stay at. Located 3 blocks west of Powell Street, Union Square and the Cable Cars, it is handy for theater and within a couple blocks of at least 6 major hotels, if you still want to feel important and well off. The Hotel Talyor is best if you plan to have a stay at least 7 days so you can use the great weekly rates. I was in two different rooms, because at check-in the manager asked if I could move later in the week to allow a group arriving later that wanted to be all on the same floor. Very polite staff, and if you ask, they will let you use their personal computer for a short time. Both rooms were above average, with bath, shower/tub combos, lots of closet space, cable TV, and mini fridges. No AC, but one room had a fan.Older elevator, but persons with wheelchairs will have a difficult time with the steps into the lobby. Don't expect the Hyatt or Westin, but expect the room to feel like staying in the spare bedroom in your brother's house.

<Content>Uphill from Union Square, good budget hotel My husband and I booked it on the internet and stayed here for 2 nights Oct 04. Not at all fancy, but at $50 (plus lots of tax) it is a good price for centrally located SF hotel. (The big hotels were experiencing a nasty strike, so smaller hotels are better choice at this time.) Re location, it is about 3-4 blocks uphill from Union Sq at Post and Taylor. If you walk on Post or Sutter St you will be fine. Downhill on Taylor takes you into very scruffy Tenderloin area, so avoid heading toward Market St from there, though eating at Original Joe鈥檚 at Taylor/Market is even worth wading through the tenderloin scene. Plan to do a lot of hill walking going back and forth from Union Square. Good location for getting around on public transport, using Union Square as your launch point. To purchase a short term bus pass, head down Post St to Powell St at Union Square. Walk down Powell to the info booth at the Muni/Bart station on Market and purchase a 1-3 day Muni pass to ride all over, including on the cable cars. We got a 3 day pass for $15鈥攁 real bargain, as 1-way on cable car is $2. We probably rode the cable cars a dozen times as well as the bus and Muni underground! Take cable cars at stops other than at the ends of the line--off hours are best. Take the Muni underground to get to various outer neighborhoods, and up and down Market Street鈥攋ust show your pass to the station agent at the booth to gain entry. The hotel itself is seedy, but will provide you with some good travel stories. A nice extended Indian or Pakistani family runs it鈥攍ittle kids around, and smell of curry makes it rather homey. We asked for an interior room, got one on 6th floor, not too noisy from street noise. Small funky old elevator. Room painted sunny yellow. TV not on cable, no room phone, no lamps. But great old bathtub, opening windows, clean linen, free internet and morning coffee in modest lobby. Double bed was cozy but comfortable. A good bet for the budget traveler who plans to take public transportation from downtown location and be mostly out and about.

<Content>You get what you pay for... The hotel is near Union Square and convenient to bus  Cable Car lines, which makes it easy to get around the city. Wanting to spend our money on sightseeing rather than accommodations, we chose the Taylor Hotel at $50/night. The street it's on is a bit creepy, but together (2 women) we felt pretty safe. Whatever you do DON'T get a room on the street. It's VERY noisy. I live in the city and thought it wouldn't be so bad...IT WAS! Couldn't sleep the entire first night...Yikes! The room was clean but very old. The bathroom door didn't close all the way, the t.v. didn't work very well, no phone in room...stuff like that. Overall it was clean and comfortable if you don't plan to spend a lot of time there.

<Content>scruffy but good location whilst looking for a cheap hotel in San Fran I came across nothing better than the Taylor Hotel. but whilst I was there for the weekend I noticed a couple of other hotels in the neighbourhood advertising similar rates of around $50 which could have been better. the Taylor Hotel is scruffy and smells of curry. the rooms are small and the ones facing the street is very noisy. the beds are small and the furniture old. but it's cheap and in a great location so you get what you pay for!

<Content>Very friendly staff, central location to sights, great thai restaurants nearby! The hotel manager lives on premises with his family, very friendly folks. Clean sheets, clean shower...not the Hilton, but very reasonable price for a safe room. Taylor  Post is a very good location...walkable to many restaurants, and the Wharf for a moderately healthy individual. The only down side for me was the street noise, but it is in the city-what can you do?

The location is extremely convenient and we couldn't find a package this good anywhere else for the price.
