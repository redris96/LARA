<Content>Pre-cruise stay- excellent Stayed in this hotel prior to a cruise on the Ruby Princess.Room was excellent, spacious, and comfortable. The bathroom was very nice, with some lovely complimentary toiletries.The bed provised us with a very comfortable night's sleep.When we arrived, in the evening we needed some items and set off to walk to Walmart, a few blocks away. Gave up on that idea as it was impossible to cross one road, let alone several. We returned to the hotel, who promptly got us a taxi.The next morning we crossed a slightly quieter road to the small area of shops/cafes opposite the hotel for breakfast. This was fine and to be recommended, having spoken to people who spent considerably more staying in the hotel for breakfast.We then had a very pleasant hour or so having a drink in the gardens by the pool.After the cruise we were taken back to the hotel for lunch. This was ok but nothing compared to what we had been used to on the ship!Overall, we were pleased with the hotel and would be more than happy to stay there again

<Content>Superior airport hotel We stayed in this hotel for a one night pre-cruise stay and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is new and set in pleasant gardens. The rooms were very clean,decorated and furnished to a high standard. There is an hotel restaurant which is expensive and other guests said that the price of drinks from the bar were high . We arrived early evening feeling a bit peckish there are restaurants and an all night garage selling snacks across the road. However crossing the road is quite a challenge. We had breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant which was buffet style with a good selection of food it cost $18 which I thought was expensive.

<Content>Good hotel but not great Me and my wife stayed for one night prior onboard the cruise at Fort Lauderdale after long haul flight from London Heathrow we were tired -- this hotel is about 15 - 20 minutes from Miami Airport and about 45 - 55 minutes to the Cruise Terminal which is good location for us. Check in ok but we got the first room which is twin bed so we have to go down and ask for new room with king size bed so they changed without trouble -- Room is good size nice and clean -- The only main problem we had was restaurant they only have one main restaurant so we were tired and not feel want to eat anything heavy so we ordered 2 bowls of soup and 2 ceasar salad so we want to have soup for starter and salad as a main dish anyway it turned up all in the same time which we were not expecting that and ceasar salad that we've seen was very disappointed like you are having a bowl of lettuce nothing else no becon and very little of dressing etc.. no taste at all and you have to eat it in a rush because they serving all at the same time and for the cost of the meal wasn't bad but you have to add 15 % gratuties and taxes etc..it turn to be expensive in the end especially if you not enjoy the food -- but breakfast was exceptional cost 拢 32 for both of us. **Be careful for the minibar ** because we were tired and thirsty so we open the fridge and took 1 very small bottle of mineral water ( 125 ml) on the list it cost USD 4.50 then it is fine but when we check out from USD 4.50 they plus gratuties 15%,national tax,local tax etc it turn out about 拢 4 which was too overpriced for small bottle of water. Overall it is ok for one night stay.

<Content>great hotel being a priority club member inter/hotels come under or with the holiday inn chain so researching this hotel we booked with the priority club booking line we found that you can debate the price over the phone with the front desk and make savings as on our return from tampa we re booked and save 30 uk pounds a night .we found this hotel rooms pool and all our needs for filled its clean and friendly staff made it an above average stay .so you say why not an excellent rating well why using the gym one day in a vain effort to stay fit i noted a member of staff shall we say observeing me note she was not laughing either i did not give it any more thought un till that night when i had a knock at the door hey presto it was the local state troopers all two off them.good evening i said what can i do for your selfs i asked their response was a member of staff has reported you taking or stealing a bag from the lift area are i said how did they know it was me answer you have tatoo;s hmm would i then be the only person in miami with these then i said why he had his hand on his gun i do not know perhaps the site of my boxer shorts was making him un easy at this point shall i say a slight chap popped his head round from behind the trooper and said oh its not him thank you and good night was my response of which i slammed the door big hint don't be as stupid as me some troopers take this as a threat,any way a little chat and a free night made me feel happier the hotel manager could not apolagise enough a polite hard time was given by my self so should you stay yes have art work on your arms at your peril

<Content>Nice enough, but inconvenient location and smelly rooms We just needed a place to stay overnight between flights in and out of Miami airport so booked this through priceline as a Miami Airport area hotel. This hotel is in fact much farther from the airport than the other Miami airport area hotels. The shuttle runs only once per hour and does not run at all late night, so the cab ride there will cost you $25 and eat up whatever you saved by not staying at the Hilton right next to the airport. We checked in and were given a standard king room on the third floor. The smell inside the room was unbearable. It smelled like someone had spilled rotten meat in the carpets. It was horrid. We requested another room and were given one on the fourth floor with its own breed of unpleasant odor. It was not quite as putrid as the first and we were tired so decided to make the best of it.Other than the location and smelly rooms, the hotel is nice enough, with a nice lobby and decent service. You can take the free shuttle to the airport, but do not rely on it if you are coming from the airport. Bottom line is that if you need a hotel close to Miami airport, you are probably better off with the Hilton or Sofitel even if you need to pay a little more.

<Content>Great stay at the Intercontinental. My husband and I stayed here for a couple of nights in July with our 18 month old. We bid on priceline and got a great rate. The staff was very helpful and the room was immaculate. A VERY comfortable bed and large room made the stay very pleasant. This hotel is in a great location for us; easy access to the Florida Turnpike and to other highways for the short 10-15min. drive to South Beach. We would stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic This hotel and the service was amazing. The staff at check-in was extremely professional, helpful and friendly. Our room was immaculate. The bed was really comfortable. The bathroom's shower was glorious, the towels were big and luxurious, the toilettries were high-end. Everything was perfect. In fact, because we have a long distance relationship and it was the last night of our weekend together (a fact I mentioned in passing to the girl at check-in) we got chocolate dipped strawberries and wine sent to our room to make our night even more special! The pool is open 24 hours and it's very nice and clean.I LOVED this hotel. Loved the entire experience and I would stay here again ANY TIME!

<Content>Over crowded Sunday mornings I've stayed at this Intercontiental before and the concierge staff are excellent, the rooms fine and also the location if you have a car, however they accomodate pre-cruise tourists Saturdays nights so the hotel is crowded and the Sunday morning breakfast is a total fiasco.Hence if you are not part of the group there is no individual attention for the other guests.They do not have enough resturant staff available, not enough seating, totally overwelmed resulting in lousy service( I suggest you look for your own cutlery as they don't have time for cleaning used tables) not close to the quality of hotel this pretends to be.

<Content>Not as good as before Stayed here a few times and have reviewed it before. The stay was a one night pre-cruise stay. In our opinion the hotel standards had dropped a bit from our previous stays. For example, the room was that little less pristine, still clean but a bit careworn and dust which would not have been present before, was.Also on ordering form the bar meals to be taken at the poolside, whilst the service was excellent and friendly the dirty plates and glasses were still by the pool 15 hours later. Not what you expect from Intercontinental. That said the beds were comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful and I would have no problem staying there again.

<Content>Good Given our situation, being stranded in Miami for one day, we were able to book a room through Hotwire for $150 per night. I must say the hotel was nice. If it wasnt for the cold front in Florida, we might have enjoyed the pool. The cab ride from the airport cost about $24. Across the street from the hotel there are gas stations with convenience store, Dunkin Donuts, Wendy's and McDonalds. There is a free airport shuttle that runs every hour. I have no complaints for a one night stay due to a flight cancellation. If I ever return to Miami would I stay here again? No only because it's too far away from South Beach and nightlife. Best way would be to rent a car. There is a parking lot on the hotel premises.

<Content>Awesome stay We booked this hotel through Priceline after finding out that a decent hotel in the Miami area is very expensive. We were only staying for an evening on our way from Minnesota to Jamaica. We got a great rate ($150 for one night) and had a fabulous stay! The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds are comfortable. Included in our room rate was a breakfast buffet (bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, toast, muffins, fresh tropical fruit, etc), tea time (tea, coffee and snacks) from 2-4, and also a cocktail hour where we received 2 free drinks and appetizers. All of these activities took place down the hall from our room on the 3rd floor. There is also a complimentary shuttle to/from Miami International Airport. You get a lot of bang for your buck!We utilized the concierge and he was EXTREMELY helpful. We told him that we wanted to eat at a Brazillian steak house in the area. Within 5 minutes he had made us reservations and called us a cab. When we arrived the woman at the front desk was also very helpful in offering dining options!The only negative thing I have to say is that we called the front desk to see if we could get a room at the same rate for our one night stay after our Jamaica trip, and they were not able to accommodate us. I was a little surprised considering it would have been on a Tuesday night, so I can't imagine they would be full. I was told I would need to go through the Priceline process again.

<Content>Beautiful property with a latin flavor This hotel is lovely with a beautiful appearance, nice pool and in very good condition. Location is great for airport and express way access (close to Turnpike, Palmetto and Dolphin Expressways). Main drawback is service. Everything is very latin about the place including the manana attitude. Staff is polite but cannot be hurried or rushed and will take their time with no apology. Parking is complimentary. INternet is NOT. There is a very nice La Quinta nearby you can go to where inernet is free. I would stay here again knowing what to expect.

<Content>This is an Inter-Continental??? Could have fooled me! If you have to stay here, leave your preconceived notions of the Inter-Continental Hotel brand at home. This place is more like a Holiday Inn Express.The staff were apathetic and downright unhelpful in any regard. Many, including the lady making omelets at breakfast, didn't speak a word of English. (Forgive me, but when I stay at an international-chain hotel anywhere in the world, I expect the restaurant and front-desk staff to speak English. Miami is no exception.)Physically, the place is comfortable enough, but no more comfortable than any other airport hotel. (I will say, however, that the rooms are very well sound-proofed. I couldn't hear any planes taking off or landing during the night.) My room was small, with a parking-lot view. Bathroom amenities were only standard. The bed was way, way too soft and mushy. (Bad mattresses are bad mattresses, no matter how many layers of linens and pillows you throw on them.)Room service was slow and EXTREMELY overpriced. The breakfast was similarly overpriced and just okay. The business center has a single computer/printer and closes early.Check-out was slow. The check-in clerk did something wrong with my credit card (I never did understand what the problem was, because the check-out clerk explained the problem to me in Spanglish) and this delayed my departure -- with no apology.Finally, the location is awful. It's technically an airport hotel, because it's just beyond the far end of one of the MIA runways. But the runways are very LONG; it's at least a 20-minute taxi ride from the terminal to the hotel. The hotel is nowhere near the beach -- or anything else for that matter. Unless you're there to visit one of the nearby strip-malls, stay elsewhere.

<Content>Need to better communicate airport shuttle times My wife and I stayed here for 1 night. We flew in from St Kitts and wanted to spend the night and eat Cuban food.When we arrived I called the hotel to arrange ground shuttle pick-up. I was told that it just left. It was 735PM. Then I was told that it goes every hour. We had to wait another hour for pick-up.At check-in I asked about the shuttle for the next morning (we had an 8:30AM departure). I was told that the first one left at 630AM.The next morning at 552 I called to verify that the shuttle was on time because leaving at 630AM and a departure at 830AM was going to make checking-in and going through security really pressing for time. I was told that the shuttle left at 6AM. With a mad scramble to gather our belongings and running to the lobby we did make the shuttle, barely. It left on the minute at 600AM.The miscommunication of shuttle times caused a lot of unnecessary frustration, rushing, and anxiety for my wife and I.The hotel is nice (listed as 4 stars) and had pillow top mattress beds and all the other 4 star amenities.If you use the ground shuttle, Beware. It goes only 1 time each hour. Check with hotel and, hopefully, they will give you the correct times.

<Content>Nice but Cold This was a nice hotel with an Excellent Concierge who gave detailed instructions on how to drive to certain locations. The rooms are like freezers, even when you turn the unit to low. Do not try to use the bathrobe/footies they give you in the closet because there is a charge. I liked the fact that every day housekeeping put ice in the bucket since they don't have an area on the floor for you to get ice. You have to go to the dining room for ice. The hotel also offers umbrellas for your usage in case you forget yours. The one downfall was when I called the front desk at night to ask some question about the hotel and the person who answered the phone couldn't answer them  told me to call back and speak to someone in the morning who could answer my questions. Also there was someone constantly smoking in the hallway near the elevators to keep from smoking in the no smoking rooms. Nice hotel for business stay.

<Content>Good business hotel but beware the noise from the planes I stayed 3 nights at the Intercontinental West Miami for a business trip. The location was convenient as it was close to the offices I was visiting. However, beware that the hotel is directly in the continuation of one of MIA airport runways, therefore, aircrafts fly low and frequently right above the hotel. It did not disturb me to sleep, but at the swimming pool, there was quite a lot of noise. Otherwise, the rooms are very clean, very large (American standard), well equipped and the staff is friendly. In summary a good business traveller's hotel.

<Content>Very nice hotel We overnighted at this hotel on our way home from Key West in July 2007. The rooms are very nice and clean - really comfy king size beds! Excellent access to MIA - the shuttle runs hourly. Be sure to check the hotel website before making reservations through a third party - we saved about $20/night by booking direct - paid less for this hotel than for the BB we stayed in at Key West - $112/night.Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Disappointing Stay - Some good and some bad This was not the short drive from the airport touted by the website.The shuttle runs once per hour during daylight hours only, so you may have a long wait to catch it, then a long wait in traffic before arriving. The hotel itself was quite nice, very clean and comfortable. The people at the desk were helpful and seemed knowledgable. The problem was the only restaurant on the property, which was pretty awful, although I must say the food was very good. How could this be? Well the service was awful. A completely empty restaurant, we stood at the entry more than ten minutes as the staff walked around inside talking to one another and ignoring us. Once seated (oh yes, we're open...) another very long, long wait for sometone to take our order, bring water, etc. On top of that, even though it clearly states on the menu that gratuity is added on bills for five or more people, they added two gratuities to our party of two's bill. I didn't notice till I looked at the bill later that there were three gratuities, my own and their two. That made my $16. hamburger and soda more than $36. Since there were no other restaurants within sight, I foolishly ate breakfast there the next morning and got another two gratuities put on my bill. By the way, cereal and milk is $12. If you want anything with eggs it's at least $16.00 (before the add-on gratuities and sales tax.) The front desk was nice about taking my own gratuity off the check upon check-out but said the restaurant was a separate entity and she could not change the prices or gratauities they added. Oh yeah, AFTERthe gratuitis were added, then they added sales tax to that. I checked and found out that in Florida you are not allowed to charge tax on gratuities which is a payroll item, however they do it anyway.Because of the restaurant experience, I felt very ripped off so I did not have a good experience. If you stay there, it would be much better to take a cab or the complimentary shuttle to another restaurant. There are several about one mile way.

<Content>Surrounded by Warehouses and Staffed by Neophytes! I stayed one night before leaving on a once-a-day early morning flight to a remote Bahamian Island. Due to the international boat show being in town, I couldn't even get Priceline to accept a bid on a 4 star for less than $239 over the course of a week's bidding. The Intercontinental is NOT worth that, even on a sunny day, which mine was not!The airport shuttle service runs only once an hour, when and if they feel like it to the airport. The drivers take side trips to rental car lots with people who aren't even staying at the hotel, making what should be a 10 minute trip run into an hour-long airport route circuit. Shady dealings. Taxis are exorbitant and purposefully slow, as they run on meters in that direction west of the airport, rather than on a flat rate like towards the Atlantic and SoBe. Several VERY short cab rides cost me $12-$20 a piece. I didn't rent a car due to the airport hotel with shuttle billing, which is far from reality.Just a few miles away from the hotel is the Dolphin Mall, which is like traveling to the third world! Spanish is the native language there, and although I speak fairly fluently, it just isn't right! The feel and look of the mall, even though it includes familiar brand stores, is of a Tijuana or Cancun bazaar. The end of Miami surrounding the hotel is warehouse central, but there is a mediocre McDonalds across the very busy highway-like street, which I highly recommend. It's WAY better than the cafeteria-like fare you'll get at the Intercontinental. Don't venture near a buffet! They take the leftovers from the convention caterings and re-serve the crusty, old concoctions to anyone foolish enough to venture in. Plus, the quality is industrial can grade to start! Everything is room temperature and non-appetizing. When queried, I said my food was NOT good, but I got a shrug and a refilled water glass instead of an offer to make things right.WiFi doesn't work in the rooms, for me or for all the other guests with whom I conversed, and I spent a good part of the afternoon trying to figure out why with a tech support person in the midwest, with whom I finally got connected by the front desk. Oh, and the staff are all wildly young, all new to the hotel, all outrageously inexperienced in the hospitality industry, and all completely non-solution-oriented. That's IF you can get them to answer at all.The physical plant of the hotel is 3 stars tops. That's because of the nicely landscaped small pool in the back courtyard, a mediocre fitness center, the non-functioning business center, the gift shop, and the decent sized rooms and bathrooms with large sink counters. However, due to the inept staff, rotten food, and aggravations, the hotel plummets to a 1 very quickly.

<Content>Wonderful airport stay Got a great deal through Hotwire (110/night). Very pleased with the comfortable and luxurious room. Bed was so comfortable, great decor, comfortable chair, outstanding toiletries, wonderful shower (although no matter what we did we wound up with a puddle on the floor), and comfy towels. Very attractive public areas, and staff were friendly. Housekeeping respected the do not disturb sign and did a good job keeping up the room. Did not try the restaurant. Husband said that the workout room was okay, but a bit small. Did not use the airport transportation, so can't comment on that. For the price (through Hotwire) this was a good deal, but given how expensive the airport hotels are, even not through Hotwire it is probably still a good deal! I have stayed at 3 other Miami airport hotels: Red Roof Inn (basic and not recommended), Sofitel (nice, but not as nice as the Intercontinental), and the bizarrely overrated and overpriced Hamptom Inn (twice the price of the Intercontinental on the same date). This one was my favorite, and if I returned to the area and needed an airport hotel would look here first. I'm also more likely to stay at another Intercontinental in the future.

<Content>Great Pool and Room We stayed there for 5 nights and had a great stay.The Bed was as you may see at other reviews very comfy andthe room was also very clean.The Pool is great for a few length swim and you can enjoy watching the planes coming down.Important to know is: If you do not have a car it is not convinient to stay at that location due to a little drive to most attractions.By having a car it is a perfect location.Nearby Mall's Intl. Mall and Dolphin Mall (Great for all the womens out there) :)Also a great starting point for driving down to Key West and other Areas...One Negative Point was that the temperature in the Lobby/Elevator Area was very cold in my views...Enjoy...

<Content>The Most Comfy Bed I Have Ever Slept In!!!!!!!!! My family of four stayed here for an overnighter. I paid $140 via Priceline, which is pretty reasonable considering this is a 4 star hotel in Miami during high season. If you called around the city for a hotel of the same quality, you would easily have to pay over $300 a night. This particular hotel posted a rack rate of $459. The room was nicely appointed; the lobby was beautiful with live orchid plants and bromeliads;very exotic looking. We did not use the pool since we didn't arrive until after 10pm and wanted to get to bed so we could head for Key West the next day. Check in and check out were quick, no problems of any sort that I can recall. This hotel is in a nice area of Doral; there are numerous places to eat such as Tony Romano's, Chili's, Pollo Tropical, Outback Steakhouse, Applebee's, Longhorn Steakhouse, etc if you prefer not to dine in the hotel's restaurant. The Walmart is within walking distance also ( we had to buy clothes, socks, underwear, etc since luggage ended up being flown to Tampa instead of Miami and we were without for over 2 days!!!!!!My teens said this hotel was their favorite because of the comfy beds!

<Content>Great Hotel..! My wife  I stayed overnight Fri 12th Jan 2007 prior to embarking on a Princess Cruise. We were very very happy with the experience of this hotel.We arrived at approx 6.30pm. The check in was quick  friendly and our room - 213 - was brilliant.It was big and very well presented. A fabulous big bed, good sized bathroom, good decor and spotless. What more could anyone want?We ate in the restaurant and opted for the a la carte menu. Okay it's a bit more than the bar menu but the prices are not excessive. The service in the restaurant was very good and so was the food.The pool area is lovely. Well laid out with established plants  trees. The pool is a decent enough size - dont forget, this is primarily an airport hotel not a resort.We opted for breakfast in bed on the Saturday morning. It arrived within 20mins of ordering and was excellent.Do not be put off by some of the reviews already posted.

<Content>A little over their head This is my usual hotel when I come to Miami, I always paid from 89 to 130 and I always found it a good value. However, this time it was more like 259 (they tell me because of the season, even if I made the reservation a month in advance) . I thought they had adjusted the property a little to charge this and made the reservation. My review this time is considering that rate and what I expected from them at that rate. At those prices I would never stay here, it makes no sense when I get the same room, same so so front desk service, and still paying internet extra. If I pay that rate I am expecting they adjust their offering as well. We stayed with our 18 month kid and the crib was very small and without proper blankets (we had to put our own since the one from the hotel was not appropiate), no plug protectors for the kid ( I asked for them, other $259 hotel would send for a few at wallmart and say yes, a 2 dollar solution or check the reservation before the guest arrived and had them prior to our arrival) , rug was very dirty, when walking barefoot before a shower our feet would rinse black dirt in the tub.Service at the concierge lounge and bellman was very good I must admit. They outdid themselves in helping us with the baby. However, I believe value for this property is way diminished at those prices.

<Content>Great Deal from Hotwire We got to Miami on 12/15 (Friday) for our cruise on 12/16. We originally had reservations for the Baymont hotel at the airport. The whole reason we booked there was because they had a shuttle to the port, and let you leave your care there free while on the cruise. When we arrived we found that it was in an awful part of town AND the shuttles to the port were full until 2:30PM. Since we are usually on board and enjoying the ship by noon, this would not have worked for us. We also weren't wild about leaving our car there.We used hotwire and got the Hotel Intercontinental for $79 + taxes...a total of $91. We were very impressed by the quality of this hotel...especially for this price. The only problem was the traffic on 87th street in front of the hotel. Even though it was before 4:00PM, it took us about 40 minutes to get from the airport area to the hotel. We went to dinner in our car and it took us 1/2 hour to go two and 1/2 blocks. We then pulled into a bar-b-que restuarant which we could have walked to (we didn't want to sit in the car any longer).The hotel was really a 4-star hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable with fluffy comfortors and plenty of pillows. The rooms were very quiet We didn't use any of the services of the hotel, but for $91 we felt we had a great deal.BTW, someone posted that nobody in the hotel speaks English. That wasn't entirely true, but this is MIami. You can go into a K-Mart or Wl-mart and not find anybody who speaks English.

<Content>Good location... Acceptable service... The location of the hotel is great, everything its close by, so you do not have to travel a long way to find real bargains or a good restaurant, The hotel is close to Dolphin Mall, where you can find anything. The service is not the best in the world, specially at the reception, where improvements in customer service are urgent. The limited breakfast at the Club Lounge was cold every day. Even though, with its problems, this is a nice hotel, close to the airport.

<Content>ok for a short stay I stayed at this hotel in the first week of december...it was ok for an airport hotel. many of their staff dont understand proper english ! even the one in the buisness center. I think they are charging more than the services they provide. However its in safe location..and clean for one or two nights stay.

<Content>LOVED this hotel! I got a great deal on this hotel, thinking it was going to be average quality, but was completely surprised by the top service and classiness. The featherbeds were extremely comfortable, and the overall decor and landscaping was well above my expectations for this price- i would place this hotel in the $200 range even for being outside the city, but i was lucky enough to get it for $80/night on fri-sat nights labor day weekend! The pool was also huge, and well designed poolside seating, lounge chairs- 24 hr pool/gym was a plus! The location was very accessible since we had a rental car, and didn't mind driving into the city (about 15min drive to miami beach). On the same street were also chain restaurants (chilli's, wendy's, macaroni grill, red lobster) and stores (dolphin mall only an exit away), so the location seemed practical for anyone's needs, especially since there's also a complimentary shuttle to the airport. I would definitely stay again!

<Content>Very Comfortable, great service We stayed here one night at the end of a trip to Peru. We found the hotel to be very luxurious and comfortable. The pool and exercise room are open 24 hrs. The service was great, we'll definitely stay here again!

<Content>Fine We stayed here for 1 night prior to embarking on a Princess Cruise. Our room was very comfortable with a very comfortable bed and clean with an excellent shower in the bathroom. WE dined in the Restaurant (a la carte) and found the service to be a bit hit and miss. The food was very nice but pricey and I wouldn't recommend this if you want a fine dining experience because we had finished our meal within 50 minutes of sitting down.The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful.Breakfast was buffet style and there was a good choice.This is predominantly a conference hotel and not ideal for a family holiday. There is very little to do in the surrounding area as it's a commercial area and the hotel is situated very close to the airport -although you can't hear the planes from inside the hotel.

<Content>No Ice Machine, slow room service Unlike what other reviews indicate, there is no mandatory valet parking. There are no ice machines or soda machines. The entrance to the hotel is still under some renovation. Enjoyed my stay.

<Content>Standard stuff We stayed 1 night whilst en route to Fort Lauderdale as part of the Princess Cruise package. The room was fine - two regular sized double beds, which suited us as we travelled with my 10 yr old daughter. Fairly compact, but fine for 1 night. The biggest disappointment was the buffet dinner. After a long journey we were not keen to set off outside the hotel, so opted for the easy convenience of eating in. The buffet was expensive and of very poor quality. The hot food choice was poor and unappealing. We saw people choosing a la carte, and wished we had. We expected the worst therefore for breakfast, yet this was suprisingly better than the dinner options, and quite pleasant, before we set off to embark on our cruise. Not our choice of hotel, but functional and well located. (Other people did venture out, and found other restaurants, but had to cross major roads to do so.)

<Content>Great Stay at Intercontinental West Miami We stayed 2 nights at this hotel while in Miami for the Orange Bowl. Our price of $109 was a true bargain compared to prices of other properties we considered. The room was very nice and clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and we found the service to be excellent. You did have to request ice but we never had a problem getting it. The staff was helpful with directions and even taped up one of our coolers that cracked before gametime! The pool was small but pretty and the restaurant had a good (but expensive) brunch. Others in our party had lunch there and also said the food was good. This is not the place to stay if you are visiting the beach but it is near the airport, has several chain restaurants nearby and is close to Doral. One final note, about 4 hours after we had checked out, I realized I had left a shopping bag with about $100 worth of cosmetics (Sephora) in the room. We called and they had the bag at the desk!

<Content>Really bad service Decent hotel room, good airport location BUT internet access was difficult, and room service brought me really cold food and took forever. Also, the hotel has no ice machine, so you must call room service everytime you want ice. Desk clerks did not answer the phone on sevral occasions. The flip side, the restaurant had really good filets and decent lobster and really good crab cakes. Overall, decent hotel that needs to retrain the staff in full service customer service.

<Content>Not as bad as I expected based on reviews I got this hotel through Priceline for a 12/3/05 stayover prior to a cruise. After reading a good deal of bad reviews about it, I was very pleased with this hotel. As I traveled with my wife and kids, we were not looking to go out and party the night before our cruise, but wanted a clean place to stay at a good rate in a safe area. All 3 wishes were met. The staff was great, the room was spotless and comfortable. I truly found nothing bad about this hotel other than it is west of the airport--(Only took maybe 15 minutes to downtown though.) If you get this hotel, via priceline, dont worry about reviews---you will be pleasantly surprised.
