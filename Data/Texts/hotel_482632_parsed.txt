<Content>Great service My wife and i visited Florence during our European tour from Australia staying at Hotel Montreal. Great little hotel, good position close to train station and walking distance to many attractions. Particularly impressed with the friendly service received from staff who did eveything possible to make our stay memorable. Highly recommended

<Content>Centrally located to bus station Rooms were very clean; fortunately there was a lift to take our suitcases up or down. Breakfast was terrific. And the hotel was about 5 minutes to everything.

<Content>Agree about location and faults We were here in April so not too crowded and we had a room on the 1st floor quite near the elevator. I did explore and found the long hall and stairs to the other floors as mentioned by others. Our room was small but otherwise fine as was the small bath.Breakfast was meager even for Italy but better than nothing.We booked because of the location near the train station, though in the rain it wasn't close enough! We also took a bus to Siena from the station right close and yes, walking to the main sights and market was very easy. One of the best things was a little restaurant a couple of doors away called La Grotta di Leo where meals were reasonably priced and apparently popular with the locals. We ate there 3 times along with family and school groups in the various rooms which were always full.

<Content>great value, good location Small, basic, clean hotel. Great value too.Good location - very close to train and bus station which was great when we arrived at midnight! Staff were friendly and helpful. Our double room was clean and well equipped, if a bit small. Bathroom was clean and well equipped also. Hotel is a short walk to the main sites - generally no more than 15 minutes. Breakfast was ok. Basic continental choice. Avoid their coffee though - it's dire!

<Content>Excellent value We booked via booking.com and had two double bedrooms. The rooms and bathrooms were nice and clean. We stayed at the 'depandance' unit which is simply a short walk from the main hotel. It was no problem to walk down the road for the included breakfast. Keep in mind there are a few stairs though to get to the rooms. Very close to the train station!

<Content>A great place for a quick stay I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Montreal. The location, near the train station, was perfect. The price was good for what I got. Most of all, the director of the hotel, Roberto Boccaccelli, was a fountain of information and politeness. I recommend this place without reservation.

<Content>Loved this friendly clean hotel My friends and I recently spent two nights at this hotel and would highly recommend it. The hotel is very central and within walking distance of all the beauty of Florence as well as being only two minutes walk from the train station.The staff were welcoming and very helpful. The rooms were larger than I expected with a small balcony. They were clean and bright with air conditioning, a definite must in the heat of Florence in the summer. The hotel is in a quiet side street so no noise late at night. The hotel is very reasonably priced with the added bonus of breakfast included in the price. I would use this hotel again and would recommend it for both business and pleasure.

<Content>Stay Away... I stayed at this hotel for a night on August 17, 2008. First, this hotel is very close to the train station, but so are loads of hotel in the area - so nothing unique or special about location. The room I got is Ok for a triple, is on the small side but it is fine with me as basically I use hotel to sleep only. Carpet on the lift - very dirty. My room was on 1st floor where I suspect hotel must have used it as their storage area as well, outside my room, loads and loads of big blue sacks piled at the entrance hallway, worries me that should a fire broke out at night, my children and I might not be able to run due to these obstructions, wouldn't recommend to travellers with small children or seniors. Beside my room is a toilet (I have my own bathroom so I don't have to use this one). The problem is it opened and closed the whole night causing a lot of noise and keep waking me up, people (not sure if travellers or staff of the hotel) keep walking and talking outside my room. The major problem is air-con doesn't work, I went down to inform the receptionist, he told me flatly there is nothing he can do, can't change room as it is fully booked (I don't believe him), I requested a fan then, he went down the basement supposedly to look and told me there is no fan, and just turn his back on me like I am a nuisance. I am so tired after travelling the whole day so wouldn鈥檛 want to argue with him. Imagine, almost 30 degree in a room with no air-con, can't open the windows as overlooking the roof, for security reason, it is unwise to open them. Breakfast is definitely something you could miss, can't even remember what I have eaten except for a bread. When I went out for sightseeing in the morning, Mr. Receptionist requested I leave the room key and he hung it on a rack at the reception area. At around lunch time, I decided to return back to hotel to have a shower as it is really hot, there is no one at the reception area. I waited for about 7 minutes, still no one in sight and I just go around the table and grab my room key and go straight to my room. Absolutely no security at all!! Room keys are hung in open area; people can come in and just grab keys on the rack and ransack every hotel room. There is still no one at the reception area when I went out again after my shower so I decided to take the key with me. And even when I checked-out later there is still no one in the reception area so after waiting for a while, I just return the key on the rack and pull my luggage and left as I have train to catch.

<Content>Stay away it is a horror!!!!!!!!! Don't be fooled by some of the reviews. If you are given room 303, run away!!! We were told to take the elevator to the first floor(of course they neglected to tell us that was as far as it goes), we had to haul our luggage through a labirynth of hallways and up 2 flights. The room smelled as though someone had deficated on the rugs. Some other druken tourists, decided also to relieve themselves in a vase that stood just outside our doorway. The smell was unbearable and when I complained all they could say, was Mi Dispiace. The stay at this hotel put a damper on our visit to Florence.

<Content>A Good Stay, Nice Value Hotel We enjoyed our 3 night stay here, in July 208, The check in staff were friendly and helpful, the location is quite good with a few Restruants near by including the leos grotto which was quite good value. However the streets behind the hotel appear to be a bit seedy with lots of illegal immigrants creeping around so avoid the back lanes.The rooms are good and quite large they have classic Italian decor good air con which is a must in Florence summer and clean linen,,the bathroom was clean and a good size.. The breakfast was good with a nice room and a very friendly lady working there each morning.Its very easy to walk from there to the train and bus station and most of Florence's attractions in easy walking distance.It represents good value for money and I would go back.

<Content>This Hotel was a very goed choice We were looking for a cheap hotel in the centre of the city with elevator, because my wife cannot go up the stairs. We've got what we wanted. Even the entrance has no steps.The room on the first floor was clean, had everything you need.The breakfast was more than OK and the staff was very polite and helpful. They all speak very good English.Within 2 km you can find every nice places.We had a nice week in this hotel. Florence is a fantastic nice city.For a hotel with only 1 star it is excellent, but anyway it is a very good hotel. This Hotel is suitable for people with limited moving capabilities.

<Content>Convenient location Hotel Montreal is a centrally located small hotel, just 5 minutes' walk from Florence's city centre and the station. I had a small single room, which was adequate but a bit basic, and smelt a little stale. The bathroom was shared, seemingly between several rooms, so one had to wait to get in. Breakfast was a cold buffet, adequate, but not very appetising. The reception staff did not seem very friendly, although they were competent. The main advantage of Hotel Montreal is its central location, and the fairly low cost (for Florence) . I stayed there for one night, but would not have wanted a long stay.

<Content>Good Breakfast We booked at Hotel Montreal but they put us up in another hotel - Hotel Elite, some blocks away. We had to climb a number of steps with our baggage, so beware when you book at Hotel Montreal. The breakfast was good. The room very small  so also the bathroom. It is very close to the station. On the whole it was nice.

<Content>Not a 1 star---definitely a 3 star! This was listed as a one star---probably because some of the rooms did not have a private bath. But, ours did and we thought it was a great hotel in a pretty good location. It was really close to the train station---we walked there with luggage--no problem. Our room was on the top floor, and the elevator only went to the first floor---so if you can't lug you luggage up steep stairs---get a room on the first floor. Other than the deadly stairs---this was one of the best hotels I stayed in on a month trip to Europe. Everything in Florence is close, so any location in the Old Town is good.

Restaurants right there. Doesn't have to be expensive to stay in Florence. Staff more than accomodating. Speak english and very very nice. Was able to e-mail before arriving and they wrote back quickly with all the answers. Called from Rome and very accomodating. Just the best. This was 2nd time in Florence. First time hotel was fine but more expensive. Hotel Montreal was reasonably priced and no surprises once we got there. Just PERFECT!

<Content>Bargain Break Hotel for tourists on a budget Stayed at Hotel Montreal in Florence for four nights from April 22nd 2008. Hotel three minutes from SMN stations and really good for the sites. First floor ensuite room was very compact but spotless and well cared for. Staff were friendly and helpful and polite. Breakfast OK - continental. Hotel adjacent to student type bar so quad glazing needed at night. Booked via Octopus travel for a bargain break. Great holiday

The proximity of the hotel to the station was also very convenient as it is a short walk and we were able to convey our luggage to and from the hotel very easily. We would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to anyone else.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Of all the hotels that we stayed at during our month long trip to Italy/France, this was overall probably the nicest. The room was a little small but it was nicely decorated and clean. The bathroom was also small but....we had a bathroom that was clean. The hotel offered free internet access if you had your own computer which was very nice. The breakfast room was nice however it was the standard breakfast of coffee and bread. The hotel is located near the train station and there is an expensive Laundromat down the street. There are many restaurants near the hotel. The staff was helpful in giving us a map of Florence and sending us in the right direction. My only recommendation would be to make sure that you spend enough days in Florence. There are many things to see and from Florence you can take day trips to Pisa and the wine country of Tuscany.

<Content>Good place to stay in Florence! We stayed in this hotel 3 nights end of December 07. Overall it is a great place to stay- very close to the train station yet very quiet, clean and pretty spacious. Staff is very nice and helpful except for one guy, not sure what his name was. When my friend tried to use the phone on the premises to make a call, she found out that it just eats the coins and asked a guy on the night shift if he knows what to do.His answer was -  What am I , a technician? Go call outside. Pretty rude in my opinion. Stephania, on the other hand, was very helpful and speaks very good English. Internet connection is 4 euro per 15 minutes I think but you can always use an internet cafe just 2 blocks down the street. The rates are great - 50 eurocents per 15 minutes, 1 euro per 30 minutes. They have 3 stories but elevator can get you up only to the 1st floor (from the lobby) so be careful if you have heavy bags. We will probably come back.

<Content>EX and great value We have much pleasure in recommending Hotel Montreal. Its location was perfect within walking distance of all tourist spots,it is in a quiet street near the train station,which is perfectly safe. The owner welcomed us and was very helpful. The room we occupied was large, quiet,comfortable and very well appointed, with an ex en suite bathroom. The breakfast area was very nicely furnished, and breakfast was fine. Atogether I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It is more representative of a three star hotel than a one star. Having stayed in three star hotels in Italy, this hotel compares favourably with them, and yet it has only one star and is half the price. We have already recommended it to our friends, and will be back there on our next visit

<Content>Average The elevator only goes up one floor and you have to climb the rest of the way up to your room. The room was spacious, but it did not feel completely clean. The worst part of the room was the toilet, you had to pump at it several times before it would flush. The pros of the hotel was that it was close to the train station and you can basically walk to every sight and sound.

<Content>Get what you pay for You get what you pay for with this hotel. If you're thinking of staying here, remember it IS a 1 star hotel. The rooms were very small (but I find this is often the case in Europe) and it was very apparent that they were not properly cleaned. Pillows and cups in the bathroom were still marked with makeup after the rooms had been made up after our first day there (pillow was simply flipped over to the clean side). There is a bar next door, which our room was located right above, and I was worried that it would be very noisy, but found that when the windows were closed, you really couldn't hear any of the noise, so that turned out to be okay.The main positive thing about this hotel is its location. It is within walking distance to the train station as well as to Il Duomo and the main attractions in Florence. Although, Florence is such a small, compact city, that I'm sure pretty much any hotel you would stay in would be close to all the main sites. We were fine with the size of the room even if it was small, b/c the location was great and it was basically just a place to sleep, but it would've been nice to know they actually cleaned the sheets we were sleeping on.

<Content>Hated this hotel.Never go there again.................. Stayed at hotel from 10-8-07 to 10-13-07. Worst place we have ever stayed at and on top of that ...Worst customer service. Did not care about the problems we experienced at the hotel!!1)Rooms were extremely small/tight  no room to get around the room. 2)No place to put your clothes except for a small/tall armoire. There were 2 of us only enough room for 1 person's stuff, majority stuff had to stay in 2 luggages for 5 days (not good!!). 3)Mattresses were extremely flat/hard  pillows just as bad. 4)Hotel rooms were moldy (wall paper was pealing off one of the walls). 5)Air conditioning system did not work. Water dripped down on the floor from the AC vent  water was all over the carpet  some of our luggage/clothes.6)Came out next day and fixed the AC, but never apologized about the incident or offered to clean our wet/dirty clothes. On the 3rd day I advised them they needed to clean the clothes that were soiled so we could use some of them. 7)AC went off without any notification at 7:30pm same day it was fixed.8)Called office,advised the hotel system automatically shuts off at 7:30pm-to next morning at 7:00am. Advised to open windows to get fresh air since it was fall season  cool outside. That would have been great except we had this huge problem every night to deal with........**All night unable to sleep!! Bar next door loud music blaring from bar every night for 5 nights!!! (15-20 bikers,30-35 college students  20-25 high school kids hanging outside in the middle alley throwing bottles around, screaming/laughing from 9:00pm to 4:00am. Never slept it was extremely loud and scarry**Spoke to desk rep/supervisor advised have to see if they have another room available  we would have to pay the extra 20-40 Euro's if we wanted to make a change. No guarantee's if a room was available and second of all, they should have moved us to another without additional charge. We were so exhausted from hassling with these people that we just wanted to finish our stay there and get on to the next city we were going to visit.

<Content>Very nice experience To get to the Hotel Montreal, leave the train station and go right. Turn right again and walk along the side of the train station (by steps). Make a left at the next street and Hotel Montreal is clearly marked (past the internet place) on the right.The hotel clerk spoke english. The check-in was very quick but we had to leave our passports for a little while so we went up to our room, #302. It is on the complete other side of the building - quite a hike! But it was huge with two rooms. The first room had a single bed with a rollaway under it and two huge closets and a desk. The next room had a double bed and a tv. The bathroom was a good size and the shower heated up faster than our shower at home with nice pressure. Flushing the toilet was like a game - push the button rapidly until it flushes. Breakfast was simple but good - croissants, rolls, cereal, OJ, milk, tea, hot chocolate, and coffee. It's included so that worked!The location was great. It is within walking distance of the Duomo, shopping, restaurants, etc. I thought it was great for the price.

<Content>Loved this hotel! This was the favourite out of four hotels we stayed in Italy. The staff were very friendly, the room was large, comfy with great AC. The hotel was in a great location for walking to all the sites. There was a train strike on the day we were leaving and the receptionist went out of her way to see what few trains were still running. The photos on the website don't do it justice!

<Content>Great Value.. Hotel Montreal is great value. We paid 65 euro a night for a double room and breakfast. Our room was really nice, it looked like it had been recently renovated and was well sound proofed against what would have been an awfully noisey street. So top points for comfort and cleanliness but the staff and area let it down a little. .

<Content>Excellent Stay! This was a great hotel, especially for the reasonable rates. We had a fairly spacious room with a private bath. The rooms are extremely comfortable with constant A/C. The staff was extremely helpful and even booked the reservations with the museums for us. Breakfast was excellent. The location is great. There are lots of shops, restaurants, etc. in the area and access to local transportation is easy. They do lock the front doors at a certain time, but usually there is a staff member nearby. We are not luxurious travellers, and were very excited about the great accommodations we received for our money. Excellent value!

<Content>A 3 Star Hotel with a 1 Star Price The Hotel Montreal is truly a great find and superb value. In May, 2007, we stayed in a triple room with private bath for 4 nights. Florence is a compact city. The historical center and River Arno were within easy walking distance from the hotel. One of the best reasons to stay at the Montreal was its proximity to the SMN train station and public transporation. It was convenient and easy to visit local sights, and make day trips to Siena, San Gimignano, etc. Next to the hotel was a small bar. For our stay, we could not hear any music or talking at night鈥?thanks to the nicely insulated windows. We felt safe strolling about the neighborhood at 10, 11 PM. There were small shops close by where we purchased water, snacks and fruit. Gelaterias near the station offered tasty gelato and low-cost sandwiches. We found ATMs, Internet shops, travel agencies and a good number of restaurants within a three block radius of the hotel. One restaurant, only a half block away, featured hearty pizza and traditional Italian fare, at a discount to the hotel guests. Our room was in the back of the hotel. It was very clean, tastefully furnished, and considerably larger than many of the hotel rooms we stayed in Europe. The bathroom, in contrast, was quite narrow. The sink, bidet, toilet, and shower lined up right next to each other. The fixtures were relatively new and functional. Great water pressure, and no lack of hot water. With two large windows that opened, our laundry dried overnight. Everyday of our stay, we found 4 sets of oversized and thick towels in our room. The AC was very effective, quiet, and adjustable. The large dresser offered ample room to hang our outfits, and still accommodated two carry-on suitcases inside. We had a LCD panel TV with CNN in English. The beds were comfortable and large (1 queen and 1 twin). Extra pillows and blankets could be found in the dresser drawers. Breakfast was included in the price of the room, offering simple choices of dry cereal, rolls, orange juice, milk, tea and coffee.Overall, the location of the Montreal is excellent, the room more than adequate, and the rate absolutely reasonable. But what makes the Montreal a great find is the service. Stefania, Monica, and a couple of gentlemen behind the front desk were always courteous, cheerful and helpful. The ladies serving at the breakfast bar were equally professional and pleasant. There is no doubt that when we return to Florence, we鈥檒l stay at Hotel Montreal.

<Content>We loved the Montreal!       The bed was a little uncomfortable (i.e., hard), but not horrible.

<Content>Brilliant value for money We booked 5 nights on [----] which was excellent as you can pay cash on departure rather than pay when you book. They did say on check out that in high season they would charge the first night to your credit card. We booked a double room with an ensuite, which was newly decorated. There was a little balcony which was also quite handy for airing the room. Flat screen tv to view above the bed. I really liked the large shower which had hot water when needed unlike some 4 star hotels I have previously stayed at! I really liked the decor and highly recommed staying there.We had breakfast there 2 mornings, which was good service. I usually drink english tea but being in Italy it is always best to go for the coffee option. Not a massive choice, cereal/pastries/rolls but was ok. Location very near the station, just round the corner to get tthe shutle bus back to Pisa airport very handy. Easy walking distance to the attractions.

<Content>Excellent hotel and value We have just returned from a four night stay at the Montreal Hotel in Florence. It more than lived up to our expectations - it is very close to the railway station (which was welcome as we caught the train from Pisa airport) and close to all the major sights in Florence. The staff on the desk were all very friendly and spoke good English. The room we had (room 301) was quite large for a budget hotel and had an ensuite bathroom (which was well equipped but on the small side - more than adequate however). We were on the third floor (up two flights of steps after taking the lift to the first floor) and overlooked the side street. The windows were triple glazed so we heard nothing once they were closed. A very good self service breakfast and very friendly staff in the breakfast lounge. I would definitely use the hotel again and would recommend it.

<Content>great location This hotel was in a great location, it was only 5 mins from the Santa Maria Novella train station. We were greeted by an un-excited staff member who couldnt be bothered with a smile.The rooms were very basic but were spacious and had air-con...during the 40 degree heatwave it was amazing. We stayed in a quad room for 120 Euro which included breakfast. Breakfast was good, traditionally Italian and the lady who served us was the only friendly person in the whole place. There was a communal fridge on the first floor which was always full. Hotel Montreal was good value for money and I would stay there again.

<Content>Inexpensive, Near Train Station We stayed in a double room with shared bath at the Hotel Montreal in mid-November.The hotel staff was friendly, arranging a cab for us to go to the airport, and the room was small but clean.Towels and clean linens were included in the price, and the room featured a sink. Shared accommodations for bath and toilet were located nearby on the same floor. Pretty much what you would expect for a 50 euro double very closed (just a few minutes) from the train station.
