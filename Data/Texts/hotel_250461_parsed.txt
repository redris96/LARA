<Content>Great Christmas Stay! We've had an excellent stay at the NH-HOTEL FRIEDRICHSTRASSE in Berlin, for 10 days during Christmas 08! Actually, we've just returned today! The personnel was very polite and helpful, the room very clean and taken care of everyday by the staff (fresh towels and bed linen, fresh coffee cups, etc). It had a convenient size, medium to large (for the european standards) with a small built-in kitchen that made things very easy for having a coffee whenever you wanted to. Usually in the morning before leaving our room, as we did not wanted to pay for breakfast or in the evening when returning to the hotel very tired. Very well decorated room with a nice aura. The building is new, with huge glass windows. Very modern. The location is GORGEOUS, next to everything! The best place to stay in eastern Berlin. We couldn't have done a better choice in that. Located literally one step away from the Friedrichstrasse S-Bahn train station. Our room was on the 6th floor, facing Friedrichstrasse, so we had no noise at all. Many times we were leaving the window open as we had a smoking room, but still nothing annoyed us terribly, neither the noise from the trains nor the street noises. Do choose it for many reasons. I would have written a huge list here with the advantages if I could! I will definitely book there again in my next visit to Berlin. I would like to thank the personnel for their excellent assistance! Wish we could return quickly! We had a great Christmas time in gorgeously different Berlin! Have a great new year!

<Content>fantastic location This hotel is in a fantastic location. It is just across the road from the Friedrichstrasse U-Bahn and S-Bahn so it is very easy to get to. A 2 minute walk and you are on Unter den Linden and it's just a 10 minute walk to the Brandenburg gate and the Reichstag building. The staff were extremely efficient and helpful. After saving on accommodation on other parts of our trip, we splashed out and booked a junior suite. We don't know what the standard rooms are like but the junior suite was fantastic. Breakfast is expensive at 19 euros so we booked a room without breakfast. There are many breakfast options nearby including a bagel place right next door and many other eateries nearby. There is no free internet but time can be purchased at reception.

<Content>Excellent location, not very personal This hotel is obviously a hotel for business people, allthough a lot of tourist book it too. It is wel taken care of, with very nice rooms, spacious bathrooms. But it misses a personal touch, that you find in smaller, boutique like, hotels. The staff is very kind and helpful, but because it is so large (about 300 rooms) you have no personal connection to the people who work there, at the reception for example. The location is excellent though. It is situated right next to the station Friedrichstrasse, so only 50 meters to U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams, trains, busses. In walking distance of Unter den Linden, Museum Insel, Gendarmenmarkt, etc. A lot of possibilities to have breakfast in the area. Restaurants nearby or one stop to Hackische hofe with the S-bahn.Actually, this location creates one more set back: trains come by and make noise. If you like to have a bit of fresh air at night, it is a bit noisy.

<Content>Great Location and value for money The hotel is situated in a fantastic location, close to all the 'spots' that visitors would want to check out, which means that you can pretty much walk to most places. It is also very accessible to the Berlin Schoenefeld airport (being across the road from the main train line). It is extremely well maintained and appears to be relatively new. Would def recommend to friends and family visiting Berlin.

<Content>Travel lodge in Berlin! This was a modern, clean hotel in a central location, perfect for catching the S and U bahn around Berlin on a short city break. We booked 4 nights on a mystery hotel deal for a 4* hotel. Our ensuite bathroom had everything we needed, as did the minialist room but it really did feel like a travel lodge in terms of quality. Although we requested a double bed, ours was a twin room with beds put together and single bed linen. A word of warning that if you are looking for glamour or personal service, this is not the hotel for you!

<Content>great hotel, one major problem The hotel is very good, the location is great, the price is good but we experienced one big problem with the bed mattress which was so soft and made my husband a backache that lead him to sleep on the floor, we checked other rooms mattresses as well even the deluxe room, they were all the same, so you have to know it is not good for those with sensitive backs untill they will renew the mattresses

<Content>Nice and convenient stay in Berlin First I'd like to recommend if you are coming from Tegel (TXL) airport that you take Bus 128 to Kurt-Shumacher-Platz U-Bahn station, then south to Friedrichstrasse stop. We took the TXL bus coming in and it took a while in traffic as well as you had to hoof it from Unter den Linden. This was just a one night place for us. I love Berlin it has so much history and Friederichstrasse was on the border with the old East Germany. The hotel is fairly modern and contemporary. The check in staff were quite professional and answered all questions with care. I faile to get one young ladies name but she was quite cordial. Another girl who I spoke with seemed to be bothered but she didn't ruin my overall impression of the desk. The room was spacious enough, high ceilings, modern bathroom. Beds were comfy, duvets a bit too warm. Many amenities in this place. I did not take the breakfast because I thought 19 euros was an outrageous price. We just stepped out the front door to the right and grabbed a quick breakfast at the bagel shop next door. They have an internet service next to the checkin but 5 euros was a bit pricey for only 30 minutes! Note the couple ATM's close to the hotel (across the street in the station, it's at the Postbank) because if you go to Brandenburg Gate or Bundestag area there seemed to be virtually no banks on Unter den Linden in that direction. They will store your luggage at no cost if you have a flight that is much later than your checkout whic allowed us to see more of Berlin! I was a satisfied customer!

<Content>Good Tourist Hotel We are just back from a week in Berlin staying at the Jolly Vivaldi Hotel. I would rate this hotel as 4* because of the room faciliteis, efficient staff, all of whom spoke English and the excellent breakfast. The Concierge was extremely helpful and would recommend and book restaurants etc. The Bar prices were expensive but the staff were efficient and friendly which made having a nightcap in the Bar worth the additional expence. The location of the Hotel is excellent being close to many Museums etc. Be aware however that there are problems at present on the S - Bahn services and it took two changes of Trains to reach Friederichstrasse Station. Returning to Schronefeld Airport involved a change from S - Bahn to Shuttle Bus. As all announcements were in German only this was a little problematic. The whole Trip, our 2nd was most enjoyable and I would thoroughly recommend the Jolly Vivaldi Hotel,

<Content>Ideal location for tourists. The hotel is ideally located for tourists, just beside the Freidrichstrasse station. It is only a few minutes' walk from the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate, and the Pergamon museum. Staff were efficient and polite. The rooms were quiet (we requested a quiet room) and ours overlooked an interior courtyard. The rooms were spacious and had a minibar and tv (mainly German language channels). The nearby train station is only across the road and is a convenient means of transport to the Schonefeld Airport via the S9.

The Hotel itself is German contemporary, nice Lobby, excellent German breakfast is served in a spacious airy nice natural light rest. in hotel. Get the breakfast w/your room for sure. The rooms are clean, well designed, nice flat screen TV and decent bathroom. BuT tthe best part of this hotel is LOCATION !! It is 100 feet waay from main Berlin train station, located walking distance to several excellent restaurants, near a main shopping corridor, an easy walk to the Reichstag and B-Gate. Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly and were very cute w/their english usage, which was usually an amusing experience. Overall...Gut !!!

<Content>Excellent location I was very worried about our visit as there was a bus, tram and underground strike but the location was great. Out out of the station and one minute later we were in reception checking in. We arrived approx 10:00 am and our room was available. We overlooked the railway but we did not find this a problem and hardly heard any trains, but we are heavy sleepers !!.Staff were helpful when we asked for advice and we did not have any reason for complaint. We had a late flight home and they looked after our cases for us so we could enjoy our last day without having to carry them around with us all day.Very satisfied and happy with this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Mitte Location This was our first trip to Belin and we'd recommend this hotel. You are in a perfect spot for tourism, as it is in the Mitte portion of town and right off the S-bahn. We were able to access anything by foot from the hotel!Checking in our room was not ready, which seemed to be the norm for our stay here, but all in we'd recommend the hotel.The lobby area is a nice place to read/relax in with very updated decor. The breakfast is in a large courtyard with many options in the buffet.The room was plenty big, very clean and offered good business services.

<Content>Clean and well located hotel This hotel is a very well located hotel. It is just outside the Friedrichstrasse U/S-Bahn (one stop from the Berlin Main Station) making it really easy to go anywhere in Berlin. Its only a 10 min walk to the Brandenburg Gate/Reichstag and a 20 min walk to the Musuem Island. We walked to these attractions even in the heart of a cold december day! Lots of food places to eat around the hotel as well. The rooms in the hotel are very spacious, modern and clean. Beds were very comfortable too making it a great hotel to stay in. The only complaint is that the showers and kettle leaks. Hopefully they would've fixed it by now!

<Content>Not worthy of 4* Receptionist couldn't speak English. That's OK since this is Germany - for a two star hotel. Not a four star hotel in the centre of Berlin. And she also sent me to the wrong room by writing the wrong room number on the card. And (by asking one of the guests in the queue for checkin to translate) she told me that the Internet was broken and had been all day. I'd been in the hotel 5 minutes and I hated it already.In fact, the Internet didn't work for the complete stay. According to reception they were waiting for an engineer to come from Italy to fix it. This would have been amusing had I not been on a business trip and rely on Internet access at every hotel I stay in - it certainly advertised broadband Internet access in every room on the web site.The rooms are OK, but not great - average TV, no place to rest your luggage except on the furniture, quite noisy with the train station next door... ...really, not very four star at all.And 鈧?9 for a bowl of fruit for breakfast? I won't be staying here again.

<Content>Superb spot Previous reviews on this hotel and a decent rate were the reasons that we booked to stay here. We were not let down. From the moment we arrived, a speedy less than 5 minute check in to the moment we departed everything seemed to be effortless. Has almost everything you would want from a hotel while on a city break and good value for a 4star. Very clean, neat, comfortable bed, nice bathroom and excellent location. Without sounding negative, note I still rate this hotel as Excellent, rooms do not have tea and coffee making facilities, something we have taken to be a norm while staying in other hotels. Although there is a coffee shop next door to the hotel so this can easily be fixed. Also the price of breakfast at 19 Euro per head is extortionate and unless it鈥檚 included in your hotel deal go outside. Breakfast in Berlin is served until around 4pm and there are many places to choose from around the city. Location wise you would do well to find somewhere better. The Hotel is less than 1 minute walk to Friedrichstra脽e train and underground station, is on the main street in Berlin and within 30 mins you could walk to 5 districts around the centre. Opposite the hotel there are a number of restaurant / bars housed under the railway track arches. The two I would recommend are Leon for great burgers, and the Twelve Apostles Italian where they serve 12 types of pizza named nearly after the 12 apostles. But first I would walk (30 mins) or take the underground (10 mins) to Prenzlauer Berg where there are so many nice eateries and bars to choose from. Overall Berlin is an impressive City and the hotel Vivaldi does it justice!

<Content>Good Hotel Booked this hotel through Venere.com and reserved two rooms. On arrival the hotel had only one room held but after some discussion said they had another available which they could let us have. A bit worrying! Hotel is well located across the road from friedrich strasse S Bahn/U Bhan station. Leave station by the friedrich strasse exit and turn right and then the hotel is just across the street. The rooms are very good, clean modern and with a very good bathroom with excellant shower. Flat screen TV mini bar and trouser press (the most useless piece of equipemnt in any hotel - an iron and board is far better). Didn't eat in the hotel there are plenty of options outside. Small bar, chic and very nice. Strangely it was closing one night before 11.00pm as we returned to the hotel and we couldn't get a drink - all the staff were off early for their Christmas bash. Never came across that one before. But any gripes are minor this is a good hotel near the Unter den Linden and Brandenburg Gate. Checkpoint Charlie is 20/25 minutes walk away or 3 stops on the U Bahn. Belin is great for Christmas markets with a big one on the Unter den Linden. really enjoyed the three day break in a good base.

<Content>Great location, boring room Excellent position esp for first visit, make sure you get the S train from Schonefeld airport and not the slow one, exit is almost opposite hotel. Hotel was v clean, roomy but we found the beds very hard. It was quite impersonal, felt like a business hotel, no character in rooms but functional and position ideal. Lots of cafes nearby for a cheaper breakfast. Many sights within walking distance, Brandenburg Gate, Museum Island, Checkpoint Charlie, Jewish Museum and Hackesher Hofe. Staff tried to be helpful but their English was not that good, also it was very cold while we were there and we came back in the evening to find that the maid had left window open all day, temperature outside was below freezing. Overall recommended though, there is a very slight noise from the trains but prob not enough to disturb slumbers. We booked through venere.com and all worked smoothly LLTT

<Content>Good Hotel (when you get to stay) As other reviewers have mentioned, this Hotel has a great location when arriving from Schonefield airport, train station right outside the door just take the S9 direct. Having booked this Hotel on 1800 Hotels website last June and prepaid, we were extremly annoyed to find that our room overbooked and the first night of our weekend break we had to move on down the road to the Maritim Hotel. Maritim was fine, very clean, fantastic breakfast. We moved back to the Jolly at last! We had a complimentary bottle of champagne when we finally got our room on Saturday afternoon which was a nice touch. This hotel is very clean, rooms are as you would expect from a 4 star, no problem with noise had one facing courtyard, nice sitting area in room. Breakfast was fine - nothing outstanding, was included in our booking would not be worth an extra 19 euro, as plenty of cafes around.We dined in this area all nights and found plenty of nice restaurants, found the 12 apostles pizzeria 5 mins walk turn right and walk along railway line very convenient.This Hotel is in a great location did the walking tour on Saturday with New Berlin Tours very interesting, Berlin is a great city, some lovely shops, and a lot of history.

<Content>Great hotel One of the smoothest stays we have had in a hotel. We booked 3 nights and got a junior suite on the first level facing the Mitte (the city centre). Despite being opposite the train station and the tube, the area was quiet and safe. The receptionists were really friendly, the room and the bathroom was spotless and we had a small chocolate waiting for us each day we returned to our room. The hotel itself was very central - off Friedrichstr. and close to all amenities and on the direct line to Schonefeld airport. Breakfast was offered for additional 19 Euros but we skipped it, as cheaper and tasty alternatives were available outside.

<Content>Pretty good with a couple of minor caveats I stayed here for four nights from 10th to 14th October.The rooms and bathrooms are large, clean and modern. The location is excellent. You are 10 minutes walk from the Brandenburg Gate/Reichstag, 20 minutes from Museum Island, 15 minutes from Checkpoint Charlie and about 30 minutes from Alexanderplaz.It's 10 minutes to good pubs on Oranienburger Strasse and there are plenty of places to eat across all price ranges near the hotel (plus a great Starbucks right on the corner).There is a fantastic walking tour I'd highly recommend leaving from outside Bandy Brooks, a shop on the corner of the hotel itself.The hotel is located just across from Friedrichstrasse U bahn/S bahn which is convenient for travel. This would be one of only two caveats. I was at the back of the hotel and unless my window was open I couldn't hear the trains at all. On the front or side of the hotel though you directly face the station and noise might be a problem. Having said that mind, the windows had the thickest double glazing I've seen in my life so you might be okay but all the same I'd ask for a rear facing room rather than take the risk.My only other caveat is an increasingly common issue with hotels. Hotels the world over I find far too hot and I like a really cool room if I'm going to get any sleep. This hotel did have air conditioning but like many you couldn't reduce the setting low enough to cool the room: the air conditioning was in effect turned off (no doubt to save money) and ll you could do was get the fan to blow out some barely cool air that made no impact on the room temperature.That said, I suspect 9 out of 10 people will like their room warmer than I do so should have no problem.All in all I'd definitely go back. The location makes it a winner.

<Content>Great, relaxing stay in Berlin! It's not a five star hotel, but it gets a 5.0 here because the stay was excellent. I traveled with two other people, and we had a two room suite which was spacious, comfortable, and totally relaxing. It was a great sanctuary to return to after a long day of sightseeing (or beer drinking). Little touches such as Baci candies by the bedside or the shoe buffer in the hallway were great. Our TVs were all flat screen, which was nice, and the windows were so big and heavy that you could barely hear any street noise.Wi-Fi was very expensive, but there's a nice little bagel shop downstairs and adjacent to the hotel (literally the next door over), and for two Euros, we were able to purchase an hour of Wi-Fi. (The bagels were good too).There was plenty of closet space, a safe in the room, and a nifty electric teapot. Most importantly, it was clean, roomy, and comfortable.Location was excellent too. Being next to a major S-bahn and U-bahn station was tremendous. Most of the best Mitte sights were within walking distance, and if they weren't, well, just hop on the train.I'd definitely stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>A gem in central Berlin Having only two days to see Berlin, my wife and I were looking for a central location easily accessible by public transportation. The Jolly Hotel Vivaldi is excellent for this purpose. It is high quality, affordable and immediately adjacent to the S-bahn and U-bahn. You can walk to the Brandenburg gate, and have easy access to some the greatest musems in Berlin. The staff is good, the rooms are very nice and suprisingly quiet for the location. This is a great value for Berlin. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>What a great find This was the most fabulous hotel we stayed in during our recent trip to Europe. And, the most reasonable! First off, the rooms are very modern and comfortable and have the softest beds I have ever slept on! Bathroom was excellent too. The steam and sauna are wonderful. The location is unbeatable, close to trams, subways, etc. and even walking distance to a lot of major sights. I hate commuting so sometimes I just walked. Just north of the river, you have a wonderful selection of bars, cafes, restaruants etc. I have only good things to say about this hotel, but, if you are looking for a quaint, charming, European hotel, this is not for you. It's quite generic (not that bothered me since there is so much wonderful stuff outside the hotel that it's great to be comfortable in your hotel) and could be anywhere in the world.

<Content>Ideal base for short and first-time visits This is an ideal base if you are travelling to Berlin for the first time or for a short visit and is a better location than nearby Hackescher Markt itself because it opens out into the rest of the city in ways that make it easy for travellers to see the very best of Berlin. Friedrichstrasse is a long street that connects the old west and east sides of the city, and used to be a crossing point when the wall was still in existence. The area has a laid back atmosphere with a few nice cafes and is a good place to return to after an evening out. From here, Hackescher Markt, Oranienburger Strasse and Unter den Linden are within easy walking distance through interesting streets. It is also easy to walk westwards from here to the Brandenburg Gate and onwards towards Tiergarten. Friedrichstrasse station has transport lines running through the east and west of the city and there is also a tram stop nearby so it's possible to walk out of the hotel, cross the road and get to anywhere in the city very quickly. The S-Bahn from Friedrichstrasse will take you west along this route to Tiergarten and Zoo Garden Station near the big shopping street of Kufurstendamm or east to Hackescher Markt (one stop) and surrounding areas. This location is especially good if you are flying into Schonfeld which has a direct train line to Friedrichstrasse station (allow 50mins to 1 hr). The hotel has excellent service; very good bright rooms that are well-airconditioned; friendly and helpful staff; and an excellent breakfast buffet with endless supplies of good coffee and a wide variety of food choices. A good breakfast can be bought for a lot less in nearby cafes so getting value from the hotel buffet is dependent on how much you're able to eat first thing in the morning. The atmosphere in the hotel is calm and relaxed and there is no discernible noise from the station in the rooms at night because of soundproofed windows. This is an excellent choice of hotel for short and first-time visits.

<Content>great hotel, great city We stayed at this hotel April 2007 for a couple of nights. We arrived at the check-in earlier than expected so our room was not ready. They offered us a superior room which was ready to occupy for a reasonable extra sum. The suite was large and luxurious. The hotel is exceptionally good value, serving a delicious buffet breakfast in a bright large glass roofed room. The staff were friendly and very helpful, and the location was excellent - for walking to nearby sights or for using the train station on the doorstep.

<Content>Nearly Perfect The reviews do not lie! For all-round good value I would doubt it is difficult to beat without entering the deluxe price bracket. The location can surely not be beaten if you are looking for a central tourist hotel. Situated across the street from Friedrichstrasse station and connections everywhere (including direct S9 and Airport Express train from Schonefelde airport.) About 5 to 10 minutes equidistant stroll away from Unter den Linden, Museum Island and the bars/restaurants on Oranienburgerstrasse. The room was scrupulously clean, very comfortable and, despite Intercity express trains passing literally about 100 metres away, the triple-glazing meant a blessed silence for a great night's sleep. The clientele seemed to be business people and folk of a certain age so no rowdies in the corridors during the night. If I had to be picky, I would give the breakfasts a miss. Yeah, good food and a wide choice but, at 19 euros, a wee bit pricey by Berlin standards and the dining area was very busy with business people. We had to hunt not only for a seat but a glass and also share a knife. And the tea wasn't great either!!

<Content>Well-located and modern, jolly times Excellent hotel in a great location surrounded by a lot of new, modern buildings and designer shops nearby. Easy to find, just next to the Friedrichstrasse station, and a 5 minute walk to Unter den Linden. Highly convenient for taxis, public transport (S and U Bahns), and local shopping and restaurants. The room was spacious and very quiet, and the bed was comfortable; expect a deep sleep.The staff were exceptionally helpful and recommended a wonderful restaurant after the one we wanted to go to was fully booked. Check-in and -out was efficient and, as is usual, we were able to leave our bags at the hotel for the day whilst wandering around the city.I've stayed at many hotels before, and this was one to recommend for cleanliness, comfort and convenience. Don't expect a hotel that oozes local charm - you could be anywhere in the world - but its perfect if modern convenience is what you're looking for.

<Content>Great Hotel for Tourism Jolly Hotel Vivaldi is part of a well respected Italian chain of worldwide hotels. In Berlin, the hotel is a perfect choice for tourists. The rooms are large and well maintained, with turndown service at night. My only complaint with the room was the shower / tub combo did not have a shower door or curtain, rather a small glass partition which allowed water to splash all over the bathroom floor. This problem I have seen througout Europe in other countries, so Europeans must know how to take a shower without spraying water all over the place (I assume).The concierge staff was very helpful and spoke many languages, including English, German and Italian. The location is perfect, with the Unter Den Linden and Brandenberg Gate within walking distance in one direction from the hotel, and the Museum Island including the Pergamon Museum (my favorite) in the other direction. Also if you continue past the Museum Island on foot, you will come to the Hackensemarket area which has a glut of trendy restaurants and lounges within the yuppiefied Mitte district. It is a perfect way to start out your night with a good meal and maybe some live music. The Hotel is across the street from the Friedrichstrasse S and U Bahn station, making it perfect to get around the city. Plus if you want to take a trip out of town (such as to Dresden or Prague) there is a Deuteche Bahn office in the Friedrichstrasse station as well.Overall an excellent stay over the New Years celebrations in Berlin and I would definitely stay there again. It lives up to the American standard of hotels such as Marriott and Hilton.

<Content>Perfect Husband, son and myself stayed 3 Dec for 3 nights.Used their airport pick up service and the driver was waiting at the airport for us, 19 euros. He gave a running commentary on sites we passed along the way.Location is definitely a plus.Hotel clean, staff brilliant, food brilliant.Was initially concerned about reviews of rooms on train station side but the triple glazing ensured we were not disturbed.We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Nice hotel, shame about the WLAN Stayed 3 nights recently at this hotel. The hotel itself is great - nice location, great restaurant and fantastic breakfast, all for 鈧?18 a night.My only two gripes:- online access was not available in all rooms. I was lucky - see below - but several customers of mine who were visiting from the US were not so lucky, even after being moved twice.- online access costs - hold your breath - 鈧?5!!! For two hours 40 minutes!!!- and the best bit - if you forget to log-off and leave the room as I did, the credit gets used up and you need to pay again. The online access goes over an Italian service provider, but after 3 phone calls with my new friend Francesco at their hotline, the issue couldn't be resolved. The hotel staff were also unable to help me.So, my recommendation - sit in the lobby to pick up mails etc., and log onto the Wireless LAN of the coffee shop next door, which is AOL based.

<Content>Nice hotel in a good location Best brand hotel I've stayed in this year. Hard to find fault particularly as we got upgraded to a suite. Right next to Friedrichstrasse train station but the excellent soundproofing meant that we hardly heard anything.For the same price as a standard room + breakfast you can get a superior room. Do yourself a favour and get a superior room with no breakfast and then go next door to Starbucks for breakfast.Underground parking was expensive (鈧?0 pd) but very convenient as it was right under the hotel.A short walk away is Oranienburgerstrasse which really buzzes at night.

<Content>Beware Overbooking The hotel staff was wonderful, and the location is just about perfect. The only problem is that we had BOOKED AND PAID FOR OUR ROOMS FOUR MONTHS IN ADVANCE. When we arrived, we were told one of our rooms was not available, and that we would have to double up. They offered us a breakfast voucher, which the management churlishly withdrew when we asked for a refund on the room which we had paid for but did not get to use. Strongly suggest you confirm your reservation, and get the NAME of the person who confirms it. The hotel sold our room twice, and had apparently intended to keep the money from both guests. This is a low-rent practice, which we did not expect at such an otherwise EXCELLENT hotel

<Content>Don't be put off by the Name Jolly sound very twee but it ain't. Extremely well placed for walking everywhere or taking the S or U bahn trains. It's the best location for tourists. The hotel itself is great, friendly staff, good breakfast, quiet and cool room. We were upgraded to a Junior suite for an extra 20euros a night and it was great. Better choice of TV stations in English would have helped but that's about as bad as it got! Highly recommended.

<Content>fantastic! I stayed at the Jolly four days, and I really enjoyed my stay!They gave me a room on the station side but I didn't noticed all the noises that other reviewers reported.The room was soundproof and everything was ok. A superb breakfast was waiting for us in the morning. Good variety of food and buffet was never empty. Service was excellent and fast. All the hotel was spotless. And I have also enjoyed the beautiful wellness area with sauna, jacuzzy and solarium.In addition the location was excellent. I have just one remark, the garage is too expensive. 20 euros per night are too much! I have found a public parking just around the corner for the price of 10 euros per night. So I suggest you to do the same. (it is only two minutes walk).I will recommend this hotel to anyone and I will come again in the future.

<Content>The Fabulous Jolly Vivaldi !! I stayed at this hotel 8th to 10th July 06. As previous reports have said, this hotel is all about location, location, location! It is directly at Frederichstrasse Railway Station, its just a 10 minute walk from the Brandenburg Gate and Check Point Charlie. The hotel staff were superbly efficient, nothing was too much trouble for them. It is worth paying a 20 Euro upgrade fee for a Superior Room, they have flatscreen tv and are very modern, also ask for a room not facing the station, those rooms will be noisy because of the passing trains every minute night and day. The hotel is about a 25 minute journey from Tegel Airport, a taxi will cost between 16 and 20 Euros. I will defintely choose to stay at the Vivaldi again, you can make your booking with total confidence, go to the hotel website at [------------------]

<Content>Family trip to Berlin We stayed here for three nights in two adjacent rooms.The location is excellent for access to the station (i.e. it is the next building to Freidrichrasse station). However despite the double glazing the noise of the trains is ever present. So if you can sleep through the noise the location is perfect for the public transport and only 10 minutes walk away are Brandenberg gate, Museum Island and definietely worth visiting is the Reichtstag. In fairness the double glazing does knock out 90% of the train noise, with all windows shut.The hotel staff were friendly and made an effort to show good service. The rooms were spotless, with room service each day.The bathrooms were ample with soaps and shower gels, decent shower and bath.The breakfasts have fruit and yoghurts, cold meats and cheeses, cereal and/ or a full cooked breakfast.We chose to eat evening meals at Restaurant  Cafe Pepita on Unter Den Linten (10 mins walk from the hotel). The menu caters for Italien, Spanish and German food with the menu being in German and English. The food was excellent and served promptly. The staff were very friendly.

<Content>Nice Hotel!! We stayed in the Jolly Vivaldi for 3 nights from 13th April 2006. Nice hotel and staff (we were incorrectly given a room with 2 single beds when we first arrived but this was quickly changed to a double when we queried this), very reasonable price and great location especially with the S-Bahn and U-Bahn right next door. The only downside I would say was breakfast. Although this was included in our price we thought the choice offered was poor. There are plenty of Cafes, Restaurants and Crepe Stalls around which would be far cheaper to eat at if breakfast is not included in your price. Having said that, if we were to go to Berlin again we would definitely consider staying at the Jolly Vivaldi again.

<Content>Beware overbooking We had a reservation - secured with a credit card for 2 nights 14-16 April. We had notified the hotel of our expected arrival time - 11pm.We arrived by taxi from the airport exhausted and looking forward to going to our room, taking a hot shower and getting some sleep.At reception as soon as I mentioned the booking it became obvious there was a problem. There was no room for us but they had booked another hotel down the street. No apology, no compensation for the inconvenience etc. It was late, I have limited mobility and made to feel I was making a fuss!!!At that time of night we had no other choice but to go to this other hotel.Compensation - 1 bottle of cheap wine  breakfast.If we had booked the alternative hotel ourselves it would have cost us less, instead we paid Jolly Hotel Vivaldi prices.We feel we have been ripped off!!!!!

The staff were really friendly and accommodating giving us a late checkout on our last day. The U-Bhan/S-Bhan system is very efficient and cheap too. Berlin in really cheap for food and drinks(even more so than Prague) and everyone is friendly and helpful.I thoroughly recommend this city to anyone!!

<Content>Good Location, Modern and Clean - Fear not to stay here I will try to touch on most things that other reviewers mention. The Jolly Hotel Vivaldi is a modern, clean hotel. The staff was very friendly. The lobby is nice, there's a Starbucks and a (what else) Italian restaurant. The location of the hotel is great for sightseeing and transportation. It's by the Friedrichstrasse S-bahn. Also on the train line for Schoenfeld airport. I really have no complaints about the hotel, everything was in working order, clean and in excellent condition. The minibar is a little sparse as well is the in room dining menu, television is your typcial european channels and given your in Germany primarily German channels. There is Pay Per View with quite a bit of selection. Breakfast is 18 Euros for which you get a very decent selection delivered to your room at the time you request it. The only negative I can find about the hotel is their internet connection. Given that I was in Berlin on a business trip, I needed high speed. They do have a wireless connection (no hard wired!!!) however it comes at a staggering cost. If I remember correctly you get 2 hours for 25 Euros, 5 or 6 hours for 50 Euros. For someone who's used to broadband 24 hour connection that's a bit steep. All in all this hotel is really nice, good location, friendly staff, well worth the money unless you need that internet connection. I am attaching a few pictures, you can tell that the place is nice. There's a welcome bottled water, bathrobes, slippers upon arrival and Baci chocolate each night.

<Content>a great location and a great hotel The best thing about this hotel is it's location.It's on Freidrichstrasse, which is one of Berlin's main streets. It is in the heart of the Mitte district, formally East Berlin, only 2 mins walk from Unter den linden which is Berlin's equivalent of the Champs Elysee in Paris. You can walk to a lot of the main sites of Berlin from here, for instance, the Brandenburg gate is only about 10 mins walk. If you need to go a little further a tram stops right outside the hotel and the Freidrichstrasse U-bahn  S-bahn station is next to the hotel also. You may hear the trains if you have the window open but closed we heard nothing and the rooms are air conditioned. The rooms are excellent. Clean, tastefully designed and with all the comforts you need. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it was a little pricey but the wine bar was very nice, with very friendly staff.For it's location alone I would stay here again.

<Content>Noisy rooms and too expensive The problem of this hotels is, that the standard rooms don`t have a second door between corridor and sleeping room. So it`s awfully noisy and you`ll wake up when your neighbours door slams shut, because the hotel has very heavy doors!!The location is fine, but it`s too expensive and the breakfast room is a litte bit too cool.

<Content>Very nice hotel in central location but a bit pricey This was my first hotel stay at the beginning of a 10 day trip across Germany and my first ever hotel stay in mainland Europe. As my introduction to mainland Europe, Germany, and Berlin, I have to say I was pretty happy with my stay at the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi. First off is the location. You are a stone's throw away from the Friedrichstrasse S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations which will get you pretty much anywhere in Berlin Mitte within 10-15 minutes. You are about a 5-10 minute walk from the intersection of FrStrasse  Unter den Linden and 10 minute walk from Museum Island. Second, the room was fabulous - a very large size for a European room, large bathroom, comfortable bed, and trendy furnishings, and well kept up. Third, the management was extremely nice and extremely helpful during my stay, providing good restaurant and activity recommendations, and helping me with a luggage problem I had at the airport. The only negative I had with the hotel were the extra charges. I had no problem paying the rate of 100 Euros a night. However, I had to make a considerable number of phone calls during my stay and could not for the life of me track down a phone card anywhere until the third day of my stay, so I was stuck using the hotel phone. Also, needed to use the hotel's internet service two or three times. The hotel charged A LOT for these services (more than expected), and it quickly added another 100 Euros to my final bill. Also, while traditional in Germany, no breakfast is included at the hotel. Finally, given its location, the area near the hotel is a bit noisy - and some of that carries into the rooms.The Jolly Hotel is nice, and I would certainly consider staying here on my next trip overseas. However, I would check prices at other hotels before settling in at the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi. Berlin is really not an overly expensive city and I'd be willing to bet you could find nearly as nice as this for a lower price.

<Content>Great location, quality hotel Stayed here the weekend before Christmas. This hotel is in an excellent location - we managed to walk nearly everywhere that we wanted to go, including the Christmas markets, Checkpoint Charlie, Potsdamer Platz, Brandenburg Tor, Berliner Dom. The room was very spacious and the shower was nice and powerful. All very clean and the triple glazing meant that we hardly heard the trains. Would recommend the restaurants across the river from Friedrichstrasse station. Very good food. Would not recommend the restaurant Nolle as it was just passable.Came here for my husband's 30th birthday and arranged for his family to surprise him later that day - unfortunately the receptionist ruined the surprise when we checked in by reading out the names of his family, despite giving her our full names to check. She wasn't to know but would have expected them to offer a gesture such as a round of drinks for the 6 of us as they did realise what they had done.There were no tea-making facilities in our room so we ordered room service. Later found out from other guests that we should have had them - tried to get room service refunded but to no avail - the receptionist's English wasn't good enough. I'm sure we could have got it back if we had insisted on speaking to someone else but we didn't want to create any more stress than needed for a few euros!Would definitely stay here again if we went back to Berlin.

<Content>Fab Location and Great hotel I just returned from Berlin and stayed at the Jolly for 4 nights last week [23-27].. It was in a great location, walking distance to everything. As mentioned in other reviews, no noise from the trains. Loads of things to do around - shopping, eating, drinking etc... Checkpoint charlie is on the same road, a bit of a walk [10mins]. The winter markes are all out and vibrant, loved it. There is a little crepe stand outside the hotel, perfect for breakfast and many choices for coffee around. The central station is like 15 seconds walk... it's right there! The room itself was good, a bit more spacious than most european standards. The service was great, they even cleaned our rooms in the night time when we went out! There is also a coffee maker in the room... All in all, great hotel and location indeed!

<Content>Great hotel, fab location We stayed 4 nights at the Vivaldi last weekend and had a great time. The room was spacious very clean and comfortable, the location was great ( great for museums and sightseeing, right next to one of the main stations and on one of the main streets but they have very good sound proofing so you would never know!)There are a few decent eating/ drinking places literally over the road, built under the railway. a couple are German style and one is Italian - we ate at a couple of them and they were really good (you do get the thunder of trains every so often tho!)I would also recommend a meal at Dressler on the Unter den Linden (about 5 - 10 mins walk away) it's very nice and the staff are lovely.

<Content>Excellent - good bed, silent and excellent sauna installation It may not be a luxury hotell, but the location is excellent for visiting the most touristy areas of the town (it is very close to the parlament, for example). The surroundings are very noisy (there is a railway + S-bahn station just beside the hotel), but our room was very soundproof, so the noise did not disturb us at all. My wife and I are very concerned about noise and we had a bad experience recently in another hotel, so the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi was a pleasent surprise for us; we used to stay out dancing tango until rather late at night, and could sleep until late next morning, without being disturbed by noise generated inside or outside the hotel.The room was OK and the bed was very comfortable.The sauna installations in the basement were excelent, with two saunas having different temperatures, and as small cold water pool and relax room with a sufficient supply of newspapers. (Sauna was open 6:30-10:30 and 18:00-22:00). Breakfast at the hotell may be a bit expensive, but in Berlin you can have excellent breakfasts in many caf茅s.

<Content>Great location My husband, two small children, dog and I recently spent one night at the Jolly Hotel. We thought it was a great value as far as the price of the room and location. We were initally worried about the proximity to the train station, but the rooms were completely soundproof. It was very clean and our room service meal was very good. We only had two complaints. One was that the hotel wanted to charge us 30 Euro for a baby bed. This seems a little expensive. We travel most every weekend and the most we've been charged in the past was 10 Euro. Our only other complaint was that we encountered a very rude staff member at the restaurant when trying to order room service from the restaurant menu instead of the room service menu. This has never been a problem at any other hotel. Everyone else we dealt with was professional and helpful.

<Content>very good hotel I relied on other tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed with this hotel. It is a new hotel - modern design and furnishings, comfortable room with nice reading area that was well lit, large bathroom. A friend was also staying here and opted for the superior room which was supplied with robe, slippers, small alcove. As others have mentioned, the hotel is very well located for walking to major sites including the staatsoper under den linden, which is not to be missed if you are an opera fan. It was also very pleasant when returning to the hotel to hear Vivaldi being played throughout the lobby.A few have complained about the cost of the buffet breakfast and room service also seemed very expensive. However with Starbucks practically off the lobby, Adams two steps away for a nice, reasonable breakfast, and an excellent bakery across the street, this was never a problem.Much as the convenience of the location is an asset, I was initially put off by it's location smack up against the S/U bahn overhead rails and station and the Dunkin'Donuts across the street. However when I was in my room, although I could see the overhead rail, the room was very quiet. I was also initially concerned that the area immediately to the north of the hotel looked a little dodgy under the rail tracks. In two minutes though, you are walking either to the museums or across the river to Oranienburger strasse with its touching Jewish Museum as well as lively restaurants and art galleries so it was never an issue. I also ate at an excellent if pricey Italian restaurant nearby, Bocca di Bacco, on Friedrichstrasse.My major complaint was that although I found the desk staff friendly and fluent in many languages, I did not get the early morning wakeup call I had requested the morning I was leaving. I would also suggest that if you are expecting a quaint romantic hotel, this is not it. If I were returning to Berlin though, I would probably choose this hotel again.

<Content>Very Good Hotel - Ideal Location - Great Staff My wife and I have just returned from Berlin where we stayed at the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi for three nights - hotel is very clean, staff very efficient and helpful - breakfast included in our price - through Airmiles - was bufffet style and very good. Location is perfect for Museum Island, Unter Den Linden, et al. Bars and restaurants locally are very good - especially the Bolle, it is opposite the hotel and is set in the railway arches - lovely atmosphere and decent prices - noise of trains above can be a little disturbing when one of the large regional expresses goes by.Also worth a visit is the Vietnam Restaurant which is opposite the main entrance to the Freidrichstrasse Rail Station - very pleasant staff and food was great.

Right next to the railway, but the double glazed windows meant we didnt hear a thing.Breakfast costs about 16 euros so instead we had coffee and pastry from one of the many shops nearby. We got a very cheap deal over the internet, about 拢60 I think. Excellent value for money and we would definitely stay there again.NB: The Brewers Berlin walking tour which was excellent leaves from right outside the hotel each day.
