<Content>Dodgy Area. Ok for a quick stop only. My wife and I only stayed in Frankfurt for one night. Its only a stones throw from the railway station so don't bother about getting ripped off by a cab driver. The hotel is very average in all areas. Its architecture is very bland and so are the rooms and service. Ok for a quick stop over. Frankfurt is a beautiful city, a great blend of old architecture and modern skyscrapers. The inner city area is surrounded by a beautiful park. We were travelling back to the hotel on foot, just after leaving this park we had to walk through the Red Light district for about 400m. It was full of prostitutes and low-lifes, even in the late afternoon. We did not realise that this area is only about 150m from the Intercity Hotel. Be careful if you go for a walk. Especially at night.

<Content>for the location alone .... my wife and I stayed at this hotel along with our 3yr old son when we visited the frankfurt christmas market. pamper you it will not. but for anyone who REALISTICALLY wants an adequate, reasonably priced clean hotel as a base for a short trip to frankfurt I couldn't recommend it more.arrived into hauptbahnhof from airport, track 15, turn left, out the door and hotel is across the road ... dont get any more convenient ... and is absolutely invaluable if an early morning departure flight is involved. rooms while not huge were adequate enough to fit 3 of us as well as copious amounts of christmas shopping. excellent irish pub; o'reillys; on other side of hauptbahnhof .... great food. while it is just around the corner from the red light district on kaiserstrasse, this does not mean; as some reviews lead you to believe; that you'll be surrounded by hookers or addicts. didnt encounter either the entire weekend and we walked the streets pretty late at night. major bonus for this hotel is the free travel pass for your stay. this is invaluable. also do not leave frankfurt without checking out die zwolf apostel brewery-pub ..great steaks...exceptional home brewed beer ..enjoy the trip.

<Content>Cheap for a reason....... I was staying at the InterCity for work, and having stayed previously at the InterContinental, it was of course always going to be different, but at half the cost it does represent good value. However......Check InVery long queue at check in as a large group was in front of me. This is a big hotel, with a very small check in desk. It took 30 minutes to reach the front of the queue. RoomDespite asking for an executive smoking room, on getting upstairs, it was clear that this was a non smoking floor. Don't get me wrong this is a good thing! For non smokers to be subjected to the stale rank smell of cigs is gross, so I asked to moved to a smoking floor. This was dealt with quickly and efficiently. The rooms are small, but well laid out...... just a bit tacky. Compare this to a Holiday Inn Express (same cost etc) and it just falls short. Old and slightly tired, woodchip on the walls, stains on the carpets. Having booked an exec room (same rooms but free wireless  minibar, bathrobe) none of this was available and therefore later, when I went on line having put on requested bath robe, had to get dressed and go to reception. The wireless just does not work. Could not logon at all and gave up. So, I took to my bed (twin room, very narrow single bed) only to realise that the mattress was PLASTIC!!!!!! This is completely horrible and resulted in my having a sweaty, and desperately uncomfortable night. Really really uncomfortable. I am neither incontinent nor a toddler and I felt slightly insulted about this. Only one, very flat pillow. The result? A complete failure by the hotel to provide me with what I was paying for..... a good nights sleep. NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE.A colleague had a really negative experience with the TV system. As there were no English channels, she signed in for Pay TV assuming it would be extra premium channels (Sky One, Comedy Channel, BBC etc) but was treated to a range of Porn. Take my word for it, she is no prude, but did not wish to pay for Porn she didn't want, but the hotel were totally intransigent about it. When I tried to sort this out at reception, another guest said he had had excactly the same issue. Please InterCity, all you have to do is list the Porn as Adult TV and you will not have angry, embarrassed guest demanding their money back to no avail!!Staff, breakfast  facilitiesStaff very polite at all times. Perfectly acceptable outdoor terrace with bar and large screen TV (football going on). Good breakfast choice, but room too small at busy periods and not refuelled efficiently. There is a gym and sauna, but I didn't try them out.LocationRight next to the station and walking distance to all of downtown Frankfurt.OverallI just can't stay somewhere twice where I cannot sleep. I was here to work..... and ended up feeling tired and not on form during meetings. Next time I will justify the extra cost and stay somewhere else.

<Content>Avoid this hotel Yesterday I was in Frankfurt on business and was booked into the Intercity Hotel across from the train station. I only hope that the company saved money, because comfort was certainly not an issue.It is true that one hears no train noise. However, the noise inside the hotel is considerable. Doors banging, closets in the adjacent room opening, elephantine footsteps on the next floor, etc.I was given a room on the ground floor, where in case of fire the door to the bar/lobby is not allowed to be shut (I tried); ergo I was treated gratis to a concert of loud-mouthed drinkers until 1 a.m. To balance that out, the maids started rattling glassware, carts, etc., at 6:30 a.m. One of them tried to enter my room before 9 a.m. But the real kicker was the TV unexpectedly waking me at 6 a.m. I turned it off, fuming at a system which allowed the instructions of a previous guest to disturb my sleep. Unsuccessfully wooed Morpheus until 7:30 a.m. when the TV blared again. This time I called the receptionist, who, flustered, assured me someone would come to check. Thirty minutes later, having given up hope of succour and still gamely trying to rest, I received a call from the front desk saying I had neglected to press the OK button for a call left the previous evening, therefore the TV would continue to remind me. (At midnight when I entered my room, the omniscent TV had told me that a call had come. In vain I sought information from the TV and from the front desk. I was assured no call had come. Not true.)Even the manager attempted (admittedly, in not quite in so many words) to persuade me that these disturbances of sleep were my fault for having failed to press the OK button (also not true). Should I add that the remote control for the television was far from self-explanatory?Another colleague was awakened at 3 a.m.! But at least only once.I had to request that the soap containers be filled. No shower caps, shampoo, etc. Drains sluggish. Pillow was thin, although upon request an extra was provided. The A/C did work. The only other positive aspect was the not-quite-automatic offer of a free CombiTicket for public transportation. I received one at check-in, but other colleagues had to ask for it.One expects no better from the former proprietors of this hotel chain, but it is now owned and operated by the Steigenberger group. From THEM even transient guests should expect more.

<Content>Good hotel and location but beware of unexplained rate increases. The Intercity Hotel is a cozy, comfortable hotel in the heart of Frankfurt. I found the staff to be very helpful and pleasent. The rooms were small, but that seems to be standard for Europe. The only problem I had was when I booked I booked in for a rate of 79euro a night and ended up being charged 92euros a night. I was unable to rectify this with the hotel, probably due to the laguage barrier (I cannot speak German at all). And I did not have a print out of my booking to prove what I was supposed to pay. Otherwise it was a very pleasent experience. Just make sure you have proof of what your rate is supposed to be.

<Content>Good hotel for travelers Conveniently located across the street from the Hauptbahnhof, hotel guests get a pass that gives them free access to all the various public transportation around Frankfurt, including to the airport. We did a lot of hopping on and off the U-bahn to get around town. Our room was quiet even though we were so close to the train station.The hotel has entire floors that are non-smoking, and we found a yummy Thai restaurant just around the corner. The hotel restaurant has an extensive buffet for breakfast - much more than we needed, but we tried it once. Dinner was good there, too. If you get a call while you are out, the TV is on in your room displaying the message - nice way to not miss anything important.

<Content>Would recommend this hotel Location: Excellent. Right across the street from the main train station. In the heart of the city centre. Within walking distance to everything. Easy access to all forms of public transportation if you need to go outside of the downtown area.Room: Small. Bed and sheets are clean but carpets and walls are a bit stained and dusty. No amenities provided in the bathroom. Shower is small. No bath.Service: Excellent. Everyone at front desk speaks excellent English and is very friendly and helpful.Other: They provide a complimentary transportation pass for your stay so you can access public transportation for free.Restaurants: Adolf Wagner. Wega. Just off Schweizer Platz station. Highly recommend both.Overall: Would stay here again because of the location or for a short stay. Not suitable for a romantic getaway or a longer-term stay. And to respond to previous about safety of the location - I found it was totally fine. It is just off the red light district - unlike other hotels who are right in the midst of it. There are a few unsavory individuals that hang out right outside the main entrance to the railway station (very few and they will not bother you) but use the side entrance across from the hotel and you will avoid them if it concerns you.

<Content>Great hotel for pets. We loved this hotel. The location is great, right by the main train station (Haupt Bahnhoff). The lobby was large, clean and inviting. The hotel has a nice restaraunt and a cute little fitness area.  The room was clean and the shower pressure was amazing! The staff was very friendly and gave us no problems about our dog. If you are looking for a cheap, basic hotel that is not dirty, weird, or scary this is definitly the one. On the other hand if you are expecting the marriot or hilton you will be disappointed. There is no room service and the room is not very large. Also there were a lot of people doing drugs on the street near the hotel. You never felt in danger because there are also lots of tourists and business people around too. Also the wireless internet was not working while we were there. I would most definitly stay here again. I totally loved it. I also will stay in the intercityhotel in other cities too. You get a free ticket for all the trains in town because it is owned by the train company.

<Content>It was an OK place to stay... We stayed here mainly because we needed a cheap overnight hotel before our flight out of Frankfurt AM Main. It's fairly convenient via train (only about a 15 minute ride), but buying the train tickets can be a challenge if you've never done it before. The location is superb, as the hotel is right outside of the Main train station. The staff at the hotel were friendly. The room was clean, but the carpeting could have used replacing. We had a double (2 twin beds), and overall I would say the room was a bit small by US standards, but we stayed in other German hotels as well and this room wasn't any smaller than the other rooms we had encountered. The breakfast buffet was really good. Overall, I would stay there again for an overnighter, but it wouldn't be my choice for an extended stay in the city with my family.

<Content>Average hotel, sub-par room. Stayed here for one night in March 2006. Had booked the room through Orbitz. When I got there, was told at the front desk that no rooms were available. After some more checking, they put me into a room for people with disabilities. Room was adequate, but small, dark, and just didn't feel inviting. Breakfast buffet was ok. Had stayed at the nearby Bristol Hotel before, which was a much more pleasant experience. There's many hotels around there to choose from, and I won't be back at this.

<Content>Very helpful staff Just returned from Frankfurt, Intercity hotel.Literally across the road from the HauptBahnhof (Main Station) which is great if you intend to use the U Bahn to get around or if you are going to get out and about on the train. only problem with the location is, like London and other big cities, the main stations tend to attract some undesirables at the front entrance. In Frankfurt they have a group of drug dealers/users and Prostitutes. That being said, if you have to walk through them and you ignore them, they get on with what they are doing and don't seem to bother you. (or were we just lucky?) I would cut through the station via the side entrances to avoid the front if I were you. KaiserStrasse has a few sex shops on it also, which enevitably attracts groups of Men so if you don't like the seedier side of life I suggest you stick to the U Bahn to head for the Zeil and main sites instead of walking. The Hotel itself is fine for a short break or if you are on a short business trip. Clean, tidy small rooms with small ensuite. (small but still big enough) The staff could not be more helpful and all speak excellent English.Breakfast Buffet is the usual fayre but there is plenty of choice so there should be something for everyone. A typical City centre hotel really, not too many frills but exactly as described in reviews and brochures.

<Content>Nice hotel, well priced, excellent location The Intercity hotel is right next to the main train station, and short walk the centre of Frankfurt. The room was fairly small, but very nice, and surprisingly cheap. The hotel had an 'upmarket' air about it compared to similarly priced hotels we had stayed at in other European cities. Guests get a pass for the commuter trains, so you can walk across the road and catch a train to the international airport (about 25 minutes) free of charge. The staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English, even though I offered to speak to them in German. The only downside was the cost of breakfast, for two of us it would have added 50% to the cost of our room to have breakfast included. We bought a full cooked breakfast at Frankfurt International Airport, and it was cheaper than the breakfast buffet at the hotel would have been.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip, and thought it was great. It's extraordinarily convenient to the train station and quite close to the city center, too. The neighborhood was not a problem, despite the warnings from previous reviews. The rooms were not huge, but we didn't mind. Wireless is available in the lobby and some of the rooms, and the selection of TV channels was good. Even if you don't have the hotel breakfast, there are plenty of options close at hand within the station. All together, this hotel was a fantastic value for the (small) amount of money we paid, about 65 euros.

<Content>Inadequate Overpriced Rooms I reserved a double room and was given a small room with two small single beds (not big enough for an average size person) in a wing of the hotel that reminded me of construction trailer type accomodation. I was not happy considering that I was paying the equivalent of more than 100 USD/night . I travel through Europe once a month for my job and this type of overpriced accomodation is the norm there. I advise all Cdns and Americans to avoid vacationing in Europe unless they plan to spend megabucks and get ripped off, particularly now with the strong Euro

<Content>Great location, nice hotel Great location, right across the street from the train station -- perfect if you're in Frankfurt for a night to catch a plane from their busy airport. Rooms small but comfortable -- hallways just a bit worn. Friendly and helpful staff (except for unanswered request for extra pillow). Beds not great and pillows awful. Very good shower, and plenty of storage space. Would definitely stay here again for a single night.
