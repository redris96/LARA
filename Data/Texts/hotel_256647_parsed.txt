<Content>Terrible terrible terrible We stayed here because it is close to the airport. This is something that I regret.I booked and paid for a room with an airport view, so keep that in mind while I go on.It took us 20 minutes to check in because they lost our booking. We got no help with our luggage. We went up to the 7th floor and I opened the room. The first thing that hit me was that the room was already occupied by someone else! Luckily they were not in there but their personal possesions, phones, laptop and everything were out, all for me to take if i was like that! The room didnt even over look the airport!I hailed down a porter and told them who didnt seem interested and told us to go back down to reception. We were given another room and I asked if it overlooked the airport and the answer I received was yes. Well when we got to the room it didnt, so I was lied to.I went back down to reception. Waited again and expressed my displeaseure. I said that I booked a room with airport views, the first one i got was someone elses room with no airport view, the second was empty but with no view and was lied to that it did have one! He then said that he will move us to a delux suite.I then went back to level 7 to get my wife, then to level 12. Opened the room and hey presto, it had a view of the airport. I dont know about delux suite, it was exactly the same as the other two rooms but with an airport view.The service here is terrible. How can you give out someone elses room! Even thought its close to the airport i wouldnt stay here again.

<Content>Good if you need to be close to the airport We stayed one night in November so that we could be close to the airport for an early morning flight.The staff at reception are wonderful. Very helpful, professional and accomodating. The room itself was OK, no major complaints, but a standard hotel room with reasonably good quality fittings. For our purposes for one night it was completely fine.The food in the hotel is a bit substandard. The menu didn't offer a great variety of choices and it seems the preferred option is the buffet, but if you are pregnant (like myself) then buffets aren't great. The food was overly expensive for what it was and the service at the restaurant was a little below expectation - when travelling with a child and giving a childrens menu it usually helps to advise if any of the listed options are not available PRIOR to leaving the menu. Of course our 3 year old was set on having pizza only to be told that they couldn't do it. This is not a big issue in itself but anyone who knows what it's like to manage the expectations of a tired 3 year old will know what I'm talking about!!Anyway my only other complaint was that the sheets were so OVERLY starched that they made a huge noise every time we moved in bed. This probably sounds bizarre but I've never come across this before and I spent the whole night trying not to move so that I didn't wake up my husband or daughter!!We got an excellent deal for the room on Wotif.com so for what we paid it was perfect. The location next to the airport was great and within easy reach for the shuttle bus which took literally a few mintues to get to the airport. The noise from the train and the airport was actually very minimal and our 3 yr old was very entertained by watching the planes landing and taking off.All in all if you need to stay next the airport this is an excellent option, just don't eat at the hotel and make sure you shop around for the price!

<Content>Normal Airport Hotel OK if your staying overnight to catch a flight. For the price, you get an average room for this class. Front desk is helpful and business like. Fast transport to domestic and international terminals but $5 charge. We stayed in one of their upgrade rooms which included breakfast. By 8 am the buffet was cleaned out with several items missing, over 1/2 the tables in the dining room had yet to be bussed and the staff seemed to care less. There was also a charge for using one of their computers which could have been included in the higher upgrade room rate.Overall, it will do fine for just a night but have stayed at much better airport hotels.

<Content>An expensive way to suit our purposes We stayed here 1 night before heading off O/S. I choose the hotel for its location - the closest to the Domestic Terminal - and cause it looked the nicest place to stay in the area.The room was your average hotel room - a decent size, reasonable fittings and furniture. Huge marble bathroom. Usual array of toiletries. everything was usual.the hotel was having a Malaysian Food Festival and the buffet was all themed - so we had that dinner and really enjoyed it.The one problem with this place - everything is expensive. The room was expensive, the dinner buffet, pay for the internet, and we used the valet parking option and that was $15 - all for your usual business hotel. The room is mostly insulated from the noise of the airport and surrounding roads and the freight train line - mostly!

<Content>Good We stayed in this hotel prior to going overseas. We had a dbl dbl room which was nice. We ate at the restaurant and ordered from the menu, which was pricey but the quality of the food was fine and we didnt feel ripped off by what we got. I found the staff at reception very good. The concierge was only ordinary and he didnt seem to know the area around the hotel. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay again.

<Content>Great Location, just don't eat here If you need an overnight between internal or International flights this hotel is ideal. Great room, good rates, quiet, clean and convenient. A $5 transfer door to door from terminal to hotel runs every few minutes. BUT.. don't eat here or expect anything close to 'service'. We chose the buffet AUS$65 per head. It was dreadful, we complained that some dishes were not fresh, others were missing. The reply was uninterested and unwilling the compensate us. My advise is just to sleep here, don't eat.

<Content>Average We have stayed here many times before. But this time we were let down, mainly by the staff. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. However the concierge staff seemed to not understand English and were also very unhelpful in trying to get us to the airport via there $5 shuttle (it use to free) that was fully booked and then via a taxi. We also found the service in the restaurant quite slow and when ordering a $16 hamburger we were told that it was pre cooked and couldn't be cooked to our liking. I would try one of the other airport hotels before returning to this one. The staff seemed very un-motivated and un-helpful.

<Content>Good views The rooms were very comfortable. We booked two king rooms with views over sydney airport which was very nice. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. The rooms were very clean. The parking is a bit of a nightmare. If you want the hotel to park it for you its $15 each time you need to use the car. Otherwise its $10 per night. Even though we had one car each of us were charged for parking per day. This became very costly over a few days. We ordered room service which was fresh and came to the room fast. Make sure you find the card on the bedside table to use the 20% off each meal in the hotel if you dont get your room made up every night. We didnt notice it till it was too late. We had the seafood buffet. Although it was nice I dont think it was worth the money. The prawns were a bit slimey and the crab had no flavour. I strongly suspect that everything was not as fresh as it should have been. The smoked salmon and salads were delicious. There was great variety of desserts. We tried many of them however some were stale and not very nice to eat. The service here was not very good at all. Overall we did enjoy this trip but then when we reviewed the bill at home we found that we had been charged for mini bar items we did not consume. This left a bad feeling so I guess I would try somewhere else in the future.

<Content>Top Location and Hotel My husband and I stayed overnight prior to leaving Sydney and we enjoyed our stay at the Stamford Plaza. We booked online through 'need it now' and secured a lovely room for $170...a BARGAIN for Sydney. The room was clean, well presented, quiet, and offered good facilities for the money. The guests next-door were a little noisy but this didn't go on for long. We ordered room service dinner and the service and food were both EXCELLENT. Checking in and out was smooth, efficient and we received very good service from desk staff. I would happily stay here again and would/will recommend it to friends and family.

<Content>Lovely rooms - don't order the sundae! We stayed in a lovely room which we got for a great price on wotif. Very comfortable beds, lovely size bathroom and an aveda soap which I thought a nice touch for a chain airport hotel.Parking very easy to navigate and lots of it which is a plus at the airport.We had dinner at the hotel, decided against the buffet and had a nice a la carte meal. Food was good except for the ice cream sundae which was vastly different from the menu description - three scoops of neapolitan for $16!! As noted in other reviews, service left a lot to be desired in the restaurant.The other hotel staff were very nice. Would probably stay again if I got the same good deal.

<Content>Convenient, but 3-star quality at best The hotel is conveniently located. Just a couple of minutes drive from the domestic terminal. Less than 10mins from the international. Room size reasonable, comfortable and clean. Food selection and quality for breakfast is good. Service good.If you expect 4-5 star quality, you should go somewhere else. The hotel is ok - but everything about it, especially the bathroom, the lobby, the cafe, etc, shows it is ageing and seriously needs some upgrading done if it wants to advertise itself at least 4 stars. Unfortunately in the airport area, there are not many options. The $5 hotel transfer per way, although seems to be normal practice in Sydney, i think is ridiculous and should be part of the service.

<Content>Was fine, especially for an airport hotel We stayed at the Stamford Airport on 8/16. Our room was quiet, clean and the beds were comfortable. There was no airport noise. We used the gym and found that the outdoor pool was quite cool, but my child used it nevertheless. We ended up eating in the hotel restaurant because no other options existed. While the food was quite good, the service was slow and the servers seemed somewhat disinterested; the check was not accurate and it took some time for us to get the bill corrected. Beware of the hotel irons; I tried to iron a shirt and now have a dirty imprint on my shirt. We took the shuttle to the international terminal early in the morning and I can confirm the need to reserve space ahead of time. Overall, I would stay here again, but would not use the pool, irons and would order room service.

Room wasn't clean, service non existent bordering on don't care attitudes, I can honestly say that I have had better experiences in BBs. Dreadful, simply dreadful. Avoid - I'd suggest a tent if this was the only place left to stay in NSW!

<Content>Average Hotel, nothing special I recently stayed at the Stamford Plaza while passing through Sydney enroute to Canada. I was given a complimentary upgrade to a 'Deluxe' room at check in which was nice. The room was large and quite comfortable the only complaint I have is that if you look close enough, everything is very worn. The carpet, the furniture, the wallpaper etc all looked as though it has seen better days. Internet use in the room is going for $30AUD which is ridiculous and the shuttle to the airport costs $5AUD each way! And make sure you book a seat in advance...I was in the lobby shortly after 7am only to be told all the spaces in the tiny hotel van were already booked!

<Content>Excellent airport choice! Great property if you're after something close by to the airport.I've stayed here quite a few times now, and if you stay here on a Sunday/Monday night the prices are usually lower than mid-week...The $5 shuttle service works perfectly and the rooms are quiet and comfortable. The windows are double-glazed and there is no airport noise at all...The bar downstairs serves great coffee and snacks (and ice-cream!) and the last time I was here, they let my family park in their car park for a few hours free of charge so we could have a proper goodbye before I left to live overseas.If you can get it for the right price, this is an excellent airport hotel..

<Content>Paper thin walls stayed at the stamford on sat 19.4.08 after dropping brother at airport, reception was friendly enough but room seems dated even after reno's and beds are hard and pillows terrible. the worst thing was the noise from the adjoining room which started at 12 at night till at least 3am rang reception and asked if they could do something about it which involved knocking on the door and being told by guests next door to [--] off and then giving up, was offered another room but as my 1 year old daughter had just gone to sleep after 2 hours of being kept awake by the noise i couldn't see the point i asked again for them to do something about the noise and the rang them and no change, i rang again at 3 in the morning to be told there was nothing they could do about it and to see the duty manager in the morning.next morning at check out after no sleep i asked for the duty manager and told him my concerns, his reply was to offer free parking at a value of 10 dollars, i laughed as i thought he was joking after paying good money for no sleep he said the best he could offer was 2 free breakfast in there restaraunt which is about what soggy cold bacon and sloppy eggs are worth.for anyone wanting to stay at a decent hotel at the airport pick the holiday inn at least you might get a nights sleep.

<Content>Very good quality hotel First rate hotel, very close to airport; perfect for a one-night stay awaiting flight home. Large room with desk, sofa, king bed -- best bed of the 9 hotels I recently stayed at in AU. Excellent staff, very professional. There is nothing within walking distance worth checking out (e.g. bars or restaurants) so one is pretty much confined to premises. Also, there is a charge for the airport shuttle, which I thought was ludicrous. Internet was very expensive. With these exceptions, we were very pleased.

<Content>Once bitten twice shy!! Myself and my husband recently enjoyed a well earned one month holiday in Australia. The grand finale for our holiday was to spend a few days celebrating New Years Eve in Sydney. We decided to blow the budget and stay in a really nice 5 star hotel near the airport as we were leaving early on New Years Day. We opted to stay for two nights at the Stamford Plaza Hotel but we were bitterly disappointed with what we found. Upon arrival there was no porter to assist with luggage, reception staff were cold and unfriendly and uttered the minimal amount of words to us upon registration. We had to explore the hotel ourselves to find out where the pool, gym etc were. The bar staff were positively ignorant and unhelpful. It was almost like having customers was a total inconvenience. The bar area was filthy with layers of dust on every piece of dismal dark furniture. The restaurant was closed for some reason unknown to us, and as meals were now only being offered in the (unclean) bar area we had no choice but to eat elswhere. Internet facilities were a joke and printing was only available by sending an email to a Stamford Plaza email address with your print job attached. This was extremely frustrating and for a 5 star hotel ridiculous in the extreme. The outdoor pool had just 5 sun loungers available to hotel guests. I witnessed people lying on their towels on the hard tiled floor. This is hardly appropriate for again i reiterate a 5 star hotel. Our executive suite, which we payed an obscene amount of money for was adequate at best. Numerous pieces of furniture in the room were visibly damaged. The mini bar was not fully stocked or replenished for that matter. The thing that shocked me the most was the state of the bathrobes. One of ours was competely out of shape, had a badly torn pocket and one of the belt hooks was missing. The rightful place for this was in the bin, and it most definitely should not have been presented to paying guests. I will add that the bed was comfortable and that the bathroom was a great size with a large shower and separate bath. I would like to comment that the best service we got was from one of the concerige team who went out of his way to flag down a taxi for us on New Years Eve, unfortunately I did not get his name. Overall this hotel was a major disappointment and going forward I know to never ever consider booking a Stamford Plaza Hotel anywhere in the world again because like I say in the title of this review, Once bitten twice shy.

<Content>Closed out of the door! I have booked an overnight room before my trip back to Montreal from Sydney. I arrived in the afternoon and in the evening I had a business diner with a colleague of mine. Before going out, I paid the (very expensive) internet connection with the intention to work a bit on my return.When I was back, I was not able to open the door of my room. After several attempts by personnel of the reception, and at about 2 am, it was (quickly?) realized that the electronic lock of the door was broken and there was no way to get in. As my flight was at 9.30 am, I was given another room and the promise of being able to access my original room by 6.30 am. Of course, only when I woke up at 6.30 am my issue was resumed and I was able to get in the ancient room at about 7.45 am -after they broke down the door-, getting very late to catch my plane. The hotel agreed to provide me a taxi to the airport (which they did, i think they realized that loosing the flight back would have been unpardonable! ) and to waive my INTERNET which I hardly used (maybe 10 mins?). Needless to say they NEVER waived my Internet and they NEVER answered to my complains. This an expensive, 5 star hotel. Get to your own conclusions...

<Content>Comfortable overnight stay We stayed at the Stamford recently after arriving on a late night flight from overseas and found the hotel to be just what we needed for an overnight stay.There was a very long taxi queue outside the airport terminal, so we rang the hotel to be told that a complimentary hotel bus was available - what a relief. The staff at reception checked us in quickly and were welcoming and friendly,We had a deluxe room which was very comfortable and had all that we needed - lovely Aveda bathroom treats, good quality linen and very comfortable pillows. There was a coffee plunger and coffee grounds to make a proper cup of coffee. The room was a good size, well maintained and a pleasant decor.We found the breakfast to be well presented and a good selection.The taxi to the domestic airport was only $6 so cheaper than the hotel shuttle bus.

<Content>OK for overnight stay This hotel is very close to the airport but there is nothing located in its vicinity. Thus it is fine for an overnight before catching a flight but not for much else re its location. The rooms are a decent size clean comfortable and well equipped. Service is fine with clean and fine lobby. The bar area is smallish but comfortable and the restaurant is fine with a good buffet. Expensive for what you get but recommended for pre flight stop.

<Content>Not the Best My husband and I and our 6 month old daughter stayed here for 3 nights in August. My husband had to attend a work conference nearby as soon as we arrived which is the only reason we chose to stay here. We had arranged for a cot for our baby several weeks earlier however when we arrived there wasnt one set up in the room. I tried to phone the reception desk however the phone wasnt working. I had to carry a screaming overtired baby down to reception to enquire about the cot and the phone. 5 and a half hours and 2 more trips down to reception later our cot finally arrived. The phone was not fixed until the next day but it was an inconvenience as I wanted to order room service as I didnt feel comfortable eating in the hotels restaurant with my daughter. The bed felt like it was sinking, the remote for the tv wasnt working properly and I felt the service was lacking. However, it was clean and quiet and I would consider staying here again.

<Content>a very pleasant stopover at the Stamford Plaza Booked a superior room special package from the website well in advance as a stopover in Sydney after returning from a 6 weeks trip to Europe, prior to returning to our home on the Gold Coast the next day.It was an opportunity to catch up with one of our daughters and her husband, who live in Sydney, and tell them about our wonderful trip.We were upgraded to a deluxe room on the top floors which was very spacious and well presented. It looks like this one had been renovated.Well, we were more interested in conversation than the room, however we did notice some unusual noise coming from a nearby room for a short while.We had a great nights sleep in a very comfortable bed, but unfortunately we were woken at 6am by the same noise we had heard the night before. Never mind, we looked out the window and watched the air traffic at Sydney airport with all sorts of jets taking off and landing. Its a wonderful view from this vantage point, so close to the airport, but without the noise.The shower was absolute bliss and a welcome back to Australia, following our most recent stay in an apartment in Rome with pathetic water pressure.Breakfast was a typical Aussie fare and we particularly enjoyed having some real bacon with the fillet attached, not like europe where you only get the scrappy tail bit!We scanned the breakfast room to try to identify if there were any honeymooners in the room, but agreed that perhaps it was too much to expect that they would surface for breakfast.We had read the several ordinary reviews of this hotel on TA before we booked and realised that the best chance of a comfortable room was to book a renovated Superior room. To be upgraded to a Deluxe room was a bonus. An airport hotel was a convenient option for us and we are glad that we chose the Stamford Plaza.By the way, every interaction with staff was very friendly, courteous and polite, just what you expect.This is the first time that we have stayed in an airport hotel and we were surprisingly more than happy with the experience. The unhappy reviewers on this site must be a stressfull and grumpy old lot!

<Content>Only stay here out of desperation Stamford Plaza Airport Hotel Sydney: Stayed for 1 night `9th July 2007. Pre paid for a deluxe room on the top 2 floors of this supposedly 鈥榳ith refurbished rooms鈥? Ours did not appear to us to have been done, if it had, it was not apparent. The rooms are not deluxe at all, no trouser press, no goodies, just a plain basic hotel room. Not what you would call a 5 star deluxe hotel of the quality of any Asian stop-over hotel nor of European deluxe standards.Upon check-in they said the room was not pre-paid, it took me, not the hotel some 3 hours of telephoning around the globe before at 11pm, some 6 hours after check-in for the hotel to acknowledge the room was paid in full. There was neither a reservation manager on duty nor a front desk manager just an assistant night manager on duty from 5pm. He was also the hotels night manager, who just hadn鈥檛 got a clue how to sort my problem out, as I was leaving on a 6am flight he said the reservation will resolve this after 9am tomorrow when they come in. For a supposedly 5 start hotel this hotel is very badly run from a gusts point of view.Our mini bar had nine (9) items missing upon check-in; it took them 2 hours to send someone to the room to fill it. They then said it was the past guest fault as they must have stolen the items after check-out. Be warned this is a very badly managed establishment.They only have one restaurant, which is next to then main entrance foyer and on a cold night the wind and draft from the main hotel entrance opening and closing made it a very chilly meal indeed. The food was deplorable; the selection on the menu was not of a deluxe standard hotel. One could say very 2 star food menu. The staff were almost all trainees and work experience, only one experience waiter on duty to serve a full airport hotel restaurant on its main evening shift. They were unable to cope and it showed in all of the food quality and service. They ended up giving us a bottle of wine as the soup served was in fact, coloured water. They all agreed that it was not soup and how it was served they have no idea, the steak was so tough that you had to slice it very thinly to even be able to chew it. With no management on duty to complain to, no wonder this hotel has such bad service, they don鈥檛 care about guests here, as it鈥檚 on the airport. I suppose they have the attitude that because of so many delayed flights they will always be able to fill their rooms.Don鈥檛 book this hotel for a luxury stay or a quality meal, book this out of desperation only, there are many good hotels in Sydney to choose from, don鈥檛 choose this Stamford Plaza Airport Hotel.

<Content>Felt ripped off Chose this hotel for its spa, sauna and pool facilities. The spa was tepid, the sauna not turned on. When we told the manager he was not apologetic at all. Said we should have called reception. We said there wouldn't have been time to get the heat up, he said their engineers could override the settings. Wow, engineers that have the power to override the laws of physics, Fab.Free shuttle to hotel but $5 per person back to airport!!!Rooms were very clean, and the 2 people who checked us in and out were lovely. Noone helped us with our luggage though, wondered if it was because we were in jeans and t shirts.We would not stay here again, there are other places at better value.

<Content>Good value hotel We spent 2 nights here in Jan07 as unable to get city accommodation for a reasonable rate. It cost AUD140 a night and we got spacious, spotlessly clean rooms with very friendly and helpful service. The views over the airport are great and importantly, the rooms are brilliantly soundproofed so you'd never know you were right beside a busy airport. We didn't eat at the hotel as it seemed expensive but found a great little place only steps away called Patchetts Pies. They did a great breakfast and naturally a huge array of pies which were handy for picnic lunches. The train station was about 8 mins walk away in the domestic terminal or a farther walk to Mascot (15 mins and cheaper fares!) for a frequent service into the city. Trains were cheap AUD11 return or about AUD29 for a daytripper fare which included ferries, buses etc. We spent all day in town and ate there in the evening so really only used the room for sleeping. Obviously a city centre hotel is more convenient but as we found out when we moved into the city centre, hotels there are very expensive, rooms are smaller and it was very noisy. I'd reccommend this hotel as a good place to stay for a night or two until you get your bearings or longer if you don't mind using public transport to get to the centre.

<Content>OK for a night before or after a flight Stamford is better quality hotel for being a 'near airport' accommodation. We have stayed there a number of times before flights. This time we traveled with our adult children and required 2 rooms. Both had terribly stained carpets. We all had the $48 seafood buffet for tea on our first night which was a reasonable meal, however, when the waiter pulled out our chairs mine was so stained it should have been thrown out. I know I would stay there again but am getting disappointed by the demise of it's quality. Is it also true that the better the hotel the less friendly the staff are?????

<Content>Ok for by the airport I booked my first night in Sydney at this hotel. It is nothing special but is reasonable if you need to be near the airport or don't want to go into the city your first night. I wouldn't book an entire vacation here or anything. The property is definitely dated and is undergoing some renovation in the lobby. The rooms definitely had some wear on the carpets and around the edges, but the bathroom and bed were both fine. I arrived early and was allowed to use the hospitality lounge before the room was free. However it didn't seem like many people use the lounge as there was no soap available and just one towel. Another drawback is that the deli next door is only open during the week for the business workers, so there are not many food options except for the on site restaurants which are rather expensive.

<Content>stay here all the time I stay at this hotel for business about 4-6 times a year and have never had a bad experience. The cleanliness and facilities are excellent, close proximity to sydney airport without the noise, and good food. I have stayed at all the other sydney airport hotels (mercure, holiday inn etc) and this is by the far the best. Consistently good.

<Content>Great rooms with awesome views Stayed one night and rooms were way better than expected. Had a superior room on the 10th floor, overlooking the airport - AWESOME views of both runways. Bed is fantastic, room was sparkling clean and couldn't hear any noise. It only cost $7 to get a cab becuase i didn't want to wait for the shuttle bus - so it's pretty cheap. The lobby and bar downstairs (Including the 'AV8' pub) aren't anthing spectacular, but it is an airport hotel. Still, you get very good service everywhere.Will definately stay here again - beds + bathroom are firstclass

<Content>4.5 stars? I think NOT Rooms are old and dated and need updating. Do NOT expect service. It does not happen. We stayed for a night and ate in the restaurant. We both ended up sick. Give the Sea Food buffet a BIG miss. I'll go back to staying at Holiday Inn. Its the same standard and less expensive.None of the Airport Hotels in Sydney are great at all.best off taking a cab to Newtown for something to eat

<Content>Dreadful stay I travel frequently with work and stayed in this hotel due to a short trip in and out of Sydney. Having heard that the hotel was 5 stars (WHO gave it 5 stars...???!) I was horrified by the whole experience:* no mention of shuttle service when reservation was made, leading to payment for taxi fare from airport* unfriendly and unhelpful reception service on check in* room cleanliness appalling - black marks all over carpet, paintwork shabby* pillow cases had black marks on them* non-existent mini bar (fridge completely empty)* a previously-used breakfast ordering brochure that therefore could not be used by anyone elseJust awful - don't stay there if you can avoid it.

<Content>OK, But Nothing Special My partner  I decided to stay at the Stamford as we were only in Sydney for a one day stopover  it had a 5 star rating. Who gives these ratings? First problem occured when we waited over 1/2 hour for a shuttle bus that never turned up. We ended up catching a taxi  when we arrived at the hotel, almost 45 minutes after leaving the Arrivals hall, the shuttle bus was sitting in the driveway! Check in was fast  friendly  while the room was ok, it was nothing special. It looked old, the bathroom was small  dated,  there was only one chair at the 'dining' table (a problem we've encountered at numerous hotels). Our first night was fine - the bed was really comfortable, the air conditioning worked well  their was no noise from the airport at all. The view was pretty poor - an empty block of land with a couple of pools of water. The gym was great, one of the best hotel gyms we've seen  the pool was basic but clean.Breakfast was great  the staff were friendly  attentive. We went out for the day  came back to find that housekeeping had removed all our soap  they had not replaced the milk that we had used. A call to housekeeping soon had this fixed, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place. The worst experience was when we ordered supper - toast  hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was barely warm  we were given no plates to eat our toast from. The toast was wrapped in a napkin, but no plates!This hotel is ok to catch up on sleep between flights, but I certainly wouldn't rate it 5 star. It is value for money overall though, when compared to other Sydney hotels.

<Content>Terrible Experience Room very dirty - carpet had dark black lines around the edge where it had been cleaned so many times. Way overdue for a refurb. Asked to change rooms but was put in another room which was almost identical. By this time it was 9pm so too late to move. This hotel should not talk it's self up as a five star - in it's current condition it's barely a two star. Choose the Mercure at the Airport instead.
