<Content>Lovely spot in Ubud We stayed here over the holidays and I must say we really enjoyed it. This lovely property is set in the middle of tranquil rice paddies with only the sounds of nature (frogs and insects) to lull you at night. The small size of the property (16-17 rooms I think) serves only to add character and intimacy to it. I wouldn鈥檛 trade it for the fancy-swanky chains dotting Bali especially the ones with all the tour groups. The rooms (we stayed in both deluxe and superior) were clean (turn down service 2x daily) and comfortable (cold a/c). The only difference really was the size. Location although not in the main drag is actually close if one uses the Monkey Forest cut-through and not a problem since a shuttle was available very hour. My kudos goes to their staff for being polite, warm and accommodating.A few minor things though could stand a little tweaking. A shower curtain should actually delineate a shower area and not be used as a window covering. In both rooms we stayed in, the floor always gets wet because of this. The rooms could also use more wall outlets. Between me and boyfriend鈥檚 iPods and cameras, we needed at least 3 free outlets. We ended up taking turns charging our devices. Also, breakfast could stand to have more choices (cereal  whole grain bread please) and the coffee was weak and watery, such a shame considering Indonesia is known for its good coffee. Overall, even with the minor things, our stay was quite pleasant. For the price point, I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to stay at this place again and definitely recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Wonderful stay We stayed here for three nights in early November this year and had a really wonderful and relaxing stay. The room was perfect and the staff went out of their way to be helpful, helping us to book activities and organise transportation for the later stages of our trip. The setting of the hotel is great, right next to the Monkey Forest with just a short stroll into town and the shuttle service operated by the hotel which came in very useful for us when it was raining hard! I would recommend this place highly.

<Content>Great service and beautiful setting We booked this hotel based on the excellent reviews for Saren Indah. We were looking for a comfortable, relaxing place to stay in Ubud and we weren't disappointed.We stayed 3 nights in October '08 and loved everything about the place. The hotel was beautiful, laid out in stunning gardens with a Japanese pond, swimming pool, and exotic flowers. The location was ideal, despite the walk past the monkey forest, as it was only 15 minutes walk into the main centre. As well as being super friendly and courteous the staff went out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable in your room - there were so many nice touches, from the twice-daily housekeeping, to afternoon tea on your balcony at 3pm, to fresh towels at the swimming pool folded on the chairs with flowers placed on them. Every morning there was a delicious breakfast laid out in the garden restaurant, although we only took advantage of this on one day as the other two days we left too early for breakfast. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff - they were happy to organise tours and to pick us up from the hotel, a taxi to the airport, and a free shuttle to and from town. This was very handy in the evening as the route past the monkey forest is pitch black at night, so you don't feel very safe walking along there. We had a room on the ground floor with our own veranda facing the paddie fields. The accommodation was beautiful and really clean and much care was taken to maintain this during our stay. At night the bed would be turned down with the mosquito net untied to hang around the bed. The frog chorus in the evening was not quiet, but added to the special atmosphere of the place. We were there in mid-season, but we were lucky to find availability two days before arriving; we were talking to another couple who were only able to stay for two nights as the hotel was full, so they stayed in an almost identical hotel next door, which they said was empty in comparison. I would recommend the Saren Indah Hotel to anyone who appreciates peaceful surroundings, service with a smile (and a bow) and immaculate and spacious rooms.

<Content>A bit of paradise Recently we stayed in this hotel for five days. At all times the staff were courteous, friendly and efficient; smiles, smiles and more smiles. The room was spotlessly clean and bathroom linen was changed twice daily. Any request was dealt with promptly including regular top ups of hot water for our cups of tea!! The view over paddy fields and the nightly sound of frogs was wonderful. The dining area was in a delightful setting and the staff were quietly efficient - the meals were good and we particularly enjoyed each breakfast. The grounds and the pool were kept immaculate. Although the hotel was within easy walking distance through the monkey forest to the town centre the shuttle service offered was a bonus. We were made to feel part of a warm and caring family It was such a wonderful experience we will be returning in 2009.Barb and Max DaisleyPerthWestern Australia

<Content>Nice, quiet, very friendly and helpful staff Stayed in Saren Indah (deluxe room) for 3 nights. Everything was great. Deluxe rooms are all upstairs and you can see over the rice field which is quite nice. But, rooms downstairs looked good with nice garden in front. The room was very clean everyday. The bathroom was also very nice. Staff were always very helpful and responded quickly. It's right next to Monkey Forest Sactuary and you can go through the monky forest to get to Ubud central. It takes about 5 min to get to Ubud on foot, then it takes another 5-10 min to get to the central. We walked through the monkey forest everyday even at night, but, if you don't like walking, the hotel provides free transport to Ubud wherever you want any time on your request. Only one thing was the sound proof between downstairs and upstairs. You can sort of hear even people downstairs conversation etc. Also it would be very good if there is some kind of blind outside balcony area between buidings for privacy because the room where we stayed, our balcony was totally open to the balcony in the next building. Luckily, next door people and us never sat in the balconys at the same time...But, those are only minor things. The hotel was exellent for value . Definitely will return if we are going back to Bali!

<Content>Fantastic Value for Money Whilst many hotels in Ubud gather dust and still push their prices up, Saren Indah focuses on their service, cleanliness and maintenance better than most whilst still charging a comparatively low $37 per night. It has the homestay price and atmosphere whilst the service is on a par with the big guns. Clean, extremely helpful and very friendly, if you have a tight budget but still want hotel treatment, this is the place for you in Ubud.

Staying at this hotel made our stay in Bali even more relaxing and memorable.

<Content>An Oasis of calm and serenity Ahhh the Saren Indah. What a beautiful place. I booked a package with them for $60 per night for a room with A/C, minibar, TV. The room was spotlessly clean, I mean the cleanest room Ive ever stayed in. We had a four poster bed with mossy netting (not that there were any mossys). The bathroom tub was luxurious. Our deck was supplied with tea every morning. We slept to the sounds of frogs croaking and awoke to ducks quacking. Not in a noisy way, but in a natural peaceful way. Breakfast was excellent, the pool nice, The staff so helpful and smiling. It was a 10-15 minute walk through the monkey forest to Ubud center. Some might be annoyed by that, but the forest is cool, and we enjoyed each walk through there. It is close to everything, yet away from the beeping motorbikes. Loved it.

<Content>LOVED IT!!! This hotel was extremely pleasant and was a highlight of our trip. The facilities were very clean, and the staff was the most friendly I came across in all of Bali. They would come in and make up the room twice a day during our stay. The breakfast was a nice amenity. The pool is gorgeous. All rooms have AC and TV, which it doesn't say on their website but good to know, since the only difference between a superior and standard is the room size. So get the standard, since it is cheaper with pretty much the same amenities (including a refrigerator). They were very helpful in helping us rent a car and arrange for activities. Fantastic hotel.

<Content>Great hotel This hotel has a great location just a few minutes walk from town through the monkey forest, and is really lovely. The staff were great, the room was clean and more than adequate at the price, nice pool ,nice breakfast in a beautiful setting. It has the trappings of a more expensive hotel, and our basic room was fine. You will enjoy a stay here, so book early. It was booked out for the summer.

<Content>home sweet bali home My friend and I just finished a long stay here and were super pleased! The room we stayed in was charming and impeccably clean, the hotel grounds lovely - pool and all, and the location far enough away from the crowds and noise of the city center (a big plus in my opinion) but close enough to get there quickly (a free hotel shuttle takes you there in 5 minutes, or do the walk in 10 minutes). We could hear the melodies of crickets, frogs, and birds while looking at the lovely surrounding green fields from our room's front porch. Most noteworthy of the experience was our hotel family - the front desk staff and owner who took really good care of us and any request we had, big or small. Overall, a really good value. I'd definitely stay here again, and already miss it...

<Content>beautiful little hotel I stayed here for 3 night with my mother and two sisters, we had 2 deluxe rooms at the end of the property, we organised to be picked up from the airport by the hotel and even though our plane was about 3 hours late and arrived very early in the morning, about 2am, the driver was there with his little sign and a big smile waiting for us.This hotel is every thing it portrays on it's web site, it is surrounded on three sides by lush gardens and rice fields, we stayed in room 109, and I would say it had the best out look as it was rights at the end of the property and had views from the front and the side, we could even see mount Agung early in the morning. All rooms have lovely garden views, but I think the upstairs rooms are worth the extra for the view of the rice fields. This was one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in, I felt terrible when I opened a bottle of coke and it sprayed up the wall and onto the floor so I quickly got a wet wipes and cleaned it up, I did not get one single peace of dirt or dust on my wipes I could not believe how clean it was.Breakfast was basic with quite a limited choice but it was nice enough, the pool is beautiful and had plenty of sun or shade, we ordered lunch around the pool one day and it was lovely. Some of the staff had limited English, but it wasn't a problem as they were very eager to help.We had a monkey visit one morning, he jumped onto the balcony and just wandered along, up and down stairs saying hello to every one!It is only a five minute walk from here to the bottom of Monkey Forest road and you can skirt around the forest if you follow the signs to Ubud, so if the monkeys worry you it's really not a problem , we did this twice and only saw one monkey, also you don't have to pay to go through the forest if you go this way.I didn't have any complaints during our stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a real taste of Bali, surrounded by tranquility,.

<Content>A marriage made in heaven - of value and quality Initially, we tried to book another location. This was our 3rd choice, but should have been our 1st. We can't speak highly enough about the quality of the hotel and the staff. No platitudes - caring, passionate, professional people who made our stay special. This place is going places. we checked out better places but none BETTER. Take you anyhere anytime, help with anything. And under the drive of the youthful manager, watch this space.

<Content>an oasis in an oasis If you are planning to stay in Ubud while in Bali, and I urge that you do, the Saren Indah Hotel is a wonderful spot from which to base your explorations. Ubud and the surrounding villages offer a rich and genuine experience of Balinese culture and beauty. Saren Indah allows you to relax into the quiet side of Ubud life. The lovely hotel is immaculate and comfortable and set amid the vivid and varied greenery of rice fields, flowers and the adjacent sacred monkey forest, which you can stroll through or around en route to the action of town.Bali is an outdoor lifestyle and the hotel reflects this with pretty grounds and pool and a delicious open air breakfast amongst birdsong and very friendly staff.Moreover, the management and staff go out of their way to assist in all of your travel plans and needs. They helped me plan and negotiate excursions to others parts of Bali and to procure accommodation at the beach. True Balinese kindness and hospitality!

<Content>5 minutes walk, through the beautiful monkey forest, from Ubud centre I stayed here fore one week. It's located on the other side from monkey forest. In the morning it is al lovely walk through the forest to the city centre (takes about 5 minutes) If you want to go get something to eat in one of Ubud's many restaurants the hotel provides a free shuttle service with brings you to Ubud and picks you up when your finished. Great service because you do not want to walk through the forest when it is dark (you might step on a monkey...) Good basic rooms, I stayed on the top floor of one of the 4 bungalows and had a beautiful view over the surrounding rice fields. Breakfast was basic with frute and pancakes, good but after one week a bit boring.
