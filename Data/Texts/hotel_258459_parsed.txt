<Content>Character  A small, historic and charming hotel with friendly staff and which is perfectly situated in the heart of The Rocks, a stone's throw from the Sidney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and some great pubs and restaurants.Don't stay here if you're looking for a big, corporate chain hotel. Yes, you will have to climb the stairs to the reception carrying your own bags as there are no lifts, but for me that just adds to the attraction of the place.And they don鈥檛 charge for you to use the wireless internet, which is a refreshing change from most other hotels I鈥檝e stayed in.The rooms are decorated with old world charm and whilst there maybe the odd cracked tile, patches of scuffed wallpaper and creaky floorboard it doesn鈥檛 give the impression of neglect, just a lived in feeling.The hotel has a roof terrace and a comfortable lounge inside with a well stocked reading library.All in all, we felt entirely at home in the Russell.

<Content>Not for us We have learned a sharp lesson about 'boutique hotels' in Sydney. It means old fashioned, not particularly clean, very jaded, and very poor facilities.We had booked in here for a few nights, arriving at 7.00am early morning we did not expect access to our room but at least somewhere where we could freshen up. We were told to use one of the communal bathrooms but had to wait for an hour for other residents to use it. When we eventually got in there we found broken taps and the whole room was awful.I had lugged our cases up a rickety staircase barely wide enough for a case and in full view of people eating in the snack room. I was absolutely knackered. We were told to leave the cases by the desk but there was no real welcoming for us.My wife managed to get a peep into one of the rooms and then declared that under no circumstances would she stay there.It cost us the deposit but what a relief, except for the fact that I had to get the cases down those stairs again.We managed to find accommodation at the Old Sydney Post House and that was superb.There is such a great extreme between good and poor hotels in Sydney, our advice is go for the best you can afford otherwise your hard-earned holiday will be spoiled.

<Content>Great location, clean and friendly Brilliant location in The Rocks, you literally cross the street and go down a flight of steps and you are staring at the Opera House and the Bridge. Lots of places to eat and drink without having to venture far. I loved the charm and character of this old building, even the narrow winding stairs! Small double room that had everything I needed - the shared bathroom was a couple of metres down the hallway and was big, clean and private. Nice roof garden for relaxing with a drink. Staff are friendly and helpful but not intrusive, just how I like them! I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you have a very short time in Sydney and want to see the major tourist attractions in a short space of time (I only had a one night stop-over).

<Content>Comfortable, great location We have just returned from Sydney and spent four nights there, split between the beginning and end of our trip. I chose the Russell for its great location in the Rocks district, close to Circular Quay and the Harbor Bridge. Since my husband and I traveled with our 13 year old daughter, we got the suite, which is comprised of two bedrooms connected with a hallway and bathroom. This is a historic hotel without an elevator. Some may find this difficult, but the place is charming if you can see past the initial stairs. The beds were comfortable, the bathtub deluxe and the chocolates on the pillow were always welcome. Just the fact that we could walk out the front door of the hotel and walk all over Sydney was just our style. Or - the ferry and the train are about a block away so public transportation was easy. However, we rarely strayed far -- the restaurants, the bridge, the botanical gardens and the opera house were all an easy walk away. We really liked this place.

<Content>Don't stay here! We wish we had read the TripAdvisor 11/16/07 (San Francisco, CA) review prior to making our reservation--it mirrors our experience. We appreciate historic properties. The Russell, however, is just old, musty and lacks charm. Further, the hosts were quite rude. There is no elevator/lift and the only access is via a narrow (read one-way) staircase consisting of 24 steps with a turn. Carrying your luggage up the stairs is not an easy feat . When we balked at carrying our luggage up the stairs, the manager reluctantly found a staff person to do so and acted very put out. We booked our reservation based on Frommer's notation that The Russell was a find. It is not! It was overpriced ( especially when compared to the ambience and amenities offered by other hotels in the Rocks area ) and grossly overpriced compared to other hotels in Sydney. We left after the first night. It was not a pleasant experience and, thankfully, was the only such encounter during our three-week stay in Australia. Spare yourself the hassle and inconvenience that we experienced and find another hotel.

<Content>Great Location and Service The Russell has the perfect location. It's a small, quirky boutique hotel directly across the street from the Circular Quay. This was our first trip to Sydney and we were thankful to be so close to the typical touristy action. Upon arrival, we were a bit confused where to check in (past the restaurant and up the stairs), but once we arrived, we were greeted warmly and allowed to check in early (we were so thankful). The staff was all tremendously helpful and friendly. They insisted on carrying our bags up for us, even though we said we could manage. The stairs are a bit narrow and I don't recommend this hotel for someone who may have difficulty with steps. The building itself is dated, but absolutely as clean as they can get it to be. Our room was the standard room with shared bath for $145 AUD. If you want to be pampered, DO NOT book this room. It is very small, with no TV or AC. We found it to be comfortable though and the shared bath was never a problem. The breakfast was adequate for me, but my husband usually felt a little hungry after finishing. A laptop was provided during business hours for your convenience, however we brought our own and the hotel just provided us with a wireless key. The connection in the room was sketchy (as it was not intended to reach that far), but the lobby area is no problem. I loved the small touches that the hotel provided. The sitting room was great with loads of books about Australia and other things. I would recommend the hotel if you can accept the quirkiness that comes with it.

<Content>Such great potential... I stayed here Feb-2008 for 2 days. It cost $240 a night but with the extra charge for paying with Amex - it cost an extra $20 a night. However the staff did warn about that on day 1 - so if I wanted to I could have paid with cash to avoid it, however I didn't have $500 spare cash.None of the taxi drivers knew where the hotel was. I would suggest saying to them it's just past the Four Seasons because they all know where that is.What struck me immediately was what an enormous shame that they didn't use the restaurant. It's on the ground floor - with passing trade from the street - they would make a fortune on it!This is not a place for unwell, unfit or disabled people. The stairs up to reception are rather steep  quite narrow. I found it a little bit hard to get my small suitcase up it. Then once you check in - there's another long stairway. For me this was not a problem because I'm young and reasonably fit.My room was #14 (en-suite), which is as far away from the stairs/corridors as you can get. The window faces the police station next door. It was a good sized room, had TV, hair-dryer, iron/ironing board, kettle.The room itself is in need of some TLC. You could tell the staff did everything they could to get the room as spotless as humanly possible. However you could see the paint buckling  looking faded  the absence of a fan in the bathroom had caused mould in the past (however the staff scrubbed it with bleach every day so it wasn't actually any mould there anymore). The bed was comfy  clean. The touch of chocks on the pillow every day was sweet.I couldn't get the A/C to work (I could get it to turn on but it just wouldn鈥檛 go cold), but there was a ceiling fan to take the worst of the heat. The location is superb, lots of pubs, restaurants, the harbour bridge, opera house all within a very short walk.However the 2 reasons I probably wouldn't stay there again is that I think it was quite a bit to pay $240 a night but the real killer was the doors. Each door is pulled shut to lock (ie there is no handle to do this without noise). On the second night, the people in the room opposite me had no respect. Every time they left the room they would slam it shut. It was as loud as if it been my own door. At 2am one of them went to the toilet (that room is shared bath) and again slammed the door hard enough to wake me up. Now imagine a pair of party people staying next door = no sleep at all. I can only imagine how noisy it would be to stay in one of the rooms of the main corridor.This place could be such a winner if it was just fixed up a bit.

<Content>What a great hotel! What a great hotel! We stayed at the Russell during mid December for two nights. It was my first time in Sydney and it was a great place to crash. I don't like the big chain hotels so I picked one with a bit of character and this hotel definitely has that! It is just across the street from Circular Quay, located near lots of bars and restaurants. The roof terrace was a lovely touch as we came back from a long day of sightseeing to sit with a bottle of wine outside. The breakfast was perfect for us to and the free half hour internet was very useful.The only downside was that on a Saturday night there was a bit of noise from the bars below. We also opted for one of the cheaper rooms which also meant that it was a little small, with a view of a wall and we had a shared bathroom 鈥?but as we were out most of the time this didn鈥檛 bother us too much.It is clean, the staff are friendly, there are tea and coffee making facilities and to stay so close to the opera house and quick subway links around the city for this price was ideal! I would definitely go back!

<Content>Great location, shame about the noise Very well located just behind the Art Museum and in sight of the harbour bridge. Welcome was fine, though no restaurant on site was contrary to expectations form an earlier website. This was a problem with an evening arrival and a hungry child. Room was fine and large enough and had a spare bed in for my daughter. However their larger rooms all overlook George Street which gets very noisy at times. In the warmer months with the need for open windows this is a problem for sleeping.Breakfasts good enough for our needs, reception staff helpful and short free periods on a connected laptop were a bonus. In room proper tea as well as ground coffee were nice touches.

<Content>Don't stay at the Russell Hotel I cannot recommend this hotel. It happens to be the ONLY place in all of Australia where we encountered rudeness. The place is overpriced compared to all the other places we stayed during our travels in Australia. It is overpriced for the type of accommodations offered. There is no elevator, only a narrow stairway, up which we had to carry our own bags, no help was offered. The room was sort of moldy, depression era chic (not Laura Ashely chic as stated in the Moon Guide book) complete with peeling paint, no internet and lots of street noise. Not every employee was rude of course, but it really only takes one to make an impression. I would say this hotel is badly managed and overrated. We left in the middle of our planned stay and moved to a wonderful hotel a block away, very clean, very polite, with a beautiful view of Sydney Harbor and the Opera House, FOR THE SAME PRICE. What a relief.

<Content>Russell will Rock your Socks! What a great hotel! Charming and historic, a hotel with alot of character and warmth! The location cannot be beat. You're a two minute walk from the the harbor, the Circular Quay and a breathtaking view of the Harbor Bridge AND the Opera House. The best part about staying at this hotel was the neighborhood, a maze of cobblestone streets and charming restaurants and shops. That being said, it is located on George St. which is lined with a few pubs, restaurants and shops. During our stay on a Monday and Tuesday night we noticed more of a afterwork crowd, not a drunk people spilling onto the streets scene. Our room was not on the street but on a side street and only one night we heard some pub crawlers boisterously making their way back home at 2 am but it was brief and we chuckled thinking how our pub crawl lasted only two pubs and we were in bed by ten!Other reviewers have greatly over exxagerated all those stairs it's one stairway up and they will help you with your bags(we travel light but we saw the staff helping other people up with thier overstuffed suitcases). Advice to travelers in general is DON'T PACK SO MUCH!Speaking of the staff, they were awesome! Our flight arrived early in the morning. We got to the hotel at 9am and our room was ready to go even though check in is not until 3pm. We were so grateful to come to our cozy room and catch some zzz's after our long flight from California. Our room, though small, had everything you would need: Bathrobes, a coffee press, iron and ironing board, hairdryer, etc. The decor was lovely, the armoir beautiful and all the drawers in the dresser worked(functional and appealing).There were two bathrooms down the hall. One was spacious and pristine with lotion, and shampoo, and body wash. The other was very small; a wash closet on one side to shower and across from it was the toilet seperate but I never had to use this one. The spacious and spotless bathroom down the hall was always available.In the lobby there's a computer available to go on online and the staff was always helpful pointing us in the right direction of a caesar salad that I was craving. However, there's SO many eating options you can't go wrong. The breakfast downstairs was wonderful! You could get a full hot breakfeast with eggs, bacon and toast in addition to cereal, fruit, pastries, juices, coffee, tea... the works! We would fill up on breaky in the beautiful restaurant/breakfast room downstairs and be fueled up for a day of sight seeing. We had such great experience! We would not hesitate to return. We paid $110 a night for a double room. I believe we stayed in the cheapest and smallest room available AND I think we may have paid considerably less considering we got the rooom through a hotel broker at NeedItNow(the australian equivalent of orbitz). However, barring a budget I would come back here in a heartbeat. Enjoy!

<Content>A lovely alternative to Sydney's business hotels We loved our stay in this hotel. The room was large (we weren't in the cheapest but didn't have an en suite bathroom). The two shared bathrooms across the corridor were only shared with one or two other rooms. They were large and always clean, with a fantastic shower.The details were lovely: chocolates on the bed, Molton Brown shampoo etc.The decor was a bit 'shabby chic' but I found that a welcome change from sterile business hotels. Some of the antique pieces of furniture were beautiful. But I suppose this is a matter of taste - I can image some would prefer something more contemporary.The faciltiies were good - a terrace, a large living room with plenty of books (which would be especially good if you only had a small room), free internet in the lobby. Service was fine, though not obsequious. They offered to carry the bags up the stairs.Breakfast was excellent.Location - superb; need say no more.I'm not an AC sort of person so didn't miss this - there was a ceiling fan - but I would image this might cause issues for those used to AC. The road noise is also a draw back. There was a second double glazing we could have put on that almost eliminated it, but then the windows could not open. In the event we slept through fine, but those not used to traffic noise might not.

<Content>Boutique Hotel for Budget Traveler After researching and deciding on what we wanted to do in Sydney, we knew that we wanted to stay in The Rocks. After looking at hotel prices, we were beginning think that we wouldn鈥檛 be able to afford that. We stumbled on The Russell at another travel website, then went directly to The Russell鈥檚 website. Based on our travel style (caviar dreams on a tuna budget), here鈥檚 what we thought鈥?br/>The GoodEXCELLENT location. It鈥檚 directly across the street from the Circular Quay, which is the hub for all water transportation in Sydney Harbour, as well as the train system. Walk a little farther, and you鈥檙e at either the Harbour Bridge or the Sydney Opera House. Perfect!Some staff members were friendlier than others, but overall everyone was helpful. They were even helpful before we got there. I changed my mind about room arrangements (we were traveling with a friend who needed a separate room), and they sorted everything out for us before we got there.We鈥檝e stayed in other hotels with shared restrooms, and this is one of the better ones. Only two to three rooms share a restroom, and they were always clean.A laptop with Internet was available in the lobby from early in the morning until late at night. There was a ten-minute time limit if someone was waiting, but it was free to guests.Breakfast was provided in the restaurant downstairs, the price of which was included in the room charge. It was so filling that we usually had a biscuit or two leftover to take for a snack.We were there in the winter, and the room stayed well-heated throughout the night.The BadIt鈥檚 right across from the Circular Quay and on a main street, so it was noisy. You will need your earplugs.The bed and a large armoire took up most of the space in the room, so there wasn鈥檛 a whole lot of room to walk around.OverallIf we wanted luxury, we know we should have stayed in a different hotel. But we were quite content staying here and paying half the price.

<Content>Great Hotel I've just returned from my 4 week trip to Aus, and the first night we arrived in Sydney we stayed at this hotel. When we first arrived we weren't really sure what to expect, having booked it based on the reviews and recommendations on this site. We were not disappointed. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was great, (clean, good view and comfortable)and the location right by circular quay was perfect - we were even upgraded. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone else.

<Content>Right on top of Harbour Bridge  Just got back from a 5 week trip to Australia with my husband - we arrived at The Russell late on a Friday night and couldn't believe the number of 'boy racers' driving up and down revving their engines and with blasting stereos - it was like Southend sea front!! Unfortunately it was just the same on the Saturday evening but was fine on the Sunday so we guessed it must be a weekend thing! The reason for mentioning this is that as the The Russell doesn't have air conditioning you need to leave your windows open which meant it was pretty noisy! We were okay as we were out and about and don't go to bed until late but if you like being in bed quite early or need peace  quiet to drop off then I would bear this in mind and we were surprised that it hadn't been mentioned before! Regarding the hotel itself - we booked a double room with shared bathroom for 3 nights. The points made previously about there being a lot of stairs are true - if you're staying at the top of the hotel it does give you a bit of a work out going up and down them on a hot day but if you're fit and healthy it shouldn't be too much of a problem! The room was clean but rather tired looking - we found the main problem was lack of space. There were 2 shared bathrooms near us; one very large with 2 sinks and one smaller which were absolutely fine. Breakfast was good and we found the staff to be friendly. We managed to get a little look into the larger en suite rooms and these obviously look much nicer but I'm not sure if it would be worth paying the extra for these, personally if I was going to pay a lot more for a hotel then I would stay elsewhere. The hotel is in a great location (which is what you pay for) for the Opera House and Harbour Bridge but you still need to get train/bus/cab to the other sights that are away from The Rocks area anyway so we came to the conclusion that it's not the be all and end all to stay in this area.

<Content>Quaint and historic Good hotel to get a feel of what Sydney was like years ago. We stayed here back in late 2002 and I agree with many comments on the rooms themselves being a little drab and small (and hot) but the breakfast/dining room was great; wooden pannelled walls - we could have spent all morning in there drinking coffee and listening to the classical music; very relaxing in the mornings before a hectic day down-town. Great location.

<Content>Terrible Hotel but great location... We stayed at the Russell for 7 nights and by the end of it were very glad to leave.. Whilst the location is great - very close to the opera house, harbour bridge etc. the staff are unfriendly (in fact, I found them rude), the rooms are small and very dark, the bathrooms minute and there is no air conditioning, add to that outside noise and lack of security (someone was burgled when we stayed there).Overall, if you are thinking of staying in the Rocks choose somewhere else as this is overpriced for what it is.

<Content>It's the real deal We've stayed here on 2 visits to Sydney, and it is a very nice place. Each room is different, all are furnished nicely. The location is the best in Sydney, right on the harbor, in The Rocks area of the city. Fabulous breakfast, too. However, there is a long winding staircase and no elevator, so not great if you've got a ton of luggage. If you are looking for a hotel with some individuality and soul, this is it.

<Content>too hot for comfort Stayed here in february 2005. The room looked nice but the bathroom had no ventilation and there was just a ceiling fan over the bed. Because the room backed onto an enclosed yard there was no air flow. There were also problems with the breakfast being rather stingy for the price and we took ourselves elsewhere (the Rocks cafe over the road is fine). In the end we dreaded going back at the end of the day, knowing we would boil all night even.

<Content>Great location, but.... I found this hotel through Hotels.com, and liked the price, location, and quaint feel to it. I read the reviews on Tripadvisor.com, and was concerned with the number of reviews which loved it, and the ones that hated it - polar views! We stayed in the hotel for five nights, in a superior room, which means we had our own bathroom and didn't have to share with one down the hall as some bedrooms must do. We also had a kitchen, which we didn't use. Here are the pros and cons, from our perspective.Pros: Great location! Probably one of the best. It's about 200 yards from Circular Quay, where all the ferries and water taxis depart, near the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Bridge, and is in the middle of the Rocks, which is an older section of Sydney which has been preserved and is interesting in so many ways.Cost is reasonable, particularly if you compare it to other hotels which are roughly in the same vicinity (Hilton, Four Seasons, Shangri-la, etc.).Cons:Noise! Bring earplugs to wear at night (no joking - we used ours from our Quantas flight). Our room fronted on the street which was busy with trucks, buses, and cars at all hours. The back was on a mini-courtyard, where every voice was amplified. Since we were on the third floor with nobody above us, we don't know if rooms on the second floor have the added annoyance of folks walking on squeaky floors above them, but I'd assume that this would be an additional noise to contend with. It's an old building without an elevator. Be prepared to climb narrow stairs. The checkin desk is on the second floor (a restaurant covers the first floor), and while there are a number of rooms on the second floor, the superior rooms are on the third floor.TV coverage is marginal. There are only about 11 channels, and CNN (one that we like to watch) had incredibly poor reception. Maybe all the TV satellites are in the northern hemisphere?As mentioned above, the floors squeak. In addition, there was a raised (1 inch) tile floor for the kitchen, without any transition. My wife stubbed her toe badly and went down hard.No internet connection for checking emails. However, there is an internet cafe in a convenience store about two blocks away with reasonable prices ($2 for 15 minutes). Lack of wardrobe/storage. There was a closet with a few shelves, but no chest of drawers. We were in Australia for two weeks and had lots of clothes to stow, with almost no place to put it. HVAC is questionable. We had a large space heater which was adequate, but I wondered what the place would be like in their summer season. There was no central A/C, and not even a window A/C. The only answer is to open the windows which would hardly be sufficient (and adds to the noise problem mentioned above).Lack of maintenance on some items. Our shower leaked water all the time. The blinds in the bathroom wouldn't operate to twist them open or close, and they were stuck in the not-quite-closed position, which left us feeling like folks could watch us. Maintaining a steady water temperature in the shower was challenging, and not due to other rooms flushing toilets or causing water pressure fluctuations - the cold water valve would simply and magically begin to close off continuously.We were accustomed to the other hotels we stayed in having 110V outlets in the bathrooms (for shavers, etc.). The Russell did not have this - only the 220V standard in Australia. In addition to being a higher voltage, the outlets are different than for a 110V system in the USA. We brought conversion plugs, but as it turns out, we apparently brought the wrong ones, and had to ask the hotel staff for a conversion plug. I was surprised when they couldn't immediately provide one. They were all checked out and we finally got one from them later that night. I would've expected the hotel to have dozens of these conversion plugs...All in all, we had a wonderful time in Australia, and genuinely liked the location of the Russell hotel, however, knowing what I know now, I'd probably look more seriously at another hotel.

The location is the best thing about this hotel - only minutes from Circular Quay, close to the Opera House and steps from great restaurants and cafes.The staff are extremely friendly and helpfull, ready to help with anything, especially your bags, there is no elevator (heritage building).The rooms are small but very cozy, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Location - Not for snobs! I stayed at The Russell during a weekend trip to Sydney.This charming hotel is very well priced considering it's location. It's right in the heart of The Rocks with Circular Quay directly across the road. Even the Opera House is within walking distance which is fantastic.I stayed in superior double ensuite which is a great sized room with its own bathroom. While there I did take a peek at some of the other rooms which is recommended as all the rooms are different. There is definitely a room to suit most budgets.There are only 29 rooms which makes the place friendly  intimate between guests  staff and it is the kind of place that makes you feel right at home with chocolate treats and a welcoming jar of great jelly beans.There is no lift to the hotel due to the building being heritage listed but the staff are really helpful and offer to assist as a courtesy. While I was there I did however notice a young male guest arriving who was less than gracious about the absence of a lift and watched while the female staff carried his bag up the stairs. This is a special place - definitely for the seasoned traveller who appreciates a historical place with lots of character.Not for a guest with pretensions but a slim wallet.

<Content>For Backpackers! Do not stay here if you have a lot of luggage. There is no lift, only a narrow winding staircase. If you are traveling out of a backpack then you will be fine. Stayed at the Russell March 2005. It is in the center of the Sydney Rocks area. The hotel is a historic building and they can not add modern conveniences such as air conditioning and elevators. We stayed only one night. We were glad that we didn't make reservations for more than that.

<Content>Almost Bad Excellent location, nice folk, lousy product. This hotel was the most unpleasant, uncomfortable hotel stay in years. Somebody needs to take over this hotel and turn it into an upscale boutique. Try the Holiday Inn instead, really!

<Content>Very, very small The rooms are incredibly small. We only had room to put one small suitcase on the floor and still walk around the best. The furniture is vintage - interesting, but not functional (drawers don't open, holes in bottoms of drawers). Bathrooms are also incredibly small with no place to set anything. Really wouldn't advise sharing a bathroom here. The shared bathroom were 2 foot by 2 foot. No exaggeration. Staff was friendly, but never actually helpful. (Didn't have ice, didn't know good restaurants in the area.) The complimentary breakfast was unusually good.

<Content>A terrible experience My wife and I just returned from a month in Australia and New Zealand. We chose the Russell Hotel based on recomendations from travel agents and web-sites. I would have to say, that we would never consider staying in this hotel again. The staff was rude and not very accomodating. Our room was located in the front, overlooking a very noisy street, and directly above a tavern with a band that played until 3:00 in the morning. They did move us to a different room for the following three nights, but were very reluctant to make any adjustment for that first evening. Eventually, they gave us $50 off the first night's rate. Anyone seeking a quiet room in Sydney should definitely stay away! Oh, did I mention the 42 stairs we had to climb with our luggage and no help from anyone in the hotel?
