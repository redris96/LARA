<Content>Great place at a great location We found this hotel through Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. The hotel is right next to the Ramblas and close to the main plaza, so your're within walking distance of major transport and night life. The hotel itself is very well kept, much better than most hotels of this size I've been in. There is a computer with internet available, and plenty of reas where you can sit down and rest or relax.The staff is courteous, helpful and always greets you with a smile.In my opinion, you get much more for your Euro here than at any other similar hostel in Barcelona.If/when I go back to Barcelona I will definately stay here again.

<Content>lovely homely place to stay We chose to stay at the hosteria grau after looking for a budget place to stay on trip advisor, everywhere else in the same location seemed very expensive, and this was a bargain, 30 pounds per person per night! and that was for a private double room with bathroom! and i had noticed it had some very good reviews so thought we would try it, we booked the flight through easyjet liverpool, which was great, no hassle at all, from the airport we caught the train into barcelona, this was a bit of an adventure as we had a map from the hotel website, and followed other travellers instructions as to how to get to the hotel, which came in very useful!! we caught the train from the airport to placa catalunya, but looking back i would advise you to get the bus, direct from the airport to placa catalunya, as it runs from outside the terminal direct to placa catalunya, we got this back to the airport on the sunday as the trains werent running when we left on the sunday morning, the buses are very regular, quick cheap and direct! there was a lot of messing about on the train and you have to swap stations, it isnt direct!, but it was fun trying to figure it all out! i like a challenge! anyway when we finally got on the correct train into placa catalunya, you have a 5 minute walk to the hostel, you walk past the triangle shopping centre which if you get off the bus is on the opposite side of placa catalunya, walk down there, and the street leading down to the hotel is the second left, at the pull and bear clothes shop, our first impressions of the hostel was that it was on a beautiful street full of character, lovely buildings, and the hostel itself is very pretty, inside the girl at the desk was warm and welcoming, and had no problems with our booking and spoke excellent english, she gave us lots of advise of what to see and where to go to eat etc, the room wasnt ready, but she had a lockup room for us to put our luggage, so we went off to explore the city for a few hours, and our room was ready for 2pm, we had booked a private double room with a bathroom, which i was pleasantly suprised with, as it was a hostel, i was expecting it to be a bit basic, as with hostels i had stayed in before, but it was more like a british bed and breakfast type accomodation, the room was small but very modern, with a shower room, a toilet and sink room, and bedroom, there was definately no view from the window! just a wall, but it was clean, modern and comfortable, it also had a safe which was great! and they supplied clean towels and toiletries, we were on the top floor, on the 2nd floor was a comfortable seating area with internet connection, and on the ground floor the reception etc, i thought it was lovely and cosy! they have a coffee shop next door that we didnt use, and the surrounding streets were great, full of character, you are literally a short stroll from la rambla, and all the other tourist areas, it is very central, about a ten minute walk to the marina at the bottom of la rambla, and a fifteen minute walk to the beach, and a 5 minute walk to the excellent shopping on placa catalunya, the city is so pretty and the beach and port are lovely, it has everything there, but have some comfy shoes!! lots and lots of walking!!! the arc de triomph and la sagrada familia are quite a long way away, but definately worth visiting, you will be best getting the tube to see them!! in the evening the entertainment was excellent, loads of bars to visit and loads of places to explore, la rambla is lovely lots of street entertainers, we went to a lovely restaurant off la rambla, so it wasnt so pricey, called sitges on carrer de les sitges, 3. we had the best steak we had had in ages, that was our anniversary night so it was all about romance and having a lovely meal, the following night was just more about going for a drink and having some fun! and we found a fab irish bar off la rambla, i know your going to think typical brit finding a british pub to spend the night, but other than that its pretty much eating and tapas, its supposed to have a really good club scene as well, but from where we were we didnt know where that was unfortunately, so we just enjoyed the bars and had an ace time!!

<Content>cosy and central I found the place a good value for money considering it was in a very central position, just off the Ramblas and Playa de Catalunya. The room was clean, well furnished and confy. The bathroom looked newly fitted. As it is just ouside the Rambla it was not in a real quiet location so you could expect people walking along the streets at every hour but it was definitely a good choice! I would stay there again..

<Content>Hosteria Grau, a satisfactory place The Hotel was a bit run down but not too bad. Overall it was clean.There was free internet which was appreciated.The staff were not overly friendly or informative.Breakfast was extra next door at a smoky cafe....there is plenty of such smoky places in Barcelona. We walked to La Rambla and found a full English breakfast for the same price.The Hosteria is on a small street with no parking and a lot of strange looking people...tatoos, skate boards, rooster like hair cuts. The location is next to La Ramba therefore handy.

<Content>Tired and bad value for money My partner and I stayed here for a few days and were not overly impressed. The communal areas were nice but our room was quite small, looked quite tired and could have been cleaner. It was nothing in comparison to the lovely places we had stayed in in Madrid and Toledo. Although I'm sure the bed clothes were clean, they had marks on them, which is always a bit off-putting. I think they need to put a bit of the effort expended on the communal areas into the rooms.The reception staff were friendly and helpful enough. But the cleaning staff leave A LOT to be desired. On one occasion after coming back to our room after it had been cleaned, the toilet had QUITE OBVIOUSLY been used by the cleaning staff while they were in there. I say quite obviously because the toilet had splatters of excrement on it. Disgusting! It's not just the fact that a cleaner with diarrhoea used our toilet, but also that they had not cleaned it afterwards!Also, although the cafe bar is actually next door to the hotel, it is in fact promoted and linked to the hotel so it should at least try to maintain some sort of standards there. We had breakfast there on two occasions and regretted it. The first time wasn't so bad but it was nothing special. But the second time we had sausages and eggs for breakfast and it was literally swimming in grease. Completely inedible. The coffee was also completely burnt. Quite disappointing when you take into account the fact that this was the most expensive place we stayed in in Spain.

<Content>Needs a lift and air con We have stayed here before and it is in a great location and the staff are very friendly. We had a apartment on the 4th floor which was just about big enough for the 4 of us as we did not spend to much time there, but my main gripe is the fact that they don鈥檛 have a lift and air conditioning, even a baggage lift would be great but the have nothing and the rooms are so hot and all we had was a couple of fans. and our room was at the back and just looked out at the rear of another building.Before I went I had a problem with my credit card and so they got in touch with me, but while I was waiting for them to get back to me I looked at other places to stay and found one cheaper and with a lift and air con which was actually on La Rambla.So although I really like the location and the staff I would have to think twice about going here if I went back to Barcelona.

Good value for the city centre.

<Content>A fantastic place for a short break We went for 4 nights and stayed in Hosteria Grau which is very near Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya and reasonable walking distance to the harbour. Everything is easily accessible and the bus and tube networks are easy to negotiate Lots of vegetarian eating places including a chain called Fresc Co which provides a salad buffet, hot food, drinks and a few desserts for under 10 euros and you can eat and drink as much as you like. Also Juicy Jones which is just off Las Ramblas and is totally vegan. I thought I might have problems with food but didn't at all.Recommend the open top bus tour. There are 3 different routes covered by one ticket and you just get on and off as you please over one or two days. It helps get an idea of what you want to go back and see. Great architecture, friendly people and great weather. And if you have time, go to Sitges (half an hour by train) for a day at the beach - it's what the locals do!

<Content>Perfectly located I have stayed at Hosteria Grau 5 times since 1999. After staying there initially as a student I returned on each of my subsequent visits to Barcelona. The property is very centrally located without getting too far in to any of the dodgey parts of the city. The accomodation is basic enough but always clean and well maintained. I have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful and would have no hesitation in recommending the place to anyone who wanted a no frills city centre base during a stay in BCN.

<Content>perfect location we booked this hostel through barcelona30.com, we were a bit weary at first as we had never stayed in a hostel before but after checking out website,trip advisor and most of all the price we decided to go for it!!when we arrived to las rambla by bus from airport it was a 10min walk but down a bit of a scary side street (well at first glance)The room was on the third floor with no lift. The room itself was small with unsuite bathroom but comfortable and after site seeing for a full day was welcoming.the location could not have been better a five min walk to the hustle and bustle!!Our flights were not till late evening but we were able to leave our luggage in a room at reception so we could make the most of our last day which was good.We would not think twice about staying here in the future!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Convenient location, and interesting light switches! We stayed at Hosteria Grau for just one night in March, as we wanted somewhere close to Placa Cataluyna, where we were arriving in the evening. The direction instructions given on their website were easy to follow and we arrived at the hostel where they have a 24 hour reception (I believe). The staff were really helpful, especially as my suitcase didn't arrive at the airport, and they were really helpful in phoning the airport for me to check on its progress. The hostel/hotel (not really sure what it is!!) was like an oasis, very homely and inviting, and very clean. There is no lift. The room we had was very clean and looked like it had recently been refurbished. I was impressed with the very clear signs for fire escape, the sprinkler system, and the interesting light switches! It just seemed to be very well run and maintained. (I believe it is a family run place). There is a deposit box in the room which you can use for a few euros a day, but we didn't have a need to use it. The room had a lovely ensuite bathroom with all the bits and pieces you would expect, including towels. Soft drinks are available to buy from reception. The room we stayed in overlooked the street below, and yes you will hear noise at night, not from traffic, but from people who are out late (its a 24 hour place!), but to be honest, you are going to get that at EVERY place you stay at, unless you pay for an expensive hotel with double glazing. but after a while you get used to the hussle and bussle of the city, and its never quiet anywhere! So I would recommend staying here, the rates are extremely reasonable for what you get, and especially as it is very close to Placa Cataluyna, which is where most people arrive on the airport bus. The streets around it aren't the most attractive, and most places are shuttered up at night, but we didn't have any problem. On the first floor there is a communal sitting area, with free internet access, limited to half an hour so that everyone can get a chance to use it. Apparently you can get breakfast at the adjoining bar (pay separately), but it is closed on a sunday, which is when we were there, so we wandered down the street and found somewhere to get coffee and a snack. but in barcelona you are never far from somewhere to eat!

<Content>Charming Hotel Booked here for a weekend in December and just loved it. Front desk staff was kind but not overly helpful as it was someone new who couldnt recommend a restaurant, but no big deal. The hotel was charming and we just loved the details. Booked a double room with separate bathroom and this was no problem at all. The hotel was completely booked although we never saw anyone in the halls or in the bathrooms, hot water was plentiful, and a sink/vanity was in the room itself. Lovely decor, great location right next to las ramblas. Very happy we booked here and recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Grau's apartment's not up to scratch We stayed in an apartment for 3 nights over New Year.The staff were great, really helpful, really friendly, and pointed us to a local restaurant (3 doors or so up the street) that was terrific.However, the apartment was in desperate need of a refurb. And had a pretty unpleasant small in the hall and bathroom. It was also up 5 flights of stairs, and without a lift this could be a real problem if you have any mobility issues.

The beds were made everyday and the whole place was really clean and well cared for. The staff were really helpful and there was free internet access, which was useful for checking bus times. The location of this hotel is excellent 2 mins from las ramblas. On the down side the walls were quite thin and there was no TV . But we would definatley stay here again.

<Content>Nice place, minor problems The Hosteria Grau is at the intersection of two narrow streets off La Ramblas. Although most seem to consider this a great location, I disagree. This neighborhood is lively at night and may be great for college students and youngsters out to party all night 鈥?but its not remotely lively in the manner most traveling to Europe on vacation would want. If you are a young student on a budget who enjoys dirty streets with a ton of graffiti, bars, and local drunks then you will like the location. If, however, your idea of lively-at-night is not honking motorcycles and drunks outside your window all night you will prefer another area of the old town to this. Additionally I fail to see even one redeeming factor in La Ramblas, a truly unattractive street 鈥?a haven for pickpockets, prostitutes and loud tourists. It may be historically interesting to the city, but in its current state, packed with fast food places and tourists, it was quite a disappointment.The Hosteria Grau itself is adequate and the staff is very nice. The hotel is kept locked and they buzz you in, so it seems pretty secure. We were in the top level apartment and there was only two of us, so the place was really huge and at quite a reasonable rate for Barcelona. We had numerous beds to select from, as well as couches. There isn鈥檛 much in the way of dishes 鈥? some form of electric tea maker we did not use and a very small refrigerator. Its not the type of apartment you can stay in for a week and cook, but it鈥檚 a comfortable place to stay at night. The beds are somewhat of a disaster, but no more so than almost anywhere else in Spain at this price level 鈥?mattresses that sink with your body weight 鈥?no support at all. At least the sheets and linens seemed clean- although the comforters were stained. I certainly didn鈥檛 think much of the general housekeeping 鈥?the floors were really not cleaned daily, but were clean enough not to cause great worry. The bathroom is quite old fashioned but adequate, although you can hear many of the other rooms through the tiny central shaft its window opens to.The shower is so tiny one can barely fit in it, but it is kept clean. The door to the shower did not work. The worst part, however, was that you have absolutely no control over the water temperature in this shower. The water will magically alternate between a range of temperatures, seemingly at random, but its shocking because you cannot possibly move out of the way 鈥?there is no space! So you will burn, and you will freeze. There was free internet access in the tiny lobby and staff was always very helpful with suggestions and guidance. There is no air conditioning in the rooms, but in April this was not relevant. So, altogether, despite the problems, I would say that for the price this place is actually an OK Barcelona bargain and I imagine ideal for many a traveler.

<Content>Nice little hostel I stayed there one night in a room without bathroom. This wasn't a problem as the two available shower rooms and toilets were always available when I needed it. The room is furnished simple, but lovely. The staff was friendly and helpful although not always knowledgeable. The location is excellent - just a 3-minute stroll from Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. Overall, definitely worth the money as it is quite cheap compared to other hotels in Barcelona.

<Content>Second visit and its still as lovely as ever! This is my second stay in Hosteria Grau and it is a pleasure to stay there! I was hoping that the standard remained the same as when i visited 3 years ago, as I had told my friend how lovely it was. It didnt disappoint! As you are walking down the alley way off the Ramblas towards the hostel, it can look a bit unnerving with people hanging around and the grafitti on the walls, but thats what most of the side streets are like. As long as you are aware of the people around you and you keep your bag secure you will be fine. We arrived at the hostel at 11.20 pm and there was somone at the reception who was helpful. The room had twin beds which were clean and daily made and a spotless bathroom. The aircon was excellent. There wasnt much of a view from our room unfortunately but we didnt spend much time there!There was always someone to open the door to us regardless of what time we got in and on one occassion when I got in at 8.30am the receptionist told the cleaners to be quiet cos I had just gone to bed. When i went back out at 12.45pm the cleaners came in and made up the room for me then...what service is that!! fantastic!I have no experence of other hotels or hostels in Barcelona as I have only stayed in Hosteria Grau, but I wouldnt question staying here again. Fantastic value for money!

<Content>Great Hostel It's a bit more on the pricey end for a hostel but it's more like a hotel not so much a hostel. You get key cards and your bed is made everyday. They give you fresh towels when you need and supply extra pillows. My sister and I, traveling alone, felt very safe staying here. It's in a great location between La Rambla and Exiample. A short walk to the metro that takes you all over Barcelona. There's a luggage room where you can keep your bags when you check out and so you can still explore the city before you need to catch your late bus/plane.

<Content>Great place to stay!! I stayed here with my girfriends and we had a great time. This hostel has a great location. You are in the center of everything - restaurants, clubs and public transportation. For the price the place is just beautiful too! We stayed in a very spacious apartment with balcony and everything for a very cheap price. When I go back to Barcelona I will definitely stay at this place again. The only thing is that we stayed in the top floor (it was a walk up) and we all packed way too many things and it was hard to get all of our luggage up the stairs-my advice is pack light............or as little as you can.............especially for lugging all of your stuff through the narrow streets of the city.

<Content>Fine, funky place; friendly staff; pricey We stayed here two nights, in two different rooms. Each was fine, including the beds. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Location is excellent. Compared to other venues on our 4-month trip in Europe, the rates seemed a bit high, but perhaps that's just the way it is in Barcelona. We'd consider staying here again.

The rooms are ok (if you are fine with no tv), there was more than enough space for my stuff. The rooms can be a bit hot since there is no air conditioner although they do provide a fan but you probably won't spend too much time in the room. For the price and the excellent location (La Rambla is right around the corner) you really can't complain, I would stay here again.

<Content>Horrible Beds! We stayed in this hotel after reading some of the reviews. This is the only hotel on a 3 week trip through Spain that we actually changed. The room was very small which we can live with, but the bed was horrible. We did not sleep the whole night. The room had one window that opened to a small fire escape type of thing so you could get no air. There was a fan in the room that blew directly in our face all night. Then in the morning we got exactly 1 minute worth of hot water per person in the shower. The location is great and the staff was very helpful when we wanted to change hotels. But I would have a very hard time recomending it. I would say to at least lay on the bed before accepting the room.

<Content>Apartment Was Great! We stayed 6 nights in their third floor apartment in October 2005 and can definitely recommend it for the budget-minded tourist.On the positive side, we found the staff to be exceptionally helpful and friendly. By the way, this was the only hotel we stayed at in Spain where English was spoken fluently by everyone we encountered at the front desk. Reservations were made directly with the hotel via email and we received the room exactly as pre-arranged.The apartment was basic but had two bedrooms plus a pull-out sofa in the livingroom. It would be fine for two to five people. It also had a small fridge, a random assortment of dishes and a kettle for making tea or instant coffee. It was spacious and quiet, and you can't beat the central location just off Placa de Catalunya, which is a transportation hub of sorts. Unlike other reviewers, I felt very safe in the area immediately around the hotel. I think Barcelona is one of those cities however where the nature of the streets can change dramatically within a few short blocks, depending also on the time of day. About 8 blocks away in the El Raval area I stumbled on a very shady (we're not in Kansas anymore...) red light district, and some streets in the Barri Gotic definitely gave me the willies at night, so keep your eyes peeled. On the downside, I have to say that the housekeeping was borderline. I don't think they cleaned the floors once during the week we were there. We received dirty bed sheets one day and I had to ask for soap twice while we were there, having run out completely the day before. The shower was very small, so small that bumping the shower tap was unavoidable, resulting in either scalding hot or freezing cold water to wake you from your morning haze. The third floor apartment was actually five floors up with no lift, being preceeded by a main floor and ground floor respectively. Other considerations: there was no AC. This might be a problem in August but in October we felt fine.I cannot comment on the other rooms, but I would definitely consider staying here again in one of the apartments for the great location, helpful reception staff and very reasonable room rates.

<Content>really really lovely 8 of us stayed here for my hen weekend, and for a hostel it is absolutely fantastic! We had one apartment and two separate rooms booked, and we were impressed with everything - security is excellent, manned 24 hours, the apartments, bedding, towels were all immaculate, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The location is perfect - close but not on top of everything. If you are going request a room at the front where you get a lovely little balcony - yes it can be noisy if other people are around but it is all part of the beautiful atmosphere of the city. Cracking!!!If your going as a female group I would recommend visiting the BAHA BEACH CLUB at port olympic - we had an awesome time!

The room was cleaned daily with fresh towels but the bedding, and particularly the pillows, were very VERY smelly. We had to buy pillows and needed lots of alcohol to help us sleep. The room was also noisy. We did stay in one of the apartments a couple of years ago and I don't remember that being as bad; maybe because it was more spacious and airy (it had a lovely little balcony) Still, never again.

<Content>Good location and value Stayed here a few years ago now, for 4 nights in July.Location is EXCELLENT, one block back from Las Ramblas, near Plaza Catalunya. The surrounding streets are quiet, many are pedestrianised, and they have interesting 'real' shops instead of souvenir stalls.Quite spartan, but is one step up from a backpackers hostel, we had a room with private bathroom. No problems with cleanliness at all.It was very quiet throughout our stay, although it must have been quite full, we never really saw anybody apart from the receptionists.View from our window was of a decrepit service area and building site, but apart from that it was a great stay, and the price was excellent considering the location.

<Content>Great Hostel We booked a four-bed ensuite room expecting four beds and a toilet but we were actually given a two room apartment with its own bathroom and living room with tea/coffee making facilities and a fridge! The location couldn't be better - just off La Ramblas in a really quaint little cobbled street. Each room had a balcony and fan. Towels were provided and the room was very clean. The staff were really helpful and there was cheap internet access on site. Overall, Hosteria Grau was great value for money and had lots of character. I'd definately stay again.

<Content>Great deal for price and location We stayed there and are glad we did. Great location, great staff, great price. We rented one of the apartments. It was plain but clean and comfortable. It was a few floors up with no elevator, but my 70-something parents didn't complain a bit and neither did we. It was all part of the adventure. :-)

<Content>Good location, but room was smelly and dingy The hotel is in a great location for Ramblas, but the room we got was very small and dingy, with a smell of sewage. We had one window, but couldn't open it because of the smell (it faced into the service rise). The walls are very thin, meaning there was a lot of noise throughout the night. OK if you're really not concerned about having a pleasant room, and just want a good location, but if you are concerned about the pleasantness of the room then look elsewhere!

<Content>Ideal, Cheap and great location... I have stayed in this hostel before some 3 years ago, and I was a bit dubious before going the first time, but after seeing their 'own' website, I felt that little bit re-assured.I went back the second time to Hosteria Grau as I think it's perfect for the location (1 minute walk from La Ramblas), and it's a very friendly place to stay. When I her the term 'hostel' I imagined backpackers, noisy atmosphere, and quite run down BUT, the Hosteria Grau was the complete opposite. It has a very traditional Catalan feel about it, and the staff are friendly upon your arrival and speak very good english. The HG is very clean in deed, and well maintained. The room I stayed in the first time 3 years ago had a toilet and shower within our room, and a pretty balcony overlooking the alley way, however, i believe these rooms on the 2nd floor are currently being refurbished, so the only rooms are available as far as we were told the 2nd time are rooms without a shower/toilet. My stay in the HG recently, myself and my b/friend stayed on the first floor (room 116) and i believe this was the only room to have a shower in it, on that floor, so we were quite lucky (worth contacting HG via email first to clarify what rooms they have). The room was very clean, and fresh towels daily. I was very impressed in general with this hostel for the cleanliness, friendliness and how cheap it is to stay there (check out their website @ -----------------------) - i mean, let's face it, you'll only be sleeping there won't you, so if you just want a bed to sleep in, and general cleanliness, then this is the place for you!I admit it's slightly inconvenient having to go the communal toilet, but i must stress that it is cleaned and looked after (just look at it as going the toilet in a pub...), and I never ever found the place to be that busy were you can't go the toilet, or get a shower. I was quite concerned about whether it would be a noisy place, but after 11-11:30pm, it was a very quite place to stay.The security is very reassuring too. There is someone on reception 24 hours a day, and the rooms have a double lock on them; very secure.I would definately stay here again, and recommend the HG to anyone!

<Content>Hosteria Grau Hosteria Grau, is in a good location. It's close to La Rambles, shops, bars and the train station.But I would not go in summer because it has no air conditioning. I also found the rooms to be very noisey.The room prices are quite good value for money and the hostel is quite clean and tidy.
