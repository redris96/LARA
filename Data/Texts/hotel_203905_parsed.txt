<Content>Wonderful, beautiful hotel We stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Berchielli. It was Fabulous. The hotel's location is perfect. Very close and short walking distance to major sights in Florence. Also close to restaurants  shops. Our room was beautiful  elegant. The hotel is immaculate. All the staff was friendly  helpful. Giovanni, who runs the bar in the evening, was professional, efficient  courteous. Breakfast was great too. Stay at the Hotel Berchielli. You will love it!

<Content>Great stay at Berchielli We stayed at the Berchielli for a long weekend and had a great time. Ok, no fabulous river view but if this is important maybe best to say when booking. Not important to us as one of the main reasons for choosing the hotel, after much research, was its very central location. This was perfect, near to all the major places we wanted to see in our limited time, (we were attending a wedding as well as seeing the sights). Most sites of interest are within 5/10 minutes walk. Our room was on the side of the hotel overlooking the wall of the next building but was clean, large enough and had everything we needed. It was quite dark but we did not spend enough time inside to worry. The art deco bathroom was very brightly tiled and I loved it. The only problem I had in the room was that my travel adaptor wouldn't fit the plugs, I think quite a new one is required. Beds were comfortable and towels and linen were changed every day. A bulb blew in one of the lamps and there was no problem in reporting it and someone coming to change it. All the staff at reception were helpful, particularly in organising taxis for us. The breakfast was great, there was plenty of choice, although a few things did run out if we came later. The large breakfast room was bright and had staff to get hot drinks - no awful machines. Maybe we were lucky but we did not have a problem with noise, and rarely heard other guests. We did hear some noise from the street when we had the window open but I would expect that in a city centre. All in all we had a great stay at the Berchielli, and would definitely go back again.

<Content>Number 507 :) If you are staying in Berchielli for great views of them - keep away from 507 number! Hotel doesn't look that crammed, so I believe they will relocate you on request. Otherwise, if you are looking for quiet and silence - this tower-located room with own stair and small windows is a best getaway in the center of Florence.The whole hotel is pretty good, I personally think that it is one of the best value for money in the neighborhood. All (I mean - ALL) the main attractions are in 5, max. 10 minutes walking distance, 3 major bus routes are intersected 50 meters from the entrance. At the same time you can walk to/from S.M.Novella train station in about 15 minutes along beautiful Florentine streets, no need to call taxi.Breakfast is quite good also (which is important for serious travellers), should check out tea room and the roof garden. Staff is generally welcoming, but sometimes looks preoccupied. Public PC with Internet access on the reception certainly was installed at the same time hotel was build :) Ask the reception for prepaid tickets to Uffizi 鈥?will save yourself a lot of waiting time in line.

<Content>Felt better than home for two weeks! We spent a long time researching Florence hotels for our 2-week 50th anniversary stay in Florence. What a find! This is a wonderful hotel because of: large, welcoming lobby and bar area with all leather couches and chairs and live gardenia plants; outstandingly helpful front desk staff who served like concierges; two elevators; fantastic location directly on the Arno River and close to nearly all attractions; outstanding, large breakfast room with great variety ofhot and cold foods and superb croissants, white table cloths changed after each table use, uniformed servers for variety of breakfast beverages including cappucino, fresh flowers on each table; a terrific deluxe large room with two huge windows that opened onto the Arno with the Ponte Vechhio close in sight, with a large all marble bathroom,wonderful housekeeping and flexible lighting; a delightful roof garden; close proximity to many good restaurants and trattorias (preferred family-run eateries); in-room safe; and much more. We'll never stay anywhere else in Florence. Only drawback: flat pillows.

<Content>Loved our stay at Hotel Berchielli We spent a week at the Hotel Berchielli while visiting my daughter who is studying abroad in Florence. We had a lovely room with a river view. A little noisy at night however it did not bother us. The location could not be better and we were only a short walk from everywhere we wanted to go. The staff was very helpful with museum reservations and restaurant recommendations. The buffet breakfast was excellent and we loved having a small bar available to have a glass of wine at the end of the day!

<Content>Great Place to Stay in Florence! Hotel Berchielli is a charming hotel. The front desk staff were nice and accommodating, but not overly so. The hotel bartender, Giovanni, was wonderful and we had some wonderful conversations with him. The room was a triple, it was very big with two beds in one room and the third bed in a separate room. We also had 2 bathrooms, which was nice. The breakfast was wonderful, they offered both hot (eggs/sausages) and cold items (cereal, yogurt, meats, cheeses, etc). The hotel is within walking distance of most everything you would like to see in Florence. The food in Florence is outstanding and we would recommend a restaurant called Celestina. You cannot go wrong staying in this hotel!

<Content>wonderful hotel We have stayed at the Berchielli twice, in January 1992 and November 2006, both times we have thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff have always been extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfasts are excellent with a wide selection of diferent foods to suit all tastes and the breakfast room is elegant and beautiful.The bedrooms are a little faded, but are clean and spacious. We had an emorous bathroom with a wonderful view out to the small courtyard outside the side entrance to the hotel.The location of the hotel is its main selling pint. You are within a few steps of all the mayor sights.We adore Florence and whenever we visit would always stay at the Berchielli

<Content>Noisy and depressing We stayed for 4 day in January. Great location, approx 2 minutes to the Ponte Veccio. Hotel was very noisy as building works were going on, once till well after midnight. Upon complaining the next morning staff very much displayed a so what attitude. The room where you have your breakfast is one of the most depressing you will ever see, dark with no daylight, curtains remain firmly [--] - reminded me of a funeral parlour. Breakfast features a lot of stale bread. Would not stay again, typical tourist hotel, you can do better in Florence.Claudia  Chris

<Content>Great Location This hotel is in a fantastic location, very near the Ponte Vecchio and Uffizi. The breakfast was the highlight of this hotel and offered practically everything you could want. The guest room was large by Italian standards, but a bit tired and plain---not as lavish as other hotels during out trip but comfortable enough. The bathroom was small with little counter space. There was a desk that we used as a vanity. The water pressure from the shower head was very strong---near painful even. Our room opened to a quiet courtyard and we had no problem with noise. The staff were friendly.

<Content>A terrific hotel in Florence We had two rooms at the Berchielli for three nights in September 2007, and this is a terrific hotel for visiting Florence. When we checked in we asked if we could be upgraded and we were told that we had been. The rooms faced out on the Arno River each with a balcony and views of the Ponte Vecchio Bridge which is a half block away. For exploring Florence this location can't be beat. Everything is an easy walk. The rooms were comfortable and nicely sized and the bathrooms were very nice. The rooms had Frette linens and towels. The hotel had a nice lobby lounge and bar and a great rooftop terrace. The included breakfast was excellent and extensive with hot and cold foods. The hotel has a lot of charm and a very friendly staff. They have a computer station in the lobby with free internet access. Since the hotel is made up of a number of older buildings, the room views, sizes and features vary. You may want to see what is available when booking, or ask for features you may want. The Berchielli is an excellent choice for visiting Florence.

My room was sensational (purely luck of the draw) with terrace AND a private patio . L inens are ironed, room was immaculate with designer amenities , large lovely bathroom and a fabulous breakfast (hot and cold)) with the best cappucino in town and drizzled with hot chocolate on top! I go to Florence every year and now would not consider staying anywhere else. The front desk and rest of the staff were friendly, helpful and gave great advice when asked. I highly recommend the Berchielli ...you will love it.

<Content>Loved Berchielli Hotel Berchielli is overall a very nice hotel, staffed with very helpful, friendly concierge. When we were having a hard time driving to the hotel because of road closings (construction), they were accommodating... they readily handed out maps of Florence to help us tour the city...I enjoyed the view of the river and appreciated the large modern bath. Breakfast was nice (not the best in Italy.. but sufficient). Great location for walking everywhere...Highly recommended overall!

<Content>Wedding in Florence My wife and I were invited to a wedding at Palazzo Vechio in September and wanted a good hotel within reasonable walking distance. After much research using Trip Advisor ( we had visited Florence twice before but the last time was 4 years ago and we stayed in a B  B hotel in Piazza Signoria but wanted a full service hotel this time) we decided on Berchielli.We were not disappointed at all , we booked a de-luxe river view and the street noise did not bother us at all. The room was of a good size , as was the bathroom , which is always a pleasant surprise in Italy, and the view is unique.We found all the staff extremely pleasant and helpful , especially the concierge, Massimo.I have to say that I think the few bad reviews that this hotel has received have been caused by differences in culture or practise, e.g. one reviewer complained that the taxi back from the hotel to the station cost more than going , that is because you pay for the distance from the taxi rank to the hotel to pick you up , in my experience this is the same in France.If you want a well located hotel, that is well maintained , with a reasonable breakfast at a fair price , pick the Berchielli.

<Content>Highly recommend the Berchielli We spent 2 nights at the Berchielli last week, and the experience was completely delightful: perfect location (on the river, an easy walk to the Ponte Vecchio); friendly, attentive staff; spotless, attractive rooms; and an excellent (hot) American breakfast. Other family members had spectacular river views through 2 huge windows in their rooms. My single room, which I referred to as the princess room, since you went up 2 flights of stairs to enter the sleeping/bath area after you came in the door, had no view, but was so delightfully quiet that I happily accepted the trade-off. The size of the hotel was perfect, with a boutique atmosphere.I loved Florence, and will hope to have the opportunity to return and enjoy the Berchielli again.

<Content>Beautiful Florence and Hotel Berchielli An excellent hotel in a wonderful location, just yards from the Ponte Vecchio, but in a reasonably quiet spot. Our room (207), with no balcony, overlooked a tiny piazza with a small chapel. The room was clean, a good size, with a lovely bathroom. Breakfast was continental with a good selection of meats, cheeses, cereals and fruit. Staff were professional and helpful. Terrace garden on the 4th floor is worth finding for a late afternoon tea to rest for a while.Would definitely stay again, particularly because of its location and high standards of service.

<Content>perfect room, perfect location We stayed at the Berchielli on a busy sat night and fell in love with the room  locationOur room (104) had a balacony, overlooking the river and was spacious and very comfortable. On the whole the staff were pleasant, and the receptionist was very helpful when planning our trip. Two things stopped this getting an excellent.1. The breakfast was only okay, and in my opinion could be improved. 2. We called a taxi to get to the train station - a 7鈧?trip to the hotel became a 鈧?3 on the way back. It took about 4 mins and I know we were ripped off - while not directly the hotels fault I believe they must be aware of the firm they use.

<Content>Would not return to this hotel We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the end of May. Our experience was less than positive from the moment we walked into the hotel.The reception and all staff are rude and unaccomodating. Our room was filthy with dead bugs on the walls and ceilings. Although we were eventually changed rooms, it was not without a hassle. We were spoken to by another family that had encountered the same problem the day previous to our complaint.The night reception could provide no information and/or assistance for local information on important things like the taxi strike that occurred whilst we were there. Nor were they readily available when we checked out early in the morning.. we actually had to search for their 'resting area' to check out!The location of the hotel is fine, the breakfast is standard, and would probably be better if the staff were pleasant. Overall, being a guest in this hotel was more like being an imposition to the staff. If we had not experienced more of Italy prior to this hotel visit, my impression of Italy and the culture would be seriously flawed!

<Content>We made a good choice! My friend and I have just returned from a trip to Florence. We stayed for 5 nights at the Berchielli and were really impressed. The room overlooked a small courtyard and was of an adequate size. The bathroom was huge and the daily standard of cleanliness very high. The breakfast room was very impressive with a huge choice of unlimited food. Some of the waiters were friendlier than others though the staff at reception were always courteous and helpful. The only drawback was that our room was above a side entrance where the sound of the automatic doors opening and closing into the early hours of the morning and from about 5.30am onwards, gave us some disturbed nights. I was also concerned about the poor energy policy in that televisions were fixed on standby 24 hours per day and towels were replaced every day whether it was requested or not. Overall however ,we felt it to be a well-run hotel in an ideal location.

<Content>Great staff, rooms and breakfast!! I stayed at this hotel in July of 2006 during my trip to Italy. What an amazing hotel. Breakfast was great. I have to say we only ever ate this meal there because there were so many other places to eat and travel to! The breakfast was a buffet style and lots to offer. From eggs, to bacon, to sandwich meat, to breads and many spreads and jellies! I even brought some home because there were that easy to take! A lso I recommend ordering a cappuccino for breakfast! Three of the days there the frothed milk was in the shape of a heart in the cappuccino! And it was delicious! This hotel is also always ready to accomodate to your needs. Whether it be to make a dinner reservation or to get you a driver to tour Tuscany or even to the airport. They always went out of their way to help my family and me. And trust me, we were down there everyday! With four other women of all generations, one of us always had a question we felt needed to be answered! They never seemed bothered and were always happy to help! The bartender is very friendly too! You'll have a good time with him if you go down there after dinner to have a drink.The rooms are gorgeous! Two of us stayed in double room which was like your normal hotel room. It had two nice double beds, and a nice well kept bathroom. The other three were in a triple suite right next door (they accomodated us when we asked to have our rooms side by side). This room was fantastic. It had a main little hallway, a single bedroom on the right, and the bathroom on the left. And then at the end of the hallway a bedroom with two beds and another bathroom. Perfect for all of us! The beds were great. Nothing special, but just what you needed after a tiring day touring Firenze!Plus, the location of this hotel was perfect! Right on the canal and just a little walk away from the Ponte Vecchio we never had a problem getting anywhere. Especially with my grandma, we had no problem walking where we needed to go! Great views and spot near all the squares, shops, and restaurants!I can't say enough about this hotel. Everyone of them did everything they could to make our hotel stay great! When I go back to Florence I will definitely be staying here! Thanks so much staff! I also recommend taking a day trip to see some of the outside towns and especially to go visit a winery! What a great experience!

<Content>Location, location, location What a marvellous find. This seemingly small hotel packs a lot into the unobtrusive building. Our room overlooked the small square of the entrance loby away from the river. Very quiet, well appointed, excellent bathroom and comfortable bed. All the facilities that you need away from home! Staff were extremely efficient and helpful. Breakfasts were a feast with cooked food as well as continental style items. All this combined with very attentive and helpful staff.Location gave access to all the main attractions and museums of Florence within a twenty minute stroll. Eating out for evening meals was a joy, spoilt for choice really, and meals were not expensive by UK standards.Recommend this hotel to lovers of Italy and Florence in particular

<Content>Berchielli, fabulous hotel We spent six nights at the Berchielli and it was fabulous. Our room overlooked the Arno River. Great views of the river and the Ponte Vechio. We are a very picky New York City couple and we could not find anything that was not perfect. We did not experience any disturbing noise form the street with the windows closed. Great breakfast with fresh baked items and fruit. Incredible espresso to get us going each morning. It is only a short walk from the train station. The staff was helpful and recommended several non tourist restaurants and a local movie theater. Free internet in the lobby, clean spacious rooms, nice bathroom with tub, shower and bidet. What more could we want? We loved leaving the curtains open and letting the early morning sun wake us in the very comfy king sized bed.

<Content>Great Location  We spent 4 nights last week at the Hotel Berchielli  as I always check anywhere we are going with Tripadvisor before I book (quite obsessively) I felt I had to tell others what a great choice we made.We last visited 9 years ago  stayed near San Lorenzo but I wanted to stay elsewhere  after hours of searching  cross checking with Tripadvisor I finally chose the Berchielli. Some of the reviews I read before we left gave me cause to worry but that all changed when we arrived. I am very fussy about hotels  have been lucky enough to stay in lots of great hotels all over the world, but I'm sensible enough to know with a city break you don't spend much time in your room. STILL I do like it to be nice  very clean  hopefully with good service. Well we got more than that with the Berchielli. I requested a room at the front (despite other reviews saying how noisy it was) and we had room 503 which to my delight was lovely. It was large with 2 big windows overlooking the street / river below  views to the Ponte Vecchio.We had ample wardrobe space  a safe inside, writing desk  chair, large comfy armchair  flat screen tv, ample lamps to light the room  the twin beds were quickly made into a king at our request. The bathroom had a normal size bath  good shower overhead, 2 sinks,shaving mirror. hairdryer, bidet  plenty of toiletries on offer. It was very clean  there were no dreadful plumbing noises to be heard anywhere. The cleaners did a great job everyday  we had clean sheets  towels everyday. We found all the staff to be friendly  helpful and the breakfast was much better than you normally find in European cities. There were cereals, fresh fruit, fruit salad, prunes, yoghurts, cold meats  cheeses, croissants, jams, loads of different breads, jams, ryvitas, fruit juices, and a hot breakfast selection as well. The capuccinos were to die for (as you'd hope for in Italy really ).We thought the location was great as you could easily access both sides of the river  nowhere is far to walk to in Florence anyway. (The views from Piazzale Michelangelo back across the city are well worth the walk on a clear day.) I will admit that the rooms at the front of the hotel can be a bit noisy during the night because of the traffic on the one way street below, but you should be that tired from your days of exploring the wonderful city that you won't notice. Alternatively you can request a back room, but I loved drawing back the curtains each morning  admiring the wonderful sights and sounds of one of the best cities in the world.I would never do this lightly as Everyone has different opinions on places but I WOULD RECOMMEND the Hotel Berchielli. Book now  have a great time!!

<Content>On the Arno This very professionally run hotel is on the River Arno and very convenient to most sites. Great breakfast, and the hotel staff was very helpful with reservations, directions, etc. The room was adequate, and the bath was definitely the best we had in Europe. I would recommend this to anyone, especially someone wanting a quiet getaway.

<Content>Wonderful, romantic, convenient! We stayed here on our honeymoon and returned 10 years later. The first time we had a room with a river view, which was absolutely worth getting, but this time, even the little room over the courtyard was lovely. Breakfast is delicious, the location is perfect, the staff is quite helpful and although the room was slightly sterile, the place oozes romance.

<Content>Nice hotel We had a pleasant 3-night stay at the Berchielli in late September. It's in a nice location on the river, close to the markets, the Duomo, the Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi. The rooms were good-sized and I loved the big windows, but the beds seemed a little small (even by European standards). The hotel bar was really popular while we were there and they have free Internet access in the lobby. The front desk people were not very friendly, but the bellmen, bartender and the waiters in the breakfast room were great. And God bless the bellman who helped pack six women and their luggage in our little van! I didn't think we'd all fit, but that man performed a miracle.

<Content>great experience! This hotel was a beautiful retreat after long, hot days of touring around. From the pleasant lobby and staff to our huge, plush rooms. I felt it was quite fancy for a 4 star, since I was expecting 3 star. The decor, furnishings and linens are very nice, as well as the large bathrooms. We had three rooms and all were different. None had a balcony, but the huge windows looked out to nice views, not a wall.You may use electricity in your rooms now. I was worried about how we were going to charge phones and cameras but upon arrival I noticed that there were plenty of outlets and that the previous restriction of it had been whited out in the hotel room binder.Breakfast buffet was excellent and in a beautiful room.I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved it! Just back from 5 nights at this hotel. Was a little apprehensive about reception after some of the previous comments and started off with a detirmined 'bon giorno'. With 1 minor exception -see below- had nothing but helpful and friendly response. Seems a lot of variation in room sizes. Ours was not one of the larger rooms but spotless with good bed linen - a real treat after many US hotels. The very pleasant terrace with chairs and umbrella more than compensated for any minor shortcoming in the room. Thoroughly recommend this hotel. Noticed that restriction on using own electric appliances referred to previously appears to have been lifted - maybe they read this. If so they should check why one of the night staff who would not let me use internet access because he did not know me was prepared to give me the room key!

<Content>Very Nice Hotel This hotel is in a terrific location because it is right near the River Arno and within walking distance to shopping and dining. The rooms are a nice size, comfortable temperatures, and many have small balconies. The best part about Hotel Berchielli is the pleasant and helpful hotel staff. Anytime we had a question or request, they were extremely accommodating. They assisted us in acquiring tickets to see David, as well as setting up a private driver to take us to Pisa and Lucca. One tour we arranged on our own was through Tuscan Trails (see their website by the same name). This company was recommended to us by word of mouth and was absolutely fabulous! Our guide for the day was Toni, and she expertly guided us through the tour which included two wineries and lunch in a stunning family-run osteria.

<Content>Really nice hotel We stayed at this hotel in June 2006. It was a very pleasant experience. The room was small but nice and very clean. Our room had a balcony so we were able to sit outside with our bottle of wine and just enjoy the evenings. The hotel was centrally located and we were in walking distance to almost everything. The staff was very helpful also. They answered all our questions and helped us with some travel tours. We would use this hotel again on our next visit to Florence.

<Content>Electricity... I'd just like to point out that if you travel a lot in Continental Europe then you will find it's common for there to be signs basically saying 'don't use your own electrical appliances in the room'; this is not something unique to this hotel, but seems to be a weird little law or regulation in countries like France and Italy. Realistically it isn't followed or enforced and the hotel doesn't mind if it's just your mobile phone or laptop - but obviously not if you bring a washing machine, power drill etc! I don't know if it's to do with insurance or safety or money-saving for the hotel, but just use your common sense, don't leave things plugged in if you're using an adapter that could over-heat etc. I charged my phone and camera in this hotel and was fine!Also a note on the staff - Americans and British people tend to require eye contact and lots of similes from staff to be happy, but this just isn't normal on the Continent. I remember that the staff were a bit frosty, but in mainland Europe people don't smile much or be very warm unless they actually know you/ are meeting you socially - they're not being rude, it's more of a cultural difference.The hotel was a good, smart and unpretentious choice for Florence with gloriously cool air conditioning! Breakfast was a bit above average, the location was great and my bathroom was down three steps and was very large.PS - Also remember that in Europe star ratings aren't the same as in the US or UK - price is a much better indicator, as a '4 star' hotel in Italy isn't going to have the same specifications as a '4 star' hotel in America, so if it's 4 star, but you're only paying 鈧?5/night don't expect to find the same things that are required to make a hotel 4 star in the UK or America, like minibars, fast internet, movies on demand etc. They seem to give out star ratings more liberally in Italy, France, Germany etc.Hope this helps!

<Content>Best Hotel ever Came on March 2nd 2006  stayed for 4 nights. We were celebrating our Ruby Wedding Anniversary  wanted somewhere special. We had been in Florence for the day 18 months before and promised ourselves we would come back to stay, when it was cooler and quieter. The hotel exceeded all expectations, the room, the service, the cleanliness--not to mention the breakfast !! It's the best we have ever had. The location was perfect. Eventhough it was in the centre, it was very quiet. We got a good deal with Thomas Cooks.We didn't want to leave. It was perfect. It made a perfect end to our celebrations.

<Content>Fantastic!!! We stayed at the Berchielli for 8 nights at the end of May and had a fantastic time! We was getting married whilst in Florence so it was important that we chose a good hotel and we did. Our room was spacious and very clean and we had a huge window that looked out onto a little cobbled back street. The location was perfect and the staff were friendly and accommodating - we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, in fact we was very sad when we had to leave!!

<Content>An adequate experience !! We have just returned from our stay in the Hotel Berchielli in Florence - and I think the previous report captures it nicely. The location is excellent, less than a minutes walk from the Ponte Vecchio, beautifully positioned. Parking to unload your bags is a major pain (aswell as an expensive one,see later, if you have a hire car).The greeting and help from the front desk is poor/ dreadful - you are an annoying interuption to their other important duties - an acknowledgement is probably the most you can expect - but if you don't mind that Basil Fawlty experience then that's OK.Breakfast is good - buffet style with reasonable choice and friendly waiters, one of the Berchielli's better features.Our room was small, overlooking the side entrance to the hotel, with a small bathroom (had to use the bidet for storage) - but it was OK - just.I have noticed Florence has a mosquitoes problem, proximity to the Arno I guess or the time of year, the Berchielli is no different !! Take insect repellent/killer with you or you will get bitten.Florence is starting to get very busy - book your attractions (Uffizi, Academia etc) in advance or you can expect a 40 + minute queue.A word of warning:- if you intend to hire a car (as we did) for our stay, the Berchielli will charge you 31euro per day to park it plus 5 euro service charge, so our week was a touch pricey just on the parking front. I do think it's worth doing though, although maybe hiring locally for a day or 2 would be a better way of doing it. The scenery around Florence is superb as are the lovely towns and villages. San Gimignano, Volterra, Sienna etc.On balance wouldn't recommend - over priced for what you get and there's plenty of competition.

<Content>Berchielli needs some help We loved the location of this hotel and the rooms although small were nice and clean. The breakfast each morning was wonderful and the wait staff very friendly. The front desk staff needs to learn how to greet it's patrons. Not one of our family of 5 was ever even given eye contact by any front desk person nor when we asked a question or advice did we feel like we were nothing more than a bother. Not a friendly first impression or even up to our last day...Lucky we went to a wonderful Rome hotel where we felt like first class customers. I would not recommend if you want to feel like they want your business.

<Content>Better than expected! Great Location! I was a little concerned reading some of the reviews here on Trip Advisor but the hotel was definitely better than expected! We stayed for 4 nights from April 21st and Florence was busier than expected! The hotel lobby area is certainly very stylish and in the Art Nouveau style. The rooms were certainly adequately sized but the Art Nouveau theme didn't continue here, the rooms were sort of baroque styled but better than the photos show. We had a room that overlooked the small piazza at the side of the hotel which was very pleasant. It would have been nice to have a room overlooking the river and view of the Ponte Vecchio but then you would deal with more traffic noise and we didn't hear any at all at night...(walking a few miles a day and having a bottle of wine to share every night might have had something to do with sleeping well though!) Bathroom was a fair size. Both bedroom and bathroom were very clean and well stocked up.....I'm not sure why you are not allowed to use your own electrical items in your room as another reviewer pointed out (unless they had a previous fire or something)If it's one thing this hotel has got is location....right on the river front and about a minute walk (through the crowds) to the Ponte Vecchio, Florence is compact in any case and the hotel is very handy to cross over to the Oltrarno (we found some excellent restaurants there....try Mamma Gina's on Borgo San Jacopo!)The staff were very efficient and friendly. They booked a trip for us, found out whether we could take our luggage on another coach trip to Pisa (as it was out last day and we didn't want to go back to Florence unneccessarily) phoned taxis....the staff in the breakfast area were also very friendly..think they like you when they offer to get you a morning cappucino which was fantastic! Breakfast was of a good standard. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage...cold meats cheeses, breads and pastries, cereals and juices, very good choice and definitely set us up for the day.If we ever came back to Florence, I would definitely consider staying here again.

The reception staff could not have been more helfpul and courteous than they were. Breakfast room not only is lovely to look at, they served a large variety of foods and have an excellent wait staff. We sincerely did not find one employee that was not eager to help.Location is excellent and the price was very good.Would never consider staying at another hotel while visiting Florence.

<Content>Highlights + Lowlights = I'll stay somewhere else next time Location: How can you beat it? Professional postcards and photos of the Ponte Vecchio often feature Berchielli because it's THAT nearby! Centrally located if you enjoy the Oltrarno area, as well.Reception: A little frosty. They're not brimming with warmth, but they're very helpful when needed. They'll ask you for your passport if you want to use their free Internet access, so be warned.Room: Somewhat disappointing. No view, BUT we had our own sizable outdoor patio which was cool even if it overlooked only rooftops. And what's up with not being able to use electrical devices in your own room? Delusional, as we needed to keep our cell phone charged. The shower was small and abysmal, no tub except for the accidental one when the slow drain backed up the water 3 inches, interrupting one's shower to wait for the water to recede. And what's up with the 70's bathroom fixtures? Also, when in the hallway, you could hear every word said in people's rooms. If you were in your room, you could hear every word said in the hallway. It got pretty noisy sometimes.All in all: I'd probably stay somewhere else. We stayed at Hotel de la Ville last time, which was pricier and nicer than we needed, but this was pretty pricey (I thought) and didn't quite measure up, despite the location.Other places we stayed in during this trip: Hotel Quirinale in Rome (2nd time, loved it just as much! Highly recommended, though near train station  not centrally located, was close enough to Forum  other sites) and Ca dei Conti in Venice (2nd time, very cool, but nicer than we needed. Pricey and worth every euro).Other advice: If you're organizing tours yourself, invest money on offbeat tours with non-commercialized companies. I recommend ContextRome (pricey  totally worth it) and Original Walking Tours (Artviva).

<Content>Amazing location, will stay there again We stayed at the Berchielli for 5 days in late December and it was fabulous. The location is incredible and could not be more convenient. The rooms are not super deluxe but they are comfortable, clean and more than adequate. The staff was very helpful; when we asked about train schedules to Rome, the concierge booked tickets and had them delivered to the hotel for us. We'll definitely stay at the Berchielli again - it's the perfect place to stay in Florence.

<Content>Very Good Hotel - The Best Location!!! We spent a week in Italy, starting in Rome and then travelling to Florence by train. The hotel was an easy walk from the train station, right by the banks of the river Arno close to everything happening in Florence. Our room was enormous - the biggest I've stayed in so far - and had the largest double bed I've ever slept in. The decor was pleasant, though on the whole, the hotel was neither modern nor traditional. I somehow didn't feel very cosey staying there, but that didn't stop me from enjoying my stay. It doesn't have as much character as you would expect from a Florence hotel. The breakfast was very good and the waiters exceptionally attentive. Unfortunately, the reception staff were not all that nice... most of them were rather moody and nobody was willing to smile. There is a breakfast veranda which is very nice and an indoor bar which offered a wide variety of drinks. Although our stay was very pleasant, I think I'd like to explore other hotel options if I ever return to Florence.

<Content>Great- no complaints My husband and I have just returned from a European vacation which included a stay at the Berchielli. I found it to be delightful. The staff was friendly, and had made us reservations for the Uffizi and Accademia museums as we had requested. The room was much larger than we expected, as some of our other hotels on this trip had been much smaller. It was a corner room with no view on one side, but a lovely view of rooftops from the other window. The decor was a little old fashioned- but this hotel is not meant to be a big corporate hotel with bells and whistles. The bathroom was a a decent size- no complaints- though the shower was a little tricky to operate. Breakfast was adequate- nothing fancy, but was nice to grab a roll and tea.The location is great. Granted nothing is too far away as Florence is not that big, but being so close to the Ponte Vecchio and the cute shopping areas was great.I do agree with the other review that it is a bit of a walk to or from the train station with bags- but our cab was also around 8-9 Euro.Overall it was a great, clean hotel with a nice staff-I would definately reccommend it to anyone.

<Content>Good Hotel I stayed here in late November. I booked the hotel via Expedia for 5 nights, cost was ~ $715 total incl. taxes.The hotel is in a good location right on the Arno @ 200 meters from the Ponte Vecchio. Very short walk to all the attractions like the Uffizi (250 meters), Duomo (500 meters or so). Its a little too far to easily walk with luggage from the train station, but a taxi was only ~ 8 Euro including tip. The room was small for a double, it was tight for 1 person, but clean, well maintained and everything was in good condition. There was no view, only of the building next door. Breakfast was good and the hotel staff was helpful and friendly.I would recommend this hotel. Considering the price and the location, I thought it was a good choice.

They sent us to two restaurants,which were mediocre and poor value for money.The breakfast was not too bad,although I do object to tinned fruit salad.I would recommend this hotel if you need a reasonably priced hotel that is central to the art galleries etc.

<Content>Beware of credit card trick I stayed for 2 weeks on business and would rate it was an average hotel. I have stayed in many hotels worldwide and would say this as a non corporate hotel with character. Rooms were fine and large enough for me though there was an odd smell lurking near the door which I never worked out. The d茅cor was dated but was of good quality so the rooms felt better than the usual corporate chain hotels with their uniform modernity. Free internet access at night helped pass the time. Breakfast was good quality if not the vast range I usually see and had everything I wanted. The best bit of the hotel is it鈥檚 location right in the heart of things which was not much help to me as I only got out at night when most things apart from restaurants were closed. I found an excellent restaurant in Piazza Mercato Centrale called Trattoria Za Za 10/15 mins walk from hotel. Get there before 7.30/8pm or you have to queue. Good Tuscan food at a reasonable price about 30 euros a head including wine.One bug bear is the reception's trick of making you pay in your own currency, not euros, on your credit card. This adds 3% or so to the bill as the exchange rate they use is very poor though they claim it鈥檚 the credit card rate which it is but it鈥檚 a special rip off rate for the convienece of having your bill in your own currency. It鈥檚 becoming more prevailent in Europe this scam but retailers are supposed to offer you the option of paying in euros, the receptionist claimed their machine couldn鈥檛 do it! This left a sour taste on leaving as I don鈥檛 like being taken for a mug and spoiled an otherwise pleasant stay.

<Content>Not as good as everyone makes out! I have just got back from a stay in Florence which was booked for my finace's birthday. We were booked into the Berchielli. When we arrived we were shown to a double room which, in any other hotel would have been a single. The room was dark, the window looked onto another building which I reckon I could have touched if I had streached out the far enough. There was no sign of any river or the Ponte del Vecchio. I complained and we got moved to a tiwn room - hardly condusive to a romantic weekend. This room was of a better size but the decor was not 4* standard and the bathrooms were from the early '80s/late '70s. In my opinion this is a medium 3* hotel with 4* prices. The lobby is nice but the rooms do not match that. I saw two rooms and niether of them had a veiw at all - they faced walls. I saw no evidence to suggest that it overlooks the river - the entrance is not on the same street as the river, it is on a street in behind. Genreally speaking hotels in Florence seem to spend most of their cash on the lobby. I would always advise asking to see a room before sealing the deal. We moved to the Ravoli which was fantastic. Staff went out of their way to help us - the rooms were of a decent size, and we over looked a courtyard with a jacuzzi in it. The Berchielli may be regarded as being right in the middle of town but as long as you are central there is little advantage to be gained by its position. It may be near the Ponte del Vecchio but its no near the Acadamia (for 'David'). There are a great deal of hetels closer to the the Duma that I am sure must be better than this one and comparable in price. Obvioulsy some people have gone to this hotel and been delighted, which is great, but, in my opinion, be warned - see your room first and if you're not sure don't book this place - you may not get the view you expect (and if you don't make sure you ask for an alternative room) and there are others that are just as central. Florence has a great deal of better hotels - I would advise people to use them.F

<Content>Loved the hotel- hated the English guests My husband  I have recently returned from a weekend stay at this lovely hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to prospective guests. Just ensure, that you don't stay when there are a crowd of elderly English people there, stealing the contents of the breakfast buffet, and putting them into bags to be consumed later. We were almost knocked down in the stampede to get to the buffet, not for what was to be consumed on the premises, but for what had been cunningly stowed away for later. One man had even gone to the bother of making the little rolls into sandwiches. Well, as Scots, we have a reputation for being canny, I would say rather undeservedly, after this performance.

<Content>Location, Location, Location We spent 4 nights here from 1st June 2004. The lobby is very nice and might warrant the four stars. The rooms themselves were definetly of a 3 star standard, with extremely tiny bathrooms- really really cramped. I really think we had one of the smallest rooms in the hotel, as we could see rooms all around us with balconies and verandas. We had to ask for extra blankets as the air conditioning control did not seem to work. We did consider asking to move rooms, but we knew they were booked up, and as we only showered and spent so little time in the room, we let it slide. The reason this hotel can be classed as a 4 star and will get a good review, is the location.You can see the Ponte Vecchio from all angles and are literally seconds away from all the action. You can pop back to the hotel to drop off shopping, or just to freshen up. This is why the Berchielli consistantly gets good reviews on tripadvisor. The breakfasts were extremly good, with a choice of hat  cold fare, and very good coffee.When you are in a city like Florence, time is of the essence, and the pure convenience of this hotel makes it so popular- we would definetely stay here again when visiting Florence.

<Content>Hotel location excellent Stayed at Berchielli for 11 nights. Hotel location excellent for all the sights. Double room at front with terrific views of the Ponto Vecchio and Arno. Bathroom on our particular room was small. Buffet breakfast excellent with staff being very attentive. Barbara on the desk was extremely helpful. If you leave the Hotel by the door which leads onto Apostoli you find Il Boccale Ristorante which is a small eatery which is popular with locals and tourists and serves excellent food at very reasonable prices. The hotel was undergoing some refurbishment and there was no access to the roof garden because of work on the 4th floor.

<Content>Brilliant Berchielli Have just returned from a wonderful 4 day stay at the Berchielli, and cannot fault the hotel in any way. The hotel was nicely decorated and furnished, and very clean. The bathroom was well-equipped, and everything worked really well. It was so hot in Florence that we really appreciated the air-conditioning, both in the room and in the rest of the hotel. Our room had a breath-taking view over the Arno, and the hotel was really well-placed for exploring Florence. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast, with a variety of choices, and found all the staff polite and friendly. We hope to be able to return one day and would have no hesitation in recommending the Berchielli.

<Content>Men need training in manners! Overall, our stay was fantastic! Our triple room was exceptional-- 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with a courtyard view! The only complaint were the male desk clerks! The women clerks were friendly and helpful but the men were generally curt and less helpful.

<Content>Absolutely perfect location After studying the reviews for many hotels in Florence a girlfriend  I decided on the Berchielli. We were not disappointed. It is in the best vicinity for visiting MOST of the major attractions in Florence. The rooms were very comfortable, clean  nicely furnished. The bathrooms ( we had two) were excellent. We found the staff pleasant  helpful with booking day trips  restaurant recommendations. Having free internet usage was a real bonus ( they charged us at the hotel we stayed in in Rome).Breakfasts were wonderful, full range continental, pastries, fruit, cereals etc  this was included in our rate.Pre booking tickets for the major attractions eg, Uffizi, L'Accademia etc we totally recommend. It was a relief that we had done that ahead of going because those queues are something else! Overall you cannot beat the Berchielli  I would definately stay there again.

<Content>No Complaints The staff were friendly and spoke good English. Everything in the room/Hotel appeared to work. Good standard of continental breakfast. Ideal location for seeing the sights. What more can you ask for? We'd go back.

<Content>Just perfect Stayed in this hotel April 29th to May 2nd. Perfect for a short stay in Florence, rooms lovely, but slightly on small side, the bathroom was the biggest seen in any hotel nearly as big as the bedroom. Breakfast very good hot and cold buffet. Superb location,everything within walking distance and very close to the bridge. No restaurant in hotel, but did not need it as there were so many within walking distance. Florence absolutely beautiful, will most definitely go back and stay at this hotel.

<Content>Lovely This hotel was very pleasant, and well situated near the centre of Florence. The intensive air con. was a relief from the hot Tuscan summer! The rooms were well appointed, the television a little old - but with a good selection of channels. The interiors were classy, but understated, and the cleaning service very good, and unobtrusive. The bathroom was large and had designer Etro toiletries. The hotel enabled us to relax and enjoy Florence. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfasts were fine.

<Content>Hotel Berchielli - you need look no further! Most people visiting Florence or 'doing' Italy tend to stay in the city for a few nights which is exactly what my wife and I did.Travelling via British Airways, flying to Pisa from LGW, BA gave us a wide range of excellent hotels to choose from. We went for the Berchielli because it had good reviews, was 'endorsed' by BA, has a really superb central location alongside the Arno and is reasonably priced for a 4* hotel.We were not disappointed. There's a great self service buffet breakfast - juices, croissants, Danish, fruit, yogurts, cereal, bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages, salamis, cheeses, jams...etc, etc. And what's more, the coffee is brilliant. It really is central, just 100m or so from Ponte Vecchio and right alongside the Arno. The hotel's location is fantastic and I promise you won't be disappointed either. We walked everywhere - Florence is a very 'walkable' city. The Berchielli is only a few minutes from the Uffizi, the Academia, Piazze della Signoria and it took us just 15 minutes to walk to San Lorenzo market and church. Our room (108) on the first floor (because my wife hates elevators) looked out onto the river Arno, the Ponte Vecchio to the left and the Ponte Sante Trinita to the right. The cluster of buildings growing up out of the river bank were intriguing, dominated by the dome and spire of Santo Spirito church. We did experience slight traffic noise first thing in the morning around 7.30. But it acted as a good alarm clock for us and only coincided with the Firenze rush-hour. The double glazing coped very well, and the buzz of Lambrettas Fiats and Alfas was not a problem! (We are used to living in the country with no major roads or busy streets, so we probably notice traffic noise more than most).Immediately adjacent to the hotel's very calm and peaceful courtyard entrance is the little church of Santa Apostoli, where a plaque claims it was founded by Charlemagne. Some people prefer a courtyard facing room as they believe it's quieter. OK, maybe it is a bit quieter, but then you're in a city and church bells are quite noisy too! Our room was very comfortable, clean, bright and airy. Decor and furnishings better than expected plus air conditioning/heating, private fridge/bar and a bathroom that would have done a 5* establishment proud. We were surprised, given we had a 5 night stay, that our sheets and towels were changed daily - a bit of a waste really.Apart from the breakfast room facility, the hotel does not have a restaurant - but don't worry - there are dozens of restaurants to choose from within a few minutes walk. The hotel does have a very freindly and cosy bar where we had a few glasses of a satisfying house Toscana - just ask for vino rossi and you won't go wrong! Immediately alogside the bar is the reception area where you can use the internet FOC - very useful if you need to keep in touch with the office.After 5 nights, we had to return home having seen just some of the treasures Florence has to offer. We will return soon and we will stay at the Berchielli again, even if I win the lottery!If you want big brash, international and luxurious, I suggest you go the The Savoy or Helvetia and Bristol.If you want comfort, intimacy, friendliness and excellent location at a reasonable cost, stay at the Berchielli and check out BA's offers.Please feel free to e-mail me if you want more info either about the hotel or Florence in general.Best wishesjrinjersey@hotmail.com
