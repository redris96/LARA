<Content>Nice  We stayed at this hotel in November 2008. We had a twin room that was quite spacious and everything that you would expect from an average 4 star. Beds were very comfortable and the hotel was very quiet both inside and out. Alexanderplatz was an easy 10 minute walk away so we thought location good. Even better was that there was a U-Bahn staiton right outside the hotel so if you were travelling across the city it was dead easy. I have to say that although my room was spacious, some friends paid exactly the same but their room was somewhat smaller. The only downside was breakfast @ 13euro pp I thought it was expensive and not really worth the money however if I was to visit Berlin again (although I won't) I would stay there again/

<Content>Over-rated Booked this hotel through a recommendation, but was pretty disappointed. Location wasn't amazing (slightly puzzled by previous reviews!), and for the cost I could easily have booked a more stylish, better quality hotel. Having said that it was only 10 mins walk to Alexanderplatz and plenty going on up there!Although it was nice, it felt as though everything was done on the cheap, and that they were trying to claw every penny out of guests; wifi and hotel meals v expensive. Staff, whilst friendly and helpful didn't seem particularly organised, and there was confusion with staff trying to charge us 32euros for a couple of croissants and make us pay twice for the room!At all in all, OK but could do much better!

<Content>Stylish, Spacious  Our perfect hotel is one that offers a central location to the attractions we want to see - with spacious, comfortable rooms and good service.art'otel, Mitte in Berlin definitely fulfilled these requirements.Our room (superior double) was very spacious and extremely comfortable - with a bath for relaxing those tired walking muscles. The onsite restuarant was also excellent - supported by good advice on local eating establishments when we wanted to venture out.The Hotel is less than 1/2 block from the closest U Bhan station - but is situated in a quiet street. Walking time to many sights (Unter den Linden, Gendarmenmakt, Deutches Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Nikolaivertel etc. was less than 15 minutes - while virtually everything else was easily accessible by U-Bahn, starting almost next door.

<Content>superb, comfortable hotel! Initially we were apprehensive about booking with a 鈥渂outique-style鈥?hotel, being a semi retired couple in our mid 50鈥檚, but the price and location were ideal for our purposes.Upon arrival we were greeted by a young male receptionist who immediately made us feel at home. Being early evening, we were concerned at finding a nearby restaurant for our meal. He immediately supplied us with maps indicating the most suitable areas for a choice of restaurants and the type of cuisine to be expected.The hotel is modern and functional. Although the facilities may initially appear to be simplistic, nothing is omitted and the beds were some of the most comfortable experienced.I would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly stay again should I revisit Berlin.

<Content>classy city hotel This city hotel is in a good location. Restaurants not far, lots to see and do. The hotel itself is very nice, clean, minimalist and our room was very nice. The rooms are colour themed and you can request a colour! We were more interested in requesting a balcony room, however, as it was August and we wanted to spend a couple of evenings with a beer outside. The hotel accommodated us for this. The staff on reception were also very helpful in giving us information about restaurants and also telling us that some closed at certain times, thereby saving us a walk. It's worth asking them, as they were all very knowledgeable about the area.We had a lovely few days here - Berlin was great and we really recommend this hotel for a city break.

<Content>Just OK I'm way back with this review! I stayed for 3 days at the art'otel berlin-mitte in early May, in a working trip. My overall feelings about the hotel are positive, though I would have expected something special from a 'boutique' hotel. ROOM: My room was good sized, the bathroom was ok with a nice shower and a great hair drier (I have long hair and it was pouring rain while I was there, so it became quite useful). Even though the room had a big window, the view was... a wall! Of course I wasn't to stay at my room all day but it was deceiving to face a wall first thing in the morning. Details were really what most bothered me: shutters had little holes, the shower had a broken tile and curtains looked a bit tired. Again, nothing really important except that I had supposedly paid for a 'design' hotel.  HOTEL/STAFF: The architecture of building is quite nice. The breakfast room is beautiful, with lots of light and a nice decoration (the breakfast itself is once again just ok - even a bit overpriced if not for the great service). The staff was very attentive, they all spoke very good english and were very efficient.AREA: When I booked the hotel, I had the idea it was a little more central than it ended up being (it was my first time in Berlin) but there's a metro station right out the hotel, as well as bus stops (that I've never used). The area is very calm, mostly residential. Getting back in the evening by myself was weird, the street would be dark and desert - but I never felt unsafe in any way.As said before, I didn't disliked the hotel. It's just nothing special for the price.

<Content>Great Location for UBahn, Good value with a deal The hotel is located 50m from a UBahn station which makes up for the fact there are not a lot of bars etc in the immediate vicinity. We found it very easy to go a few stops on the UBahn to a more lively area especially as the U2 line runs until 12:45 on weekdays and 0300 on a Saturday night. There is a corner shop 50m away for drinks etc at a fraction of the minibar rates. Australians may find it useful to note that the hotel is next door to the Australian Embassy and there is also an Australian shop a few doors a way.The hotel itself was of a good standard without being too over the top. One very useful feature we dont get in the UK much at this budget was aircon which was vital bearing in mind the windows could not be opened due to mosquitos from the nearby river. The only negative point was the bathroom which did not have enough ventilation leading to an equatorial feel for an hour after someone had showered. The shower was also badly designed so that it flooded the bathroom floor no matter how the curtain was positioned. The overall standard was very similar to a uk Travelinn. We got a deal and paid around 拢60 per night which was good value.We didnt eat at the hotel as the menus looked very expensive and we preferred to eat on the go whilst sightseeing. We found it is best to shop around as there is widely varying value for food in Berlin.The best way to travel around the city is to get the 3 day welcome card. Our advice is to get the ticket from a machine which speaks english as there are a number of similar but different tickets and it is easy to get the wrong one from a non-english speaking advisor in a station info centre. You can then pick up the voucher book from a station info centre when passing. Make sure you get the right type of info centre though as we queued at several (There seems to be seperate ones for the UBahn SBahn and normal trains) getting blank looks before finding the right one (the SBahn). Obviously the best thing is to make the effort to learn some German!!

<Content>Very disappointing Having previously enjoyed a great week's stay at the sister art'otel in Berlin (the Warhol-themed City Centre West), we decided to book a 4-night stay at this hotel so we could visit more of the sights on the eastern side of the city.The difference was stark. This hotel is located in a very quiet district - barely a passing car on a weekday, completely dead at the weekendand with no local facilities. The one bar round the corner had one old pensioner propping the bar up on a Friday evening.The hotel itself is already showing signs of age. The fixtures and fittings in the room were tired and worn; edges of shelves worn away, carpets badly stained, window blinds torn and damaged.The room was very much smaller than in the sister hotel, though the bed was amply sized as in all German hotels. Only one almost useless pillow per person though (think no thicker than a cracker) and no availability of additional bed linen as most other hotels would normally provide. The room was effectively air conditioned (i.e. you could control temperature and speed yourself) and this is essential as the hotel's proximity to a very still tributary to the Spree means that the area is plagued by large, voracious mosquitoes. Leaving your bedroom window open is not an option as my heavily bitten body will testify!During my stay I needed to use the internet in order to check-in for our return flight. The cost of using the solitary PC in the lobby was extortionate. Given the low cost of internet access and PC hardware, all decent hotels now offer such 'business centre' services for free - here, it was a credit card driven system charging 1Euro for 3 minutes online time and extra for every printed page. As a general tip, if you need to use the internet whilst in Berlin, look up the Easy Internet cafes before you go, there's a huge one in Kurfurstendam and at least one more I saw elsewhere - there access costs 1 Euro for an hour!Overall, the stay at Berlin Mitte was not what I expected from a hotel chain which calls its most basic room 'Superior'. It needs to decide whether it wants to be 'designer' or just a smart hostel. For UK travellers, the room was the same size and in the same condition as you'd find in a Travelodge. If you expect no more than that, you won't be disappointed. Also, if you're the kind of person who likes to step out of their hotel and straight into the action, this won't ring your bell as all destinations will require at least a half hour walk or public transport journey.

<Content>Decent hotel, good location, poor bathroom design Stayed here on a priceline rate of about $70/night so I cannot complain too much. The hotel is relatively convenient when arriving by train, though you generally have to switch lines to get here. Luckily the hotel is very close to a U Bahn line so its easy to get around. Check-in was fine and the staff spoke pretty good English. Hallways and public areas were decorated nicely, albeit perhaps a bit unique. The room was small, but fine for a two night stay. Wished the beds would have been a bit more substantial, but my worst complaint is on the bathroom. There was no lip to the shower so the water ran into the bathroom as well, since it was just separated by a relatively thin curtain. This could have just been our room but my guess is its relatively common in the design. I would stay here again, but only if on a budget.

<Content>Style and great value Stayed two nights here in a very spacious double room with an extra bed for our 15-year-old son. Loved the designer feel of the hotel. Some excellent touches in the bedroom, such as complimentary mineral water and an espresso coffee machine; staff were exceptionally helpful (a receptionist came up to show us how to operate the coffee machine!). Got a good deal by booking direct with the hotel, and although the breakfast was not included it was well worth the extra 15 euros and was one of the best buffet breakfasts we have ever experienced. Only minor gripe was that the plumbing needed some attention - hot water continued to enter from the bath tap while the shower was in use, and the basin was not securely fixed.

<Content>Damning with Faint Praise We were attracted to the hotel because of its design, and as far as the restaurant, bar, breakfast went - it was lovely. But the design in the bathrooms - not lovely. First we stayed in a smallish room with an impossible to adjust shower. Then we upgraded to a bigger and better room where the faucets were so poorly placed that even washing your hands was uncomfortable. In the budget room there was no shampoo in the bathroom - you had to go downstairs to ask for it, and the information regarding hotel services had been copied on a copier which was obviously running out of ink. The hotel is part of the Park Plaza chain, and yet the bathrooms and instructions made you feel like you were staying in a youth hostel. The great breakfastnearly made up for it, but... you can find better in Berlin. As for location, yes, it is directly across from a subway station, but so are lots of hotels and this one isn't part of a busy line - you can wait for that subway for a long time... We won't be back.

<Content>Great City, good hotel, perfect location We stayed for one night, Saturday, for a Valentines get away.The Hotel is in a nice quiet street, it is clean, well presented with helpful, friendly staff who spoke very good english. We did not try the food.The location is perfect, the U Bahn is outside with single trips for 1.20 Euro. We walked easliy to Checkpoint Charlie, then Potzdammer platz and Brandenburg Gate. Alexanderplatz and a section of old town are nearby with some excellent drinking and eating venues.We would go back for a longer stay if in Berlin again.

The u-bahn will also take you easily to the Stadtmitte (a short walk to checkpoint charlie) or Potzdamer Platz for the holocaust museum.The hotel is modern, d茅cor spartan but functional. Staff very friendly and helpful, the rooms more than adequate.

<Content>Great value hotel, great location. This hotel was easy to find, in a great location next to the U-bahn, was clean, safe and quiet, and was great value.The rooms were a good size, while not being large, which we pretty much expected and the staff friendly. Have to say though, the rooms are a good size by London standards.The hotel is only a short walk from Museum Island and is on the U2 underground line (U-bahn). To get there from Schonefeld airport, simply catch the S9 (surface train) from the airport and get off at Alexanderplatz, then change to the U2 line heading towards Ruhleben and get off after two stops at Museum Markt. You will see the hotel when you get up the stairs. The U2 goes to many locations and is safe to use well into the night. Cost for 2 hour AB zone ticket is 2.10 euro, which you can also use from the airport, (makes trip to the hotel great value). There after, we bought a day ticket (AB zone again) for 5.60 euro each, which allowed us to get on and off the U-bahn and S-bahn all day without worrying about tickets. (don't forget to validate your ticket in yellow 'box' after buying it).At the end of the street is a deli run by a nice couple who make takeaway latte's for 2 euro and have nice pastries for about 1.60 each. We had these for breakfast in our room before heading out for the day.

<Content>Dodgy bed Just got back from a weekend at this hotel. The location is excellent; quiet street with the U-bahn entrance just 50 metres away (two stops from Alexanderplatz hub). Staff were genuinely friendly. Basic room was quite small and the bed was a sprung matress - very uncomfortable - far too soft. There was a helpful warning about mosquitoes by the window though and as they tend to be fond of my blood this was a handy tip.So.... breakfast 8/10, location 8/10, bed 1/10 - my poor neck!

<Content>Great Room, Mediocre Value! My partner  I stayed here for 3 nights on our recent month-long trip around Europe. We arrived at the hotel in the evening  were checked in without any hassles. We thought it was in a bit of a commercial-type area, without any local shops as such, but it was within seconds of the metro,  within easy distance of many attractions around Berlin.Our room was fairly large with huge double-glazed windows looking out onto the street. The air conditioning was provided at no extra change,  the beds (two singles pushed together to make a king) were very comfortable. There was a mini-bar, TV two desks, a wardrobe  a counter for your baggage. The bathroom was large-ish, with a wheelchair friendly shower. It was all quite nice, if a little anaemic. It seemed more like a business-orientated hotel, although the staff did their best to help us with directions  the like. The restaurant  bar were a bit pricey, but there was a cool 'outdoor bar' - an indoor area without a roof, so you could actually sit in the sun - see it to believe it. There was also an internet computer in the lobby but you can only access it by using your credit card details.We scored this room through a website that was offering cheap rooms at the time (I guess empty rooms don't make money) - while I thought we received exceptional value for money (we had a superior room too  it was still ridiculously cheap), when we saw the price that the room usually was, we just about died of shock - I cannot imagine paying that much for what it was, although I am sure that we would have stuck to budget rather than location if that had been the case.We enjoyed our stay there a lot, but it would have been nice if breakfast was included (you could buy it separately but it was also pricey). Recommended for those with a high budget unless you can get a deal!

<Content>Reasonably Priced but Stylish This hotel was extremely clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. My room was average sized for European standards. The shower was quite small and there was no bathtub. Internet access here was very expensive: 25 Euros per 24 hours. The front desk staff was always willing to provide excellent tourist advice and maps. The art theme of the hotel added a stylish touch to a very reasonably priced hotel. A subway station was directly in front of the hotel, providing easy access to city sights as well as Tegel Airport. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would recommend the hotel to others.

<Content>Stylish with a great location This is a good contemporary hotel with basic, but comfortable accommodation. We had a clean room facing the inner courtyard which was quiet at night. The room was painted white with white voiles and blinds, a yellow leather armchair, and a bathroom with a shower and a stainless steel sink set into a bright orange worktop. A couple of large lithographs were the only decoration. The only downside to the room was the lack of adequate storage space - a small wardrobe and a shelf, but no drawers. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Breakfasts were superb - the dining room is set in an attractive glass-roofed atrium with leather chairs. A large choice of cooked breakfasts, smoked salmon, patisserie, cereals, yoghourts, fresh fruit salad with strawberries, coffee and teas etc. This provided an excellent start to the day. The cost for this is extra but, considering the choice and quality, it was good value for money.In addition, the hotel is very close to a U-bahn stop on one side and a pretty canal (an offshoot of the Spree) on the other. I would be happy to stay here again.

<Content>Quiet Neighborhood..Convenient to U-bahn We stayed her for two nights in April 2006. As others have mentioned, there isn't much happening around this hotel day or night, but everything in Berlin is easily reachable using public transportation. The U-bahn stop M盲rkisches Museum on the U2 line is literally right under the street (Wallstrasse) outside the hotel with easy connections a couple stops away at Alexander Platz to other U and S-bahn lines you can use to explore the city. Traveling the other direction (toward Ruhleben) will allow you to visit Checkpoint Charlie (Stadmitte station) and Potzdamer Platz where you can also connect to the S-bahn and further on is the Olympic Stadium.Our room was spacious (for Europe) and the bathroom was very nice. Two twin beds could be combined to make a king bed and the window opened for some fresh air. Everything looked rather new. The hallway lights are operated by motion, which was a bit startling when we left early in the morning to catch our flight. We had to wave our arms out the door to get the lights to come on.We flew into Berlin-Sch枚nefeld and purchased a 2 day pass for all trains for around 15 Euro. We took the S-bahn to Alexanderplatz and transferred to the U-bahn to reach the hotel. We definitely got our money's worth using the 2 day pass as we explored Berlin extensively taking in Checkpoint Charlie, the Olympic Stadium, the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, the East Side Gallery, the Ku'damm, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged盲chtnis-Kirche, Berliner Dom, the Fernsehturm, and Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Oranienburg (reachable via the S1) among others. All of the sites we saw with the exception of Sachsenhausen are in the A or B zone, but if you want to visit further out make sure you get an ABC ticket. It is only a Euro or two more to do this if you do it up front.We ate at the hotel restaurant one night when we were just too tired to find anything else. It was a pleasant experience and the food was excellent. English language menus were available and the atmosphere is quite nice. For other meals we ate near Alexander Platz at a Brewpub and also several times at Hackescher Markt (Hackescher Hof has great breakfasts and there is an American type restaurant that even sold nachos connected to the S-bahn station), reachable by several S-bahn lines from Alexander Platz. You can even find the biggest Starbucks I've ever seen there if you can't go without your daily dose.About the only problem we experienced at the Art'Otel was that the internet wi-fi was down as was the internet from the computer in the lobby (both are pay services). Since we had planned to phone home using Skype, this threw a wrench in our plans but I understood it to be more of an issue of the internet provider than of the hotel itself.I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it if you don't want to spend the big bucks for something near the more popular parts of the city. Since you can get there easily using public transport, save your money for some beer!!

<Content>Good location, but... We spent two nights at the Art 'otel in Berlin Mitte last weekend. We found this hotel to be overpriced. Breakfast was 14 Euro, which would have been nice if it were included in the price of the room. There was nothing really special about this hotel. Be prepared to walk through a cloud of smoke every time you arrive and depart the hotel. I live in Germany and expect the smoke, but this was a little ridiculous. The location was great as we took public transportation everywhere and the UBahn was right outside the hotel. The room was clean and the personnel were very friendly. There was a convention in Berlin so the hotels all over Berlin were completely booked. Only in this situation would I consider staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Not what I expected but not bad value Beware self-proclaimed 'hip boutique' hotels with slick websites. Art'otel is a relatively basic hotel masquerading as a luxury/trendy one. On the plus side, the lobby and restaurant areas are very well designed and pleasant areas to hang out in: the breakfast buffet is also quite good. On the minus side, the rooms are quite small and basic and beginning to fade a little too quickly for a relatively new hotel. I stayed in a junior suite, which was just about the size of an average hotel room for a four star, and was perfectly adequate, but nothing special.The hotel's main selling point is its excellent location, within easy and pleasant walking distance of the sights of Mitte and with a beautifully restored early 20th C. U-Bahn station (subway) just outside the door. They also offer relatively good weekend deals, so let's not be too negative!

<Content>Disappointing with a good location Spent 3 nights recently at the Artotel Berlin Mitte. It was supposed to be a designer hotel, I have searched for the design, but I haven't found any kind of design in the rooms. May be the restaurant have something, but the rooms are poorly decorated, with common furniture. The bed was not very comfortable. In the bathroom there is only liquid soap with two small towels. Do not expect any kind of luxury at Artotel Berlin Mitte, it is only a basic hotel, but with a convenient location (50 meters from the metro, 2 metro stations from Alexander platz).The breakfast was good and the staff friendly.

<Content>Too Fabulous For Its Own Good Directly across the street from an informal bus terminus the hotel is also very convenient for the U-Bahn into town and some points in the East on foot, but quite a walk away from the heart of things.The staff was friendly and tried to be accomodating, but couldn't give me a non-smoking room for the first night, nor an internal room, and I was woken by the early morning firing up of the local bus service (a courtyard-facing room is essential unless you have industrial strength earplugs.)The rooms are small and ill-conceived. Too much attention on 'fabulousness' throughout the hotel (the public spaces are sleek and unwelcoming) and not enough on basic guest comfort.

<Content>Probably Not Your Best Choice Our first trip to Berlin, so we were unfamiliar with the city layout. But we were drawn to the design of the Art'otel. Yes, the public spaces are nicely designed, as are the rooms. But the rooms are small and not very functional. And the location is definitely out of the way (although there is an U-bahn station just a half block away). And we were really put off by the tourist buses and groups. Not really our scene. If you do end up here, be sure to specify a room at the back of the hotel. The ones on the front are very noisy.

<Content>Needs a bit of work done We spent two nights in the Art'Otel Ermelerhaus in April 2003. The design of the place is great, but whilst the common areas were spotless, the room had definitely seen some wear and tear. The walls looked like the hadn't been painted for a few years, and the shower wasn't working properly. Also not the cleanest room I have seen. On a more positive note, the breakfast was sublime and the breakfast room had a lovely atmosphere. All in all not a bad place to stay, and the price was very reasonable at EUR 115 per night for a double with breakfast.
