<Content>peaceful haven near centre of Beijing Thanks to BA technical problems we were 24 hours late to Beijing so missed a night in this great littel guesthouse-just two courtyards with rooms round. You can sit out and see the sky-no high rise in sight. The littel restaurnat will open if you want it to, but you can walk to local restaurants. teh rooms are lovely-old fashioned, big wardrobe, bath rooms in silk. A haven of peace in abusy ciry-twenty minutes from the Big Square , and two minutes from a little shop where you can signal for a cold beer and take it back to your chair to sit outside your room.

<Content>a tarted up youth hostel Unfortunately the HAOYUAN didn't live up to it's hype. * I was looking forward to a scenic hutong setting - in fact it is located in a non descript side road, opposite a building site.  * At reception, when requesting the use of a WC (our room wasn't ready and we had just come from Xian on the overnight train) I was shown to a dirty hole in the floor toilet - not a good start !*|Our room and bathroom were fine but when you are paying 150 pounds sterling a night - so it should be !! The problem was IT WAS COLD we had to sleep in our clothes and, despite asking each day, a radiator wasn't supplied until the third day*The breakfast room was little more than a dingy caff with a VERY limited breakfast which included orange SQUASH. we only ate breakfast on the first day.If the rooms were all 70/80 pounds a night I would say it wasan acceptable guest house but when they are charging 150 pounds a night expectations are raised and they were certainly not met A disappointed customer

<Content>Peace of mind Visited Haoyuan late april and stayed for four nights. I had a standard room in the outer yard fully furnished in traditional Chinese style complete with very comfortable beds with silk beddings. Modcons consisted of a TV - only national channels and a modern bathroom which was very nice.The outer yard lent it's magic with some 40 red lanterns lit up in the evening and presented a serene place to collect your thoughts and feelings after a long day out on the city. Although right near the city centre I felt removed from the hustle and bustle once I entered the gateway into the yard.The location is great, about 5 minutes from Wangfujing and within walking distance to the forbidden palace and Tianmen square.The resturant serves well-priced dishes of the local cousine and was well worth a visit.All in all a very nice hotel, well-spoken english staff and a tremendous atmosphere really highlighting my stay.

<Content>Wonderful stay, recommended! Stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of April. It was overall the best place we stayed in our 2 week holiday despite the place being in the midst of renovations. We initially booked an upgraded room at the back courtyard however on arrival the staff apologised saying their renovations were not yet finalised in that area and although we could stay in the suites we would endure some noise from the builders. So we decided to stay in one of the standard rooms located in the very nice front courtyard. The refurb in these rooms had just been completed so our room had a sparkling shower room and was beautifully furnished plus the mattresses were perfect. I thought it would be noisy but either the builders were very quiet or they didn't start until a bit later. We were only woken up one night by one of the guests banging on our neighbour's door but aside from that its a very peaceful location. Overall a great authentic place to stay, english speaking staff, close to shopping area and next to metro station - I would definitely return.

<Content>Terrific alternative to the high rises Wonderful little hotel - we had a room in the back courtyard and it was truly lovely. Close to the subway - so we had no problems getting around. The included breakfast was delicious and the staff was very courteous and helpful. The only reason I give a 4 instead of a 5 is that we were a bit chilly - an extra blanket solved the problem, but even though the room was heated, not an ideal spot in winter, I'd say.

<Content>Wonderful I have stayed here twice this year. It may not have flash bars or restaurants but it does have tremendous charm and character with extremely helpful and courteous staff. I highly recommend this hotel and in particular room 24.The adventurous should also consider hiring a bicycle to explore the real Beijing.Stephen LeonardBermuda

<Content>"Real" China Hotel This is a wonderful courtyard hotel, operated by Chinese locals. Of our 5 hotel stays during our 3-week visit to China, this was hands down our favorite. Charming, very clean and with lots of local character. The hotel is located near the downtown shopping and tourist area, about a 15 minute walk from the main shopping street, close to the Peninsula and Novotel hotels. It is on the edge of a working hutong. A bicycle repairman is just down the street and it's next door to the neighborhood school.  Rooms are decorated in traditional chinese furniture and clustered around 2 courtyards. The second, inside courtyard is the most charming, with fish bowls scattered about and bird cages hung in the trees.While the staff is not perfect in English, they are hard-working and go the extra mile to help guests with all questions. The manager arranges tours to the Great Wall. Several guests gave them high marks.In addition to the charm of the hotel, a great plus for staying there is the other guests it attracts. Because it is small, relatively affordable and a bit different, it attracts guests who are also interesting. During our stay, we shared beers every afternoon in the courtyard with delightful new friends from Australia, New Zealand, California, Colorado and Germany. Quite a cross section of experiences and adventures.We went on to stay in several of the top 5 star hotels in Beijing, Xian and Shanghai. None of them was half as much fun or as interesting as the Haoyuan Hotel.

<Content>Great start to our visit in China Stayed for four nights at the hotel in mid-May and thoroughly enjoyed it. We stayed in a standard Chinese room and it was fully fitted out with everything we needed. Cab from the airport was about 45 minutes and 80RMB.The courtyard was peaceful at night, the breakfast was great in the morning and the staff were always very helpful when we had requests of them (like when we were leaving and asked them to call a taxi - to our surprise, one of the girls behind the desk took off and ran in her high heels down the block to the adjacent main street to get the cab for us!)We ate dinner here our first night in Beijing and it was very good, although just a little more expensive than the restaurants on the adjacent main street.The hotel was about a 15 minute walk to the nearest subway, 15 minutes to Wangfujing and about 35-45 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden city. If ever in Beijing again I would definitely stay at the Haoyuan Binguan.Note - I found that after booking our hotels directly in China, it was handy to go to some of the on-line Chinese travel agencies, lookup the hotel I was staying at and print out their map and Chinese address and directions to the hotel. Made communicating with the cab drivers very easy.

<Content>Far from everything! My friends were staying at the Travelers Hotel in Beijing, but I was unable to find a reasonably priced alternative until I came across this Hotel. While the rooms were fine - (I wouldn't recommend this place in the winter - it was pretty drafty), there was no restaurant. This hotel is not close to anything - it was a long cab ride to every thing. And, worst of all, taxi drivers couldn't find the place - even with the address card. I carried a cell phone and had taxi drivers get driving instructions from the hotel front desk. The location of this Hotel is in a hutong, but one that is in need of some gentrification - you will not feel comfortable walking alone at night here. The front desk got me Beijing opera tickets and that was great. They also got me a tour of the Great Wall, which turned out to be me and a driver who spoke no English. The hotel itself isn't bad, but the inconveniences of getting there and eating making this not a first choice.

<Content>Outstanding This hotel is beautiful. Wonderful classical Chinese furniture and the friendliest hotel staff I have ever encountered. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. The hot water is a bit slow, but that was the only problem. Obviously due to its converted-courtyard-house nature this hotel is far more suitable for a romantic holiday than a business stay!

<Content>nice small family hotel we were staying in this hotel for 6 nights in a suite and were very pleased with our accommodation. it has a cozy athmosphere and we liked very much the location because you could walk to some of the attractions or take a taxi.it would have been nice if the internet would have been included but still, the rates were very inexpensive.the breakfast had a nice variety and the staff was courteous.one incident: we tried to go to Tianjan and wanted to go by train. We tried at the front desk to find out about the train times and they told us every 15 minutes is a train. please make sure when you get the information that they call the train station. It turned out that we took an afternoon train and then they told us the last train is at 4pm so we had to hire a taxi to bring us back to Beijing.So, conciergewise they are not good but everything else made up for it.

<Content>Value, location, a unique experience in a beautiful hotel A gorgeous hotel in the old courtyard style (why would you stay in a faceless generic hotel where you could be in any city in the world?) with generous rooms (we stayed in the hilariously titled 'chinese theme' room. The location is perfect - right next to 2 great cheap food options - the dumplings 3 doors down were the best we ate in china (for about 80 australian cents) and the hutongs nearby all had great food as well. 10 mins walk to the fobidden city  tiannamen, right on a long shopping strip and yet really quiet and peaceful - we only wish we'd had more time here! Don't keep hunting around for a better hotel, you won't find it, just book it now  enjoy, as we did!

<Content>Quiet, tradiitonal hotel We had 2 rooms at the Haoyuan, #12 and #14 which are connected by a small living room. Our room #14 was appointed with traditional furniture. Everything was nice and fairly clean. But the lighting in our room was poor, making it more susceptible to mosquitos. But we used our mosquito net in our bed and didn't find the mosquito zapping machine until our last day. Beds and linens were comfortable and cozy; though everything seemed to be a little used or old. our bathroom was also prone to mosquitos and didn't have the best water pressure. it also had a weird smell; don't know if it was the mildew or something else. it may sound bad from what I've written so far, but overall it was a comfortable 3 nights.we enjoyed the little complimentary breakfast every morning; and yes it was repetitive but we thought everything was tasty. we did try the novotel buffet mentioned earlier, which was fantastic, but Haoyuan did just fine as a free meal.The front desk people were also good at writing down names of places in chinese to show taxi drivers. Their english wasn't really great, but it seemed like no one in china spoke very good english. the hotel was on a quiet street, and was very relaxing at night since no street noise could be heard (at least in the front courtyard). there was also wireless internet access which was surprising. I believe they also had computers for you to use but it cost money. So if you have a laptop with wireless, feel free to bring it with you and get free internet. The hotel also let us leave a lot of baggage with them for 3 days while we went to xi'an. when we returned, we were hoping to get a room for a couple hours to shower before our flight out of china, but they were fully booked. but they let us sit in the front desk area and repack all our luggages.overall, a good, quiet time. definitely not your typical western hotel, but a interesting experience nonetheless. don't go here if you're looking to be pampered; but do go if you'd like a nice place to stay and get away from the hustle of beijing.

<Content>A hotel with character After reading some of the reviews on here I was a bit worried about our choice of hotel in Beijing. However when we arrived at the hotel I found it a lovely little hotel with lots of character in a traditional hutong. Its not luxiourious and if that is what you are after then don't stay here, but if you want to stay somewhere with character then book!The standard rooms are small but immaculately clean, furnished with ming furniture and silk bed covers, that really it give it some character. Our bathroom was tiny and could probably do with a refurb, but other than that I really enjoyed staying in this hotel for three nights. We had two twin beds in our room, TV, slippers, additional toiletries, you get tea making facilities in the room and a hair dryer which I wasn't expecting since I had brought my own. If you want a bigger room you can book the deluxe rooms, you can view all the rooms on their website and choose.The courtyard when lit up at night is spectacular and I enjoyed sitting out there in the evening absorbing the ambiance of it all.The location is perfect its so close to all the main shopping areas especially Wangfujing which was only a 10 minute walk away. Its close to the Peninsula Hotel should you want to pop in for food or a foot massage. At the end of the street is a shop where you can buy water or drinks and the main road has lots of clothes shop right the way down to the Lamma Temple.You do have trouble explaining to taxi drivers where this hotel is. But if you take the handy card written in chinese provided by the hotel with you and show this to the taxi drivers they usually know where to bring you back at very little cost.Staff are friendly and helpful, we never experienced any problems with them. Breakfast was ok not a huge choice but the basics are all there. They even make your toast for you! I think that this is a very good 3* hotel (maybe not a 4) and if you come to China why not stay in a traditional courtyard hotel and feel like your holiday in China!

<Content>A pleasant experience We just returned from a 5 day stay at the Haoyuan and I have to agree with travelers who loved the ambiance (which is why we chose the hotel) It was very charming and we loved staying in a hutong. The decor was lovely and had the feel of old China. The water situation was fine, keeping in mind it was very hot outside and we didn't need very hot water. The master bed in #12 was very comfortable, however our son stayed in the twin bed in the room and said it was a bit hard. The staff was English literate and very helpful. There was a booking mix up and they had us checking out a day before we were supposed to. The manager arranged another hotel (we opted for a regular highrise since it was our last night) and they transported our luggage.OK, there was a bit of mold in the shower but given the heat and high humidity it was to be expected. Certainly not enough to cause any distress and almost expected in an older hotel (think Florida in the summer)The room itself was very clean.The area is very convenient to walk to sights and tours can be arranged by the staff. Don't miss the hutong by bicycle tour, it was fascinating.For as many people that live in Beijing, I felt it was a very safe place for tourists and we were out way past dark. They do close the main gate at 11 but there is a buzzer and someone will let you in with your room key in hand.Breakfast is repetative but good.This was a great way to get the feel of China, I would stay again.If you decide to eat other than Chinese Food (or want a break) do not miss the buffet at the Square restaurant at the Novotel Hotel (within walking distance)M JohnsTucson, Az.

<Content>My Experience at Haoyuan I stayed at the Haoyuan in mid-May 2006. This was a nice small hotel, set in a hutong, and with traditional furnishings. You can view which room you want on their web site (mine was #27) and go from basic to fairly pricey. My room ran in mid 80s and was furnished in traditional style. The location is east of Wangfujing and Tiannamen. I like to walk and was surprised at the numer of places I could get just walking. Price included breakfast which was good, but repetitive. I was able to arrange transportation and day tours at reasonable rates and the staff had reasonable to good communication skills. I felt safe which was important given this was my first trip to China. Number of eating establishments nearby as well as a Bank of China. A point that some people complain about in Chinese hotels, hard beds, was not a problem. My bed was firm, but not uncomfortable. I would consider staying here again, but if prices creep up it gets dangeroulsy close to what you can get for better facilities at the Crown Plaza.

<Content>Personalized toast We stayed at the hotel in late March. We found the room (in the front courtyard) to be very quiet, as the area is very quiet, being off of any main streets.The single beds were managable.The lighting was poor (red lamps don't give off much reading light).Hot water was a hit-and-miss proposition. Several days, there was none, but rest of week was fine.Breakfast included. I found it fascinating that there was a young woman who watched over the toaster, turning the pieces to make sure they were golden brown, and then delivering to our table.You may use taxis to get around, or do as we did and take the bus or walk to the metro line (1 km?), which gets you around the city pretty well. We found the metro easy to use and inexpensive. And certainly not as crowded as the buses!All in all, I'd return there, if paying my own way. Reasonable price.
