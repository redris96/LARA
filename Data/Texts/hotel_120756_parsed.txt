<Content>Find another place This was my second time staying here this year. I should have leaned the first time.Construction next door begins at 8 am sharp every morning. You can't sleep past then, don't even try. The TV had no remote and only received one channel, I asked the front desk for a remote, they didn't have one and didn't seem to care.The air conditioners are loud and do not work all that well either.Parking is terrible, there is space for about 8 cars.For the price you can stay ANYWHERE else in Honolulu.The man at the desk was very rude to my son when he was visiting me as well.

<Content>Worst stay of the trip. We just returned from a 10 day trip to the Hawaiian Islands and The Breakers Hotel had to be the worst experiance in those 10 days.The owners of this place are undoubtably waiting on the big offer for their property because they are doing nothing to fix it up or improve it.Parking is a joke. There are only seven spaces and most of these are for the staff. You will carry your luggage a distance and noone will offer to assist you.Our only vanity in the bathroom was the top of the toilet tank. The sink is only crotch high. The shower makes a noise like a car starting.The bed linens are super thin and the pillows are almost non-existant.The TV had a converter box on top that you had to change the channels by hand, no remote. I think we had like 10 channels.Their web site advertises WiFi by the pool but when I inquired I was told they were waiting on parts. That is so much bull. You can purchase a wireless setup anywhere and have it going in 1 hour.Another problem we had is that in the European tradition they want you to leave your key at the desk when you go out and pick it up when you return. The desk is on the opposite side of the complex from the parking so you have to walk about a block to drop off and pick up your keys.Never ever again would we stay here.

<Content>loved the breakers We stayed at the Breakers upon recommendation of trip advisor and totally fell in love with it. You must like low-key to like it, we had a garden suite facing the pool and it was so peaceful and home like after the craziness of Waikiki. It was 60's decorated, but for us the only thing that mattered was that it was clean--it was spotless and only 1/2 block from Waikiki. To sit under the Banyan tree all enclosed by high rise, impersonal hotels--it was a treat. We actually would turn our key into the front desk before we left so they would know where we were. Highly recommend.

<Content>A Little Disappointed Discovered the Breakers thru Frommer email and booked for a few nights. Place is charming old Hawaiian style but needs updating. Pool and outside areas are very attractive and well kept but interior rooms are really dated , shabby, and not condusive to relaxing. There should be a comfortable chair or two in the rooms for reading or watching the news. The kitchenette area is circa '50's , small refrig didn't cool properly but we only used for water/drinks. Would not even consider cooking there. Rug on floor looked dirty and tiles in shower redone in areas and don't match. Tiles would be a better cleaner alternative.The Breakers has internet in the office but don't offer to guests...and all they would need is a router!! The office staff was very helpful and they keep an eye on everything.With a little tweeking the place would be fantastic! Walking distance to so much in Waikiki. We'll check next time to see if they have done any updating.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic It's often very difficult in this day  age (2008) to provide a decent type of review of somewhere we have stayed whilst on a vacation.However, there is always an exception to the rule which deserves a wondrous rating - My family (plus many friends recommended by us through the years) have stayed at The Breakers Hotel for many years, our 25 year old daughter considers it her home away from home  the best place for she  her friends to stay when going from Queensland in Australia for a vacation in Hawaii.Though the hotel isn't classified as one of the upmarket hotels in Hawaii, it is nevertheless, a classy  affordable island-style boutique hotel which offers first class service by all staff members - who are always genuinely available to provide assistance when required, the personal feature often missing in numerous other hotels. The suites have been regularly upgraded and offer very comfortable amenities with each person being given the opportunity to really relax and feel the Hawaiian older world style of the true Aloha spirit. The hotel also includes on its premises a very nice Japanese restaurant.( Donald Trump's business enterprise is rumoured to be constructing a luxury accommodation complex down the street so his people must believe the area is classy !)

<Content>Very nice hotel My girlfriend and I booked this hotel as students. We didn't have much money and most of the reviews were great. Our experience did not disappoint. We stayed for a week and except for some minor difficulties with parking there were no problems. The hotel is close to the beach, has a pool, and the staff were wonderful.  Note we have stayed in some 4/5 star hotels since then, and none have the friendliness and traditional flavor of this hotel.I would recommend this to anyone who is active, not fussy about little things and interested in exploring the city/island. This is not for someone who plans to spend there time in Hawaii at their hotel.

<Content>Best kept secret in Waikiki This was my third trip to Waikiki - I found this place on my first trip and have returned to the breakers twice now. Stuff paying $250-$300 a night at tyhe main hotels when you can stay here for just $130 a night. A 3 minute walk to the beach and all the night life and restaurants. My room was at least 4 times bigger than the one I had at the Outrigger Reef. The Breakers now has a Japanese restaurant where you can get good value meals with ample size portions.At this place you are not a room number but a PERSON because there are only 66 rooms, the pool always has lots of free space.All staff are extremely friendly and helpful.I shall definitely return again soon

<Content>I love the Breakers I loved the Breakers right from the start of the stay. The rooms are old, but the are authentic old Hawaii. The patios are cute with shoji doors. The refrigerator, although small, held our breakfast foods well and had room for pop. The noise never bothered me, especially with the A/C on. You don't spend your time in Hawaii in the hotel room, so why pay alot of money. This was a great value for a great stay.

<Content>Loved the Breakers My daughter and I have spent numerous vacations in Honolulu and were so excited when we found the Breakers. This property is so wonderful. The staff are so warm and friendly. The location is great...close to the beach and shopping. The Breakers provides a quiet, relaxing atmosphere for vacation. We loved the pool area. The room was also nice. We stayed in 206 which overlooks the pool. We can't say enough nice things about the Breakers. If you are looking for a quiet, less hectic place to stay...this is it. We can't wait to return.The Japanese restaurant onsite is really good. You will find the owners so friendly and food excellent.We love the Breakers!Steph and Carol from Oregon

<Content>I couldn't run away from this place fast enough... I was in a hurry to make a reservation and my usual haunts in Honolulu were booked up...so I trusted the reviews on Trip Advisor...Maybe I wasn't drinking the same kool-aid as the others, but this place was awful.I have a different standard for a room, especially as I travel to Honolulu for business most of the time. I like a place to be updated at least once every 10 years...this place had the original carpet and furniture from the 50's (30's??). They has some kind of kitchen area with refrigerator/oven that was disgusting. There was no air con except for a window unit and a table fan. And the bathroom would be perfect if you were3 feet tall and weighed 40bs.Amentities? I guess you are close to the beach and they have a pool. But there is NO parking, NO charm, NO ambience, NO internet (the tree was a joke), they have one large coffee pot by the front desk where you can have one cup...I mean...I guess some people like to spend $120 per night for this kind of place, but definately not me.Yes the people were nice, and yes I got a decent rate. I was booked for 3 nights and I checked out the next morning.This place is so old your grandparents would think it is old. I guess some people like this type of hotel. Be warned before you book.

<Content>Terrible customer service This was the second stay at the resort. While there we realized they offered a AAA discount. When inquiring at the front desk they said it was too late to change the rate. This was 1/2 way through our 4 week stay. When we asked to talk to managment we recieved the same too bad so sad response. I would not reccomend this hotel to ANYONE!!!

<Content>Old style Waikiki. After reading reviews here on TripAdvisor, I booked a garden suite at The Breakers, somewhat confused about its actual location. Contrary to what someof the maps show (such as Google's location when you google for it), this lovely charm of a hotel is located in a great part of Waikiki, accessible to everything by foot (from Aloa Moana to the Zoo). Our garden suite was on the ground floor, facing the pool. We loved that - just stepping out and sitting poolside. Lots of nice people staying there,most a bit older, only saw one family, no really young kids. The suite had a back room with a queen bed and a front room with two twins, which we used for relaxing (as there were only two of us). In between the two was a kitchenette area with oven, rangetop, sink, decent-sized fridge, and the cabinets were stocked with enough plates, utensils, and what-not to be useful. As you will read in other reviews, the hotel is an older building, concrete block, tacky-ish wall-paper, and shows its dated era and age. For us: so what? We liked the Japan-esque architectural influences (shoji screens on second floor rooms). We never usedthe A/C, but kept the louvres open for the steady breeze. If you want a boxy modern room with A/C and no openable windows, stay at a high-rise. Here, the staff recognized us. Yes, you do leave your keys at the front desk when you go out - just as with many European and Japanese hotels. We found the food at the Japanese restaurant good, but a bit pricey (hey, it's Waikiki). (Food tip: go to Irifune, a locals (not touristy) garlic-lovers Japanese restaurant at 563 Kapahulu - a 15 minute walk). About the parking: yes, there are only 8 spots at the back of the hotel. In our five days there I never once could not park there. I don't think most people have a car, and if I weren't there on business, I wouldn't have one either. All-in-all, I'd recommend The Breakers unless you want the pampered, ultra-modern experience. But hey, you can walk in to any Outrigger and buy that.

<Content>Like stepping back in time Stayed here for 6 nights after walking past on many trips to Hawaii previously. Great value for money, friendly staff. Felt very secure also as you have to buzz for them to open the front gate and you always are told to leave your key at the desk when you go out. Ask for a unit on the second floor with a lanai. Kitchens original with an oven and 2 hot plates. No microwave. Can be a little noisy if you want to sleep in as doors are japaneese style sliders. We were very thrilled when the lady at the front desk came out and gave us a fresh orchid lei each and a kiss and hug goodbye! You cant buy hospitality like that! Highly recomended if you want to go back in time and experince old Hawaii. Also very close to the beach. Half a block away up the Hilton Hawaiian Village end which is less crowded.

<Content>Loved this hotel I have just returned from 20 wonderful days in Hawaii and there I stayed in several hotels over the time but i must say the Breakers beats hands down the 5 star hotels for making you feel at home and relaxed, the rooms were clean and cofortable and there wasnt a thing that was to hard for staff when we requested it. The accommodation was beyond compare for the service, room and friendlyness we experienced. Definalty recommended I will return, i consider this my second home now.

<Content>Best Bang for the buck Stayed here for a week. Me and my girlfriend found the staff friendly and helpful. Kind of a motel-like atmosphere, but way better. You will not find a better hotel in waikiki for the money. If you want an ocean view, this is not the hotel for you. But for $100 a night it was awesome. Everything else was at least $180 a night (if you pay in advance). Definitely the place for those wanting to be close to the action, but not to lounge at the pool all day.Construction nearby clogged traffic, but did not affect us otherwise.One thing, parking sucks. There are only 7 spaces out back, and they fill up quickly at night. We paid for parking across the street for $11 a day. However, if I'm not mistaken most of the other hotels charge for parking as well. (Example: Outrigger on the beach is $18 a day for guests)There was also a cool little japanese restaurant in the hotel.Honestly, if you are on a budget stay here and spend the money you saved on glider rides on the north shore (it was awesome!)

<Content>A Gem My first stay at the Breakers was 25 years ago when I was a student. In the meantime, I鈥檝e generally moved up by a few stars but not in Waikiki. The Breakers is still my favourite here. The garden suites are great value for a family, our room was less than 30 feet from the pool 鈥?kind of a 鈥渄irect pool access suite鈥? There is a lot of space in the suites, also for luggage and clothing. The kitchenette makes is very practical, too. To be honest, the room design is dated and the bathrooms would certainly benefit from a renovation. Progress is slow here, but there WAS a remote control for the TV in our room.The ladies at the front office are always very pleasant and where else on earth have you met a bellboy refusing a tip for bringing the luggage to your room?Location is excellent, too. A short walk to the beach or central Waikiki, the bus stop is across the street. There was some construction noise from the Beachwalk project during our March 2006 visit. Once finished, the area around the Breakers will be a lot nicer.

<Content>Not my cup of tea My boyfriend and I stayed here when we were in Waikiki for a wedding. We picked this hotel because of its convenient location and because it was not expensive. I felt a little uncomfortable from the very beginning when we arrived and the desk clerk referred to me as my boyfriend's...companion after finding out that we weren't married. The initial pause and then delivery of the line made me feel like I was just some random girl he'd picked up for the night. Another time I returned to the hotel alone, and when I went to the desk to get my room key, the same clerk looked puzzled and actually leaned over the counter and looked toward the gate, obviously wondering where my boyfriend was. I felt like he was a little too interested in our business. As for the room, the bed sank in the middle, the air conditioning was problematic and the decor was a cross between Japanese and 60's -- but instead of seeming cute and retro, it seemed like they hadn't bothered to update or dust in 40 years. Now we laugh about our experiences there and some of them have turned into inside jokes, but at the time I was not happy to be staying there. We did receive a Christmas card, which is a sweet idea, but it was a bit bizarre (none of the staff looked happy to be in the picture). It wasn't a horrible experience, but I would not return. If you do go, I highly suggest you read the book Hotel Honolulu while you are there or shortly after you leave. We just happened to pick that book up while on the trip and my boyfriend said, Oh my God! The Breakers IS Hotel Honolulu! It was hilarious.

<Content>Love the Breakers My wife and I stayed there in april of 2005. for the money spent this is a great hotel. The room decor is old but its charming, there was even an original sticker on the shower wall from the 1960's that warns a traveller to use sunscreen. The kitchen facilities are adequate for your needs. Its close to everything in Waikiki including the beach. The pool and bar are nice although the bar could have better hours. The bar used to serve food but when I was there the cook had just quit and had not been replaced. That's probably rectified now. Watch out for the mai tai's, the bartender puts 3 shots of rum in them. One of those and you're not feeling any pain. The staff is fantastic, they even sent us a christmas card, the only hotel I've stayed at that has ever done that. That is what prompted me to write this review. When we return to Hawaii someday, we will definitely spend our time on Oahu at the Breakers. I hope it never gets torn down or changes owners. That'll be a sad day.

<Content>The Best Kept Secret Hotel in Hawaii I discovered this magical hotel during a previous trip to Hawaii.It is ideally located, about a block from Waikiki and about a block for Kalakaua Ave. As you close to everything as you will ever find.It is quiet, it is clean and it is affordable. The open air cafe is the source of, Quite possibly the best Hamburger in Waikiki, Tommy runs a class act there.The staff is attentive, friendly and responsive. I can not say enough about The Breakers. I have stayed there 8 to 10 times and have had a wonderful experience each time.Each room has a welcoming floral arrangement waiting for you when you sign in.

<Content>Great stay at the Breakers The Breakers reminds me of a 2-star European hotel - clean rooms, great service, but maybe a bit older and in need of some updating. My room had a nice king-size bed, air conditioning and a fan, a large shower (although the tile was old) and a small kitchenette. All this for less than $100/night and only 1/2 block from the beach at Waikiki. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely stay at the Breakers again.

<Content>Good hotel for the price, location and service When I first arrived and looked at the room, I did notice that it was bare basics and hot. But all things considered, I would stay here again. The location is perfect. The front desk service is wonderful and they really get to know you and look out for you. And of course the price can't be beat.These units are old. And if you like cold A/C, make sure your bed is by the window unit (I did!). I searched in vain for the TV remote control, only to realize that the TV was so old that it didn't have a remote. But it did work!The maid service is also friendly and there is a safe in the room, which we used for only $2 per stay. I liked that our little room for two adults (1 queen and 1 single bed) had a small refrigerator so we could keep drinks cold. It also has a small stove. You will need to bring your own shampoo, conditioner and hair dryer, although you can borrow a hair dryer and iron from the front desk when you need them.Just don't set your expectations too high and remember the great value that you are getting for the location, price and staff that looks out for you and knows you by name.

<Content>Would not honor Expedia reservation price I wanted to love this hotel, I had heard so many good things. We were only staying one night in Waikiki and chose Breakers. We checked in about midnight and were told they would not honor our Expedia reservation rate.. instead they made us upgrade to a room that was $80 more expensive. At midnight with 2 jetlagged kids we felt we had no other options. Construction that was directly across the street started LOUDLY and promptly at 7 am. Check out was at noon and we were glad to go.

<Content>Great Deal Our group of 8 (4 adults and 4 teenagers) recently stayed at the Breakers Hotel in Waikiki for 2 nights. The rooms, which we really only used for sleeping and and showering were clean and well kept. The courtyard with the trees and pool was great for relaxing between outings. The staff was very friendly and helpful with restaurant suggestions. The location is ideal for walking all over the Waikiki area and there is a Starbucks just down the street that opens early and has a great selection of pastries for breakfast. They are doing demolition work across the street, but we never found it bothersome. We would definetly stay at the Breakers again.

<Content>Great price, Great Location, Great Hotel! We stayed at the Breakers and were very pleased. The kids shared the bedroom with twin beds and my husband and I stayed in the master bedroom. The room came equipped with a full kitchen and eating area - and while I did not cook it was convenient for breakfasts. We would walk two doors up to Henry's for the most delicious cut up fruit (sometimes husband and son would venture two more doors up for McDonalds Spam and Egg. The staff is SO HELPFUL and friendly. Every night they gave us great restuarant suggestions and were so friendly and helpful. The rooms are VERY clean. Our room was a bit dated but I think others had been updated. There is free parking (but limited) one night we could not get a space but we could park on the street from 6pm to 7 am for free. Location is right in the heart of Waikiki - walk just a bit to the beach, shops, restuarants, bus, etc. Can't wait to return!

<Content>Hawaii old school style We LOVED the breakers. My guess is that this hotel has not changed at all in 40 years. If you want squeaky clean and new it's not for you. If you like a funky sixties feel this is the spot. Great location. If I go back I will ask for a second floor room overlooking the pool.
