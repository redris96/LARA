<Content>Almost perfect This hotel is one of the best hotels I have seen, and I am traveling a lot. I have to emphasize the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. Food is brilliant in the Brasserie and the Curtain Club. Rooms are exceptionally nice.Here are my critics:There is no smokers lounge. Guests have to smoke outside which looks a bit cheap. I was told that they used to have one but it was closed after complaints from guestsA charge of 5 EUR for 15 minutes internet in the business is a rip-off.My experience with the overnight shoe shine service was clearly not 5 star worthy: After leaving my shoes outside my room the night before I had to find them unpolished in the morning. They just put the shoe polish on but didn't give it a shine. At reception I had to argue with the shoe boy and listen to excuses, like there were a lot of shoes to clean that night. My shoes got a shine in the lobby and I got a shoe bag as apology.

<Content>Stately yet comfortable and welcoming My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in October. It is a lovely hotel and you can connect conveniently to anyplace in Berlin, using the subway or walking. Lots of restaurants and things to do right across the street at the Potsdamer Platz, where there is also the subway. The door man (wish I knew his name) was incredibly helpful with recommendations for places to go and things to do. The room was large and comfortable. The spa was wonderful - the massage was the best.

<Content>je ne sais quoi I can't put my finger on it but this hotel has something special. The service was great, the room was large, breakfast kicked butt and the spa and pool were terrific. The location on Potsdammer Platz is great. Most of the subway lines, the U and S trains, are across the street. The Matte district and Museum Island is not too far by cab ( 5 euros at the most). For a quick bite I recommend Vipiano the place next store. It's really good for pasta, pizza and salad. And it's cheap.  Beleive it or not the Ritz was a good value even at 225 euro a night. The Sofitel at Gendarmenmarkt was just as costly and half the hotel.Book through Amex for a better deal.

<Content>Rare luxury experience Luxury is a word that has been much abused in today's hotel industry, but it has been my experience that the Ritz-Carlton Berlin delivers true luxury. Most of the credit in what makes the difference between a luxury hotel and a true luxury experience goes to the staff. Indeed the Berlin staff had the ideal blend of deference and appropriateness, always very professional, impeccably clad and always prompt to help with intelligent responses. The staff was neither too pompous or overly ceremonial (which is often an issue with staff of luxury hotels) nor unprofessional/inappropriate as is too often the case. Of course the hotel itself was perfectly located within walking distance from the Brandenburg gate and the start/finish of the marathon, the reason of our stay there. The rooms and bathrooms were very spacious, a bit heavy on the mahogany and marble for today's decoration tastes, with superbly comfortable beds/linen. The bistro-style restaurant and breakfast were perfect and the spa appropriate, but felt a bit claustrophobic with no outside windows. Lastly, the added touch that made the difference was when we came back to the hotel after finishing the marathon, the entire staff in the lobby stopped and applauded to congratulate the runners.

<Content>Amazing Property-- Do Not Miss This Hotel!! We travel frequently and have stayed at some highly rated hotels in both larger cities (Georges V - Paris) and in smaller cities/towns) in the past, but our recent visit to this property was our best hotel experience ever. The room (Club Level Suite) was superb and the service levels -- from the Front Desk to the Concierge to the staff in the Club Lounge -- consistently were superlative. We were traveling with family and they provided adjoining rooms for us, something none of the other hotels (including other 5 star properties) were able to do. They went out of their way to cook special foods for my daughter (age 2) to ensure that she had plenty of things that she liked. Even when things did not go perfectly at first, we received an apology and they made things right. We had an amazing stay in Berlin thanks, in no small part, to the extraordinary staff at this hotel.

<Content>Wonderfull Stayed for just one night in the Ritz Berlin, arrived at 21.00 so didn't had much change to check everytging out. But what I saw was simply perfect.Very nice and warm welcome, quick and efficient check-in.The standard room itselve was simply perfect, the best bed I've ever slept in, 2 blankets and 8! pillows. The room is equipt with several chairs, a large desk and an art nouveau home cinema set.The bathroom is very large, offering a separate shower and tub. Classy amenities from Bvlgari.Extra's like minibar and roomservice is on an acceptable price level, the roomservice menu offers very great dishes for little ones and grownups.Definitely worth staying here, altough if you really want to be in the citycenter a bit far away...........

<Content>NIce and stuffy Stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 5 nights at the beginning of August. The hotel is very nice and makes a nice first impression, staff very friendly and helpful as would be expected. We stayed at this hotel after staying at 3 different Four Seasons in Eastern Europe immediately before (reviews posted). We love the Four Seasons and this was our first Ritz Carlton and were excited to see how they compared. While the Ritz Carlton is very nice it is decorated in an over the top stuffy style, my grandma would have LOVE it! The staff were very nice but there was just something missing compared to the treatment we had received at the Four Seasons but it is hard to put your finger on what it was. On one occasion we had had in room dining (which came with a card that said the trolley would be picked up in one hour.) Upon leaving the room we called to let them know that we would like our turndown service while we went for an evening walk. Upon return we came to a room which had had its turndown service but they had left the stinky trolley sitting there to greet us when we got back a couple hours later.On another occasion we were lounging in bed with the do no disturb light on and had a knock on our door. I peeked through the peek hole to see a hotel employee standing there.Overall though this is a nice hotel and from what I understand standard Ritz Carlton style. We did have a nice stay and the location is perfect.We booked our stay through the hotel website at a rate of 350 Euro per night for the lowest category room (we did get a slight upgrade on check-in though).

<Content>Better than the RC Powersocurt, not as good as the RC Osaka Last week I spent two nights in the Ritz Carlton in a Junior Suite ( 410 EUR per night, breakfast an extra of 28EUR). The hotel is part of the new Beisheim Center, built in elegant american architecture style and it includes the Ritz Carlton, office spaces, apartments and a Marriott Hotel as well. The Beisheim Center is owned by Otto Beisheim (80 years old German billionaire, founder of the Metro trade group) and located on the Potsdamer Platz, the former nomansland, where the Berlin Wall went through. I arrived at the hotel around 11:45am, albeit the early time, my suite was however ready. The problems started when I tried to enter my room - the keycard didn't work. So I asked somebody from the hotel staff, who was walking by, to open my room. I entered the room and had the intention to phone the reception desk to bring me a new card - unfortunately the phone didn't work. None of the 3 phones in my room. And 20 minutes already passed by and I was still waiting for my little piece of luggage to arrive in my room. So I went to the reception desk and asked for a replacement of my keycard and the whereabouts of my luggage and told them to get my phone working. After 10 more minutes my luggage arrived and I decided to try the spa and fitness facilites of the hotel. The swimming pool is rather small, just enough to refresh yourself. Two hours later I was back in my room and the phone still wasn't working. I got dressed and left the hotel, stopping by the reception desk, and told them again to fix the phone - which they did at an unknown time later that day.Some other annoyances: No LAN/Fax/phone/electric socket right on the writing desk in the room - it's all on the floor under the desk, so you have to crawl around. And no WiFi in the room. I think this is unacceptable for a brand new built 5*+ hotel.The suite itself is really nice. They did a great job in building this hotel but the service and some other details need improvement.FBWe ordered in Room Service for dinner as our dinner plans fell apart at the last minute. We ordered very simple food -- a cheeseburger with fries, french onion soup, a chicken panini, and caesar salad. The food was decent if not again aggressively salted. The meal was fairly timely (late by 7 minutes) but was not very hot by the time it arrived.Breakfast:The quality of the breakfast was decent but nothing mind-blowing. Service was awkward and not particularly attentive. Eggs were cooked to perfection and the coffee was excellent.ServiceI understand that we visited at a terribly busy time but fundamental service gaffes pervaded the hotel part of our stay. I think the hotel cannot handle the volume of business for its size and it most certainly did not handle the chaos very well.I had to prompt the hotel at almost every step -- the service was not effortless or intuitive; at best, it was reactive and only when prompted. We had requested turn down at a certain time, but housekeeping came at their convenience. When we asked her to return later, we were told that she could not come back.Such issues marred what could have been a wonderful stay and should not have happened at a hotel of supposed calibre as the Ritz Carlton.

<Content>Gorgeous Hotel, prime location Upon walking into the lobby, the supreme elegance of the lobby set the tone for our 2-nt stay. The room was equally elegant and spacious. Incredible bathroom/ shower with hidden ceiling speakers. Location is perfectt -- on Potsdamer Platz with multiple lines crossing through. Staff helpful as one would expect at a R-C.Advice: Take a bike tour -- Berlin is flat and has bike paths throughout the city. We took the tour that met at the Hackescher Mkt , and were led to the hostel around the corner to get the bikes. Excellent tour guide, and with the bikes, covered so much in little time.Restaurant Rec: Malatesta -- Italian restaurant with much better fare than most Italian places and with honest prices; run by passionate Italians who go out of their way to take care of you. Lovely outside tables w a view of the Gendarmenmarkt square. Restaurant Rec #2: Cafe am Neuen See -- a BiergartenGorgeous setting in a park-like setting. Will need a cab to get there probably.

<Content>Impressive attention to detail I stayed just short of a week and it was a pleasure. Courtesy was not too contrived - to a pleasant level. The room immaculate and very well presented. The location is great, just out the front door and down the steps to Potsdamerplatz. There is even a convenient shopping center adjacent to the hotel itself.As the title suggests, the attention to detail from all levels, from initial greeting by the doormen to checking in is impressive. A smooth ride all the way.I'll be back. Anyone spare me some change? =)

<Content>My Favorite Hotel in the World I have been lucky enough to stay in some beautiful hotels around the world. But the Ritz Carlton Berlin is by far my favorite hotel I have ever stayed in. I often find excuses to schedule myself layovers in Berlin when I travel just so I can try to book a room. I always stay on the Executive level as I find this is well worth it. Their breakfasts are massive and luxurious with increadible selections of fruits, cheeses, meats, nuts, and pastry items. Fresh orange juice and grapefruit juice is there as well. During the day they can make small sandwiches and salads which are excellent. Between breakfast and lunch I usually save mone eating in the lounge. The rooms are really spectacular for both business and leisure. Each room is equipped with a large flat screen telvision as well as an all region DVD player, so I could watch DVDs I brought with me in my room. From a design point of view, a wood-floor entery way with substantial closets, armoirs, and minibar give way to a carpeted living area with great space lovely furnishings and one of the most comfortable beds in which I have ever slept. The large marble bathroom has the best rainfall shower as well as seperate tub (this is one of the few tubs I know is clean enough to take a bath in). The staff are always excellent, while valuing professionalism over overt warmth, they are friendly and get the job done. Concierges (particularly Cairina and Thorsten) are excellent.There were some disappointments on my last stay. First, the quality of the food from room service was hit or miss and I really preferrred the food from the executive lounge. Furthermore, I could not get internet access in rooms on one side of the hotel as the design of the building blocks the WiFi signal. I had to change rooms to deal with this problem. I was then awoken at 8 o'clock in the evening say they needed to do repair work on my room (what I don't know). However, I was upgraded to a grand suite which was spectacular and a half bottle of Moet and Chandon was waiting for me with a hand-written note from the concierge apologizing for all the problems and thanking me for my continued busienss. One other disappintment: I was scheduled to leave the hotel on the day that President Medvedev of Russia was scheduled to arrive at the hotel. Despite the fact that German Federal Police began to close various parts of Pottsdammer Platz from early in the morning, the hotel would not tell me what was going on as they did not want to give away the secret of their VIP guest. His security etc., shut down Pottsdammer Platz and the lobby of the hotel for roughly 45-75 minutes. As I attempted to leave i was stopped. I very nearly missed an imporant connection to Munich for a business meeting because of this. Traffic around the Square was paralyzed and only because my train was delayed 45 minutes at Hauptbahnhof did I make it in time. While the hotel did send a bellman in a hotel car with me to the station to try to ensure I made it (which I eventually did), I was disappointed that staff were so secretive. Had they simply sent a note to all guests that an event was taking place which could cause delays during certain periods I could have changed my plans and avoided such problems. I have come to expect more from this lovely property. While it is difficult to discuss value when you are paying 300-400 Euro a night, comapred to what other hotels charge in Europe I am always happy to pay the roughly 350 Euro it usually costs to get a club room.

I have been priviledged, in that I have stayed at 3 other Ritz Carlton hotels before and they were all excellent. This one proved to be just as good.Front desk attention was brilliant, the room was very large with calssical design, all very new, superb details in the room, exceptionally comfortable bed, massive bath, lots of towels, brilliant toiletries (Bulgari), etc etc. Breakfast next day was very, very good - they had everything you could care to mention and MORE!Next time I'm in Berlin, this will AUTOMATICALLY be my choice.

<Content>Excellent all round After staying at the Regent, I found the Ritz Carlton to be in the same league but with a slightly more relaxed atmosphere. The room was large and very comfortable, with the details expected from Ritz Carlton. The bathroom was also superb, with one the best showers ever (after the Amstel in Amsterdam) and toiletries from Bulgari.The restaurants were all good, and I enjoyed the tea lounge (very large selection of loose-leaf teas) and the Curtain Bar. While I did not like the decor of the Desbrosses Brasserie, I had a good lunch there, and the breakfast buffet is fantastic (but the jams and fruit juices were better at the Adlon).The spa was, as in so many luxury hotels, underground, so you could not enjoy natural light and a nice view. The fitness and the sauna are very good but the pool is too small to swim laps.Overall, one of the best experiences in a European city hotel, although, for my taste, it lacks the authenticity and patina of some of the older palaces (Bristol Paris, Sacher, Amstel, Baur au Lac, Ritz Lisbon).

<Content>A stunningly suberb hotel that touches and exceeds all the bases This was our 2nd stay at this hotel and we chose it as the venue to celebrate my step-parents wedding anniversary. We had previously stayed on the club floor and again booked a club floor room for us and them and were pleased to find that standards were as good as before. Service in the Club Lounge is the best in its league in our experience and the staff are utterly friendly, welcoming, and professional. The daily food presentations and drinks cannot be faulted and the entire experience left us wanting more. The rooms are very well appointed and furnished to a very high standard, while the amenities are again without fault. We can recommend the Curtain Bar on the ground floor for both pre and after dinner drinks and the live music (piano and singer) set the right note for a relaxing end to both our evenings there. We took dinner on the first night in Desbrosses restaurant and with pre-notification from us they had prepared a menu of versions of their fare suitable for my mother-in-law who suffers from wheat intolerance. How's than for attention to guest needs?We are regular visitors to Berlin and will return again and again (budget permitting).

<Content>Deservedly number one... I picked this hotel based on the reviews here as this was a special birthday trip to be combined with running the Berlin half marathon. The excellent service started a few days before arrival when I was sent an email asking what time I was landing in Berlin and did I want my room early. We arrived at the hotel at our predicted time and were promptly and efficiently checked in and escorted to our room. The service and courtesy from all of the staff really made this hotel stand out - including the reception staff struggling with the Ryanair web page to check us in online for our return flight (obviously not many guests at the RC demean themselves by travelling on such an airline, and I have to admit this is the last time I'll use them).The contrast between Ryanair and the service at the RC really does show you get what you pay for. The room was large and comfortable, with all the luxury touches you expect from a 5 star hotel. The gym was good, and the breakfasts we had were good quality, but typical city hotel prices. For a city centre hotel, the whole experience is one of calmness and an escape from the hustle and bustle outside.The other major plus point of the Ritz Carlton is its location - right on Potsdamer Platz, making it close to transport links, food, shopping, entertainment and the excellent Gemaldgallerie along with several other galleries and museums. There are plenty of dining choices all around in all price brackets. I can thoroughly recommend 'Vox' restaurant at the Grand Hyatt nearby for a special occasion. Superb quality at reasonable prices (for the food) but 鈧?1 for a bottle of mineral water was a bit steep - especially since the 拢 has slumped against the 鈧?in recent months. Having previously stayed at the Marriot and Radisson SAS in Berlin, this was worth the extra for a special occasion, or just to experience service at a level not often found these days, even at other 5 star hotels I stayed at.

<Content>SUPER with a little but The hotel is luxurious, staff are polite except on our last day! The staff at the reception was either hung-over or on something high - she did not listen to what my husband had told/explained to her, in the end it went wrong and she had the ordersity to return to my husband asking him what he had already explained twice. Luckily enough there were sober fast-thinking people around to fix the problem quickly. We asked for hot water on a regular basis for heating up our baby's food, on one or two occassion the hot water brought up was brown. We ordered food from room service all throughout our stay because of our baby, we were not impressed with the room service menu and some of the food that was brought up. On one occassion, the wrong order was brought up but I was too hungry to notify them.I personally felt insecure on entering the building because of all the staff at the door, but all in all very clean, sheets  towels were changed on a daily basis. The breakfast crew were very polite and on top of things.

<Content>Pure relaxation in Berlin Stayed in the Ritz-Carlton Berlin for one week in early March, and had a great time!I stayed on the club level, and was thoroughly impressed by both the attentive service and relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel. The room itself was flawless, all rich colours and chandeliers, and very quiet. I also ate in the Brasserie Debrosses for breakfast each day, which was a pretty epic affair.Having previously stayed nearer the Ku'damm, the location of the Ritz Carlton was probably more appropriate for tourists, being near Potsdamer Platz, Under den Linden etc.I also found that the concierge and club lounge staff were excellent at providing good restaurant and travel recommendations.To summarise, the Ritz Carlton Berlin is the ideal case to explore and enjoy the delights of fantastic Berlin.

The rooms were large with beautifully appointed bathrooms and the staff managed to be friendly without being cheesy. I tried hard to find any fault, but this is just a great place to stay. I tried to book again for an easter break, but left it too late; so if you want near perfection- book early.

<Content>Superb service in every way My wife and I spent a week in Berlin staying at the Ritz Carlton.Our upgraded room (courtesy of American Express Platinum) was very big, beautifully decorated, and with a large bathroom with separate shower and every amenity. Towels were changed twice a day, unless you asked not to. The included buffet breakfast had everything you could possibly want...all kinds of breads, fish, fresh fruit and juice, dry cereals, etc. In addition , they made any hot dish you wanted, eggs, pancakes, etc. to order.The concierge (Marc and Thorsten) desk was fabulous. They made all of our restaurant reservations and the recommendations they added to our selections were excellent. They gave us perfect directions with clarity to all of the places we wanted to see, including Potsdam (Sans Souci)...via train and connecting bus.My wife had left a brooch in our hotel in Dresden. The concierge desk called the hotel we had stayed at; when that hotel, the Taschenbergpalais Kempinske, also excellent ,found the jewelry, they arranged to have the brooch sent overnight mail to us in Berlin without any expense to us.Lunch in the Debrosses Cafe/Bistro was superb. Everyone on the staff was pleasant and cheerful. We have stayed in many deluxe hotels, but the Ritz Carlton Berlin was one of the finest experiences we have ever had........and they had no attitude!

The faciities and the staff were quite amazing - all 5 star hotels need to examine the staff selection and training processes at this hotel.To top it off we were upgraded to a corner suite on arrival - it was an amazing room.One thing about the location - I found the area a little barren and deserted at night.A wonderful overall experience.

<Content>Just Perfect Everything was perfect, not one fault! and we were 5 couples. The staff was great, specially the doormen, waiters and staff at the concierge level. Rooms were everything you will expect, service and staff exceeded expectations, everyone was extra nice to all of us. Location was very good and without a doubt we will stay again.

<Content>Home away from home! I spent a week at the Ritz Berlin and can honestly say that I have never had a better experience at a hotel. I have stayed at several 5 star properties including the Ritz London, and the Ritz Berlin easilysurpasses them all. Every staff member is friendly and accommodating without being overbearing. I stayed on the Club level and feel the extra attention and amenities were worth the extra expense. I do agree with others who note the lack of variety with the food presentation, but it is not meant to replace a full meal. The drink service is impeccable- don't miss the double mocha macchiato.The Spa is small, but very nice and I had the facial of a lifetime!! The fitness room is also small, but well equipped.Location is very central, many sites are in walking distance and several hop-on/hop-off bus tours depart across the street from the hotel. I will definitely return to the Ritz when in Berlin.

<Content>Deserves to be No. 1 The Ritz Carlton Berlin deserves the No.1 ranking in Berlin. It is one of the few hotels we have stayed in that manages to get everything right.The entrance is very impressive 鈥?sweeping double staircase  elegant d茅cor. There must be a very happy marble salesperson somewhere. Prompt  efficient attention from the Front desk.Our king bed room on the Club Floor (10th) was large, comfy, luxurious and well-appointed. The bathroom is something else 鈥?acres of marble, separate walk-in rain shower, separate loo, two basins and large comfortable tub. Topped off with a beautiful orchid plant and Bulgari toiletries. There are some really good modern touches, such as electronic control centres for lights, curtains, 鈥渄o not disturb鈥?indicators, next to the bed.The Club lounge is on a par to our previous favourite at the Fairmont in Boston. Very plush and comfy, with food almost constantly available  very attentive bar  drinks service. The breakfast spread was lovely 鈥?loads available at the buffet, including probably the best bacon  eggs we have tasted at a hotel anywhere.Apart from the luxury, what really sets the Ritz Carlton apart from competitors is the level of service. The General Manager should be commended for the uniformly excellent service across the entire hotel. Friendly, professional, unobtrusive service at all levels. An example is that we were brought complimentary glasses of water in the lobby whilst waiting for a friend without even asking. Costs the hotel nothing, but makes a real difference. Another is that the Club lounge staff remember guests鈥?beverage preferences at breakfast. Otahuna Lodge in New Zealand is the only place we can think of that competes on service. The location is very good. Although we always find Potsdamer Platz a bit soulless, there is no doubt that it is a very convenient central location. Excellent transport links with U-bahn and S-bahn services directly across the road.We highly recommend this hotel. We visit Berlin regularly, and will make sure we stay here in the future.

<Content>The Ritz-Carlton Berlin lives up to it's reputation It will sound terribly blase but the Ritz-Carlton in Berlin is the best hotel I have stayed in Berlin and one of the best I have stayed in worldwide.What makes it truly outstanding is not the facility,although it is grand in the old world style.Rather it is the impeccable service from every single staff member I came into contact with during my 3 day stay!The sort of service that go's out of it's way to make you feel comfortable with receiving assistance.If you ask where is the breakfast room (mmm,don't get me started on the breakfast buffet...) any member of staf you ask will not point out the way or give you directions.Rather with a polite smile they will simply say follow me sir and lead you all the way there!If you walk into the lobby with a piece of paper in your hand the staff will catch your eye and politely ask whether they can relive you of your burden!and so on and so on.Really a rare experience in todays world of pre packaged microwaved service!Throughly recommended!

<Content>Pure luxury in Berlin Visited this hotel last week on a business trip, only stayed one night, but have already booked a surprise visit for my girlfriend in the lead-up to Christmas.This is simply one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and is dripping with class. The location is perfect and the staff and so polite and very approachable.For a city centre hotel, the room size was off the scale, with a walk-in wardrobe, ginormous marble floored bathroom with gorgeous round bath, separate room for WC and huge 'drench' shower.I arrived late and felt peckish, so enjoyed a perfectly cooked steak and vegetables, brought to my room in a heated trolley within 25 mins.Check-in and check-out very painless, but breakfast was on the pricey side (you can go a la carte for 鈧?0  drinks, or buffet for 鈧?0 - 拢20 - $40 per person, per day)Just an incredible experience - bring on December!

Very close to the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, Checkpoint Charlie and Unter den Linden. If only in Berlin for a short visit take the tour bus to see the sights which leaves opposite the hotel.

<Content>Excellent Location, Good Price, Friendly Staff When is a deal too good to turn down? 鈧?95 per night at the Ritz-Carlton is a deal, a steal - the sale of the century! I had a wonderful view of Potsdammer Platz. Now it took this deal to prise me away from the Kempinski - (still my favourite crash pad in Berlin) and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff were very friendly and made an effort to get to know me, especially the porters and the bar staff. The room was very tasteful and the bathroom elegant. There was only one downside, and it is a singular gripe that I have with many hotels and that is the charge for using the wireless broadband. This of course will become a thing of the past when mobile broadband becomes more common place.

<Content>Very Elegant It doesn't get more luxurious. Everything dripping in chrystal and gold; yet the staff was not pompous and were very helpful. Hotel's location on Pottsdamer Platz is alive and fun and tour trolley for hoping to sights is on nearby corner. The breakfast buffet might keep you there all morning, it's fantastic. The cafe restaurant has great choices at realistic prices although it needs some breaking up into smaller areas; it's one wide open space with no charm. The Bar is stunning and expensive but worth a visit. The only annoyance was all the card advertisements in the room  especially the bathroom; very tacky for such a gorgeous place.

<Content>Ritz Carlton delivers again and more..... What a great level of service, this hotel surpassed our high expectations. We had requested an early check-in from 9am, arrived at 8.30 and our room was ready - not always the case in our experience. The room was great, with all the usual ritz carlton standards met. It was our anniversary on the Saturday and though we didn't tell anyone in the hotel they noticed the cards in the room, waited for us to return from our day out and promptly delivered some flowers 'from' the hotel. Aside from the service the location is great for visiting Berlin with many attractions in walking distance and both the u-bahn and s-bahn on potzdammer platz less than a minutes walk from the hotel.

<Content>Another perfect 5 review What more can be said about this hotel. We spent 3 nights at the Ritz-Carlton in early June as part of a 9 city trip to Germany, Austria, Budapest, and Prague. Of the 9 five star hotels we stayed at, this was our favorite city hotel. The weekend rate makes this hotel a real steal compared to its competition. Special raves about the incredible buffet breakfast. We loved Berlin, especially compared to Prague. My wife a true shopper highly recomends KaDaWe, Berlin's answer to Harrod's. The food pavillion is an incredible bargain and treat.

<Content>Old World Traditional Ritz-Calrton Elegance in Contemporary Berlin The Ritz-Carlton Berlin exudes old world traditional elegance, more than I have seen in any of their other properties.From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by friendly doormen, and an abundance of chandeliers. The lobby is reminiscent of something you might see in Versailles, as another reviewer noted. Although I am a young traveler, I remain open to a variety of taste levels, including those that are more traditional in style. That being said however, the Ritz-Carlton Berlin has taken opulence to another level, which I often felt imposing throughout my stay.Firstly, let it be said, that service, comfort and quality were all exceptional, and delivered in true Ritz-Carlton fashion. I felt however, that the design of the hotel was more conducive to hosting dignitaries, than it was a place to relax. I tend to enjoy a hotel, which caters to a variety of purposes, as I feel most newer Ritz-Carlton's do. The service at this property is fantastic, and typical of most Ritz-Carlton's. Despite the language barrier, communication is excellent, and the staff was superb.The location of this hotel was quite central, and adjacent to the modern Sony Center. Just blocks away from the hotel are Berlin's most historic attractions, as well as the city's famous shopping street.The rooms were well appointed, but again opulent and quite gaudy. Rich woods, gold colors and frills were all used in the decor, to make the rooms appeal more to the liking of a king, than a Ritz-Carlton guest. We enjoyed a club-level deluxe room, which was spacious and allowed us access to the Club lounge. The lounge features were nice, but not as generous as others I have seen. There were three food presentations each day, including breakfast, lunch and a combined evening hourderves and dessert. I felt that many of the items were repeated each day. As with the rest of the hotel, we felt quite intimidated by the Club environment. Given our younger age (mid twenties) we were often given the look in the lounge.The Ritz-Carlton Berlin is a great hotel, but may only appeal to a limited audience. Given the opportunity to visit Berlin once again, I might decide on another hotel. Rarely have I had this opinion on a Ritz-Carlton property, and I've stayed in several worldwide.If you desire opulence and grandeur, this very well could be your hotel of choice, as it still upholds all the traditions of a Ritz-Carlton.

<Content>Chandelier overdose! Arrived in Berlin after a long business trip in London, in order to celebrate 2 years anniversary with my partner. booked directly with the hotel's website since it had the best offer, better then all the other sites i know that offer hotels deals (expedia, tablet etc.) and based on the reviews on tripadvisor i chose the club room with lounge access. this is a good choice since you get a great room and access to the club lounge that offers 3 meals a day - buffet style - that turned out to be a real EUR saver.my feelings about this hotel are mixed. on the one hand, i agree with most of the reviews here, saying that the hotel is beautiful, the rooms luxurious, the service very personal and the spa small but really nice. however, this is a traditional hotel, very formal and, with a luck of a better expression - made me feel OLD (i'm 36).the clientele vary from 50+ years old - old money - people and/or businessmen in Armani suits. everyone is talking really quietly and the atmosphere is frozen. it's not hip, not happening and worse of all 鈥?has no pulse. so if you are looking for a happening hotel - forget it, this is NOT it. but if you are looking for traditional elegance - you will love the Ritz Berlin a last thought - for its caliber - the Ritz Berlin is really not that expensive. The room you get for 375 EU at the ritz berlin will cost you 700 in paris, and about 500 POUNDS in London. so if you are coming to Berlin this is really a good opportunity to stay where the REALLY reach people stay - and pay a reasonable price. but forget about fun and be prepared for stiff elegance.

<Content>Elegant old-style posh hotel for the 'ritz'! O.k, so i didn't exactly fork out the 500 euros per night for this hotel, we stayed complemenary since my freind, a journalist, was doing a story about the hotel. although the service is beyond service, the food excellent and the rooms stunning, i didn't feel that comfy there, but that's probably because it was me, not used to such luxoriousity. every time you enter or leave the hotel, it's a big deal with the doormen opening and closing the doors for you - that's not for me, just leave me alone. you canno't be annonemous at this hotel. while we stayed there, we saw presidents of countries, diplomats and royals. this is cleary a hotel for the rich and famous.the rooms are amazing, with stunning furniture and the most amazing bath and WC i ever saw. they are large and spacious. the location is great at the western part of the city, in potsdamer platz, right opposit the marriot and the sony center with IMAX 3D, and a starbucks around the corner.

<Content>pure luxery! Well first off. we didn't book to stay at this hotel, we were soposed to stay at the marriot nearby but our first night was double booked, so they upgraded us to this hotel, not that we were complaining, and then we had to be upgraded to a deluxe room because there standerd rooms were fully booked... so yea we felt like we like stars! the staff are very friendly, couldn't do more for you, the rooms were huge, very confy beds, and an extremly posh bathroom. they also supplyed posh toiletries ( la prerie or somthing like that) so of course we took them as were getting free desinger stuff! the location is excellent accross the road from the sony centre which was very nice with bars and the like. the breakfast was very good as you would expect, set in a french resturant very nice. choice was excellent. we were sad when leaving back to the marriot in the morning... but as you can read from my marriot review that it's as good as the ritz which is a hard thing to do! so the only thing we can't comment on is the price payed because we got this for free almost.

<Content>The place to stay! We booked the hotel for 5 nights (beginning of January) at a winter special rate of 鈧?95 with breakfast. In addition to the extravagant buffet, the breakfast includes omelets etc prepared to order in the open kitchen.We arrived at 9:00 AM and we were immediately shown to our room. So quiet and the bed so good, we didn't wake until 3:00 PM when we taxied to KaDeWe for oysters and glasses of Riesling on the Feinschmecker (gourmet) floor. If you are a foodie, this floor is a great experience.The staff is really friendly; no snooty airs here. Kudos to the doorman who put the fear of God into a taxi driver who took us the long way around to boost the fare.As for the location compared to the Adlon, I think Potsdamer Platz is far more interesting. It's where the action is and is walking distance to some very good museums near the Philharmonie (we booked concert tickets online).As throughout Europe, they charge too much for Internet, but you can buy an hour at a time which was more than enough to answer e-mails. Free WI-FI is available at the Sony Center but not something you want to do in the winter. What I did appreciate was that the hotel did not block or charge for 0800 numbers. Using a prepaid credit card, I was able to call USA for 6.4垄 a minute. I even used the card to call Berlin.

<Content>Great hotel Just came back from two wonderful nights at the Ritz-Carlton Berlin.We arrived at 9 am on a Friday morning and the first pleasant surprise was that we could get our room immediately. We had booked a deluxe room which was very spacious with windows on two sides. The room was impeccable and it is very obvious that a huge amount of money has been put into the construction of this place. Personally, I would have preferred a more modern design instead of the old-style chic but the room, the bed and especially the bathroom remain a true delight. Fantastic bed and fantastic shower. We were quite surprised to find an old-fashioned box of a TV set but we didn't turn it on at all during our stay. I'm not a big fan of the Ritz-Carlton toiletries and would have preferred the Bulgari products.The rooms are really quiet and we didn't hear any noise at all. It was only at breakfast that we realised that the hotel was, in fact, VERY busy.The first morning we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table for breakfast and everything was rather stressful including the service. However, the quality of the food is outstanding.The staff is excellent and they truly seem to care about what they are doing.The only thing we didn't like about the place and which really needs improvement is the gym. If you only use cardio machines you will be OK but if you want to do some weight training you will VERY quickly run out of options. There is basically just one seated row and one chest press machine + some dumbbells. This is simply not acceptable for a new hotel of this standard. Furthermore, the gym is right next to the gym which makes the air too hot and too humid for a good workout. We liked the central location on Potsdamer Platz as it is very convenient to commute both to the western and eastern parts of Berlin. Many attractions are within walking distance.Overall a wonderful hotel and fantastic value for money.

<Content>loved the ritz We have just returned from a wonderful three nights stay at the Ritz Carlton. We stayed in a club room and it was certainly worth the extra. We were checked in, in our room and what a room it was. It overlooked the sony centre and tiergarten. The room was immaculate as was the whole hotel. Staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The whole experience was first class as you would expect and it is justifiably the number one tripadvisor hotel in Berlin. Look no further than the Ritz Carlton if you want 5 star luxury and to be within walking distance of all the sights.

<Content>Sets the standard for 5-star hotels Stepping out of the taxi and being greeted by name by the doorman who'd taken the trouble to check it on the baggage tags, you know you are in for something very special. The kindness and friendliness of the staff take the concept of service to a whole new level. Check-in fast, friendly and efficient. The rooms are very good although they are a tad kitsch for my taste but you can judge for yourselves from the photos. Despite being in a busy area, the rooms are very quiet. I slept perfectly. Good satellite TV. The broadband wireless connection in my room didn't work very well with lots of dropouts but it's fine for email. In the desk there is an ethernet cable so you can hook up to the RJ-45 plug in the room, but I only discovered this on the last day ! Access costs 鈧?.95 for 60 mins, 鈧?9.95 for 24 h. Breakfast was excellent.Truly, an excellent hotel.

<Content>Loved the Ritz-Carlton I stayed at this hotel, for one night at the end of August. I'm very fussy but I found the service to be excellent and the room itself was very good indeed. Although it was only a standard room it was large with 2 queen sized beds and lots of lovely big pillows and cushions. The bathroom was the best I've ever had with a lovely big shower as well as a bath.Although the building is modern it has a faux ninteeenth centruy interior but manages not to look tacky. I've stayed at many excellent hotels, including the Crillon in Paris which is supposed to be one of the best hotels in the world, but to be honest, this one was better and the bathrom was in a different league altogether.My only complaint was that the air con wasn't very efficient but it wasn't too hot so this was not a major problem. It might be different in a heatwave though. Also, I was next to some sort of service room which was a little noisy - although not enough to warrant complaining about. The breakfast is in the bistro, a genuine french bistro that they dismantled and rebulit in the hotel, I understand. It's a lovely seeting and although I'm not usually that keen on buffet breaksfasts this one was excellent - one of the best with very good selection of good quality foods.If you're looking for a 5 star hotel in central Berlin and are dont' want a small 'boutique' hotel then you won't do better than the Ritz-Carlton.

When the lounge co-ordinators meet you with a hot towel for freshening up on arrival then you know that this is going to be special. And it is. We were booked into to a Deluxe room with stunning views over the Sony Centre, Tiergarten and Siegassaul. In our room on arrival, with a welcome note from the hotel, were fresh fruit platters, half bottle of champagne. Fantastic. The rooms are beautifully decorated, very spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms are huge and also beautifully presented with double sinks, seperate shower and bathtub (double sized!) and to round it off, La Prairie products everyday.The staff on the Club level (to be fair the whole hotel) where amongst the most efficient and professional staff I have encountered in years of travelling. They could not be more helpful without being cringing. Food and drink presentations spot on every day.One small minor gripe. I think the wellness centre is really geared more to the SPA users with the pool being small but again beautifully decorated with really, friendly helpful staff. Great for a short splash about.So overall, outstanding. Just go and see for yourself.

<Content>ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT When we arrived we were told we could not check in to the club level (reason was Robbie Williams checking out that day) until 5pm. They were hoewever very appologetic and gave us lunch on the house. Very good impression.The rooms were great, facilities as well and the service the best we have recieved in our month trip in Europe. Everyone was friendly and went out their ways to make us feel at home. It was so great we ended up extending two more nights. Really can recommed to relax but still be in the middle of everything. Perfect location.

<Content>This hotel rocks! The Ritz in Berlin was incredible - loved it. The reception, concierge and doorman all outstanding. Rooms and food great. The location is key, next to Potzdamer Platz, the Sony Center (spectacular) and a small section of the Berlin Wall. It is within walking distance of museum island, checkpoint charlie, holocaust museum, etc. We visited the Adlon and found quality of location and hotel personnel not even close to the Ritz.

<Content>Best Location in Berlin My daughter and I loved this hotel. It was perfectly situated near the Sony Plaza,Ubahn,Sbahn and many museums. The only thing I would do differently is not stay on the Club Floor. The 3 food courses served daily had no variety. If you don't mind the same buffet everyday,you would love the club floor. Room great. No real extra service for being on club floor. Great doorman.

<Content>My new favorite in Berlin! The Ritz-Carlton just made top of my list of favorite hotels in Berlin, bumping The Adlon to second place.Why is that?While the two hotels are quite similar in that they are both newly build in an old style it feels to me as if The Adlon is a bit burdened with it鈥檚 own glorious paste while The Ritz-Carlton is more playful and not full of itself.The service is excellent in both places, but again it鈥檚 more freely given at The Ritz.I stayed for four nights in a superior bedroom, a bottle of Champagne awaited me on arrival and the breakfast buffet was included. I was on the Club-level but without the privileges.I spend time in the wellness area every day and I tried both the gourmet Vitrum restaurant and The Brasserie Desbrosses. I even took tea in the lobby one afternoon, and that was the only experience that was not absolutely perfect.It seemed to me that too few servers were on duty that day 鈥?a famous VIP was arriving could be why 鈥?especially as they insist on pouring your tea. I also had the feeling that they thought I was waiting for someone when I sat down and didn鈥檛 approach me before I got obviously restless. There鈥檚 a very easy solution to that 鈥?approach and ask!It also seemed to take the server by surprise that I take milk in my tea 鈥?she poured a cup and took about five minutes to bring out the milk when I asked for it. That鈥檚 just not professional 鈥?and it did not give me the option of pouring milk before tea.But in the over all picture this is nothing 鈥?my room was perfect, the wellness area though small was beautiful and since it has a counter current system it is possible to get a good workout.One evening I started with a drink in the lovely very English Club like bar and continued on to a perfect dinner at Vitrum, where I was introduced to the chef at the end of a spectacular meal with a new champagne for every course.On my final evening I stopped for a quick meal at Brasserie Desbrosses 鈥?where the amazing breakfast buffet is served every morning 鈥?and had a lovely well-cooked simple French-style meal at a very reasonable prize.It鈥檚 not often that you find a place like this in a hotel 鈥?there was nothing bland or assembly line over the meal.The brasserie in itself is fun to study 鈥?it was found in a small town in France, taken apart, restored and shipped to Berlin to end up at Portzdammer Platz. A pretty amazing tale.Well, to sum it up: Ritz Carlton is my new home away from home in Berlin!

<Content>Only Place to Stay in Berlin I can't imagine staying anywhere else when i visit Berlin. This is a true Ritz-Carlton, none of those cheap rooms that have been dressed up. The staff is very friendly and helpful- there always seems to be someone there when you need them. The conceriege sent us to fabulous resturants and everyone was wonderful! The location is also great, there is a S-Bahn station in from of the hotel and the The Reichstag area is a 5 min walk and Checkpoint Charlie is a 5 min walk too!

<Content>Simply said: PERFECT! A stay at the Ritz Carlton in Berlin is definitely a treat. I just came in from a short and demanding business trip to singapore (where I also had the pleasure of staying at the Ritz-Carlton) and went directly to Berlin. They gave me a Club Level room (without the privileges) and although my personal taste is much more on the modern side, I just loved the classic beauty of the Karl Friedrich Schinkel-inspired furniture. The room is spacious (working desk with ink-well and old-fashioned nib), the bed is a dream (yes, they have a pillow menu to choose from), the marble bathroom does have a heated floor (if it is not warm enough for your taste, ask housekeeping: they will turn it up), the TV cabinet also houses a DVD-player as additional entertainment option. And did I mention they actually placed a La Prairie body emulsion with the bathroom amenities? The Spa is luxurious, the small gym has the latest state of the art technogym equipment.But all this would not make the Ritz-Carlton the extraordinary place it is without the Ladies and Gentlemen working there.My company hosted a four-day client event at the Ritz-Carlton. One evening, we had a special guest (a well known up-and-coming German actor) invited for dinner outside the hotel. We returned and settled for drinks at the Curtain Club. You know, they don't close as long as there are guests... and the night became longer and longer with drinks and talk. At two thirty in the morning, the actor and one of the top managers felt like playing a round of chess and they asked the bartender if he had a board. When he declined, the actor off-handishly said something along the lines of: ...that's kind of weak, I thought this was a luxury hotel... A quarter of an hour later, the night concierge had found a set of figurines. He also downloaded the image of a chess-board from the internet and had it printed on canvas... so the guests got their game of chess, which lasted until six a.m.. ...going above and beyond the usual duty of a bartender and a concierge is what makes the Ritz-Carlton so special. Needless to say, everyone in the entire group learned about the famous chess-board......and this was not the only time the staff at the Ritz-Carlton proved to be the heart and soul of the hotel. All our clients, who are seasoned and demanding travellers, were very pleased with their stay at the Ritz-Carlton - and for me, the RC is definitely the hotel by which I measure every other hotel I stay at.One other thing I can recommend: Try the afternoon tea - served on fine Wedgewood porcelain, it is a luxurious passtime that has style and flair...

<Content>The best choice in town The location is second-to-none: On Potsdamer Platz, next to the Sony Centre featuring futuristic architecture and countless bars, restaurants and shopping opportunities. Within walking distance of the Reichstag, Brandenburg gate, Holocaust memorial and Berlin Philharmonic Hall. The hotel is true Ritz-Carlton material. Excellent service, beautiful building  amenities.Worth every cent. Would recommend absolutely.Service at the Desbrosses brasserie restaurant on the slow side but this seems to be a general syndrome that we noticed at each restaurant in town.

<Content>Surprises A surprise 5 day anniversary trip to the Ritz Carlton Berlin was absolutely fantastic. Our room was turn -right-out-of-the-lift-and-count-23-chandeliers... We were on the club floor, fabulous and ideal for the family gathering. Enthusiastic and genuinely friendly staff made it feel very special. The highlight was our exquisite meal in the Vitrum and the piece de resistence? Lowered lights, the music from our wedding, a very special cake decorated with candles, and suspended on choclate tapers a breath taking diamond ring(that bit costs extra). Worth it,oh yes.I'd recommend this hotel unreservedly.

<Content>The place to be We spent two nights in this extravagant hotel and decided to book a club room. Having been a guest in some other fine Berlin hotels, I must say this one is by far the best.The staff is not only professionel and catering to every need, but really friendly. No matter whom you will meet, the bellboy, the ladies from the housekeeping or a manager everyone will wish you a good day. And it seemed to me, they really meant it - that was not just the result of good training.The room was spacious,nicely decorated with lots of cherry wood, the bed perfect, everything could be operated by a touchscreen panel - even the curtains.The club lounge offers three food presentations and drinks all day long. The staff on the club floor is just perfect! They will know what your wishes are, before you tell them. And they will remember your name.The amenities are chosen with a faible for details and a sense of humour: You will find a Berlin pancake (some kind of filled doughnut) in your room, which is a wellknown specialty of the town. At night I did not only find a handwritten greetingcard, but lavender too.In the bathroom you will find candles and fresh orchids!The location is convenient: at the Potsdamer Platz, close to the Philharmonie, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag and adjecant to a wonderful park, the Sony Center and a mall.I can highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>fantastic Have just returned from a 3 day stay at the Ritz Carlton Berlin. This is a fantastic hotel. The service was exceptional. Stayed in a Club Lounge room -which is certainly worth the extra few euros - complimentary drinks from 6am to 10.30pm, breakfast, lunch and nibbles in the evening. The lounge is tastefully furnished as is the rest of the hotel. The room was spacious, the bed very, very comfortable and the little extras ie water, donoughts and a present from St Nicholas were really appreciated. Ate at Debrosses which was lovely - the portions were enormous. The next evening ate at a French restaurant called Le Piaf - recommended to us my Alexandra in the Club Lounge. This was in Charlottesburg and thoroughly worth the 15 euro taxi ride. The whole stay - though brief was fantastic - any bad reviews on this site take with a pinch of salt. RC number one as always - thanks for a wunderbar time.

<Content>Great Service My partner and I just returned from a week stay. A lovely hotel, the service is outstanding (most 4 star US properties could not compare), the location is very central for walking, touring and getting any number of busses, trains, and trams. Don't expect any gorgous views from the hotel, but the food, room service, spa, and many other ammenities make this place truly first class.

<Content>Wonderful Outstanding hotel in great location. Near the new holocaust memorial, the Mitte, Branderburg Gate, the Reichstag, etc. Incredibly comfortable beds and terrific breakfast in the hotel restaurant.Very polite and helpful staff although the concierge was alittle strange but did recommend a wonderful restaurant and got us a great table. Overall a wonderful stay. Pool was closed for renovation when we were there but I didn't fly from LA to Berlin to go swimming and they gave us a gift from the spa because the pool was closed which was a nice touch.

<Content>All's well that ends well I stayed at the Ritz twice, at the end of July and a week later in August. It was not a problem-free experience. I had decided on this hotel in large part due to the spectacular-looking pool and fitness facilities(check out their webpage). So, I get to the hotel after a long train ride. At check-in the reservation agent upsells me on a more expensive room which I hate but reluctantly accepted. I get to the room and ask the porter how I get to the wellness area and the pool. He gives me a startled look and explains that both those areas are closed for renovation. The hotel is barely over ONE year old. So, I go back down and ask why this was the first time I had heard anything about it. The folks at the front desk claimed it was supposedly sent to me via email but I double-checked and no such information was ever provided. They did, to their credit, remove the upsell amount and let me stay in the room. Nonetheless, I was sorely disappointed.Otherwise, the hotel was fairly empty and the service was pretty good. They had some excellent people working the nightshift who seemed to know what they were doing and cared. The location is good and the breakfast spectacular. The staff is large and generally efficient and careing. I will stay there again, hopefully with a working wellness area.
