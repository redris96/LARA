<Content>Great for a Budget My partner and I went to Singapore for 10 days.We are in the hotel for 8 nights and it was all we needed. While there are more luxurious hotels, we wanted a bed and a shower.I would like o say to those who are saying bad things about this hotel - its a cheap hotel and if you want something posh you have to pay accordingly.Would not hesitate in recommending for those wanting something basic for a budget getaway.

<Content>Nice hotel within budget Nice hotel for budget traveller. I was there for 4 nights along with my wife. This hotel has got all facilities what a person may require but within a limited range. Morning Breakfast is the area of improvement.

<Content>value for money This hotel is comfortable although the air conditioner was angled directly to the bed so we moved had to move it (the bed). It was very reasonably priced and good value for an overnight stop. We were on a budget as we were overseas for 4 months. Breakfast was very good (as much as you wanted) bacon eggs cereal etc.The room was clean and the bed comfortable (most important). There is a gym there although we got our exercise walking. There is also a lift . The staff were nice and helpful and the night we left kept our bags in the office as we didn't leave until midnight. For a 1 or 2 night stay I would thoroughly recommend this hotel

<Content>Disgusting!!!!!! UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES STAY AT THIS HOTEL. IT IS A HEALTH HAZARD!!! My husband and I stopped in Singapore for 3 nights on our way back to Australia from Vietnam. We didn't want anything flash, just somewhere to put our luggage and sleep so after reading the reviews I thought this would be fine. WHAT A MISTAKE. The room was so small we could hardly move around the bed and this was supposed to be a Superiour Queen Room! The shower was over the toilet and water went everywhere when we showered. The air conditioner was so loud we could hardly sleep and it couldn't be adjusted by the control. The room was covered in mould and mildrew and we couldn't open the fridge without gagging from the smell!!!! We stayed one night and had to check out!! Both of us were worried about our health! This made our trip to Singapore very disappointing.

<Content>small but fairly efficient This hotel is quite isolated and you would need a taxi or bus to get anywhere near town. It's fairly efficient with polite reception staff. On the downside, the rooms are small and compact which may spell trouble if you have large cabin cases. Breakfast is al fresco and basic but you get what you pay for. We stayed near the top of the hotel and didn't hear any clanging noises probably from some water tank that some reviewers had written about. Also, no one had knocked at our door asking if we want company in the wee hours (the room is too small for such purposes anyway!) and we didn't see any couples coming in for love activities but maybe we couldn't tell them apart from the other tourists! The hotel is quite far from the airport and you can easily arrange with the efficient reception for the 30 - 45 minutes ride to the airport. All in all, this is a small hotel which is suitable for a short stay of one or two nights.

<Content>Very pleasantly surprised. We stayed at the Harbourville for 4 nights at the end of July at the start of our 4 wks in Singapore  Malaysia.After reading some of the reviews,I was a bit apprehensive but the original hotel we wanted was fully booked  the price was right.We were, therefore, very pleasantly surprised by the great service we received. We arrived 5 hours early for check in due to flight timings  the receptionist went out of her way to have our rooms prepared quickly  did not charge any extra.The rooms were small but spotless as were the bathrooms but more than adequate for the amount of time we actually spent in the room.Also, for the amount we paid, we were not expecting Raffles type luxury but we had no complaints.Breakfast was ok but the guy who worked very hard on his own making it was very obliging.Yes its a bit out of the way but public transport  taxis were readily available  it was close to Vivocity  the Sentosa Express. There is a residential area at the back of the hotel with a couple of small food courts  convenience stores.We did not witness any dodgy activity regarding prostitution whatsoever.All reception staff were very friendly  helpful at all times. We would happily stay here again.

<Content>Good for Cheap People Its definitely not a place you want to spend your days in. The room we stayed in was no larger than the bed, and the toilet was in the shower. VERRRY SMALL! Not that we minded. For the traveller that uses the room basically for sleep, it does the trick. Our room was clean. The room is very cheap for Singapore and is within stricking distance of everything with Singapore's excellent transit service. You can take a short (cheap) bust ride to Outram Park MRT where you can connect to anywhere (again for cheap!) There is air conditioning! But, you only get a sheet to sleep under. This hotel only covers the basic necsesities. If you're fine with that, you can save some big $$$. We paid $59CAD/Night.

<Content>BUGS! Pretty decent location. Nice area. Breakfast was neat, as was the one guy cooking it. Receptionist decent, but mediocre. Possible prostitution check-ins might have taken place in lobby...not cool! But my biggest problem of all...was...the...BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You think they are part of the floor, but look closely, they are flat disgusting bugs!!!!! You kill them, and they reappear somehow! We ended up using our nasty towels provided by the hotel as a way to block bugs from crawling under the front door. Also, we had no view. The main window was near the ceiling. The air conditioning worked fine, but stunk. Overall, I did not look forward to coming back to the hotel at night. Although, you pretty much get what you pay for according to the rates in Singapore. I don't think I will be going back again, it's not worth it. I rather splurge and stay comfortably.

<Content>What is get is what you paid I am a grad student living in Chicago who came to Singapore to attend a conference in downtown. I stayed here three nights because other hotels in downtown are quite expensive to afford. I am basically satisfied with the experience because the rate-service balance is what I had expected. What I didn't expected is that this hotel is not only for tourists- A friend of mine who lives in Singapore told me that this hotel is also for men and women who need a room just for several hours. There is a price in this hotel for this kind of short stay. It's so called love hotel.Also, as other people have commented earlier, you would need to have some transportation to get yourself to food courts or shopping or whatever. There is absolutely nothing around the hotel. If you are going to downtown area, it would take extra US$20 per night for commuting if you take taxi, which would be another reason we have to discount the rate that they offer. A taxi driver told me that you can find cheaper hotels in other areas. The thing is, you won't be able to book online; you will have to ask local people. Also, don't book hotels in gaylang area simply because the hotels are cheap unless if you are ok with having prostitutes as your neighbors doing their business. Overall, this is a budget hotel. So if you are looking for better service, search others. In the TripAdvisor ranking I couldn't find other hotels with cheper or same price that delivers more satisfaction ratings. If you do find these, please let evevryone know.Pros1. reasonable rate for reasonable service2. taxis are easy to get3. people at front are ok- at least in my stay4. cleaning comes everydayCons1. Water from shower is not warm enough2. You have to pay internet for S$3 per hour

<Content>Mixed feelings We went to Singapore on a family reunion (we live in different countries), it's me and my parents' first trip to Singapore and I have to say the hotel is a little disappointing. We arrived at around 9pm, my uncle booked 3 rooms and he had already checked in. We went to the front desk and asked the girl if the room for us is available, and this is a beauty, she scribbled a room number on a piece of scrap paper and that was it!! When we asked if my uncle had already checked in, the girl (or should I say B*$tch?) was simply being rude and talked to us as if we were trying to kill her and raise up her arms and repeatly said I don't know anything, I just started my shift. So we went up to the room she gave us, no one was there, had to drag all luggage downstairs and talk to her and got the same treatment, she then proceeded to wrote two other room numbers on another piece of scrap paper, by then I was quite annoyed and asked her what exactly was the room number she gave us, she simply banged a telephone on the counter and asked me to call those rooms! While I was trying to call those 3 rooms she gave us, I saw she got those information from her check in folder! I guess it was too difficult for her to tell me The person made the booking is already here, those are the rooms under his name, please use our internal phone to reach him When we entered the room there were more disappointment, air con not working, tiny room with barely any space, and there weren't even blankets on the bed! Had to went down and talk to the evil witch again, the maintenance man was nice, although the witch told us off for requesting blankets as only 1 per room allowed. Excuse me, didn't know we are not allowed to request basic items that should have been there in the first place.The rest of stay in Singapore was fun, it was very suprising the day shift girls were actually helpful and nice! They were very responsive and extremely friendly. The hotel is not in the CBD, but in Singapore, cab anywhere won't cost you more than 15 - 20 dollars, so if you traveling in groups, make sure you get a taxi. The hotel is very close to Sentosa and taxi only cost about 8 dollars to get there.I guess for the hotel, try not to stay there unless it's MUCH cheaper than anywhere else. We were booked into this hotel because all other CBD hotels were outrageously expensive due to some conference happening in Singapore, even this hotel cost 170+ per night and it was definitely not worth the price you are paying.

<Content>not professional First, did not remember our reservation. Front desk rude. Placed us in a smoking room when we asked for non smoking room. Even non smoking room was smokey. The room is small, but then that's ok right because it's just a place to sleep. But the smoke smell, can't can't can't i repeat, can't breath. shower was good, toilet was bad, had to change roomS. Loud if facing the street side. Internet good. Gym was ok. Breakfast is ok, since it's only ONE older guy cooking for everyone. LOCATION not good, not close to anything. seriously, tho we did use bus. but cost accumulate fast that way. ate meals in chinatowni wouldn't complain about this kind of hotel except that they asked us to pay for a budget hotel as if it's an average cost hotel.

<Content>" Passage to Singapore " from The Natprachas - THAILAND Start your passage from Changi Airport.You can reach this Hotel by Taxi, Limousine, Paid Travel Agent arrangement and MRT. Airport Shuttle can not send you there because they claimed that it is out of bound, they are only take you to City Centre's Hotel. (Eventhough they advertised that they send you anywhere except Sentosa area and Changi Villages ). If you use MRT, take the HarbourFront Line, then, take 143 Bus to the Hotel (Bus stop is nearby the Hotel). The Hotel itself situated between St. Theresa Church  Canadian International School. Meaning, this hotel is in the Residential Area rather than Tourist Disctrict or Business environment ( do not expect to find anything around the Hotel that money can buy-Food ,Drink, Souvenir, etc ) Those who expect some action, light  sound, please do not bother to stay here (but I like) Considering the price you have paid for, this Hotel is good enough (for Singapore Standard and not Thailand-For this price in Thailand, you can easily get a 4 star Hotel) I can say this Hotel is 2+ star but the place is clean, area is safe, staff  Management were friendly, helpful...Room (superior) was not big but enough to move about., Bathroom is surely very small with only shower and no bathtub ( I do not mind ), limitted amenities provided, small towel (not so white colour anymore but fresh  clean) Other was OK EXCEPT : pillows are like a Flat-tire, I had to fold to sleep on it, REfrigerator seem like noone ever touch it for 200 years ( forget about a nice cool drink with ice cube - but they provides Free are; Coffee /Tea Sachets with Kettle and two bottles of Drinking Water) ,NO BLANKET provided and outdated TV reception with mostly local programme, no Radio........ Breakfast included in the room price. For us Asian, its OK, delicious, they have Omelette, Sausages(local), Fried Noodle ( it surely only fried noodle with soy Sauce and no Veggi or meats at all ) and Baked Bean with Bread, butter, Jam, Coffee(local), Tea ( Lipton ), Milk(smell strange) and ice cold drinking water, all are Buffet Style ( I saw a couple of Westerner turn down the breakfast, just had Coffee  left ). for sight-seeing trip, this hotel, for us, is very convenient. We took bus 143 to VivoCity for Monorail to Sentasa ( only less than 10 minutes ) and went by the same bus number 143 to China Town  Newton/Orchard. If you prefer MRT, the nearest one are HarbourFront MRT and Outtram MRT. In general I can rate this as a 4**, Value for Money, Safe  Clean, Friendly and Convenient..All these were good enough for us to decide to stay here when we plan to go to Singapore again next time

<Content>A Room is a Room This is a great place to stay as long as you don't plan on being in your room the whole time - the rooms are small but nicely furnished and the bathrooms are clean. The location is ok - close to Sentosa access but a little further from other attractions such as Chinatown and City Centre - but these are very easily reached by the MRT. If you are planning a holiday where you stay in your room - spring for a place with bigger rooms. Great place to spend the night if only have a quick stop over and money is important!

<Content>Not bad Singapore has always had good expensive hotels and varying degrees of basic hotels. Harbour Ville was not luxury but sounded good. The taxis at Outram MRT station did not know where it was though only a mile away. Luckily I had printed off a map. It might help if you tell them it is next to St Teresa's church, which is what buses 61, 124, 143, 166 recognise the area as. Check-in was friendly and easy. I was disappointed with the room (A super-Queen room means you have a queen-sized bed). It looked quite basic but after four nights in the room, I thought it not bad. I think I had expected too much originally.Daily maid service with fresh towels. Complimentary 500 ml bottle of water daily as well as enough makings for two cups of tea and two of coffee, and a kettle. Complimentary shower gel and shampoo. All important fridge. TV has HBO, 2 sports channels, news, a general channel with films, series, etc. The area is quiet. Door cannot be locked from inside so use do not disturb sign. Air conditioning works a bit too well and I settled on low fan and 30.C as being just right.Hotel has small internet room, gym, laundry. Internet avaialble in rooms extra. Lobby has small snack bar with choice of sandwiches, drinks, noodles.Though not in the centre, regular buses to Outram MRT station and Chinatown just beyond it as well as other places. When returning, be aware that Outram station has a number of exits. I used bus stop across from Pearls Centre (shopping area). Cross the road from the hotel and depending on what bus stop, Vivo City (mall) is only 2-3 stops away (124 does not go there). Buses do not give change and flat fare is 90 cents, or $1 if you do not have change. Hotel will change notes for coins.

<Content>Good value as a transit hotel We stayed here one night on our way back to Perth after a week in Phuket. Good value as a transist hotel. Room very small but didn't smell of smoke. Bathroom small, but clean. You have to be skillful not to spray the toilet with water. Room air conditioned. Nothing in bar fridge, but one bottle of water supplied. For the cost, and the fact we were leaving at 5.00am for our flight home it was more than adequate. A better choice if you can get a booking is IBnb a bed and breakfast, walking distance from this hotel. We walked to the Outram train station from this location. Turn left after leaving the hotel, keep walking to till you reach the T junction, turn right and another 10 minutes you reach the Outram train station. No real complaints, if you want a good price you can't expect top accomodation. One complaintworth noting is that the pillows were very thin. As the rooms are small I would avise going out for tea or something similar and using the room as a spot to sleep.

<Content>Reasonable accomodations I stayed 2 days at the Harbour Ville. The rate was substantially lower then most decent hotels in Singapore and the reviews seemed OK. Check in was quick. When I got to the room, it had a smoke odor. I called the front desk who told me they do not have non-smoking rooms, but promptly sent someone up to spray the room and left an air purifier. That took care of the problem. The room was kind of small, as was the bathroom. But it was very clean and comfortable. There is no clock, so better bring your own. I was on the 8th floor and you could hear the traffic in the street. That is not a problem for me, but maybe to someone not used to it. Also there is a church next door that rings it's bell often.The location is not really convientient to anything. It is a 5-10 minute taxi ride to Chinatown. Taxis are cheap and there is a bus that goes there to. There are no facilities nearby. There is a breakfast in the morning except on Sunday, but it is not very good. The guy in charge seemed to have a grudge.To sum it up, if you are looking for inexpensive, clean accomodations, then the Harbor Ville will work for you. If you want to be pampered, this is not for you.

<Content>Very average: short stay only Very average place. Arrived at 11pm. Reception glanced at my passport - told me I was staying for 2 night - I had in fact booked and pre-paid for 3 nights. Given room key and told which floor it was on. No mention of facilities available.Bedroom measured 3 metres x 3 metres, bathroom was 1 metre wide x 2 metres long. No spare power-points, no international adapter available (bought one for $SG3 at Sim Lim Square).Room price is $SG105 per night off the street, half of that if you book online through an agency. Hotel is too far to walk to or from anywhere - take a taxi - they are prompt and cheap and drivers very talkative and friendly and speak excellent English.The only bonus is room delivery of meals at night.Do not use inhouse Internet: $SG3 an hour!Peter

<Content>Great value in an expensive city Singapore is a beautiful, but expensive town, especially for a budget traveller or backpacker. However the Harbour Ville Hotel, offers good value and is clean and friendly. We paid $40 a night through Asiarooms. It is not luxurious, but doesn't claim to be. Our room, on the 8th floor, had a relatively comfortable bed, tv, fridge and lots of storage space, as well as basic but clean ensuite bathroom. All linens and towels were changed everday and fresh bottles of water are left in the room, along with tea and coffee making facilities. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk (turn right from hotel) from the Harbourfront MRT station, which is also where you can find the huge Vivo city mall, and the entrance to Sentosa. Buses are also plentiful, and go from outside the door. The breakfast is not great, but is edible and there is plenty of it. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, as are most people in Singapore.  Overall I would give this hotel a thumbs up.

The room is bit small, but at least clean and with comportable air conditioning. Staff are friendly and helpful. The only thing which I can't stand is their breakfast, really not healthy and tasty. However, in all, it is a quite a good budget hotel for young travellers to choose.

<Content>Great if you are on a budget After reading reviews we decided to go for it and booked a 10 night stay at the Harbour Ville. For the money we thought it was very good. Because of the earlier reviews we did not expect too much from the breakfasts but did find something we could eat even if its was just toast and jam, the green jam was very interesting. We found local shops in the flats(apartments) at the back of the hotel where food could be bought, there is also a 7-11 store.We had a room at the back of the hotel and apart from some wholesome singing from the church next door it was mostly quiet.There is definitely some sex trade activity though there was never anyone hanging around outside the hotel.All the staff we dealt with were helpful and courteous we did ask for our room to be changed twice, the first one was on the 9th floor we did not look at that one.(We had taken note of problems with noise from Air con plant) Room 2 was on the 6th floor at the front we agreed to stay in it one night because of road noise. Room 3 was at the back, showing its age a bit but very clean, clean sheets, white fluffy towels and cleaned daily.We used the airport shuttle at a cost of S$35 to get from the airport to the hotel, we flagged a taxi down for the return journey this cost S$14.50.We have added this hotel to our list of will do again hotels

<Content>Really Basic Frankly speaking, this is one of the lousiest hotel i've ever stayed in. However, for the price, I supposed I am not in the position to complain. Everything was so basic, the bed was so hard, the blanket was so thin, and any view from the window was non existance. The only plus points I can think of was the bathroom, which was newly renovate. Moreoever, its in the middle of nowhere and you need to take a bus or a taxi to get to the city or the nearest shopping center, Vivocity. I will not recommend this hotel unless you are really tight on budget.

<Content>Great price! Booked this hotel and pre-paid for four nights through Expedia. The furnishing of the room was basic, but both the bedroom and the bathroom were clean. Breakfast is included - don't expect it to be from a first class restaurant, but at least it's hot (as long as you get there before 9:30AM) and not bad for the room rate. It may be slightly out of the way, but several bus routes have stops just steps away from the hotel. On one side of the hotel is a church, and on the other side is the Canadian International School. If you have a room facing the street you will hear heavy duty trucks passing very early in the morning, but that didn't bother us. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Get an E-Link card when you arrive at the airport - even though it has a S$5 non-refundable fee, a substantial discount is given (over single-ticket purchase) on bus and MRT trains.

<Content>Worth the Price This hotel is worth the price you pay for. I got a deal for 4 nights for US$200. Only problem is the location. Way out of town. Harbourfront MRT is not walking distance or 1 km. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel. You can take busses from there to the MRT. Takes about five minutes. If you want to connect to the net in your room, you need to borrow a modem from the front desk which is chargeable by the hour. They have about four to six modems. So sometimes, you may not get the modem when you need it. Also the coin operated laundry - people don't bother to take thier clothes out of the machine when its done. It's just left in the machine and you got to wait until the owner collects it. Very friendly and helpful staff. Clean and comfortable hotel. Definately worth the price. If I am on a tight budget, I will stay there again.

<Content>For the price difficult to fault. Ok so the Harbour Ville is never gonna be in the Sheraton/ Le Meridean league but at twenty quid a night what can you expect?!For the price we paid the Harbour ville delivered.We spent 3 nights in a superior room. The room although not particulary large ,was certainly bigger than the room we had just left in HK. The ensuite bathroom was plenty big enough with powerful shower. The room was clean and tidy with enough space to hang clothes, A mini fridge was included as was obligatory A/C. The front desk staff were always friendly and approachableOnly gripes: 1) A/C unit way too noisy, looked a little outdated.  2)Location a little out of the way but only 拢2 taxi fare  to centre of town.  3) Lousy breakfast, bearly edible.On the whole enjoyed stay there, and very much doubt if equivalent standard of accomodation can be found at such a low price.

<Content>Acceptable experience - Limited parking bays.- Fairly quick and simple check-in.- Sale of sandwiched, drinks and cigarettes in lobby.- 2 lifts, each with its own button. So if you're on the ground floor, and Lift A is at ground floor, and Lift B is on the 5th floor, and you press the button for lift B, you have to wait for Lift B to come down. Lift A won't open for you even if its already oin the ground floor.- $3/hr internet access in room, but did not try.- $1 for 15min using their PC, was simple to use. Celeron 1.8 with 256MB.- The gym consists or a treadmill and 2 stationary bikes- Breakfast is included, but i was not informed of it. No coupon is needed or given.- Breakfast was fried rice, sausages, ommelette, hash, tea/coffee.- Breakfast served outdoors, quite pleasant with the trees, but can get a little warm after 10am.- Room was clean.- Shower leaks.- TV remote control does not work, and nobody came to assist even after complaining.- Mini-fridge takes a long time to get even a can of coke cold. Doesn't help that when you remove your key from the holder near the door, ALL power goes off.- Absolutely no shops in the vincinity! You'd have to drive out, or take a bus/taxi.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed at this hotel for four nights. The service was excellent from all of the staff , Rooms were very clean with big beds and good airconditioning.Bathroom was nice with marble flooring, Do not turn the red switch off in room or you will have no hot water. The hotel was handy to a large stunning shopping centre called vivo city, and close to sentosa island where its full of beautiful tropical beaches. Its not close to orchard road but you can catch bus to vivo city or walk [10-15mins approx] the catch the train anywhere. There is broadband internet available in you room if you have you laptop for a cost of 3sgd per hour. I used it and it worked very fast and when i had a difficulty the were more than happy to help me over the phone from reception. We stayed in the superiour room which had a bigger bed and more space. The breakfast wasn`t flash but it had all you needed and the man who cooked it was pleasant. No breakfast on sundays.Would love to stay again.

<Content>Clean and friendly We were hesitant to book here because the hotel isn't really near anything, but hours of searching turned up nothing under S$150 that I would take my family to. So we booked. And the place if fine.We liked:-Very clean.-Friendly and relaxed staff. Not hung up on a bunch of hotel policies-Everything in the room worked.-Price (under S$100), hard to find a decent place in this range.We didn't like:-In room internet requires borrowing a modem from the desk, using it, bringing it back and then charged for the time you borrowed it. I'd recommend getting the internet full-time in the rooms.-It is true there's not so much as a convenience store you can walk to, but - there is a bus stop out front and I don't think we ever waited more than two minutes for a taxi.-Small room.-A bit of a musty odor in the room, but the A/C worked well and it went away quick.Would I stay here again? Possibly. If I could find a decent place closer in town at the same or just a little more then I would take it, but failing that I would have no problems returning here.

<Content>Decent budget accommodation My wife and I stayed here for several days in March, 2007. I booked this hotel on Expedia as it received fair reviews and was quite cheap for Singapore.It is not within convenient walking distance from any of the touristy sites in Singapore, however, is very near a bus stop and is about 5 stops from Chinatown. Also, it gets regular taxi traffic if one prefers that mode of getting around. It is also fairly near the Harbourfront station area. Bus service in Singapore was 90 cents (Singapore) per person/per trip, which is quite cheap and several routes pass by the hotel. We used the bus service to get around while staying at Harbour Ville and they have the numbers of the busses that pass by their hotel on their business cards for your convenience.The rooms are small, but the AC works well and there was adequate hot water. The bathrooms are also small and the toilet areas tend to share real estate with the shower. Each room has a small TV that gets about 4-5 stations incl. a movie channel.Breakfast is served every day except Sunday and includes coffee/tea/juice, fried hot dog, cold baked beans, scrambled egg, toast with jam and peanut butter and possibly fried potato.Staff there were courteous and business-like, but don't expect to be romanced!A cabbie pointed out to us that the hotel has a reputation for some prostitution traffic, however, this wasn't as issue during our stay although we did see a woman who appeared to be on the job at about 1 AM. Certainly, this is at least partially due to the fact that the hotel is across the street from the industrial harbour area where ships load and unload and there are probably some visitors in town in there with some needs for female attention!Again, our rooms were quiet on our two seperate stays here, however. I suspect whatever traffic of that nature the hotel might get is reserved for floors other than where longer term occupants might be staying. I just thought this was important to note. We saw numerous Chinese and Malay tourists staying there while we were there.For our needs, this accommodation was perfectly fine and allowed us to save some money on our overhead while in Singapore.I would recommend Harbour Ville to those on a budget who don't mind taking the bus and having a small room when they travel.

<Content>What a Great Budget Hotel! Certainly a budget hotel with open air parking for about 8 cars, 2 elevators servicing 13 rooms per floor, about 10 floors.I booked a four day stay with my wife and 2 kids by calling the hotel directly. I did this even if it cost me about US$20/night more than booking through Expedia or the like for 2 reasons: firstly - to verify that there would be no extra charges for 4 of us staying in 1 room (2 twin beds); secondly - to make sure that my reservation was verified and wouldn't get mixed up as some other reviewers claimed.We got our room on the 8th floor. It had 2 twin beds, a TV, a miniref, a small closet with 3 hangers but no dresser / cabinet. The bathroom was as expected, a bit bigger than usual I guess, but there is no shower divider - just a depression in the corner. They do however give you floor towels now, so no need to use a bath towel on the floor.Beware the red light! We accidentally turned off the switch beside the red light when we left the room, which shut off the water heater - it takes about 30 minutes build up a store of hot water again.Also, pulling the key holder from the wall switch shuts off the power to the whole room, including the ref. Good thing the kids milk in the ref didn't go bad while we were away. This is probably a common feature, but it was almost a whoopsy.We henceforth took the key of the holder, left the holder in the wall switch and did our touring with the key on our key ring (keep the Do Not Disturb sign on your door if you do this).The room was a long thin rectangle, not too spacious but everything fit, and we weren't there to enjoy the room. The room was very clean however, and more so the bathroom.The lobby is really small, with chairs to the far left, the front desk to your left, elevators to the right and sandwich display case to the far right.There's a small verandah out back where they serve breakfast - no room service.The hotel staff was courteous, polite, knowledgeable and helpful. For instance, we asked for the room to be cleaned up at 5pm, not the regular cleanup time. They came by in 15 minutes and swept up. On leaving, the lady at the front desk got up, went to the curb and called us a cab.Don't expect any eateries too close to the hotel, but a 10 min. walk takes you to Vivo City / Sentosa Bridge / Harbour Fronte Centre / MRT-NE1 whre you will find more than enough to feed you and your loved ones. In the other direction 10 min. walk along Kampung Bahru, across from the Singapore General Hospital there are a few of the famous food stalls.All in all, a great budget hotel. We'd gladly stay there again - and do without the additional family room / guest charges other hotels may levy.

<Content>Basic hotel, Fair for the price, A little out of the way This is a fair hotel for the price. We got two nights for 88 USD. At online reservation, you pay 10% and the rest on arrival.Room is modest but not cramped (for Asians, large Westerners may have trouble). Initially had slight mouldy odor but went away after aircon was turned on, possibly due to incense being used outside the hotel. Linen clean but slightly worn. Had TV but only about seven channels, one with HBO. Bathroom functional with shower, but small. Breakfast aceptable to us, basic eggs, sausage, hash brown, tea and coffee, but might be spare for some people.Location a little out of the way. One bus ride (#124 or #143) from Outram MRT (or apparently anywhere on the N-S MRT route) will put you down right in front of the hotel. If you're out late, MRT and bus will stop after 12, and a taxi is about 5-7 Sing dollars from Orchard. No nearby 7-11 or similar shops. However, place very safe and quiet.Service fair to quite good.
