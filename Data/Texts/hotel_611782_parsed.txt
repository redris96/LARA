<Content>Great Experience! I liked the hospitality of the hotel staff very much. It is very conveniently-located. The hotel is situated in a walkable proximity from the tram station. In the evenings, the square is full with activities of local artisans and people taking their time off for a drink. The hotel staff was quite co-operative and helpful. The rooms were small but cozy and were kept quite neat and tidy. The breakfast is complementary with the room charges. The only difficulty was the narrow and steep staircase, which scares someone with luggage of falling down :)Otherwise, a nice place to stay.

<Content>On the spot Stayed at the hotel for a few days while trippin' and doing the bussines in the city.The hotel itself is small and cozy so if you're looking for something exclusive and trendy - pick another place. The people at the desk is friendly and helpful. When needed to get some adresses and directions - they pointed me them out. The hotel is really easy to find and it's maybe 25min of light wolk from central station. You can enjoy the Amsterdam on your way to and from the airport (if got light laguage). As it's next to Leidsplein so you have louds of atractions next to the door or in a short walking distance.The rooms are small and cozy. Can't say anything about the steep stairs as got the same at home so no worries for me even it was 3am. Sadly that BBC wasn't always included on TV (dunno why) so had to choose between CNN, MTV and TMF what wasn't so bad though. Sadly there's something beeing builded next to the hotel so the noise in the morning is a bit annoying but not so bad. Bathroom small but spaceiuos enough to be in. The breakfast room downstairs is really cozy and the breakfast itself are nice. Or if you want to eat in the city - you can always do that!Even the hotel was fully booked but rarely could hear your 'neighbours' unless they been climbing the stairs too noisy.In general - small and cozy hotel for those who's looking for a nice stay without problems

<Content>Great Value I booked this place because the hotel I normally stay in was getting a bit to expensive, so with that I mind I was expecting trhis place to be a down grade. I was very pleasantly surprised.On this trip I was travelling solo and received a warm welcome at the hotel. My room was basic but very clean, and that's the most important thing to me. The only downside was that my room faced the street and the bar across the road got quite noisey at night. On my second night I decided that if you can't beat em you might as well join em - and I went across the road, met some travellers and had a really good laugh.The location is great, close to Leidesplein, which is my favourite place to stay in Amsterdam. Good breakfast also included in the price which is the best way to start off a busy day in Amsterdam.

<Content>The Best This was our second stay at the Hotel Freeland. We were returning to Amsterdam with my parents and there was no where else I would stay in Amsterdam than with the gang at the Hotel Freeland. The rooms are spacious and clean. The breakfast is excellent and fills you up so you are good to go until the late afternoon. The location cannot be beat. It is down the street from the Leidesplein, where there are outdoor cafes/ bars and a metro stop. However, you do not hear any of the noise at the hotel. There is free internet downstairs in the lobby. Are the steps steep, yes, but this is Amsterdam, they are all this way. Take it slow and by the third time doing it, you will be a pro. What makes this hotel especially stand out, is the staff. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Aside from the very very late night/early morning hours, the front desk is always open and there is always someone there to help or to simply provide a warm greeting. There is also coffee and tea and tables set up in the front room and outside. The owners are beyond compare. Having traveled in the US and abroad and stayed at many hotels both extravagant and modest, I have never encountered customer service like the Freeland. We were trying to book four train tickets to Paris (our next stop)and there was a special internet rate (1/2 off tickets) that we were unable to book while in the US because you needed a Dutch billing address. We explained the situation to the fantastic owners Rick and Pascale over email and asked if they had any ideas to help us out. Without our even asking, they purchased our tickets for us and when we offered to wire the money to them, they refused and said to simply wait until we get there. Even when we got there, they said no problem wait until we check out. It was an absoiute pleasure to stay there and I would highly recommend it, for the location, the cleaniess and spaciousness of the rooms, and most of all the people.

<Content>EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS I was tempted not to write this review when I saw how many other recent guests at the hotel had written their rave reviews of this delightful small hotel but, in the end, I wanted to add my voice in praise of Rick  Pascale and their well-run establishment. Some earlier reviews were critical of the steep stairs but I long ago realized that if you are going to stay in one of these small hotels in Amsterdam which had been converted from a private home, steep staircases and no elevators are the norm. My advice to travellers is not to take so much stuff when they travel - lighter luggage!. This was my third visit to Amsterdam. In the past I stayed at an elegant canal-side hotel on one of the grander canals - expensive and since my visit under new management and with a new name - and then in a cheaper rambling place in a big apartment building between Westerkirk and Dam Square - not very satisfactory! I hesitated about booking at the Freeland knowing how close it was to busy, boozy Leidseplein it was but my fears were unfounded. It is close, just around the corner and less than a block away, but you wouldn't know it. The hotel is also firmly rooted in the Jordaan, which is, in my opinion, the best part of this tidy little city. Walk one way and there are bars and restaurants and shops aplenty (also tram stops including the one that will take you back into the historic centre and onto Central Station). Walk the other way and see how ordinary Amsterdamers live, and walk, and walk. The service is very personal at the Freeland but also very professional, starting with its owners Rick and Pascale who live next door and extending to all the staff at the front desk, in house keeping, and in the breakfast room (where you can begin your day with a substantial meal). The atmosphere is casual and friendly but this doesn't detract from the high level of service provided. I stayed here at the begining and then at the very end of a recent trip to Europe and discovered to my surprise just how happy I felt when I got back at the end to feel myself at home again and greeted like a valued old friend. The rooms (the ones I stayed in) were small (But more-than-adequate); the stairs are steep (Pack lightly); and the experience was entirely satisfactory.

<Content>5* for staff service and hospitality I have travelled since I was 17 and gave myself this trip as my 60th birthday gift. I have stayed in the cheapest places in many corners of the world and in 5* hotels but NEVER experienced such hospitality, service and friendlines such as the staff of Freeland. I was welcomed with a birthday greeting and a gift ! There was always time for a smile, a cup of coffee and a chat. I was supposed to check out at 10.30 a.m. but had mixed up the date of my departure ! Returned early evening from the city and realised that I had to leave for my plane in 30 minutes ! Since a new visitor had come to check in, the staff had stored all my luggage in the kitchen and looked after it the whole day. They just told me to relax, have a coffee and were extremely nice and phoned for a taxi to take me to the airport - and they did not even charge me extra for anything which of course they had been fully entitled to. I can certainly recommend this hotel to anybody. It may be rated 2* but the staff deserves a proper 5* !!! Don麓t hesitate, you will never regret to book this hotel ! Dorith, Denmark

<Content>Freeland Hotel Exceeded My Expectations I stayed at the Freeland for two weeks during April 2008. The Freeland Hotel is special mostly because of the helpful, friendly, and warm staff and owners. The Freeland鈥檚 quiet and exceptional location is a fantastic bonus, as is the Freeland鈥檚 consistent cleanliness.For the price, the Freeland is worth every cent! The breakfast is excellent. And the helpfulness and knowledge of Amsterdam 鈥?whether shopping or viewing the arts 鈥?by the multilingual staff is top notch.Thank you Barbara, Pascale, and Rick for helping make my Amsterdam visit very, very special!

<Content>Nice Stay My wife and I stayed at the hotel Freeland March 22nd - 25th. It was very easy to find from the tram stop at Leidseplein. Let me say that the stairs are very steep. Our first two nights we were on the very top floor and after becoming winded going up the stairs numerous times we asked and they put us in a room on the second floor. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful and answered all of our questions and gave us recommendations on things to do in the area. The location is great, a short walk from restaurants, pubs and numerous coffeeshops (CS Crush is across the street). The breakfast was good and they will make you a cup of coffee anytime you wish. They also have free internet access which was useful for checking e-mails and keeping in touch with family and friends. For a good meal I would recommend Puri Mas, which is an Indonesain Restaurant about two blocks from the hotel. For a beer I would go to Cafe de Koe which is across the street and to the left abot 100 yards. For coffeeshops there is the Crush right next door to Cafe de Koe, The Rokerij, Noon, the Dolphin, La Tertulia and several others all within a short walk from the hotel. I would definitely return but would ask for a lower level floor as the stairs are more like a ladder which is typical for buildings in Amsterdam.

<Content>A very enjoyable hotel to stay at. At first, I was apprehensive of climbing all of the Dutch style stairs. The hotel is for the physically fit, especially of your room is on one of the upper floors. We had a very large twin room. It was large by even big name hotels. THe matrasses were great. THe room was spotless. The continental breakfast was ample. While there is street construction, it did not bother us. We left the hotel by 9 AM and returned after 9 PM. All of the staff was very helpful. I suggest the hotel to the your crowd for the above reason. THe staff was always helpful, offering us coffee and being just pleasant.

<Content>"Most comfortable bed in all of Europe, and more..." What a great place to stay! My wife and I stayed for three nights at the Freeland on our honeymoon and had the best experience of all time in a European boutique hotel on a budget. (Btw, we go to Europe three times a year searching for travel bargains.) Our friendly, sexy host Pascale was very hospitable and very helpful in every way. Extra pillows? No problem. Corkscrew? Here try some of this wine. Daily breakfast was a modest continental fare featuring a hard-boiled egg with a selection of pastries, deli style meats and cheeses. It's fast, lite and no fuss. Perfect. Full English breakfast with beans is a popular staple and found easily for around 12Euros just down the street. The hotel's proximity to Leidseplein is unrivalled. City-wide transit is just 50 metres away. The Paradiso theatre, Museums, Heineken experience, liquor and grocery stores plus hundreds of restaurants and bars are all five to ten minutes walk away. The prestigious Hotel Americain is just a stone's throw. Next to it you can board a boat for a guided canal tour. If you want to sample some of the more unique temptations on offer in the red light district, it's less than ten minutes on the tram or twenty minutes walk to all of the dope and debauchery anyone can deal with. The flower market and historic Dam square are on the way. There were some downsides that are out of the owner's hands. There was construction going on down the block. (There is a new Opera house going up nearby.) And, there are five floors and no elevator. But, if you are familiar with Holland at all you already understand that most row houses in Amsterdam are very tall and built around tall, narrow staircases. People with mobility challenges wouldn't find this hotel very easy to navigate unfortunately. (There is a Marriott and a Crowne plaza right around the corner featuring accessible accommodations.) I would recommend this hotel to any young people who are looking for a soft bed on a hard budget. Next time in Amsterdam, we will definitely stay there again. Cheers

<Content>Not for us We arrived for a three night stay but initial impressions were enough to tell us that it wasn't for us. The cat sitting on the table may be cute to some people but it doesn't appeal to me. The room overlooked an unkempt overgrown area at the back. The room and whole hotel looks very shabby and extremely basically furnished. The main thing that put us off was the musty smell as soon as we entered the room, and the deeply soiled carpets. The room had been cleaned and linen etc looked clean but it is way past needing a change of carpet, washed net curtains and a few Euro spent on furnishing.It may suit if you are loooking for a very basic place to get your head down. Personally I would't recommmend it. We picked up our suitcases, paid for one night and left immediately.

The room is very basic - but clean (will take this over a posh but dirty space any day). Free internet service. Good breakfast each morning. Rick and team were just great. They have earned their good reputation and I would absolutely stay there again.

<Content>NIce place and friendly staff. To make a long story short...... I was in disterss because I was looking for a hotel after having a really bad experience at another hotel, thats when I stumbled upon The Freealand. I rang the doorbell and a bery polite man answered and let me see the room that was available. It was very cute it had a sun room , a private bathrrom, and a bath tub. I told him I would take the room. After my friend and I settled in the staff gavew us a beer (boy did I need one) There is a vending machine with soda, water and beer. There is free breakfast and free internet. I loved the staff. The are very, very helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is clean, convinient and safe.

<Content>Very good value Booked this hotel for a friend and myself, when we turned up we had been allocated a double bed rather than a twin bed. The hotel was full so the owner arranged for us to stay in the building next door, this appeared to be a private residence, it was perfectly adequate and we appreciated the effort.Breakfast was the usual European fare of boiled eggs, meat and cheeses.Location was good just near Leidseplein and Amsterdam is so small you could walk anywhere in 30 minutes

<Content>Two seniors very well pleased We had a fantastic three day break at the Freeland Hotel. We shared a twin bedded room on the 2nd floor with a balcony complete with flag! Stairs, although plentiful, were not a problem and we accepted them as a true characteristic of Dutch houses. Owners and Staff were extremely friendly, helpful and had a terrific sense of humour. The location was excellent and we enjoyed many wonderful sights, including a trip to the Keukenhof Gardens arranged by hotel staff. A break from walking was to board the hop on/hop off canal boats from which to take in the ambience of the city. Well worth another visit.

<Content>Great place to stay. We have just returned from a 3 night break staying at this hotel. There was 4 of us all together(2 sets of couples).We have stayed at other hotels in Amsterdam, but this is what we thought of this:The hotel is great value for money, location is excellent, with the majority of places being within walking distance (museums, dam square, red light district, shops, markets, bars and clubs), if you do want to venture further afield then the trams provide an excellentservice.This is typical dutch building, tall and narrow, and because of this has plenty of stairs!!! If you have problems walking I would suggest contacting the hotel to request a ground floor, the breakfast is served in the basement so there would still be the stairs to go down there but at least you would not have to climb to go to your room.Rooms are clean and tidy and ours both had en-suites which were basic shower rooms, again these were clean and tidy, clean towels are provided and any dirty ones you leave on the floor will be replaced daily as the rooms are cleaned and beds made.The staff are very friendly and are on hand to provide help with anything you need to know about Amsterdam.Overall:Great hotel, great location, friendly staff, clean  tidy and all for a reasonable price.Dont go expecting the Ritz or Hilton, be realistic. This hoel provides everything you need. We will definatly be visiting again soon.

<Content>Hotel Hell! Stayed here last fall after seeing reviews online. We were very excited to give it a try after emails with the owners. It was the worst hotel we have stayed at in Amsterdam! The room was shabby and not well-tended. One day, we left early for a day trip and returned home to find the room not made up and the towels were not changed. The surly evening desk clerk initially refused to give us fresh towels and said it was our fault as we obviously did not let the room cleaners in the room. From that point on, it was very uncomfortable with one of the owners. For the money they charge, one would think that one would receive better value/service for the money.
