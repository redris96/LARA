<Content>Farewell Palace Hotel We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Palace Hotel and got a great rate at $280US per night. The room was spacious with marvelous views of the Imperial Palace from our room and the penthouse lounge. It was bittersweet knowing that the original Palace building is slated for demolition, to be replaced by 2012. The lobby had an exhibition of its history with profiles of the chef and bartender as well as famous guests. There were also mementos of uniforms, dinnerware and special exterior bricks. The location is near the subway and train station so getting around town was simple. We are delighted to have experienced a piece of history in the old Palace before it is replaced. Thank you Palace Hotel, Tokyo.Rose Marie Pratt

<Content>Love the location I holidayed while my husband was there for work. The location worked for us pretty well as he walked to work while I used the metro which is about 1-2 mins walk to explore Tokyo. It is very convenient as the major lines pass through Otemachi station.  The hotel is a nice and quiet place to come back to after a day of exploring the buzzling city. The view of the Imperial Palace which greeted us first thing in the morning was lovely too.We stayed for 6 nights and throughout the stay, we have no complaints. The rooms were spacious, clean and well-kept and the staff were all polite and helpful. I remembered requesting the receptionist to book a day tour (for 8am the next day) at midnight and the staff contacted the travel agent to make all the arrangements.The restaurants do not appeal to us but that's not a problem as we tend to eat out at other places in Tokyo before taking a late train back.It's a shame they have plans to tear down and rebuild the hotel which was opened in the 1960s. Will miss the quaint place and will try to visit before they tear it down next Jan.

<Content>Great Base for the Imperial Garedens The Palace Hotel is a lovely base if you want to view the Gardens in the Imperial Palace.It has beautiful rooms that suprisingly are decked out with Victorian Decor. The rooms are quite large and they have very comfortable beds. The Bathroom is rather large compared to any bathroom at a traditional japanese hotel. The toiletries are very nice and there are plenty.The breakfast in the Swann Restaurant is very nice, it has a good combination of Western and Japanese foods and there is plenty of fresh beautiful fruit. And the service is fantastic.All in all it is a lovely hotel that is a great base to start your trip in Japan, however be aware that it is not very close to the hussle and bussle of Ginza, Shinjuku or Harajuku.

<Content>Ok hotel We have just reurned from Japan. Our agent booked a double non smoking room. It was tiny, the bathroom tiny and the view was non existent. After a fuss we were offerd a much larger room on a high floor but it was a smoking room which although didnt smell too bad still had a faint whiff. The bathroom was much bigger and a king size bed. The location is in a very quiet part of Tokyo with not too many shops or restaurants. it is in need of updatingWe were very disappointed wit it. brakfast was ok, rather limited but ok.

<Content>Very good value Tokyo is an expensive city. i am very happy i found this hotel which offers very good value in the context of Japan. The room are rather large for this city. They are not super luxurious but offer good quality. The location is excellent. Although it is in the business district, it is also next to the Imperial palace and close to a subway station where many lines pass.

<Content>Clean but outdated My husband and I stayed at the Palace Hotel in Tokyo for 5 nights last Nov. 07, and were disappointed. The hotel  room were very clean, and we even received a welcome fruit platter. But for the price, we expected a notch or two higher! Since we used to live in Japan, we go there quite often, and have stayed at various hotels in Tokyo. To give you an idea, we especially love the Westin in Ebisu (now they are polite too). If we had known, we would have gladly paid $100 more to stay at another more updated or new hotel. The bed is relatively comfortable, but a little stiff, old, and nothing luxurious at all, and the same can be said for the rest of the furniture (old). And the building is pretty old too - looks grayish from the outside. When we told them that we did not like the room, they told us that they already gave us the best room they had for the room level (Executive Superior). I just think the price is too high for the room quality.

<Content>A view of the Imperial Palace We stayed here two nights at the end of June, 2007. It is located right next to the Imperial Palace so the East Garden of the Palace is just across the street. It is close to the Maranouchi buildings with their many restaurants and shops. It is also centrally located for the Metro. Our room had a view of the Palace wall and moat. The room has the amenities expected of a four star hotel including free internet in the room. However, our room (a superior deluxe) only had 12 free television channels. I did not find the room to be dated, but clean and nicely furnished. In contrast to some comments, I did not think the buffet breakfast was as good as others we have had in Asia or even in South America and the service was hap hazard in contrast to our experience in other parts of the hotel. The limousine to Narita Airport stops at the Palace which is convenient if you have luggage

<Content>Huge room with wonderful views and amazing bed Service is not what you are used to in Japan however the guestroom is huge, in-room amenities amazing and the bed is 2 x 4 meters (yes two meters in length and 4 meters in width). The balcony -large- overlooking Imperial Palace and Gardens is fantastic. Would definitely return.

<Content>Very Good We booked 2 rooms  they kindly reserved 2 connecting rooms one upgraded to higher standard than paid for, both rooms were of a good size. As with most things in japan the rooms were well kept despite their age  the service was impecable. The Hotel is close to both the rail  underground stations(15 mins by train to disney!) in addition is set in the palace grounds so very quiet. The only negatives are that being in the office district there is limited shopping / eating within walking distance , there a lots of restraunts in the hotel although very expensive and TV channels were very limited(10 approx -9 in Japanese) not what we expect internationally. I would definitely stay here again as I have young kids(quiet) but would recommend a hotel in a more lively area for younger couples seeking more nightlife/shopping.

<Content>great location and terrific small gym Stayed at the Palace for 4 nights in single room. Stayed here a few years ago. Very comfortable and very clean, if somewhat dated bathroom. The room itself was very nice and modern. Helpful staff. There is a small but excellent gym at the hotel, with life fitness products (treadmills, eliptical and bikes) all in new condition. The gym is extra clean. Fantastic area; across from the Imperial Palace, walk to the Ginza, 2 blocks from Tokyo Station. Breakfast at the hotel is average for Tokyo. Lot of excellent restaurants and starbucks in neighboring office complexes. Free broadband access.

<Content>Tokyo's Best At least in my humble opinion, this is Tokyo's best hotel. It is a great location, with amazing grounds and amenities. It is an oasis of calm in one of the craziest cities in the world.The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. I forgot my charger for my laptop and they had one for me in 15 minutes (thank God I have a sony!) so I could finish some work after a long day in the air.I love the public spaces and restaurants, they are elegant without being ostentatious.

<Content>Loved the Palace Although I stayed only one night in this hotel, it was a very pleasant and wonderful experience after staying in two other not as wonderful hotels in Hokkaido. The welcome was warm and the porter who carried our bags to our room was kindly. I liked the fact that service was provided without expectations of gratuities or tips. Before going to the room, I asked the counter staff whether I need to tip the porter. She looked shocked and was taken aback and kept saying...No, No.... The room was luxurious and big with a king-sized bed and our room overlooked the Imperial Gardens. The view was nice and from our room, we could see a very graceful ,solitary, white swan gliding across the moat. There are some restaurants in the hotel serving various food, including a Chinese restaurant. We took the buffet breakfast, which was quite good. The counter staff recommended some places of interest that we could visit in our short stay there. We were told to make use of the free city bus which stops regularly in front of the hotel to the Ginza area and to some shopping areas nearby and near the Tokyo Station. This hotel would be very convenient for travellers coming in or out of Narita Airport as there is an airport limousine direct to and from the hotel. It costs 3000 yen per person each way. However, for travellers coming in from Haneda airport , one could still take the airport limousine to Tokyo Station and from there either walk for about 10 minutes to the hotel or take a taxi to the hotel. We paid about 650 yen for the taxi ride from the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station to the hotel, as we had 2 heavy bags. One plus point is that there is a subway station very near to the hotel.

<Content>Thumbs up for Palace Hotel The choice of excellent hotels in Tokyo appears to be endless, but if we go to Tokyo again we will stay once more at the Palace.My wife and I stayed at The Palace Hotel from June 2 until June 6 this year. While more expensive than a regular room, we opted for the 鈥淐ity Breaks鈥?package with an Executive Superior room facing the Imperial Palace. Our room did not exactly face the Palace, but rather faced part of the Palace grounds looking south toward The Tokyo Tower. Before settling down after checking in, I requested a look at a west facing room which did have a view of the Palace. All that could be seen was a bit of the Palace roof. In addition, the afternoon sun was so bright that it was necessary to keep the drapes closed to avoid extreme glare. We therefore stayed in the south facing room.We thought the hotel was great. Our room was very large, as was the bathroom with its separate shower. The toilet was typical Japanese high tech with its heated seat and other 鈥渂ells and whistles鈥? The benefits of the 鈥淐ity Breaks鈥?package included breakfast each morning and visits to the frequent guests鈥?clubroom each evening before diner. The breakfast buffet was good, if not great. The ninth floor clubroom was particularly enjoyable due to the presence of the hostess. She fixed a fine drink and in addition was very interesting to talk with. She had lived in San Francisco for a few years until she finished seventh grade in the public schools there. Her English was better than mine. She also knew a great deal about world history. We had light diners in the caf茅s on the lower level of the hotel three nights during our stay. The smoked duck breast in the Irish Pub was very good. Other meals were satisfactory.Our sightseeing was limited. The most extensive, rather rigorous, day was with a Goodwill Guide. These are Japanese who will go with you to show you some of the Tokyo sights. There is no cost other than their expenses. Our lady guide was great and we had a good, if a bit exhausting, time that day. Other days we took a tourist bus around central Tokyo one afternoon, and another afternoon walked across the street to the Imperial Palace Gardens. Others have commented that this hotel is not close to much activity. That may be true, but there is a free bus which stops at the hotel and then goes around some of central Tokyo, stopping at several locations, including the train station.Here are a couple of final thoughts. We took the train from Kyoto to Tokyo. That was made easier by using a luggage transfer service from our Kyoto hotel, the Hyatt, to The Palace. By getting the large luggage sent from Kyoto before 4:00 pm the day prior to our train, it was waiting for us when we checked into The Palace the next day. We avoided having to handle that luggage to, on, and off the train.Instead of taking the rapid train to Narita Airport for travel home, we took the bus which stopped at the hotel, loaded all our luggage, and supplied a comfortable ride to the airport in an hour and a half. The bus also stops at other hotels.

<Content>A very nice hotel. This is a really nice, friendly hotel. Not 5 star perhaps, but the service is excellent. The gym is really good for a hotel this size and is never busy, most evenings I had the 3 treadmills, two bikes, cross-trainer and loads of weights machines to my self. They've even got a Swiss Ball area, and a blood-pressure machine!The breakfast buffet is large, fresh and varied. As with most of Tokyo the restaurants close fairly early (9.30) but quick room service is available 24 hours.Very hard to fault this hotel, and its location next to the Palace gardens means it is away from the madness of the Skyscaper district, and nice serene walks or jogs are possible even during rush hour. Look out for the turtles in the pond by the terrace.

<Content>Good, friendly hotel I was in Tokyo to attend a convention and so picked this hotel as its location was very nearby to the venue and it also seemed very positively regarded here on TripAdvisor. I was very pleased with the stay I had. The staff were indeed very friendly and helpful, the food was good across the two in-house restaurants I tried, the room was large enough and very well-equipped and the nearby underground station allowed me easy access to the subway system which wwas able to take me easily to various other parts of the city.I was after a nice, clean and comfy place to rest after a day's work and an evening's exploration of the city and this fit that bill nicely.Would definitely stay again.

<Content>Very pleasant hotel, fills a particular niche The people and personal service was the best part of this very elegant hotel. I agree in some way with all of the reviews on this page, although they disagree with one another. This is a financial district, and not a good location for restaurants or nightlife (the hotel's restaurants are underwhelming). However, it's very close to the Tokyo train station. Anyone coming into Tokyo from Narita to change trains would be well-advised to stop here.The rooms are in fact very large and comfortable for Japanese hotels. Travelocity was able to give me a room rate that was at least 20% cheaper than comparable Tokyo hotels. There was a beautiful view, and the hotel is across the street from the entrance to the Imperial Palace gardens, which are free even if you don't have a reservation to get into the palace.

<Content>Central Location Istayed at the Palace Hotel in Tokyo with my wife March 07. My wife was there for work I was ther for pleasure,so the hotel worked great for both of us. It was close to the main buisness district for her and it was centrally located for myself. The rooms were nice they were average size,but the bathrooms were very nice. The staff was very friendly ,most spoke some english and some probably better than I do. It had several restaurants and bars, some of the restaurants were a little pricy,but not to much more than any other place in Tokyo. The beers in the bars were about $8.00 each, but once again an average price in Tokyo. There is a subway station entrance about a block and a half from the hotel, exit from the side of the hotel by the exercise room and turn right. If you plan on going from one area to the next as I did you might want to buy a day or week pass on the subway. The Imperial Palace is across the street and is worth walking around if you have the time. The hotel also has a bus service from the airport to the hotel I think it was about $30.00 ea., but worth it because the airport is about 60 min. away. To sum things up , it was a very nice hotel,I felt a little out of place ( everyone else was in suits and I was in shorts and T-shirt). Very classy, very friendly, great location I would definitly stay there again. Can't wait to go back , I LOOOOOOOOOVED Tokyo and I bet you will too whether your going for buisness or pleasure.

<Content>Not worth the money Not overly impressed for the money. We booked it for the first day in Japan as it was central and comfortable - somewhere to get over the jet lag! A rather dated hotel by Japanese standards - looks very late 70s / early 80s. Was quite a lot of money - we subsequently got much better value for money in the Dai-Ichi hotel which was half the price and twice as good.

<Content>Best Hotel in Tokyo I booked my hotel last August based on some of the reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel was beyond my ability to express. I was in Tokyo with my wife and two daughters. The hotel room was clean, comfortable and had English TV.The staff was very helpful. The concierge was from Germany and was able to give us great tips on taking the subway. It is really not that confusing. Big, but not confusing.On the last day, we took a taxi back to the hotel. We were heading for Beijing. I bought a ticket on the bullet train to the airport at the hotel. We decided to walk to the Tokyo train station a few blocks away. As we were entering Tokyo train station, I heard my name being called out. Never having been in Tokyo, I was taken aback. Unbenkownst to me, we left our digital camera in the taxi. The driver noticed it and returned it to the hotel. The hotel then sent out several staff to attempt to catch us before we left.It was close to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and the staff was sweating and one woman was in high heals. I left with very fond memories of Tokyo and the staff at the Palace hotel

<Content>A great hotel I am writing this review on my last evening staying here in the Palace Hotel. It is a great hotel. The rooms are tidy and have a nice character to them. The staff are extremely helpful - one of the receptionists spent half an hour and several phone calls to find a place I was trying to get to in Tokyo without making me feel unwelcome at any time. The breakfast is nice too and the hotel has a shopping Arcade with restaurants as well as a fitness centre. It is very close to the JR Tokyo and the metro Otemachi stations so you can get to any place in Tokyo. Of course, the Imperial Palace is a stone's throw away. And, of course, I am using the complementary internet connection in my room to write this review :) And do try out the massage place on the basement floor. The massage is absolutely heavenly - a great way to get over that tired feeling from the jetlag.
