<Content>Excellent Business Hotel This is an excellent hotel if you are on business in this part of Paris. The rooms are spacious with a separate work area and free internet access. Unlike other reviewers I have never had any problems with the internet access. The rooms have tea/coffee making facilities as well as a mini bar.I think the breakfast is pretty good, but I agree with the comments previously made about the poor quality of the scrambled eggs ! The bar and restaurant are expensive so it is best to go elsewhere in the neighbourhood or into the centre of Paris. The metro is close by and the Champs D'Elyesee is about 20 minutes away. However, taxis in Paris are cheap and good value compared to most European cities.

<Content>Good Hotel Was booked in as part of a large group staying at the hotel. Check-in was very quick and easy - staff were friendly. Thought the rooms were very modern and clean. Luckily we weren't visiting Paris as tourists - since as mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is located a long distance from main Paris and all the tourist attactions.

<Content>Dissapointed with the Radisson - 3* at best Having secured a good deal on Ebay, which resulted in paying less than 96 Euros a night including breakfast, my expectations were not huge, as I counted anything at this price in Paris as a bonus!However, having stayed in many Radissons before, coupled with its 4 star rating, it is fair to say, that we were not expecting something basic - which is sadly what we got.To begin with, check in was not smooth, and the problems already started through the repeated requests on the telephone and via email in receiving a written confirmation of our room. Upon check in, the room that was allocated to us was filled with stale smoke, despite asking repeatedly for a non-smoking room. This was quickly and professionally dealt with by the front desk, but then, to our dismay, we were moved to a pokey little room at the end of a corridor, about half the size of the first room! We did not bother complaining again, and stayed put. Note to self: New Year's resolution: Take up smoking.The next dissapointment was the breakfast, which was a pretty basic affair, even for Paris, and cooked incredibly poorly. The baked beans were boiled so much each day, that all flavour had been methodically extracted from each bean leaving them bland and indedible, and the scrambled eggs were a cheap floury cheap mess - not even the orange juice could escape the quest for improving the bottom line, as this was severely watered down.Again, not what I would expect from a Raddisson or a 4* hotel.The last point that was slightly annoying was that no internet connection had been arranged for our room, and every day, I was forced to use a temporary account linked to another guest and his room. It solved the problem of course, but left me with the impression that I wasn't a valued visitor of the hotel as they couldn't be bothered finding a long term solution.Lastly, in relation to the location, it's not bad (a metro station is available two minutes away, over the bridge), but as one reviewer points out, it is a little too far to go if using it as a base to explore Paris. All in all, I would say that this Radisson falls behind the standards of many of the others in the chain. I could go on about its many other annoyances: Charged 20 Euros for alledged mini bar usage (didn't open the fridge once) - Charged 16 Euros for three two minute calls made internally in Paris - Felt the rumbling of the Metro at night underneath us, which could wake light sleepers etcBut not having paid top dollar, these things didn't annoy us as much as they would have done ordinarily.In conclusion then, I would not recommend staying here if you are looking for luxury, 4* star standard or convenience, but only if you can secure an absolute bargain!

<Content>Very nice...but a little too far away from the centre A lovely hotel, very modern and the decor in the room is gorgeous. Very good standard in the bedroom and bathroom - comfortable, immaculate and spacious. Unfortunately the hotel is quite a long taxi or metro ride away from the centre of Paris and the main attractions. Would make an excellent base for a business trip, but for sight seeing not ideal, particularly if you have children.

<Content>Loved the room! Loved our stay! My boyfriend took me to Paris for our anniversary for four days. The hotel we stayed in was absolutely gorgeous, and it was by far better than I had imagined. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by 4 members of staff, who were very kind and helpful during all of our stay. They speak really good english, which really helped! There was a beautiful lounge, with a mezzanine of the first floor of which were hotel rooms which we stayed in. It was a luxury design! I was very impressed with the hotel room just as I was with the hotel in general, and I have taken photographs so please take a look! The room has a very modern feel to it, and there was also a wall fitted flat screen TV! There aren't much english channels to watch, but there are a few american channels, and BBC 1 and 2. There are movies which you can watch but you have to pay. Of course, we didn't come to watch TV! But during one of the late nights me and my boyfriend watched The Pursuit Of Happiness and Stomp The Yard which were about 7 EUR each, but we enjoyed both movies greatly. Very quiet during our stay too, and it wasn't so busy. Nothing bothered us during the nights.. we always slept until midday because I guess we were so comfortable! They gave us room service everyday of our stay, even though we didn't really require it that often, which I found really sweet. They changed all our towels everyday, and even our bed sheets! So everyday we came home to a brand new room! What more can you ask for? Other information:The travel adapter we brought was wrong, so don't worry, you can rent one there for 5 EUR, which you can get back at the end of your stay. There is also free broadband internet access there for business customers. The safe was also very high tech and safe too. There is free coffee and tea in the mini bar which we managed to finish on the second night! The restaurant looked interesting too, but the price list wasn't too impressive. There are so many restaurants just opposite the road of the hotel, which was more filling than anything! Paris:Overall, travel was by far more convenient than London. The french must hate walking, since the stops are so close to each other. But BEWARE, the tube map is so complexed! Porte de St Cloud is the nearest station to the hotel, and getting to places like the Tour Eiffel, Galeries Lafayette was easy and fairly quick... in fact everywhere was pretty convenient as the stops went really quickly. If in doubt, just take a taxi because they are also quite cheap! People in paris don't really speak english. Well, they do, but they are too lazy to talk to you in english, they like to prefer to answer to you in french. Especially in restaurants. It was fairly cold when we went to Paris, but we very much enjoyed our stay and the atmosphere there. We also went to disneyland on the last day also which was really fun! I really recommend this hotel for anyone who is planning on visiting Paris, as you will find it will really add comfort to your stay.There are other branches of this hotel, I believe one in centre of Paris too. I hope this review has helped you into finding a hotel for your stay, please feel free to email me for any other questions you may have! Hope you have fun!

<Content>Romantic anniversary weekend! We went for a weekend in Paris for our anniversary. This is a great hotel if you're on a bit of a budget but don't want too far to travel into the centre of Paris. It's only a tube ride away so it's no hassle to get to and from and is well worth it! We chose the Radisson as we have stayed with this chain before and knew what we were getting. It was very clean and provided us with a great base to enable us to explore the city! We didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast in bed which was very good. The service could not be faulted. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our room (what more could you want?!). I would recommend this hotel if you too are going to Paris for a city break.

<Content>new year break had business class room, breakfast very nice, location 20mins from central paris.Bought the nik-naks from shop opposite hotel eg: bottles of water only costing 0.60euro for 1.5 litre.Do ask for shuttle service from the information desk at the airport this costs 34euro for two people, will take you to any destination, possible with other passengers, no more than 3 stops, but a worthwhile professional service. He used this on the way back.There are some restaurants near the hotel which are reasonable.

<Content>Decent Hotel Stayed at the Radisson on business for 3 nights.Hotel was brighter and more modern than most European hotels in this price range. Had a flat screen TV. Hallways were newer and brighter than usual. Lobby area was small but plenty of seating room and inviting. Room and bed were decent, bathroom was large with good water pressure.Concierge and desk staff definitely showed effort in trying to be helpful. They were able to provide a room even though I was checking in fairly early in the morning. The concierge staff was able to direct me on foot to a couple of nearby locations. Getting a taxi was painful however, especially around 8 AM, so if possible, leave earlier or use another mode of transportation. The metro and buses are a very short walk away, and only a few stops from the center of Paris (took about 30 minutes to get to Musee d'Orsay for example).Had one dinner at the restaurant, and the food was adequate. I found the service to be friendly and they made an excellent wine recommendation.Overall, if looking for a hotel in the Issy/Boulogne/Porte de St. Cloud area, I would choose this hotel over the others.

<Content>Good hotel but a bit further from downtown We stay there for a day during our honeymoon ( we spent the rest of week at Radisson near Paris Boulogne AVE eDOUARD Vaillant 31-33.), Hotel is great, very clean and morden. Staff are very helpful. Breakfast was great fro about 30 bucks. We got there 7:00am and was raining, the staff let us into a room rightaway. The subway is 5 min walk, which is fine. But if you come home later through subway, I am not sure how safe is around. I think if you know your way around, or with lots of people, this is an excellent place to stay.

<Content>Much improved since opening Spent a few nights here in October 2007 and was very pleasantly surprised at the progress that's been made since they first opened in 2005. Although this was my first stay here, I had a group of colleagues stay there for 2 months in Sep-Oct 2005 just after the hotel had opened (I was living in Paris at the time) and found the service and general demeanor of staff to be consistently indifferent and irritable, and sometimes chaotic. Given the memory of this, I had been a little reluctant to book a stay here.Based on a 3-day stay, this appears now to have greatly changed. Staff were friendly and very accommodating (especially by Paris standards), both at reception and in the bar/restaurant areas.Restaurant food is traditional French fare, and very, very good, if somewhat costly, although the staff seemed unable to advise on the wine list (may have just been that particular night).The surrounding area is of little interest to tourists, being on the edge of Paris proper ('intra-muros') but transport into the centre is quick and easy by metro.

<Content>Great hotel We have just returned from a great weekend in Paris and thoroughly enjoyed our Radisson stay. We managed to get a good rate but would be prepared to stay here again at the full price. We had worried that it was too far out of the city centre but the Paris Metro is easy and quick to use so we really didn't notice the 15 mins or so that it took us to get in. On the first day we walked from our hotel along the river to the Eiffel Tower and that helped with our orientation and didn't take too long. We had a good room on the 8th floor (top?) and had everything we could need in a hotel room, as previous reviewers have noted. The staff were extremely helpful and charming to deal with. We left our luggage at both ends of our stay and enjoyed a coffee in the bar as we waited to check in and when waiting to go back to the airport. All very relaxing, surrounded by modern, tasteful decor and pleasant staff.We ate in the restaurant on the first night. Not cheap but the food was good and the service was excellent.We have previously stayed in the Radisson in Copenhagen and continue to think well of this hotel chain.

<Content>Very nice modern hotel Stayed here for 2 nights in February for a reasonable rate of 拢70 per room per night, booked through lastminutetravel.com. This price included breakfast.The hotel is what you would expect from a Radisson SAS, very modern, clean, professional staff, overall a very high standard. We stayed in a twin room, very nicely decorated, with high quality fittings and furnishings and an LCD TV. The bathroom was also of a high standard.The area is quite busy at night and there are a number of restaurants a short walk away. Although when we were there the hotel's restaurant was not open for dinner.Breakfast however, was buffet style and of a high quality.The hotel is a little far out from the centre of Paris but the Metro stop is a few minutes walk away and from there you can get around very easily.Overall I would recommend this hotel as a cheaper alternative to staying in central Paris, whilst of a very high standard.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Stayed here for two nights on a business trip - was very impressed with the hotel! It was modern and comfortable - the room and bathroom were huge by Paris standards! The bed was extremely comfortable and the entire space spotless. The Metro is very close so it's easy to get around and see the sights of central Paris. Staff/concierge were very helpful, although I think they gave us wrong information a few times (telling us that we couldn't just show up at a local restaurant, the concierge had to call and when we got there the place was empty; told my husband there was only one dinner cruise company when there are actually several, etc.). I think they must have an agreement with those places and get some kind of commission for referrals, which is fine - just be honest about it!Another poster mentioned a local restaurant, Chez Michel - it is actually only one block away, on the street that comes out directly in front of the hotel. It was a nice little place and the food was excellent, one of the best meals we had in Paris all week!It was a fairly easy day trip to Versailles from here - about 45 minutes total (short Metro plus an easy-to-catch bus).The hotel bar was hip and comfortable and the food in the restaurant very good. There is a small but well equipped fitness center and internet access is free. Would definitely recommend this hotel!

<Content>Radisson SAS couldn't be better! Stayed at the Radisson SAS Hotel Paris Bolougne in August 2006 for five nights. Our expectations of the Hotel were very high and we didn't get dissapointed as we were offered help with our luggage before we even entered the Hotel!The friendly staff gave us a nice and cosy room at the 8th floor with an excellent view towards the Eiffel tower!The hotel and its guest rooms are contemporary furnished and designed with nice warm colors. The breafast buff茅e was excellent with nothing to ask for... The only annoying thing was when the waiters kept asking us if we wanted refills for our coffee all the time!Our biggest concern was the distance to all attractions in Paris but with the highly efficient metro system we were able to reach all the sigts in no time! To walk from the Hotel to the Eiffel Tower takes roughly about an hour, with metro ten minutes!In conclusion: This is one of the best Hotels I've ever stayed in and I would love to return again!

<Content>Very good for visitingParis We stayed here two weeks ago on a family visit to Paris planned at the last minute. I was unsure about staying on the outskirts but found that the hotel was ideal. It is five minutes at most (over a pedestrian bridge which crosses the peripherique) to the metro line at Porte St Cloud from which you can go anywhere on the Paris metro. The bus terminus is also nearby from whcih you have easy bus access to Trocadero, Arc de Tropmhe and Opera.The staff were excellent and very helpful. The room was fine and very clean. The hotel is busy - lots of business people, but for the four day city break we were on we didn't mind. Breakfast was very good. (I do agree with the person who warned about the sausages i.e. if you are used to the British/Irish sausage these look but do not taste the same!).All in all - we were very pleased and would recommend.

<Content>Boulogne-Billancourt Radisson Very nice new and clean business hotel on the outer border of Paris. I won't repeat what everyone else has emphasized except for a couple of things:- Stay away from the sausages at breakfast (mine was included so i ate there everyday but didn't touch the hot meats after the first day).- There is no problem with the hot water in the shower. The prior poster did not figure out how to use the controls correctly. - If you are taking the metro there, the exit is Porte de Saint-Cloud on line 9. When you are exiting the metro station, go for the exit that says Boulogne. Once you go up the stairs there should be a walkway that crosses the highway. Cross that and you should see the Radisson directly in front of you on the left hand side. If I were visiting Paris on vacation, I probably wouldn't stay there because while it is only a short metro trip into the city, I found it somewhat inconvenient for my tastes and there isn't much going on in Boulogne. Rooms were comfortable, large by European standards and very clean. Great service too.

<Content>Closer than you think I accompanied my wife on a business trip here. After spending 5 days in central Paris I expected to be very disappointed with the location of this hotel. After being underwhelmed by the surrounding businesses and apartments I found the interior to be very modern and nice with large rooms and bathrooms. Staff had a good working knowledge of English and were very patient with my travel French. Access to The Metro was easy and I was at The Louvre in 20 minutes.If you do stay here there is not many obvious choices for dining except the hotel restaurant. Ask the Concierge where Chez Michel is. It is tucked about 3 blocks away in the local neighborhood and is quite excellent if you're not looking to go into Paris for dinner.

<Content>Very nice, comfortable and modern...would stay again. When we arrived at CDG airport we travelled by Metro to the Pont De St-Cloud station and it took about 15 mins. The area where the hotel is located is pleasent enough with a few supermarkets dotted around which are all within walking distance. The Metro station is about a 5 minute walk to the hotel.The hotel itself is very modern, it has a big open lobby which you enter through some front revolving doors. The staff where very helpful and although it wasn't check-in time they took our bags and stored them until 3pm when we returned. We were given our keycard for the room and our lugggage was brought up to us.The room was lovely - it had a huge King-Size bed with fresh linen sheets - the room was VERY clean and had a big plush bathroom with a mixture of different shampoo's, conditioner, gels and creams. Mounted on the wall was an LCD TV with a massive range of channels including Sky News, BBC1 and BBC2!My only problems with the hotel where that the bar closed at about 12 on an evening, it would have been nice to of had a nightcap when we returned on a night. Also, room service was pricey with only a limited selection and they tried to over charge us for this, just be aware of that.To summarise, the hotel was good. It was out of the hustle and bustle of central Paris but in an ideal location for getting the metro to some of the sights e.g. the Louvre, The Eiffel Tower, The Latin Quarter etc...The place was very comfortable and we would definitely stay again.We also got engaged which made things all the better...

<Content>Pleasant Surprise We stayed at this Radisson SAS in October 2005, just a few months after it opened it doors. The hotel was obviously new and very clean and quiet. The facilities were excellent, and it's approx. 10 minutes to the nearest Metro station. However like another review, we did take about 30 minutes to find the hotel from the Metro station. (Our fault)It's approx 10 minutes from the Eiffel Tower and 15 minutes from the Champs Elysees, so is close enough to enjoy Paris. Don't be put off because the hotel is not in the centre of Paris.The area is very pleasant and worth the extra distance.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris.

<Content>Radisson SAS Boulogne I have just returned from a weekend trip to France and stayed at this hotel and I was very impressed.The Hotel is situated about 30-40mins from CDG Airport in a quiet residential area, which is ideal for a peaceful stay. On arrival I was suprised to find the Hotel is brand new (only 1or 2 years old), it is very modern looking and spotlessly clean. I stayed in a Twin Room which again was spotless with everything you needed - Bed, Shower, Kettle, Sat TV (which included BBC1  2 as well as Sky News) and a Safe Deposit Box. The room size was adequate although I have stayed in smaller.Breakfast was 22 euros (拢16) which is quite steep although you can't fault the selection - Cereals, Fruit, Juice, Tea, Coffee, Toast, Yoghurt, Salmon, Cheese and of course the Full English but be warned the Sausage and Bacon are not what you would get back home in blighty and if I am honest not very nice. However, you must try the Croissants which are the best I have ever tasted. The Hotel boasts a Fitness Room (which I never used), but looked very impressive and a lounge area where you could relax and read the papers although DONT buy a beer there 拢15 Euros for a pint - Thats 拢11.There is a metro station is around 300mts away and its only 15mins to the centre of Paris.There are also some nice little restaurants along this street and not very expensive.The Staff are excellent and speak very good English. I would certainly recommend the Hotel to stay at - But beware the sausages !!!!!

<Content>Very Comfortable The Radisson Boulogne is very new, very modern and very clean. we stayed in superior room (the basic one) and found this to be very comfortable and spotlessly clean. I am a very light sleeper when away from home and can normally hear pins dropping two floors up but found the room sound insulation to be very good and heard nothing from the adjoining rooms. However there is a faint rumble of Metro to be heard (even from the 4th floor) but nothing to complain about.There is minimal nightlife as this is a decent residential area although there are still a few half decent restaurants and a bar nearby. The drinks at the hotel bar are ludicrous, e.g. 15 euros for a 50cc beer, that's about 拢10 a pint for UK people. Don't drink there.I did not dine in the evenings at the hotel but the breakfast was not bad, with a large selection of just about anything you could think of. However, the French have never been able to do sausage, bacon and baked beans like the English. I was B  B but I think 22 euros for breakfast would have been a little on the steep side but I've seen worse.There is a Metro terminus about 300 yards away and it only takes about 15 minutes into the city centre.The room size was adequate rather than spacious but on the whole very highly recommended.

<Content>new  i went for a business trip and the meeting was held in the hotel.. the hotel itself is excellent, so i had to give it the highest rating.. but it is pretty far from the city center.. even the driver who picked us up at CDG was surprised to hear we were staying in Boulogne, which i guess is mostly residential.. the staff is cordial and proficient in english, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, everything is renovated and very trendy looking.. the water in the shower had a temperature cap and, in my opinion, was never hot enough, which would have seriously bothered me, but i only stayed there for 2 nights.. and the wireless internet continously dropped, so it was extremely difficult to check emails unless using the internet cable.. the food was great, very expensive though, but there is a cute sandwich shop across the street with delicious baguettes.. the hotel recommended a restaurant down the way, which the staff said was the best in the area and my group found that it was not very good (although the ambience was excellent).. so, all in all, i don't recommend staying at this hotel unless you are making a quick visit and there is a meeting nearby.. if you're coming to Paris to see the sites, then this hotel is out of the way and you probably shouldn't bother.. but i do recommend this hotel if you're looking to book a trendy, clean, luxurious room or meeting.
