<Content>Hard to fault this resort. We were in Bali for 2 nights and decided to book when we got there. The Bali Garden Beach Resort was high on our list of place to stay at, however when approaching the desk they told us it was fully booked. We then used their computers to book through wotif.com who had plenty of rooms. (they won't offer this to you, do it yourself) This is a fantastic place to stay. The service is great, the rooms clean and large. we stayed in rooms 123 and 122 that face away from the pool area. I thought they might be a bit noisy with the busy Kuta stretch just metres away from us, but this wasn't the case. You have a courtyard that isn't secluded from your neighbours, so don't go out for a whizz in the morning. There is also a clothes airer for each room.Breakfast... ohh.. breakfast! I don't usually eat breakfast, but how can you resist?? There is everything available from fried rice, mie goreng, fresh fruit, pastries, toast (no vegemite or peanut butter), croissants just to name a few! They also have someone cooking eggs just the way you like them and pancakes. They are very quick. I can vouch for the omelets (I asked for extra mushrooms) and also the banana pancakes. The coffee is great and there are a selection of juices also. Try to get a deal with free breakfast.The pools are great! No unmanned pool bars here and plenty of seating around the bar. The staff were fantastic in the pool bar. The restuarant (The Boardwalk) was also very good. I ate lambshanks which were to die for! They were a bit pricier than other restaurants and the portions weren't huge, but well worth it I thought. Especially when you are sitting right on the beach at a candle lit table. The staff offered insect repellent and a torch for reading the menu.Tip: We offered our bottles of alcohol to the pool bar if they would pour us free drinks for our stay, in turn, they could keep the rest of the alcohol. They were very happy to do this as alcohol is very hard to come by at the moment and Very expensive ($8 per glass) Close by: Centro shopping centre 2 doors down. Waterbom accross the road. DVD's for $1.25AU each 2 doors up. AC flexi tellers across the road. Numerous shops and restaurants.

<Content>Great Location Hotel Pools where fantastic,location fantastic,spa fantastic , staff friendly The only negative thing was the rooms are outdated however they are being renovated , Aslong as you dont come here expecting buckingham palace you will enjoy your stay !*recomend if staying here ask for your room to be at the back of the hotel not the front or side as it can get very noisy due to taxi drivers beeping and building works.*

<Content>Fantastic pools, shame about teh beach replenishment Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in October 2008, and whilst the rooms were pretty bland the pools and outside areas facing the beach are lovely. 3 pools - one infinity, one with a pool bar and a spa pool.The hotel is right on the beach but the beach was being replenished during our stay so you couldn't actually use it and had to walk to the main Kuta beach (about 5 - 10 minutes). All, in all though this is a good holiday hotel and the staff were always very friendly.

<Content>Just say NO! My partner and our 4 primary aged children booked the Bali Garden hotel primarily for the family rooms and location opposite Water Bom Park. We requested a family room and Deluxe room on the South side to avoid smoke pollution and fumes from the crematorium on the North side next door and the 24/7 traffic of graders and trucks accessing the beach through the adjoining block. Consequently we had 2 rooms on the 2nd floor. Both rooms were small and shabby, with grey threadbare towels, chipped furniture and had very tired small bathrooms. Our balcony faced the entrance of the Ryoshi restaurant 3 meters away, where stray cats screeched for scraps and fought EVERY night from 10pm until dawn. Our childrens balcony was less than 1m square and opened onto a lane with a car park. The breakfast was average to be kind with all of the hot food dry and bland. There were lots of good looking young staff standing around the lovely pool area, but none were interested in anything but socialising with each other. The pool and restaurant area on the beach were beautiful but the 2m high rusty metal pipe line extending the length of the beach, obstructed any view and the constant roar of excavators, graders and trucks along the beach seriously detracted from any atmosphere. We felt extremely sorry for the couple who had their wedding ceremony spoiled by this during our stay. By 9pm each night most guests had escaped the area to seek somewhere more pleasant to enjoy the balmy evenings. Having said that the restaurants had great staff and the food was pretty good for a big hotel. The front desk staff were brilliant and professional and we were very happy with their attitude and friendliness. They did manage to move us when we could not sleep from the cats noise, even over the air con running all night. Only to find ourselves in two ground floor rooms overlooking a galvanized iron fence which blocked the view but not noise from the earth moving vehicles using the block next door as a thoroughfare to the excavations on the beach. This was one of the most expensive hotels we stayed at and was by far the very worst. The location was not worth it. If you've got lot's of kids and are on a budget - check out the Melasti.

<Content>Another great stay Again on our annual stay at Bali Garden and as always a great experience. 3 weeks of sun and fun.New pools were brilliant. The pool bar had quick service and friendly staff - The Boardwalk Resturant is devine, never had a bad meal, the menu has a great variety - delicious. Rooms spacious, comfortable and clean. caught a glimps at new renovated rooms - looking good. Nothing is ever a problem for staff, always ready to help with a smile. The Beauty Spa is to die for. Sunset Bar is a great place to unwind, cocktails at sunset are a must! This was our 5th stay at Bali Garden and the staff are always happy to see you back, they actually remember you!Although the hotel is an older resort, they are putting money into it and its looking really good. You can't beat the location. The kids had a ball and my husband and I were totally relaxed. Already planning next years trip. Would never stay anywhere else.

<Content>Comfort at reasonable rates We travelled foursome (a Malaysian couple and an English couple) and stayed at Bali Garden Hotel for 3 nights 23-26 Sept recently. We found the hotel value for money, much better than some other hotels we stayed in in other parts of the world. We went to Hangzhou, Nanjing, Souzhou, Shanghai (destinations in China) a few days before Bali, and the 4/5 stars we stayed in in those places were nowhere near Bali Garden Hotel except one. The rooms in Bali Garden Hotel are a bit antiquated, but comfort is there. The bathroom needs a bit of upgrading though, the seating bowl is old and the room is gloomy. The hot water supply is satisfactory, room service is absolutely pleasing. The reception people are warm, and this includes the various category of staff whom we met along the corridors and common areas of the hotel. Even the hotel security is polite though official. We will definitely go back to Bali Garden Hotel if we travel to this part of the world again, it's a pleasant experience to savour once more.

<Content>Great value for money hotel in unbeatable location I have stayed here with my family on several occasions. The fantastic location right on Kuta Beach and the great service from smiling staff continues to bring us back to Bali Gardens Hotel. This year was a pleasant surprise with some outstanding refurbs having been completed in the lobby, the sports bar and the outstanding restaurant and bar on the beach with the fabulous new swimming pools. Although the hotel was virtually full there was always plenty of space around the pools to watch the sunset while relaxing in the modern new furniture. This hotel continues to represent great value for money. I was fortunate enough to have alook at a mock up of the planned refurb commencing soon in the rooms. They look great and will complete what has now become a fantastic product with service to match. This hotel is great value and you cannot beat the location with the entrance amongst great shopping and opposite attractions such as Waterbom Park and the other end of the hotel leading directly onto Kuta Beach. Highly recommended. We will definately be back.

<Content>Great location but... My partner and I stayed at the Bali Garden for 10 days in the Deluxe room. This was our second stay at this hotel, last time we stayed in the Villa with family.We have mixed feelings about this hotel. We love the location, the new pools are great, and the new restaurant on the beach is lovely. But the rooms are ordinary and we had several problems.What we loved:We love the location of this hotel, it's one of the few hotels in Kuta/Legian that is actually right on the beach. The Bali Garden is also in the heart of the major shopping area, being next to the Centro shopping centre and a five minute walk from Kuta Square.The pools are great (3 in total) a lap pool, normal pool and a spa pool. The new restuarant and beach bar are resonalby priced, we ate lunch there everyday, not to mention the sunsets are beautiful. There was also a wedding which was cool.What we disliked:We did not recieve the Queen size bed we booked, instead we got 2 singles pushed together but still made up as singles, it took being ran around by reception for three days and complaining to the manager to finally get a room with a double bed. The bathrooms are poorly lit, have mould and have pooling water on the floor. The water was never hot, just luke warm! There also seemed to be an ant problem in the 2nd room we stayed in as they were crawling over the desk everyday. At one stage there was some work being done in the roof whilst we were staying (something to do with the hot water system), which was fine, providing a flying piece of concrete doesn't come hurtling towards you (luckily it missed), we should have been told that work was going to be done. Following that the workers decided to test their handy work by turning the water back on, little did they know that this would created a lovely waterfall at the front door of my room, obviously their handy work wasn't that handy after all. To be honest I laughed when a worker saw me standing on the other side of the doorway/waterfall and started screaming in indonesian at his boofhead workmates, it had become comical by this stage.Customer service (from reception, not pool/bar staff) and comunication needs to be improved.We were told by management that the deluxe rooms are going to be refurbished, and the prices will also be going up next April. However they will really need to lift their game both in service and room standards to justify this.We also stayed at another hotel for 6 days, so we had something to compare bali garden to. While we paid a fair bit more for the other hotel, we got every dollars worth. Value for money isn't about how much you pay but what you get for your money!We are easy going people and not hard to please but it would seem to us that the owners (who were there at the time planing for renovations etc.) are more interested in their ROI (return on investment) than customer satisfaction.Cheers.

<Content>Okay if you are there for the surfing.... other deals to be had. Hmm, stayed here on 29/ 30th April 2008. What can I say... good standard for a back packer, not so good for / my mum - far too dated . Worst than some backbacker places I have stayed at actually - and I have travelled alot- and we were in delux! Bathroom had a unscrewed toilet seat, bath and floor were dirty even though they had been cleaned - only took a shower no way could you spend anytime than necessary in those bathrooms.To be fair to the place, it is good value for money if you are in for the surfing/ diving/touring and are there for a couple of days and not bothered about your room. Outside gardens/ food /bar are done up to a good 3 star standard - just a shame about those rooms!! Checked out after two nights- to a lastminute deal in a five star resort in Nusa Dua (near enough the same price too!). Oh, and there are no proper security checks in place either at BGH ie. no detectors before you go through the gates/ gates closed in routine - felt it was a bit lax with procedures, though there were security guys around, I think anyone could have walked in to the complex.To sum up a good point: Compliments to the tour driver in Bali Gardens, we had an excellent day out to the volcano/ Ubud - so there is a plus!One bad point: a rat running passed my lounge chair- now wondering if there were a family of rats under the decking!! As I mentioned, we moved to Nusa Dua for the remaining four nights... in an apartment, with 2 plasma screens, really comfy bed, FREE WIFI!, DVD, exceelent security, good food, infinity pool, sand beach, beach bar, lots of sun loungers, spa... five star luxury really... at virtually the same price (par the inflated tour prices - which you can dodge if you do your own research)! Maybe I'm a backpacker all grown up, but sometimes a little bit of luxury goes a long way... especially good value five star deals!Anyone reading this who's a diver? Took me a bit to find a dive co.....Aquamarine divers - well recommended.

<Content>great location, great new pools, great value well, just got back yesterday and had a great stay, we were a party of 8 in 2 lots of interconnecting rooms. while the rooms had everything you needed they were a little shabby - but who cares for 80 bucks a night!! including breakfast , i hear they are to be renovated soon anyway. the new pool and bar/restaurant area are fully renovated now and are fantastic, spent lots of time in the pool with the kids and some bintangs. the beachside restaurant has brilliant food at fantastic prices and all the staff are lovely. the location of this hotel was great too, you could easily walk to any restaurant or even to legian which without pushing a pram took about 10 minutes and a thousand no thankyou, i already have 10 billabong t shirts. i'd recommend this hotel to anyone who is on any kind of budget, if you want to stay at a brand new pristine 5 star hotel well go for it. if you dont mind a bit a hotel room that needs a bit of TLC, but still has everything you want : aircon, foxtel, fridge etc i think it is a great place and good value for money. kazzamac

<Content>Great place after renovation My family have stayed at Bali Garden Hotel many times in the past 5-6 years, and every time we have had really great stays at this hotel. Kids love playing in the pools, and after the renovation they are even nicer than before, with a completely new and fantastic beach front area offering a good selection of food and drinks - and a new huge pool bar. We have also used the spa many times and we love it!The hotel staff have always been friendly, and they have been very helpful with various needs for children.The rooms are basic and a bit worn out, but we usually don't spend much time in the room anyway - there are too many things to see and do!With this location, and compared to the price level I can't think of any hotel that can beat the Bali Garden.

<Content>Ideal Location This hotel is in an excellent location, quiet, comfortable beds and pillows. Hotel rooms are a little run down, but clean. Hotel has been / is renovating, there is no disturbance to people staying, hotel sprays twice a week to keep mosquitoes in check. Can hire DVD player from reception. Breakfast is: eggs (done any way you like, including omlette), pankakes, toast, crossaunts and one other pastry, fruit, some asian fare (noodles) if you want bacon you need to ask for it and they bring it to your table. There is no cereal, we found it got a little boring. You must try the bakery in the Centro shopping centre (next door). Great food and atmosphere at Pandon restaurant opposite shopping centre. Pool is good, (has pool bar) but most days you will need to get to the pool before 11 to get a deck chair, these are a little limited. Overall not a bad hotel and if Iwe were to go back to Bali we would stay here again.

<Content>Dirty, discusting, disappointing Worst hotel I have ever stayed in . Booked months in advance and got a room with no view. Also a smoking room when we booked a non smoking. Dirty floors and bathroom. No towels, discusting sticky dirty table tops. Woke up during the night to find cockroaches in the bathroom. Sanitry pad rubbish still in the bin when we arrivedPool didnt have enough deck chairs with covers. One of the chairs we used broke...the list goes on.After 2 days of complaining they finally gave us another room which was just as bad. No apology (or cockroach spray) for the cockroaches...even when we spoke to the manager.Good points?? Bed was comfortable and air con worked. Breakfast was ok. Staff were ok. I refused to walk bare foot on the floor in the room and showered with shoes on..I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone...NOT like in the photos on website. Please be cautious.

<Content>Average..but staff is nice Date: April 25 - 28My friend and I have book a tour package from the hotel directly, 4days 3 night at a reasonable price. We have a airport pickup by van. The lobby is typically Balinese style and a bit old. But during my visit, the lobyy is renovating. The room is look exactly the same with the photo posted in their official website. We have deluxe room and the room look OK, only the comment is the sinki is stuck and some unknown things floating on the sinki when you pour water on it. The water is not so clean. Advise to buy mineral water from shop rather boil the water.We try to avoid to use the sinki. Corridor is a bit dark and they should add on some light. The breakfast is good and location is perfect. 10min to reach Hard Rock Cafe and around the hotel, there have a lot of shop, kuta famous center - Matahari square ( the things is quite expensive), restaurant, convinience shop. Next to the beach and not much people will go to that beach as it is not beautiful  the wave is stronge. The staff is nice and always smile with you. The services is Ok.

<Content>disappointing stayed for two weeks on recommendation of travel agent. The room we booked wasn't available when we arrived and then they tried to give a room with single beds. Eventually we got a family room just for the two of us. The room was big but very basic. The lobby and hallways in need of work as quite old. The staff not terribly friendly like on other Bali visits. Our room was so noisy. It faced the street. Pool bar was good. Cheap poolside food. The breakfasts where good. Wouldn't go back to this hotel. Best to pay the bit extra and get way better. Overall disappointed with the hotel.

<Content>Very noisy! 11 of us stayed at Bali garden in Sep 2005  everyone of us had a problem with our room, we even went so far as to write an A4 size complaint all of us which fell on deaf ear.I had no power in my room for 7 hours. The noise was so bad so don't stay superior unless your a real heavy sleeper  don't mind noise. There is also a cemetary next door with cremations regularly.The pool light wires are exposed in pool  have been that ay since April 2005 that I know of  were still that way in September 2005  December 2005. The manager was an Aussie at the time which made it even worse.The lifts don't work  haven't been working for over 8 months either as Ifound out when I got injured in Bali  returned to my hotel in a wheelchair  my room on 3rd floor!!They had no rooms to move me to on ground floor!

<Content>Bali Garden Hotel Resort  Our stay in Bali Garden Hotel was very good. My wife and I appreciated the kind hospitality of the staff at Bali Garden Hotel, we found them very friendly and helpful. The layout of the hotel is very accessible with beautiful garden and swimming pool area with easy access to the beach, this is a great place for family holiday with children. Next door is Centro Flaza shopping outlets with access to supermarket and other novellty shops. Cross the road is waterbom park which is a great place for children and adults. I recommend Bali Garden Hotel to you because it is close access to airport only 5 minutes, reasonable prices which includes breakfast. They are very good places for dining out close by.All in all great place to stay.

<Content>Can't wait to get back to Bali Garden My son and I stayed at the Bali Garden for 11 days during Feb/March, 2006. We found the hotel to be of a high standard, very friendly and helpful staff. Room was always cleaned promptly.Safety deposit box in the room was so convenient.Room was spacious and the balcony was so peaceful, both morning and evening times.Hotel is within walking distance to everything,ie: shopping, nightlife, restaurants etc.The added bonus was that it is opposite Waterbom Park. So convenient when you are dripping wet.The pool was great along with the Pizzeria on the beach. We just loved everything about this hotel and can't wait to go back next year.Like other people have said It is not the Paradiso or Dynasty, but is definately value for money.I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great Value If you are looking for a 5 star resort this isn't it, but if you want great value, this is it.The Bali Garden Hotel is on one side of Centro Mall and the 5 star Kartika hotel is on the other side.On this same trip we first stayed at the Kartika and then went to Lombok and stayed our last 2 nights at the Bali Garden. We liked it so much that our friends are booked to stay in February.This is rated as 3 star hotel so the price is great. It was almost half the price of the Kartika and we still got the same location, nice size pool surrounded by beautiful garden and a limited amount of lounge chairs. There were soft cushions, the pool towels have seen better days, the food ordered from the pool was great and better still it wasn't 5 star prices, we didn't feel we needed to leave the pool to go get a snack or have a beer. The garden and fish pond is beautiful, it isn't as big as the kartika, and as beautifully manicured but nice just the same.Our room was quiet, everything worked, it was spacious, the balcony was large (the furniture was not comfortable and had seen many a better day).It actually had a coffee making area, drawers for clothes and a fridge, and complimentary water.Breakfast was definitely good (better than the 4 star hotel in Lombok)not incredible, but we had no complaints.Note: make sure that you get a room facing the ocean. I don't think it would be very quiet if you got a room facing the street.Also, if you are going with a family, they have one villa which is a pleasant bungalow with 3 bedrooms, kitchen and living room for a very reasonable price.

<Content>Great location but out of Kuta area Impressed by stay at Bali Garden Hotel, great location... property on beachfront (which attracts the hawkers selling their goods but not over the top like other parts of the beach!)Great pool....brilliant! Great service... always keen to help and assist with queries..Great for all types of tourists... Breakfast okay... became repetitive... but great quality food... very nice pancakes/omeletes! Location is south of Kuta.. so away from the main hustle and bustle of Kuta but really only a walk away anyway... If want to stay out of Kuta but want to be close to everything... pick Tuban.. Bali Garden Hotel is close to resorts such as Discovery Kartika Plaza... not on the same level as this property at all but a great cheaper alternative... remember though if looking for a resort... Bali Garden is not it!... it is a hotel with a great pool/location and price! I have recommended to friends...
