We had traveled quite a lot before and been to countries more exotic than the US, but actually never had an experience as disgusting before:- unfriendly staff- creapy place- bed bugs and fleas, blood streams all over the bedDon't let Mithila spoil your stay in SFO!!!

<Content>Wrost staying ever! This is the first time I write a review on website ever! I am a budget traveller for 10 years and used to stay in even much cheaper hotels all around in Europe and Asia but never had an experience as bad as this time.I went to SF for 5 days and stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. The main reason I'd chosen here was the cheap price and the okay review on the website. Of cause I didn't expect anything for a $100 hotel in SF during weeeknd but I was still very unhappy about the condition of the room. It's probably worse than the $30/night hostel in the same area. The staff was extremely unhelpful, the room was dark and stinky and curtain in the bath was horribly dirty... I've met 3 staffs there and all of them are unfriendly and not willing to answer questions! I started using their free wifi once I get into the room but I couldnt connect to the Internet... As I just use Internet with my computer in a cafe mins ago, and the pervious hotel the night before. I suppose it might be some setting problem or a password needed. I went to their reception and ask for help... The staff called Johnathan tried to help with testing the internet with his phone and computer. It wasn't working on his phone and super slow on his computer (open the CNN page in almost a min!) And then he told me the internet is working perfectly on his computer therefore it must be my computer problem! -_- And then he just throw me a no. of technical support, asked me to call them by myself! I tried to see if I can use their phone for the call or the phone in the room, and he said no with a super bad attitude and also warn me if I use the phone in the room, I will be charged a lot of money. No matter what I asked him, he just kept saying it is my computer's problem coz he can connect with his own computer and I have to sort it out by myself. Then I asked for his name and told him I will leave them a bad review to their bad service, and walked back to my room. He suddenly ran out of the counter and stopped me, yelling on me saying he's done his best to help and called the techical person saying it is a extrememly trouble customer here... see if they can call me to my room! Well... Finally they found that they are updating their server which cause the problem and no one was supposed to connect to the internet normally. If you still insist to give this hotel a try. Do check the room before you check-in! And remember to bring your own towlers, sampoo, etc, and don't expect anyone would help you during your stay!

<Content>Budget hotel in great location I was a little worried about staying in the hotel because of all of the negative reviews I'd read, but I'm glad I did. First and most importantly, the main reason to stay here is the location. Union Sqaure is within walking distance, and Chinatown and the North End are close as well. The hotel itself is fairly small, and the carpet and furnishings are definitely old, but the bathroom and bedsheets were clean. If you're going to spend a lot of time in the hotel, this probably isn't the place for you, but if you only need a place to stay, it works out fine. Unlike some other reviewers, I had very friendly service with no surprise charges, and they only required one ID and credit card for 2 guests. My biggest complaint was the street noise, which was very loud during the night. Because there's no air conditioning, we had to keep the window open at night, and I was awakened a few time by horns, drunk people yelling, etc. The hotel walls are not too thick either, and I did hear other guests walking and talking in the hall. However, overall, the location can't be beat for the price, and though it's not the most luxurious place, it's very suitable for a short stay.

<Content>Not THAT bad. But not for the high maintanence traveler... This hotel isn't horrible. It is not for people who are used to staying in 4  5 star hotels. We've stayed in all classes of hotels. These guys had the best price in the middle of town. We were looking to save some money because we had been traveling all week. Our luggage was safe, nobody bugged us.It wasn't squeaky clean, but not bad. The bed was made every day and the floors and bathroom were fairly clean.The traffic was pretty loud, but that is to be expected when staying in downtown San Fran.

<Content>Junk When we walked into the room, which was supposed to be ready, the bed wasn't made and had trash on the floor and table. We had to leave for half an hour so they could clean it. Not fun after a long trip!! Not only that, I didn't realize until I returned home from my trip that they had charged me for an extra night. I called them and faxed them my receipt and they never contacted me back for my refund. The front desk workers always tell me the manager isn't there. This place was horrible.

<Content>Horrid! Do not stay here! The room was filthy! It looked like the floors had never been cleaned, there was lots of mold on the bathtub and shower curtain, and the bed had been made with somebody else's undergarments left in it!We had paid upfront for four nights. The hotel's website says it will refund your remaining nights if unsatisfied. We were unsatisfied, and asked for our money back immediately. The night manager told us it was impossible to give us any refund; that we had to speak to the hotel manager in the morning. My wife and I slept in our clothes on top of the bed coverings with loud drunk people coming and going all night long. In the morning the hotel manager also refused to refund any of our four nights - not even the remaining three! We left anyways because we didn't want to ruin our vacation in san francisco by staying at the Mithila Hotel. We found a lovely hotel just up the street that had a very nice, clean room for the same price.do not stay here!

<Content>Location  There can be no doubt you will find better places to stay in San Francisco but the challenge will be to find one in such a central location for this price.We paid 拢45 per night to be located bang in the centre of San Francisco - that will take some beating.Our room was dated and small - but absolutely spotless clean and kept that way.Recommend this hotel for those on a budget who can accept that you get what you pay for and must be located in the centre of SF.

<Content>Do not stay here.. a dusty, dirty rip off. As a frequenter of hostels and pensione in Europe I am accustomed to roughing it but this place is downright dirty. So dusty i came out with red streaming eyes and a runny nose every morning.. not nice. An absolute rip off compared to all other places we stayed at in California and the West Coast. Staff were not helpful, nor knowledgable about simple questions. Had to leave cash desposits to use phone in room despite leaving credit card details at desk.H I have three hostels in SF... we had friends staying at city centre one in private room ensuite, they payed nearly 50 dollars less a night for an experience that was wayyy better. You have been warned.

<Content>Friendly staff, decent place, convenient location The staff here - Tim - is very nice and helpful. The place is old, so the elevator is ancient and the walls are a bit thin, but we found the place clean and acceptable. Good hot water for the showers. Had a TV and fridge. Quick and free Wi-Fi. All the necessities. Not the most comfortable mattress. The hotel is convenient--a quick walk from Union Square. And near a great Thai restauarant - Thai House Express. There are some rough folks walking around at night, but there are also expensive cars parked on the street. It's the city.

<Content>Satisfactory stay at Mithila hotel I stayed at the Mithila Hotel in S. Francisco for 8 days at the end of February. The hotel was satisfactory, compared with the price. The room was clean at my arrival and was cleaned every morning during my stay. The washbasin and the bath were a bit slow in draining the water, but they were working nevertheless. The staff of the hotel was quite helpful and friendly.I would advise to warn the staff of the hotel beforehand with the expected time of the arrival. This could save a long wait outside the door.Globally, I think that the negative reviews that I have read about this hotel are not fair. I think that considered the cost, the good location and the popularity of S. Francisco, this hotel offers good value for money.

<Content>Hotel Mithila. Mithila Hotel Is Not Recommended!!! I recently made a 2 night reservation with the Hotel Mithila and can honestly say I am extremely dissatisfied with this establishment. This trip was for my 4 month old infant who had surgery at UCSF Children's Hospital early the next morning. We got into San Francisco arounds 11 pm and the hotel was informed that we would be a late check-in so we arrived there a liitle after 11:00 pm and proceeded to check-in. the person, desk clerk proceeded as normal asked for ID and credit card, in which I had but then asked for the other adult, my husband's ID and credit card also and said that he would need a credit card and ID for all adults that were staying in the room, in which I've never heard of - not even in the 4 star hotels that we've stayed in the past! Unfortunately my husband fhad forgotten his ID in the rush to get to San Francisco since we traveled by train then walked to the hotel with our 2 infants. The clerk did not even proceed any further and turned us away and said there was nothing he could do about this  that this was there policy. What the !?*# !!! We tried to explain that we were traveling with our 2 infant sons but he was not even compassionate to the fact that we had walked all that way with our 2 little ones and had surgery the next morning but still got turned away. I was absolutely disgusted! It was late and just wanted to get my 2 little one's into a warm, safe and comfortable room to rest but had to take them back out into the cold, late night and had to walk quite a few blocks to find other accomodations, the Travelodge, Civic Center who had no problem checking us in as a walk-in. whom I am extremely greatful. Travelodge is the greatest! and accomodations were much more nicer than the Mithila. I just wanted all to know how horrible the Mithila is and to NOT use this establishment! The Mithila is horrible!

<Content>Decent Stay My girlfriend and I wanted to take advantage of a long weekend so we decided to fly to San Francisco. We did not realize while trying to book a room that the USC/ Cal football game was that weekend, so hotel availability at around $100 was scarce. We chose this hotel due to the price, location, and reviews. When we arrived from the airport from BART, we were caught in a major downpour. We tried to grab a cab, but just started walking toward the hotel. We arrived at the hotel completely drenched. It was before the check-in time, but the man said our room was ready. We were relieved we could change out of our clothes and dry off.  The room was freezing cold, with a window open. The towels provided were a complete joke. I actually found a hair ball inside one of the towels. Since we were just happy to be able to change into dry clothes we did not complain.The next morning, as we were leaving to got to breakfast, I noticed the maid cleaning the room right next door. I put the room service sign on the door, and verbally asked her to turn over our room ASAP. We came back from breakfast hoping to get a shower before heading out, only to find the room still untouched. I went to search for the maid, and after climbing up and down all the stairs (there is a door to the roof which I guess is available to the guests judging from the empty beer cans), I located her. She spoke zero english, so I just impatiently took some towels. The towels were much nicer than the ones from the previous night. No hairballs this time!After we came back later the room was cleaned. The rooms are pretty standard, and its not like we were going to do anything in the room besides sleep and shower. The desk staff was helpful and friendly. We really appreciated being able to check-in early. We are going back to the city again in Febuary for another long weekend. We realize we can't expect much for $100 a night so we are going to spend a little more.

<Content>Clean and decent We went for budget, a place to sleep. Room was clean and neat but smoke detector wires dangled from ceiling. They said as long as sprinklers are operational don't need a smoke detector? Non-smoking hotel -climbed up to roof to smoke or went outside. Funky old-style elevator. Coffee and mini-muffins every day. Most staff helpful and pleasant. Wi-fi connection available. Refrigerator and microwaves in rooms. Grocery store a couple blocks away. Great little pizza place a few doors up, open late. Hotel borders Nob Hill/Tenderloin districts, hookers in one direction, Top of the Mark in the other. Pretty centrally located. It was a decent place to stay, price was good, use the coupon books for a better rate. May or may not stay again.

<Content>Just for Sleeping 972 Sutter is walkable to Union Square or Chinatown (10+ blockes straight on Sutter), but eventually you would opt to take the frequent buses 2, 3, or 4, which runs on Sutter coming, and one street down on Post going. Muni fare is $1.50, take a transfer so you could use it any direction for the next 2 hours. One should not choose Mithila to expect any charm, but for an inexpensive stay with basic amenities for a good night sleep. Management was cordial and professional; they readily willing to store my luggage for a few extra hours after check out, and helped me get a taxi. Taxi to Caltrain Station at 4th and Townsend was $7.50. Good strong morning coffee and fresh danishes were cutely arranged in the tight reception area to take and enjoy in your room. Sutter between Leavenworth and Hyde is not glamorous, but there's enough car traffic that I never felt unsafe. Milthila is between a laundramat and a grocery store; across is a Mexican restaurant. Tip: Hotels near Union Square and attractions are pricey per quality, so consider staying elsewhere where the Muni is easily accessible for better deals per comfort. TRAVEL HAPPY!!

<Content>A really enjoyable stay I believe some reviewers here must be hunting down the best prices in town and then comparing the accomodation to the Hilton. DUH. We were looking for a hotel with private rooms for as cheap as possible in San Francisco, as we were on a really tight budget, and it was a really last minute booking, so we were kinda asking the impossible.When I first found Mithila it was booked up, but after a few more hours of unsuccessful searching I found a cancellation on [--], so took it straight away.Arriving late at night, tired and with heavy backpacks and bags, we rang the bell and a guy came straight out, welcomed us and got all our luggage up the narrow stairs to reception.Here the guy was very welcoming and helpful, gave us a city map, explained transport options and told us to ring the bell anytime if we needed anything.Ourn room was a pleasant surprise, and far better than we expected at this price. NOT the Hilton, but a decent size, very clean ensuite bathroom with clean towels, fresh toiletries and abundant hot water. There was TV (though not an inspiring channel selection) and fridge, iron/ironing board and hair dryer, all clean.The building itself is, as described, an older continental style hotel - rather faded, but certainly comfortable and clean. Finally, we just couldn't believe how well located the hotel is. Union Square and Chinatown easy walking distance. Plenty of theatres. Close to many transport options, yet at night the district is really quiet, so you don't have to wear earplugs to block out traffic noise. The only noise problem we had was from 2 German girls staying in the next room on one night, who wrre apparently unaware that they were not the only people in the building, but this is not the fault of the hotel.I couldn't find any better rates in SF unless you wanna stay out of town, or in a hostel. For me the Mithila is excellent value, and if we return to SF I will happily book here again.

<Content>Good, for the price Don't believe the bad reviews about this place. The rooms are clean, linens changed daily, staff helpful, and some of the rooms are on the quiet side of the building--surprising for this noisy city and busy location. The guests tend to be European tourists of all ages, including families, or Americans traveling on a budget. They are pleasant, interesting, even fun. The rooms come with fridge, microwave and dining table. The hotel is near many grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants and all manner of public transportation. The neighborhood is not the best, nor is it the worst. Skip the continental breakfast and explore the affordable restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel for breakfast instead. The lowest prices at this hotel are for rooms without private baths, but for $20 above the base price, you get a private bath. No air conditioning, but rarely does one need it in San Fran. Other hotels I've stayed in that, like this one, are within walking distance of downtown, are much noisier, depressing, and don't provide the extras: fridge/microwave, wi-fi. Sure, there are better hotels, but not at this price. Enjoy your stay.

When I looked behind the curtains, I discovered mold growing on them!! The window lock was broken. Although it is close to Union Square, it is a rough part of town. Walking these streets at night is not safe. The free pastries as disgusting! I would not eat them if they paid me to!

<Content>I loved it here! My husband and I spent five nights here last April during our California road trip. This was a terrific place to stay as the price was very reasonable and the location is great! Our room had a microfridge, hairdryer, iron, alarm clock, telephone, and a bathroom with an actual bathtub! Unlike other places the wireless internet actually worked well and the free breakfast (muffins, crossaints and danishes) was a definite plus.The Mithila is really close to Union Square, the Cable Car lines, and Chintatown where you can find tons of cheap stuff. I definately recommend this hotel to all travelers and can't wait to come back next year!

<Content>Shockingly filthy, Fecal stains-most prostitutes won't go there....except.. I stayed there for a single night of horror. First off, the man with filthy greasy hair a the registration desk -armored with break proof lexan, insisted on running my credit card before I could see the room saying that he was fully booked. A liar. Most of the hotel was empty. But not the two rooms on either side of me. One room next to us smelled like ether from a freebasing Afganistan prostitute (clearly a juvenile no more than 12-3 years old)and her 50 year old scar faced lover/pimp who came down stairs at the 2am only to eat a stale donut and vomit in the breakfast trash bin in front of other guests. Another regular was a chain smoking bald guy who never changed his adult diapers- fecal smears were left on seats he sat on-Jeans soaked through- he was our other neighbor. I tried in vane to book another hotel but it was after midnight and no one was answering phones. Distressed more than we could stand it, we abandoned this hotel at 3am and took a cab to the airport 13 hours before our flight. While Leaving the hotel a few ladies of the night laughed at us for staying there-and told us even worse experiences- they obviously knew better than to go there. We slept much better on the floor in the airport- but by the time we had arrived at the airport my wife was already showing bites from fleas or bedbugs.The hotel toilets there are ancient with no water flow. The hotel manager unclogs them with his bare hands... I could not believe it...and this guy would be putting out the breakfast..hepatitus would be included with the wifi I suppose. QuentinTarintino could not have depicted worse squalor. The hotel manager was completely indifferent to what was going on.

<Content>Best Location and Value in SF Mithila Hotel describes themselves as a charming European-style hotel located in the heart of downtown San Francisco... an excellent value. I wouldn't disagree with any of these claims.In addition, I think that some reviewers have even been a bit unfair in their evaluations.I've noticed an astounding number of negative feedback on Mithila on this website, and I have to say - of those saying that staff were misleading on the website, it's just not true. European style? you bet - small hallways, an old, but Perfectly Functional elevator, sure. Just like in Europe. Those of you who have been to Paris before, for example, know this.Location - you really have to look on a map to understand how well located Mithila hotel really is, and know that for this price, you cannot expect to find anything else anywhere near the central districts that could possibly be rated better.San Francisco is expensive, labor costs are steep - and as Mithila Hotel is quite cheap, logically then, amenities are limited. Don't be surprised if you have to ask for more shampoo when it runs out. Just a simple request will do.As for the rooms, we have stayed 3 times, in different rooms, and have not had any problems - rooms were clean and decent. Of course, not all the rooms have Victorian bay windows like in the pictures - it's just not possible. The hotel is much deeper than it is wide, with a long hallway. I can't vouch for all the rooms - just the ones we stayed in, though I imagine the other rooms are comparable.And one last comment about the continental breakfast. Yes, there is only coffee and danish rolls or donuts for breakfast (they also had oatmeal packs when I was there.) But you don't have to be an experienced traveler, just a budget traveler, to know that continental is very rarely more than that. If you were looking for more, you'd have to look in a different price range!Several visitors have sited poor service. I think this is an overworked staff trying to keep up a value hotel in one of the most expensive cities. It's harder to be nice back to people when they are demanding either the impossible or simply don't understand where you're coming from!I know that if we find ourselves in SF again, and we're on a budget, we're done shopping - we'll be staying at Mithila Hotel.If you too consider yourself a low-maintenance budget traveller, Mithila Hotel is a good choice.

<Content>Awful! don't stay here A friend and I stayed here for 4 nights recently - April 2007. The whole hotel was smelly and dirty. It needs renovating for a start... The worst part was that our room smelt of urine and some other unknown bad stench...After booking a double room we were put in a single room, or had to face paying an extra 15USD per night. Also, on arrival i had to sign a form to say we weren't allowed to burn candles in the room or smoke (which is fine! although we were tempted to buy scented candles! even though the only thing to get rid of the smell would be to burn the whole place down!) but the piece of paper stated that these things could damage their LOVELY rooms - lovely ha!The complimentary breakfast was a pot of coffee on a tiny table opposite the reception desk.The location is ok - it's the only positive point i can think of. fairly easy to get to other areas.On our last night, the toilet leaked and flooded the bathroom and some of the carpet by morning. I'm sure this must have been a problem before and contributed to the bad odour in our room and throughout the hotel. I would not consider staying in this hotel again. even if you're on a tight budget, don't bother. go to the York next door, or search for another cheap hotel. I've stayed in many cheap hotels and this is one of the worst.

<Content>Don't bother I gave this hotel a benefit a doubt, even some reviews. The room had a strong order of ciggs. It was really gross. I left my window open the whole time I was there. The carpet, bed, furniture, linen, and curtain were really gross and old. One point I left the hotel with my boyfriend, but forgot his cellphone. I had to buzz back to get in, while my boyfriend waited downstairs. When I was heading to my room, the hotel staff at the front desk question the guy, waiting downstairs. I felt threatened, as if I have done something wrong. I couldn't sleep well, because the bedsheets made me itch. If you want a bargain, this is the hotel for you. You might have to put up with a smelly room, if you never asked for a smoke-free room. Endure questions of your every move and itchy sheets. The good side is it located near downtown/Union Square.

<Content>Not very pleasant Mithila is inexpensive compared with other hotels in the same area. But you get what you paid for. What I really disliked about Mithila is that they tried to get you to pay more every chance they got. Remember to bring cash if you get a good rate. They don't accept credit card for that.My room reeked of cigarette smoke. When I talked to the manager, I was told that is because I did not request a non-smoking room when I made the reservation. He went on saying even if I requested a non-smoking room, they don't have to honor it unless I pay more for an upgrade. So I had to have the windows open day and night. Even after one week, it still smelled. The hotel provided shampoo when I first arrived. Because I stayed for five days, the shampoo ran out and they never replenished it. Remember to bring your own when you stay for more than a couple of days.Free continental breakfast was just a box of donuts with a pot of coffee. If you get up a little late, you are out of luck.You need to pay to use their wireless internet service. I was able to link to a nearby wireless server for free although it was a little slow.

<Content>THIS HOTEL IS A FRAUD The week I spend in this hotel was the worse I have ever had in an hotel, and I have traveled a lot. The description provided by this hotel is a complete lie.Do not trust the pictures. 'A Charming European Hotel?!!!!'. THE CONTINENTAL BREAKFASY IS A JOKE. few pastries lined up in a corner of the lobby. My room was dark and dingy. Not so clean.If you are used to the worse, you may find the place OK because it is not smely. However, for anybody used to decent places this hotel is A FRAUD. You can find other hotels at similar prices in San Francisco and you should pass your way.

<Content>not worth it Having been a guest at this hotel and enduring the unfriendly service, malodourous and uncomfortable atmosphere there, I strongly advise anyone traveling to this lovely city to spend a little extra and find a nicer more welcoming place to stay. My friend and I had to pay extra for me to sleep on the floor with a futon they gave me. We should have saved our money and just slept on the floor it was so thin. For the extra money they didn't even make it in the morning! We were uncomfortable about booking our tours through the hotel and booked at a welcoming hotel down the street. Our clothes were so infiltrated by the odour in the hotel we had to wash many of our clothes we had taken for our 7 week trip at our next destination. Breakfast was a pastry outside the office (we opted for other arrangements). Ours and another rooms toilets blocked at midnight. No gloves in sight...rather unhygienic. This was without doubt the most uncomfortable and horrible place in the 7 week period that we stayed in. No other place came close at all.

<Content>Please DO NOT go here! This hotel is a joke. 2 doors up there is another hotel that is 100 times better. We arrived at the hotel early in the morning and were greeted by the must unusual of smells. A mix between curried papadams and incense. The guy behind the desk was very unhelpful and grudgingly said he would look after our baggage until the room would be ready. Returning at 3pm for check in we discovered the room had only 1 bed when we had asked for 2 doubles. The man at the desk said we could purchase a futon for an extra $35.00 for two nights. My friend later referred to this as the floor bed as it was like sleeping on the floor. Later that night our toilet blocked up and was overflowing the family who run the hotel all came to help, which was very embarrassing and using no gloves proceeded to unblock the toilet. They then informed us that breakfast would be served downstairs the next morning. Hygiene aside we had already decided to breakfast elsewhere. We were so appalled by the state of the hotel and the unfriendliness of the staff that we booked our tours through the hotel up the street. Other guests we talked to on leaving said it was the worst experience of their lives. The picture on the net doesn't even look like the hotel. It's almost like they have taken a different hotels picture. On my world trip out of 20 hotels this was undoubtly the worst. Next time your in San Fran give it a miss. It's just not worth it.

<Content>Cheating and Impolite Don't waste your money. I hate San Francisco because of this hotel. The male receptionist offered free 1-night parking. After I paid my money, he said that I could park on-street and that he also parked his Lexus (Cheating). Therefore, I had to pay for parking myself. I paid for 1 extra bed, but he impolitely said that other staff were absent and he could not bring the bed for us, even though I paid for 3 guests. The hotel was dirty and has no air-conditioner. I confirmed that it is the truth. You can contact me.

<Content>Good thing we were drunk! Once arrived to check-in at hotel after being misdirected by hotel staff told to double park in front of hotel and check in. Once at hotel was told to park car in garage conviently three blocks away,meaning we were going to carry all luggage uphill back to hotel. NOT COOL. Pack lite. Watch your step(out of elevator) many uneven landings and steep stair cases. Felt like mouse in cheese maze going thru hallway to locate our room. The room size was is so small we had to rearrange furniture so we could put our luggage on the ground so we could sleep on the bed. Room was far from spotless, including bloody spot on shower curtain, and silver-dollar size burn mark in blankets. The smell in the whole hotel was so strong with meldew and incense we wanted to open the windows but there was no screens on the windows, not good for our children. If looking for a nice romantic hotel or plain nice hotel this is not the hotel for you. FYI: No ice or vending machine available.

<Content>awful You have to carry your luggage up a long flight of stairs. The hotel was locked. We waited outside for ten minutes ringing the buzzer. We were finally buzzed in. At the counter the check-in person there in pyjamas proceeded to argue with us for 20 minutes over the price we booked online.The room was DISGUSTING. filthy carpet, ratty furniture. But even worse was the smell - like mold everywhere. The next day I could still smell the musty smell from the night before. We checked out early the next morning and the staff argued with us some more about the rate we paid until we paid them more. If I had more time I would have reported them to the BBB.The breakfast was a complete joke. A tray of plastic wrapped junk pastries and coffee. They had a whole stack of the plastic wrapped pastries behind their desk. A HORRIBLE HOTEL - AVOID AVOID AVOID. There are much better values in San Francisco. Even if you have to pay $20 more - DO IT! This is not the charming hotel they advertise.

<Content>You get what you pay for The best thing I can say about this hotel is that the location is very convenient, close to Union Square and some very nice bars and restaurants. It's also not very expensive and reaffirms the idea that in life, you get what you pay for.The breakfast turned out to be a dry Danish and truly undrinkable coffee, the room had very visible wear and tear, no toiletries in the bathroom and the towels were small, old and stained!Having said that, we didn't let it ruin our trip as we kind of expected that and we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway. The bottom line is, if you have money to spend got somewhere else but if you're looking for a cheap hotel and central location that I guess the Mithila will have to do.

<Content>No Bed  Although a very good bargain for San Francisco, and located within walking distance to Union Square, this bare-bones hotel definitely does NOT fit the description or live up to the name of a bed and breakfast.With no lobby, the glassed-in office is a walk up a flight of stairs (or a ride on a very rickety old elevator). No sign of any common gathering area.Our room was very clean. Even the bathroom had shiny tile in the shower and the chrome was polished, the floors were clean. No signs of bugs when we turned on the lights (believe me, from the halls and the outside of this hotel, I would have expected to find bugs). But no complaints about the cleanliness of the room.Once checked in, we called the desk to inquire about breakfast. We were told that there was no place for the guests to gather and have breakfast. Rather, there would be sweet rolls and coffee outside the office in the morning. Next morning, we learned that this consisted of one box of grocery store Danish pastries and one pot of coffee. If you didn't get there early, you were out of luck.Our main complaint, however, was about the linens. The one blanket on the bed was pilled, old and stained. The bottom sheet was not fitted, and kept coming off in the night. We were not very comfortable sleeping on the mattress cover with no sheet half the night. The top sheet had a hole in it.The towels were thin and rough. The first day, one of the towels actually ripped it was so worn out. We had an extra blanket in our car and ended up bringing it up to the room rather than use the blanket provided. When we complained about no fitted bottom sheet, they did replace our bottom sheet with a bigger flat sheet and the sheet didn't come off in the night.A good bargain, but next time, we'll pay a little more and get a nicer room.

<Content>not worth the trouble or should I say the money. The only good thing: our room was almost quiet, i.e. we didn't hear traffic from the street. The room was poorly cleaned, old furnishing, dusty. Staff unfriendly. Were duped into extra payment by the night porter upon arrival late night after an intercontinental flight, due to internet booking difficulties with our booking we had made some weeks earlier. So sweet the hotel looked on its own internet page - no charm behind this house number. Still, this region of SFO is superb, try to find another hotel, there're plenty.

<Content>Not that bad My parents came to SF for my wedding and we had to find not-so-expensive accomodations for them. After reading some of the reviews of Mithilda I was very sceptic, but the prize was right, so I booked it. My parents enjoyed their stay there. It's not fantastic, but it'll do. It's clean, it's inexpensive, it is a good location, in a ok-safe neighborhood. Who needs a lot of TV stations when being in a city as great as SF? You will not find anything better in a better location. It is loud whereever you go in the city! The breakfast, I have to say is not continental -it's coffee and danishes. Their website makes the rooms nicer then they are, but again, they are not bad and quite roomy. I am still recommending it to friends coming to visit.

<Content>Good choice We were planning a family trip to San Francisco and didn't want to spend all our money on a place to sleep. One option was staying at one of the less expensive places out near the airport or in South San Francisco, but then we'd have the expence (and hassle) of bus or taxi rides back and forth, so we decided on staying downtown. We took BART from the airport, transferred to a bus and arrived within a block of the hotel on Sutter Street. It's a few blocks walk to the gate of Chinatown, a few more blocks to Union Square and the cable cars, two and a half blocks from a supermarket. All very convenient. The rooms are well-sized, as one would expect in a building as old as this. Everything is in working order, the beds are comfortable, naturally everything is clean. We had TVs and refrigerators in our rooms. The bathrooms have bathtubs! And of course you can take a shower instead, if you'd rather. Most rooms face away from the street, so are quiet. The staff is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the city. We felt appreciated as customers. In a city teeming with average hotels, the Mithila staff succeeds in pushing their place above average.

<Content>Not very good, not worth the money I was not at all impressed by this hotel, and even though it is only $85 a night, it's still not worth it. The sheets had, what lloked like small blood stains on them for the entire week, so obviously they do not shange the sheets, not even when we asked. The continental breakfast was a JOKE: really awful coffee and processed danish - if you got there in time. The area is ok, it is in the area between Nob hill and the tenderloin, which is the worst part of the city. The room was a decent size, but the Tv doesn't have cable and only gets about 5 channels with so-so reception. I would not recommend this place and shame on Orbitz for being affiliated with it.
