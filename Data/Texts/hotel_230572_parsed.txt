<Content>Lovely stay at the Grand Hyatt Berlin We're just back from a lovely weekend at this hotel. We booked the L'Amour package so we got BB plus champagne and strawberries on arrival (even though we checked in at 10.30pm). It's well worth getting one of their packages even if it's just to get the breakfast included in the price. The Hyatt breakfast was very good and we had it in our room each morning at no extra cost. The staff were all very friendly and helpful without being too forward. We got room service the first night. There wasn't much choice for vegetarians so I opted for spaghetti with sauce, which was quite boring. Luckily I also ordered a rocket salad which was very good. My partner got salmon and roast vegetables which he really enjoyed. The room itself (Grand King) was comfortable although not very big. The bed was very nice and it was possible to order extra pillows and bedding if required. We were happy with it as it was. There was a flat screen TV (Bang  Olufsen). There were also speakers in the ceiling of the bathroom which was cool. You could lie in the bath and listen to your tunes or watch TV as there was also a smaller flat screen TV in the bathroom. There's a connector cable provided so it's possible to plug your MP3 player or laptop into the system. My only complaint was that the bathroom had sliding doors. One opened directly beside the bed. None of the sliding doors sealed very well which meant there was very little privacy when you used the toilet etc.. The spa was very nice. It wasn't too busy so we had an enjoyable swim etc.. Wireless internet cost 50 cent per minute with a maximum charge of 鈧?8 for a 24 hour period.The location of the hotel is very good. It was clean and to a good standard. The only downside for me was that the bathroom didn't feel like a separate room. Overall we had a lovely time there and we would happily go there again. If you are going, look for a package which includes breakfast, it's well worth the little extra.

<Content>Loved the Grand Hyatt Berlin! We just returned from our vacation in Germany and our stay at the Grand Hyatt Berlin was one of the main highlights. We were fortunate to book the Max Reinhardt Suite/620. There are so many side benefits to booking this suite that the value is worth the extra price. Limo service to and from the airport, an amazing buffet breakfast (Vox-not to be missed) complimentary mini-bar, and many other meals, snacks and drink specials.All areas of service were exceptional, from the front desk to the various bars/restaurants. Completely modern in all phases, the room was huge, comfortable and spotless. Outside of a mattress that was pretty hard (not their usual Heavenly Bed) there are no complaints.Perfect location as well. Central to all the sights but within it's own distinctive area. Within walking distance of many of the best attractions and close to the U and S Bahn trains. There are enough places to eat or get a drink within 2 blocks of the hotel that you'll never have to worry about your next meal.I could go on and on but I'll just tell you to stay here when you visit Berlin. There's no doubt this is where we'll stay again if/when we ever return.

<Content>Boring but Brilliant This hotel purrs like a Mercedes. It's a silky smooth and comfortable machine that is wonderfully comfortable and only lacks something truly distinctive to set it apart from all the other contemporary hotels in redevelopments around the world.Got a great deal on the Hyatt website and booked into a king bedded Grand room. Bathroom with its wood-panelled sliding doors was great, lovely walk-in shower on great stone floor. Everything you need as ever.Flat-panel TV boasted the heaviest remote control I've ever handled. Lighting was great, bed was very comfortable. Sound proofing was perfect. Genuinely luxurious.The only thing is that it could have been anywhere really. My feeling is that it is just a bit too bland with its high empty ceilings in the common areas which were filled in with anonymous background music. The blandness doesn't matter too much and to be fair it does echo the general numbing blandness of the entire Potsdamer Platz redevelopment of which the hotel is a part.And at least they try with big red walls and friendly staff who just manage to retain the sense of personal service despite the corporate sense of the place. But this really is a minor gripe - the place is fantastically comfortable and a great stay. We didn't eat in the restaurants and nor did we try the fitness centre but it was a very-well appointed hotel in terms of facilities.

<Content>Great Service, Perfect Location The Berlin Grand Hyatt lives up to the GrandHyatt name.Location: very central for business and lesiuire traveller, around the corner there are rows of decent restaurants. The Concierge is excellent in recommending good restraurants. Dont' hesitate to ask. 5 mins to Posdamer Platz station. Mall, cinema and even Casino is around the cornr.Rooms: clean, sleek, grand. BO flat screen TV  sound system. not extremely spacious for our Grand Twin room.The bathroom is spacious with tub and a rainshower cubical.Bathroom amenties are from Aveda. But the housekeeping staff was very mingy, not putting new or additional shower gel and moisturizer, she just screwed the cap back and put them there. Very disappointing. The room offers a good variety of tea and coffee making facilities. Internet is NOT WiFi. 18 Euro per day.Didn't use the business center, so no idea about the efficiency.Breakfast at Vox, selection is impressive. THe service is immaculate. The doormen are very courteous, cheerful, they truly extend that welcome everyday, not just aiming for tips.All in all , it's a great choice for Berlin, We have got a reasonable rate of E295 for the room w breakfast. I consider it pretty good.We kept one of our bags with Grand Hyatt after checking out on our 4-day trip to Prague. The Bell staff are very acommodating, the doorman saw us return, without a word, he rushed to get our bag out. impressive.

<Content>One of the best hotels in Germany This is my preferred hotel for trips to Berlin and probably the best hotel in Germany. I love the minimalist, but functional clear design. The rooms are of modern design, but without the awkward feel of design hotels. They have managed to mix clear design with a cozy feeling so you just don't want to leave your room.The Vox restaurant is awesome, service in all areas of the hotel always top of the mark.

<Content>perfect Overall a great hotel. Position is excellent - 5 mins walk to the nearest train station, restaurants, shops and bars in the vicinity. Hotel itself was modern, quiet, clean, service excellent (got a kick out of a petite hostess lugging my bags around), nice spa. Excellent value for your money. In other cities a hotel of this level would have costed double. One small note - a printer connected to the internet computer would have been helpful (to print out airline check-in boarding passes)Highly recommended.

<Content>Great Location What an avant-garde hotel located right in the centre of Berlin - the room was large (I had a king size bed) with all the amenities one would expect from a hotel of this nature, including fresh apples every day. The bathroom was to die for - I wanted to take that home but it would not fit in my suitcase! Service in the hotel was exceptional from the door men, to the restaurant staff to the girls behind the front desk. Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent with freshly made eggs - any style. Plus all the items available looked fresh and delicious. One minor complaint - it would have been great to have an iron available or in the room. Location was super - just around the corner from the Potsdamer Platz, the Sony Centre and many shops. Further down were the Brandenburg Gate, The Holocaust Memorial and so much more.All in all, I loved this hotel and Berlin - Ich Bin Ein Berliner!

<Content>Not so Grand Would you expect a room in a hotel like this to have a connecting door to your neighbor? I didn't. So it was quite a surprise for me to hear him trade creche figurines over the phone late at night. Even more of a surprise was to hear from the night manager that I was the first person ever to complain...To cut it short: I had the chance to move to another room after pushing for it. As long as you make sure your room isn't connected to others it's a decent hotel in a convenient location for tourism and doing business with the government. Service in the Vox restaurant is good.

<Content>I love this hotel! I spent four days, three nights at the Grand Hyatt Berlin for a holiday weekend. It is wonderful!The staff--from the doorman, to front desk clerk, to the concierge, to the housekeepers--are courteous and friendly. The lobby Christmas decorations were tasteful and gorgeous. And the rooms were well appointed. I particularly liked the zoomy bathroom. I am a very light sleeper. The interior/courtyard room was perfect. I never heard street noise or another guest.The Potsdamer Platz location is outstanding. I heartily recommend this property and would love to stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel in Berlin - for everyone Absolutely brilliant hotel. I have stayed here for about 3 weeks in total this year. The rooms are enormous (could have a flat panel TV though!) and the best part by far is the bathroom - almost as big as the main room itself. I can't go on about the bathroom enough. LCD to watch TV in there, powerful walkin shower, stylishly decorated. An absolute pleasure. The staff are very attentive, and even when they walked in on me changing once (dry cleaning delivery), they apologised with a bottle of wine. The spa is great (I recommend the massages) and has a decent gym and sauna. The breakfast is excellent (I love the Earl Grey there) in the Vox restaurant. Vox has great food all day, and the best whisky list I have ever seen. It has a great vibe in the evenings. The hotel may be ugly, but the location, rooms and service is great. Highly recommended.

<Content>Best Hyatt we are family of four took two bedrooms connected for six days. Paid in advance for better price. We enjoyed the hotel and the area very much. Sony building next to it which was very enjoyable to the teens. I too ejoyed the Beer garden at the Soney Centre. Have used the Hyatt restruant several times which is very good. We prefer the one next to the reseption due to food and informal comparing to the large one indoors/outdoors. Can not remember the name.

<Content>Impression of two wolrd travellers (not on bussiness) Could not say enough good things about this hotel. It exceeds 4* expectation. It is quite modern hotel, with modern furniture and decorations. Staff is quite helpful and friendly. We were surprised to arrive in our room and find a bottle of Champagne, lovely truffles and a special note to us. A really nice touch. The breakfast buffet at the VOXX restaurant is great. They offer a variety of fishes, cheeses, and charcuterie. Lovely breads, fruits, juices, etc.  I would only say, if you are travelling for leasure, don't be surprised to see many business travellers.

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent service This was our fourth time at this hotel, and one of the nice things is that it doesn't change. The service is always good, and the rooms immaculate. We stayed in a club room on the seventh floor, with a good view. Breakfast is included - comprising a buffet of cold meats, pastries and beverages. We arrived early, and they offered us coffee and to look after our cases whilst we went out until the room was ready. They also offered us a complimentary extension of our room until 2pm on our day of departure. Rooms are modern and well thought out, with very comfortable beds. The location is also good, as it is basically in the middle, so you can easily head east or west, either on foot or via the underground which is nearby. Overall, very good, and whilst not cheap, it represents value for money.

<Content>Still My Global Favourite I have stayed at this hotel a few times since 2004 and in travelling the globe have found the service and expectation consistantly met every time.This stay was a Hyatt reward on the club floor but have paid full pricing on all my previous visits, the big attaction for tired business travellers would have to be the outstanding fitout of all the rooms and the soundproofing. You will get a good sleep here....We used the clubroom for breakfast the staff were friendly although breakfast at the hotel restaurant Vox on the ground floor is the way to go for choice that can't be beaten although it is fully priced accordingly.Walking Berlin is great but lunch in the hotel restaurant cafe was was a great experience and reasonably priced.I had the hotel do laundry on Saturday afternoon for my night on the town and they turned around casual clothes and business shirts etc in under 3 hours with better than my mothers effort on the ironing.We both found the staff friendly and not at all snobby for this standard of accomodation. If you are a design and interiors buff then you won't go past this hotel - Make sure you take the private lift up to the day spa and pool on the top floor the view ver Berlin is great.On pricing the food and extras are mid range compared to other European capitals with only breakfast seeking top euro figure.

<Content>Modern design, friendly staff I have to concur with the the majority of the reviews for this property, for a 4-night stay with my wife in Dec. The hotel was a little bit hard to find if you take the U-bahn or S-bahn to Potsdamer Platz, but it's no big deal. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a Club floor and the front desk staff personally have us a brief tour of the hotel facilities and our room. She was very friendly and professional - a nice touch. The hotel itself is quite new, with a modern sleek design. It's a 2 minute walk to the Blueman Group theater, shopping mall and casino. There are also MacDonalds and Starbucks if you're so inclined. The Potsdamer Platz area is within walking distance (about 20 min) to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag. All in all, highly recommended!

<Content>As good as all the reviews say We have used and enjoyed the Hyatt Club floor arrangement before, and were not disappointed in Berlin, which is a magnificent city and so worth a visit. The Club level rooms are very comfortable, spacious and quiet and have gorgeous bathrooms. The Club lounge set-up is excellent, continental breakfast is available - very generous, altho no hot food - cakes/snacks from 3pm to 5pm (most people are out sightseeing) and a 'buffet' from 6pm until 8pm. Not the biggest buffet in the world, but more than enough for us. Free wine/beer/sparkling wine during these two hours also, and very generous amounts. The club lounge was a home from home and we relaxed there in the evenings over a couple of glasses of wine, before having an evening stroll and then turning in after a day's sightseeing. Berlin is a must-see city and don't forget Potsdam - a history buff's treat - and the Hyatt is the place to stay. We loved it. Buy the 2 or 3 day transport pass for 18 or 22 euros, you can hop on and off U-bahns, S-bahns and buses all day.

<Content>WoW, what a great hotel! I went on a big European family vacation this summer with the whole clan (four adults, three kids, four countries, 3 weeks), and one of the highlights was the Grand Hyatt in Berlin; by far the best hotel in a trip filled with wonderful stays. I apologize for the length of this review in advance, but I just can't say enough about this amazing place.What a gorgeous hotel, and just what you imagine Berlin might be: stark, modern, clean, and efficient (such a nice change from the old world feel of all the hotels in Rome, Paris and London). I don't know a lot about Berlin (it was my first visit), but this hotel is really in a great area to explore. There are numerous museums, a big shopping mall, a huge live theater (Blue Man Group had just opened), an IMAX theater (and film museum), all within blocks of this hotel (and the kids loved the Mc Donald's next door!). Oh, and and the Starbuck's right across the street was nice too.We had three rooms in total: my folks had a one-bedroom corner suite on the third floor and we had two separate (two queen bed) rooms on the concierge floor (I think the 23rd floor). The suite was a real gem, with a nice view out of the corner living room that overlooked the front entrance of the hotel. The mini bar was COMPLIMENTARY (the kids loved this, as they had been forbidden to enter the mini bars in any of our previous hotels!), and there was even a stocked bar with liquor as well as a complimentary bottle of wine (my dad cracked this open right away) and a beautiful bowl of fresh fruit and cheese. There was also a DVD player with a BOSE surround sound system in the living room (There was large selection of DVD's to choose from in the concierge club room as well, with lot's of family friendly entertainment). The floor to ceiling doors opened to a bedroom with a king bed. The decor was modern (almost cubist) and predominantly black (of course!), but suprisingly the room was not dark. Our rooms on the upper floors were just as nice for regular rooms. I loved the utterly modern feel of this hotel. walking down the hallways felt like you were in a futuristic sci-fi movie or on a spaceship. Even the do not disturb signs on each door is a push button light!The greatest thing about all of the rooms however: the bathrooms. Simply magnificent. I especially liked the overflow bathtubs... they are enclosed behind glass in a huge travertine shower the size of half the room. There is a notch cut out of the side of the tub so that you can fill the tub all the way to the brim, and let the water flow over the edge when you get in. To get to soak all the way to the chin is such complete luxury. There is also a flat screen TV and sound system to enjoy while soaking in the tub! I really want to copy that bathroom in my house.As great as the hotel was, the real star of this property are the people. The staff was magnificent, with perfect english (with just the slightest accent, of course!), and a true dedication to service. No request was ignored or delayed, no employee encountered without a smile and warm hello. A lovely young woman escorted us personally to our rooms and explained all the features and amenities. And did I mention everyone is gorgeous!? There must be a rule that you can't be over 30 to work in this hotel, they all looked like models. The men were even better looking than the women! *sigh* I love Germany.The concierge room was a real treat. Each day it is the offical breakfast room (included in the room rate). With a lovely continental cold breakfast buffet set up. The coffee is fantastic, with a lovely froth on top from the machine. The wait staff is attentive and always close by. The selection of breads, pastries,  cereals was good and there was also fresh fruit and always a fish and meat selection as well. Oh, and an unexpected bonus for Europe: the room is completely NON-SMOKING for the breakfast service! A lovely way to start the day. In the afternoon, the selection turned to tasty  savory cold appetizers and pastries. Also Coffee, tea and all kinds of soft drinks and juices to try (the banana nectar is great!). And a staff always eager to serve.Small touches abounded: when we arrived in the concierge club room the first morning for breakfast, we started to push two tables together because our party was large and all the tables were set for four. Well, the staff politely informed us that they would be happy to do it for us, and also that they would have it set up for us in advance each morning of our stay... and so it was the next morning all set up when we walked in. When we left on the final day (sadly) we had rented a large van for the drive to Munich. When we returned to the hotel and loaded up, checked out and finally got ready to go... one of the doormen came out and presented each of us with a large bottle of water to have for our long trip! I was amazed at how considerate this was.One more bonus I forgot to mention... my Dad travels a lot for business, and our entire stay was free with his Hyatt Gold Passport points!The worst thing about our stay is that it was too short... only two nights. The city of Berlin is huge and there is so much to see. I can't wait to go back! I can only hope I'm fortunate enough to stay at the Grand Hyatt again.

<Content>Liked the Grand Hyatt Berlin very much We were a group of eight friends and spent five nights at the Grand Hyatt in Berlin, which we liked very much in everyway. The location of the hotel is very convenient to many Berlin ventures. The hotel itself is new, modern, decorated in a minimalist way and everything functions very well. Service ALL OVER THE HOTEL is just excellent. It seems as if they have chosen the prettiest, most polite, smiling and well-groomed young professsionals in the country to work in the hotel. Our rooms were near the elevators, which is convenient, they were quite big in size (especially the bathroom area) although storage space could have been a little bigger.Other than that they were very well equipped and the staff of the hotel fulfilled every demand we expressed right away. The breakfast buffet every morning was one of the best I have encountered in the top hotels I have stayed in the world. All in all we had a really enjoyable stay. I would highly recommend the Grand Hyatt.

<Content>Memorable stay I just returned from spending three nights at this hotel on business. I've stayed at a lot of hotels all over the world and this is definitely up there with the best. The service is quite likely the best (and most subtle) I've ever experienced. In fact, everything about the hotel is non-intrusive. The rooms with glorious bathrooms, Aveda amenities, a swimming pool that was all mine every morning I used it, a plentiful buffet breakfast surpassed only by Hotel Arts in Barcelona, a Herald Tribune AND USA Today readily available...In short, a terrific hotel in a fabulous location. If I have any complaints at all it would have to be the coffee. It's just not that good. But that's not a problem as there's a Starbucks across the street...

<Content>Brilliant hotel that made our city break a holiday Stayed here for 3 nights in March. Great location between Zoo (which isn't so nice) and Mitte (which was great) and on good bus route (no.200). Very friendly service. Nice big, modern rooms, had view over Philharmonie, with great bathroom. Spa was fantastic - beautiful pool, great sauna/plunge pool section and relaxing treatments available. All restaurants and the bar were great, if you want to stay in for food although its also nearby to other great eateries (try Lutter  Wegner over the road, which invented the term Sekt). Overall it really made this city break a proper holiday, although it is certainly not cheap but we felt worth splashing out on.

<Content>My favorite hotel in the world I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt Berlin several times now and it is my favorite hotel in the world. The facilities and staff are excellent. The rooms are modernist but elegant. The rooftop spa is fantastic, with a pool, whirlpool, dry and wet saunas and spa services. There are a few restaurants and bars in the hotel itself and right outside the door is Potsdammer Platz with lots of shops, restaurants, movie theaters, museums and bus and train transportation. It is a quick walk to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag. The staff is highly professional and will help you with any questions you might have during your stay. Everything about the hotel is first rate!

<Content>Top rate I recently stayed at this hotel for two seperate nights - one on a standard floor and one on the club floor. Both stays were excellent. The club floor provides a continental breakfast and continuous snacks and drinks throughout the day. The hotel staff is very courteous and helpful. The lobby and rooms are very nicely furnished and decorated. The bathroom itself was almost as big as some hotel rooms that I have stayed in in Europe. The hotel itself is right on the Potsdamer Platz. There are some restaurants, shopping, and nightlife activities in the area but they do not seem overly popular. However, the main shopping, restaurant, and siteseeing area (Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Unter Der Linden)is a 10-20 minute walk from the hotel. There is complimentary internet access in the downstairs business center as well as the club floor lounge. In-room access is available for a fee. The only downside is the floor layout. It can be a long hike to your room if you are not near the elevator bank. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are not overly price sensitive.

<Content>Overall a good experience This hotel is fine for a business stay in Berlin, as the staff is very kind and professional, the lobby is quite impressive, the location is great (on Potsdamer Platz, home to theatres, clubs and malls) and there are all services you might need.On the other hand, it has nothing really distinctive, it is not at all charming. Even the well known Vox Bar is nothing special; prices are low, but nothing really exciting or new is going on.The rooms are warmly furnished and everything is quite new. The shower room is great, but I didn't really like the position of the only one closet in the room (it is inside the bathroom!).Breakfast is a plus for this hotel, as it is really complete and freshly prepared. This should be a standard for a 5* hotel, but I did not find this level of service everywhere.

<Content>Didn't find much 'Grand' about this Hyatt I just returned from Berlin, where I stayed at both the Grand Hyatt and Intercontinental Berlin and I was a bit disappointed with the Grand Hyatt. As with most Grand Hyatts the hotel is well located, and the lobby is impressive. The staff is courteous and professional, but as I've found with other Hyatt's throughout the world I also found them too formal and stiff.I stayed in one of the 'Club' rooms on the 7th floor and the room was nicely furnished and very contemporary. But it was also quite small, and had little closet space.In addition, although I requested a 'non-smoking' room, and the room I was assigned was supposed to be a 'non-smoking', it had a strong stench of smoke and booze that would not go away, and since the hotel was overbooked, there were no other rooms I could move to.The gym on the top floor of the hotel is nice, but not the 'greatest' gym in Berlin (I would say Holmes Place as well as others are much, much better). Finally, the hotel was very expensive, and definitely not worth it. When I go back to Berlin I will stay at either the Intercontinental or Starwood properties, much nicer and worth their price.

<Content>I love this hotel! This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! I want my house to be as nice as this! It is in a great location and the hotel is spacious and comfortable. The rooms are amazing with their state of the art design and practicality. Stay here if you can - for business and pleasure!

<Content>fantastic This is a great place. Good location on the Marlene-Dietrich-Platz. It has a very stylish lobby, everything looks very clean and tidy. My room was a view overlooking M-D-Platz, on 3rd floor and not too noisy. Spacious oom with full-length windows. Wet-room rather than bathroom - very nice indeed. Restaurants and room service as well as housekeeping great too. The top-floor health club is full of very good equipment and treadmills have great view across Berlin rooftops so not boring! I cannot think of anything bad to say or even so-so, I enjoyed it so much.

<Content>Top class Had a hard time choosing between the Grand Hyatt, Adlon, and the Ritz Carlton. Berlin's a great city where you can stay at a 5 star world class hotel for reasonable prices compared to other cities in europe (i.e., Paris, Venice). Recently stayed here 3 nights. Everything is top quality including services, restaurants, health club/spa, and location. Located in the heart of Potsdamer Platz, you have multitude of shopping and restaurant choices. Also, the Philharmonie (home of the Berlin Philharmonic) is just across from the hotel. The hotel is one stop on the S-Bahn from Unter den Linden and a few U-Bahn stops from Kurferstendamm. Although the quality of Hyatt hotels is pretty variable in the US (except for Park Hyatts), I've found that Grand Hyatt hotels are excellent (truly 5*) in europe and asia and this is no exception. The rooms are modern and clean with nice bathrooms (seperate bath/shower but only one sink in vanity). My only small semi-negatives would be that there is nothing overly special about the room itself (minimalist) and internet access is a bit expensive (18euros/day). I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A top choice A group of us travelled to Berlin to see Robbie Williams in concert and needed a room for just one night. After lots of research we chose the Hyatt Berlin and were more than pleased with our choice. The staff were both professional and friendly. Our rooms weren't huge but were great, the bathroom was definitely a highlight as was the Aveda products they had provided. Smaller details that made that bit of difference were noted - lots of hangers, some silk and padded, chocolates, fruit, the playstation. The reception bar was swish and welcoming even with lots of German celebrities and camera crews about us. The doormen were wonderful - one even made sure our taxi stopped off at a coffee shop as we'd tried to get a starbucks and it was shut. The beds are SO comfortable, if I could have stolen the pillows, quilts AND the bed I'd have done so ;0) A very pleasant and much needed sleep after such a manic day and night in Berlin. The decor of the hallways reminded me of a typical boy's bedroom in the 80's - red/grey and white but other than that everything was tip top. I would highly recommend a stay here and would like to go back. The Vox bar is wonderful too - as are the wasabi peanuts they serve up!!

<Content>Superior choice in Berlin Stayed here for four nights in May in a club level room. I have nothing but good things to say about this property and my experience there. Although there is madness outside the hotel, being located in a very popular (and convenient) shopping and restaurant area, the hotel itself is cool, quiet, and without clutter. (In contrast to the other top end properties which are smack dab in the middle of the main tourist area). I found all the staff very helpful and professional. My room, although not large, had all the necessary amenities. The shower and tub area was fantastic, one of the best I have seen anywhere in the world. My a/c didn't work as well as it generally does in the US, but it was okay. It is definitely worth paying to upgrade to the club level because you get access to the club lounge. The meal presentations in there were just that - meals with lovely gourmet food at least three times a day. I found there was no need to eat in any restaurant during my stay. There is also a nifty coffee/espresso maker in there and access to cold drinks almost all the time. This is not your typical Hyatt! You can't go wrong at this property!

<Content>Good shopping and restaurant row near the Hyatt Recently I stayed at three hotels in Berlin. These were the Grand Hyatt, Radisson and the Sorat Art'otel. This one was the overall best. This hotel is very modern. The rooms are clean and nicely sized. The shower adjacent to the large tub in the bath is the same design used at The Grand Hyatt in Tokyo if you have been there. Probably the best Hyatt baths designed. You can manipulate the lighting a bit for a nice mood. I would have preferred a bubble bath rather than scented bath salts. Bring your own bubble bath. Adjacent to the hotel is a street lined with restaurants in various price ranges with outdoor seating under trees. One of the best streets in Berlin in my opinion. Restarants stay open pretty late too. Ajacent to this street is a large indoor shopping mall (three levels) nicely designed. Across the street is Potzdamer Platz with it's restaurants and Filmmuseum Berlin. Within walking distance is Checkpoint Charlie, Deutsches Technikmuseum (where I walked into a freight car used to transport jews to concentration camps) and the Mies van der Rohe designed Neu deisgned Nationalgalerie. Concert halls and motion picture multiplexes are in the area. The classy French department store Galeries Lafayette and the multi level mall attached to it is definately worth the walk. A lot of high end shops are within a couple of blocks of this store.The service from the bilingual staff was excellent. They sent ice to my room at my request a couple of times. Anthony, one of the bellmen, is from Chicago. Since I didn't know a word of German, he made a couple of calls for me so I could get some evening entertainment. This hotel has rather long hallways, however there was a nice lounge area on my fifth floor where a person could have a private conversation with visitors without having them in the room. You have to use your card in the elevator to get to your room.A word about exchanging money in Berlin. I exchanged money at the airport, central and east Berlin and at the hotel. Exchange rates matched very closely. German efficiency. Shopping around for rates isn't worth the time and trouble in my opinion.Definately consider this hotel for your Berlin visit.

<Content>modern luxury, centrally located We spent a long weekend in Berlin and booked a clublevel room, which is worth the extra Euros: wonderful breakfast and snacks for dinner: italian antipasti, different kinds of meat, excellent wine plus softdrinks all day long. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and are designed in a temporary style with all amenities you'd expect. The floor in the bathroom is heated, so are the mirrors. Plasma-TV in the bathroom. The beds and pillows are perfect. This is what I call heavenly. The staff were friendly with a it will be my pleasure attitude. Had lunch at the restaurant and enjoyed it. We will be back. The hotel is situated in Tiergarten at the Potsdamer Platz, a short walk to Bundestag and Unter den Linden and adjecant to the Phiharmonie.
