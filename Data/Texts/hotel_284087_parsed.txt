<Content>Very friendly and conveniently located This was exactly what I was looking for, on my first visit to Europe and Italy. A longtime friend and I took a whirlwind, low budget 5-day tour of Italy in Feb 2008. After much web research, I chose Hotel Il Bargellino for two nights, based on the reviews on how friendly Carmel and Pino were. The hotel definitely met the high expectations. The room was fine, and there was an outdoor roof patio area that was warm enough to catch some rays, even in February. Everything was nearby and very walkable: train station, ATM, groceries, laundry, internet cafe, vino store, gelato, street markets, pizzerias (low budget), bicycle rental (ride to Vinci!!!) - and of course the museums and the touristy area. Turns out that Carmel and Pino were on vacation, so the hotel was tended by their Italian friend Felice (who lived in Boston) and niece Rosita (from southern Italy). They were extremely helpful and friendly. By the second evening, we were comfortable enough with each other than Felice knocked on our room door to invite us down the hall to their kitchen for dessert, some wine, and a couple hours of conversation on Italian culture and more (including the Red Sox). This was a highlight of the trip. Thanks!

<Content>Fantasic authentic Florence hotel. Hotel Il Bargellino was terrific. The location is great--walking distance from the train station and close to center of Florence near the Duomo. Carmel, the proprietor, was most helpful prior to our stay. She reserved tickets to galleries for us ahead of time also.Her niece Rosita was managing the hotel during our stay, and she, too, was most helpful.Our room was great with antique furniture. Also, the rooms were very spacious. The terrace was nice for morning and evening relaxing. The kitchen was available to us for coffee and micro-wave use.In each room, there is a brochure that Carmel has put together for her guests. We found this most helpful, especially when deciding where to eat.The hotel is authentic Italy which makes is so very special in addition to the gracious proprietors who act as your own concierge.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel in Central Florence I have stayed at Il Bargellino twice and will stay there on future visits to Florence. Bargellino is a small hotel offering personal service, convenient location, and probably the best hotel bed I've ever slept on. The rooms are a good size and most have a private bath. There are a few rooms that share a bath down the hall, so be sure and ask about that. Many rooms open to a lovely terrace, where guests gather at the end of a day of sight seeing to exchange experiences and share a bottle of wine. Carmel and Pino are very accommodating and helpful with anything that you need. (There are mosquitoes in the summer, but if you let the hosts know, they can provide a device that you plug in you room to repel them. It really works.)

<Content>Wonderful friendly atmosphere We have stayed at Il Bargellino on 4 different trips to Florence. It first caught our attention because it was so convenient to the train station, but it now we feel like it is our Florence home. Carmel and Pino have always been gratious and hospitable providding us with whatever they could to make us comfortable. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and quite large. There is not a better way to spend a bright morning or a quiet evening then out on the terrace provided by Il Bargellino. You can email Carmel with your travel dates and she will setup your reservation at the hotel and at the local museums , so you have nothing to worry about upon your arrival. We have already recommended it to many of our traveling friends.

<Content>VERY nice This was our second trip to Italy.....Last time we stayed in a hotel north of Florence and bussed in daily but we decided this time we decided to stay in the old section of the city iteself.....We were glad we did.......We arrived late from Pisa but Carmen and Pino were there to receive us. Il Bargellino is a small hotel a short walk from the train station. The rooms were spacious and there is a 2nd story courtyard that was great for coffee in the morning. It was quite convenient to all the sites, easy walking to the Duomo, Uffizi etc. Carmen provided recommendations for restaurants to top off our days and directions as well. Though we only spent 2 nights before we moved on to Rome, we'll be back to both Florence and Il Bargellino!

<Content>Book early. This hotel is great. This hotel is a good buy for the price. Yes, it is not a four-star hotel, but it has a lot of pluses. The owners are very nice. They booked my museum reservations in advance. I got very prompt responses to my e-mail when planning our trip. Our room opened onto the terrace. It is wonderful to sit out there in the sun to sip your wine, write postcards, and meet the other guests. For animal lovers, they have a parrot who will keep you company on the terrace. Plus, the neighbor's cat will come visit you, even get on your bed if you ask.The hotel is in a great location within easy walking to the major sights. It is near the Mercato Centrale where you can buy wonderful fresh fruits, cheeses, and cold cuts for lunch or breakfast. We kept the food in the refrigerator in our room. We had access to the microwave. There is a nearby inexpensive cafe for breakfast with omelets and hugh bruschetta topped with flavorful tomatoes. We highly recommend this hotel for the budget minded traveler.

<Content>Couldn't Ask For More I just returned from a 7 night stay at the Il Bargellino and once again, I was truly sad to leave.The hotel was full when I originally planned to go so I rearranged my dates. I enjoy the hotel so much, I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when I'm in Florence. It is so charming and Pino and Carmel couldn't be nicer. They just have a way of making everyone feel comfortable and at home. During the day, Pino is working around the hotel singing Italian songs and in the evening, Carmel is socializing on their lovely terrace.Many of the guests spend hours on the terrace eating, sharing wine , telling stories, talking and laughing. I always meet such wonderful and interesting people when I am there and like myself, many are returning visitors. You will never feel alone at Il Bargellino. This trip was the first time I stayed in a single room and as usual, I was very pleased. It was spacious, bright, clean and the bed was very comfortable. I have stayed in many different rooms and they are all wonderful. I am never disappointed.I highly recommend this hotel. It is charming and friendly, the location is great and you always feel welcome. For a small hotel, I don't think you can ask for more!

<Content>Loved This Place! We found out about this hotel in Rick Steve's Italy 2008 book and it was WONDERFUL. Clean rooms, friendly fun people and close to everything! The patio and dinner with Pino was the best!Pino is one of the the owners (wife Carmel was in the states at the time of our visit) and he was fabulous! Very friendly and their full time staffer, Claudine was very sweet. The farthest thing was Ponte Vechio which was only a 25-30 min walk.

<Content>Truly Pleasant Stay at Hotel Il Bargellino My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel in April. We had a very lovely stay and we will definitely stay there again when we go back to Italy. Carmel and Pino are the perfect innkeepers. They made us feel very welcome. The room was very clean and opened up to a great community patio. It is centrally located and a quick walk to the train station.

<Content>Passable, but nothing special The hotel was generally clean, but really needs updating. The bathroom was strange, and not something you'd typically find in the US. The shower consists of curtain and a drain in the floor in the corner of the room. The terrace is beautiful, and combined with a bottle of wine, is a great way to spend the afternoon. The lack of included breakfast left us with the feeling the room was overpriced compared to other places we stayed in Italy.

<Content>Great central location to visit all of Tuscany Reading the other reviews, I noticed some guests had rather negative remarks. My wife and I did not experience any of this. The directions Carmel gave us were very clear and we were at the hotel about five minutes after exiting the train station on foot. One guest, who seemed a bit upset, said the directions led him to a nearby porno shop which he almost walked into. We saw the so-called porno shop鈥?which sold lingerie and toys. We could see very clearly what it was from the outside. If this guy almost walked into it, he had other things on his mind! By no means is the hotel located in sleazy neighborhood with a plethora of kinky establishments. We felt safe walking through the area at all times of the day and night.Our room was clean when we got there and kept clean by the staff every day---we stayed four nights. The bathroom was clean when we got there and was kept spotless throughout our stay. We did not smell any mildew. So sometimes you could not find someone at the reception area鈥?BFD. I鈥檝e been at five-star hotels with 40 staffers behind the front desk and could not get reliable information. Whenever we needed something we walked over to Carmel鈥檚 living room and asked for it and got it. Carmel told us everything we needed to know to get around, including the bus routes we would use in Florence.There is some debate among the two or three unhappy reviewers as to whether the Il Bargellino should be classified as a hotel or a hostel or a pensione or whatever. I agree it was not the Hilton. It was simply a very nice, clean, walk-to-anywhere-from place to sleep for 85 euros a night for those of us on a budget. If these people wanted a sterile place, destitute of any distinguishing qualities, then they should have stayed at a big chain hotel for 400 bucks a night.This place definitely had character鈥?the cat, the parrot, the owners, and most importantly the terrace were we met and had a beer with other very amiable guests鈥?and we did not lose a single night of sleep because of it. Obviously, character did not necessarily translate into charm for some. Some unhappy campers complained about the 鈥渘oise鈥?from the terrace. I hope it wasn鈥檛 us and the other friendly guests we spent time with on the terrace chatting about or daily adventures. Come on, one of the most oft mentioned features of this place on all the websites was the terrace; so any reasonable person would have deduced that other guests would hang out on the terrace to chug a beer or two after a long, exhausting day spent hiking from on tourist site to the next.Most significantly, let me say that its proximity to the train and bus stations make this hotel perfect for those of you that plan to use Florence as the base to visit the rest of Tuscany. We took the bus and train on day trips to Pisa, San Gimignano, Siena and Monteriggioni, among others.Finally, the owners have little to worry about. Of the 86 reviews on this site, only ten gave the hotel a review of three or less out of five. Of these, only five had really negative things to say. The other 76 guest reviewers rated the hotel at a four or five.

<Content>Charming Hotel - Welcoming Atmosphere My husband and I have just recently returned from a month long tour of Europe. Our last stop was Florence - which we spent six days and six nights. Pinot and Carmel made us feel welcome and allowed our group - there were 19 of us - to have nightly gatherings on the Terrace. The room my husband and I shared was romantic and the decor true to the Tuscan style. Carmel had taken the time to book our Uffizzi and Academia tickets for us which was a huge bonus considering the lineup we would have had to endure just to purchase the tickets let alone get into the galleries themselves. I was always happy to return home at the end of a long day knowing that we could relax and have great cafes and restuarants close to our door. We spent alot of time in 10 different cities and stayed at many different types of hotels and I can honestly say the Hotel II Bargellino was comfortable, clean and made the last part of our adventure relaxing.

<Content>Loved il Bargellino My husband and I just returned from two weeks in Italy. We loved Hotel Il Bargellino. The room was much larger than those we had at either the two-star hotel in Rome or the three-star in Venice. The hosts, Carmel and Pino, were very friendly. Our room was on the terrace-side of the hotel, so we did not have the room noise mentioned in some reviews. The location is great. While there is no breakfast provided, there is a bright, clean, friendly bar down the street where you can get breakfast (and drinks, snacks, and light meals throughout the rest of the day). The bed was very comfortable. Everything was clean. And the terrace was, as others have said, a great place to unwind. We loved the neighborhood cat, who wandered across the roof-tops, onto the terrace, and into any rooms left open. Also on the terrace was Carmel and Pino's parrot, who sat on a perch throughout the day.

<Content>Lovely hosts, but catered towards Americans The hotel is quaint with a lovely terrace and nice hosts, but seemed as if this place was more geared towards americans, with some surprise at guests that are not americans (i.e. us). This is probably due to the american wife of the owner couple. Unfortunately this made the hotel seem less diverse, whereas Florence is very diverse!!The rooms are large, but some features such as bathrooms do need updating. Breakfast is not included, which is a shame as many hotels in Italy offer it.

<Content>Incredibly noisy El Bargellino was a small, pleasant typically old time European hotel but it was noisy both inside and out. The street noise, nearly all night, was incredible and the sounds on the inside carried to all the rooms. Pino and Carmel need to replace the windows with some sound deadening ones so their guests can get some sleep and they need to pay better attention to their guests. We were not told of a planned transportation strike until we were ready to go on a day trip. We would definitely not stay there again in the front rooms on the street. The ones in the back might be quieter.

<Content>Carmel runs a great place! We had a wonderful stay with Carmel and Pino at Hotel Il Bargelino when we visited with our family in January '08. We found carmel through tripadvisor, and it turns out that she grew up about 4 blocks from where we live in Boston! She happened to be in town visiting her parents that week, so we met up and did all the booking pre-work in person, which saved everyone involved a bunch of money and effort.When we arrived in Florence, it was a brief and easy walk to the hotel. The streets are confusingly numbered in Florence (there seem to be old and new numbers, some of which are the same? Meh...in Boston we don't even bother with street-signs) but it's pretty obvious what building is a hotel and what building isn't...so we had no problem finding it after using some common sense.The hotel might best be described as a pensione. It's a charming, small, inexpensive place with great firm beds, clean sheets and great, enthusiastic hosts. However, it's not a hotel with a bar, pool and five-star restaurant....it's a traditional small European hotel. It's in an incredible location, and we even went out on the beautiful rooftop patio...which I'm sure is lovely in the summer, but is pretty cold on a rainy 5-degree day in January.We explored Florence, coming back to the hotel to take naps and plan our next outings.We stayed in three rooms, one with en-suite bathroom, one with just a bidet and shower, and one which used the common restroom. The restrooms were clean and well-kept. The en-suite bathroom was small but tidy, and there were beautiful antique armoires in every room, where you could put your suitcases or hang your shirts.They have just adopted a wonderful pet...err, parrot? Cockatoo? Well, big green bird...Leopoldo. He's a hoot, and likes to talk when he's awake.We loved Il Bargelino because it's a *real* place, run by *real* people. I believe travel is about immersing yourself in the culture and existence of a foreign place...to experience life from a totally different perspective. Hotel Il Bargelino is a place that lets you dive right into the heart of Florence.Buon viaggio!

<Content>Disappointed After having read the reviews about this hotel, I had higher expectations and I must say after my stay at this hotel this weekend I was disappointed. I am VERY unclear about where the good reviews are coming from! I would say that I am a very reasonable person, widely travelled, having stayed at a range of accomodations from hostels to 5* hotels. Sure, the hotel was centrally located, and directions to the hotel clear, but I agree with another reviewer that this hotel was more of a hostel than a hotel. The bathroom had a pungent, old, dank smell to it and it was a wet bathroom - ie - you had to shower right over the toilet without a tub. The bed was quite hard as well. As for decor, because it was raining outside, they had spread out a white bath sized towels on the floor which was damp and walked on and which we had to walk on to get to the stairs...not exactly inspiring. I walked by hotels closer to the center with much nicer lobbies that looked warm, newer and more comfortable for comparable prices (I asked). Because the doors to the rooms were so flimsy, in the morning we could hear their bird (they have pet parrot) shreaking and squacking and we could also clearly hear the lobby telephone ringing throughout the hotel at 2am in the morning. Although the man who owned the hotel in the end allowed me to pay for our two nights with a credit card, he grumbled about it, when I asked, he punched numbers into his calculator to say that because it was low season (鈧?5 per night for 3 people), I should be paying cash. I won't be staying here again.

<Content>Don't look anywhere else. This is the place to stay! My sister and I spent three nights at Il Bargellino. Carmel and Pino made us feel so welcome! Pino even gave me an umbrella which I used throughout our days in Firenze and later in Venice! The hotel was so comfortable, very comfy bed and pillows and a snuggly down comforter made us feel right at home! I highly recommend Il Bargelino. Can't imaging staying anywhere else. We were close to everything and walked all over Florence easily from the hotel. Realizing I had left a drawer full of person items in the bedside table, I called Carmel and she immediately sent them to me. Thanks, Carmel! I hope to return to your lovely hotel soon.Robin Leach, Tallahassee, Florida

Our room was very pleasant and furnished with interesting antiques. We had what must be largest bathroom in all of Europe. We walked to all the sights and found nice restaurants in the neighborhood. Carmel had secured reservations at the Uffizzi for us. We were sorry that Carmel was not there, but Pino was a charming host. The location is away from the crowds of the city center, but very easy walking distance to all that you might want to see. I highly recommend this charming hotel.

<Content>Best part of Florence We stayed for 3 nights and were disappointed that we could only book those 3 (no other nights available). The room was spacious with a real Tuscany tone. The hotel is located very close to all the sites but just off the path enough for a quiet night's sleep. Our hosts were so helpful, funny, and warm and truly opened up their hotel to us. Carmel and Pino are Il Bargellino and I would not think of staying anywhere else on our next trip to Florence.

<Content>Fantastic find I found Hotel Il Bargellino through Rick Steves' Italy guidebook, and what a find. I thought it might a little too far from the main sights, but Florence is compact and the hotel is just 10-15 minutes walk to the town center. Not a problem.We stayed in room 6 (I think), which is plenty big and has a huge bathroom (a lot of unused space, but that's not a complaint, just an obervation). The bed is comfy and big, and there's a small TV (handy for catching some Italian MTV). We met Yogita the cat when we checked in, which made me homesick for my cat. Perhaps sensing this, Yogi followed us right into our room like she was ours! Unfortuately, the weather was cold when we visited, so we didn't hang out on the lovely terrace, but on a nice night, it would be a great way to end the day. We did hang out with Carmel and Pino and other guests in the common area as Carmel regaled us with stories. She's a hoot, very personable and entertaining.Carmel will book reservations at the top museums for you; simply ask her when you book your room. Just let her know the time slots and she'll book for you for free.A great little hotel, would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Il Bargellino good hotel and a good value My sister and I found Il Bargellino listed in Rick Steves book on Florence. The room rate was very good-meaning we spent less than $115 per night for a double! The hotel itself is located a short walk from the train station and when we arrived, we were welcomed by Carmel, the owner, who was very friendly and gave us great advice and information! She even made reservations for us at the museums (free) before we ever got there!The hotel has a neat terrace and some of the rooms open on to the terrace. My husband and I had a room facing the street and there was alot of street noise, but it does die down eventually. We had no trouble sleeping. The bathroom was just down the hall, very clean, and we never had to wait, either. A 10 or 15 minute walk gets you to most sites-we never had to take a bus or taxi. All in all, a very nice hotel with friendly, courteous service. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved it and will return Il Bargellino is a gem. It has charm, is spotlessly clean, is convenient to all the major sights while being on a quiet street, and the owners Carmel and Pino are friendly and helpful. This is definitely the best place to stay in Florence for the price.

<Content>Il Bargellino forever! One of the best deals in Florence, a perfect location especially for those coming in on the train, and for those who want to take advantage of the wonderful central market. We had a room without toilet or bath, but found the showers and facilities right down the hall perfectly adequate, a bit like living in one's own home. Rooms on the street can be a bit noisy in the summer, but nothing a good pair of ear plugs couldn't block out. We were perfectly satisfied and would go back any time we plan to visit Florence.

<Content>Loved It Again Just returned from three weeks in Europe including one week in Florence at Il Bargellino. This was my second stay at the hotel. Carmel and Pino are such gracious hosts that there's no question about trying another hotel. But the terrace is also such a draw! Instead of returning to your hotel at the end of the day and facing four walls, drinks on the terrace with other travelers is such a delight. In several years of tramping around Europe I've never found a hotel experience I prefer to that of Il Bargellino.

<Content>Il Bargellino rocks! I loved everything about Il Bargellino. The location, the rooms, the outdoor rooftop living area were all perfect for a relaxing and memorable stay in Florence. Carmel and Pino are wonderful hosts and were so helpful in providing us insight on the best places to eat, shop, sightsee and thoroughly enjoy our stay. I'd recommend Il Bargellino to anyone visiting Florence for a day, a week, or a month!

<Content>We love it It was the first time we visited to Italy. And all the good reviews about this hotel was true. My boyfriend and I stay there for 5 days. The room was big, clean and best of all it has direct access to the terrace which we can have breakfast, lunch or drink there. It was very relaxing and also you get to meet other travelers in the hotel and exchanges travelling tips and stories. We took several naps in our rooms during the afternoon and was very quiet and peaceful. The hotel has a guest folder in each room and it listed all the usual tips like where to eat, grocery, shop etc which you can tell the owner were very thoughful. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>An Oasis in Florence This hotel is an oasis in Florence...with a beautiful terrace overlooking tiled roofs...crisp white sheets, clean bathrooms and a smile upon your check-in. Carmel and Pino, proprietors, were helpful in obtaining our tickets for the day, and in helping us get acclimated to the city. Buy a map...we were constantly lost and walking way out of our way, which was a treat also. Especially nice was the free wi-fi so we could catch up on our blog. Carmel and Pino made the stay so pleasant, there when we needed them and always giving us our privacy. I would definitely stay here again...close to the train station and also to David. After travelling for 4 months and staying in many hotels, the privilege of having a large terrace to relax on, right off our room, was really a pleasure.

<Content>Garden Terrace, best part of our trip We had a family of four, and after spending all of our hotel time in very close quarters, the garden terrace offered us a great retreat and space that we so desparately needed. Carmel and Pino were so nice and treated us just like family. Pino tried to teach our youngest how to speak Italian which was really fun. And Carmel shared many stories and gave us great advice. We would go back there in a heart-beat.

<Content>Enjoyable stay! I stayed in the single room at the top of the stairs, which was perfect to suit my needs. The premises were very clean and home-like. Yes, once or twice I noticed the street noise, but I was so tired from trekking around beautiful Florence that it really didn't bother me! Il Bargellino is only a few blocks from the fruit market, and so I made very good use of the in-room refrigerator (a real plus!!!). There was a booklet in the room with recommendations, which I found very helpful too. Also, I really enjoyed the outside terrace, where I met other guests and was invited to share an evening with Carmel and Pino and guests. Carmel and Pino were both very nice and generous hosts. I recommend Il Bargellino, and would stay there again when I return to Florence!

<Content>Perfect. We stayed two nights at the Il Bargellino on a 23 night trip through 5 countries in Europe, and it was one of if not the best place we stayed. We found it after a short walk from the train station, and received a warm welcome from Pino. Our room was lovely --- clean, cozy, with great antique furniture and a small but completely adequate bathroom. Our windows/doors opened onto a great terrace. If we had stayed longer, I am sure we would have eaten a few picnic meals out there. One of the nicest things about the Il Bargellino was the little booklet left in our room that gave all sorts of great information, from where the nearest phone and internet points were to DELICIOUS restaurant recommendations to dead-on directions for sightseeing. I would come back here in a heartbeat, and recommend it to anyone.

On the terrace, the city dissapears as you admire the lemon trees and listen to the birds.The room and bathroom were very clean, Pino (the owner) was friendly and helpful. From the train station, take what Carmel calls the more complex but much shorter way if you are hauling luggage. It's not only shorter, it's not congested with cars and people.

<Content>Strongly recommend this hotel!! We spent two nights at Il Bargellino in May 2007 and had a great time! The owners, Pino and Carmel, provided a warm welcome and treated us like family. Carmel is originally from Boston, and speaks fluent English, which was convenient for helping us find major sites and directions. She also made museum reservations for us and suggested wine tours, which both turned out to be highlights of our trip.We spent our evenings on the roof top terrace eating and drinking with other hotel guests. We met wonderful people and really felt like we got to experience a taste of the real Florence. The hotel was located in a central location, within walking distance of restaurants and the major sites. Florence was one of three stops in Italy and by far our favorite!!The rooms were a good size in comparison to the other locations in Italy and we had private bathrooms in our rooms. Our rooms were decorated in an eclectic decor which seemed to accent the overall feel of the hotel. If you are looking for Ritz Carlton luxury, this may not be the place for you (try Barcelona), however if you are looking for moderately priced, comfortable room, in the heart of Florence, with the feel of home.. this is definitely the right place!! -Christina and Jessica

<Content>Bad experience After reading reviews decided to stay here on my birthday to have a relaxing fun time. Bad choice. I think the room we stayed in was #6. Sewer gas in bathroom was so bad that it also entered the bedroom area. We complained to both owners and they blamed the smell on the family who had stayed there the previous night with a small child. I know the smell of sewer gas and its caused by bad plumbing not from previous night guests. Owners didn't express any desire to help us other than opening a window which allowed a lot of street noise into the room. We were unable to sleep and felt very disappointed and cheated. Now we know why she wanted to be paid in advance and not accept a credit card to reserve the room. We would not recommend this place to anyone, as it was one of the worst experiences we have ever had in our traveling. We would have been better off if we had slept in the train station.

<Content>Our Home in Florence This hotel feels much more like a home than an institution--for us, that feeling came from the moment we met Carmel, who grew up in Boston, and she invited us upstairs onto her lovely outside terrace. Located near enough to the train station to be convenient for travel but on a side street, Hotel Il Bargellino is also near to several Florentine sights. Our only complaint was that the noice from the street can be a little annoying late at night, but it's a trade-off for being right in close proximity to so much. Carmel enticed us as customers by helping us find the best accomodations in her hotel, and we will stay here again upon our next trip to Florence.

<Content>Canaries and Lemons and the Duomo We arrived on a rainy Monday and were greeted so warmly! Our room at Il Bargellino was impeccably clean and graciously decorated. The refrigerator was a great help, and the patio was luxurious! I spent two hours with my watercolors looking at the lemon tree and the terracotta sculpture with Il Duomo in the distance. It's close to everything and yet tucked away in a real neighborhood. We awoke to the ringing of the church bells and relaxed to the contented trills of Carmel's and Pino's darling canary! La dolce vita to be sure! J. Anderson and K. Douthit

Carmel and Pino are fabulous it felt like we were staying with family. Carmel was full of information on the sights of Firenze as well as assisting with our day trips to Lucca, Assisi and Rome. Her suggestions for restaurants were excellent and she requested feedback to ensure that we were satisfied with her suggestions.

<Content>The Absolute Best! Several of us chose to visit Florence for six nights and we decided all of us would stay at Hotel Il Bargellino--I am so in love with this place!! Carmel and Pino, the proprietors, have a way of making you feel at home. Carmel made reservations for us at museums prior to our visit and was always prepared with directions and suggestions for restaurants and shops. The hotel is 2 blocks from the train station which made it super easy for excursions. The hotel itself is extremely clean and comfortable and decorated with cool antiques and art. Evenings on the terrace under the stars created such incredible conversations. To top it off--the prices are so reasonable! I will never stay anywhere else when I visit Florence and highly recommend this hotel. Get a group together and rent all 10 rooms!!!

<Content>Beautiful Florence We stayed 4 nights at Hotel Il Bargellino in early May 2007 after a reading a good review in EyeWitness Travel- Italy. Coming from Australia we were not sure what to expect but we were delighted with our choice. The small, family run hotel was located close to the train station and was within walking distance of all the museums, artgalleries etc. We loved the European ambience of our spacious room with the shuttered window overlooking the cobbled steet. Carmel,the hostess, was very helpful with local information and also assisted us with bookings for our next destination. We found it very useful that she was bi-lingual as we were not! Hotel Il Bargellino isexcellent value for money.

The owners, Carmel and Pino, are very welcoming and are willing to do anything to make their guests comfortable. Do remember their kindness in making museum reservations and the invitations to join them on the terrace! The terrace is a great place to get to know them, meet other guests, talk about different traveling finds, and simply to take part in this beautiful part of Italian culture. I recommend it to all - the kind management, quiant and comfortable rooms, the clean bathrooms, beautiful art and sculpture hallways, and inviting terrace - give it a try!

<Content>A Super Place to Stay I really enjoyed my stay at Il Bargellino in Firenze. It is located within walking distance of all the sights in the city. I was in the single room, which was comfortable, and not far from the bathroom. The open air terrace was a wonderful place to relax after a day of museums and shopping, perfect for a glass of wine before going out for a delicious meal in the evening. I would have loved to have had coffee available in the morning, but there was a cafe a few blocks away for my morning pick-me-up. Carmel assisted with museum reservations, and with tips on how to get around in the city and the countryside. I will definitely return to Il Bargellino on my next visit to Firenze.

<Content>Great Place to Stay We stayed three nights in late March 2007 at the Il Bargellino. The location was handy to everything we wanted to see and we were able to walk to all the interesting sights. (The walk to Michelangelo Plaza is the longest hike we took and I recommend it for early inthe day when you are fresh). The hosts were helpful and friendly and the informal family atmosphere seemed to rub off on the other guests who were open and shared experiences and information.In spite of its central location we were not bothered by street noise and in addition to sleeping well at night we could relax comfortably on the second floor patio. A great place for a glass of wine in the afternoon after sight-seeing.

<Content>A great sleep in Florence My daughter and I stayed two nights at IL Bargellino in a twin room with tall french doors opening onto IL Bargellino's expansive and relaxing second story garden patio (there was also a regular door that opened into the hall). Our room was very quiet, comfortable and clean with way cool (as my daughter says) high ceilings. The small private bathroom had nice fixtures and excellent plumbing. We slept superbly. IL Bargellino is within easy walking distance of the Florence train station and all of Florence's world-class attractions.Carmel and Pino (the owners) were very kind and helpful. Their advice and recommendations helped us to get more out of our short stay in Florence and save a few Euros in the process.

<Content>A Gem! This perfect little getaway starts with the warm reception of Carmel and Pino (Carmel is also extremely helpful in organizing your stay in Florence). This place is spectacular boasting a perfect location for the person who enjoys walking. Centrally located by the train station and within walking distance to a lot of the major attractions (make sure you get to the Uffizi). The accommodations are clean and well maintained with a beautiful sun deck off the back. Where if you are lucky, Pino will spend sometime and explain the culture of Florence while showing you his assortment of plants/trees (even lemon trees!). I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys staying in a comfortable place; where the owners due there best to make you feel like you have been friends for years! It is the kind of place you will always want to go back to!Cheers,Chris

<Content>Very Enjoyable Stay at Il Bargellino My sister stayed at Il Bargellino a few years ago and recommended it to us when we were planning our trip to Italy. Carmel was very helpful and responsive during the booking process andoffered help with making reservations at the museums.The location of the hotel was great, we didn't need any transportation from the train station because it was within a short walking distance and it was very close to everything else, including the market and the Duomo. The rooms were large and interestingly decorated. The bed was comfortable and the sounds from the street were not too loud. The shower in our room was tiny, really just a shower head separated from the toilet by a curtain, but I guess that's not unusual in Italy. The bathroom itself was clean, everything was in good working order, there was hot water and good water pressure. The were was no tv in the room itself, but that wasn't a problem for us as we spent most of our days walking outside.Carmel was friendly and we had a very enjoyable stay. Overall, it was a great choice for this price range.

Now this is not the Ritz by any means but for 75 euros a night, you just can't get a better bang for the buck. The room was spartan but comfortable, allowing us to sleep well. This is all we really needed since we were out from morning to night. The owner, Carmel is a real goldmine of information. She speaks English perfectly and was always spot on with her recommendations. All in all a great find and when next I'm in Firenze,I'll have no hesitation in staying there again.

<Content>Real Italian Experience I spent three nights at Il Bargellino at the end of February. A friend referred me to this hotel and it was exactly what they said it would be. The rooms are clean and the decor is charming, with an eclectic mix of antique furniture. The hotel was just minutes from the train station and a beautiful walk to the heart of the center, close to everything! The street is quiet and has a real neighborhood feel to it. I loved this! There's a large terrace (used by all the quests and the owners) and in my opinion, was the best part of Il Bargellino. I was able to relax with a bottle of wine and chat with other travelers, after a day of touring the city. The owners Carmel and Pino, were pleasant and always around to answer any questions, (and I had many). Carmel, is American, so there was no language barrier. She also booked all my museum reservations, which was a big help. They do not offer breakfast, but I found a great coffee bar at the end of the street. What I loved most, was the peaceful atmosphere at the hotel. There is a real Italian feel to it, which was exactly what I was looking for! I was also impressed with how quickly Carmel replied, when I email to check on availability. I have traveled all over Italy and found my experience in Florence at Il Bargellino, one of the best!

<Content>Can't wait to visit again!!! Loved it!!! My friend and I stayed at Il Bargellino March 2-6th and had a wonderful experience! I have stayed in other places in Florence and none compared to this hotel. First the hotel was as clean as I would keep my own home, which was a great feeling. The terrace was great it was a nice place to sit early in the morning or at night before bed. The location was ideal it was close to all the tourist hot spots but on a nice residential street that made us feel like we lived in Florence and weren't visitng. The owner PIno was very helpful and made us feel right at home from the moment we walked in.I was also a guest at the hotel for the nights anothe guest complained that the owners were being loud and had a party that lasted until the early morning. I couldn't disagree more with those comments. There was not a gathering that lasted into the early morning hours. There were people in the owners area having supper and enjoying family time, coming from an Italian family myself the family gathering reminded me of home and the time I spend with my family. I felt very comfortable because even though there was a slight language barrier I was still able to bond with them based on the importance of family. I can't wait to go back to Florence and stay at Il Bargellino!Thank you for a wonderful experience!!

<Content>Wow! What a GREAT place I haven't ever written a review from the Hotel Bargellino, but recommended the hotel to one of my friends and he said that he saw a bad review of this fantastic place. I have read the review and was quite surprised, and quite honestly, annoyed by these peoples comments. I have stayed at the Il Bargellino at least 6 times over the years. I always stayed for 2 weeks and have found Carmel and Pino the best and most gracious hosts! They are so helpful, and because they live there at the hotel, they work their rear ends off helping people at all hours. It is a great family-oriented hotel and the terrace is great! They are professional and will provide you with everything you need, when you need it. When I stay there, I always request a terrace room, and they always mention that sometimes, people will be out on the terrace talking or having a glass of wine or just hanging out and that it can be noisy. But nothing ever gets out of hand. I would take the noise (not that there was anything out of the ordinary) over staying in any other room. During the Spring months, I could open my doors to the terrace. It is like a paradise in the middle of Florence. Yes, they entertain, and the clients also entertain themselves on the terrace, but both Pino and Carmel are very careful to make sure that the volume goes down (music and voices) at at 10pm or 11pm. This is pretty much the norm. 10 is actually very early for Italy, as most people eat at 8 or 9pm. I have encountered clients who have said that they really need to have peace and quiet at an earlier hour for their children or because they need to leave the next morning at the crack of dawn, and Carmel and Pino make sure to keep things quiet.One of the comments in the reviewer's mail was that it wasn't a great location. There couldn't be a better location! Florence is a small city and this hotel is walking distance from the bus station, train station and the center of the city. It's actually less congested than most areas and there are wonderful restaurants within feet of the hotel.Florence is a town of motorino and any street side room can be noisy. The sound of these vehicles going by can't be avoided unless your staying at a huge hotel. I would much rather listen to the mixture of languages on the terrace.Carmel and Pino are great. The hotel is great. When I stay there, I have only heard the most positive comments about the atmosphere and the service. Everyone has their opinion, but every single guest at the hotel I have met has had rave reviews about the place. You must go and check it out and stay there..I will guarantee that you will more than happily surprised. I'll be there in July...I'm bringing my family for the 2nd time. Hope to see you there! You won't regret it.

<Content>Like one of the family I've stayed at Il Bargellino on many occasions and every time I go, I feel like I'm going to my second home. I found it when I was studying in Florence 7 years ago and I was looking for a place for my parents to stay. I wandered the small streets near my school and I chanced upon Il Bargellino. Pino was outside chatting with the neighbors and I asked for help and after a jumbled conversation with my patchy Italian, hand gestures and many laughs, Pino invited me in and helped me book a room. My parents had an excellent stay and it was great to make new friends in foreign city. Ever since then, Carmel and Pino are always overjoyed to have me, we sit on the terrace enjoying an amazing bottle of Italian wine, chatting about nothing and everything, and I feel completely at ease and relaxed in that oasis. I have tried my hand at other hotels in the city and have been bitterly disappointed. Hotels would fall short of their top notch service and quality claims. Give me Il Bargellino ANY DAY over those chain hotels. It is especially refreshing to be able to speak English with Carmel when the Italian proves too daunting but then when I feel a little more daring, I can practice my Italian with patient Pino. But best of all, after a long, sweaty, tiring day, I get back to Il Bargellino and there is dinner, wine, and good company waiting for me... and we always go to bed at a decent hour since we all have to wake up at the crack of dawn the next day. (and there is always siestas and espressos to help you along in the day!) I absolutely adore Florence but beware! it can be very daunting to the unprepared tourist. The sights are breathtaking, the people friendly, the gelatto delicious, the art inspiring... but remember, it is a CITY. A very beautiful, quaint city, but a city nonetheless. And as in all cities, you will have noise, traffic, fumes, pickpockets, lost tourists, long queues, pushy peddlers, late-night revelers, etc. This is not to deter you in the least, but I find Florence a lot easier to tackle with that in mind. The wonderful thing about Florence is that if the noise and confusion gets too much, you have only walk 15-25 minutes in any direction and I promise you it WILL get quieter. There are so many wonderful nooks and crannies to discover in Florence! Florence has been around for centuries and Florentines are very proud about the fact. They do everything to preserve their city's history and charm. So no, you will not find a 'modern' hotel with all the lastest gadgets, king size beds, or state-of-the-art AC blaster. The buildings came first, the hotels were then fit into the already existing building... not the other way around; as in, the building was not erected specifically to be a hotel that met our 20th century needs.  Oh! and also know that Italians are jolly, well-meaning folk who love to eat, drink, talk, laugh, and spend time in comunion with others. That's what going to Italy is all about... the monuments will always be there, you can come back to them, you can see them in pictures... what really matters are the people you meet, the conversations that you have, the chance encounters that will shape your experience in that city/country. Afterall, it's the people that make up a country, not bricks and mortar. So please do not turn down the opportunity to get a taste of what the culture is really about. All this to say, that I hold Florence very dear to my heart and mostly because of my times at Il Bargellino. Carmel and Pino are wonderful hosts, the hotel is clean, full of beautiful art, it runs smoothly, the terrace is perfect for kicking back and taking a break from the overwhelming sites, the rooms are a good size and the bathrooms are in great condition. I always look forward to my yearly trip to Florence and Il Bargellino. It truly has become a second home to me.

<Content>Loved this place Whoever wrote that poor review of this hotel must have taken grumpy pills. Our family of 5 booked two rooms at this hotel, it was perfect for us. There was a fridge in the room, so we could keep cold drinks and other snacks, (important, as we were traveleing with a 5 year old). Rooms were clean and very quaint. When we needed extra towels, there was no problem getting them. The owners were extremely helpful getting us tickets to the Uffizi gallery and other attractions, especially in helping us find kid friendly activities in Florence. ) The terrace is one of the things we loved best about that hotel, and we met people from all over the world there. It was lovely to sit on that terrace and sip wine and talk with other travelers. I would not hesitate recommending this hotel to anyone who is looking for a clean hotel with a friendly atmosphere.

<Content>Not at all what I expected at ALL Wow. What a disappointment. I was thouroughly looking forward to my stay at Il Bargellino, it came highly rated by Rick Steves and Carmel was nothing but wonderful during correspondence and helping with museum reservations. I was probably the most excited about this hotel over any other we were planning on staying in in Italy. The room was OK, i thought it was cute but my husband did not like it. Our room opened onto the Terrace, which Im sure is beautiful in the late Spring/Summer. Carmel was in Boston visiting family, and her husband Pino spoke little English, but was very kind. There was also another man there who was from Boston, and he was nice as well. The small issues were the supplies (only one towel in the bathroom, no bathmat, location was not ideal, blah blah). The huge issue was at night. For our two night stay, we honestly slept about 4 hours each night. This was due to parties being thrown in the common room (or owner's quarters) located immediately next to our room. I had requested a room away from the owners home, due to my readings of other complaints on trip advisor, but I was assured that this would not be a problem. Boy was I mislead. We stayed in Florence for a Sunday and Monday night, two nights not usually considered your party nights. Both nights, the owners and miscellaneous friends, other guests, and who knows who else, gathered and drank and ate and talked and talked and talked and as the hours wore on, their voices grew louder and louder and louder. It was way past the level even of complete rudeness. The first night, we tried for many many hours to go to sleep, and the party eventually died down around 12am. The second night, however, it was around 2 when my husband finally got out of bed, walked over, and asked them all to be quiet. The party settled down a little bit, but it was still some time before everyone packed up and went to bed. We at first felt rude ourselves even thinking to go ask the owners to quiet down, since they were in their own house persay. However we soon got over this and realized it is one thing to do as you wish since you own the place, but it is a completely different thing to carry on which such volume and complete disregard for the guests who are PAYING to stay at your hotel. The professionalism of this hotel is terribly lacking, and I have a feeling (or at least I am still trying to see some good in this hotel) that this would not have happened id Carmel was in town. My husband and I were not going to pay for our second night, and actually request we receive full refund since the entire point in us staying there (having somewhere to SLEEP) was negated completely, but upon leaving Pino was at the desk and we both didnt want to mess with trying to explain ourselves when there was a language barrier. I would not reccommend this place to anyone, and am again incredibly disappointed in Il Bargellino and their idea of quality service to their customers.

<Content>The comforts of Home I travelled to Italy alone. One of my stops was Florence. I felt very much at home when I stayed at Hotel II Bargellino. Truthfully, more than at home. I really appreciated the kindness that was shown to me by the owners. I also met others there who felt the same. I would love to return. And I am planning to stay again when I do. Sonya

<Content>Seven years of consistently great experiences... I've been staying at the Hotel Il Bargellino for years--the first time in 2000, and most recently just last year. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Florence--actually, it would break my heart!Carmel and Pino have always been magnificent hosts--friendly, approachable and helpful, even when they have their own stuff going on--even when recovering from a motorbike accident and fairly major surgery a couple of years ago, Carmel still did her best to keep everything running smoothly. She's always ready to make restaurant recommendations, museum reservations, or whatever , and Pino is always ready with a wave and a smile as he putters about the place, painting, fixing or polishing stuff to keep everything in good order.The hotel facilities may not be of the luxury standard that some of the reviewers on here seem to expect, but we have always been overjoyed with the quality and beauty of our rooms, as well as the excellent value for money. The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms in good working order (good water pressure!), and the furniture beautifully cared for. The lovely terrace itself is worth the stay--I'm actually still in touch with a number of fellow travelers I've met out on the terrace, striking up conversation over a glass of wine and a bowl of olives. The Hotel Il Bargellino might not be a cocoon of white linen, gold-plated faucets and soundproof windows--if you want that, PLEASE stay at a faceless luxury chain and leave this place available for the rest of us--but it IS a friendly, clean, helpful and very beautiful establishment. You can be at the market (walking) within five minutes, and at the Duomo within six or seven. The only time I've ever felt the need to use anything other than my feet to get somewhere is when my destination is waaaaay across the river and uphill, and even then I usually walk one way and bus back! Oh--and it's also family friendly--my daughter has loved the place since she was just three years old, and she is especially attached to the bowl of candy that Pino keeps well stocked in the upstairs hallway.Anyway, if you're looking for a hotel that is homey rather than fancy, but still very clean and well equipped, this would be the place. Sit out on the terrace and have a drink for me...

<Content>Very nice Being my first trip to Italy, I relied on the Internet for all my research. I was so nervous on the taxi ride from the train station - not at all sure what we were headed for! When we arrived, I was so pleased with this hotel! Carmel had just had surgery and was moving slowly, but she greeted us warmly, gave us the room key, and got us started on our exploration of Florence. I felt like this hotel was exactly what I wanted in my experience of Florence. A city environment, but not right on top of all the people. I was traveling with my 2 older teenage daughters, and we felt 100% safe in the neighborhood. We were out every night walking and eating and exploring. We walked everywhere - even though it was SO darned hot during our visit.The terrace was very nice in the evenings (we also met the neighbors cat), when the rooms were sweltering. I do have to say that next time (and there will be a next time), I would prefer a room on the terrace side, not the street side. Since it was so hot, you had no choice but to leave the windows opened. The noise from the street can be incredibly frustrating when you are hot and having difficulty sleeping anyway, and people are out very late, talking/laughing as they wander down the street, and motor scooters flying down the street at all hours. Carmel and Pino have a very nice book in the rooms, telling you everything you need to know about services in the area (where the best laundromat is, where the best local breakfast is, where the Mailboxes, etc. is). You find out about how she met Pino and came to live in Florence. It is all very quaint and so easy to be there. It isn't the Holiday Inn.......BUT, who wants that? You can stay at a big hotel chain anytime. Why not stay somewhere that you can actually talk to locals and get to know them?

<Content>Noisy, but cute We stayed here one night and then headed somewhere more quiet after getting up in the middle of the night to put earplugs in so that we could sleep. The hotel is cute and charming and the owners are nice and welcoming. The rooms are spacious and clean, although they could use some updating. There was no air conditioning in our room so we had to leave the windows open and the vespa and chatter noise from the street below was intolerable. Nice and spacious patio, but don't expect to be able to use it for your private use.

<Content>Perfect location The Il Bargellino is nicely located not far from the Duomo and is in a safe location not far from the train station. Rooms are good, ask for the pink bedroom because it's the largest and the nicest! The host, a former Boston guy, is friendly and provides good insights into what to do in Florence. No breakfast, but for the money, this is worth it if your on a budget.

<Content>A very special hotel You are going to love this hotel. But you have to keep an open mind and know that it is not one of those hotels where you never see the other guests. It is a small hotel filled with charm and does not have the generic hotel furniture and makes you feel like you are visiting someone's home. It is conveniently located near the train station and because Florence is so small, there is no problem walking to the attractions, many of which are within a 15 minute walk. There are also many dining options.My room was a single facing the street. Though it did not face a main street, there was some noise, especially from the Vespas, but that is a small price to pay for the value of staying here. The rooftop terrace was the highlight of my trip. After running around, I would end my day by dining on my takeout on the rooftop. I would also read and often other guests would come out and we would chat. It was a great time to share travel tips. Carmel, one of the owners was so nice and enjoyable to talk with. One night a group of us sat around drinking wine and eating treats with the Carmel. I've traveled extensively in Europe and this is now my favorite hotel. You should book ASAP as they are being featured in a popular guide book and I know they will be in high demand!!

<Content>I Second the "Different Opinion" My husband and I spent 1 night (out of the original 3 we reserved) and absolutely hated it. We were put in the room next to the family residence and could hear our host's telephone conversations, the very loud television with someone watching cartoons, the bathroom was horrible....looked like it was taken out of a ship. When we walked out of our room we could see directly into the family's kitchen, which was not Nonna's cucina....there should have been some closed off portion for the family. Also, the terrace that everyone was talking about was lined with the family's laundry drying....not my idea of quaint or charming. The one redeeming thing I can say is that we were given a refund for the nights that we decided not to stay (we paid in full at time of booking). We went out that evening in search of a new hotel and luckily found one not too far away.

<Content>Like staying at your Italian Nonna's House... My husband and I stayed at Il Bargellino for 8 nights at the beginning of October. The rooms are funky and fun, decorated with random art and antiques. Our room faced the terrace, and had a high ceiling and cool marble floor. The large bed was very comfortable and the room clean. The terrace is a definite bonus. Carmel keeps a small cage of canaries on the patio, and it's pleasing to hear them singing in the morning and afternoon. In the evening you can relax and watch the bats swoop around the sky, chirping and catching bugs. We had the added bonus of making friends with the neighbor's cat, who came around every morning after the 7am bells. Carmel and Pino are very friendly and accomodating; they want to make sure you are having a good time and had suggestions regarding restaurants, etc. While another reviewer wrote that the hotel is out of the center of town, it's not THAT far out, and actually it is a lot quieter on that street than others in Florence. Street noise at night was not an issue. I would recommend this location for people who don't mind walking a little. I found it nice to get out of the downtown madness and return to our quiet street. The neighborhood has several good not-touristy restaurants (including the one we decided to have our wedding reception at), a self-service laundry, an internet point, and there is a friendly bar on the corner perfect for a nightcap. The only complaint I might have is that our room was too warm until late into the night when the evening cooled down. We usually slept with only our shutters closed. Still, I found it good value for the money. We spent a very restful week here, and I would recommend it to the traveler who is looking for a less typical experience than just another hotel.
