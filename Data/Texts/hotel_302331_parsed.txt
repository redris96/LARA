<Content>positive Stayed here over the Xmas new year period 08/09 with two adult children. very good choice for us. Centrally located with MTR across the street, local supermarket nearby and bus and tram stop close.rooms very clean and housekeeping very helpful at any hour. Front office and other staff happy to oblige. only down side was the breakfast buffet, never seemed to get it right each time but they tried. Would suggest breakfasting elsewhre many local cafes available or jump on MTR to Causeway Bay, beauty salon expensive , better off heading into Causeway Bay but for convenience sake we tried and couldn't fault the service. several eating options available and happy hour after 5. reasonable rates.

<Content>Cheap  A good  cheap transportation via TVR to this Hotel but it is a long way from Central. Great rate but the bed was so hard we could not sleep in it for the first night and I was glad we only stayed two nights in it( I got extra towels in to sleep on to help soften the mattress) because there was no extra bedding we could use supplied in the room and we were quite cold on the first night. For the price we paid the Hotels facilities were very adequate though.

<Content>Good hotel, good location We really liked the location of the Harbour Plaza - it is not in the middle of the tourist areas of HK and gives you a better chance to see the real HK. The MTR and the Tram stops are close to the hotel and they take you everywhere. North Point with its wonderful wet market is 5 min by Tram and Causeway Bay and Central are only 10-15 Min away.We had a room with a partial harbour view. The room was spacious and clean - housekeeping did a good job.The pool was one of the largest I have ever seen in a city hotel - not many guests were using it, so I had it mostly on my own.The supermarket opposite of the hotel is open until 11 pm - no need to pay for the expensive mini bar items.I would love to stay at this hotel again on our next trip to HK.

<Content>Absolutely fine We have just returned from 11 nights in Hong Kong - 8 of those staying at the Harbour Plaza North Point. After changing rooms because we initially had a smoking room we found the new room to perfectly suit our needs. Our two girls (aged 9 and 7) slept on the sofa bed in the living room whilst my husband and I had a separate bedroom - with its own TV. The room had a separate little kitchen although strangely no utensils as we were not long term tenants.There is a supermarket across the road so you don't need to eat in restaurants all the time if you don't want to. The pool was fantastic - it is not often you see a 25m pool in a hotel and the gym was well equipped. The hotel provides regular free shuttle buses to the local shopping malls and the MTR train station is about 100m from the hotel entrance. Yes, I agree with other reviews that it is a little way out but with the MTR being so efficient it doesn't really matter. HK Island is definitely better to stay on than Kowloon. The staff were friendly although they needed a better area displaying local tourist attractions as the concierges were a little limited in their English to fully answer our questions. Overall and good hotel providing value for money.

Could not fault anything about the Harbour Plaza North Point.Room was spacious  clean, had a partial harbour view which was great even on the 10th floor. All staff were very friendly and went out of their way with service or help.Travelled everywhere on MTR , which is just across the road from the hotel.

<Content>Problem rooms? Harbour Plaza North Point is a perfectly good 3 star hotel. However, I'm downgrading it in my review because I was initially allocated a room which was obviously damp and musty. When I complained I was allocated another room - exactly the same but dry.I've no idea whether this is an isolated incident for this hotel, but it impacts on my ability to recommend this hotel, as had occupancy been higher I may have been stuck with an unacceptable room.The facilities and common areas were of the standard you would expect from a hotel in this class.

<Content>Great value hotel I stayed at this hotel for 14 days while visting family in Hong Kong, and i thought the hotel was fantastic. My parents and i had a family suite which had partial views of the harbour, the room was a great size with a small kitchen, dinning table, TV, shower room, double bedroom and a single bed in the living room. Even although we had a single bed and a sofa bed in the living room there was still plently of space.The towels in the room got changed everyday and our maid was a great help, even although she couldn't speak any English she still managed to fix any problems(shower got blocked on first day) we had quickly.There is nothing much around the hotel as it seems to be more a residential area, however there is a great supermarket just across the road and also a McDonalds and Pizza Hut nearby for convenience. It is extremely easy to get around the city, taxis are VERY cheap and are readly available outside the hotel. The Quarry Bay MTR station is across the road from the hotel and again is a very quick, easy and cheap way to travel around the city (around 30p for 5 stops).Recommended sites: PoLin Monestry and Budda (get MTR to Tung Chung and then cable car to the village)Tram upto peak where there is great views over the harbour, go at night to see the building lights being switched on.Hong Kong disneyland, altough not as good or as big as the Orlando one it is still a great day out. Only around 拢2.50 to travel on MTR from hotel to the resort!!!Visit Happey Valley Racecourse. The racing season was finished when we visited but iv been told it is a great night out.Visit Macau and the fantastic Venetian Macau hotel.Visit Lan Kwai Fong, where there are many great restaurants and bars.I had a great time in Hong Kong and will definetely visit again and i will stay at this hotel again too.

<Content>Great value This is a very pleasant hotel with great harbour views from many rooms. We were very lucky to be upgraded to a suite room on the top floor, which was very nice!There's nothing much in the local vicinity of the hotel, but it is right near the Quarry Bay MTR so getting in and out is pretty convenient.

<Content>good well priced hotel IF you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel then I would recommend this hotel I stayed there for two nights the rooms are large the bed is a bit hard but otherwise the room is bright and modern . The hotel caterers for mainly tour groups so the lobby can be a bit congested at times . It has easy access to the underground system I paid 850 hk per night which I consider very reasonable for HK

<Content>OK but not recommended Let's just say that it is clean hotel. Close to MTR (subway), supermarket Wellcome, Mc Donalds, that's all.Location wise, not very convenient, the closest mall would be Tai Koo by tram, and to go to Causeway Bay would be pretty far by HK standard.The reason I stayed here because all the other hotels were fully booked at the time within my price range. So would I recommend it, well only if you can't find other hotels in the last minute for the Hong Kong side hotels. I guess more hotels in Kowloon side. As what other contributor said, yes it is located beside a funeral house, unless you are superstitious then better don't stay here but luckily I'm not, and the hotel is quite full of guests by the way.

<Content>Very Good I had a good deal in this hotel through Expedia. It was all worth it,great room space in HK standards, very clean, healpfull and generous staff. Simply, it's all what you can ask for.Like any other thing in life, it's not perfect. The only drawback i can find on this hotel is its location. It's quite far from city center and from where all the fun is.( which means gonna make you pay extra for transportaion within HK), although it is less than a minute walk to the MTR station.

<Content>Solid, but unspectacular I stayed here for a week on business in April 2008 and found the hotel to be a decent hotel in a pretty convenient location in HK. It's certainly not in the thick of Central or Kowloon, but a short subway ride from anywhere. We chose this because it was close to our meetings--otherwise you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms are pretty small, but clean and well-kept. However, the beds are as hard as nails...ouch. Also, there's no wireless internet. The gym is decent, but light on weights. The hotel has a nice breakfast buffet, but the food in the restaurant overall is quite average.

<Content>Above average stay We stayed at the Harbour Plaza North Point for one night at the beginning of April 08.The check in staff weren't particularly friendly nor welcoming however the concierge was very helpful in recommending things to do, places to see and places to eat. The room we got was nice and clean, it had a big shower and all the toiletries and amenities you could expect from a 4 star hotel, including toothbrushes and toothpaste. Bed was hard, but I understand that's the norm in asia which we were able to confirm throughout our 2 week trip around chinaOur room had a small kitchenette and there was a bowl of fruit waiting for us upon arrival. It is true that there is nothing interesting close to the hotel, however the hotel is less than 100 mts away from an MTR station, and it'll take only about 10 minutes to get to Central by MTR. The tram also stops just in front of the hotel so transport links are very convenient. There is a Seven eleven and a number of smaller shops to the left of the hotel past the funeral house and right opposite to the hotel you'll find a small supermarket and a Cafe de Coral restaurant which serves nice chinese food and seems to be quite popular as you'll find it all over HK including Terminal 1 at the airport.Overall this hotel was nice. It was nothing particularly special but for the price you do get good quality accommodation and ok service.

<Content>Location poor I wouldn't stay at this hotel simply because of its location.It is just besides the famous Hong Kong Funeral parlor鈥? For all those who never been to Hong Kong, it's fine. For those who are in Hong Kong for a long time, we all know what that location means. No matter how good it is or how cheap it is. I wouldn't stay there.I believe you don't want to see all types of funeral during your trip.

<Content>Clean room and efficient service My first impression was that the lobby staff were highly efficient and professional. Btw this is Hong Kong so don't expect the same warmth and friendliness that you normally get in other Asian cities like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta or Bangkok. But I wouldn't rate them badly for this coldness as efficiency can be a very welcome trait for a harried traveler. Just manage your expectations to suit their local culture and you'll be fine.A warning though, there is no free breakfast offered. There is a breakfast buffett but this will cost you. I've never stayed in a hotel where there's no free breakfast service before so I felt I was being ripped off. They also took their time with my luggage. I was wanting to carry up my suitcase myself but they *insisted* on taking it. So fine. It was close to midnight and I was tired so I let them, not expecting it to be a problem. All I wanted to do was shower, change and sleep. But because they took my luggage, I ended up sitting in my room with the same clothes on as I was wearing on the flight for 20 minutes before they finally delivered my suitcase. I don't get the logic of this. If this happens to you, insist to carry your own luggage up! There's lifts to every floor so there's no problem at all logistically. At first I thought this was the way for them to squeeze a tip from the guest. So I had my money out when the knock came but the guy who brought it in turned tail out the door without even pausing. So its not the tip then? *scratches head*Apart from this minor annoyance, my stay was good in overall. The good: The room was clean and neat. Good sized bathroom. Comfortable beds. Cable television. A view of the harbour. Effficient and professional staff. In the room, there is an electric kettle to boil water with. The bad: No free wifi. No free breakfast. Strange insistence to take my bags when I checked in was a waste of my time.

<Content>decent hotel but far from anything I went to Hong Kong as part of a study abroad program. I would not have chosen this hotel if I was making the arrangements because of the location. I prefer a hotel in a more central location so that I can walk to restaurants, bars and shops. The hotel itself is clean and decent looking. The breakfast is good and has plenty of options. The rooms are clean, the beds are twin size and a little hard but plenty of pillows. There is internet access but you have to ask for the wire. The metro is a half a block away and is safe to use. The taxis are very reasonable to get around. We used the conference room there and it was a good size, clean and they had tea, coffee, and things to nosh on. I hope this helps

<Content>Great value for a Hong Kong Island Hotel This was my second stay here and I find it good value for money in a conveneient location.The Harbour Plaza is 6 km from Central but is ideally located for public transport with the tram right outside the door and the MTR just a block away. They also have a free bus to Central every hour. But because it is away from the Central, the prices are much lower than an equivalent hotel located in Central.Staying on the Island is much quieter than in Kowloon and as half the attractions are on the Island I think it is the better place to stay.The breakfasts are great but expensive if not included in the tariff. In fact everything is expensive if not included. Be sure to look for an offer that includes breakfast. Avoid the minibar - even the local water is $US5 a bottle - most hotels provide complimentary local water.The rooms are small but well equipped with a view (glimpse) of the harbour.

<Content>Consistently good. We paid around AUD$130 per night for this hotel in a superior harbour view room, and it proved to be excellent value. Some people may be a little put off by its location, which is about 10-15mins away on the MTR from central Hong Kong. I wouldn鈥檛 worry too much about it 鈥?the MTR is one of the world鈥檚 best public transport systems 鈥?easy to use, cheap, reliable and efficient. Getting into town wasn鈥檛 too much of a hassle at all.The rooms are a little small, but not too bad by Hong Kong standards - especially for the price. The room was spotless, the bathroom was a good size, and quality fittings were used. There was enough storage space in the room for 2 people to completely unpack their luggage for 5 days. The staff members were consistently good 鈥?everyone we encountered (barring one ill-mannered waiter in the restaurant) was professional, friendly and courteous. Sometimes they were a little too business-like, but I didn鈥檛 mind that too much. You really got the impression that they were on top of everything at this well run, efficient establishment. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel restaurant (called Greens) and while the d茅cor of the restaurant was a little lackluster, the food was good, and offered pretty good value. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for great value accommodation in Hong Kong.

<Content>Rude booking staff. Hotel next to Hong Kong Funeral Home I called the hotel on 29th Oct to book a serviced apartment for my trip in Nov. The staff, Yvonne Lee promised to send me an email. I never receive it. The following day, I called the room reservation as I found out there was long stay promotion which suited me as I only stay for 3 weeks. I called IDD from Singapore. The reservation staff, Annie put me on hold for 3 times and each time for minutes. Finally, another staff, Cherry answered the phone. I told her I never receive any email information and about Annie. Cherry promised to email me information on long stay price. Guess what? Never email me!By the way, Harbour Plaza North Point is next to Hong Kong Funeral Home. Good for Halloween celebration!I finally booked with Kornhill Apartments which is near Taikooshing. The staff is very polite and helpful and booking process is easy.why pay more and suffer when you can pay less and enjoy? Don't go to Harbour Plaza and sleep with ghosts.

<Content>Go somewhere else! I made my booking at this hotel directly from the hotel website. I had opted for a harbor view room but I was given a room that they refer to as hill facing. I called up, visited the reservation desk regarding this but to no avail. Finally, they changed my room some 10 hours after my arrival after I had expressed enough displeasure about all this. Below are a few things that I would like to share:* The rooms were tiny with barely any space to even walk.* The shower cabinet was so small that you would invariably bump yourself against the walls no matter how straight you stand while taking a shower.* I have never experienced so much noise inside a hotel room. Even with the television on inside the room, the sound of people walking in the aisle could be heard loud enough inside the room. Moreover, noise from adjacent floors was also fairly apparent.* Even though the hotel is close to MTR Quarry Bay Station, there no markets nearby that you can walk up to.* Requests for wake up calls are ignored.My suggestion would be to opt for some other hotel. This one is horribly expensive if you look at the pain points (even otherwise it is very expensive).

<Content>Great Value Excellent value for money and a good general experience. If you want a good hotel at the right price then this is for you. If you want 5* luxury then go to the Peninsula. The breakfast was excellent and the rooms comfortable. Service was good and room service very quick. All our requirements were dealt with quickly including special diets and a late arrival and departure. No problems at all for us. Shop around for the best price we did and got a deal for a free breakfast.

<Content>Loved the Place I wanted a one-bedroom suite at a good price and great quality and I found it at Harbour Plaza Noth Point. It is a 3.5 to 4.0 star quality (closer to a 4 star). I sense that the staff was constantly trying to do things to make the hotel 4start+. The one-bedroom suite is very large for Hong Kong and comfortably sleeps 2 adults and 2 kids. The sofa in the living room is a fold-open bed for the 2 kids. They did NOT charge us extra for that. there is also a small dinner area with dinning table and a small kitchen with microwave and stove and fridge BUT no silverware NOR plates. The staff is CONSTANTLY cleaning and wiping the lobby coffee tables as soon as the guest leaves. The staff are extremely friendly. To maintain quality look to the hotel the manager discreetly and politely suggested to me to upgrade my sloppy attire in the lobby area (since I spent plenty of mornings in the lobby using my notebook). My one bedroom suite is very large and it has a spectacular view of the the ocean and Kowloon. The pool is well maintained, large, and pleasant. The hotel is NOT in the busy tourist Causeway Bay area but it is very close to the MTR (subway station) and trolley station. I eat at the Cafe De Corale fast food chain that is within walking distance from the hotel (almost across the street) every morning for breakfast. Excellent western and eastern breakfast for about $2.25US. I did a lot of web-based and travel agency research before I went to Hong Kong and this hotel's one-bedroom suite is best priced and I was definitely VERY pleasantly surprised.

<Content>Just the right spot Yesterday we returned from Hong Kong. Now we can't wait to go back there. It took until the final day when we realised just what a good position the hotel is in, after shopping in Admiralty area we tried to get onto the MTR, whilst the Chinese were trying to go home (Friday feeling!), they were climbing up our backs, so I had to yell that there was a child below who was getting squashed!!! Yes the HPNP, may be a little out of the way, but this means you will get a seat on the MTR. Also being away from Admiralty means that the shop prices are cheaper, Ad is full of Daks, Prada, Armarni etc...The hotel was fabulous, the staff (mostly) were warm and friendly, and very patient... well we did have Sam with us, eight years old and with a Chinese game for his DS... the guest relations were particularly kind. Greens the restaurant for breakfast most days and we used them for dinner, every other evening. The prices were not bad, and the food was delicious. We did not try the Hoi Yat Feen as we had taken a wrong turn out of the pool and the staff were quick to pounce... put us off a little.MTR opposite, over the crossing, as is Wellcome a mini-mart. It is amazing how clean Hong Kong is, even through the Typhoon, efficiency is number one. Stores have many staff to help you, and it is actually hard to spend your money. DisneyLand is terrific, and you can get a meal for three for about 拢8 English! DLand is very small, and before 11am is empty, then they arrive and the place is heaving. Buy your ponchos at the gate, three for about 拢6. Tshirts are less that a tenner, but be warned, the sizes are Asian, ie, a man who is normally a medium becomes XL, not good for the mind, and the Hard Rock Cafe is even tighter! On this aspect Florida is better if you are heavier as then you look sylph-like next to the Yanks, but an effalump next to the petite Chinese.The worst part of our holiday was that the old men walk around with their shirts up around their chest, showing off their tummies, no-one was seen to 'hockle' in thei streets, but go to the toilets and you hear it all come up, especially in the Ladies.No, seriously the worst part was coming home... we had travelled with Oasis HongKong and the flight over from Gatwick was fabulous. Returning to UK, there was no meal but a bag of crisps for my son... and we had paid extra! Then the flight was sent to Stansted because of fog, yet no other flights were... then we sat on the ground for three hours to find out we were not going to Gatwick after all, then... we had to wait another hour for bags to be unloaded, then another half an hour to find a coach to get us to Gatwick, then a two hour journey. The upshot was we got to Gatwick with a 7 1/2 hour delay... and no refreshments were offered either. This totally put the holiday into the black with memories. We were not amused and now waiting to find out what Oasis are going to do about it. PLUS... the dog has had to stay in the kennels another night, AND the house key was missing from the car after we left it at the airport and hubby has had to break in!Overall we would love to go back to Hong Kong, and we would definitely stay at Harbour Plaza North Point, no closer as there is the overcrowding risk! BUT we would travel with another operator.Hope you enjoy reading this review, but promise me you will visit the Peak (great Bubba Gump), Buddha on Lantau, worth the stressful stairs!, Outback restaurants, especially Nathan Rd, Hard Rock, Canton Rd (behind Nathan), visit the Jade market, and pay no more than a third of their required price, walk away, they will run after you!!! Go for the bargains, and visit Roger the tailor on Nathan Rd (Manhattan Tailor), for excellent service, even if you don't buy he will give you a free can of cold pop! The Peak is fantastic, we spent more than four hours up there. The trams are nowt to write about, and the Chinese don't like tattoos so there is more reason to have a seat on the MTR, they will avoid you. They love small blonde haired, blue eyed boys and my son still has the bruises on his cheeks to prove it, he is so embarrassed. Addition: you must visit Ocean Park, but take your Disney poncho, and queue up to see the pandas first, leave the rides till last, and go on the hot air balloon second.

<Content>Great Value - Highly Recommended A great 8 day stay.Booked our stay direct on the hotels website.Got a fantastic deal staying in a 'Harbour Club' junior suite. Plenty of space in the room including fridge, microwave and cooking facilities.Rooms were very clean and well looked after by the friendly staff.Our deal included Broadband internet access (but remember your lap-top !), Complimentary mini-bar, 1 x Buffet Bkfst per day, Complimentary happy hour in hotel bar plus extras.I am astonished by the previous negative comments on this hotel, I can only assume these are from people who stayed in the cheaper rooms? (you get what you pay for)Compared to european hotel deals, this was very competitive.The hotel is located by the nearby Quarry Bay MTR station, approx 10 minutes from the busy area's of Causeway Bay  WanChai. The hotel also provides complimentary shuttle buses to both area's.Also nearby are a handy Supermarket, Cafe Coral (traditional HK cuisine), McDonalds, Pizza-Hut and then there's the very Impressive CitiPlaza Shopping Centre at Taikoo is just 5 minutes away by taxi.

<Content>Bad experience This hotel reckon that it have a 4 star rating, but in my opinion a 3 star rating would be generous.From the tiny room size to the indifferent services from the staff, to the really horrible experience such as blocked toilet, Shower head that wont stay up (even after I notify the service dept they did not do anything).They also tried to charge me for item from mini bar that I don't even touch. Strewth!! what nerve this people have!! Beware, you will get charged for a full day internet even if you just plug in the line and not do any internet activity. They said they charge 140 HKD for 24 hrs use or 4hkd /minute, but you will get charged a full day rate anyway. I think you will be best to try other place and save yourself troubles I experienced.Shame on you Harbor Plaza North Point !! Here is an unhappy customer that do talk to other.

<Content>Great location for exploring Hong Kong Island My sister and I were staying for 14 nights in a one-bedroom suite. We have stayed in 3-4 stars hotels in Hong Kong previously, but we were very pleased with HPNP because of the good airconditioning, shower with lots of running water, kitchenette with microwave and fridge, harbour view, good lighting in the rooms and the convient location of the hotel. The Quarry Bay MTR station, the tram station and the A12 Cityflyer to and from the airport are within short walking distance. Equipped with an Octopus card, we could easily get around Hong Kong with the buses, trams and MTR. We were pleased with the hotel staff, and the door attendants and housekeeping were all polite and helpful. Staying here gives you the opportunity to explore parts of Hong Kong Island east of Causeway Bay. In Hong Kong the least of your problems is to find places to eat, but we enjoyed our take-aways in the dining room, in peace and quiet, after a long day of shopping! You can buy breakfast, lunch and dinner in Cafe de Coral or water, bread and juice in Wellcome across from the hotel. We will definately stay here again for our next Hong Kong getaway!

We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was fantastic.The one bedroom suite is fabulous and great for the money.Its only a couple of minutes' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station, there is a local supermarket directly opposite which is great.The staff were always helpful, plus on the day we were leaving they let us have our room for half a day extra at no charge.We enjoyed our stay at and will go there again 100% for sure!

<Content>Gobsmacked After a 14 hour flight and a short taxi ride we ended at the Harbour Plaza. Unfortunately our travel agent didn't realise there is more than one Harbour Plaza hotel in Hong Kong. We were booked in at the North Point - which after seeing the grandeur of the Flag Ship Harbour Plaza was a bit of a disappointment. That said it was fine for what it wasWe could sleep 2 adults and 2 kids to a room - so that was good and saved a bit of money as rooms are so expensive in HK.The buffet was good but expensive.The Porters were helpful and public transport was fun to navigate.Shops, Shops and more shopsOne of the things we wanted was a pool. The outdoor pool was freezing which was a disappointment - for the children in particular. They only managed a few minutes. It would have been great if they were able to spend more time in the pool after a day walking round.

<Content>Good value for the money Stayed here as part of a convention with the HK Trade Development Council. The price was good, and service was also good. The room was a little dirty, but acceptable. Laundry service was very good but a little expensive. Had a room toward the bay, but the view was mostly of the Police station. Get a room on the upper floors and the view would be great. If I had to, I would stay here again, but the Excelsior is hard to beat.

<Content>Get a good rate or go elsewhere The rooms are nice and this hotel is acceptable as long as you get a really good rate. I did not get my wake up call and my messages never arrived, an issue with food making my guest sick and the pool was closed and due to open the day after I left with no consideration to allow entry the day before. It is a bit of a way from 'the action' of LKF/Central and Wanchai but the MTR is great. The supermarket opposite is a god send and there are some eaterys for breakkie nearby. Only if you get a good rate - try anything but definately do not pay rack rate - much better hotels closer to Central. G

<Content>good value / money; small rooms; good location to subway My son  I had a double room while attending the Rugby 7s (March 30-April 1). We pricelined the room at 50% of suggested 4 star rate, and considering how everything doubles or trebles in price during the 7s, felt we got value. Small room, hard beds. No problems with internet. (hkd 140 / day).Hotel is very convenient to Quarry Bay Subway Exit C (200m) and we ate a great omlette breakfast every morning at Cafe de Coral in the same street for HKD 18 pp. Diagonally across from the McDonalds is a service laundry which washed  folded our clothes for HKD 35 (or the cost of one shirt with the hotel laundry).A small but serviceable fitness club with 2 treadmills, one cross trainer, a bicycle and a rowing machine. A few lifting stations and a stretching area. Gym ball and dumbell rack. Outdoor pool was closed until April 5.You won't entertain clients here, but a good tourist hotel.

<Content>Need a serious refreshment The hotel looks good but rooms seriously need to be refreshed.Don't ask the front desk about internet connection as they have no idea about it works (even if it is written everywhere to ask them for there wireless connection...)The buffet is quite the same every night and as the hotel is not central you don't have many choices to eat around.

<Content>Would pass on this one next time.... Stayed here for 2 days in mid-February 2007. I Pricelined the hotel, and the room was US$95 a night. A decent price for HK, but on the other hand the room I had on the 10th floor was very average. Staff was friendly and efficient. I went to nearby Coral Cafe for breakfast...clean, local, but decent food at a very reasonable price. The Quarry Bay MTR station is a 3 minute walk from the hotel, so that's a plus. But overall I'd not return.

<Content>Best value in Hong Kong We stayed for a week at the Harbour Plaza North Point, in January 2007. We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was very positive.The hotel's location is way out in the suburbs on Hong Kong Island. Its immediate surroundings is mainly offices buildings and there are very few shops nearby. However, its only a couple of minutes' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station, there is a local supermarket directly opposite and a Cafe de Coral (cheap meals) next to that. The hotel is 7 MTR stops from Central, about 12 - 15 minutes' travelling time.The one bedroom suite is fabulous value for money. It has a living/dining room, kitchenette, bedroom and generous bathroom. Unusually for a hotel room, there is stacks of cupboard space. The furnishings are quite tasteful, with the exception of a ghastly carpet pattern. Please, HPNP, do yourselves a favour and upgrade this! The staff were always helpful. When we complained of a bad smell in our initial room, we were promptly moved to a new room that was very satisfactory. We booked our room for about US$138 per night. This has to be about the best value anywhere in Hong Kong.A tip: Ignore the hotel laundry service. Go down the side street on the way to the MTR, and there are two laundries down there. We used one of them and paid HK$23 for up to seven pounds of laundry. Down the same street you'll find the most bakeries that produce fantastic rolls and buns that make a great breakfast, for absolute peanuts.We enjoyed our stay at HPNP and will go there again, for sure!

<Content>Very nice, good for the price, right on the MTR Very nice hotel, comfortable, very good service from the staff.The neighborhood is mostly local, not a tourist area, but the super-efficient MTR (subway) is 3 minutes walk away and whisks you anywhere in minutes. HINT: MTR stations have multiple exits, if you use the wrong one you might have a longish walk to your desitination. For this hotel, use Quarry Bay and remember exit C.It's not quite on the water, so while there is a harbor view from some rooms, it's only about 15% of the view, the rest is blocked by tall buildings. So if you choose to pay for the Harbor View upgrade, which is not very much, keep that in mind.Internet access was reliable but a bit pricy, about $20 US/day maximum, about 50c/min if you used less.The area contains many shops and restarants, just explore and you'll do fine. I found two breakfast places that serve buns with various meats, etc in them and so breakfast was about $1 US and very good. Though not everyone speaks English, it's amazing that when you find yourself trying to communicate with someone who doesn't, somene else will seemeingly come along and helpfully translate. HK folks are very much like that.Bottom line - a very nice hotel at a much lower price than others because it's a 10-minute subway ride away.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay The room was nice with a partial view of the harbour, we had a kitchenette, but no cutlery/crockery/sauce pans etc, which confused us for a day or so, until we turned the cardboard sign around and discovered the english side and found out they are available by a call to house keeping.The staff could speak english Ok and were always helpful.The location is a bit out in the suburbs, (which we liked) as it was good not to be hassled by hawkers while out and about.We had breakfast several times at the hotel and it was nice.We did not use the hotels laundry facilities, but each morning weleft our laundry at the Hung fung laundry (about a block away) and picked it up each afternoon/evening (3 peoples clothes for $28HK)washed, dried and neatly folded, it made our holiday all the better.MTR (Subway) is 100m away, and Island place and Taikoo place shopping centres are close and have food courts, were we mainly ate. Wellcome Supermarket is over the road, Pizza hut, McDonalds are a block away.

<Content>surprisingly good We stayed here for one night on the way back from Eur to Au. There was a huge trade show on in HKK and everything was booked out or v expensive. Ended up here and were happy with it.Near the MTR, real location, very kind early check in and late check out (we were exhausted and desperate for a shower), pleasant staff.Small room, and not that cheap. Pool not bad. A long way to Kowloon by MTR or taxi.

<Content>Very convinient Very good location, just opposite the MTR (metro station).We stayed (me and my wife) at the top floor (33rd) and the view was amazing (harbour view).The room was very clean and the service above average, but the size of the room was small.

<Content>Never again Prior to arrival at this hotel we emailed to confirm room we booked and paid for had two beds, one for my wife and I and one for our teenage daughter. Email from hotel confirmed this was the case. On arrival we were given a small room with one double bed! After speaking to reception staff we were told we could have a room suitable for two beds (1 double plus a roll up) but we would have to pay an extra $800 australian dollars. We were booked for 7 nights and had already paid approx $A1800. Protests were met with a shrug of the shoulder and a comment that hotel rooms in HK were very small.Being late on a Sunday night we agreed to accept placement of a roll up bed in the room which made moving around extremely difficult and uncomfortable. We attempted to change the situation the following day without any success. Saying that the 'harbour view' we were promised was a glimpse would be generous.. Housekeeping/Concierge/door staff were nice but even so we had to request a third towel daily together with other essentials like toilet paper!! I could go on about other shortcomings.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was very clean and nicely furnished and would easily accomodate 2 adults and 3 children. There is an MTR station across the road with easy access to the rest of Hong Kong; the journey to Central takes about 10 minutes. There is a supermarket opposite,if you need to stock up the fridge in the room. We did not explore the vicinity surrounding the hotel so I have no idea what it has to offer. I would definately recommend this hotel as a good base to explore Hong Kong.
