<Content>Basilea should be 2 not 3 star rated We booked in to the Basilea for 7 nights. I would rate this hotel as 2 star . We had a quiet spacious room at the back with a window and shutters that were rusting and hard to open and close,Bedroom and bathroom were clean but in desperate need of decoration.Electric sockets were dodgy and bathroom was tiny with mildew around the ancient shower fittings.Main problem were the fleas that we could see jumping over the slightly damp sheets and feasted on us during the night!The madam at breakfast was very rude when we appeared 10 minutes before breakfast was due to finish and told us off for being so late.Where was the customer service?Location was central and the city's beauty upliflted our spirits on leaving the hotel each morning.

<Content>Repeat perfprmance... The hotel has always been accommodating. Questions or needs are taken care of at any hour. The rooms are a good size and the location so central, I have always felt comfortable and continue to count on the hotel on my visits to Florence.

<Content>Disappointing We were very disappointed with our stay here. We wanted a hotel close to the railway station, and a travel agent recommended the Basilea to us. Location-wise it was okay, but in the end we were glad we were only there for two nights. The room was small and smelly, the wallpaper was peeling from the walls, the bathroom was tiny and didn't even have a toilet paper holder. The towels stank of vinegar, and the hair dryer was rubbish - I could have dried my hair better with a fan. In the hallway, the ceiling was beginning to cave in in some places, revealing some of the electronics above. Shabby. The breakfast was mediocre, and the breakfast staff unhelpful. On top of that, the reception staff we experienced were rather arrogant. If you're just looking for a place to sleep on a budget and don't care about smelly rooms and mediocre service, then I suppose it's okay. But this is definitely not a 3-star hotel.

<Content>Great place to stay We stayed in a nearby hostel for one night and had such a terrible night sleep due to other noisy guests playing music and talking loudly late into the night. We immediately packed our bags in the morning and found this hotel. The staff were so welcoming, kind, and respectful. The room was perfectly air conditioned, quiet, and comfortable. The breakfast was included in the price of the room and was served in a beautiful room and was also a great meal. The reception at the hotel also booked a reservation for us at the Uffizi where we skipped the queue, which was over an hour long.

<Content>Lovely staff, the rest left much to be desired.... We booked two nights at this hotel and were very disappointed. First I would like to say that the lady that greeted us at the desk was absolutely lovely. She was so helpful and very kind and I couldn't have asked for better reception.We were disappointed with the location and the cleanliness of the rooms. The location is less than desirable and not a good location to bring children.There is no water pressure and the blow dryer is completely inadequate. When my friend went to take a shower, there was hair in the shower from the previous guests.We left the hotel the next morning to go on a day trip and upon our return, there were still dirty dishes, dirty towels in the bathroom. It was on the day trip that I learned about the hair in the shower and we called and booked another hotel to stay at. We left this hotel early, even though I had to pay the entire stay (per policy..could not argue that..it was only right) but we were happy to stay elsewhere.Frankly, I'm surprised this is in Rick Steve's book as he had not led us wrong before this hotel.It is ok if you are on a tight budget and again, the staff is very very helpful.

<Content>Hotel Basilea - Disgusting We booked the Hotel Basilea based on Rick Steve's Italy 2007 book. He classifed it as a typical 3-star hotel. Oh my, does he have some things to learn about what a 3-star hotel is. First the lift would only hold one person and one suite case. Once we entered the room, which had a very musty smell I could not believe my eyes. The room was exceptionally small - as I started to look around the room I saw ripped/torn wallpaper, dirty walls, heavily soiled carpets and chair. We had booked for 3 nights and I told my husband (through my tears) that I did not know how I could spend 3 nights in the room - it made my skin crawl. I went to the bathroom to get a tissue to find the floor filthty with remands of the previous guests - the towels from the previous guest had not been changed - their dirty towels still hung on the towel bar and the trash from their stay was still in the trash can. My husband immediately went out to find someone to help. While he was out all I could do was sit on the edge of the bed and cry. I decided to check the bedding and when I pulled backed the pillow case I saw tiny spots of blood from the bed bugs. Fortunately my husband found a travel agent two doors from the hotel who was able to book us into the Grand Hotel Baglioni (which turned out to be a 10 in our book-highly recommend). The travel agent called us a cab to take us there. In all of our travels, and we travel a lot, I have never been in a place so thoroughly disgusting.

<Content>I loved it! I stayed in this hotel when I went with EF Tours my senior year of high school. I loved this hotel! It was one of the best that we stayed in! I found the service great and the fact that you could walk from the hotel to anywhere was an added plus, since that was one of the few places that we were allowed to have free time. I thought that breaksfast was really good and the few that we had from where we ate breakfast was fantastic! I hope to stay there again in the future.

<Content>Tiny rooms expensive rooms  There was a mix up with my reservation at this hotel. I called several times from California to ensure I'd have a room for 2 nights. The hotel was only able to accomodate me for 1 night but said would try hard for a 2nd night. Since I never got a response I booked 1 night with their sister Hotel Ritz, Florence. When I identified myself and asked the hotel's front attendant if there was a vacancy, he (without checking) rudely said NO! to any possible vacancies. I left Hotel Basilea to Hotel Ritz only to find out Hotel Ritz cancelled my reservation because they claimed a person who was to check out the day I was to have this room, had gotten sick and the hotel couldn't give me this room. This sounded like a like lies. The Hotel Ritz sent me to another hotel so I had to take my luggage away to start all over again when I did have a confirmation of this reservation at the Hotel Ritz. Based on this bad experience I will never stay at Hotel Basilea/Hotel Ritz if I visit Florence in the future. I write this review only to help other travelers who visit Italy for 1st. time. and don't know.

<Content>I was not disappointed I was booked into the hotel for a stay of almost two weeks (early March 2007, off season), and arrived with low expectations due to some of the comments on Tripadvisor. My own opinion is that this hotel represents a good value in Florence if you book a room for around 75 euros a night (or less) for a double in the off season and about 100-110 in high. If the price increases beyond that (and the inclusion of this and its sister hotels in various guides may cause that) the value and one's expectations obviously start changing proportionately. Does the wallpaper need replacing? Yes. Are true nonsmoking rooms rare in Italy? Yes. Is this the Ritz or even a Hampton Inn? No. It is a European budget hotel doing a better job than most, in my opinion. One should not expect a modern room, but the furniture is respectable, the beds were firm, the wardrobe was large, and there was a desk. I had the largest double room that I have ever had in anything less than a four star hotel in Europe. I never heard anyone walking above me-- I have no idea if the room was occupied during my stay or not but my guess is the floors are thick. If the people in the room next door are loud you will hear them but that is true of most hotels. The hotel is a five block walk from the train station straight down Via Nazionale then a half block (turn right) on via Guelph. Don't use the station's underground walkway if you have luggage because there are no escalators at the stairways at the other ends. If you take a cab instead it is a straight shot for the cab and should not cost more than 8 euros, probably less, and most of the cost will be the supplement for your luggage (that is what it cost me going the other way which is not a straight shot). The breakfast consists of a coffee bar, fresh croissants and rolls, cereals, fresh fruit and fruit juices, sliced ham and cheese. If you want eggs, a bar half a block away on the corner of Via Nazionale has them for 3 euros. Via Guelph has most of what you need---internet spots (several, including Internet Train, within three blocks with access as low as 2 euros an hour, along with copying machines, faxes, etc) restaurants (the pizzaria on the corner of the next block has a full menu and is good, reasonable, and friendly--a good sized plate of spaghetti carbonara for 8 euros), food stores, bakery, etc. You are within several blocks of the Mercato Centrale (big indoor food market with stalls) and the San Lorenzo Market shopping stalls and there are some additional, excellent restaurants in that area (try the very popular Za-Za, or Flexo next door, both on the Piazza Mercato Centrale. The former may require reservations. An excellent fillet in chianti sauce can be had at the latter for 16 euros. Avoid Cellini which is right nearby as well). The cathedral is 10 minutes walk; the Uffizi is 15. The Accademia and San Marco are five minutes away. I took a cab one day from a spot near the Arno up to the hotel and it cost about 11 euros in late afternoon, if your group wants to skip the walk back after a full day. The area around the hotel is not dangerous but it is not a high-priced tourist neighborhood either. Florence is a vibrant city with a diverse population and that is reflected in this neighborhood. I was a woman alone for six of my days there and I never felt endangered. I found the hotel staff friendly enough (one night desk clerk is a bit stiff) and very helpful, the old imac in the lobby worked when I used it, and my room was not dirty (although the wallpaper, as noted, was dingy). The shower worked fine once I realized that the pressure tended to weaken after the first few minutes. I just had to turn the nob more when it did and that fixed it for that shower. Even with a fairly full hotel they never ran out of hot water while I was there. The shower was very small which is common in European budget hotels from my experience. (A friend was in room 106 and it had a very odd bath/shower combination with restrictive doors. It should be avoided by all but the agile, the young, and the svelte.) There are large rooms with three or four beds available that families or groups of friends will find very economical. I saw one of the four bed rooms and while it had a dormitory feel with the beds lined up closely, it was large enough even with the beds to move around comfortably. Those rooms are sometimes used by groups of students (and professors) for study visits, and it appears that they usually stay on the first floor. If you are concerned about the chance for noise (two such groups were there during my stay and were quiet by 10) ask to be put far away from any such groups. The rooms with balconies look out on nothing special---rooftops and the balconies of surrounding apartments (see photos with other reviews) although I met a couple who had a balcony on the end of the second floor with a view of the cathedral dome. Rooms facing the back will be quieter than those on the street, but the street quiets down a lot in the evening and is not a major traffic route at any time. The balconies are large (I had one) and come with table and chairs, but have the usual drawback that you hear the people on the one next to you and if they are loud that can be a problem. The balcony rooms have french doors instead of a window. Closing the window and shutters cut down on outside noise significantly. I was in room 118. 117 would be preferable because it is not next to the clatter of the breakfast room like 118 is. 116 seems to be the room in the website pictures that has the wrought iron terrace/balcony. I cannot speak to the air-conditioning since it was not hot weather while I was there but the heat seemed fine. If your refridgerator is not working ask them to make sure it is plugged in (it probably isn't) and then give it a few hours to cool down. The rooms come with hair dryers and also packets of shampoo, and other amenities like shower caps. They will do your laundry if you want--- drop off at the front desk by 9 a.m. and it comes back in the early evening, or you can save money and use either the drop off laundry or the self service one, both within a block or so. This hotel wasn't fancy but it was much nicer than I expected and comfortable and convenient. I would stay here again. Hint on Florence: definitely look into the reservation system for entering the Uffizi and the Accadamia. In high season especially you will be glad you did.

<Content>Roof over you head, nothing more Thank goodness our stay in Florence was only 2 nights otherwise we would have definitely found somewhere else.The front desk attendants were as pleasant as they need to be. Our biggest gripe is that the room (#208) was just plain old dirty. Think our initial reaction upon entering was, eewww gross. Stains on the walls, dingy, and grungy. The wallpaper is in need of serious replacement. We booked it on the recommendation of Rick Steve's book, and thought about changing the booking after reading reviews here but didn't, that is a regret. Hotel would be better off ripping the wallpaper off of the walls and painting to help make maintenance and cleaning easier and a higher priority! At least the place was relatively inexpensive @ 110 euros / night.

<Content>smelly We just returned from 2 weeks in Italy, which included 3 days and 2 nights in Florence.  We used Rick Steve's Italy 2006 book to plan our trip. He recommended this hotel in the book. It's not in a great location, although it's close to the train station. About a 10 to 15 minute brisk walk to the center of town.  The room smelled of stale cigarettes. We requested a non-smoking room which they confirmed, but after our arrival and check-in the hotel claimed that they can't prevent people from smoking in the rooms. There were about 6-7 ash trays in this tiny room! Yuck. Anyway, that's all they had, so that's what we got. The water in the shower either scalded you or froze you, and all within a split second. Showering was an adventure! Maybe one positive is that it was quiet even though it's on a mian street.  Everything in Florence is soooo close, so being near the train station is not important.  Again, I would not recommend this place.

<Content>Good value in an ideal location. I stayed here in August 06 and this was probably the best value for money Hotel that I鈥檝e stayed in, in Italy. The staff were extremely helpful, the location couldn鈥檛 have been any better, you could see the Duomo from the bedroom window and could walk almost anywhere. The room was large, the shower / toilet was clean and adequate. The beds / towels are changed daily, the air-conditioning although slightly noisy did what it was meant to do and kept the room at the temperature at which it was set. The breakfast was ideal, with a never-ending supply of fresh orange, tea, coffee etc. The hotel is down a side street just off a busy main road but even with the windows open, you would have to struggle to hear any noise from it. The lift could take four people (of UK size). The computer in the reception area did have a slightly sticky keyboard, but hey it鈥檚 for holiday use and it鈥檚 free 24 / 7. I arrived by plane so I didn鈥檛 have any trouble parking. There is a good selection or caf茅s / restaurants near by (although I would advise that you avoid the Fish Bar). I disagree with most of the other reviews. This is a good quality three-star hotel, which I would certainly return to.

<Content>A dump! This place was a dump. So incredibly noisy (even with the windows closed) that we could not sleep. We cut our trip short by three days to get out of here. The staff was extremely rude. The toilet was situated in such a way that your legs were literally tucked under the sink (you had to sit sideways). It smelled of urine. The air conditioning worked poorly (and since you couldn't open the windows) it was suffocating. It is in a rundown, kind of seedy part of town. The only good thing is that it is around the corner from the laundromat and the trattoria across the street is excellent. I would not recommend this to anyone. It was the low point of a one month trip throughout Italy.

<Content>Reasonable! We (family of five, young children) stayed at this hotel last year for a night. Overall, it wasn't bad at all. I was actually surprised to see the rather poor comments about it on TripAdvisor. Yes, the hotel is old, the rooms are not very big,...But what else is news in Europe (Italy, in particular) at a budget?!We found the staff extremely helpful. The breakfast (included) was good. The elevator was small but hey! it worked!The location was great. Biggest problem: no parking. In fact, as mentioned by another traveller, you have to unload your luggage, and then have the car parked by the valet. However, I didn't find the price of the parking and valet so terrible. I can't recall the exact amount but I remember it was reasonable. In fact, the compulsory valet was perhaps a blessing in disguise as I didn't have to go searching, etc.... took a nice warm bath instead and enjoyed it!!Well, again, don't expect a dazzling six-star hotel, but I certainly disagree with most of the negative comments about this hotel. Overall, it's OK I'd say!

<Content>Old Word Charm, minus the Charm The bathroom had black tiles and the water in the shower vacillated between scalding and freezing constantly. The coffee in the restaurant was probably the worst coffee in Italy. It was quite warm when we were there in late April, and they don't turn on the air conditioners until June, so we had the window open, however, the street noise was so deafening, we had to sleep with earplugs in. The staff people were not super helpful. The ancient iMac in the lobby for free Internet access did not work much of the time and the keyboard was sticky. When the fake flowers on the breakfast table droop, it's time to renovate.

<Content>You can hear your neighbors brushing their teeth! This hotel, as mentioned in previous reviews, is in quite a good location. They charge a fair amount for valet car parking, so do try to find a parking garage yourself (there are a few just around the corner)The room was clean and the staff exceptionally friendly  professional, but that's where the positives end.Firstly- the walls are PAPER THIN. We heard people's tv's, conversations, brushing of teeth, and finally we heard someone throwing up their guts the next morning- lovely.Secondly- it is a very old hotel in major need of some updatingThirdly- that foul smell in the lobby is still lurking, whatever it may be! Awful.I would not recommend anyone to this hotel. Its a shame, though, as the staff are great.

<Content>Avoid this place We stayed at the Hotel Basilea in October 2004 on the basis of a favorable review in the Rick Steves guidebook. At his suggestion, I booked a room on the backside of the hotel away from the street. This turned out to be a big mistake. The back of the hotel faces a courtyard and the noise from the neighboring apartment buildings (which were extremely close to our window) kept us awake almost all of the night. We shut the window, but this did little good. Also, there was a great deal of noise from the other guests in the hotel. Apparently, this place attracts drunken revelers who enjoy congregating in the hall and noisily recounting their bar-hopping exploits in the wee hours. I asked them to keep it down, but it did no good. Our room also was very small and the air conditioning was not working. There was no bathtub (only a shower). The breakfast buffet is a little limited and the quality of the food is average at best. On the basis of this experience and a similar experience at another hotel in Rome, I would recommend not taking guidebook recommendations at face value.

<Content>During the blackout We stayed here two nights in September. Location is close to the station if you exit the station on the right side. The country-wide black-out hit during our first night. We slept through most of it. The staff managed to feed us breakfast by candle-light and even had hot coffee and milk for latte! Alas, no cappachino. We found the room nice enough, didn't notice any noise. We've come to appreciate bath tubs to soak away tourist aches and pains. They have tubs. The terrace was not in use. We'd stay there again probably. Their internet service is bogus, we found an internet cafe nearby and did our email for a couple of bucks. A tiny elevator will take your bags up, but we didn't use it otherwise.

<Content>Stay Away I chose the Hotel Basilea from a review in the Rick Steve's book. I'm not sure when he last stayed at this hotel, but I find that I cannot recommend it. The locationis fairly convenient. However, street noise that he mentions is the least of the hotel's problems. I had a room far removed from the street. The noise problem stems from an absolute lack of soundproofing between rooms. You hear EVERY noise from all adjoining rooms. If you are a single traveler, you should especially stay away from this place. The single room is less than six feet across (I measured). Since most travelers need their hotels rooms primarily for sleep and not for absolute comfort, the noise problems here simply don't fit the bill.
