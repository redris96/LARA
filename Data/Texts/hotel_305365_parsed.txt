<Content>slightly more effort required I did not find this hotel to be dated in its presentation, as stated by some other reviewers; its most serious flaw is that being so handy for the airport it gets plenty of business without having to try too hard, and so, unsurprisingly, the service is not irreproachable.The check-in experience was not too reassuring. In spite of ample bilingual signs displayed in the foyer saying smoking was not allowed here, there were several people smoking quite openly. I pointed out the slight anomaly to the check-in clerk, and requested her to please ask the guests to put out their cigarettes, but she declined to do anything. This was especially annoying because one of the guests in my party was a smoker, who had had the decency to comply with the non-smoking policy when he really wanted a smoke. After the slap-around-the-face check-in experience, there were a few problems in the room. The hot water in the bathroom wasn't remotely hot except for a brief period late in the evening, so a good hot wash/bath/shower on arrival in the afternoon or first thing in the morning was out of the question. We raised the matter of the water not being hot with the front desk and they sent a person to check, but he was clearly unable or unprepared to improve matters, so we didn't get the hot water when we wanted it. On arrival the TV remote didn't work, so we had to send for someone to replace the batteries. Another minor gripe was that the hotel do not stock (we asked) any sachets of milk powder to accompany the complimentary tea and coffee, so unless you like your drinks black you'll be out of luck here.Unlike many travellers I like my hotel beds to be firm, and this one wasn't. In fact it was more like a giant sponge than a bed and neither my wife (who can normally cope with soft beds) nor I had a good night's sleep on our supersized sponges. This may also have been due, however, to the background noise level in the hotel room - a combination of the motorway in the near distance, the central heating, muted aircraft noise, and other guests moving about.On a positive note, the complimentary fruit in the room was a very nice touch, the living space was generous and well lit, and the bathroom and bed linen were well nigh spotless. Also the airport shuttle bus left bang on time. I would stay here again, but it would not be somewhere I would feel a really valued customer.

<Content>Very dated We booked this hotel for one night as we had an early flight out the next morning. The hotel decor is very dated and the corridors smelt of smoke. After having flatscreen TVs thoughout our China tour we felt like we were stepping back into the 1970s. The bathroom was tiny but clean.We ate at the front cafe but the service was incredibly slow - infact my partner had nearly finished his meal before mine got delivered to the table and it was only an open sandwich ! On a positive note the airport shuttle service was prompt and we also used the 2 hourly free shuttle service into the city and return which was useful to pick up some last minute gifts etc. I would only stay again if we had a similarly early flight out and didn't want to risk delays with the Beijing traffic .

<Content>Good Airport Hotel We booked this hotel because we had early departures. On both nights, our room was comfortable, although the air-conditioning is awful. It's quiet enough to open the windows. There is a non-smoking floor, although smoking is allowed in all the restaurants and common areas. If you are arriving before the hotel shuttle is available--or departing at an odd hour--you'll have to pay over $30 for a taxi because no taxi wants to take you on a 5-minute trip. Offer the cab driver $10 as we did, and they might agree to get you there, or pay the going rate for a hotel car, also about $30. Check-in is a problem at odd hours as few of the staff speak English. Hotel restaurants are awful. Chopsticks, the Chinese one, might taste good if you have only had Chinese food in the U.S. It's greasy. Good wine list, though, and of course there's the problem of smokers. There is a good espresso and desert bar outside Chopsticks. The best aspect of this hotel is the excellent travel desk manned mostly by the very efficient and friendly Lindsay during the day. Ask her where to eat in town. Her English is excellent. She even helped us with a hotel merchant who sold us a damaged item.

<Content>Comfortable hotel, shuttle to airport We stayed at the Sino-Swiss Airport Hotel in Beijing, China, before flying home the next day. Airport personnel met us at the airport and took us to the hotel in the shuttle. Everyone was very helpful and our room was comfortable. If you are visiting the famous Beijing sites, the hotel can book you onto various tours, but it is not in the center of town. Good if you have a flight out. Internet access is expensive (3 RMB per minute and 6 RMB for each page printed). There are several dining options within the hotel. Breakfast selection was extensive.

<Content>Only if nothing else is available In 1980 I'm pretty sure this was the place to stay.The decor, the infrastructure, the gym and unfortunately the linens all seem to have aged somewhat ungracefully.It wasn't a total bust- Chop Sticks restaurant was surprisingly good and it took less than 10 minutes to get to the airport. Since I stayed there overnight just to make a very early morning flight it ended up being a mildly unpleasant but safe place to hang out.The bar scene was straight out of Lost in Translation but pleasant.If you're considering the Sino-Swiss for anything but an overnight stay (i.e. for the Olympics), I'd think again.The bed had a 'kitcheny' smell and while the staff was competent and kind, it couldn't make up for the run-down facilities.Great for a night's sleep but don't stay here if you're expecting any grace.

<Content>Not bad but could be better Stayed for six nights while attending the Beijing Auto Show and it didn't do a bad job. There were a few issues - lost my reservation (but soon found), bed very uncomfortable, severe plumbing issue (don't ask!) on one day and air con not switched on (just ambient air). But the European restaurant remarkably good and breakfast fine if a bit pricy. Staff friendly - overall exceeded expectations but hardly somewhere to set the pulses racing.

<Content>A nixe place to rest a weary head... This hotel is perfect for those of you with just a night or two in Peking, an early flight out and seeking the need to rest your weary head and bones! The staff are extremely pleasant and the rooms ticked all the required boxes. Taxis from the airport cost between 14 and 50 CY (!) depending upon the financial situation of the driver (just a 10 minute drive to Terminal 3), while taxis to the forbidden city were in the range of 100 - 150 CY (15-22 US). Thus, even if you are in town for just a night you can easily pop into Peking and see Chairman Mao cast his icy gaze over Tiaanamen Square. It is just a terrible shame that so many young men and woman were slaughtered on that site not too many years ago. Still, this hotel gives the passing traveller the perfect opportunity to drop into the city, pay their respects and fly home to their loved ones.

<Content>Shows its age, but comfortable for airport recovery Other reviewers have been pretty fair. We were expecting the hotel to show its age in places, and it did, mostly in the hallways to hotel room. The lobby on the other hand was clean and nice, and the service staff attentive and helpful. We requested an early morning shuttle (150 yuan) because the free shuttle didn't start until 6 am and we needed to check out at 5 am. Check out was smooth, we were charged what was quoted, and most importantly, the limo showed up on time and got us right to the airport.I should also mention that the free shuttle pickup at the airport went smoothly too. For new terminal 3 at the airport, the hotel said I'd need to find their agent to arrange the shuttle, and I kept my fingers crossed. Well, upon getting out of the baggage claim, there he was! Always reassuring for wearied travelers.The hotel room was mostly OK. The carpets were dirty, but the bed was clean and comfortable. The sink/shower area were very nice, as others noted well stocked with not only shamppos and soaps, but also sewing kits, shoe polishing kits, shammy cloth, etc.The toilet was in a separate room, very narrow/claustrophobic.Dinner at the Chopsticks restaurant was OK - neither awe-inspiring or dreadful. We were pretty conservative in what we sampled though there were much more extravagant items on the menu. So we may not have given the restaurant that much chance to shine.My bottom line: I'd go back again for an airport-related stay. Can't imagine using this as a base for several days in Beijing, though.

<Content>Good place to stay near beijing airport We booked this hotel to spend our last night in china at beijing airport before flying home. The hotel is not in the airport it is 15-20 minutes away by taxi - but still closer than going into beijing. Our flight was delayed so we arrived later than planned - the check in was quick and efficient. The rooms were fine. We were short of time and so we ate in the western restaurant in the hotel - the food was fine and the service was ok - except for a few resident mosquitoes. We were off early but one of us went to the gym and pool early am - these were very nice. Check outr efficient and courtesy bus good. Overall a good place to spend a night if flying out from beijing am. staff helful, clean, not 5* but OK.

<Content>Nice place if you want to be near the airport This hotel is very convenient to the airport and our room was quite clean and nice. We reserved a standard room and were upgraded (possibly because we requested 3 beds and they couldn't fit them in the standard room?). The beds were very soft, for those who don't like the standard hard beds found in most hotels in China. And it was very clean. Convenient if you have an early flight out the next morning - we only stayed one night for that reason. If you are looking for a base for travels in Beijing then don't stay here - it's a long cab ride into the city, and although they do have a shuttle that is free, it runs very infrequently. There are overpriced shops in the hotel if you need to do last minute gift buying, and a ridiculously priced internet use computer (pay by the minute!). We didn't try the restaurant. Also there is a big grocery store across the street for your food and drink needs.My main complaint is not about the hotel itself, but the cabs. We had very good experiences with the honesty of Chinese people and services throughout our trip. But for some reason the cab drivers we got to and from the airport for this hotel both tried to cheat us (no where else did this happen). I guess they don't like that it is such a short trip. The first guy, from the airport, had a meter but refused to run it and kept insisting on a very high price (it should be only the base fair to get to the hotel). We had to tell him to let us out on the street and we found another cab to take us. The second guy didn't have a meter (from hotel to airport) and when we got there he tried to charge us a ridiculous price. He sort of tried to keep one of our bags but I made like I was going to give him money and he put the bags down so we picked them up and walked away after paying him only a very small amount more than he should have earned. He yelled but wasn't going to come after us. None of the cabbies speak english and my Mandarin is just 4 months of private study for the trip, but that was enough to save us from these situations. If you don't speak Mandarin, make sure cab drivers start the meter BEFORE they start driving and if they don't, just get out and get another cab. They all understand the word meter and a finger pointing at it.

<Content>Checked in - Checked out Wow, where to start. By accident I booked this hotel and the Park Plaza. Thank god I did becasue this place is a dump.Please see my review on the Park Plaza which is a great hotel.When I arrived at the airport there was a guy waiting with a sign to take me to the hotel by shuttle bus. I sat on the hot bus for almost 25 minuted waiting for others to get on. Little did I know that the others were airport employees getting a free ride to a resturant near the hotel. Very inconvienent.When I got to the hotel the lobby was really run down. i checked in and proceeded to my room.The room was horrible. Very small and stale. No internet, phones circa 1800, and the bathroom was tiny and had the ugliest shower curtain I have ever seen.Needless to say I was out of there in under 10 minutes.I wouldnt even recommend this hotel to someone with a few hour layover.Its just horrible.To top it all off they charged me $440RMB for a day stay.I promise you I wasnt in the room for more then 3 minutes.You live and learn.

<Content>Not so nice There's little reason to spend a night at this hotel unless you have an early morning flight and don't want to get up at the crack of dawn. (Most of the guests seemed to be airline crew; it's obviously convenient for them.) Compared with many other hotels in China, this hotel is more 3-star than 4-star (though we paid at least 4-star prices). It's OK if you don't expect too much. Apart from the foyer, it has low ceilings, narrow corridors, and a generally uninviting ambiance. Our room was fairly small and basic, and the bathroom had seen better days. There was no double glazing which meant the window needed to be closed because of the flights going directly overhead (though they did appear to stop overnight). Maintenance was poor - when I removed the paper cover from a glass tumbler I was lucky not to cut myself as the top of the tumbler had been shattered (maybe a previous customer had broken the tumbler and replaced the cover - but it should have been checked). Next time I think I'd prefer to stay 'down-town' and get up a bit earlier. If you do stay there, it's worth making time for a stroll around the village (just outside the gates of the hotel) which is something of an antidote to the skyscrapers and bright lights of Beijing.

<Content>Not a big fan of the Sino-Swiss Hotel. Certainly not 5 Star... I'm pretty sure none of the people who rated this as 4 or 5 stars have actually stayed in a 4 or 5 star hotel!At best...this hotel is 3 stars...at best.This hotel is HIGHLY overpriced. The place is drab and the rooms are pretty basic...although yes...we did have HBO and there was food to suit western tastes. (Small consolation...)We found a few of the staff were friendly and a few spoke english. Nowhere near the level of service you should be receiving for $200 US/nt.I spend 10-12 nights a month in hotels around the world, (I suppose you could consider me a SME, Subject Matter Expert), and if this is what Beijing has to offer for luxury and comfort, then the world is going to be seriously disappointed in 2008,(Olympics!).Although convenient to the airport and walking distance to some decent restaurants, I would absolutely avoid this hotel if you could.

They acussed me and some friends of taking something from the minibar - they acussed us of lying. In the few hours we were there we didn't even see there was a minibar. And we had to pay, because we didn't have the time to prove we were right.Line Jakobsen

<Content>4 stars you have to be kidding Well where do I start. The rooms are small and dirty and I have to mention the smell. The rooms stink, and I mean not just stink they smell really bad. The beds are hard and the duvee/doona is about as think as a sheet of newspaper but with much less warmth. Luckily I missed the noise of the disco due to my very early check-in and it was closing. Only plus is it is close to the airport.

<Content>Great Find in Bejing I am surprised to read some of the bad reviews of this place. I loved it! I stayed here because my work booked us here and I was very pleased. The travel agent downstairs can book you anywhere and get you a great discount. They are very eager to help you. The food was wonderful and very accomadating to Western tastes. There is a great bar there that has a wonderful atmosphere and a very interesting Asian band. You can bargain in the shops and find some neat finds. The toilets are Western style both in the rooms and in the lobby. I think they did renovate this hotel so some rooms are redone and the others are in the process but very clean and nice. I stayed here both coming and going so I have seen both syles. Everybod I met spoke English so there wasn't a language barrier. I would stay here again because the service is great and the rooms are large and comfy.

<Content>Horrifying We had the misfortune of staying at this hotel on the way in and out of China. The best quality of this hotel is its proximity to the airport. The food was also okay. On both occasions of our stay, our room was like a sauna. We were told that the goverment forces them to shut off the air conditioning. Doubtful, since other hotels in Beijing seemed to have air conditioning, but they, of course were 5 star hotels. If you did open the windows to get air, swarms of bugs flew in or, alternatively, you were treated to the smell of jet fuel. We were traveling with approximately 80 other people and their experience was similar. Both rooms we stayed in were grimey, at best. We tried not too look to closely at the bathroom floor and NEVER took our shoes off while walking around. To rate this hotel a 4 or even 3 star is extremely generous. We would never stay here again nor recommend that anyone else stay.

<Content>A real Dump! We stayed our last night in Beijing at the Sino-Swiss hotel to be close to the airport for a morning flight. This was probably the most run down hotel we have stayed at in a long, long time. It reminded me of an aging Holiday Inn that hadn't been renovated since who knows when. Stained and torn carpeting and a musty smelling room added to the ambiance We should have continued our stay at the Novotel, which was great, and get up an hour earlier to reach the airport. Avoid this place if possible

<Content>It's Not The Sheraton, But It's Great I'd looked at the info on their website before going over. We were booked here through our adoption agency so we didn't have a lot of say. The only other people on the van ride over from the hotel were an Aeroflot flight crew. An airline that's near bankrupt sticks them at the Sino-Swiss. Not a good sign. The air pollution was choking on arrival. We were tired. So were not in a great mood when we got there. The overall room condition? All right. This place must have really been hopping and in it's prime when Nixon went over in '71. Oh, and another group that was at the hotel were thirty Brazilian college students who were stranded in China because of some scheme where they were going to travel the world as sales people, but the company was a fraud, they got there and were stuck for 60 days at the Sino-Swiss Hotel. Odd.Got a good nights sleep and then discovered what a true pearl in the rough this place is. Outstanding restaurants. You HAVE to do the Mongolian place in the courtyard. The staff could not have been nicer. It was really a nice little hotel. And i would stay here again if that says anything. I had gone in with a bad attitude. They changed it.The only downside? It's ten miles or so from the rest of Beijing. It's really far away from the temples, the sights and the sounds. Cabs are cheap, so that's always an option. But on our first trip over we'd stayed at the Radisson which was within walking distance seemingly of everything. I didn't really feel like walking around the Sino-Swiss.
