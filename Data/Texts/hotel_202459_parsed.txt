<Content>Favorite hotel in Berlin One of my favorite places to stay in Berlin. Great location, the rooms are on the small end but nicely designed, good service / friendly staff, free wifi. Love the enormous aquarium in the center of the hotel. Overall you get great value for your money. The only complaint we've had are that the room cards - that also operate the elevator - are pretty unreliable.

<Content>Fabulous Radisson We recently stayed at the Radisson for five nights on a bed and breakfast basis.This is a very classy and beautiful hotel with an impressive aquarium in the lobby. Definitely one of the best city hotels I have stayed in.The location is fantastic. The hotel is close to shops, restaurants and many historic sites.The rooms were clean and comfortable. Room service was good.The pool and spa areas were very clean and in good working order. The spa area was great for relaxation. The buffet breakfast was good and there was plenty of choice.The noodle bar at the hotel was average. The drinks at the bar were expensive, but that's probably expected in a five star establishment.On the negative side,the electric key for the room were not always reliable.The male concierge was somewhat arrogant. The female concierge was polite and very helpful.

<Content>Great choice for Berlin We spent three nights at the Radisson, and were pleasantly surprised at every turn. The room is modern, and well thought out. Almost everything you would need is here--comfortable beds, flat screen TV, high speed Internet access, in room safe, hair dryer, iron/ironing board, Nespresso coffee maker, plenty of outlets, etc. The only thing we didn't have was a clock (suggestion to hotel). I want to re-do our bathroom at home, now that I've seen the one in our hotel room. Heated floors, large mirror, magnifying makeup mirror, separate toilet area with a creative swinging door to divide up the two spaces. We had a business class room that overlooked the Spree river, and the Dom Berliner cathedral was so close that I couldn't fit the entire thing into the frame of my camera when I went to take a photo of it. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. Our breakfast each morning (included in our room rate) was plentiful and there was a wide selection of items, including someone who would make an omelet for you to your specifications. The hotel is located on a major street, but traffic noise at night was not a problem. We could walk about 1/2 block to pick up the #100 bus which stops at most of the major tourist sites. We visited at this time of year with the intention of going to the Christmas markets. There were two large markets located within a very short walking distance of the hotel. We could also walk to the TV tower. All in all, this hotel was a hit. No disappointments.

<Content>Modern design and awesome aquarium Very nice hotel with an awesome aquarium in the atrium lobby, cylinder shaped and about five stories high. Beautiful design in the rooms as well as in the common areas. Small gym and pool, three different saunas (however, the steam sauna out of work when I wanted to use it). Not so reliable electronic key cards for room and elevator...

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We stayed in The Radisson for two nights and cannot really fault it in anyway.As other reviews have mentioned the acquarium in the lobby is quite a sight to behold , the rooms were spotless and well furnished, the breakfast was as good as any hotel we have stayed in and the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly.In terms of location you could not get antybetter with the bars, clubs and cafes of Hackescher Markt five minutes walk away and The Shops of Alexanderplatz ten minutes, a 25 minute walk will also take you through Museum Island to the Brandburg gate via Unter Den Linden

<Content>Swish hotel, with everything you need presented beautifully I love this hotel. I've stayed here before and it is just so swish and unique with the huge aquarium in the lobby. I got a sea view so I could enjoy it the whole time I was there. And this is the best hotel breakfast I've ever had anywhere. You possibly name it and they have it, and if not, just tell them and they'll make it for you. And the restaurant downstairs, Noodles, if just delicious and is open late. I went twice and it was just what I needed. The gym is also good, especially the small lap pool where you swim against the current. It's very clean and peaceful in that spa-like area. Just overall a very classy hotel. The only possible negative, this time and last time I'm afraid, is the concierge who acts so put out when asked to do anything. Otherwise, it's brilliant.

<Content>Problems at the Radisson I have to agree with the traveller from Ft. Worth, who wrote about the Radisson SAS in Berlin.We stayed in august for 7 nights, and throughout the stay the service and the maidservice were so inconsistent, that it just did not feel like a 5-star hotel.From the arrival, where our business-class room didn麓t have a balcony as promissed, to the morningpaper that arrived at 10 o麓clock(4 out of 7 days. 3 days it it didn麓t arrive at all). I had to ask for the coffee for the in-room Nespresso maschine, fruit-plate was left to rot beside the bed, the flower in the bathroom got so tired it fell asleep down the side of the vase and was laying on the sink, ect. I got the feeling, that they just didn麓t care at this hotel.I will go back to Berlin for New Years, but i will stay somewhere else.

<Content>Great Location, But Some Problems The location of this hotel is wonderful. Easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and historic sights. My room was well appointed. I do wish that the staff were more accomodating. I didn't have any bottled water left in the fridge in my room and so I went down to the bar that is just off the main lobby and asked for a glass of water. I was told to Sit down and we will bring it to you. I did just that, but no one ever came to bring me the glass of water. I then walked over to the front desk, and requested that some bottled water be brought up to my room from room service. It didn't come, so I then had to leave the hotel, walk to a restaurant up the street, where they sold me some bottled water, that I brought back to my room. My room was not cleaned until very late in the day even though I had the Please clean my room sign hung on my door since early morning. In short, if the service at this hotel were up to par, it would be a good choice. Because I couldn't even get a glass of water or a bottle of water at this hotel, I will look elsewhere for my next stay. Oh, and on check out, they had charged me for the bottled water that they did not bring me, so of course, I protested , and they reluctantly took it off of my bill.

<Content>You will not be disappointed! Reasonably priced, top class hotel in a very dynamic city of Berlin. I stayed there for a weekend in August, city was full of tourists yet this hotel offered much better deals than other hotels of similar class. It is located right next to the museum island close to the opera and unter der linden street. It is within 15-20 min walking distance from the Brandenburg Gate. Reading this review you probably already know that it has this huge aquarium right above the lobby and high up to the roof which could be seen from many of the rooms. It is quite fascinating and definitely a great idea! Rooms are clean and modern with some nice amenities. Try the pool which although small allows you to relax after a busy day. Breakfast although really good is expensive and I myself preferred to explore some nearby local eateries to get some good food to start off the day. In fact there are quite a few interesting places close to the hotel which are not always full with tourists. Try especially Barcomi's Deli at Sophienstrasse which is definitely one of the best places to get a good bagel in Berlin! Also, check pubs, restaurants and clubs at the Hackescher Markt. Both places are 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel. Those are places for young, easy-going people who look to have fun in Berlin. I also had a dinner in one of the city's fancy restaurants - Bocca di bacco, and it is really a fine place (very romantic with great ambience) which I have reviewed in a separate review. In short, Radisson SAS Berlin is a top class hotel, with nice, modern design, good facilities and friendly staff, located in the center of a great city. I cannot really write anything bad about it. Definitely recommended!

<Content>Superlative European business hotel Having stayed here twice, I can confirm all the enthusastic comments about this hotel. It is brilliantly well located close to the Alexanderplatz S-Bahn station and the Museum Island, and has a spectacular interior layout with the much-remarked lobby fish tank (but beware: though you can see it, to go inside the tank you have to leave the hotel and pay for entry). Rooms are extremely well-appointed, service impeccable, and the main restrauant excellent both for dinner and buffet breakfast. On future Berlin visits I will certainly stay here again.

<Content>Excellent location  Stayed at the hotel for a weekend. Originally booked a business class room but was lucky enough to be upgraded to a junior suite. The room facilities were excellent with two LCD TVs, extra large bed, expansive bathroom, comfortable chairs and a settee as well as free wifi. There was also a safe and nespresso machine. Service was brilliant, the hotel was clean and the food was good. The location was excellent with the TXL airport bus stopping only 100 yards from the hotel. The highlight within the hotel was the massive aquarium which stretched from almost the floor to the ceiling!I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will certainly stay there again when I return to Berlin.

<Content>Nearly perfect Just had a fabulous weekend in Berlin and loved the Radisson. We had a business class room which overlooked the river and the cathereral. The room was very clean with all the usual amenities..iron, board, lovely toiletries and unusually for Germany an esspresso coffee machine. The fish tank is amazing and we enjoyed a lovely breakfast in the atrium watching the beautiful fish and laughed when the divers enter the tank to clean the glass. The HEat restaurant is a little basic, but then not too expensive either, there is a strange Indian fusion theme to the restaurant. The service from the reception to the bar and restaurant staff was very attentive and extremely friendly.If there were any negatives they would be-As business class you get free pay movies, however none of these were in English so there is little point in this.We were offered free newspapers each day, we actually only got one on Saturday and this was an American paper not an English one. Only one thing annoyed me over the weekend. Coming in on Saturday night after a night out we decided to go down to the cocktail lounge for cofffee and brandies. I suppose its partly our fault for just ordering and not checking the price but we were charged 鈧?5 each for the brandies, in anyones book this is taking the mick....... I dont mind paying extra for a special room or extras but I hate being ripped off and this was stopped me awarding this hotel a 5, the cocktail lounge was quiet...no wonder

Not only does it have a 25 metre aquarium going through the middle of the hotel, but your room opens on to a vista of 2.500 tropical fish swimming by.The staff were extremly helpful when I needed somebody to translate for me into German, and the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful. As somebody who very rarely stays at 5 star hotels, I can guarantee there IS a big difference between 3 stars and five. Included was a breakfast that had an enormous v ariety of fare that would appeal to every culinary taste.It's one hotel I would definatly go back to

<Content>Excellent Hotel I stayed at this hotel alone and felt extremely safe. My room was gorgeous with a view of the Cathedral and it had small balcony also. Breakfast was included in my rate and although buffet, was of an extremely high quality. The gym facilities where limited but were of a high standard. I cannot comment on the pool or spa area, but they did look very good. All in all, this hotel was a very good choice. It was close to Alexanderplatz and Hackerst Markt, so was in an excellent location for travelling about. There are some excellent bars and restaurants in the area - Reinhards was an exceptionally good restaurant.

<Content>I'm a tough hotel critic but I loved the SAS Radisson in Berlin We left our original hotel to switch to the SAS Radisson after the staff treated us like VIP when my husband had a business conference there. I took my 1 year-old daughter to wait in the lobby while my husband finished his event. Without knowing who they were, the Assistant GM and the head of guest services/reservations came over to us to offer coloring paper and pencils, a stuffed bear with an SAS Radisson robe (my daughter still clutches it and we call it her Berlin bear!). They won us over that evening. We went back to the hotel booked by my husband's company and I woke up saying, we're switching to the SAS. They offered us an amazing room and we ate at the breakfast buffet. An example of the service: we asked for a wet, cloth napkin for my daughter as she finished making a mess with her breakfast. The next morning, minutes after sitting down, the waitress brought a wet, cloth napkin in a silver bowl and placed it next to my daughter. It was thoughtful and personal. Between her, the senior staff, the adorable doorman with the curled up, white, mustache, and the cleaning person who cleverly propped up my daughter's teddy bear in her crib, we loved every minute of the fish-filled aquarium lobby and hotel. We have stayed at many hotels around the world and this was one of the most memorable hotel stays of all times! Tell the GM that baby Mia from NY sent you and she will be back as an adult one day.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in a perfect location Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel and I have to say I cant fault it at all. I'd read lots of reviews before booking and my expectations were high but it was even better than I'd imagined. I've got to say its one of the most impressive hotel lobbies I've seen, the aquarium is a must see.We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful throughout our stay and although our room was fairly basic (we had only paid for a basic room) it was modern and very clean. We were on the first floor and were facing on to the main road but couldnt hear any noise from the road at all.The location is just fantastic. I have to say I didnt realise Berlin was such an enormous city but the Radisson is just in an ideal spot. It was cold and wet while we were there but I could imagine it would be fantastic to sit out and have a drink or meal in the summer by the river.We ate in the noodle bar for lunch and the food was lovely. We didnt try the other restaurant but breakfast was a great experience but then it always is at Radisson hotels.The pool is a little on the small side, but the whole leisure facilities are great and so clean.Overall for the price we paid for this hotel I couldnt have been happier and when we go back to Berlin this will be my first choice of hotel !

<Content>Lovely looking hotel but appearances can be deceptive! I just got back from a four day girls-only break to this hotel; never been to Berlin before but must say that the Radisson is in a great location. It was just around the corner from a major shopping centre and within walking distance to museums, monuments and sites of interest!Hotel looks great on the outside, and the reception area with its giant indoor aquarium is amazing but thats where it stops. Our party had booked two twin rooms with adjoining doors but when we arrived at 12.30, we were told we had to wait till 3pm as the adjoining rooms were not available. We waited till 3pm but then were promptly told that the rooms were still not ready so we must wait till 5pm. As we were so tired we decided to just take two rooms on the same floor instead but were disappointed as this was not what we booked. We were then given the keys by the receptionist and made to find the rooms by ourselves. We were not told anything about the facilities in the hotel or even told when and where breakfast was served. Then when we got to the rooms the 'twin rooms' consisted of two single beds pushed together to form a double. They were not even separated for our arrival; when we did pull them apart the headboard did not extend long enough and so we barely got them a foot apart. Every morning the cleaning lady would then push the beds together again despite our obvious wishes to keep them apart. The rooms were more 3/4 star standard than 5. They were very small and there were no robes or slippers, no bottled water, turn down services or even biscuits with the tea and coffee. All these you would expect in a 5 star hotel, especially as we had paid 5 star rates. Downstairs, the restaurants and bars were overpriced by cheaper Berlin standards. The Thai restaurant was lovely but the Heat restaurant was a bit of a disaster. I ordered Monkfish and got three tiny separate pieces of rather mangy looking fish, no bigger than three chunks of scampi; it was fatty, veiny and poorly cooked, I couldn't even eat two bites of it. Very disappointing for a five star restaurant. The spa area was however lovely and I got a great massage for 鈧?0! There were definitely good and bad points about this hotel but overall I would rate it as fairly average. I would definitely try to find a hotel in a similar location, but if you are going to pay for a five star then I wouldn't go with the Radisson.

<Content>excellent hotel. perfect for getaway. Stayed in this hotel 4 nights over Easter 2008. Fabulous location 鈥?really couldn鈥檛 get any better. Only a 10-15 minute stroll to Brandenburg gate  Reichstag down the beautiful Unter Den Linden. 20-25 minutes to Potsdamer Platz. Alternatively it鈥檚 around 鈧? in a taxi. Metro and Tram services are excellent and close by. Hotel is right adjacent to Berliner Dom (Berlin Cathedral) and the Museum Island with a huge choice of museums. Hackescher Market with it鈥檚 bars and restaurants is only an 5 minute walk away.Hotel itself is very impressive. Rooms very large with big bathrooms and a walk-in shower (unusual in European Hotels). We had a room facing out towards the aquarium 鈥?it鈥檚 beautiful to look at the fish from your balcony at night. Although the reception and bar area is below your window you cannot hear a single sound as the very thick, floor to ceiling glass balcony doors are soundproofed. As too are the room doors so you cannot hear any other guests or morning maid service in the hallways. The only downfall of an inner room is that you cannot get fresh air through an open window. If you prefer an outside room ask for one on an upper floor facing towards Berlin Catherdral only some 100 yards away.Staff are exceptionally helpful and courteous. Breakfast buffet is superb. There is a very nice Spa in the basement with small pool, sauna, steamroom and other therapy spa options. Be warned 鈥?the sauna and steam room does not permit swim wear i.e. it鈥檚 nude (and mixed) with a towel for modesty if you prefer.My only 2 complaints are:-1. Whilst the aquarium is positioned in the hotel lobby/bar area it is not actually part of the hotel but belongs to the Aqua Dom next door. Thus in order to take a ride in the elevator up through the middle of the huge cylindrical aquarium you must pay an entrance fee to the Aqua Dom which is expensive. Sadly the hotel advertisements give the impression the aquarium is part of the hotel, however you can still enjoy stunning views of the aquarium.2. The pillows are awful, too soft. Unfortunately the hotel does not offer a pillow service and has no alternative to the ones in the room (I asked and failed). The lack of a pillow service is remarkable for a 5 star hotel.

<Content>Great choice We just stayed three nights at the Radisson SAS in Berlin and have not regretted the choice at all. We chose the business rooms which was absolutely worth it since it came with some extras such as amazing view and a small balcony. The location next to the Museumsinsel and Alexanderplatz is just perfect, buses 100 and 200 bring you quickly anywhere. The room itself has a good size, though not huge, the same goes for the bathroom. The lobby with the amazing Aquarium has been praised numerous times already here and is really a nice attraction. Service was friendly, efficient and the breakfast buffet was well appointed and tasty with mixed hot and cold food available.The only minus points I would give to the wellness area which for a 5 Star Hotel should be better maintained, the steam room seemed mouldy. There was also no jacuzzy which many guests would appreciate after a long walk in town.

<Content>Loved the Radisson SAS Berlin-Style, Atmosphere, Location Chose the Radisson based on TripAdvisor write-ups. It was all we hoped for and more. The location is superb for sights as well as transportation options. The hotel is only a few years old, well maintained and stylish in a modern European sort of way. There is a huge fish tank in the lobby onto which our two double rooms faced. Even without the balcony, one could imagine being in the fish tank. The lobby is quite busy, but with the doors to balcony closed, you heard nothing. Rooms were a decent size, nicely decorated, and well designed, as were the bathrooms. The lobby has a nice bar area. There are several restaurants in the hotel, but they, as well as the breakfast/brunch, are quite expensive. The bellboy who greated us was delightful and had many helpful tips. The staff at the reception desk were also extremely pleasant. The only staff member with whom we did not have a pleasant experience was the male concierge who often ignored us while he was on his cellphone, with what seemed not to be hotel business, and who was not particularly helpful and at least once downright rude. We did not let this influence our impression of the hotel. We do highly recommend taking a walking tour with Inside Berlin. If all the tour guides are anything like ours, it will be a fascinating four hour tour. We loved it despite the cold, rainy weather. We also recommend lunch or dinner at the restaurant at the Reichtag where the food is amazing and the view comparable. We also had a great dinner at our tour guide's recommendation at Schwartzwaldstuben in an interesting neighborhood and excellent, well priced German food without tourists and great atmosphere. The chocolate shops that surround the hotel on either side should not be missed, especially the hot chocolate. Steer clear of the restaurant Borchadt, which despite being recommended to us by friends, and despite having a German relative make the reservation for us in advance, had a rude manager, terrible service and mediocre food despite the high price with the US exchange rate. We were sent to a table in the basement, which looked like a basement, without our reservations being checked (even after protesting), and with open tables upstairs in the historical section. Overall we had a great trip, taking in many sights, but did not cover everything in four days. Would have liked to add a trip outside the city.

<Content>A large fish tank is not enough We booked our stay for the Easter weekend in a standard room. The hotel is very centrally situated and has a wow factor in the reception atrium with its awe-inspiring aquadrome. This is normally a pay-to-see commercial attraction separate from the hotel, and it has the unfortunate disadvantage of constantly crowding the lobby with passing pedestrians having a free look from the hotel side.Our room was adequate if a little small but was clean and well presented. Our stay entitled us to a bottle of champagne on arrival in the room, but this turned out to be a bottle of German sekt when it arrived. It took a telephone call from us to the manager before room service would replace it with the genuine article.Dinner on the first night in the restaurant H-eat was less than expected. The food was disappointing in presentation and flavour and our main dishes achieved an unusual condition in that they were both over-cooked and cold. Our disapointment was compounded with the arrival of the bill 鈧?46 for just 2 courses and wine. Indeed one of the most consistent things with this hotel is its high prices for less than perfect drinks, food and service. Drink prices in the reception bar were high by comparrison with other 5 star Berlin hotels with which we are familiar.Breakfast had to be queued for and it is not ideal to be given the option of breakfast in the reception atrium while being gawped at by tourists along with the fish!One very unpleasant experience in both the restaurant and the lobby bar area was the mass of fruit flies that became a constant and annoying nuisance. Perhaps the hotel will try to remove the nuisance at some stage - certainly staff seemed not to care.The main issue with the hotel is it's 5 star status. I would question any establishment who uses this label while not providing basic 5 star amenities in rooms. No bathrobes or slippers, no mineral water, no CD player, one towel per guest per day, no turn-down service, and poor quality toiletries and absence of simple items such as cotton buds, nail files and hair conditioner. Needless to say, all higher-price rooms offer these but as the place isn't cheap to begin with and it claims to be 5 star why the difference between this and other 5 star operations in Berlin?I do not find a large fish tank sufficient reason to go back and if I ever see another fruit fly it'll be too soon!

<Content>Great hotel, perfect location! A simply perfect stay in every respect! Excellent quality rooms and hotel, with super friendly staff from bell boy to spa staff. The sea life aquarium in the middle of the reception hall is certainly outstanding. A wide selection of everything you might think of at breakfast. Located next to the Berlin Dom, you can easily reach the famous quarters of Nikolaiviertel and Hackesche H枚fe in a few minutes by foot. This is great for going out in the evenings. Funkturm and Rotes Rathaus are just minutes away. Next time we go to Berlin we will certainly book the Radisson again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, great tourist location - Pity about the service Very happy with hotel location. Very happy with the overall feel of the hotel. Room lovely, great view. Perfect for the first two days!Booked HEat Retaurant for Sat night. Table for 2, gave room number etc but a table for 4 was prepared. We felt like it was our mistake. Ok we were given a choice of tables but not a choice in waiters !!. While the guy tried he was a trainee and it showed. We were very happy with the food but when we asked for an additional side oder to go with the main course we waited 15/20 mins. The waiter was busy taking other orders serving tables etc, but he was over stretched. When the side order eventually came it was not exactly what we ordered. It was a mixture. The moment was lost ! We went to the lounge for a night cap - no harm done, these things happen !! We had a drink and decided that we would have another. Approx. 20 mins after we ordered the drink we gave up. The waitress was a very nice girl but said that it was very busy and apologised. There was one person sitting at the bar and maybe 6 to 8 others in the lounge area.We are very slow to complain (see my other reviews of other hotels) but I'm afraid we were disapointed.

We had a room with view to the Dom. Fabulous, ask for such a room. Clean,VERY trendy,hip,centrally BUT expensive. that is it

<Content>A must try!!! This is a great hotel in a great location, in a great City! If you arrive at Schoenefeld airport you can get a train from there to Alexanderplatz station for only 2.10 euro and it only takes 20 minutes on the express train. From Alexanderplatz station the hotel is only a 5 minute walk away.The hotel is located at the end of the Unter Den Linden and beside the Berliner Dom. Its a very central location close to many tourist sites for walking but also close to U  S Bann transport networks for other sites.The hotel is well worthy of its 4 star status. The rooms are well presented, well equipped but most of all extremely well maintained. The staff were always friendly and willing to help with any request. A special mention is required for the buffet breakfast which runs each morning from 6 to 10.30am. The variety on offer each day is astounding and its all fresh! It is one of the few hotels in Berlin to have its own swimming pool, which is a great form of relaxation after a hard days sightseeing. You should also try the Noodle restaurant in the hotel (great food at reasonable prices).I cannot go without mentioning the vast aquarium that is located in the lobby. Check out the pictures in the hotel description as words will not do it justice!!!

<Content>Loved it We stayed at the SAS Radisson Berlin over half term with our Children aged 10 and 13. Originally had two rooms facing outside as the ones facing the tank are not interconnecting. We were so taken with the Aquarium we asked to move so we could have Aquarium views and the hotel happily moved us to two rooms next door to each other. Good move. It was very peaceful watching the fish and we enjoyed watching the divers feed the fish and clean the tank each morning from about 8am. Hotel lovely spotless. Breakfast superb lots of choice.Good location for sightseeing.We enjoyed a trip on the river spree. If you fancy this option use the boat next to the hotel breakfast room. It was in english and very interesting. We also went on the bus tour which was good to see all the sights but the commentary was disjointed and dull. We visited the Legoland Discovery centre which is an indoor venue. It was good better for under 10's though.We liked eating outside at restaurants with heaters the other side of Hakkechermarkt oppsite to the Hagen Das. The food was nice.We also got reservations to eat at the tv tower's revolving restaurant via the concierge it's busy so worth asking a few days before. The night we went it was foggy but we still went . The Kids loved the fact the restauant revolved. The food was very basic. We were still eating the starters and the main courses arrived ! Without the fog the view would be great.We went on the Berlin Hi-Flyer (Welt-Balloon) one of the biggest helium balloons in the world. You silently ascend above the roofs of the capital to an altitude of 450 feet . The balloon is restrained by a cable attached to the ground. An electric motor pulls you back on the ground . The whole trip took about 20 mins and the view was great.Overall hotel fab would definately stay again. Berlin is an interesting destination for families lots to see and do.

<Content>Fantastic! Stayed in the Radisson SAS from Jan 23 - 26. Got a good deal on a BB basis through Alpha Rooms. Great location with good transport links.Check-in quick and efficient, all staff very pleasant and helpful. Fantasic hotel, immaculately clean with great care to fine detail. Excellent choice for breakfast from 'made to order' omelettes, full english or continental, all plentiful. Cannot comment on the restaurant meals and we ate out every evening. The main guests at the hotel were mainly business people and seemed to have a lot of conferences going on. As everyone mentiones in their reviews, stands an impressive aquarium in the lobby, which can also be seen from the balconies if you've been allocated within one of the courtyard type rooms. This incidentaly is an aquarium which belongs to the Sea Life next door. Entrance from the Sea Life itself will cost you 鈧?6pp, however if you ask one of the hotel staff they can get you in for only 鈧?1pp. If you're going to Berlin we would certainly recommend the Radisson.

<Content>Fantastic place This hotel is faultless if you are a normal person.We booked this after the one we had booked, The Grand Hotel Esplande, was having it's leisure facilities refurbished. The hotel didn't tell us about this we picked it up when we were looking at it on Expedia at the very last minute. So thanks for that Expedia!Anyway the hotel, having not been to Berlin before, I hadn't a clue what or where we were staying. Went on the reviews from this site as always, so here goes,Bad points - None, as in none at all.Good points - Staff - superb. Polite, helpful, etc etc. Spot on.Food - The Noodle Bar - Excellent. Didnt try the other, Heat or the bar so cannot comment. Also didn't try the breakfast.Bars - The bar in the atrium is brilliant especially with that aquarium above you! The Aqua Bar downstairs near the Noodle Bar is superb and very Chique. Cocktails are top notch , but they are E10 each on average, Long Island Iced Tea or the Mai Tai or for pure alcohol the St Pauli Killer.Gym - Brilliant. Went in three times, had it all to ourselves. Treadmills, x trainers, weights, bikes etc all in superb condition.Pool - Nice with counter current which is a right laugh till you get used to it.Sauna - Ace, three saunas and like has been said before, they are mixed and you can go in naked, but this explained on all the doors and in the changing rooms. The massage facilities etc looked nice as well but didnt use them.The hotel is within two minutes of the u bahn etc and the TV tower.For a top steak go out of the hotel turn left, and within 100 yards on the left there is a nice restaurant called Block House. Opposite the hotel to the left across the park is a bowling alley, once again this is a nice place not some seedy joint.The rooms - nice, spotless, with everything you need apart from an iron which is available on request.Radisson Berlin - superb. Would stay here again without a doubt. The staff were superb as was everything else.

<Content>The Best Location in town and that aquarium! As soon as you enter this hotel the spectacular aquarium towering above the reception and up towards the roof hits you between the eyes. The hotel is stunning in appearance, the rooms are above average - you should be asked for either an internal view of the aquarium or an outside view. If you want an outside view avoids one that overlooks next doors' mall and seek a river of front view.The best thing about this hotel however is the location. It lies on the river at the end of the main tjhoroughfare Unten Den Linden. Within 5 minutes walk you have two lively pub and bar areas and you are 20 minutes walking distance of the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie and a mere 5 minutes fron the giant TV Tower.For good eating and drinking turn head for the otherside of Hakkechermarkt and the miriad of restaurants and bars serving the student area. Oranienburgerstrasse is the main bar street and try the bar Assel. The food is good and the bar atmospheric. Further up Oranienburgerstrasse is a restaurant called simply the Oranien. The food there is especially good - try the Goulashsuppe - to die for.Alternatively walk across the park opposite the hotel to the Nikolaiviertal area and tucked away next to the old Chuch behind the first street you will find a superb pub called the Zum Nussbaum. This is a gem of an old inn and the visit is well worth it.The hotel does have its own restaurant and noodle bar but get out and explore.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Good Location I stayed at this Hotel based both on these reviews and the fact that I have used this chain before. The hotel is iimpressive in every sense, there is simply nothing to fault. Only a tiny moan is that some rooms do not have a view - and they are overlookedby offices - but if you are in Berlin you should not be in your room anyway.The Aquadome is fantastic as are the rooms. The staff without exception were truly great. The hotel is about 5 minutes from nearest U-ban Station, 5 minutes to Dom or TV Tower.Also there are really interesting shops closeby.I would certainly stay here again when I next visit Berlin.

<Content>Good service in restaurant, great location Stayed for three nights. At the bar the burger was a little bit less warm than expected, but still eaten by me. I didn't complain but gave feedback because they've asked for it - They did not charge it! Very nice! Lobby is a little bit cool like a railway station, not good if you expect to sit there for a time to read a book etc.Rooms seem to depend, wether you have a few outside or inside, which could be a little bit depressing I think.

<Content>Excellent hotel This place looked too good to be true when I booked it but reality was everything I'd hoped for. It's a totally nice, modern, clean, and efficient hotel in a superb location. The hotel has a huge atrium with what's basically a massive fish tank that rises up from over the bar to the roof. The reception was very fast and friendly ans we were quickly on our way to our room. All the public areas were absolutely spotless and had the appearance of a brand new hotel that had just been created for a style magazine photoshoot. The rooms were a good size and again very modern and sleek in style - a good sized LCD TV, nice furniture, very effective a/c, tea/coffee maker, wireless access, plenty of desk space and a massive bed. Everything was shiny and spotless. The bathroom was also superb if a little on the small side - definitely a one person at a time bathroom.Prices in the bar were very good - especially coming from the UK - and the happy hour was a fantastic deal. We ate at the Noodle Bar and it too was great value for money. I don't like eating breakfast in hotels and there were plenty of nearby alternatives.All the staff we dealt with were friendly, helpful, and efficient.The location of the hotel was perfect. Close to just about all the main sightseeing places and a pleasant walk, or cheap taxi ride, through the parks to KaDeWe and all the main shopping areas.Next time I'm in Berlin this hotel will be top of my list.

<Content>Decent choice - but a few bugs in the service I had expected more from this hotel. It is well situated and has an impressive lobby, but the room was a little small with a tiny bathroom. When I returned my main course in the restaurant because it was unacceptable (lobster the size of a prawn), they still expected me to pay for it. Had to talk to the manager to sort that out. Also upon check-out, they got the costs of my stay wrong, trying to charge me 鈧?00 more then Radisson reservations had booked the room at. Luckily I had a printout of my confirmation. The lobby staff where not all that helpful, they couldn鈥檛 tell me how to turn out an annoying light in my room, or the cost of the movie service. All in all not the usual Radisson service. Have to note though that the doorman was VERY HELPFUL.

<Content>Excellent hotel, location and value I have lived in Berlin for 18 months and have passed the bland facade many times, noting only its prime location on the banks of the Spree, across from the Berliner Dom. I had never considered staying there (I have had to stay in hotels in between long-term apartments) until I read the reviews here and found a great rate.Wow! What a gem, especially for tourists.I stayed ina Business Class room for 159 EUR. The upgrade from 119 got me free internet access, free pay movies, bathrobe and slippers, free newspaper, prime Dom view, Nespresso maker, and an iron and pants press. You'd have to make the call yourself.At the lower rate, in particular, the hotel represents outstanding value. Non-suite rooms are 27 sq m (standard and business are the same) and don't feel crowded at all, thanks to very clever room design.The shower is a bath/shower combination. If you need a walk in, you might want to double check.Had dinner at hEat, described as Fusion. I stuck to the Indian submenu, which was high-quality, but underspiced (i.e., mainstream), with a limited menu. Great service, though, and reasonable prices.The lobby is dominated by the huge aquarium rising through the center, which (as long as you never consider what might happen if it breaks) is a fun change from the norm. It does bring a lot of tourists off the street who just want a peek, rather than paying admission around the corner to ride up the center of the aquarium in a slow lift. Those crowds, however, are fully blocked off from the lobby, so noise is kept down.It is, however, a large hotel, so don't expect boutique charm and great people watching in the lobby.For a tourist, the location is outstanding. You are across the river from Museum Insel, and on the road that becomes Unter den Linden. (Tip: The 100 and 200 buses, which run across the city and provide a penny-pinching alternative to a city tour bus, stop right out front. If you want a quick shuttle along Unter den Linden -- stay, two stops to get to Friedrichstrasse -- ask for a kurzstrecke ticket from the bus driver. At 1.10 or 1.20 EUR, it's half the price of a normal AB ticket and lets you go six bus stops in one direction. Nice trick if you're feet are starting to give out).The hotel is also directly across from the Fernsehrturm (TV Tower) at Alexanderplatz, and an easy walk to Hackeschermarkt and the hipper areas of Mitte.In the other direction, Gendamenmarkt is also an easy walk. There are several good, upscale restaurants here including what I think is the original Lutter  Wegner and a very nice Italian restaurant Buca di Beppo.Underground parking with direct access by elevator from the lobby is available at normal parking garage rates (which aren't too bad in Berlin).

<Content>Great Location  I have stayed in several Radisson SAS Hotels (Paris, Amsterdam, Prague etc) and this one is defiantly near the top of the heap.I stayed in an well appointed King Junior Suite, with amazing views over the Berliner Dom, Museumsinsel (Museum Island)and the old East German Parliament building 'Palast der Republik or 'Palace of the Republic' (which, after many years, is finally being pulled down)The Hotel is modern, sleek and provides excellent modern amenities. The cylindrical aquarium that is in the lobby of the hotel is truly amazing and can be viewed from the elevator as you are travelling to your floor.The Hotel is well located on the River Spree and is close to Hackescher Markt and the adjoining S Bahn, which runs all the ways out to Flughafen Schonefeld (Airport) on the S9 Line. There are also some great restaurants in the Hackescher Markt area.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is considering staying in Berlin, whether for business or Leisure.

<Content>Excellent Time - but what was the time?! Beautiful hotel, excellent service, modern amenities. Loved it. The most important feature is definitely the cylindrical aquarium that is in the lobby of the hotel that one can view from the elevator that travels inside it. My only complaint - there was no clock in the room so I never knew what time it was and the alarm feature on the phone was ok but if reset it (can you say 'snooze-aholic') it didn't seem to work again that day!!! Very frustrating.

We had a wonderful time, a very high quality hotel, with very friendly and efficent staff. We stayed in a Business class room, and it was well worth the extra charge, we had a beautiful view of the river and the dome, the breakfast was second to none!

The location is very good, basically next to the Unter den Linden street leading to the Brandenburger gate (20 min walk down Unter den Linden).

<Content>great location positives--hotel was modern and clean. staff was very nice, spoke english, and were generally helpful. location is fabulous. we walked everywhere. close to all the sites around mitte. plenty of restaurants, museums, and shops. we are walkers, but the cathedral is literally next door, and it was maybe a 15 minute walk to the brandenburg gate with many attractions along the way. the hotel itself has an attraction in it (an aquarium), and the tour buses all stop either at the hotel or next door at the cathedral. negatives--we asked if breakfast was included after we had checked in and the person on the phone said yes. upon checkout we were charged 22euro a person for breakfast. my friend had been sick, and some mornings she just had coffee. they would not take off the charges. also, the shower/tub is a bit high to step into and the hairdryer would not blow hot air. that being said, if i ever went back to berlin, i would definitely stay here. i just would not eat the breakfast.

<Content>Excellent hotel - great location The two of us spent an extended weekend here. We're both seasoned travellers and used to both high and low-end locations and we both agreed that this hotel scored very high on all counts. First of all it's location in the center of Berlin, in the former East Berlin, right off Unter Den Linden, near transport, walkning distance from museums and great restaurants we super and ensured we didn't waste time on transport. Secondly the staff - especially the concierge - was very helpful and knowledgable providing us with good service. The rooms we're right out of an issue of Wallpaper - only the pillows were not 100% but still ok. Finally - but not least - the breakfast buffet is one of the best any of us have ever had in a hotel. We can therefore highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Berlin.

Soap was never replaced during my 5 day stay (they were too small to begin with and I only received one small one for bath and sink). It was a huge struggle to get a nice room, rooms were in need of repair. Not a 5 star hotel in any way.Would not stay again.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Radisson. We booked this hotel for my husbands birthday based on previous reviews and we were not disappointed.The hotel was modern, clean with excellent service. The soundproofing was good so we couldnt hear noise from other rooms or from the outside. We had a standard room which didnt have a dressing gown or slippers which is surprising for a 5* hotel. The business class rooms had those.The breakfast which we managed to get included in our rate was great also. At the weekend breakfast is served in the lobby which has the huge aquarium to look at.The pool looked quite small though we never used it.Many of the sites of East Berlin are within walking distance and the hop on/off tour bus goes from nearly outside the hotel. The 100/200 buses go from nearby and they take you most of the tourist places for 2.10 Euros per trip though there is a 5.80 Euro day ticket available. As a previous reviewer said its not near the main shops in the west of the city (which are excellent ) but the100/200 buses both take you right there. The River Spree runs nearby the hotel and there are boat trips available there as another means of seeing the sites.We used the noodle bar twice-the first time better than the second.Berlin is an interesting city and though we had very wet weather we would go back again and certainly to this hotel

<Content>Very Good Option Spent two days at this modern hotel. It's in a great, convenient location, right behind Berliner Dom in Alexander Platz. This makes it easy to walk into all of Mitte, to restaurants around Hackescher Markt and to the metro at AlexanderPlatz. The room was very stylish, with a particularly good shower, and relatively spacious. The only two negatives are the bed and the lack of iron. The bed is two beds pushed together. So, if they are two of you, the beds are likely to seperate. They also feel kind of like an air matress. The room had a trouser press, but that's not much help for wrinkled shirts. The wine and champagne glasses, and the porcelain cups are other nice touches. Overall, highly recommened.

<Content>Absolutely top notch We splurged and reserved a corner suite at the unbeateable rate of 350 euros (included breakfast). To say that we were delighted is an understatement. The room itself was very well designed, with a comfortable sitting area, huge bathroom with double sinks, separate tub and good-sized shower, and floor to ceiling windows on two walls. Housekeeping was flawless. We happened to be wallowing in the wonderfulness of our room one morning when a woman came specifically to tend to our espresso machine. She spent at least five minutes cleaning it! No wonder the coffee was so delicious!Staff was without fail pleasant. The lobby was stunning, with a huge aquarium in the center. Even if you don't stay here, you should at least check out the lobby. Unlike previous reviewers, we weren't so excited about Noodles, but the breakfast buffet was awesome. This is probably the only time I've stayed at a hotel where I felt the breakfast buffet was worth the high charge (as mentioned above, it was inluded in our room rate).The location was pretty good, depending what you want to do and how much walking you're up for. It is a bit of a walk to the subway, which is an efficient way to get around this sprawling city.Highly recommended!!

<Content>a Tripadvisor Member from Holland (59 years of age) We stayed 6 nights in Radisson Sas. It was during the IFA-exibition. That's why we paid about euro 200/night for a standardroom. Too much, althought it's a great hotel. The hotel is only 2-3 years old and is very good soundproof in the room. When you lock the window you almost don't hear anything (also not from the neighbours or from the corridor). We never had a more silent room. Also in September 2006 the airco in the room was still on, fresh and very quiet. The breakfast was great but too expensive (euro 22/p.p.). From the hotel almost everything in Berlin is in walking-distance.The hotel is in the new center of Berlin (=Mitte). The traffic is rather quiet for a big city. You can easily rent and use a bike. A day-visit to Potsdam (with the S-bahn) is a must.A stay in this beautifull hotel is advisable.

<Content>Perhaps the top hotel in the Radisson SAS line! Berlin is a big city - bigger than you think. So, my only caveat is about location: this hotel is nowhere near the great Ku'Damm shopping area. It's also a decent taxi ride from the main train station, the haubtbahnhof. Location issues aside, this is a wonderful, but VERY Scandinavian, hotel. I love Scandinavia and this type of fairly minimalist design hotel. I have stayed at many Radisson SAS hotels and none are as nice as this. Be warned, though, that this hotel is like very high-end Ikea. If you like older hotels, big heavy furniture and grand ballrooms stay elsewhere. Now all of the great stuff about this hotel: everything, really. Spa and gym are superb. Food is great. Staff is helpful and friendly. Room rates are much cheaper than they really should be. Rooms are clean - very clean. Room has a heated pants press, which is very useful (as I write this, I am wearing impeccably pressed - by me - wool dress pants). The water in the sink and shower is really hot and the water pressure superb. Small but nice plasma TV in the room - very good quality picture. So, from a weary world business traveler, this is a really good - exceptionally good - hotel. Do not hesitate to stay here.

<Content>wonderfully modern Recently stayed at this amazing property. Everything was top-notch. Ultra modern lobby with the obviously beautiful aquarium.Our business room was bright, modern, clean and came with a great view of the Berliner Dom and Spree river. Bathrooms were of decent size for Europe.Everyone was helpful and spoke perfect English.Breakfast was filling. Loved the scrambled eggs and the pots of coffee they left at the tables. No need to ask for re-fills.Ate one night at the Noodle Cafe. The food was good and not that pricey.Great location. You are within walking distance to most of Berlin's attractions and eateries. Great, up-and-coming neighborhoods nearby.Would def stay here again. In fact,planning on doing so soon.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - A tick in every box. We have just returned from a fabulous 4 night stay. The hotel is in an ideal setting for sight seeing, is extremely clean and the hotel staff cannot do enough to help/give you outstanding service. Nothing seems to be too much trouble.And the big plus point for us was how quiet the room was - this is something that is often overlooked in some hotels - not here, you don't hear a peep. They also play lovely relaxing music in the corridors - infact the whole hotel has a calm, tranquil feel to it.We didn't have breakfast included in the price and only stayed for this once - it was very good but we chose to spend our 22 euros each in other ways and just grabbed a cofffee/filled croissant from the cafe next door - fine.The spa/pool area is also very good - again, clean, calming and it smelt wonderful!! We had a meal at Noodle - one of their restaurants - fantastic - proper, authentic chinese/thai cooking. Wished we had tried Heat as well, their other restaurant - this always looked busy.Overall, this would be the place I would stay at again when visiting Berlin - they jusy got it right on everything. Well Done!!

<Content>Brilliant Hotel We stayed for 4 nights and though we had booked the 99 euro a night deal, we took the upgrade to the business class room which was even still at a great price. The extras included a room facing the Dom with our own balcony(great place to sit in the evening having a coffee or glass of wine while watching the boats drift by on the Spree), full buffet breakfast, espresso machine, free pay-tv, bathrobes and upgraded toiletries. Worth every penny!The hotel is in a great location and close to all major sites - we walked a lot but also got a great value 'day ticket' and used the buses and trains a lot also as Berlin is bigger than expected. The hotel itself is fantastic and the 'fish tank' just caps off the experience - we found the room to be a good size and well maintained and clean - staff were friendly and helpful - the breakfast kept us going until at least 3pm every day. Also the room had to be one of the quietest we've ever stayed in - we didn't realise how good the soundproofing was until I opened the balcony doors one morning early and was greeted by very loud building site noises...not even a whisper when the doors were closed and never once did we hear a sound from the corridor. We flew into Schonefeld airport and got the S9 train to Hackescher Markt for 2.10 each. The station was less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel and easy to find. Overall we found Berlin great value and very cheap to eat out in - you can literally buy food on the street for a euro or 2 and at night can eat out very cheaply even in the better restaurants. We plan on returning to Berlin sometime in the future and will defitnetly be booking the Radisson again.

<Content>5* luxury at 2* prices we stayed 3 nights on the 99 euro per night deal ,this must be the best value deal around, excellent well equipped rooms ,courteous staff and spectacular building.OK, the breakfast is a ridiculous price but you don't have to have it, If you stay there take a walk across the park directly in front of the hotel on the other side is a picturesque area of cobbled streets with restaurants and pubs next to the river.

<Content>great place - would definitely stay there again We really enjoyed staying here. The rate on the Radisson website was very good, though the price of breakfast was high and that did increase the cost substantially. However, the breakfast really is excellent.The room is very attractively decorated, bathroom is nice, lobby is fantastic with the aquarium. We were on the street side but the sound insulation was excellent - didn't hear a thing.One tip: Alexanderplatz, the closest U-Bahn is a longish walk away (10-15 minutes) and is a big construction site. But buses 100 and 200 stop near the hotel, are very frequent, and take you to most of the interesting places in the city centre. Alternatively, walk to Hackescher Markt (around 5 minutes) and take the S-Bahn from there. We ate in the noodle restaurant at the hotel one day for lunch and it was fantastic.Staff here were helpful and everything just seemed perfect.Gym is also good.

This hotel is in a very good location.The hotel is next to the river Spree where you can get the riverboats.A tour bus stops outside the hotel and you can buy the tickets there,bit cheaper than the hotel.I found all the main tourist spots to be quite central. The hotel is clean and modern and very good.We did not have to interact with the staff much but they were excellent.Overall an excellent cheap hotel in an excellent location no matter where you want to go. I found Berlin to be very cheap.

<Content>The inside aquarium really is as cool as it looks in the pictures I was just so enamored of that aquarium, it was completely extraordinary. We made sure to get a room facing it, so we could enjoy it and I'm so glad we did. The scuba divers were in there every morning cleaning it up and it was just really something for me to be able to see that just out my hotel room window. One of my favorite things on our vacation. The rooms were great as well, not huge, but plenty big enough. The design of the bar area downstairs around the aquarium and of the restaurants themselves I thought was very eye catching and fantastically done. Shocking really for a chain hotel that really is not known for that sort of thing. Bravo there. And the sushi restaurant in particular we just loved. It was the ideal place and for a hotel restaurant it was sublime. The staff were a bit stuffy I have to say. The concierge did a great job in the end, but he acted like it was killing him to do it. I know I did ask a lot of questions and make many requests, but jeez he acted so very put out to have to deal with me. And I was always very nice, but got a lot of sighs and moans in return like it was all a huge chore. Oh well. I also had a massage in the spa and it was just great. And the spa itself was pristine and manned by very happy and helpful young ladies who seemed to have been spared the weight of the world attitude of the other staff. The breakfast was fantastic as well. Fresh waffles made to order and croisssants straight from the oven? I don't recall getting that anywhere else. Well done. Great location for the hotel as well next to the Berliner Dome and television tower. Impressive. And near to the subway as well. One strong recommendation there however. Whenever possible, especially when coming from the airport on the train with your bags, go to the Anhalter Bahnhof station and NOT the Alexanderplatz station (where we were directed). The area around Alexanderplatz is seedy and makes a horrible first impression of Berlin. And the walk is far shorter from Anhalter Bahnhof.We went on a cruise of the River Spree as part of the hotel package and it was very nice and relaxing and educational. And quite the way to see the city too. Other highlights: Just walking on the two main Berlin arteries, Unter den Linden and KuDam, along with shopping on Friedrichstrasse and the Potzdamer Platz gives you a great feel for the pulse of the city. The Reichstag and the Brandenburg gate are every bit as arresting as you've heard as well. And lesser discussed but as affected is the Holocaust Memorial near the Brandenburg Gate. It is supremely well done, disorienting once you are wandering inside it and sobering while also being serene, peaceful and lovely.

<Content>Mixed feelings about the Radisson An early morning flight from London and consequently arrived several hours before the official check in time, but we were provided with a room immediately. That was very welcome. We were offered an outside facing room or a room overlooking the huge cylindrical aquarium. We opted for an outside facing room, hoping for a great view of Berlin. Unfortunately we were given a room with an unimpressive outlook directly opposite an office building and a shopping arcade below. Nothing scenic at all. Disappointing. Our room was compact, however spotlessly clean and very quiet. We never heard a sound from the corridor or the adjacent rooms, ever. The d茅cor in the room is modern and 鈥榤inimalist鈥? Very nice. Flatscreen TV was smart, but a bit fuzzy. But we didn鈥檛 go to Berlin to watch telly, so it didn鈥檛 matter.We had dinner in the Noodle Kitchen. It was delicious and not expensive. We made a reservation and were provided with our own table by the window overlooking the Berliner Dom. The restaurant staff were extremely attentive. The bar staff (especially one) in the bar directly by the Noodle Kitchen were wonderful. The reception staff and concierge are rather snooty, however.We didn鈥檛 eat breakfast in the hotel (so overpriced 鈥?there are several delicious bakeries very close by where you can have superb traditional breakfasts for far better value). They鈥檙e pretty mean on the toiletries for a 鈥榝ive star鈥?hotel 鈥?little plastic capsules of fruity flavoured shampoo  shower gels 鈥?yummy 鈥?but why fill the trendy container up with only 6 or 7 when there鈥檚 room for 9? Sounds petty, but it really does come across as stingy. Lower star hotels we鈥檝e stayed in also offer razors, toothpaste, combs, etc鈥?there was nothing like that. Not that we ever really use them, but they鈥檙e nice touches and come in handy if needed. The bed was comfy, but our 鈥榙ouble bed鈥?was two singles pushed together 鈥?not very romantic 鈥?my husband found the gap in the middle very annoying.The Radisson is in the former east of the city and is well situated 鈥?U-Bahn, Alex  Hackescher Markt walking distance close by. The Berliner Dom is immediately opposite across the dark  still River Spree.The enormous aquarium is interesting. The fish seem well cared for as there were divers in the tank every morning swimming around maintaining the feature.I requested a platter of fruit and chocolates in our room and it was beautifully presented, and for 15 Euro well worth it. The hotel very kindly also provided a (free) birthday cake for my husband, which was lovely. I think what impressed us most about the Radisson Berlin is that, without asking, we were offered at checkout if we would like our luggage stored until we could come back later to collect our bags before our late flight home. Excellent.On Berlin 鈥?the transport system is incredibly efficient 鈥?and so cheap! Euro 2.10 on the trains 鈥?bargain! The streets are generally clean and we found the Berliners so friendly. Twice while we were in the middle of the street with a big map in our hands, locals spontaneously approached us with offers of help with directions. I tried to speak German in shops and cafes, but everyone just spoke back in English, and they were all full of information and eager to help us enjoy our stay. There were occasionally pockets of drunks around and street con artists on corners 鈥?but it鈥檚 a big city 鈥?it鈥檚 all part of it. Enjoy! Would we stay at the Radisson again? No. There鈥檚 competition from hotels in Berlin offering better value. Can see why this hotel appears to be slipping down the ladder of top hotels in Berlin on Tripadvisor. We visited the Kurfurstendamm and the Swissotel looked really inviting. Would probably stay there.

<Content>small rooms but great hotel I stayed here after staying in hotel concorde for my previous 2 visits and what a contrast!The concorde is modern, minimalist and understated with huge rooms and quiet. This hotel is much more lively and has an incredible reception area with the huge aquarium. Believe me it looks far larger and more impressive in real life than the photos. I booked under a deal at 68 pounds per room per night which is an absolute bargain. The restuarants in the hotel and bars are great and have a good atmoshphere. My only critisism is the rooms. While they are nicely done with flat plasma TV and great ensuite, fittings etc they are a little too small (im certainly glad i did not bring my 6 yr old daughter, there was no space for a bed for her in room). The location of the hotel is great for sightseeing around the old historic berlin. Recommended.

<Content>Berlin's Best Bargain We spent last night in the Berlin Radisson after spending the previous 5 nights in the touted Arcotel Velvet. The 5 star Radisson is actually less expensive than the much more modest 3 star Arcotel. I found a deal at the Radisson website for 99 euros per night if booked 5 days in advance. This included all taxes and fees. I couldn't believe it since we had walked in and asked for room rates at the front desk and were told 160 euros/per night. It's an amazing bargain at 99 since the hotel is simply luxurious and wonderfully situated. Our sixth floor room had a broad and stunning view and every amenity that one would possibly want or need including particularly comfortable beds, free 0800 calls (the Arcotel charged 2 euros for the same), free internet with one's own laptop (again the Arcotel added a high fee for internet in the room although their bar did have two free computers for guest use) and to top it off a free continental breakfast (unadvertised but yours for the taking with yummy croissants, pastries, unlimited tea, coffee and orange juice). The Arcotel only offered a full paid buffet breakfast. Suffice to say this is a wonderful hotel and a wonderful price and no, I'm not a Radisson p.r. person, just a guest from New Jersey who had a brief but outstanding stay.

<Content>Snazzy, yes - smug, too Previous reviews have established the smart, modern and clever design. The rooms and publics areas are mod but not quite severe. Stayed five days but it took the first full day to figure out how to operate certain things in the room. Slept very well. The carpets in the hallway were torn out and pieces of equipment left sitting about, with no explanation.The breakfast buffet was simply outstanding. It was lovely to enjoy the view of the Berliner Dom and Spree with the excellent food. Dinner one evening was good (if minimalist) and pricey.You can catch the bus outside the front door or walk a couple of blocks around the corner to the S-Bahn. I gave an above average rating because of the spotless, peaceful and comfortable room, striking designs, and A+ breakfast. I can't give an outstanding rating because the front desk staff, concierge, and even the doormen had such a condescending, smug attitude. They all seemed quite pained to provide the basics. The restaurant service was better and much more welcoming.

<Content>fine location The location is excellent, as most of attractions are within walking distance, in particular the Museum island. The hotel is adjacent to Alexanderplatz, about 500 m from the underground station so you will have a smooth access to the rest of the city. The staff is nice and the rooms are very functional. The Aquadome is cool, but sooner or later you get tired of waking up surrounded by fishes already early in the morning (btw you will find some of these fishes in the 6th floor of KaDeWe!). I regret the swimming pool is a bit small.For the breakfast you will find 2 or 3 good cafeterias around the hotel. A hint for the dinner: excellent and huge italian pizza in the passage just outside the hotel (italian quality and german quantity), every Friday unlimted chinese food for less than 8 EUR.

<Content>Great Location After a three night stay I agree with much that has been said in previous reviews. The hotel is ultra modern with every facility and in a superb location. As a tourist and business hotel it rates well.However the design of the fittings in the rooms will inevitably lead to wear and tear and so it may be a matter of luck as to how perfect one's room is or not. Our meal in the HEAT restaurant was very poor but we fared better in the Noodle bar. Breakfast had a huge selection but I felt that the quality was a bit mediocre - but then that's what mass catering is about I suppose. Also the breakfast area was overwhelmed with business conference people when we we there, making it a bit of a scrumFantastically helpful doorman (the one with the handlebar moustache)We have stayed in nicer hotels but it fitted the bill for a busy visit to Berlin due to the range of facilities and its location.

<Content>Loved the AquaDome We stayed at the Radisson SAS for 2 nights in March 2006. After reading reviews and looking at the website, we decided to treat ourselves to a Junior Suite.We asked for a high floor with a city view and what a view when we walked into the 5th floor room! The suites are at the corners of the building so we had 2 external walls and both were floor to ceiling glass.We looked across the River Spree at the Berliner Dom cathedral and the start of Unter den Linden.The central atrium of the hotel is sooooo spectacular with the huge aquarium dominating everything.Being only 2 years old everything is new and very stylish in a modernist way.Service is very good but breakfast, at 22 Euros if it is not included in the price, is not worth it. There is Andy's restaurant  bar left out of the hotel.River sightseeing boats leave every hour from justy outside the hotel as do the yellow sightseeing buses, turn left and go about 200 metres to the yellow bear.The Brandenburg gate is 25 minutes walk and the Richstag 15 minutes.Recommended

<Content>Service not up to expectations, room a little worn I stayed at the Radisson Berlin for two nights and found the location perfect for business in the center of Berlin. The design is certainly spectacular in a very modern sense. There were two aspects which I found rather disappointing: The room had a slightly worn look, with chipped edges of the modern interior, marks on the walls and bathroom fittings which just had this worn feel about it, giving it all a somewhat cheap appearance. The design is smart and elegant, but not really practical.It was obvious that, walking with a stick, some help with my luggage would have been useful for me. Neither at arrival, nor at departure, was there anyone present who was able or prepared to help from and to the taxi. The service, and the attitude of the personell I had contact with was rather cool and certainly not forthcoming and helpful - not at all the level of service you expect in the class of hotel the Radisson claims to be.I did not feel particularly welcome, and will not stay at the Radisson again.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel We stayed here on business for 3 nights, and I loved everything about this place, except for the restaurant Heat, which had a funny smell, and a really un appetizing menu, although noodles in the basement (lower area) was great.Rooms are comfortable, but surprisingly did not have down pillows, nor robes. Other than this, we loved it, oh, one other drawback is that you are in fact in East Berlin, so if you are planning on any major shopping in the west you are a good 20min. train ride from KaDeWe etc. keep this in mind when booking, but for the rate worth every penny.

<Content>Excellent hotel in the best of locations This was our second time in Berlin and having stayed in Hackesche Markt last time we already knew the area was excellent in terms of access to transport and all the sights. By booking early we got a good deal at 120 Euros per night - a standard room plus access to the spa. Staff were excellent and the room very modern, spotlessly clean, a good size and very comfortable - even had coffee  tea making facilities which is unusual for a continental hotel. Our room was on the first floor, overlooking a small arcade with gift shops and restaurants (good Italian) which was fine. In the summer it might be worth asking for a floor higher up but given the double glazing and air conditioning all rooms should be quiet. The spa area was spotlessly clean and although the pool is not very big there are 2 large saunas, a steam room, aromatherapy room etc. We didn't bother with breakfast - there are coffee shops close by if you prefer smaller breakfasts. An excellent hotel - can't agree at all with the previous (negative) review.

<Content>OK but with some minuses When we presented our pre-paid reservation through Expedia at the check-in desk, we were told that it wasn't registered. We had to make an expensive call on our cellphone to the booking agency in Norway to get a confirmation that everything should be ok, and that we should point out the booking code on our print-out. The check-in man then rang the hotel's reservation office and it turned out they had apparently forgot to forward our reservation internally. When we pointed out in so many words that this was something he ought to have checked out before turning us away and forcing us to make a 15euro call back home, he gave us free tickets to the Aqua land as a compensation. Never got the chance to use them though, preferring to spend our limited time on Berlin's many fascinating museums.Our room was a standard size business room, with a nice view towards a park and the Nikolaikirche. It was extremely well insulated against noise; a very important point since the street in front of the hotel is heavily trafficked at most times. In addition, just a stonethrow away, The Palast der Republik was in the process of being torn down. This was very noisy indeed, but with the window closed we heard practically nothing. On the other hand, there was a very tiresome muzac constantly being piped in the corridors. Made you practically run to and from the elevator to get away from it as fast as possible.Breakfast was not included in our Expedia booking, and we thought it was inordinately expensive. But no problem; there were plenty of opportunities for a very good and inexpensive breakfast within a couple of minutes on foot from the hotel entrance.The bathroom was very stylish in appereance, but at closer look, several design solutions were just very awkward. For one thing, the wash basin was a porcellain bowl placed on a wooden top. Absolutely a feast for the eye when new. But because of the constant spilling of water from handwashing etc, the wood was now cracking up and appearing very worn. Furthermore, the glass half-wall glued to the bathtub was inadequate when showering, with lots of water on the floor as a result. On the other hand, this inflexible halfwall must be a major obstacle for the room ladies when they're cleaning the upper part of the tub. A full-length shower curtain would've been a much better option. And then there was the awkward design of a single swingdoor functioning alternatively for the separate toilet cubicle and the rest of the bathroom. This door wasn't even full-length, so it must be a real problem for American couples with their hang-ups about bodily sounds when on the toilet. But to end on a more positive note: A plus for the flatscreen TV with many international channels, for the in-room coffee- and teamaking equipment, and, last but certainly not least, for very good beds.

<Content>Perfect Location The location is perfect, just across from museum island. We had the perfect view from our room of the Berlin cathedral and enjoyed the easy transportation with the bus and train systems nearby. We were even able to join a walking tour that started and ended just a few steps away. Staff was friendly and spoke English. Near several restaurants and even a McDonald's for the not so brave. We loved the modern touches in the room, like flat screen TV's and the shower soap was a welcome treat! We will absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for the best taste of Berlin.

<Content>AMAZING HOTEL, GREAT STAFF, GOOD LOCATION we booked 2 rooms at discounted rate of 99euro room only at the hotel, through the Radisson website. When we arrived we were impressed by the styling of the hotel and also the architecture. Staff were attentive as soon as we walked through the doors and we were able to check in for both rooms at 10:30am.Rooms are normally priced at 140Euro so we had already got a pretty good deal! The guy on reception offered us an upgrade into a business class room with a view of the city, free pay per view movies, breakfast etc. His no pressure sales pitch (at an extra 50euro per room, per night) talked us into the deal and we weren't disappointed!We had dinner in the Noodle bar on the Saturday night and it was pretty tasty. The staff were lovely (especially Angela who was able to reccommend a few bars on the town for the Sunday night) and we stayed in the hotel for a few drinks that evening.The hotel is well located and within walking distance from the Museum area and other areas of interest although when we headed out on the Sunday night we took a taxi as the area where the hotel is located is a little quiet.We also reccommend the Peugeot garage/restaurant (sounds strange, i know) for breakfast or lunch- yum yum. We were also impressed at how cheap Berlin was, for a large established city.

<Content>Shakey start, good recovery Initially, we were very disappointed because we arrived ~ 11:30 PM (with guarantee, because we had paid in advance), and the hotel had given our room away. They told us they were totally booked, so we had no room. We were furious! Fortunately, they arranged for a room for us at the Ritz the first night (I believe that's what it was), which was actually a nicer hotel. The subsequent nights, we were given a junior suite.So, all-in-all, the experience was a good one. The hotel is very modern, and in a wonderful location (right next to the Basilica). We enjoyed our stay very much!

<Content>Would Happily Reccomend to Anyone My Fiance and I have just returned from having spent Christmas at the Radisson in Berlin.Overall, we were very happy with the hotel, with the facilities, the courteous, always helpful staff, the standard of the rooms - almost everything. We went to Berlin and chose this particular hotel to get away from all the usual at home Christmas things and so far as this is concerned, the hotel played a key part in us having a very good time.It is very well placed and easy to get anywhere, but if you dont want to be in the thick of the nightlife, you can also get relaxation, peace and quiet. The hotel is located about two miles behind where the Berlin wall used to be, so the area is not as built up and frantic as what used to be West Berlin, which suited us fine. Food and Drink: Breakfast was the best I have found in any hotel anywhere, full stop. Superb choices. The Noodle Restaurant was very enjoyable, great food, very good wines, excellent ambience. HEAT restauarant on the other hand may have fallen into the trap of starting to beleive its own hype; whilst the food is OK to Good, telling residents of the hotel that the restaurant is full when it plainly is not and they havent even checked is not a way to endear yourself to customers. The three bars and the Cigar room are excellent, very enjoyable and service is very good.Concierge services are what you would expect from a Radisson. I could not find any fault with the help we were given.Only other slight slip-up was with the cleaning of the room; on one occasion, we had brought up a nightcap from the Atrium bar and also had earlier in that day brought a bottle of Prosecco up as well; the following day, after the room had been cleaned, the glasses we had used were still in the room, unemptied and hadnt been taken away. But, as I mentioned I think this is a minor issue and didnt detract from the time we had there, which was very enjoyable. The photos that have been added by another reviewer are exactly what the hotel is like and are very reprasentative.I can certainly see us returning at some point to Berlin; we didnt really leave ourselves enough time to really get the full Berlin experience, but what we saw -the history, the culture, the people - definately made us beleive that we should go back sometime in 2006. Its almost certain we will stay at the Radisson again and we would both happily reccomend it to anyone. There just needs to be a tiny bit more attention to detail on certain aspects. Nine and a half out of ten in our book!

<Content>Would stay there again and again We spent 3 nights at the Radisson SAS in Berlin with an Ocean view ie of the mind blowing aquarium and really enjoyed our stay. The staff were fantastic, the room was plenty big enough and with Free WiFi made the stay just that much better. I'd absolutely recommend for travellers to stay in this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, friendly staff Arrived at the hotel around 11am. Reception staff were very friendly and told us that they could give us a room immediately but advised us to wait until later when a room with a view of the cathedral/river would be available. We agreed and collected our travel tickets (part of our weekend deal) and went off sight-seeing. When we returned the room was ready and was indeed worth waiting for. A bowl of fresh fruit was provided along with tea/coffee making facilities - all very useful. Breakfast was included and was of an excellent standard with lots of choices available and our evening meal, in the Heat restaurant, was great. We had drinks in the night club and found it fairly reasonable (for nightclub prices). We reported a problem with the tap in our bathroom and although there was no-one available to fix it we were offered another room but we decided to stay where we were.We found staff throughout the hotel friendly and helpful and the location is superb. This was our fourth city break this year and without doubt one of the best hotels we have stayed in. I would thoroughly recommend it.

<Content>Nice Building - Poor Service After a very promising reception, our room was disappointingly small for a hotel of this rating without any views. Not did it have any of the normal four-star features like tea-bags, biscuits, pillow chocolate etc. We had to ask for a bath robe. There was no bidet in the bathroom which had an awkward toilet cut-off door arrangement and they seemed to be on a cost-cutting spree here too as they did not replace all the shampoos and soaps daily. On the third day our key would not work and we had to traipse all the way back to reception to be told that our three day booking had mistakenly been entered as two days - for this they did not apologise - and we then were locked out of our room for a further forty minutes while they cleaned the room which they had not bothered to do earlier bacause of the check-in mix-up.The spectalular fish tank in the foyer cannot be entered via the hotel- you have to go around several streets to enter it - at a fee. All in all this hotel should be classified three star and they should send the staff on a training course in customer relations. Never again!

<Content>Fab hotel, Fab place Both myself and my partner stayed in this hotel for my birthday at the end of August this year. We were extremely pleased with the hotel and its many services. Its is definately 5 star standards and how can you fail to be overwhelmed by the HUGE tropical fish tank in the centre. Staff were lovely and very friendly and we would loved to have stayed longer than our 3 nights. Used the spa facilities and ate at the Noodle Kitchen (hotel restuarant) 2/3 nights as it was fantastic. Would definately go back to Berlin as its a really chilled place and would have to stay at this hotel again. Go NOW!!!!

<Content>Lovely Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend at the start of October. The hotel was really lovely, very modern and extremely central. The food in the Noodle Kitchen restaurant was delicious for dinner. The reception area centres around the huge aquadome which is a definite talking point! We would definately recommedn this hotel for anyone looking for a nice break in the heart of Berlin.

<Content>Wonderful views overlooking the River Spree Stayed 4 nights here in a Junior suite. Wonderful views overlooking the River Spree and the Berlin Dome. We checked in early and had a late checkout, which extended our stay by half a day. Breakfast was superb, excellent weather enabled us to eat outside every day and evening, quite a romantic setting,service was excellent. The iced coffee and cakes were yummy. Quality of the food was excellent and not overpriced.Easy access to all place of interest and you can catch a bus from the Airport to the Hotel. Daily bus tickets available from the conceierge, much cheaper than going on the guided tour bus. You can buy a map that tells you what number bus to catch to all major places of interest. Bus service in Berlin is fantastic and prompt.We normally stay on the other side of Berlin near the Ka De Wa, but the Radisson is something else, the setting on the River Spree makes it more relaxing. The Spa swimming pool is on the small side, but we stayed mid week, so it was empty each time we used it. We will definitely stay here again. Most enjoyable stay and the staff very friendly and helpful, extra pillows etc brought straight away.A very relaxing Hotel, upmarket without being formal.

<Content>Superb standard We got a deal at this hotel which included breakfast, dinner one night, a boat trip and 48 hour travel passses. The breakfast was amazing. I've never seen a joint of pork on a breakfast buffet before.The overall standard was superb. There was a problem with our shower head, but a mechanic was there to fix it within 10 minutes. The Heat Restaurant was a bit dull and soulless for an evening meal and the service was a bit Teutonic. The bus pass was great because the 100 bus which goes along the Unter den Linden to the Brandenburg Gate stopped 200 yards from the hotel. The only difficulty we had was in trying to claim our boat trip. The concierge had no record of it on the Computer and it took a discussion with management to acknowledge our computer print-out showing details of our package. Our impression is that they have so many different deals they are unable to keep track of them. Nevertheless we would definitely stay there again. The location is ideal.

<Content>Great hotel, great location My wife and I stayed here in September, 2005, and were extremely impressed by all aspects of the hotel. It is extremely well located in that it is situated very close to many major sites. The area feels very safe and we regularly saw unaccompanied men and women out for a late evening stroll.The foyer is dominated by the Aquadome and the whole reception area is very attractive. Our room was excellent, both spotless and spacious. The staff were always helpful and friendly and I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great for Business and Pleasure Stayed 2 nights at the Radisson SAS Berlin on a business trip to a trade show.Location is great -at the end of the Unter de Linden - both for tourists and for access for Business.Lobby is unique with the Aquarium,elevators are clear so u float up face to face with the fish.Service is typically German - no warmth but very efficient - I asked house keeping for extra hangers,concierge kept packages and messages for me etc.Breakfast buffet whilst adequate is certainly not outstanding and they could consider delivering a newspaper to the room.Room is very modern and relatively spacious with a 26 Philips LCD TV adding a touch of class.Bathroom had 6 flavours of soaps and shampoos - again ,a nice extra touch.Access to the floors is only via room key in the elevator which adds security but is awkward if you have visitors as you have to come down to the lobby to pick them up.All in all a very satisfactory hotel which I would not hesitate to use again.I paid 140 Euro per night inc breakfast.

<Content>Small rooms, crowded breakfast and pool area... The Radisson SAS Berlin is a modern hotel with a kind of minimalist design. The lobby is beautiful and surprising with the huge aqurium above the bar, but unfortunately there are not enough armchairs of sofas for relaxing.There seem to be a lot of groups and families, and the breakfast is served only till 10.30, so the staff at the breakfast room cannot really make it. If you arrive around 10.00, it's hard to find a table and nobody has time to help you.The big disappointment for me was the sauna and pool area.The locker/dressing room is ridiculously small and the lockers are tiny.There were families with children screaming and running around, leaving their slippers and towels around the locker room and shower area. It's a big hotel (428 rooms if I'm not mistaken) and the pool is absolutely too small for this size of an establishment. The kids should not be allowed to use the pool without their parents. It's simply impossible to swim in a small pool full of screaming kids. My experience was far from relaxing. Many of the adults didn't even take a shower before entering the pool.There was a charming and friendly lady in charge of the sauna and pool area, but she didn't seem to notice the problems.They could reserve the sauna and pool to adults only.The fitness was only a tiny room with very little equipment.All in all, the Radisson SAS was an average experience. I would recommend Hotel Sofitel Gendarmenmarkt or Swissotel (both are new and very stylish) instead of Radisson.

<Content>Beautiful hotel in a great location This is a very large, new hotel in a great location for seeing the sights of Berlin. It is directly across the river Spree from the Berliner Dom (Cathederal) and museum island. There are both u-bahn and s-bahn stops within a couple blocks and the bus to Tegel airport stops a block away. The aquarium in the center of the lobby is a bit of a gimick, but the hotel is done in a very nice minimalist / modern theme. The rooms are nicely decorated with big windows.

<Content>Perfect Location with Radisson SAS This hotel is perfectly located for all the sites in East Berlin. We very easily took the TXL bus (which stops 200 meters from the front door) to and from the Tegel Airport. The staff was courteous and friendly, fluent in English, and excellent at providing directions. We had a great view of Museum Island and the Berlin Cathedral out our balcony. Also, I must say the ammenities smelled fantastic!

<Content>Great Hotel Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.Arrived at hotel early in the morning after early flight from UK, did not really expect to be able to check in to room, but the check in staff sat us down in the reception and provided us with a cafe latte's. This gave us the opportunity to admire the fish tank in the reception area and take in the wonderful ambience. I am not always a fan of modern design but this is an example of where it really works.20 minutes later we were in the room!We had a wonderful room on the 5th floor with a magnificent view of the river spree and Berliner dome.Hotel is well located for sightseeing.We stayed on a Berlin cruise package which was good value at 398 euros for two nights, river cruise, 2 day rail pass and one night meal in restaurant.Very nice restaurant.The hotel has a lovely pool leisure facilities and the staff are really helpful and friendly.This hotel puts London hotels to shame for price ,quality and service!

<Content>Okay but not as good as the Westin Brand!!!! We stayed at the Raddison SAS on the May Bank Holiday weekend for 3 nights and the weather was fantastic (although possibly a little too hot 30潞c+++). We went for our Anniversary with our 13 year old daughter and friends who also had a 13 year old and 5 year old daughters. This hotel is nice, but not as good as the Westin Grand. Checking in was a chore and we had to wait over an hour for our room, which in the meantime we were offered complimentary drinks at the bar (thus wasting valuable time). The room was clean and modern and we were lucky enough to be over looking the Aqua Dome.The staff I thought were a little off-hand and sometimes rude. The breakfast choice was limited especially on the first day when we had to eat out in the lobby due the hotel being full. The second two mornings we got to eat in the main restaurant and it was a little better (although no where near as good as the choice in the Westin Grand). The staff were very slow to clear our tables of used or unwanted items and appeared to look down their noses at us. We appeared to be the only families staying at this particular time with children, though all three girls were polite and well behaved!I was bitterly disappointed with the leisure facilities, I was really looking forward to going for a swim, but the pool is tiny! Three people swimming in it and it appears full so I didn鈥檛 bother. Once again the Westin wins hands down here.The location is fabulous, with loads of things to see and do within walking distance.

<Content>Good but not great I was stayed here from the 27th -the 31st of May. There are many positive things about the hotel. The location is wonderful. You are next to the Berlin Dom, the sea life center and the spree river. All other major attraction is about 15mins away. You can take the 100  200 buses which stop a block away from the hotel or just walk. The S-ban  The U-ban are also very close. This is a great starting point to explore the both east  West Berlin. The hotel staff is very fluent in English and very knowledgeable about the city and what鈥檚 going on. The rooms are very clean and up to date with there fixtures. I stayed in a business class room on the sixth floor. You have a bed, 2 night tables, a TV (flat screen), well stocked mini bar and a safe. The hot has two restaurants, a bar, and a gym. Breakfast is served till 11 in the heat restaurant. The have a large variety of food which was great but if this is not included in your hotel package stay away. Its 25Euros per person other wise. A few things made my experience here good but not great. The lobby smelled. I think this was because of the spree river but there is a rotten egg smell that takes over at times. The smell never made it pass the lobby though so the room smelled fine. Though clean the rooms are a bit bare, they were a bit cold to me (some may like this). My bed was supposed to be a king but it was two twins put together. If you rolled you would fall through the cracks. There was no universal adapter in the room. They did provide me with one when I ask but in a 5* hotel I expected one to be there. Lastly housekeeping came to the rooms as early as 7:30. To solve this problem I put the Do Not Disturb sign up till I left the room in the mornings.

<Content>Air conditioned splendor on Under den Linden While I was participating in a business meeting in Berlin in late May, the weather turned increasingly hot. Since Berlin is usually humid and since few facilities in the city are air-conditioned, I was lucky to be a guest in this very modern, comfortable, and air-conditioned hotel. Its standard rooms are not necessarily large, though they are very well appointed and (at least on the side facing an alley) quiet. The 5-story lobby acquarium is a fascinating touch, which residents of the hotel can gaze at as they ascend to their rooms and descend to morning breakfast: The elevators, elevator doors, and elevator shafts mainly consist of very clean glass.The staff are very pleasant. I have certainly stayed in Berlin hotels offering better breakfasts, but visitors from most countries will find the breakfast buffet to be plentiful and excellent. In a six-night stay I seldom ate any meals except breakfast in the hotel restaurants, but they seemed to be good - - serving a mix of European and Asian-influenced dishes.For visitors mainly interested in seeing the famous sites in the city center (formerly the westen side of East Berlin), the location of the hotel is excellent. The famous #100 bus stops right in front of the hotel, and one seems to stop at the hotel about every 10 minutes during most of the day and early evening.

<Content>Beautiful Beautiful Berlin This hotel is perfect. The people are friendly and efficient. We were upgraded to a business class room which was fab, views over the Berliner Dom. The aquadome in the hotel is a real feature. The location is great, easy to get to all Berlins main features and easy access to the station for the S Bahn. The Restaurant Heat in the hotel is really good, though a little pricey compared to elsewhere. A tip for those who enjoy Italian, round the corner from the hotel, to the left, is an italian called Peretti, it is really reasonably priced and the food is fantastic, u can sit in or out. Also you can get to the hotel really easily from the Airport by train, which only costs 2 euro as opposed to 35 in a taxi.

<Content>Awesome in every way! This place is awesome. Let's start with the location. It's right next door to the Berliner Dome, Nikolaiviertel, Museum Island and many other top Berlin attractions. Then there's the hotel itself. Have you ever seen an aquariam that's six storeys high? Well then check out the one in this hotel's atrium. Very impressive, but believe me, there's nothing fishy about this place. (Yuk-Yuk) I'm more of an old world hotel kind of guy; nonetheless, I was very comfortable in the modern, minimalist, yet very warm ambiance of this hotel. Of course, the staff is friendly and, more importantly, helpful. It has very comfortable beds, high-speed internet access (for a price), flat panel TVs and for you lightswitch freaks, you can turn off all the lights in your room right from your bed. It's a great place to return after checking out all that Berlin has to offer. I know there are other hotels that may be grander and more established, but when I come back I'm staying here. It's unique.

<Content>A truly awful reservations experience I use TripAdvisor.com regularly so when I saw that the Radisson SAS Berlin had been rated the number one hotel in the city I was confident I would be in for something special.Instead I was in for 8 international calls to the hotel and the central reservations number because the people I dealt with firstly reserved me rooms on incorrect dates and secondly failed to send me any kind of confirmation.I've now resolved the issue and am just hoping that my actual stay will prove less stressful than the reservations process. Based on the evidence so far, this will be a triumph of hope over experience.

I mentioned in passing to one of the staff that it was my other half's 30th birthday, and when we next came back to our room they had left him a lovely wooden box of delicious truffles. The room was lovely, beautifully designed, and we absolutely loved the spa, with its three different saunas and pool (all included in the price). My only gripe would be that the breakfast is extremely expensive, but then again you don't have to have it, so it's a small point.

As soon as you walk in, the aquarium just stuns you with its beauty and size! The staff are attentative and polite and the rooms are superb! The LCD tv's really make a difference and the room design and the 'wet room' style bathrooms are great. The spa is also one of the best!

<Content>Can't wait to go back I stayed here over Xmas. The hotel is an amazing structure and incredibly stylish without being pretentious. The location is great, near the centre and with the trendy shops  bars of Hackescher Markt a five mins walk away. The staff are helpful and attentive and the food is good. (one tip: although the food is reasonable, a bottle of water is 11 euros) Ask for a room overlooking the Berliner Dom and you will have a lovely view. Great value 99 euro rooms. Would unhesitatingly recommend.
