<Content>Good location however it needs ALOT of work done to it Excellent location.The hotel is in desperate need of a face lift.Rooms are more than generous size.The hotel has an odd smell in the foyer / lobby area - smells damp. In the 6 hours that I waited for my room to be cleaned (YES - SIX HOURS) I must have heard over a dozen times 'this hotel smells'.Although the hotel realllllllllly needs a facelift and has an odd smell - overall it was below average but not so bad you would walk out and demand your money back.Maybe some rooms have been renovated (but not mine) because the photos online looked NOTHING like my room. And I got a kick out of the photo of the waiter pouring wine into a glass - - - They do not have a restaurant! ! ! ! ! Where was that photo taken????I wouldnt stay here again, there are much better buys in Sydney to be had. PLUSES:Location +++Size of roomsFacilities such as oven, fridge, microwave, cook topMINUSESAppears no rooms are ever ready to check in toSmellsOld and dated

<Content>Good Weekender! Just back from a short weekend away for a mate's birthday. We (2 couples) booked a 2 bed apt for au$180 per night so its was good value and it's in a fantastic location. Excellent for CBD and tourist stuff but also good to get a bit rough and ready with the locals along Oxford Street.Good points: Location. Also nice view, ease of check-in, check-out and left luggage. Good size bedrooms and large living room area with comfy sofas.Bad Points: It's noisy all night (lucky i was a bit tipsy when i got back from Oxford St). We had a 13th floor room facing Hyde Park but it must be the busiest route for all fire engines, ambulances and police cars in the CBD! Tiny bathroom with no shower pressure. Decor needs updating as its like a dodgy IKEA set.Overall, 7/10 for me. Also recommend The Spanish Club, Liverpool St for some authentic tapas, Rambutan on Oxford Street for some funky thai food and excellent cocktails, The Glenmore pub at the Rocks for its roof top bar, coldies and views of the Opera House and of course Max Brenners for all that lovely chocolate. These tips courtesy of our Brissie mate who calls Sydney home and which ensured we had a blast this weekend!

<Content>No phone, Terrible service, Do not Recommend! The hotel stay was terrible. The phone did not work for the first 3-4 days of the stay and the hotel refused to compensate us or get us a better room that had a working phone. The service here was horrible - I had people trying to reach me for several days before the hotel staff was able to figure out that sending them to my room line was not actually working. I would recommend to anyone thinking of staying here to spend some extra money and go elsewhere.

<Content>Disappointed These are the problems we experienced with this hotel given that we paid for a 4.5 star room. (Room 908):-Staff generally unhelpful and disinterested.-No compendium. (Replacements apparently being printed at the time?)-TV reception was poor.-Mass of unsightly cables under the writing bureau which the TV sat on.-Smelly and musty hallways.-Mildew/mold on back of balcony curtain.-Non-fitting sink plugs.-Stained Sheets (however appear to have been washed). Maybe time for replacement.-Musty/damp smell in kitchen cupboard and draws.-Balcony door did not lock.-Outside balcony railing was loose.-Intermittent faults with door entry locks.-Malfunctioning sofa bed.-Chips and general wear and tear on furniture looked unsightly.-Pool was not heated. (Advertised as heated).-Gym equipment is old and dated.-Warning, this is a fairly dated building and maintenance appears to be lacking. We don鈥檛 consider this to be a 4.5 star establishment.Positive points:-Good location.-Individual room air conditioning worked fine.-Bathroom clean.-Modern kitchen.

<Content>surprisingly pleased After being a little nervous about our stay here, we were pleasantly surprised! Working in the hotel industry myself, i know what to look for in a bad quality hotel. Check-in and check out took no more than 2 minutes - fast, efficient service. The room was clean, bathroom and kitchen spotless and well equipped, and room service did their job every day. Even after having the 'do not disturb' sign up in the mornings, after we removed it they came back to service the room. This doesn't happen in many hotels- if the sign is there when housekeeping come past, they wont check again in the afternoon... we were on the 4th floor, so i wasn't expecting spectacular views, but we had a nice view over towards the eastern suburbs, the best at sunset and dusk. Overall, a very nice experience. The location is also perfect!! right across from hyde park and on the corner of oxford street too. literally a stones throw from all sydney has to offer! I think people are more likely to share bad experiences than good experiences, so i thought that i should give my positive experience. this hotel deserves to have the good experiences shared too.

<Content>Rude and disorganized staff Arrived from a very long flight with my husband and 3 yr old toddler. The initial receptionist was very pleasant and checked us in without any problems as everything was in order with the room number already printed on the reservation slip at the front desk. After settling in and resting for about 2 hrs, we received a shock of our lives when someone tried to open the front door of our apartment but failed then we got a call from the front desk. The Manager (some guy) had the gull to ask us to move out to another room as the room is meant reserved for someone else and said the earlier staff that checked us in was new. So what if old or new staff, this is not the way to treat guests and not even an apology was given for their mistake! I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!

<Content>[--] faulty towers wouldn't have a look in Oh where to start - was greeted by a urine smell in the foyer it should have been a warning of things to come. We checked in on the sunday for 5 nights pre paid so we couldnt check out if we wanted . Went to the lift as we were on the 11th floor one of the lifts was out of order. later in the week the second one was broken and one of us used the staircase she couldnt get out on our floor so she had to go out the bottom door onto a back alley at night the street was badly lit with loads of homeless people. the dishwasher didnt work we reported it the first day and it wasnt fixed when we left. As for the delightful receptionists very unhelpful. The bathroom ceiling over the shower was held up by a piece of wood . Daily cleaning was a minimum we were given washing up liquid when the dish washer wasnt working the cleaners came in half made the beds and as for vacuuming - i dont think they have hoovers here. Recommendation dont stay here!

<Content>Australian rip off What a bad start to australian trip. Run down hole of a place. They had my name wrong. The apartment is nothing like the photos so be very cautious. The pool is a run down bath tub, difficult to reach, The gym is a cubhoard with 3 pieces of equipment. The lifts are slow and dirty. The second bed was an old clapped out torn thing they wheeled in after we arrived. No internet connection. Male staff particularly snooty.Book at your own risk. Clearly some people liked it as it met there purpose but this place put me off Australia altogether. First impression will last forever.

<Content>Good basic centrally located accommodation Just stayed at the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza. Was a bit concerned after reading recent reviews, however I found the apartment to be clean and the reception staff very friendly. The accommodation was basic certainly not a 4.5 star, more like a 3 star. We made use of the kitchen as we have a baby. Ideal if you need these facilities. It had everything necessary. We had to provide our own portacot as there was a $30 per night fee which I found to be excessive as most places provide them for free or a one of charge. Location was ideal, very central.The weather wasn't quite hot enough for the pool. We did have a look . It is located on the roof and very small and basic, didn't feel heated though. There was also sauna and spa which people were using. I would recommend this place for families if you need somewhere basic and central with no frills.

<Content>These place is a cold blooded rip off! We paid for a 4.5 star two bedroom apartment for two nights from 7/3/2008 .We had a visitor from abroad and this accommodation looked nice to have privacy and be together too. Beautiful photos of the rooms on all their sites. We got a shock when we unlocked an ugly, dilapidated one bedroom - sleeps 4 apartment without any private sleeping arrangements.Nobody found the decency to inform us about the downgrade or to apologize. I had to go to the front desk and insist that the accommodation was not what was paid for and a far cry from the advertising material pictures. May be they thought we would not notice.The place is an overpriced, old dump, no maintenance, everything falling apart, greasy oven etc. The worst thing was that they behaved as if we were crazy to insist on getting what we paid for!I cannot believe this is happening in Australia!

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised I stayed here with a friend when my alternative accommodation fell through. She had already booked so I had no idea what to expect, but had a very pleasant stay.We stayed in a twin studio apartment with a balcony and good sized lounge/kitchen areas. The room was spacious and had a great view of Oxford St (I'd recommend staying here for Mardi Gras). It was a smoking room as my friend smokes, but I never found it a problem as she smoked on the balcony and the room didn't smell. The cleaning staff were a bit random, replacing towels that didn't need replacing and re-hanging towels that were left in the bath because we wanted new ones. I don't think the kitchen was ever cleaned, but we didn't use it. The only real problem was the bathroom tap which was extremely hard to close and therefore constantly dripping.The location is superb, right in the heart of the city. There are loads of great bars and restaurants down Oxford St and into Surry Hills and Darlinghurst. You can exercise across the road in Hyde Park or just stroll around and Myer and David Jones are a couple blocks away. Central Station is in walking distance.Overall it's quite basic, but I had everything I needed. For only $134/night I stayed in the hub of the city and had a fantastic time exploring Sydney.

<Content>Might Have Just Been Lucky! We stayed at this property for 2 nights in February. We booked a renovated studio 4.5 star room on the 4th floor through Wotif. Check in was quick and the staff pleasant. The front desk and lobby is very plain and spartan. There is no restaurant or room service as this is a serviced appartments property.The location is very convenient to the CBD, Museum train station, and busses. Our room faced east, which while had no view and faced away from Hyde Park, was very quiet. I do not know how much noise you would get facing the park and busy College Street.The room was actually a decent size and very clean. They have done a nice job renovating it. We did not find the problems that other reviewers experienced with mold, stains,tiredness, lack of hot water, rudeness of staff etc. The room while not huge, was well appointed with new furniture, beds, a good kitchenette for self catering and the bathroom was spaceous (although anyone over 6 ft may have to stoop a bit in the shower)! We actually found there was lots of hot water, although the drains were a bit slow. The air con was the ducted type and somewhat noisey, but you could turn it off, unlike some climate controlled places I have stayed at elsewhere. Basic TV channels were free. No satellite channels which I thought was a bit cheap.The 2 lifts are very small, hallways are very narrow and the hall decor looked dated even with a new coat of paint. There is a smallish hot tub and pool on the roof which we did not use due to the unseasonably bad summer in Sydney this year, and there is an on site parking area which is difficult to enter and exit (little space to turn, 2 way traffic in one lane of space etc)When we left, the automatic door failed to open and we noticed someone had actually ripped the wires out of the intercom to contact someone to let us out of the carpark. This made for a very inconvenient and interestingly convoluted trip to the front desk to open the door. I got the impression that this may have been broken for some time as the front office person just tiredly pressed the button without a sorry or any other comment, not that I could pay much attention as I scrambled up the lifts and through the carpark to jump in my car before the car park door shut before I could get out.It may well be that all rooms in this property are not created equal. By many of the other reviews, we may have been lucky. The room was good, and while the hallways were a bit tired, we only found the car park issues to be annoying. I would call the room rate as upper budget and for that I felt I got my moneys worth. The Marriott next door is much more up market and the price very much so.I would not call the room at HPP a 4.5 room though, and I can not comment on the 3.5 star or 1 and 2 bed rooms. If you are looking for a budget place and are not too bothered with a pool, hot tub, dont want a full kitchenette or on-site parking, then you may find the YWCA (across the street) or the Travelodge Wentworth (1/2 block walk) cheaper and better value for money. We have stayed at both places as well and have had no dramas, although both have also had some negative reviews.Would we stay here again? Well, we got a good deal here which represented good value for money. If we had the same deal which put the HPP into the same price range as the Y or Travelodge, then probably. Of course we would ask for the same room if available. If not, then we would probably go back to the Y.

<Content>Better than expected We booked a weekend at the HPH our payment was non-refundable through an online booking service. We were expecting the worse after the reviews of 2007 however to our surprise the room was clean, service polite and attentive and location wonderful. We stayed in an apartment on the 12 floor overlooking Hyde Park . Its a great location within easy reach of the shopping district and many other local attractions. Be aware there is no room service or restaurant on site, however many eating establishments in the area.

<Content>Good Location....That's about it. The Oaks is in a very good location. About a 5 minute walk from the metro stop and closer for buses. The price is good. Australia is EXPENSIVE! Unfortunately, that's about all that should attract you to this hotel. The room was small and tired. The hotel has seen better days and should look to renovate. The air conditioning in our room died and was never addressed. We were told the maintenance people don't work on weekends. There was an offer to change rooms, but we declined based on previous reviews. We didn't want to get stuck with a worse room than we had. The laundry facility was nice to have, but the front desk didn't have $2 coins to change that fit in the machines. I had to go around the corner to the local wine shop to get the change I needed. On the upside, the view from the roof is very pretty and the pool and spa are quite nice. The Oaks is not a bad hotel, it's just needs some cosmetic improvements and a better front desk. It was a place to collapse and sleep after long days of being a tourist. If you stay in Sydney and spend your time in a hotel room, except for sleeping, then you are really missing a fantastic city.

<Content>Great stay! great location and view My family booked a privately owned apartment in the Hyde Park Plaza in December for 2 weeks, We had a great room high up on level 13 with a fantastic view of the city. As it was a privately owned apartment we did not get the daily servicing but we saved alot of money and the studio is fitted out with vacuum etc. The room seemed fairly new and was big enough for the 4 of us. Beds where comfortable and it was great to be able to have our own kitchen to cook etc. We booked it with a guy called Paul from a company called Sydney short stay. No complaints with the room. The pool area is not was new as it once was but the location and room more than made up for it.

<Content>will not be back My wife and i stayed here for 2 weeks, we chosae this hotel as it had a great location opposite hyde park. The location was great 10 minutes walk to darling harbour and circular quay 15 minutes walk. It does have a fair enough pool and jacuzzi on roof top. The 2 bedroom apartment which we had is in need of complete reservation and had pictures that were out in the 80,s that is probably the last time it had been refurbished. The reception are is so bare with grubby carpet and lacks athmosphere. That area of oxford street is not the safest at night, sa a few incidence that were quite frighting. There is good leisure centre beside austrailia museum and the convict museum is worth a visit.A bit of care and attention would lift this hotel to a decent place to stay

<Content>Booked for five week stay- CHECKED-OUT After First Night! I had stayed at The Hyde Park Plaza (HPP) with my family as a child in the early eighties, and we enjoyed the hotel a lot.So, having a five week holiday in Sydney, i needed an Apartment. Having stayed in many Apartment hotels in Sydney, The HPP offered me the best rate.I booked one of the large refurbished one bedroom apartments on the corner of the building on a high floor with two balconies. One balcony overlooking Oxford Street, the other overlooking Hyde Park.I thought it was a fantastic deal, and from my memories of the place, was really looking forward to 'living' in my apartment.I checked in and was happy with the service from the Front Desk.When i arrived on my floor (7) i couldn't help but be 'overcome' by the strong musty smell in corridors.Opened the door to my room, and POW, the musty/damp smell nearly knocked me out!The apartment was refurbished, but it looked like it was done on the cheap. The white walls were full of marks/scuffs, and there were stains on the sofa and chairs.The Bedroom was tiny. It just fitted the Queen size bed.The Musty smell was WORSE in the bedroom.The balcony door was stiff to open and you nearly gave yourself a hernia trying to open it.The apartment had two wall air-conditioners, that could not cope cooling the place properly.The bathrroom had mould on the tiles, and the exhaust fan was dangling from the ceiling.It was not looking good for my stay!Night came, and after being out all day because i couldn't face that musty smell, i could hear the loud noise from a busy intersection below.I just wanted to get out of the place, but thought i would consider next day after a night's sleep.Now, the final straw. The matress was like a rock. Honestly, if i went outside and layed on the grass, it would have been more comfortable!At 10pm i went down to Reception and told them i can't sleep on that bed, and if there were other beds available.Guy at Reception told me that, that was the standard hotel bed for one bedroom apartments.He then told me TO PUT SOME TOWELS OVER THE TOP TO MAKE IT COMFORTABLE.I then said i wanted out.As it was late, i had to wait for the Manager in the morning to handle my refund, so it was back to the stinking, noisy and hot apartment.After sitting-up all night, i checked out in the morning.NEVER AGAIN!

<Content>DO NOT stay at the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza in Sydney If you want to be guaranteed of having somewhere to stay and receiving good customer service then DO NOT stay at the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza in Sydney. I recently went to stay there with a group of friends and I was absolutely appalled at the way we were treated. We had confirmed the booking 3 months ago, yet when we arrived at the hotel we were told that we had been bumped to a new hotel and then ushered into a taxi. This would have been fine, but when we got to the new hotel, there was no confirmed booking for us. The manager of the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza was supposed to have confirmed our booking that morning and hadn鈥檛. I called the manager at the Oaks and spoke to him and he was going to sort our booking out with the new hotel. He was even transferred straight to their reservations department. However, after waiting for half an hour and not hearing any response, I tried to call him back at the Oaks, but was told he was busy. We then called the reservations department of the new hotel and they said they were waiting on confirmation from the Oaks. We had an appointment to go to so we left and then came back an hour later only to find out the manager of the Oaks had now left for the day and we did not have a confirmed booking anywhere. And to make it worse, the hotel we were transferred to was twice the price we originally were going to pay. I can鈥檛 believe that the manager at the Oaks had left for the day without contacting us or confirming a booking for us, seeing his hotel could not fulfill our confirmed booking with them. We went back to the Oaks to try and sort this out, only to be treated like a nuisance. The hotel desk staff were so rude to us, it was shocking. They would not agree to pay the difference in costs for us upfront and confirm our booking at the new hotel. The transfer process between the hotels was not handled well by the Oaks. Basically they left us without a place to stay. We spent 71/2 hours at the Oaks trying to get them to agree to pay the difference in hotel costs, which they should have done when they transferred us originally. The only thing they could come up with was that we could travel back to the new hotel and get our bags, stay a night crammed in a 1 bedroom apartment and then go back to the new hotel in the morning and they would sort out the transfer. We didn鈥檛 want to do this because of the absolute rudeness of the staff at the Oaks, as well as hearing from other hotel guests who had been treated unethically. We had spoken to 2 separate lots of guests staying at the Oaks Hyde Park plaza and they had returned to their rooms during the day to find that the Oaks staff had packed up their belongings and moved them to a new room. This is totally illegal and should never be done. We ended up staying in the new hotel.The transfer was never sorted out by the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza. We had to confirm a booking for ourselves, luckily there were rooms available in the new hotel, but we did have to pay twice the price that we had originally booked for. The Oaks kept promising to sort out the transfer and pay the difference in costs so that we wouldn鈥檛 be out of pocket, however, it took a week after we returned from our trip for them to send us a check for the difference in accommodation costs. And this was only after we sent a letter to the head office explaining the situation. Basically the Oaks ruined our holiday and left us out of pocket. I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. It may be cheaper, but it鈥檚 not worth the hassle, when you probably will be shipped off to another hotel anyway.

<Content>beware I booked two weeks ahead,only to turn up and be told that no room was available and they were going to send me to another hotel completely distant from my expected location. My three night stay was based on walking distance to the venues I had to attend.All this was told to me by a young embarrassed receptionist,the management would not talk to me,and to this time have never expressed any regrets,I was left to find my own accomodation under considerable stress,so my planned stay in the city was not ruined.I believe this is one of many horror stories about this hotel.

<Content>Gone very down hill! I have been travelling to Sydney for the last 10 years and have always stayed at the Hyde Park Plaza because of its fantastic location, value for money rates and lovely peaceful rooftop pool. I have always enjoyed my stay here.....until now. The place has been left to fall into practical ruin and the Oaks Group should be ashamed to have it on its books because they offer some very nice properties. The rooms are shabby, the rooftop pool is filthy, there is no longer any pool furniture or chairs. Although they insist they are in the process of upgrading the hotel, they have been saying this for over 2 years without any visible difference. I would consider staying here again if they did make an effort to improve the standards but until then, I'd rather pay extra for a decent hotel in a similar location.

<Content>Major let-down We stayed just one night in a 4.5 star room at the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza. The room was very unclean, especially the bathroom. It was obvious that the rooms do not get cleaned very well. There were hairs on the bathroom floor, brown marks in the toilet and unclean surfaces in the shower and basin. We expressed our concern to staff who were quite disinterested. We were not offered a new room or a clean from house-keeping. We asked for extra towels so that we could clean the bathroom floor ourselves (we did refuse to pay the $1.50 per towel charge for these). We were excited about our stay in Sydney but a very unclean room and uncaring staff ruined our experience. Do not stay at this accommodation as it is sure to disappoint! It does not live up to its 4.5 star rating at all!!!

<Content>Ok, But Depends on the Floor I stayed in this hotel twice in August. First time was on 15th floor and the room was great. Wonderful views, balcony with furniture, nice interior. A tiny bit tired in the decor but not as bad as I thought might be the case from some reviews here. I had a one-bedroom and when you consider how expensive Sydney is in other ways (beware of parking tickets!!!), this was a really good deal to be right on the park and in the center of town. I think it was worth every penny the first time.The second stay was also a one-bedroom on the 4th floor and it was really not very nice. It was survivable and not as awful as some cheap hotels in NYC, but not nearly as nice as the 15th floor. Instead of a sofa there were two twin beds in the living room. Everything seemed a lot older. Perhaps they are doing a renovation right now and haven't gotten to the 4th floor yet. In any event, if you want a cheap, safe place to stay and you are a large group (3-4), this place is fine, even on the 4th floor. Very conveniently located and even the run down room seemed clean and comfortable, so while it isn't luxury, for the price it's quite all right.

<Content>Indifferent Stayed here for a month when I first arrived in Sydney having migrated from London. 2 positives - location is great for access to the city and my new employer was paying.Everything else about this place was mediocre at best, the gym is a joke, pool was being refurbished. Room was in need of TLC, the bed sagged, decor was tired and chintzy, sofa had a couple of nasty stains and so on....Have stayed in many better motels and budget chains for far less money than this. There are far better places in the same price range in this locality.

<Content>Great Location I stayed in one of their studios (serviced apartments) during an extended business trip. The room was fairly small but comfortable for one person. It's an old building but has been refurbished to a good standard, comfortable bed and clean.Location is excellent for Oxford Street and transport, great views over Hyde Park and looking into town. In my opinion it's a nicer location than staying in the middle of the CBD.Cons: the bathroom fan did not shut off at night (minor noise) and the heating system is a little noisy.

<Content>Great Stay We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our accommodation. Stayed for four nights. The studio appartment had just been renovated so everything was new. Looked out over the back, with a tiny balcony and small view of the city but therefore very quiet. Staff could not have been more helpful. I think they are having some problems with some of the rooms as they gradually renovate, but we certainly have no complaints! Very close to everything.

<Content>Comfort and Locatoin We stayed in a privately owned apartment in the Hyde Park Plaza which we found on craigslist.com. (owned by George). If you're in Sydney for at least a week, you can't do much better. It was clean and well maintained, with a comfortable queen size bed and a less comfortable but acceptable pull-out (for my daughter). The kitchen was well-equipped, the bathroom was modern, with a built in hair dryer, and the furnishings were perfectly adequate. The sheets and towels were high quality. The location was ideal. We could walk to most attractions from the hotel and get a bus from a half block away to everywhere else. We stayed 12 days and I was delighted to find a car rental place just next door, which was convenient when I wanted to rent a car to go to the Blue Mountains for two days. In fact, almost everything you could want was within a half a block or two: internet, grocery store, bottle store, cafe, good breakfast restaurant (LilliBlack), post office, restaurants. There was a gym, pool, and spa on the roof--the latter being great to sooth sore muscles after long days of walking. The view from the roof was spectacular, especially at night. There was nothing not to like about the place and the value was incredible. Even the reception staff was helpful, even though we weren't guests of the hotel.

<Content>Very friendly staff and good location 3 Friends and I stayed here over new year (we were very lucky to walk in off the street and be able to book for five nights after deciding not to stay in the original hotel we had booked - we bagged their last emergency room). Its not luxury by any means but we had a decent, clean room with a kitchen area and enough beds and floor space to sleep us all. Its in a great location and the staff on the desk are really friendly and helpful.If you want luxury this isnt the place for you - but if you want a clean, friendly atmosphere in a great location give it a go.

<Content>Very Disappointing Booked a so called 4.5star room. Looked at 2 before I had no choice but to accept one which was badly maintained, had 3 lights out, smelled of mould, balcony door did not lock and TV could not be switched off using remote control. There are much better rooms at this price in Sydney. I'll never go back.

<Content>Disappointed We have just returned from a 4 day stay at the Oaks Hyde Park Plaza and were disappointed in our accomodation. We had booked a 4.5* (reburbished) studio room and were looking forward to a little bit of luxury. The rooms have had a cheap makeover. All fittings seem of the budget kind with taps that wobbled and cheaply veneered furniture. Already our newly refurbished room (801) had scuff marks on white walls, veneer missing from vanity unit, deep scratches on table, grout missing in bathroom and deep ridges with mould around the bath. On top of this when we returned after walking for hours sightseeing, we had nowhere comfortable to sit, only hard upright chairs or the alternative was to lie on the bed. We had expected a small sofa and asked the front desk on arrival if we could move to another room with a small sofa or comfortable chairs, they said they would try to move us but nothing eventuated. The room was serviced daily but not cleaned. Outside the Hotel there is noisy and messy work being carried out on the hotel forecourt with scaffolding and dangerous pedestrian entry. The front desk area is tired and grubby looking. So much for our hopes of a little 4.5* comfort! We visit Sydney often, but we'll try elsewhere next time as we have experienced much better for the same price range. Only positive being that the location is good as it is within walking distance of central shopping area, Queen Victoria Building, China Town, Art Gallery and Museum with a longer walk to Circular Quay.

<Content>Excellent location, good value I was very pleased to wind up my holiday in Australia in this hotel -- I got what appeared to be an excellent price using a hotel booking website, and was quite pleased with value for money -- a rather large room, with full kitchenette, refrigerator, very effective air conditioning, etc. Based on my recent experience, at the rate I paid (about AUS$130 a night), it's definately the best value for money in CBD.

<Content>Four and a half stars??? Yeah right!!! I arrived at 5pm, 3/10/06 and was greeted by the courteous-but-rushed receptionist, and after some 15 minutes waiting, a room was assigned to me, room 702. Upon entering my room, which was booked as a 4.5star studio apartment, I was confronted with a shame of a room. Yes, it was decorated with modern colours, relatively new furniture, and quite clean. But that was where it ended. The extractor fan in the bathroom was hanging by a thread. The TV didn't work - both a poor picture quality and the remote control did not work. Two cushions on the sofa were split and the stuffing hanging out. The bathroom smelled of stale water... the list went on. I called to speak to the manager, and was *rudely* told that he would call me back. 30 minutes passed, and I left my room and went back to reception where I was told the manager had just left for the day by the same person I had spoken to earlier. I listed my complaints to the recption staff. There were around 8 other people in the lobby, all of who were dealing with similar problems, and all of whom were similarly disgruntled. After a further 15 minutes wait, I was handed another room key, this time room 1402. I travelled up to my floor and whilst walking down the corridor, I was confronted with a strong smell of paint. When I reached my room, the door was propped open and inside was a construction worker busily painting the room! There was dust everywhere, paint tins, brushes etc etc. I called down to the reception to inform them of their mistake, and was told to hold on again while they tried to rectify the problem. After a further 10 minute wait, the receptionist arrived at the room with a key to yet another room. this time it was room 709. I was assured it was a great room, a 1 bed apartment and was definitely ok. This it was, and after over an hour of messing around, I was able to settle into my home for the next few nights. I find it absolutely shocking that any hotel can advertise, yet alone be rated by AAA as being a 4.5star property. In the state that this place is in, even after a lick or two of paint, I would rate it at no more than 3.5star. Sure the facilities are useable, but they are DEFINITELY not Excellent quality accommodation, furnishings and facilities. as described by the AAA ratings. And this is what I am supposed to have paid for - I chose to stay in a 4.5star facility and yet received more than sub-standard accommodation. I do hope that my feedback will actually do something to alert you guys to this, I travel to Sydney a lot, and have stayed in many different places each time, and I have never encountered anything as frustrating or badly described as this.

<Content>High Standard, great location, best rates we could find - highly recommended We are writing this so that prospective guests get a balanced view of this property. We stayed at the Hyde Park Plaza Building several times (last time in May 2006); not with Mirvac (pre November 2004 operator but with couple of other (small) operators who own apartments in the building. We find the hotel very pleasant. On two occasions we stayed, we found the studios great! Newly refurbished, very clean and of high standard. The common areas are sleek and of very high standard also. Had we read the reviews earlier we wouldnt have booked and wouldn't have taken advantage of the great rates offered to us! Waldek

<Content>Disgusting dump A fiend and I had the misfortune of being booked into the Oaks for 3 nights while in Sydney for a conference. The lobby smelt terribly of cigarette smoke but that was nothing compared to our room. The bath was cracked and black grime was deeply embedded in these cracks. The shower taps fell off in your hands and the water from the shower re-entered the bathroom through the over flow drain in the floor, disgusting to say the least. The bed spreads were also filthy and the blankets had obviously not been washed in some time either. Resturant and bar services were also advertised on their web site but not available when we arrived. Overall a very disappointing stay and one that will not be repeated or recommended to traveling friends.

<Content>great stay we stayed at the oaks hyde park in a self contained studio for 4 nights. it has just been refurbished (parts of hotel still being painted etc) and our room was great. new kitchenette, carpet, and decor, freshly painted. the bed was king size and very comfortable, lots of space including sofa, coffee table and small dining table and 4 chairs, it was at the back of the hotel and was very quiet. after reading previous reviews i was a bit worried before arriving as i had already booked.the very low rate included a simple breakfast.we didnt use any extras as the internet was expensive. no room service but who cares.we really enjoyed our stay.
