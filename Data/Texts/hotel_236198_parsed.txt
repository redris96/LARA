<Content>Good Hotel for The Money We selected this hotel after reading the reviews on Travel advisor. We sayed here in November for 3 nights before our Trans-atlantic cruise to New York City. The hotel has a very good location. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast, which consists of juices, coffee, tea, cereals, fruits and rolls is an added plus. Also beer and bottled water are complimentary. The rooms are very pink, but comfortable and very clean. We had a balcony room overlooking Las Ramblas, which was pretty noisy at night. The rooms had a small refrigerator and a safe. We were pleased with the price and the service. I would stay here again.

<Content>Good - with reservations One night stay after a Mediterranean cruise. Plenty of other US guests we met were staying either before or after a cruise.Pros: Location, location, location. Half block from Plaza Catalunya with the airport and HOHO busses. Right in the heart of the city. Can't be beat.The 24 hr availability of beverages and snacks. Great concept and we took advantage of it. We arrived at the hotel around 8:45 AM - couldn't check in until 1 PM but we were invited to take advantage of the food for breakfast. Very friendly staff.The room has a small fridge and microwave and there are several food shops (the basement of El Corte Ingles and a small Carrefour store) nearby so if you were planning a long stay you could have several meals in your room.Cons: To be courteous, the hotel is old fashioned. Really, it's a quasi-dump. The hallway carpet is squares of carpet-tile haphazardly placed over really, really old frayed carpet. The carpeted floor of our room looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since Franco was in power. The beds were so hard both my husband and I had backaches the next day. If this is a three star hotel in Spain, it would probably be a one star in the US.Would we stay here again. Absolutely, only because of the location.

<Content>We liked it We stayed the night before  the night after our Med cruise. We reserved a room with a balcony overlooking Las Ramblas  enjoyed it greatly. The staff were very kind  helpful. The all-day breakfast and free water  sodas were a nice bonus. We were able to use their computer  got our boarding passes before leaving for the airport. Would highly recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great Location!! I stayed in the Hotel Continental in October 2008. The set up is quite strange in that there are three hotels in the one block (like a converted apartment block). Floor 2 is Hotel Continental. Stepping out of the lift, the carpet was grim, the corridor not decorated. Taking an immediate left you are greeted by a heavy door. This leads you to the lobby. I say lobby. More like a small room. The staff were polite, but quite standoffish. No one showed us to our room, we were given a key and told - down the corridor to your left. The couple behind us were then checked in. The room was small. The size of a standard master bedroom, same with the ensuite. The room was clean. However the decor (pink walls, pink ceiling (!), pink bedspread, dark carpet, dark curtain and cream net curtain) was definately outdated. The balcony was small but had a terrific view of La Ramblas - the main street in the area. The all day breakfast (included in the price) was a great bonus, and there was a generous selection of food. The location of this hotel was what drew me to it. Directly on La Ramblas, you are at the heart of hustle and bustle of the city. The marina to you left (approx 5 minute walk), and a bus tour centre location to your right (approx 2 minute walk). There is a great pizzaria next door to the hotel, and the hard rock caf茅 is out of the hotel, follow the road to the right, and right again (opposite the fountains) - approx 2 mins away. In all, I would stay here again - the location of this hotel cannot be beaten. If you are looking for modern, do not book here. If you are looking for somewhere to rest your head after a day sightseeing, then this is the hotel for you!

<Content>Hotel is homely, comfy, and in a great location This hotel is great, the 24/7 buffet is very handy and well-stocked. The supply of free beverages was extremely appreciated. The rooms have a homely atmosphere, much removed from the average clinical modernist hotel room. Staff were friendly and professional. Rooms cleaned to a very high standard. Located in a very central location, next to all forms of transport. I would recommend this place to ANYONE

<Content>It's cheap but what a dump The room we had for my family was tiny. The review I read said that the rooms were small, but this was ridiculous. The room itself was clean and the bathroom was the nicest thing about the room. The hallway was a DUMP. The hallway carpet was filthy. I took the elevator to the street and my wife and kids walked down the stairs, only to find a homelss person asleep in the stairwell. Not exactly the way we wanted to end our Spanish vacation.

<Content>Above Expectations We had read all about the weird decor, we'd read all about the 24hr buffet and we'd read all about the location location location. What we didn't expect was the 5 star attitude of the staff.We were warmly welcomed at reception, our room was ready (at 10am), the front desk staff were knowledgeable and always very helpful, and the domestic staff were unobtrusive and did a great job. I would definitely recommend a stay here.I would have liked to have seen some ham and cheese at the breakfast buffet, as 3 days on eggs and tomatoes can lead to the possibilities of ..... well that's not something to go into here, but, we strolled to the local supermercado and bought a pack of cheese and ham for less than 2 Euro and, having stored them in the in-room refrigerator, had one morning of majestic breakfasting!! Viva El Continental.

<Content>Great Location  Great Location - On Ramblas itself just down from Cataluyna Plazza. Good value for money. Room average size, bed comfy. Bathroom average - not cramped. Had a rear of hotel room so didnt get any street noise, was on the dark side, but as i wasnt getting in until 2 or 3 am it wouldnt have mattered and only used the room to shower and sleep. Aircon great and was necessary - 30c during day in the shade and 24c at midnight!. Strange really old fashioned decor and covers on furniture, but all adding to a rather strange charm. Buffet style breakfast - mainly consisting of bread, fruit juice coffee, boiled eggs and cereals. No cooked stuff such as sausages or bacon. But absolutely fine. Great city, lots to do. Dont take any valuables out with you where at all possible, just leave them in your room safe at night. I would post some pictures except I had my camera stolen (pick pocketed) on the second night. They probably thought it was my wallet, but all my cash was double pinned in the lower pockets of ny shorts. I think they used the old diversion tactic of brushing againt you so that you notice them knocking into you, while they help themselves to the contents of your pocket. Still had a good holiday though.

<Content>Unusual but the best location The Hotel design and internals are out of the 1930's, but it is clean, the service is very good, and the breakfast and eating area are very good. For its location, it was great value for money and in the centre of everything. I would stay again, but would ask for a front high room.

<Content>Fab Central location My four friends and I have just returned from an extended weekend break in Barcelona staying at the Continental Hotel. For anyone wanting a modern or trendy hotel then this is possibly not the one for you, there are plenty of newer ones around, however if you are looking for a modest and clean hotel, with friendly service then you will not get better. The hotel is 'shabby chic' at its best, offering excellent value for money and you could not get a better location if you want to be central. The small balconies offer the perfect place to sit and watch the world go by right in the heart of the city. We were in Barcelona for 2 nights but 3 days so needed somewhere to put our luggage after checking out, there is a secure luggage room that allows you to keep everything there with peace of mind that it is safe.The complimentary refreshments are a life saver, the temparature over the weekend touched the 100s so the cool bottled water that was always availabke was well recieved, as was the fresh coffee,.I would certainly recommend hotel this for short city breaks and will not hesitate to book again.

<Content>Great bargain My wife and I stayed at the Hotel for three nights prior to a cruise we were taking. In my opinion the hotel is a great value. We had an inside room that was very small. The room was clean, and we were able to check in early (10am), That allowed us a full day to sightsee. Probably the biggest plus factor was the location. The hotel is at the top of La Rambla. and only a short (2blocks) walk from the main bus boarding area. The airpost shuttle bus completes its run here and is the best way to get into the city a lso the boarding point for the double decker city tour bus is also very close by. The breakfast buffet is available all day. We paid less than 90 euros per night and at that rate it was a great bargain.  One last comment regarding Barcelona. Its a wonderful place but heed the warning about pickpockets. They are very skilled and in my opinion you must be very , very careful. I thought I was but it turned out i wasn't careful enough.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel! My husband and I started out 16 day European journey in Barcelona and 2 nights at Hotel Continental. We took the bus from the airport which dropped us off a block away from the hotel. Located right on Las Ramblas the hotel is in a great location! When we got to the hotel our room was available, even though it was only 10a.m. so we were grateful for that. In order to beat jet lag we dropped our stuff off in the room and headed back out for the day and fought through the sleepiness, IT WORKED!!!!!!! They were very friendly at the front desk. There was a cooler of free sodas and water, plus breakfast and snacks out all day in the lobby. Our room was great and quirky, fairly small, bold green carpet, pink walls, plastic furniture, but a huge bathroom! Bottom line, the bed was comfortable and that's all we cared about! There was an issue with out balcony door, which they fixed immediately and it is important to know how that you have to put your key in the device on the wall to get the electricity to work! Overall, it was a great way to start our vacation!

<Content>Perfect for three ladies Lovely stay one night before cruise. Right in the middle of everything, near the Mercat, near the Placa Catalanya, very close to the El Corte Ingles. Taxi site is a few meters up the street. Had a lovely night in the area around Santa Maria del Mar, a short taxi drive away. Everything is neat and clean. And very pink and feminine. The safes were working perfect and were easy to use. The staff really friendly and helpful. The taxi driver from the airport had'nt heard of the hotel, probably because of a modest entrance and the fact that the hotell is located in the third floor. So keep the street adress in order to go there. We will definately go back, certainly with girl friends and women in my family, this is a pink and flowery, feminine place. I take my sons and husband back in july, then we are staying a few meters away, at the Citadines.

<Content>Loving IT!!! Brilliant location, right on the Ramblas. Little balcony overlooking the Ramblas, ideal to watch the world go by. Very quaint and old fashioned hotel. decor is amazingly odd. Room comfortable but small. All amenities right in the centre. Fab all day buffet, with free beer and water. For the price this is the best central location. My teenage daughter thought it was cool!! despite the curtain between the bedroom and bathrom. Microwave and fridge in your room means snacks are cheap and cheerful. If you want a high class hotel this is not for you, but for good central accomodation that doesn't cost the earth this is the one. Staff are very helpful and pleasant.

<Content>its all in the location Me and my 2 friends stayed here last October for 3 nights,just taken a while to getting round to writing the review!! Anyway,this was a treat for me as i was on holiday on my own,leaving husband and 2 small children at home,so it was a much needed break!!We checked in at about 10.30 pm and were given our keys and instructions to our in room safes,my room wasnt a bad size,queen bed and a nice bathroom,however,from the minute i walked into my room i noticed a really horrible false smell,if you know what i mean,i dont know if it was the a.c but it was not nice,and sooo strong.Anyway,one of my friends was upstairs and her room was much bigger than mine! and my other friends room was the smallest,it was very small,but neither of theirs had the horrible smell that i had.So,we put our bags in and went straight out,i was really shocked at how busy it was,we had been warned about pick pockets and kept our bags tight to our bodies,i did feel a little unsafe to begin with but soon got used to it.There are some great restaraunts nearby,some that were stupidly expensive and some very reasonable,on the whole eating and drinking was much cheaper than i thought it would have been.Hard rock cafe,tour buses and shops just round corner,so the location was perfect.Also i must tell you and you must go,we were desperate to see real Flamenco and considdered going to the restaraunt over the road,cant remember the name,but it was something ridiculouse like 90 euros for dinner and show which we thought was too much,we asked at the reception of the hotel who were extremely helpfull and directed us to Las Tarantos,i think it was in the plaza(great big square 5 minutes walk away with loads of restaraunts and bars etc).Anyway,the show started at 8 i think but we were told to arrive early which we did.The place itself was very tucked away,we had been sitting opposite it the night before and hadnt realised it was there!!!But it was beautifull,vrrrery small and dark with little round tables and Gaudi style seating areas,you get the picture!!!It was lovely.The show was just fantastic and at 6 euros,you cant knock,but i cant tell you enough how fantastic it was,it was breathtaking,no touristy stuff,just proper flamenco with fantastic music and singing,my friends and i went for pizza after and loved it that much that we went in again for the last show,its even cheeper second time round at 4 euros!!!Anyway,im getting eye ache now,but the hotels location was good and the buffet was very handy and staff very helpfull,as mentioned by someone else,the hallways are pretty bad,just dont look down and spry lots of perfume in your room!!!For the price we paid it was very good and easy for sightseeing,but you must make sure you go to Las Tarantos,it made our holiday!!!Ive since found out it is the oldest Flamenco bar in Barcelona....that explains everything!!!

<Content>Hotel Continental Terrific! Wow! The hotel is located on the Ramblas which is a central outdoor shopping area where people walk and talk all day and night. We had a balcony worth the price of the room overlooking the Ramblas where we took our morning breakfast and late night coffee. The hotel has available 24 hour refrigerated bottled water and a variety of coffees and teas. Also available 24 hours are a comforting buffet of fruit, cereal, soft boiled eggs, various breads, and other food I can't recall now. The room had a refrigerator and microwave. We put the water in the 'fridge and did not have the occasion to use the micro. The room was beautifully decorated, had a queen bed and a single bed where we placed our suitcases. It was super clean, as was the bathroom. The staff was well versed in English. We will return to the hotel when next we visit Barcelona. It is located by the cathedral and within walking distance of the Picasso museum. All sites in the city are accessible from the metro stop across the street from the hotel. The Cervezarria across the street had great tapas downstairs and an upscale restaurant upstairs.

<Content>Bring earplugs and wear a blind-fold We picked this hotel based on Rick Steve's review in his Spain 2008 book. His review is mostly spot-on except for one detail. The noisy plumbing. The plumbing (sound of water constantly running) is louder and more annoying than the street noise from Las Ramblas. My husband and I booked a one week stay at this hotel and we were ready to leave after Day 2. We ended up staying the entire week because we couldn't find another affordable hotel (we paid 122 euros a night and the other hotels were quoting 200+ euros/nt). The location is excellent. In the end, I would recommend this hotel only to those who don't care about staying in a hotel with old decor, sitting on plastic chairs, and can sleep through any noise. I bought ear plugs and that helped a lot!

<Content>Great location and staff!!!! We stayed here 3 days in March after a cruise. We went on a city tour and was let out about a half a block from the hotel so we did not need to use a taxi to get from the docks. The location could not be better, right by the tourist bus and the metro. There is a Hard Rock around the corner and large department stores close by. The hotel was clean and I felt very safe. The staff was excellent. They were very helpful and friendly. This is a small older hotel but for the price could not be better. I would stay there again and would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Location, Location! The hotel's location is great- at the top of La Rambla, literally a 5 min walk from the airport bus that costs 4.50 euros each way. The sightseeing bus is a 3 min walk at Plaza Catalunya.The hotel's decor is very unique and dated but charming. This is a very basic one star hotel similar to a guest house.The beds have foam mattresses.The english speaking staff is very helpful and it is rare to find any hotel offering 24hrs snacks, sodas, beer and bottled water for free. There is also a computer available for guests use and it is free. We booked a balcony room overlooking La Rambla. This was great for people watching but with the door closed you could still hearing the rowdy revelers at 2am. Would not recommend balcony room for light sleepers. Good value for money. Would stay here again.

That was the only negative though.For the money, in a superb location with a great view, what more can you ask for?The all day buffet was great, really nice to come in at 2 am. and get a glass of juice and a coffee before bed. (which was very comfortable as well) Friendly staff, it was great being able to sit on the veranda looking down at the Ramblas in the late afternoon sun too.I certainly won't be looking further than this hotel when we return to Barcelona, we loved it!

<Content>Locations, Locations, Locations! We booked the hotel through online agent, and being family with 2 young children, as usual booked a triple room for three. Turns out the hotel have a policy of maximum allowable number of people in one room - but was resolved, and we were helped by adding a mattress. With the price we're paying, we expected a teeny-tiny room with a broomcloset-like bathroom/shower as with other hotels in Europe. I braced myself for having to do acrobatic tricks while taking a shower to cope with the cramped quarters. The room was quite small but not as small as the ones we had in London hotels with the same price, and found - surprise, surprise! - a (small) full bathroom with bathtub, that even have a bidet! It's true that the decors are too pinkish and flowery for my taste but who wants to stay in their hotel room and stare at the wall for too long in lively Barcelona? Furnitures are cloth covered plastic - but we only use them to dump our backpacks on when we were sleeping anyway! We opted for a room overlooking the Ramblas and we're glad we did. The view was magnificent and if you want you can stay for hours looking at the passing crowd and street performers below. Locations is everything for a hotel. Continental Barcelona is at the North end of Las Ramblas, only a few yards away from Plaza Catalunya, Barri Gothic, Metro, El Corte Ingles Dept. Store, Carreour Express, the stop for Barcelona Tour Bus and endless shops along Las Ramblas. Hard Rock Cafe and Starbucks is just around the corner so this one has a perfect location to start your adventure in Barcelona! Being family with children, we love the convenience of having the 24 hour snack and drinks at the hotel. No more rushing to the supermarket for evening milk for the kids while we were there! On Christmas day they even handed out free champagne for guests! The staff are very friendly, polite and helpful and they will go out of their way to make things work for you. Cristina, Peter and others at the front desk will make sure you have all that you need, and help out with enquiries on what to see and where to go in the city, even handed out the brochures for some of the local attractions. They were very helpful and caring, and help with taxi orders even after we have checked out from there! We will definitely stay there again the next time we visit Barcelona after our experience with the hotel.

<Content>NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I spent three nights in Barcelona after our cruise and we chose to stay at the Hotel Continental on Las Ramblas due to the location and price. WORD OF ADVICE.....DON'T!!!! First the positive....Honestly the only positive things I can say about the hotel are the fact that you get free soft drinks, water and beer while you are there and the location is a plus.The reality....-The rooms were tiny-The rooms were worn and out-dated-The furniture pieces were plastic rubbermaid organizers with a metal sheet on top to create a table. -The bathroom was a little moldy and the cold water was not coming into the shower on the first night. The bathroom itself is bad enough, but the fact that I had to bathe in boiling water is ridiculous.-There were two small towels and two bath towels. No hand towels, tub mat, washcloth or anything of the sort. -Couldn't turn off the heater, so we opted for regulating the temperature with the amount of air coming in from the window-The bed was hard as a rock-The pigeons outside our window would not let us sleep-Getting the toilet to flush toilet paper was a 1/2 hour ordeal-The key was attached to a ruler, so everyone would leave their keys at the front desk in order not to have to carry the thing all day-The maid smelled so bad you could smell her all the way down the hall and around the corner.Word of advice....pay a little more so you can rest and enjoy your stay in Barcelona.

We had a balcony room, which was a good size for Europe. The room were a little worn but they are functional and fit the purchase. The balcony was real nice to sit out on and eat breakfast in the morning. The buffet was great and we were able to stock up on drinks for our cruise.

This hotel is decorated in Laura Ashley on steriods. Pepto Bismol Pink. The rooms and baths were tiny, but clean. Our room had a terrible odor(284) and the staff tried twice to fix it without success. The 24/7 breakfast bar is great and is free internet in the lobby. The staff was also excellent. The location was center city, but watch out for the crime on Las Rambla-it is bad.

<Content>Great location I believe Hotel Continental is a specialty. Located in the heart of the Gothic quarter it is a very good base for walking tours. I guess the rooms can be small for Americans but we thought they were O.K. (We have seen a lot more worse). Even the size of the room is small it has everything you need-a pretty functional room. Our room even had a microvawe which we did not use as we always ate out. One other great thing about the hotel was the free snack bar open 24 hours a day. I will definately be staying there again if I ever go to Barcelona again.

<Content>Location, location, location I stayed here earlier this month and was very impressed. Do not be put off when you enter the reception area (2nd floor of building) as it looks a little shabby, with worn carpets and wallpaper beginning to peel off. This only adds to the charm of the hotel. The location is it's outstanding feature being on The Ramblas and only 30 yards from Plaza Catalunya. This makes it so easy to get around the city (nearest subway is 20 yards away).The rooms are small but functional and I wouldn't bother with the breakfast but there are plenty of cheap cafe's around where you can get a good breakfast. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is free internet access, soft drinks and beer. If you're thinking of coming to Barcelona, give this place serious considertaion.

<Content>Hotel Continental Freebies, Fabulous, Functional, The location and freebies made this a wonderful experience along with the staff, free internet and clean rooms. For those that require perfection, don't book this hotel but for those that appreciate a reasonable comfort level with above-average attitude, you can't beat this hotel and the staff. The online pictures dress it up a bit but who doesn't do that? If you are not satisfied, you politely let the reception know what your problems are and they immediately go about correcting it. Rooms on La Rambla are a little more noisey unless you are used to city night sounds and people enjoying themselves so use earplugs or request an interior room and save a little money. We had four rooms and they all had a bathtub, frig, microwave, ac, fan. The food reception area has a balacony to view the activity outside and there's always lots of it! Perfect location for transportation. The metro steps away, the buses passing right by, the taxi stand steps away at the corner, the aerobus and tourist bus steps away from Placa Catalunya. Can't be beat. Across the street is a small opera house with very good performances of program of song and dance of Spain. Reasonable and entertaining. If you have a short stay, use the tourist bus one day and if you have 4-6 days, get the 2 day pass. You go to all the major sights with stops and see all of Barcelona. The info booth is across the street from the hotel down the La Rambla. Write any questions you have and I will be happy to answer you.

<Content>excellent location good location, but ask for a room overlooking the street for the best rooms. We had a very small inside room which was very shabby. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.The breakfast is available all day and complimentary soft drinks too, which makes it very good value for money.

<Content>Great Location and Friendly Service We recently stayed at this hotel for 2 seperate stays - Pre and Post Cruise. ROOMS - The rooms are typical European size. The hotel is currently being renovated, and the rooms are in much better shape than the hallways. The rooms have excellent A/C, something not all hotels have, very thick mattress, but somewhat on the hard side. The bathroom was modern, and had excellent water pressure and hot water. There is a blow dryer and a small TV. The rooms are very quaint. STAFF - I can not say enougth good things about the staff, they are very helpful, can tell you how to find anything around town, and will go an extra mile to help you. They provided us with a fan, because we forgot our small one, and like to sleep with the white noise. They also kept our son's treasured blanket safe for him for 2 weeks, because he forgot and left it there while we where on our cruise. We asked for blankets, and they had them there in about 2 minutes. AMENITIES: They have an all day free drink and snack bar area. You can get soft drinks, bottled water, milk,muffins, cereal, toast, cookies, and boiled eggs at any time. They have a small dining area over lookingLa Rambles, that has a wonderful breeze blowing in all the time. They also have free wireless internet. LOCATION; The location can't be beat. It is at the top of La Rambles, and about 2 minutes from Catalunya Square. You can walk, catch the tourist bus or subway, or be at the biggest deparment store all within a couple of minutes. Hard Rock is right around the corner, Burger King and McDonalds are across the street, if you want a taste of the USA. Tapas and shopping are right there. OVERALL: A wonderfully friendly and helpful staff with a great location, good AC, and a modern bathroom. We would recommend it to anyone, but those who are seeking an elegant or really special experience.

<Content>good basic hotel in a great location I try to get to barcelona once or twice a year to watch a bit of football and after stumbling across this hotel on the guardian travel website a few years ago always stay here. the location is ideal, 3 minutes walk from placa catalunya where the aerobus terminates. staff are friendly and speak excellent english.rooms are basic but clean. beds are fine, showers are hot. 110 euros a night will get you a room overlooking the ramblas and you can help yourself to beer and soft drinks for free. breakfast is also included. this is nothing special, basically toast, cereal, hard boiled eggs, kiwis and coffee or orange juice, all self service. i stay here with friends and i love it, but if i was travelling with a partner who i was trying to impress i may go elsewhere. they have a sister hotel in the eixample which is slightly more expensive but better for couples

<Content>Great Location I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last week. Despite the shabby decor as some of reviews described, I think it has a great location right at Las Ramblas, with Metro stop literally across the street, Bus stop (including airport shuttle) and whithin walking distanced to Barri Gotic, Picasso Museum and many tapas bars.The key is to ask for a quiet room facing the back, away from noisy Ramblas. (and also 10 bucks cheaper).They are proud for a all day snack bar, which is just OK. A bunch of carbs with little taste, plus coffee and orange juice. I recommend having that maybe a day or two and trying the tapas bar at Boqueria market for breakfast, for around 4 euros.The room was clean, had a safe, frigobar and hairdryer.Internet was available for free at the lobby.I would probably stay there again.

<Content>Super Hotel Great Location! Just back from a 5 day stay at the hotel and we had a great time. One of the best things about this hotel was the central location. I would recommend booking a room with a balcony on Las Ramblas - great for people watching whilst partaking in a free beer! The free soft drinks/ beer and buffet were super value. Although the decor was unusual the rooms were clean and staff were very helpful. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Barcelona.

The decor wasn't the best and the rooms were small but the beds were comfortable and it was clean. You had free sodas and water and 24 hour snacks and free internet. We paid 80 Euros for 2 people and you can't beat the price. The staff was very nice and suggested many places to eat and what areas not to miss. It was a wonderful stay and I would stay here again.

<Content>I loved it! Just back from a 3 day stay at the Continental and I loved it! The location could not be better and the staff in the hotel were extremely professional and helpful. It's true that it is far from a 'boutique' hotel and it could be described as a bit shabby and worn but other things more than make up for that - the location, the cleanliness, the free internet access, the all day buffet, the free beer and soft drinks and the old world atmosphere in the place. It really is like you are staying in a building that is a genuine part of Barcelona history. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it - but don't expect luxury, expect character!

<Content>We Loved the Hotel Continental!!!!! Great hotel!We moved from another (dreadful) hotel to the Continental and have nothing but great things to say about it! Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff at the front desk as well as in housekeeping. My boyfriend needed pants taken up and after searching all morning for a tailor, a nice lady in housekeeping volunteered to stay after her shift to do it. Breakfast bar and free drinks 24/7. These were welcome treats when we stopped in mid-day for a rest. The location absolutely cannot be beaten!!! Right on The Ramblas and less than a half-block from Plaza Catalonya.The rooms are cute as can be. Highly decorative with comfy beds. Very, very small, however, so be careful with kids or lots of luggage. Nice bathroom with big tub which made me a very happy traveler!

On the plus side the location is fab and the staff very helpfull, the breakfast stuff left out all day for you to help yourself any time and as often as you like, there was free beer and soft drinks in the lobby, The linen was changed daily so for the price it was reasonable just dont think you are getting anything near a 3 star hotel.

It was great to sit out and watch the comings and goings on the street. The staff are wonderful and always helpful. The free 24 hours non stop breakfast with free beer, soft drinks, tea and coffee was a very welcome treat after sightseeing. Would definately recommend this hotel, it was reasonable priced and a terrific location right in the heart of the city.

<Content>The best hotel in Barcelona We were here earlier this year during the World Cup and the Festa de Saint Joan. Its a great location, and as everyone has said the buffet breakfast, drinks, and free internet always keep me coming back - other than the magnificent location. I have stayed here about 5 times and when I havent stayed at this hotel, its not the same. The rooms are clean and very cute, although they are beginning renovations and re decorations of the hotel. great family run hotel and the staff are always so friendly and will help you out in any way you need ( as we found when we needed to go to Hospital del Mar at 11pm one night)During the warmer weather i recommend a balcony room if you can get one but you need to book well in advance.I always make sure they're available for my trips to Barcelona.

<Content>A nice surprise! So, it's not the Ritz, but you're not paying Ritz prices either. We stayed two nights here pre-cruise, August 16 and August 17. We were fortunate enough to have a balcony room and so had a great view of Las Ramblas and all of it's activity. Sure, it was noisy, although they have a nice sound filter shade that really helps keep some of the noise out late at night. We had no trouble sleeping. The furnishings are humble, quaint, bordering on tacky, but certainly functional. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning and it was fun meeting the other guests. Having free drinks any time and free internet access is a REAL plus. I must say that the staff were wonderful and very helpful. My husband's luggage was lost by the airlines and the front desk manager spent a lot of time on the phone trying to locate it for us. Unfortunately, we didn't see that suitcase until almost 3 weeks later when we returned home to Tampa after the cruise!This hotel has a GREAT location and is a real value for the $$. We would stay here again.

<Content>Great place A quaint hotel in the middle of Las Ramblas, this place offers good value, service and comfort. It is right on top of Las Ramblas, so noise is an issue, with late (every night) revellers disturbing any semblance of tranquility. But such is life in Spain, where things don't really get started until midnight. This place suits the traveller attempting an authentic touristic experience, by ingratiating themselves into the culture rather than a guide-book volture who prefers early nights. We were astounded too by the fact that drinks (beer, soft drinks and waters) were provided to guests for free. Its true, and we made the most of this hospitality. Also, the breakfast buffet is available 24 hours a day. Breakfast is simple (boiled eggs, tomotoes, breads) but decent. Trust the advice of the hotel staff, they know good restaurants in the area.

<Content>Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Other than being in a good location this hotel was the worst. It was dirty, cramped and noisy! Just about every surface was covered in a horrible toile fabric. This awful fabric was covering plastic lawn furniture and even the dressers were plastic bins. The towels in the bathroom smelled bad and the shower was almost impossible to work and neither the hairdryer nor the TV worked. I stayed here three nights and hardly slept due to how noisy it was...it was like the other patrons were in our room with us! I would never stay here again. Even my husband who has backpacked through Europe was grossed out by this room.

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise We recently spent 3 nights at Continental Barcelona with our two children before cruising. Not too many choices when traveling with 4. I'd been to Barcelona before and was concerned that this location might be too noisy. We had a room without balcony and never heard a sound from the streets. The location can't be beat! We arrived from the metro and saw our hotel right away. Though the room was a bit shabby, the children had a separate sleeping room and their own bathroom (both surprises). With the Barcelona heat, having free cold drinks (bottled water, bottled beer, botled soda) free, at our disposal was quite a treat. Even the breakfast was enjoyable. I've never tasted such a delicious orange juice, and the hard boiled eggs with the bright orange yolks were great. It appeared that they were refurbishing some of the rooms, though the presence of workers was not a problem, as they were always polite and only worked during daytime hours. I hope to return to Barcelona, and will certainly consider staying at the Hotel Continental Barcelona again.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised We stayed at this hotel in the last weekend in May 2006. The central location was excellent - the hotel was right on Las Ramblas in the city centre. The metro station was 100 metres away and the bus to the airport stopped within 100 metres. The hotel's decor is very dated and when we arrived there were signs saying they were in the process of renovation (just think florally, pastel wallpaper and bedspreads). However, the rooms were clean with a decent bed and large bathroom with good shower. We had a room that did not face on to Las Ramblas and it was so quiet we overslept every morning. The room had air-conditioning and a fan but we could also leave our window open which was good. The rooms are basic with a small fridge and small TV but that is exactly what we wanted - who spends much time in their room anyway when in Barcelona? The 24 hour buffet was great - especially the free drinks. We were able to get free bottled water at any time during the day. I would reccommend staying here if you are looking for a hotel with a central location and clean rooms with no fancy decor.

<Content>Excellent breakfast buffet and location I have just signed in and I have been checkin on opinions on the several hotels I've stayed at. I am very surprised at the last review on Hotel Continental!!! Whenever I go to Europe I try to stop by in Barcelona, and I always stay at this hotel. I have stayed at the continental a total of four times - the last one on my Easter break this year- and I must say it is a great hotel. The client on the previous review must have had very bad luck on the dates they went. I have never came across another hotel offerning 24-hour breakfast buffet and free drinks. The decoration reminds me very much of the American style, which made us feel like home. You cannot expect luxury, like at the Sheraton or the Hilton, as I have read in one review, that's true, but all in all, it is a decent, clean, hotel with an awesome location and very service-minded staff. Las Ramblas balconies will always be noisier, but it also depends on the events going on in town and the time of the year.

<Content>Great Little Place, by NO means luxury! I stayed at the Hotel Continental for 1 night in August of 2005 after a cruise.We did not get a room with a balcony, because of the noise on Las Ramblas. The room was not the best, and those seeking luxury accomidations will be disappointed. By American standards I would say that this hotel is below (in rating) than a Hilton or a Sheraton. However, if you are looking for an average room in THE BEST location, this is your place!The continental breakfast was there all day, with a few extra items earlier in the morning. There were hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, juice, cereals, coffee, danishes, fruits, milk. I LOVED the hard boiled eggs (since in the US the food often lacks flavor, these were the best eggs I've ever had!!). Also free drinks and beer was available.The location was amazing, like I mentioned before, and once you step out of the front door, you are on a street that never sleeps. It is in the middle of everything.The staff was very nice and friendly. I would stay there again, no question. Besides, when you are in a city as wonderful as Barcelona, who needs a room for anything more than just sleep! There is so much to see there!!

We had a problem while being in Rome with a strike so our flight to Barcelona was cancelled, we tried other ways but couldn't get to Barcelona on time, so we let the hotel know and after a few emails they agreed not to charge us for the night!. That is some customer care service!, we had a terrible day in Rome, and they understood that!, we hadn't get to the hotel they already had show interest in the customer, that is something!Definitely stay with them!

<Content>overbooked Despite having booked six months in advance ( and confirming our reservation two days before) we arrived to find no room was available. We were given a suite at the sister hotel the Palacette, which was probably superior to the room we would have had, but as we had made our original choice based on location we were disappointed. The staff were very apologetic , however I wondered if we had been moved to accomodate a longer booking (ours was for just one night). I would book again on my next visit to Barcelona as they did upgrade us to make up for it and everyone is entitled to one mistake

The rooms are quite eccentric but clearly adorable with a cute balcony overlooking Las Ramblas. Because of the completely FREE 24 buffet, tea/coffee you can retire to your room at any point day or night and sit outside with a drink overlooking all the action. There is also a fridge and microwave in your room so you can keep wine/beer and heat up the odd snack that you have bought at the FABULOuS local market. The decor is different but we adored it and the room has everything you could possibly want. The location is amazing . You are right in the midst of everthing. Just Grrrreat!

The employees were not only helpful, but very friendly as well. The buffet was available 24 hours a day. The location of the hotel couldn't be better; right at the top of La Rambla. We were in and out of the building many times in the 24 hours we were there and never encountered any pickpockets. Hotel Continental also offers free wireless internet and it worked great. We highly recommend this hotel!

The staff is very nice though and that is the only good thing I can say about the place. The location I guess is good but it is very noisy and lots of gypsys and pickpockets here. We tried to eat at an upscale sidewalk cafe and were hit up 5 times for money from middle eastern women carrying babies. You have to yell at them or they just stand there at your table and will not leave. If we ever returned to Barfelona we would stay by the beach.

<Content>Great hotel! I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, together with a friend of mine.We really liked the location from the hotel, you can overlook the Rambla when you have a room with balcony and the hotel is 2 minutes away from the Metro Catalunya. Also Place de Catalunya is about 5 minutes away,it is a very nice place to go shopping. Also the harbour is about 2 metro stations away, here you can have a wonderful diner at the harbour.The rooms are very old-fashionable but they are clean and that's most important we think. Also the beds are very comfortable.The breakfast-buffet is very good and offers a lot of things, you can have toast, jam, eggs, apples, oranges, kiwi's, all kinds of coffee, hot chocolate,tea, little croissants, muffins, cornflakes, muesli, orange juice.It was very good and we would definately stay there again!

<Content>Without doubt the worse hotel I have ever seen! We were a small party of 4 women on a weekend break to Barcelona, looking for a pleasant hotel to stay whilst we took in the delights of this fabulous city. I guess we should have been alarmed when our taxi driver from the airport questioned our choice of hotel but that didn't prepare us for the shock that followed! The entrance into the hotel was almost enough to make us turn away however we had made the reservation and so we persevered - we were greeted by a fairly pleasant member of staff at the reception desk. We followed the dark, dingy corridor to our rooms. Upon opening the door to our 'room' more like a cupboard with a bed in, we were horrified by the stench that wafted from within, the hideous decor and the complete lack of space (I was informed upon booking that the rooms were cosy - I didn't know that meant that aswell as sleeping in the bed we would have to store our cases on it and get changed whilst standing on it too). I didn't get as far as checking out the bathroom I had seen enough. We consulted our guide book and thank goodness for Le Meridien, they came up trumps with a deal for a late booking and we had 2 fabulous suites at that! We checked out without any hesitation - unfortunately costing us a few euro's. We all heaved a huge sigh of relief and went on to have a top time.

<Content>Location, Location, Location My wife and I stayed at the Continental for several nights at the end of February, 2005. I had read the tripadvisor reviews, especially those that complained about the poor state of walls, ceilings, furnishings, etc. Is this an antiseptic Holiday Inn? No. Instead, the hotel exudes character (Indeed, George Orwell recovered from his wounds in this hotel during the Spanish Civil War).  The hotel lobby is on the fourth floor and the rooms are on the fourth and fifth floors overlooking Las Ramblas just a skip off of the Plaza Catalunya. The Ramblas facing rooms have cozy balconies with room for a small table and two chairs. The doors were double-glazed and the hotel seems to be in the last stages of putting in air conditioning in all rooms - a necessity in the summer due to the street noise. Having a fridge in the room is a big plus and having beer, wine and a buffet available all the time is great. Complaints: my wife did not like the wall to wall carpets in the room. It was clean but old and very worn. the double bed was two singles moved together so there was no snuggling at night unless you don't need much room.

<Content>I can't understand the complaints A little advance planning would remove this hotel from those looking for modern posh surroundings. However, if you would rather soak in some authentic charm, at a great location, this is your hotel. Why complain about old wallpaper? Do you prefer stark tan modern walls? Why complain about plastic drawers? Do you prefer bulky room-taking furniture? This place is high- ceilinged, ergonomically state of the art, not an extraneous element. Even the bedside lamps are suspended from the wall, to leave more space on the nightstands (one, the top of the safe) for YOUR possessions. The rooms have microwave ovens and refrigerators, so a short shopping trip to the basement supermarket of El Corte Ingles (a block away) will stock you with good bread, cheese, ham, olives, whatever, and a 1-euro bottle of wine, beer or soda from the lobby fridge completes an excellent late afternoon break, as you sit on your balcony and watch the sun set over La Rambla. This is in addition to the complimentary snack bar, with coffee, tea, pastries, prunes, etc., which remains open all day after the included open-til-noon continental breakfast. Try to get a third-floor room which muffles the dog's barking and any lobby noise. P.S. The floral sheets suspended from the hallway ceilings are obviously hiding the wiring that makes the rooms so efficient. Get a life!

<Content>Trip Ruined We visited Barcelona in June, 2004 and stayed at Hotel Continental La Rambla.The Hotel was disgusting, very outdated, including very old and dark wall paper, a fabric was hanging from the roof in place of ceilings??? it was totally disgusting. It smells like an old book store, moldy.We had dreamed of this trip to Spain and worked real hard to save the money for it. Staying at this hotel ruined our days in Barcelona. The furniture is disgusting, they had old plastic patio chairs and a plastic container with drawers for your clothes in the rooms, the carpet was old. Discolored old blankets and beds made one worry about sleeping in them. The breakfast bar was disgusting, stale. We had to go and spend more money buying breakfast outside. We had a balcony room at first, then switched to a regular room, they did not let us see it in advance and when we got moved to it, it was so small that we had to close our eyes in the room so not to become claustrophobic. The bed was stuck against a wall on one side and enough to get your feet out of bed only on the other. We hated every minute of it. No air conditioning. Noisy. Positives, location, frienly front desk staff, eveything else negative.We will never return to this hotel again.We finally left and stayed at Hotel Medicis and loved it. Nice, updated, clean rooms, friendly service and at a great price, almost half the price, it is near the Sagrada Familia Church. We will return to Medicis and to beautiful Barcelona. The city is a jewel, we highly recommend it!

<Content>A nice little hotel We stayed at the Hotel Continental for 4 nights at the end of September 04, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our room was a good sized room with a balcony overlooking the Ramblas. Allthough it had a decor somewhat dated it was clean, and it was cleaned every day.The breakfast was OK and being able to visit for refreshments throughout the day was a plus point in our opinion. There was a tendancy to find the eggs somewhat undercooked a couple of mornings but this did not upset us as there are other items to fill you up.A major benefit is the central location of the hotel on the Ramblas just around the corner from Placa de Catalunya Square, very handy for the airport bus.Just sitting on your balcony having a drink of wine or beer watching the world go by and the sun go down was very relaxing, after a very busy day in this wonderful but hectic city. You really do have to get a balcony room to make the most of your stay at this quaint but dated hotel.

<Content>Good and bad points My girlfriend and I have just returned from four nights at the Hotel Continental in Barcelona. The Hotel reception is on the second floor of the building and can be reached by a small elevator which didn't smell too fresh. The reception area is a little shabby, but the staff are very friendly. Our room was just off the reception area and although we'd read about the outdated decor on this site, it really did come as a shock. George Orwell is said to have stayed here in the 30's - well, it looks like he picked the wallpaper and carpets because they've got to be that old at least. Despite being a balcony room with window over La Rambla, it was dark and dreary with a very musty smell. The bathroom also smelled quite badly and we discussed the idea of walking straight out and finding another hotel. We decided to stay and I have to say that after a while we did get used to the decor and once the room was aired it was quite comfortable and clean.Obviously we were prepared to deal with the noise of La Rambla, and this was reduced to a murmur when the balcony doors were closed, but noise within the hotel was bothersome at times because of the thin walls. Noise from the dining area which adjoined our room wasn't a problem, but the resident dog's barking at times through the night was. It's a big dog with a big bark and would be a problem for light sleepers. The worst noise problem became apparent when a couple moved in to the room next door on our last night. Let's just say that they enjoyed themselves frequently and loudly, and we were spared none of the details between banging headboards, enthusiastic vocalisations and creaking bedsprings. This means that the hotel might not give you the privacy required if you want to either be shielded from the shenannigans of others or get up to your own.Although the hotel has some serious negative aspects, there are some very good points which made our stay there very enjoyable despite the bad points. First and foremost is the location which simply couldn't be better. Placa de Catalunya, the hub of the city, is only a few yards away with the Hard Rock Cafe, Corte Ingles and the Metro station within a minute or two's walk. Being able to make a convenient pitstop at your hotel from running round the city all day is a huge advantage. Then, of course, there's La Rambla itself with all it has to offer.The other major plus point is having the balcony room. It was so good to sit with a cold beer or two at the end of a hectic day and watch La Rambla going about its business. The provision of a buffet and the chill cabinet full of reasonably priced beer are also nice touches.On balance, I don't think the Hotel Continental was particularly good value for money. While certainly not the most expensive hotel, the Ramblas rooms aren't bargains either. If the hotel were in any other location it would be horribly over priced given its antiquated decor and limited facilities. The Hotel Cortes, which is just around the corner, has almost as good a location with a much better environment and at a better price. There are any number of hotels nearby that would be better quality at a lower price. I guess it just depends how much that balcony on La Ramblas is worth to you. For us, it just about made it worthwhile putting up with the negatives.

<Content>Great Location, Bad Eggs and noisy. We stayed in the Continental in November 2003 and thought it was good for the price. Standards have seemed haved slipped when we returned October 2004.The room rate is good, but we found the hotel very noisy. This was noise from the hotel and not the Ramblas. We had to buy ear plugs to get a good sleep.Then the breakfast was disgusting. Bread had mould and the eggs were rotten.Staff are great and will help when they can. Get a balcony room if you can because the other rooms are too dull and stuffy.Best location on the Ramblas. So a mixed review, but OK if you get a balcony room and miss the breakfast.

<Content>Enjoyable time at the Hotel Continental A very good hotel for the money had four nights there the staff were very helpful, the room although not much to look at was clean. We had a room over looking the Ramblas it was very noisy on our last night as the festivals were on. Breakfast was enough and you could go back time and again for as much as you liked and coming back after long walks around Barcelona free coffee and snacks. All in all really good value for money. Would recommend it to anybody.

<Content>Great hotel We had a great time staying at the Hotel Continental. The location is absolutely ideal along La Rambla, and the staff is friendly and helpful. Having a balcony was fantastic for people watching, relaxing in the sun, and having breakfast. The only down side was that there was no air conditioning; however, they were in the process of having A/C installed in the rooms. La Rambla could be a little noisy at night so having the windows closed could be necessary. The hotel is also very conveniently located to several metro stops.

<Content>Great! This hotel is groovy!It's locating is ideal, and most ideal for Spain: no cucarmargas! The best rooms are the Ramblas rooms, with a magnificent view over the famous Rambla.I went their in august and had a room at the back and that was a little hot, but if you choose a Ramblaviewroom you've got enough fresh air to cool the room.The staff is friendly, there's a good all day buffet and the hotel is groovy decorated!And it is clean and next to the metro and the airportbusstop.If your looking for a clean and funny hotel for not such high prices this is a good hotel!Enjoy your travel to the great city of Barcelona!

<Content>On the street Several of us visited the Continental for the MotoGP. We booked it based on its location and price and so were expecting what we got, a basic hotel but ideal location at a reasonable price. My tip would be to ask for a room with a view of La Ramblas. You may have to put up with extra noise, but the rooms are larger and less claustraphobic than the inner room we had. I'd imaging when the temperature is high, the inner rooms can be mighty stifling too, especially with smelly motorcycle kit.With all the nightlife available, being a night owl would help, early to bed and the noise would be intrusive. There's a great bar and tapas venue directly opposite and early Saturday evening, see if you can find the dancing in the square on the street parallel to Las Ramblas on the church steps.Expect shabby chic and the Continental is fine at the price.

<Content>Perfect location, perfect stay! If you're looking for a spacious suite and stunning decor, you're not going to get it here. If you are looking for a perfectly functional room with a fantastic, convenient location and a fun view, then this is it. We loved staying here! The rooms were comfortable and clean. We loved sitting on our balcony in the evenings and mornings, watching the street performers, drinking wine (evenings) or with coffee and pastries. Wonderful! Prices were the most reasonable in Barcelona too!

<Content>Super hotel and staff We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The staff was super, helping in every way they could. We had many questions and they always took time to help us. Our room was large and very pleasant. Yes, we faced the Ramblas and loved it, noise and all, way into the nite. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful. And being able to enjoy their delicious coffee 24 hrs a day was definitely a plus for us. The dining room was very comfortable and the guests staying more than one day--we stayed for three days--were always friendly.If you want a nice place to stay, try this hotel. I understand the rooms facing the Ramblas are larger, so try them. You'll love it.

<Content>Continental grew on us Funky, clean, great location and grows on you.We spent four nights at the Hotel Continental La Rambla in June 2004. Location is ideal for anyone wanting the excitement of La Rambla. Everyone at the front desk was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was fine and we appreciated that we could get coffee and snacks during the day. Also appreciated that hotel has a cooler with water, Cokes, beer and wine for sale all for what appeared to be no markup whatsoever. Hotel itself, furniture, decor is funky but it is clean and the price was right.We would stay here again.

<Content>Great Location We stayed in this Hotel at the end of November 2003 and found it to be in a very convenient location. The rooms were quite small and the shower was one of those over the bath and could be a pit unpredictable! We had a room at the back of the hotel and on some nights could hear a dog barking through to the small hours, so I would reccomend trying to get a room overlooking the Ramblas. The staff spoke English and the rooms were clean and cosy. Overall it was good value for money, compared to some other hotels in Barcelona and very convenient.

<Content>Ideally placed This Hotel is ideally placed in the centre of Barcelona at the top of the Ramblas and 1 minute from the Placa Catalunya. We visited in November.The room we had was quite small and although there was a window, it looked out onto a wall. Some rooms have balconies onto the Ramblas but I wouldn't bet against noise pollution in high season. There is an electric insect screen to allow you to open the window during warm weather and although there's no aircon, there is a large fan in the ceiling to keep things cool-er. The bathroom had standard fittings and the bath/shower was powerful and there was plenty of hot water, ideal after walking long distances around the city centre. The staff were helpful and the continental breakfast and all day tea/coffee facilities were as good as anywhere but there were no bacon, eggs etc. as the buffet was cold. Generally this hotel was excellent value for money, we got rooms for 70 euro's a night by contacting the hotel direct on it's website which is also helpful for general information about Barca.

<Content>Great location, pity about the rooms! The situation couldn't be better for a first time visitor - at the Placa de Catalunya end of Las Ramblas within a five minute walk of the airport shuttle bus, the tourist information office and the Bus Turistic stop. We spent time on our balcony in the evening after a day's sight-seeing, watching the people on the Ramblas below and drinking wine - largely to avoid being in the room! The wallpaper has to be seen to be believed, covered with large hunting scenes in pink and green complete with packs of hounds, prancing horses and stags at bay! The hotel has obviously seen better days and we couldn't think when or how it got its 3* rating. The public areas look run down; the carpets are dusty and threadbare and the ceilings throughout draped in busy, pink and green floral fabric - hung no doubt to conceal something unspeakable beneath! The attitude of the numerous reception staff was one of indifference. I don't think we saw the same one twice and barely achieved eye contact with any. Take some earplugs with you - the hubbub on the Ramblas is no-stop.
