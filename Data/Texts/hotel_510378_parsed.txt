<Content>freezing cold, washer/dryers broken right now I am at the Gaylord Suites - my fingers are numb - it's very cold outside and their boiler goes on only when scheduled - no matter the temperature - the front desk tells me I have to wait another hour before it's due to come on again. Laundry facilities are broken most of the time - they'll eagerly send you down the street into one of the most disgusting laundromats you've ever seen.The staff is friendly but they can't make up for the freezing rooms and the inconvenience of the broken laundry.

<Content>Mixed feelings I have mixed feelings about the Gaylord Suites.We had great, friendly service from an African-American man, but a consistently icy reception from a dark haired woman - she never looked up or smiled at us, was very reluctant in her dealings with us, and was obviously disinterested in us (but not blatantly rude).The rooms are very nicely decorated, but are noisy at night (streetnoise, sirens), possibly this is just more noticeably because the windows are not double glazed. I wore earplugs every night (front desk were more than happy to move us to a quieter room when we asked, but the new room was unfortunately no quieter, as it was next to the elevator). Light from the hallway shone brightly all night into the room.We had a few maintenance / hygiene issues in both rooms. The flooring was buckled by the bathroom door, and we kept tripping and hurting ourselves until we jammed toilet paper into the gap to remind us not to walk over that piece. The blanket on the chair smelt strongly of body odour and was visibly dirty. There was dried blood on the duvet inner (the cover was clean). There was no plug for the kitchenette sink, but front desk said they would lend us one if we wanted. In our first room the bath plug was broken and had masses of long hair around the base of it, which I very reluctantly had to clean off to try and fix it. Maintenance came to fix it the next day, they were very efficient.Great location, a few blocks from Union Square.We did not have an *awful* experience here, but it was too flawed to recommend to anyone. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Gaylords suites are amazing My friend and I stayed here for the summer. It was brilliant, all the employees are so friendly and all so helpful. The rooms are lovely and cosy but yet very spacious and so clean. So near union sq. Would most definately stay here again when we return. Loved it. Made our holiday in San francisco.

<Content>Great location, nice, clean and cozy rooms We enjoyed our staying here. We were in SF for a conference and stayed in the hotel for 8 days. It felt like home. Internet was available at no extra charge, room was cleaned daily.The only issue I can remember was that 2 times there was no hot water from 8 am till 6pm, but since you're out through the day and take a shower in the evening, it was no problem for us.I would recommend the hotel, as it's in the wakling distance to the Union square.

<Content>Friendly, recently renovated, highly recommended Stayed here for a week during June. The hotel had some okay reviews, but wasn't really expecting much. We arrived to a recently renovated serviced apartment building with large rooms and friendly staff.Well located, however as many have noted, make sure you turn left on the corner and head for union square, as there is an unsavoury section of San Francisco a couple of blocks down the hill - however don't let this put you off staying here. The hilton is right next door to the same dodgy area - its just the way inner San Francisco is.Rooms were nicely decorated and fitted, and the rates were amazingly cheap. High speed internet was included for free (yay!) and we were able to park our hire car out the front temporarily which was great.I would definately stay here again. Its in a great location, has nice rooms, comfy beds and is cheap. What more do you want?

<Content>Good stay at the Gaylord Really good room for an excellent price in San Francisco - especially excellent as the rates are weekly (or monthly) so they didn't go up even though there was a big conference in town. Hotel building was nice, lots of character and good laundry facilities (either coin or they have a delivery service). Room was large with good sized bed, kitchenette and bathroom. Style was very crisp and modern - cream/black and nice wooden floorboards. Bathroom was a bit old looking in comparison but clean and functional. Walk-in cupboard was massive and handy. Free internet if you have your own computer. Staff were a little young and surly, but so were we so it didn't bother us! Reception was manned 24 hours, felt secure. Maid service was weekly, but this was fine for us. I'm sure you could ask for more towels if you needed them. Only complaint was that after our room was serviced we had no toilet roll! Very strange. Hotel itself was in a good area, but walk down the same street and it's all a bit scary. San Francisco generally seems to be that way - one side of a street can be safe and the other side dangerous, weird. Only 5 minutes walk from Union Square where there is shopping and easy transport to other parts of the city. Overall, an excellent stay. Would stay again.

<Content>Poor Service I did not stay at this hotel, but I did have problems. I called to make a reservation, but being that I will have a car with my on my vacation I requested information about parking. The woman who answered my call wouldn't provide me with any assistance, claiming that she was unaware of the parking situation. When I asked to speak with someone more informed she rudely responded by stating that nobody on the premises knows. I refuse to believe that a hotel could run their business without knowledge of important information like this. I will look elsewhere.

<Content>Great Place to Stay When I was initially booking a hotel for my stay in San Francisco, I came on this website and was a little apprehensive about the Gaylord because of the reviews talking about construction noise. I decided to book with the hotel anyway because you can't beat the price and I am very glad that I did. I was out there on business and had to stay for 6 weeks. Many of my coworkers booked at other hotels and ended up paying 3 times more than I did. Sure, there is only weekly housekeeping, but how often do you change your sheets at home anyway? There was some construction noise in the beginning of January, however, it was only during the day and by the end of the month, the construction was complete.The staff is very friendly and helpful, the building is clean, and the price is unbeatable.If you really want to fee like you're in a true San Francisco Building, stay at the Gaylord.

<Content>Perfect comfort Firstly, the pictures on the Gaylord Suites (www.CITISUITES.com) site caught my attention, and secondly most of the reviews listed here seemed positive enough to go ahead and book for a week. I can honestly say I am very pleased that I did.Arriving straight from SFO international in a taxi was only 30 minutes at 4.15 p.m. so traffic was not heavy, and between myself and my two companions was only $50, with tip, very good. The entrance to the building feels very Nob Hill and the receptionist lovely. Check-in very smooth and then it was straight into functioning old elevators to my suite. I arrived at the third floor to a clean Hispanic-looking lobby and turned the key. Immediately I was impressed with the clean smell and the space for a single occupier or a couple. Exploring the delightful Art Deco tiled bathroom and small kitchenette leading onto a comfortable queen sized bed in a large living space, not to mention the wonderful walk-in closets, I felt quite at home. Super hot shower, large TV, and i-pod radio alarm clock, only added marks overall.Do not be put off by the negative comments because of the Tenderloin area, just turn left at the bottom of the street, Union Sq. 5 Minutes! I had no problems walking straight down Jones to Market St. if only to catch the tram out of town or to the Castro!Overall, an excellent location for walking around the city, shopping, dining and returning to lounge in comfort before doing it all again. Very secure building; no callers after 10p.m. I have been to SF quite a few times and have no hesitation in recommending Gaylord Suites for singles or couples. I am going back in July with friends to stay there again. If they keep up this standard, watch this space.Ian, Edinburgh.

<Content>Gaylord - great experience for the price I'd been looking for a business class hotel, but these were all booked up due to a conference. I checked TripAdvisor before booking and was a bit worried by some of the other comments to do with location, lack of hot water etc within Gaylord Suites. In fact, I had a positive experience - and the price really made this a bargain.Things to watch out for: There is building work going on, and - with due notice - the water is sometimes turned off. This won't affect you unless you plan to be in the apartments during the day time (as I was working 9-5 it didn't affect me). Location is on the edge of the tenderloin, but it's really central and once you don't walk down Jones street (away from Nob Hill) but rather along Geary towards Union Square, you're absolutely fine. The centre of most cities is likely to be slightly dodgy anyway - I didn't feel overly unsafe walking to and from Gaylord, even on my own at night. Streets are very lively, there are lots of people around etc (just that some of them are mad!)Cheap, nice, clean comfortable rooms, functioning, free internet access. If all this appeals, go for it!

<Content>Gaylord October 2007 Overall our stay at the Gaylord Suites was a good one. The room was clean, staff were friendly and the price was good. However there were a few things I wished I had known before booking the hotel. It isn't a hotel really just a rented apartment, the maid service is once a week but if you can make do with the same towels and bed linen that long you shouldn't be too put off by this, the room and bathroom was nice and the bed was very comfy. The gaylord isn't in Nob Hill as advertised, it's further down, right on the edge of the tenderloin which isn't a very nice area. We had no problems but I wouldn't have felt safe on my own at night. The location, however is ideal for access to union square, all the shops and there is a BART station nearby (about a 10 minute walk).The building work is still going on as mentioned in other reviews but as early risers it didn't bother us once. It does, however, get quite noisy sometimes as early as 8am. Notices are put up well in advance if they need to turn the water off and it's usually between around 10 and 5 during the day when you would be out and about.The staff are than willing to help with any questions/problems you could have and sorted us out with a limo to the airport for a very reasonable price. All in all, a positive experience.

<Content>Go for it I'm writing this from my lovely 3rd floor corner room (310, ask for it). I'm in the midst of a 3 week stay while working in San Francisco. I stay in hotels 52 weeks a year as I am on tour (I'm a musician). This hotel is undergoing a complete renovation that is almost finished. No big renovation noise. Street noise is a problem for those looking for a quiet stay. As this hotel is on the border of the tenderloin, it's a bit noisy outside, but very quiet inside.Pluses: Laundry in the building. First rate front desk staff. GREAT room (windows that open, new hard wood floors, microwave, fridge, comfortable bed, walk in closet, awesome water pressure).Negatives: This is the exact block where the tenderloin intersects with Nob hill money. Down the hill, VERY BAD. Up the hill ,VERY GOOD. 24/7 front desk staff negates the bad part of the equation as one must be buzzed in to the building (visually). Downhill on Jones is REALLY bad, but can be overcome by walking a few blocks.Overall: Great place. Nice renovation. Beautiful building. I'll stay here again.

<Content>Had to call the state atorney to get my security deposit back This was a miserable experience. The windows in my room didn't shut, I was so sleep deprived from the noise (yes I wore earplugs every night) that I ended up in the hospital. The cleaning service threw away the food I had purchased and place in the kitchen section (a sink and a mini fridge in the hallway). The water was shut off about 3 times a week during prime showing hours. After leaving I didn't get my secuity deposit back. I called and left over 10 messages with this manager...hum...she didn't really know much what was going on except how to ignore all calls, and never be in the office. 2 months later after filing a lawsuit with the State Department I am supposedly getting my security in the mailOh yeah and my car was vandalized (yes I had to make a police report) and someone was shot across the street when I was walking into the apartment. If that isn't enough of a deterant go by the area for 5 minutes. It is very sketchy!!!!

<Content>Good Place To Stay I am just finishing-up my stay here at the Gaylord and thought I would make a few comments...My room was nice, and besides the normal noise of the City, I didn't hear any of the so called construction noise. Being a traveling nurse, one who sleeps during the day, room noise is very important to me and again, I didn't have any problems.The staff is nice. It is rare that a place has all genuine people working behind the desk. People who will talk to you as you're picking-up your mail, and take a real interest in you. The building is beautiful. Walking into this lobby always brightens me up.Who's the guitar player? Some guy, a bad version of Seal, sits in front of the building and plays guitar. It's horrible, I wish someone would tell him the truth and tell him to keep his day job.Overall, I was looking for a nice place at a good value, and in the Gaylord I definetly found it. I'll comeback for certain. - Laurie of Norfolk, VA

<Content>HORRIBLE -- AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! If you delight in overpriced rooms in a VERY shady area of SF, frequent water shut-offs, loud sirens, and RUDE staff, well, by all means book a room here.Website (and manager on phone) makes building sound like a historic and quaint place to stay. Far from my experience!!!Learned while guest there that owners are being sued by City Attorney for numerous violations.Can you say Bad Karma?

<Content>Love this place! I am staying at the gaylord at the moment and think it is absolutely fantastic. The room is nicely decorated, and I can't praise the comfort of the bed enough! Fluffy pillows and a huge duvet make for a great night's sleep! It comes fully equipped with microwave, fridge and freezer, cutlery etc. The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is because the room is slightly smaller than I expected and you can hear a bit of traffic from the rooms closest to the street. As for the neighborhood, the hotel is located in the theater district, and while it is adjacent to the tenderloin neighborhood the area is easily avoided. The hotel is in great proximity to union square and all its restaurants and of course, the theaters, which are fantastic (only five minutes from the half price theater ticket booth in union square too). The Gaylord is highly recommended and I intend to stay here again!

<Content>If I Could Turn Back Time Arriving in San Francisco expecting to fill my hard earned free time with fun. I couldn't have been more wrong.The first morning in my newly rennovated suite I was rudely awakened at 8 am by the sound of, surprisingly, suites being newly rennovated. An event which proved to be routine through the entire course of my stay.Hoping to rinse away the remainder of my exhaustion, I was hoping to cure with sleep, I stepped into the shower. Only unbenonsed to me , the hot water had been shut off, I must admit by this time I was slightly less than surprised. This occured several days throughout the course of my stay. After a while I actually found myself pleased to have something as simple as warm water to shower in.Attempting to escape my vacation hideaway was a quite a chore itself. The common areas of the building were daily obstruced by construction materials, workers, and quardened off areas with neatly posted paper signs apologizing for the inconvenience : {A gesture which, to me, added insult to injury.As the last week of my stay approached I found myself preoccupied with attempting to recieve any sort of compensation for my disasterously dissapointing stay. An effort which not at all surprising, proved to be fruitless.By the end of my , and I use this term loosely, vacation. I found myself counting down the hours until I could return to the reliability, peace, quiet and compfort of my home.

<Content>An absolute disaster It isn't everyday that the amenities of your hotel feature multiple water shut offs during your stay,always present noise at decibel levels inside the building and on the street that are like spikes through your temples, and assortments of charachters in your lobby and outside your front door that you walk across the room or street to avoid. But it's all here in this disaster of a hotel that more closely resembles the homeless shelters in the next block.The hotel should really have shut down completely during the renovations, but they did not, nor was there any indication upon making our reservations for our stay that there would be any renovations going on, which is probably the least forgivable of all.Once the renovations are over this might become an acceptable alternative to the higher priced boutique hotels around the corner, but until then stay far far away.

<Content>Dreadful -- AVOID New owners renovating, so expect loud banging from 8AM - 5PM. Water off for 6 hours three times during my month stay. A lot of friction between management and tenants', which made for a very uncomfortable environment. Lobby not available due to painting/renovation. Hallway floors covered in plastic due to painting and renovation. Noticed quite a few building inspector violations posted. Quite a change from when I stayed there in 2004. Also, they now want $1750/month!!! Nice desk clerks, but AVOID this place!!!

<Content>New management, probably going to change prices I only gave this an average because of the price. They are a little higher then some of the other hotels in that same area. The shower in my unit never worked, and my window faced the courtyard, which gets pretty noisy even during the week. There's a loud bar just across the street swic2 or something like that. LOUD! But other then that, the area is ok, the staff is pretty good. But the new management is kicking out the old occupents, and raising the prices quite a bit. I thought they were kind of high before but I looked online and month to month there is now like 1350.00. I have found better rooms in that area for 1/2 the price.I probably should also mention that I can't hear anything from the other rooms. Built very sturdy. The very small refridgerator and small plug in cooker weren't of much use. But they may be putting in new ones, with the new changes.

<Content>Not the best, but great at what they do! I chose the Gaylord because I needed a place to stay in San Francisco for months until I became established enough in the US to find an apartment of my own. Other places were double the price, wanted first and last month's rent, or security deposits so The Gaylord's price and convenience were perfect. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly as well. Because of their downtown location evening noise was an issue. Lots of street noise day and night. The room itself was motel-like with a small kitchen sink, a hot plate and a bar fridge. They are located two blocks from the beautiful downtown shopping district (Union Square) and two blocks from the horrible homeless district (the Tenderloin) so make your walking destinations accordingly.

<Content>The Gaylord holds the record As my second choice for a place to stay in San Francisco, the Gaylord Hotel has outperformed my first choice, and I very highly recommend it, for value, customer service, and decor. A truly first class establishment, the Gaylord has outperformed many three star hotels, especially in the area of comfort. The building is extremely clean and comfortable, the location is perfect for events and business, and the staff are the most friendly and helpful people I have met during this visit to San Francisco. I could not imagine a better choice for lodgings in the area, and highly recommend The Gaylord for both business and pleasure travellers. My overall rating of this hotel is 10 out of 10.
