<Content>good stay at the Sheraton Just returned from a few days at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel has been renovated and the rooms are bright and clean. Convenient location, though quite touristy. The hotel is also huge- though only 4 stories, there seem to be hundreds of rooms on each floor and it took several minutes to walk from the elevator to our room. No big deal, but if travelling with someone that can't walk far, I would ask for a room close to the elevators. The only reasons I don't give it 4 stars are the cost of the parking ($50/day) and the walls are a bit thin- we could hear the people in the room above us walking around.

<Content>Great location!! We stayed in the Sheraton for 4 nights together with our 2 kids ( 13 and 11 years old).The people in the hotel were very friendly and helpfull and were a great help for us to give us directions to the touristic things to do.We did a tour with Toad tours which they booked for us, we really enjoyed that.The room was very nice and the beds were great. The kids also liked the pool and the fireplaces at the terraces and the pool...very cosy at night.The best thing was the location. It was a five minute walk to fishermans wharf and Pier 39..al the great locations were within walking distance. Next year we definitally will go back to this hotel.

<Content>Business at the Beach This was about my 30th visit to San Francisco and initially for a business trip. Later in the trip, my family came and we had two rooms. So I will review three rooms and two different aspects.As a business hotel, this is a little out from downtown and I do not usually stay in this area. SF is not a place to have a car, and a $24 Muni week pass is a far better deal than the parking charges here. You are also advised to take BART into town for ca. $5, but I guess there is a shuttle from SFO for under $20. To get downtown, one can take the cable car, which is neat, but seemed unreliable the rather cold week I was there. The tram, surprisingly, was not on schedule much either. A few blocks away is the #30 Stockton bus, fast and reliable. They looked to have nice buns in the lobby in the morning but I usually just made a coffee in my room, then dashed. Another 'business' aspect is that free wireless is available only in the lobby. My room in this portion was in the 'annex' and faced the street but was quiet.My next room was a king-bedded unit facing the pool, also quite good and quiet. It adjoined a double unit at the end which my kids used. Although close to the street, little traffic noise was heard.The pool was cool in temprature although we did see one family use it and seem to enjoy it. The location was great for the touristic side of the trip. Even a better deal than a Muni Pass is a $59 City pass, if you plan to visit more than one attraction and use the cable cars.

<Content>A lovely hotel in an ideal location! This hotel is gorgeous! A recent refurb according to the website which prompted us to book it. Comfortable beds, plasma tv, tastefully decorated, we were so glad we booked it. It is also in an ideal location. Minutes away from pier 39. A 10 minute walk from Chinatown  Little Italy ( I recommend you go to both for a meal!)  again just a 10 minute stroll to pier 35 where you go for the boat to Alcatraz. This was our last stop on a fly drive trip starting in LA but we found that we didnt need the car once we got here as you can also get the trolley car close by down to Union Square (great shopping!)  Nob Hill. If you do have a car they DO NOT use the hotel car park, they charge $50 a night parking! Ridiculous! Hence another reason we got rid of the car early. If you are keeping your car then there is a secure car park which is half the price. (Leave the lobby, turn left  its across the road). Another down side was the charges for the telephone in the room. I had to use it  even though the call was international, it lasted 1 minute  was charged $24! A second call was charged  $40 for 3 minutes. When i rang reception to query the charges I was told thats the price. Upon checking out I mentioned this again  the charges were reduced to $20 total  he didnt even query it! I would stay here again without a doubt!

<Content>Excellent Hotel and excellent location!!! I stayed at the Sheraton Wharf in November with my wife, mum, dad, brother and his partner. To sum the hotel up in one word I'd use................BRILLIANT!!!!!!!The location of the hotel was great. It was very close to Pier 69 and also the beginning of the Tram line. Getting about was so easy.The hotel has a nice bar with a great outside seating area with open fire tables.Now on to the most important part, the rooms. The rooms were absolutley brilliant. They were very clean and very modern. We had 2 double beds and and a nice TFT TV. The decor was very bright and fresh and the bathroom had everything you need and again was of a high standard. It looked like the hotel had not long since been updated and the rooms were perfect.I seriously can't speak highly enough of this hotel. If you're looking for some where to stat in San Francisco then make it this hotel, A+++++++

<Content>We loved the hotel! fabulous We own timeshare with Starwood so were booked on the starwood preferred guest card.We were delighted with proximity to everything in san francisco. It took us 2 minutes to get to the harbour with views of alcatraz, the golden gate bridge and of course the piers.We had a meal on the first night of our stay and were definatley not disappointed. Our room was immaculate, bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the toiletries were great. There was starbucks coffee in the room, plasma television, great wardrobe space, good view, the fire pits outside were great to sit at and as smokers, we were delighted to have a cig or two there with other guests whilst having a drink from the bar.The only fly in the ointment was the deposit held on our credit card. It appeared to be 拢100 for each night of our stay. This meant that 拢400 was held on my credit card and had still not been released a week after arriving back in the UK. I have emailed starwood about this and am expecting a reply shortly.Otherwise, this hotel has everything you need. Its brilliant

<Content>Great location, ok hotel My husband and I stayed one night at this hotel in December 2008. The hotel is clean and is about as close to Fisherman's Wharf as you can get. It's a convenient location for being a tourist and walk to the wharf, Little Italy or Chinatown. They have refurbished the hotel since the last time we stayed there about 3 years ago. The old decor was some kind of dark hued 1970's fisherman's theme. Now it is in white with splashes of teal and pastel hues - I guess they moved up to the 1980's. It's an improvement as it makes things look a little brighter and cheerful, but it also reminded me of one of those home improvement shows where they only had a $100 budget to redecorate the room. Beds are comfy, flat screen HD TV is nice. Bathrooms are tiny.For Starwood members, there is no longer a club lounge and no complimentary breakfast like there used to be. We were informed though that there was a buffet breakfast for ~$21 each morning. We were going to give it a try but while waiting to be seated, I peeked at the buffet to see that it was little more than a chafing dish of runny-looking scrambled eggs, some fruit and pastries. And yes, parking is ridiculously priced at ~$50/night at the hotel.

<Content>Cool funky hotel in great location I really liked this hotel. The room was modern and funky and the bed was amazingly comfortable. There was a great HD TV in the room. The only niggle was that the bathroom was very small, but then you don't go to this wonderful city to spend a lot of time in the bathroom. There are some really nice sitting areas outside the hotel with nice relaxing flames - a perfect place for a drink after a day of seeing the sights.

<Content>Good locatio The location is good, close to pier 39 and to the cable cars stop. The room was ok with comfortable beds. The car parking is very expensive 49$ per night . We felt that it was a rip off and they should have reduced the rate for hotels guests. There is a public car park near by that charges 25$ per night. Not sure that we would stay there again.

<Content>Ok hotel in pricey San Francisco Stayed here recently with my other half. Found alot of the hotels in San Fran to be pricey. The hotel and room is very modern. It was comfortable, but there is a dodgy green/blue colour in the room which makes it feel cold. Parking is not complimentary, and is approx $50 a day in hotel car park. I would recommend to go accross the street to a public park, which is about $25 for 24 hours parking. Wifi was not free either in the rooms. The staff were not particularly over friendly either. They just did their job, and really didn't put anything extra into their work.

<Content>Ridiculous Hotel I am a frequent hotel guest for Sheraton/Westin/W and this by far was the worst stay in my life. The location was not bad, really accessible to Pier 39, The Embarcadero and North Beach. The HDTV was nice and the room was nice. But that wasn't enough to make our stay any pleasant at all. The minute we got there and was informed that the daily parking was $43 plus tax. Turned out to be $49 a night just for parking. That was pathetic. I've never parked anywhere in san francisco where parking was over $30. This ruined everything. I don't know, it didn't seem like the parking fee caused any complaints. I just wanted word out to whoever is going to make a future booking here, to be aware of the close to $50 daily parking fee. This was BS.

<Content>Very disappointed As for the hotel room, I would give it a 2 for value but their customer service is lousy so it gets a one from me. It took 4 phone calls to get them to hold the room for a late arrival and still it wasn't on their record when I checked in. I also had problems checking out and getting any helpful information from staff during my stay.The hotel itself has an antiseptic feel. Nothing really to separate it from any other hotel except that it's more expensive. There are plenty of better and less expensive places to stay in the Wharf area. I was very disappointed.

<Content>Very disappointed in "upgrade" My husband and I spent one night at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf in October 2008. We had also stayed at the property 6 years ago. Apparently the hotel was upgraded since we last visited, but in our opinion the upgrade was a drastic downgrade. The hotel has lost its classy feel of a Starwood property. I think the look they were going for was somewhat of a modern beach feel, but it ended up seeming cheap and poorly done. The room was comfortable and the bed was excellent but all in all it definitely was not worth the price. The brunch was terrible-poor selection and the quality of food was worse. The coffee was bitter-I like a strong coffee, but this was beyond strong! The hotel does have a great location-1 block off of Fisherman's Wharf piers, and it's great to leave your car there while you walk around the area. I guess I just expected the excellence that Starwood properties are known for....and its gone!We won't stay there again.

<Content>Stay well away from this one... Although this hotel has been refurbished, it's still at its heart a very sad business hotel. For the price, find somewhere else! The one positive thing I will say is that the beds and linen were comfortable, clean and new. To begin with, the service was slow and unfriendly. The rooms (we tried a few) had no double glazing (the windows missed out on the refurbishment) and since most rooms either look onto a court yard open to the road, a court yard with hotel ventilation equipment or directly onto the very busy roads, anything nearing a quiet room was hard to find. Air conditioners were ancient, unsightly and took up a good portion of the room - diminishing what would otherwise have been reasonably decent modern decor (if bright contrasting colours is your thing.)Pool area was small, uninteresting, right next to the road and pretty much only useful for getting wet rather than relaxing.Valet parking was very expensive - even for SFO. There was a large parking garage right over the road, so self-parking may be much cheaper.The area too was uninteresting, tired and aimed squarely at tourists. It sported pretty much middle-of-the road, overly-priced restaurants and shops selling nothing you'd ever consider buying at home. Rather get a hotel in a another part of the city and visit Fisherman's Wharf (if you must) by bus/cable car/foot.

<Content>new and improved It's been 1.5 year since our last visit, hotel is completely remodeled, and rethemed. Its casual, colorful, and comfortable. Has a beach theme that would be very popular with families and tourists. Lots of red yellow white and blue.  It was an overall pleasurable place to stay.  The bathroom was a bit small, but clean and updated. The bed was big and comfortable. The location is the best.

<Content>Good hotel. Great Location! We stayed in the hotel for three nights in the beginning of October. When we got the room we were very surprised to see that it was identical to the room that is shown it the web site, which is very nice (usually the rooms are similar but not as nice).The room itself was quite big, but the shower and bathroom were very small.The location of the hotel is fantastic! You walk easily to any place you need.The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. They helped us find great restaurants (not the ones in the pear) and we enjoyed every second of the hotel.The only thing that was disappoint, and I see it a lot in the different reviews, is the parking price. $50 a day!!!!!!!!!! It is a rip-off. Even in Manhattan you will pay much less!!! Doesn鈥檛 make sense that they charge so much.I will recommend this hotel to anyone that comes to San Francisco. Will be back there next time for sure!

<Content>It looks better online We recently stayed here for 3 nights and it was disappointing to say the least. I am a Starwood Preferred Member and this was probably the worse experience I have ever had at any of their properties. Their 鈥榮ervice鈥?is sub par, the rooms and atmosphere is blas茅 and nothing truly nice or extraordinary. I actually found the room to be much smaller than I expected and it was a huge disappointment. I was debating staying here or at the Argonaut at the Cannery which both had similar pricing for the dates we were staying and I was kicking myself that I had chose the Sheraton. The location was good but that鈥檚 really the only thing going for it, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned this is an older hotel, but according to the Sheraton website they just spent $33 million renovating this hotel. Um, I don鈥檛 know where the $33 million went, and if this is after the renovation I would hate to have seen what this place looked liked prior to the renovations. To top everything off they also charge $43 a day to park your vehicle (valet or self park same price) and they add $7 tax on top of that $43 so you are really paying $50 a day to park 鈥?which is ridiculous especially when you are a guest of the hotel and you are already spending $400 a night to stay there (we stayed during Fleet Weekend). If I could do this over 鈥?I would not stay here. Good customer service does not exist here and for the money you could stay somewhere nicer and closer to more touristy attractions like the Cannery or Ghirardelli Square 鈥?which are all in walking distance to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf and Pier 39.

<Content>very nice but expensive This is a very nice hotel but no wow factor. everything was good including food, service, rooms etc. but nothing really stood out. Location is very near fisherman's wharf but fishermans wharf wasn't really that nice - it was very crowded and a bit trippy. The rest of san francisco is absolutely fantastic - we loved it!! If you want something a bit different to do Muir wood is about 20 minutes north by car and is very peaceful early in the morning and full of really big trees. To sum it up loved the city, liked the hotel next time we'll definitely try something in the centre.

<Content>Would not have found this if not for Trip Advisor. This was our final stop on a 4 night road trip. We requested 2 double beds per room with connecting rooms and that is exactly what we got. The Sheraton is an older building but very well kept and very clean. The only negative would be that you can hear people in the hallways and other rooms, but it really wasn't too noisy.All of the staff that we came across were friendly and helpful, giving us very good instructions to the places we wanted to see as well as correcting the location for the rental car that we need to drop off. A ride to the airport was easily and efficiently arranged.This was a very pleasant stay and we would happily stay here again.

We ate at the IHOP across the street which served a good breakfast at reasonable prices, the hotel its self was clean and modern, the staff were helpful and friendly even the ones we didnt tip! We would recommend it as a base to stay in the bay area. Cant comment on the food as we didnt eat there,much more choice and cheaper out in the town.

<Content>Great management staff, but the night wine bar staff has an attitude We stayed for a total of 4 nights, 2 prior to our cruise and 2 after. The check-in took all of 30 seconds and was a pleasure to deal with. The bell/concierge staff was absolutely the best. The rooms were very well kept and nicely appointed. The only real problem is street noise from the street cars and motorcycles. The hotel is fairly in the center of all attractions of the wharf and is easy walking walking distance from everything. The lady that is in 'Espressi' in the evenings has an attitude that is not in keeping with the rest of the staff. I had a billing question on check out. The manager handled it immediately and without question. Needless to say, when we go back to 'Frisco' we will stay at the Sheraton.

As we were staying 4 nights they put us on the 4th floor - we were told it would be quieter - we can't compare to the other floors but it was certainly quiet.The photos on the hotel website are accurate - recently refurbished, bright and cheerful.Only used the room as a base but very comfortable and a great TV.Little contact with staff but from what we had they were effecient and friendly.I'd use the hotel again - can't say more.

<Content>Its great position overcomes a few problems We arrived after the long trip from Australia feeling pretty tired. The first room offered was on the 4th floor (which would have been OK) overlooking the bus carpark which was not OK. A request to shift was not well received but a room on 2nd floor overlooking a coutyard was available. The room was comfortable, but the bathroom was very small. The airconditioner very large and noisy when running. Apart from the initial problem the staff were very helpful and pleasant. It was very busy and as a result the queue at breakfast was a bit slow as it is in a fairly small room.The main thing going for it is its position near Fishermans Wharf  not far from Cable Car terminals.

<Content>Loved the Location and the room! Stayed there for 6 nights in August. We were initially given a corner hotel room on the 4th floor facing the bus depot. For 3 nights we could not sleep well because of the noise of the buses pulling in and out of the depot in throughout the night despite the very comfy bed. Finally, we asked for another room on the inside which the front desk gladly accommodated. He upgraded us to a preferred spg member room which came with complimentary water, a bathrobe and additional toiletries. The room was of a good size, with modernized decor and furnishings, as per all the inside of the hotel. The outside of the hotel looked so much older than the inside. It was too cold to use the outdoor pool. We were able to use the fitness room which was equipped with several ellipticals and threadmills etc. The elliptical was great, and we enjoyed watching olympics on the machine while working out. I recall internet was $14.95 per day but if you sat in the lobby with your laptop there was a free wireless hotspot. There was a business centre with computers and printer by the lobby, but there was a charge to use it. Also, at times, I was able to tap on free wireless hotspot from a nearby hotel if I stayed closed to the window but the signal was shaky.All the hotel staff we met during our stay were very friendly. We returned our rental car when we got to the hotel, so did not have to pay the daily parking fee at the hotel.Thumbs up overall !

<Content>Wonderful Well... we choose to stay there at first because I had a lot of Starwood points to spend and we thought it was anyhow worthy to stay at a Sheraton without paying lot of money.At the end of the day I think that it was good to stay there even we were paying the due amount.we were at one of the top roof rooms (I, my husband and my seventeen daughter), a very clean room, bright, with a great window toards the inner court of the hotel. No noise at all.The lodging was really excellent and I would suggest to anybody to stay there.Just a complain about the price of the breakfast and the car parking.But as a matter of fact the location was great, it was easy to go to any place in San Francisco, by walk, car or by public transportation.We spent the most exciting 4 days of our US vacation.

I was a little irritated with being charged $43/night for parking but hey, this is San Francisco and everything is expensive.Our room was nice and clean. Nothing fancy, just a nice room. A few hotels were a little closer to the wharf but I my family just relished being a few blocks away from Pier 39.For a tour of the City, check out Mr. Toad's Model-T guide service.

Since it was on fisherman's wharf it was a bit cold. if you are going get sweaters. some of the hotel rooms had balconies. ours did. the breakfast is a bit expensive, but there are some restaurants near by. There is IHOP , which did have good food. overall, it was a good stay.

<Content>Small and Skinny 2 Adults and 2 children-12  9 for 2 nights in San Fran for a Giants game mostly. Our room - VERY small. 2 Double beds in a very small room. Not enough towels, even though they knew there would be 4 of us. I went to the front desk to see if we could get a larger room. Even though we were only staying for 2 nights it was going to get even smaller so I asked for a suite or a larger room - money was not an issue - just space. We moved to a larger room - Not a larger room at all just one that had a balcony-about 2 feet wide - WOW, you couldn't put a chair if you wanted to and the street below and a view of the Ramada windows next door. The suites were being cleaned - I said we would wait - they put us in the room anyways and said they would call - they never did. Parking I was told would be $43 for the 2 day stay - No it was $43 a day and they forgot to tell you there is a $6 a day parking tax so it really cost $49 a day. Trust me, I know how expensive parking in SF is but had I only been told it would have made it easier to take. Newly remodeled - maybe they should have left the maze out - very hard to get around/find your room/elevators/etc. The decor needed help that's all I can say about that. The room doors didn't even fit the frames - could see at night 1/4 of light all the way around the door frame. The really cool outdoor fire pits were really neat except most were either broken or out of gas - it was really cold when we went never got above 65 with rain and with all the smokers using them as an ashtray it was really gross. The one really good point was the staff was great and the location to Pier 39/Tours/Museums/Restaurants/Muni. This made it all better - almost. The time we had with family - priceless, the cost of the room a night - more than $275.00 - not priceless.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed here from 4th July for 3 nights.The first night we arrived there were fire works on the bay for the 4th of July celebrations which were good .The hotel is within walking distance of all the pier 39 attractions and only a cable car ride from union square.You can get the boat to Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz from very near the Hotel.We did not use the hotel restaurant as there were so many on pier 39 but it looked okay.The pool is small but it was never crowded.Would stay here again.

<Content>Beautiful Sheraton This Sheraton Hotel is a convenient choice if you'd like to be close to Pier 39. It is beautifully furnished...renovated just last year...and beautiful through out. Quiet, elegant hallways, very comfortable rooms. We've stayed here a few times, usually prefer other hotels in SF...due to area, not necessarily the accommodations at this Sheraton...which are fine. We prefer to stay away from Fisherman's Wharf, and on the occasion that we must stay at FW, prefer the area by the Hyde Street Pier, as opposed to Pier 39. However, this is a beautiful and spacious Sheraton, very comfortable with exceptionally professional staff. I highly recommend this Sheraton...if your preference is proximity to Pier 39.

<Content>Lovely hotel - shame about the room We stayed here for three nights. The location is ideal for Fisherman's Wharf. Dollar car rental have a location at the hotel so it was convenient to collect our rental car when we were leaving (although other companies are in the area) The public areas of the hotel are top quality, I particularly liked the outside seating with fires for warmth on a cold evening, although the smokers tended to monopolise them.We were disappointed with the room. If were staying longer and hadn't arrived late at night we would have asked for a change. The room, which had two queen beds, was small and very noisy from the in room air con and the various units outside the room window on a flat roof. If you're going to stay here ask for a look at the room and avoid rooms on level three which look inward.I would definitely return to Fisherman's Wharf but would probably try another hotel.

<Content>Fantastic San Fran I stayed at the Sheraton for 8 nights. The location is perfect, 3 mins walk to Pier 39. We had a ball. The staff were very helpful and friendly. As soon as we checked in they offered to book us a transfer to the airport for our return flight, a word of warning though...it's a shared transfer and if like us you get held up waiting on other sleepy heads you could be delayed for your flight-if we'd known this we just would've taken an earlier transfer. We had room service once, the food was fine, arrived to our room hot and rather quickly so no complaints there, but we preferred the I-Hop right across the street!!Rooms were very spacious but bathroom is quiet small. All in all we loved San Fran and would highly recommend the Sheraton to anyone who wants to be at the heart of the action

<Content>Only okay.... Just back from a 4 night stay in the Sheraton. I wasn't overly impressed with the hotel. It was a middle of the road type hotel. I understand it has recently been renovated and quite honestly, I'd hate to have stayed before it was done up! The reception area was lovely, the fire pits outside and location was spot on for walking to Fisheraman's Wharf. However, the noise in the bedroom was awful. We originally had a bedroom on the 3rd floor with 2 double beds (upon request). The floor creaked constantly from the person walking in the bedroom above. I was awoken shortly before 6am, having travelled late the evening before, with the noise of the people in the room next door. I would honestly say there was a whole family having a non-stop full scale conversation and I could hear it practically word for word. I was very tempted at 6.35am to knock on the paper thin wall, but by chance they left the room 5 minutes later. Not only did that family's noise keep me awake but there was the horrendous noise coming from the street also. The windows aren't even double glazed, so you could hear constant traffic and noise. I was going to ring reception at 6.20am and let them hear the noise from next door and the noise of a lorry which had its engine running outside my window for over 5 minutes but decided against it as I was just hoping to nod back to sleep. I then had the pleasure just before 7am of the person above me getting up and the floorboards creaking for half an hour and as luck would have it, housekeeping then went in to the room and I could even hear the hoover!! I asked politely at reception the next morning if the family next door had checked out, which they hadn't and the receptionist immediately asked me if I'd like to switch rooms and moved us to the 2nd floor there and then. This room as marginally better. There was a courtyard outside our window and the road was a little quieter. I couldn't hear anyone in the room next door but there was still a bit of creaking on the floorboards from the room above, but nothing as bad as the previous room. The whole corridor however was quieter than the previous room. As for the decor on the corridors, it's not great for your eyesight when you're jet lagged!!There was a good choice of places to eat in Fishermans Whart but my son isn't in to fish and the smell was a little overpowering walking around the Wharf at night. We walked to North Beach one night and ate in a smashing restaurant, worth the uphill walk!! We went to Chinatown another night, having done the hop-on-hop-off bus.From a personal point of view, I would much preferred to have stayed around Union Square. The Wharf was nice to see but a night or maybe 2 nights would definitely have been enough for me. My son adored his trip so I can't knock it completely. I have friends visiting San Francisco soon and I won't be recommending this hotel for them.

<Content>Great Location, Great Decor Stayed here during the torch relay that was supposed to go in front of the wharf. Love the modern beach decor. Some interesting people walking outside the hotel (who like to whisper racial slurs, but mix up the nationalities!) make it a little uncomfortable if you are not Caucasian, but for the most part it's a safe place to walk around. Takes a trolley ride from the BART to get to the hotel, which is pretty fun if you don't have a lot of luggage.

<Content>Fun Decor, Great location by Fisherman's Wharf Stayed here for July 4th weekend, 2008. Hotel is 4 story building, conveniently located right by Fisherman's Wharf. At check-in, they placed me in 4th floor King bed room. Decor is colorful and fun. Room included a 42 inch LCD tv and even offered a few HD channels. Parking was expensive at $43/night but that is pretty standard in cities like San Francisco. We were able to walk a couple blocks to get to Fisherman's Wharf - a great area to stroll around and browse the various seafood, shops, and views off the piers. We were able to get to Chinatown with a 15 minute walk. The two things I loved about this hotel - the breakfast buffet and the outdoor firepits. Outside there are several semi-private sitting areas, each of which included a firepit. We bought a bottle of wine and just chilled outside, a fantastic and cozy way to finish off the night. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was pleasantly surprising. They offered small personal frypans with cooked veggie omelettes and home fries. My gf got a strawberry yogurt parfait while I was scooping up the salmon lox with capers. There was plenty of the standard continental fare in addition to the fresh mixed fruits. We had two complimentary passes but I saw from the menu it was rather expensive at $22+ per person. I would recommend based on value, location, and the firepits!

<Content>Loved IT! My daughter and I stayed 3 nights here and LOVED IT. The staff was so friendly and when we needed something they replied immediately. Rooms are georgeous and super big and really clean. Not one problem with the room, washroom or staff. Only issue was the charge for wireless internet, they offer it free if you sit downstairs but in the rooms it was 15-20 per day. Parking was ok as they gave us a discount and we were prepared about the charges, so no shock. The morning buffet was delicious and worth the 19.95 per person. Good variety and fresh fresh SUPER fresh food.

<Content>Excellent Location Stayed for 3 nights at the end of June with husband and 2 kids. The location of the Sheraton is excellent for all Fishermans Wharf has to offer. Easy walk to pier 39 and to the cable cars. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. Check in was swift. Front desk staff pleasant. The firepits outside are lovely to sit around and have a drink. One downside of our visit was that there was only one elevator working, the other 2 were being renovated, so the wait for the elevator was long. We were on the 3rd floor and even took the stairs a few times as that was quicker. The decor of the hotel corridors is a bit harsh on your eyes, plenty of stripes on the walls and circles on the carpets. Would stay at the Sheraton again as I loved the location. Oh and parking fees are $43 a night!

<Content>Not bad. Good location, lovely renovated rooms. It was just too noisy. We had a room overlooking the drive, which had outdoor seating on it. They don't however close the outdoor seating area at night and so the noise continues. Ask for a room away from this and I couldn't fault this hotel. In room breakfast by the way not worth the money, although the service is very good.

<Content>Great location, great hotel! We stayed there for a couple of nights in June and wanted to extend for another 2 nights but the hotel was full. We then moved to another hotel in financial district. For those wanting to experience different sights of SF, I'd recommend combining stays in Fisherman Wharf and downtown, you would feel like visiting a completely new city in each. Sheraton FW is perfect for the touristy stuff that we did around the Wharf. We loved it. We rented bicycle to Golden Gate and Sausalito (highly recommended! - the best way to enjoy the city, and it's generally flat trail!). The hotel is so close to Pier 39, we could walk there to see the sea lions at very early in the morning when it's still quiet (before the place is packed). The hotel has nice designs, appropriate for the area, with bright colors. The room is spacious and comfy. Bathroom is rather small, but clean. There is 7/11 conveniently nearby to stock up for drinks and snacks. The hotel location is very close to tourist attractions yet it's secluded enough to have a quiet feel -- there is an outdoor fireplace in its restaurant that looks inviting but we didn't have the time to enjoy. We'll definitely choose this hotel again in the future!

<Content>Great Stay We stayed at the Shearton Fisherman's Wharf for 5 nights in June 2008. Overall the stay was great. Good sized rooms and location is convenient for North Beach. We asked for a quiet room and had one on the top floor, away from street noise. Rooms were clean and staff were efficient. We booked through Hotwire and had a good rate, which made the stay even more enjoyable.I would definitely stay at the hotel again and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Great location, good hotel Stayed for 5 nights at the Sheraton and had a good experience. Loved the location - lots of bus stops in the area too (don't be afraid to use the Muni...great public transit system and cheap too). We were a little disappointed that we didn't have a king size bed, but the room was very comfortable and everyone at the hotel was nice. I think for a change of scenery I would stay in a different part of the city next time, but I would definitely recommend the Sheraton to friends and family.

<Content>great! After dropping my kids at SFO for their honeymoon to Hawaii, we stayed at the Sheraton FW, we loved it, it is decorated with an aquatic theme. The rooms are fresh and relaxing. The lobby is swanky and reminded me of a W hotel lobby, very chic. On the bottom floor their are outside sitting areas in rattan with a gas fire pit that look like coffee tables. They are cozy and so inviting. We were always on the run and never got to enjoy that part of the hotel. The hotel is located in Fisherman's Wharf, near everything that exciting area has to offer. We went through Hotwire and got an excellent rate. You won't go wrong at this awesome hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel/Great Location Stayed for 3 nights in June 2008. Previously was there 6 times prior to the rennovations. We have always enjoyed our stays at this hotel. Pricey...Yea...but worth it for the location! There may be other properties for those on budgets, but if you want a bit more than the average chain, this ones for you. We never ate at the hotel, but did sit outside in front at the 'firepits' several evenings with a glass of wine. Great place to sit and relax. Rooms are updated, and it does have flat panel TV's..but to be honest, for the time we were actually in the room, we never turned it on! We too, asked for late checkout, however, the manager politely stated that they cannot honor that at this property, however, they would hold our luggage for us after we checked out (and had 4 hours before our flight left). They did hold our luggage, and were very courteous to us when we picked it up later to catch our shuttle back to the airport. I would recommend for over 20 somethings, and on up. Not much for kids to do at the hotel, so probably would stay somewhere else with kids. All in all, a very pleasant experience, and very relaxing.

<Content>interesting modern rooms If you want to be near the Fisherman's Wharf area this is probably as good a hotel as any. It's a Sheraton and shares all the positives and negatives of that chain's properties. This hotel has modern style rooms with flat screen TV's, multiple phones and a small bath/toilet room with an excellent water saving shower head. They provide all the usual bathroom 'soaps' although they do not provide bathrobes.Public areas are attractive.Parking at $44 per night seems a bit steep. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was properly cleaned.Since San Francisco is such a popular tourist/convention destination we did not find the hotel particularly expensive. Cheaper hotels exist in the area and city and those more concerned with their budgets would be wise to look elsewhere for equal quality at a lower price.

<Content>Great Location for Exploring San Francisco Just completed a 2 night stay at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf and we found it to be a great base for sightseeing. The hotel is in walking distance of the Wharf, cable cars, and Ghirardeli square. The street car stops right in front of the hotel for China Town and Union Square. The hotel has been recently updated and is decorated in a modern nautical motif. The bedding was comfy, the towels were fluffy and there was a large flat screen tv.There is a Trader Joe's two blocks away if you want to pick up a snack, picnic or bottle of wine.Parking was a bit stiff at $43, but that is to be expected in a major metro area.We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Would not stay again I had requested 2 rooms, 4 people, one room with a king bed, the other with 2 beds and was refused 2 beds as I had booked through Hotwire. This didn't make sense to me but was told that as I had gotten a deal I couldn't have 2 beds in the one room. This made sleeping for my daughter and I very uncomfortable as we are unsued to sharing a bed, both being restless sleepers. Also they were trying to charge us with parking 2 vehicles when we only had one. Their parking prices $100.00, for the one vehiicle, were horrendous.

<Content>Great stay at the Sheraton My husband and I were in town for a wedding for one night and booked the room through hotwire for $127. What a fabulous deal. Check in was easy and we were able to check in at noon instead of the normal 3pm. Our room was nicely decorated and the beds had lots of fluffy pillows. We also enjoyed the flat screen t.v. and the bathroom ammenities were wonderful. The location was great too. We could walk to the pier and restaurants from the hotel. Also there is a bus stop in front of the hotel and we used this to take the street car to union square for $1.50. I would have given a full 5 stars but the concierge tried to push a timeshare presentation on us which I thought was tacky.

<Content>Not happy be aware It seemed like a good fit, within blocks of the cruise line we were traveling on. Requested a lower room due to disability and was placed in the building next to the main office that was being renovated. It required steps to the room and also had roped off areas that we needed to get around the workers that were doing the renovation.  We requested late check-out as a Starwood perfered customer and they refused. I showed them were the book in the room for guest stated a late check-out for Starwood guest. They said the book was out dated and we had to check out at noon and could not stay until 1 at which time we could check in to the cruise ship. I asked for the manager and he said the same. Needless to say my shadow will never cross their door step again.

<Content>OK but extras cost a lot I stayed there for a conference. The staff was very friendly and attentive but overall the hotel nickel and dimes you for everything. $20 for a continental breakfast, $5 for an orange juice, $15 internet access, etc. For the conference, the hotel charged $100+ as a set-up fee in the conference room for internet access then an additional charge per day. We live in an age where it really doesn't cost much for a company to offer internet access and certainly not $100 set-up fee for 30 seconds of work.Fortunately, our room was on the Radisson side so for personal internet access I was able to connect to their wifi. Kudos to the Radission for being in the 21st century. The Sheraton TV channel said that complimentary internet access was coming shortly to this particular Sheraton but shouldn't a Sheraton in the heart of 'technology central' be the first to offer complimentary internet access ? Overall, its a nice hotel but for $200+ a night, I would expect less nickel and dime-ing. Consider the Radisson . . . I think it even less expensive.

<Content>Nice Stay! I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and had an enjoyable stay. We checked in on a Friday morning around 11am. Check in was fast and the agent was friendly. My friend and I each had a room and the rooms were, as requested, next to each other and we were on the fourth floor which is the top level. On entering my room I discovered it had not been cleaned. I went back downstairs, the agent appoligized, offered to move my room or put a housekeeping rush on it. I choose to keep the same room. Later that evening the agent sent up a bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese basket. Nice touch! The room was decent size. It has a bed, a couch, a chair, desk and flat screen TV. The bathroom area is on the small side, but with just one person in the room I didn't have any problems. Nice beds as always found in the Starwood family of hotels. Windows open for a fresh breeze of ocean air. Since I really don't spend much time it was perfect. There is a pool but it was much too cold out to even think about.We did not dine at the breakfast buffet or the coffee/wine bar in the lobby. We asked the concierge on several different occasions to suggest resteraunts in different areas. On Friday night, the first lady we dealt with was somewhat unhelpful. She was using Open Table and seemed not to know much about the city at all. She suggested to just go over to that area as there are many resteraunts in that area and that was it. Not much help. The next day we asked again for a good Italian resteraunt. The response was I know this one and let me call. Oh I have to leave a message and they will call you back. No call, the concierge didn't do any follow up. The next night I asked about a steakhouse and the gentleman suggusted House of Prime, a prime rib place not a steakhouse, and that was it. When I asked for anything else, he wasn't too helpful. I asked about another resteraunt and he said I think it burned down. I did not as we ate thare that night. I suggust the phone book -- it's more help! I do not know if these are employees of the hotel or an outside service the hotel uses. But good luck.The first night to venture out we asked for a cab. They offered a sedan for $30 to go across town. Not bad. But beware, these prices change daily. The next day to go to the same place was now $45 -- cab cost $18. The doormen really want to put you a sedan. But have them call a taxi -- they are always around and you do not have to wait long.I inquired with the bell desk, since I had lost all faith in the conceirge, to ask about transportation back to the airport. We took Super Shuttle from the airport and that took almost 2 hours and was horrible. So I asked taxi rates, and of course, they tried to sell me a shuttle that would get me back to the airport 4 hours before my flight. Then the bell desk offered a sedan for $45 which we took. No problems there.We tried to use the free internet check in in business center. We were flying Virgin America and they were not offered. I then paid the $5.00 to use the internet for 10 minutes to find out you couldn't print from the computer. I spoke with the front desk who told me to go the concierge and there we go again. The concierge this time was too busy selling packages and kept saying just wait, a few minutes more, and wait a minute -- so finally I gave up. I was tired of being shuffled to the back of the line while the agent made her comissions.Overall I enjoyed my stay, would advise anyone to stay here but to not use the concierge service.A few good places to eat while in SFO -- Orginall Joe's Steakhouse. Decently prices, historic, great food -- but make a reservation!! Absenth -- French Bistro in the Theatre District -- great for Sunday brunch! Close to the hotel is the Fisherman's Wharf Cafe -- good for a cheap breakfast and fast. Great service.Also nice about this hotel is there is a Walgreens and Safeway across the street. Great to pick up a few things.

<Content>I would stay again We were visiting Carmel and decided to go stay in San Fransisco for a few nights while we were there. We chose the Sherton because it was a beautiful hotel. We had to get 2 rooms since there were several of us. They were able to put us in rooms right next to each other. The views from the rooms were gorgeous. We walked where ever we went, so it was at a good location. We bought a LOT and the people at the front actually had someone help us load the cars so that we could get out of there soon (we were about to be late for our flight). I want to return there in the future and I'd stay with these folks again.

<Content>Awesome location! We stayed here in between 5 days in Napa and our flight home. We got in early because we had to return our rental car and they had our room ready (11 a.m.)! The lobby was nice and the bellman got our luggage right up to the room. It was large and clean and bright. Everything we needed was right there. The concierge was helpful when we needed advice. Pier 39 was only a block away, which was terrific. And Pier 33, where the Alcatraz tour leaves from, was a very easy walk. We took the cable car to the financial district for dinner and drinks. It couldn't have been more convenient. We would definitely stay here the next time we're in the area.

<Content>Very nice hotel ! Stayed in Sheraton FW 4 nights in beginning of April. The overall impression is very good. Pluses:+ location ! - this is probably the main about the place. It is really located very convenient to all the attractions + rooms are big enough and clean (the bathroom is rather small though)+ very nice food stall which become a bar in the afternoon/evening - it is very handy for breakfast (we used it always instead of going the restaurant)+ the outdoor sitting area with open fire is very nice in the eveningMinuses:- small bathrooms- the color concept and lighting of the rooms make them a bit hospital looking - white and blue with bright white light.- the AC is rather noisy - the walls are really thin and you can hear all what is going on in the neighboring roomsOverall: great place to be when in SFO. Can recommend to a friend !

<Content>Nicely renovated but watch your wallet This is a hotel I have stayed in numerous times over the years. This was the first one with family (children aged 10 and 6). I know that $33m has been poured into the renovation, and the rooms and lobby space are certainly nicer. But overall I cannot recommend. Pluses include the upgrade to the room and lobby; free access to fitness club across the street; friendly staff. The main minus is that the hotel seems to have license to nickel and dime at every last opportunity. Parking is $50 a day (!!), Internet access $15 (the Radisson across the street has free WiFi), a mediocre-looking buffet breakfast is $19.95 (I looked but did not indulge), and the food prices in the lobby cafe are high. Water pressure in the shower is awful. There are also some annoyances from a family perspective - they do not have cots (even for extra $$), there are no fridges in the rooms, and the layout of room is such that there is no way to have only a bathroom light on behind a closed door. There is also not any space in the hotel where it is comfortable to sit. The lobby has tables and chairs and is constantly freezing due to poor design. It's probably better than a lot of the other second-rate hotels in the area. I like Fisherman's wharf because of easy access to GG bridge, the Embarcadero, and great running in the morning. But be warned there is not a decent meal to be found in the area.

<Content>Nice rennovation Stayed here during our engagement trip. While we heard a lot of bad things about this hotel on this site, we had a good rate and stuck with it. Turns out our stay was great. The room was brand new and very nice. No loud construction noises. Only noise encountered were the Telegraph Hill parrots in the tree outside our room - this was a pretty cool sight and not a drawback!! Guest service were friendly and helpful and location great. No issues here!

<Content>Location is the only reason to stay here The location of this hotel is the best reason to stay here, but if you can find a similar location for the same price, I recommend you stay there instead. Though the hotel was clean and newly renovated, there was a charge to use the internet, the hotel dining was outrageously expensive ($3 for a cup of tea!), the tv channels were minimal, and the staff was chilly except for the concierge, who was helpful and patient. You are basically getting a room in a good location close to Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach. If you don't expect more than that, you should be fine.

<Content>Another great weekend in San Francisco! After staying at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf property 2 years ago, my husband and I knew first hand what a great location this is for staging your San Francisco/Napa/Sonoma vacation and chose to stay here again with friends who have never been. Our weekend was from Friday April 11th through Monday April 14th and we caught the rare 80 sunny weather for the entire weeked!They have rennovated the hotel, and truth be told, it is tacky and ugly. The decor two years ago was old and dated, but had the charm of the wharf in it's nautical atmosphere. They've tried to update it with an Ikea feel, but it looks as though it's a temporary shell rather than the hip ambience of the sleak W (the higher end cool Starwood property). I think they've missed the mark. If you're looking for a classy or hip hotel...this is not it.Now on to the positives....the staff! WOW! My husband and I are world travelers. We travel no less than 5 or 6 times a year for vacation and relaxation. We have freqented dive dumps to 5 star resorts, and the staff at this small, aged hotel were a force to be reckoned with!Upon our arrival, we were greeted at the front desk by 3 smiling faces. Darren took care of us personally, but each staff member at the front desk had smiles and hellos to go around. As we went through the check in process, Darren found out that we were celebrating my birthday, and immediately called the bell staff to have a bottle of complimentary champagne brought to the room! What a great personal touch!!! It was a wonderful way to begin our weekend. He also sent a hand written happy birthday note, and even remembered my first name in the card. In a day when customer service is hard to come by, Darren went above and beyond. And it didn't stop there!The housekeeper on the 4th floor was one of the most pleasant and efficient women I've ever encountered. She did her job with a smile, and greeted us in the hallway every morning with a hello and extra towels. I'm sorry I did not get her name so that I could add it to the letter of thanks that I sent to the staff of the hotel.The Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf is in a great location to launch your exploration of San Francisco and all it's wonders. You don't even need a car, as most places are accessable via public transportation, or on foot. However...there are a few downsides to this hotel. As mentioned above, the decor is tacky at best. The parking is OUTRAGEOUS! It cost us more to park for 3 nights, than it did to rent an SUV for 4 days. As a starwood preffered member I was VERY disappointed to know that they have done away with their club level. They used to upgrade members to their club floor, which had the perk of breakfast and a happy hour free for members. It was just one of those nice things that they've taken away. Now they put you on the executive floor which offers nothing in the way of perks. I think they should at least offer free parking!All in all, this hotel is in a great location, a good bang for the buck considering other hotel prices in the city, and the customer service was out of this world! I am confident that if you encountered a problem, the hotel staff would be quick to remedy any issues!Have a wonderful trip!

<Content>Think again We stayed here for 4 nights in March 2008. If I was returning to San francisco I would choose another hotel to stay at. We were given a twin room even though my husband  I requested a double room when booking, when I asked to be moved I was told they were booked out of double beds for the 1st night but they could move me the second night. The next day we pack our bags up in anticipation of moving only to be told at reception no we cannot move you. When I spoke to the front office manager he was rude and not helpful in offering any solutions and told us that they always over book on double/king rooms (which I find unsatisfactory as you should get the room you book). We also over heard the manager make snide comments about customers and us whilst we were still in hearing distance as we walked away. The hotel was also evacuated on the last night at 1.30 am as the fire alarms went off and it was a false alarm, we have been told since that this happens on a regular basis. I myself have worked in hospitalty for over 10 years and have travelled extensively and found this hotel very unprofessional for a Sheraton and for the amount you pay for a room - not worth it.

<Content>Excellent location We stayed at this Sheraton for 4 nights at the start of a 3 week stay in California and it appears to be the nicest hotel in the area. The hotel has efficient check in staff and the conceirge were very helpfull.We didn't eat at the hotel as there were many hotels to eat in the wharf area which were quite good.The rooms are a bit bright and not to everyones taste but thay are newly renovated and have comfortable beds which is the most important thing and they have starbucks coffee in everyroom which was a nice surprise. The hotel also has an outdoor heated pool which not that many have in San Francisco have.As it was our first time in San Francisco we took the city tour and trip to Alcatraz which were excellent.I thought San Francsco was a fantastic city and the Sheraton was in an excellent location on the wharf and for the tram and trolly stops.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We stayed for two nights in February and had an absolutely wonderful time. The pros: Lovely and bright room, hotel was just renovated so everything is brand new. Was upgraded due to points and had a club room. Big, beautiful bathroom and very comfortable bed and sofa. LOVED the outdoor fire pits - very cozy to have a glass of wine at and still be outside. Fantastic location - you are within a five or ten minute walk of everything at the wharf. Brand new flat screen TV's in the room.The cons: When we were there, still redoing the exercise room, but they gave us free passes to a nearby sports club that was VERY nice, the pool was outdoors and not very heated so we couldn't use that when we were there, not a great selection of food, but there are tons of restaurants once you set foot outdoorsWe stayed for free this time, but would come back and stay again on our own dollar

<Content>Great Hotel What a great hotel! 2 mins walk to the wharf. Its clean  tidy. The rooms are big and spacious with very comfy beds!! The only down side is the noise - but I do think that happens in every hotel in the wharf area - you just get used to it. The staff are helpful but the concierge is always busy so it maybe best to make your own trip arrangements - we did this and it worked out cheaper. I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>I recommend it Great position for tourists even though it's actually set back a few blocks from the wharf. I first stayed in a standard room and was a little underwhelmed despite a great bed. I then returned a few weeks later on a more generous client's budget and stayed in a suite which was fabulous, great furniture, fittings and facilities and an incredibly comfortable bed. The service was very good throughout the hotel, it is handy for strolling along the wharf, cable cars are nearby but you are surrounded by hundreds of far more interesting places to eat than the hotel has to offer. I would stay again.

<Content>Excellent Location We stayed for 5 nights and were very happy with it. Our room was on the ground floor, which is excellent for older people. The location suited us very well as it was near great seafood restaurants and public transport was plentiful. The buffet breakfast was great, plenty of fruit and a large selection of cooked dishes. The coffee machine in the bedroom was a godsend, as it was simple to use and produced good coffee.Altogether a good visit.

<Content>Perfect place to stay We just returned from a stay at the Sheraton from 2/26/08 - 2/29/08 and were very pleased. Our room was small but extremely comfortable. It had obviously been recently updated as the decor was quite modern -- very bright colors and eclectic. The bathroom was small as some reviewers have said, but it was fine for our needs. The room was very quiet. The view was awful (the rooftop below) but we didn't care since we were not in the room much during the day. There was a huge digital TV in the room too. The only noise we heard was footsteps overhead. One night at about 4 AM the fire alarm went off (false alarm) which rattled us a bit, but the hotel staff was very apologetic about the disturbance. The hotel was extremely conveniently located to Fisherman's Wharf and was within walking distance of many attractions (Pier 39, Alcatraz, Ghirardelli's Square, The Cannery, the cable car turn-around) and many restaurants. There is a Walgreens, an IHOP and a grocery store within a block. The hotel had a great seating area out front with gas fireplaces where we were able to relax and have a glass of wine after a long day of touring. I would definitely book at the Sheraton again. We got a great deal through Funjet and were thrilled with the trip. If you want a clean, comfortable, convenient, reasonably priced hotel, this one is it.

<Content>Fantastic I would like to say that this hotel knows how to provide outstanding and professional service to families. The hotel staff went above and beyond to meet all our child's needs. The management also brought a microwave to the room to assist with heating babies bottles.The room was modern, clean, spacious and comfortable. Staff were always polite, professional and willing to go the 'extra mile'. The concierge prints requests within minutes and is fluent in many languages.Overall the hotel is in a fabulous location at Fisherman's Wharf, close to all local tourist attractions. I would recommend a stay here to anyone.

<Content>Great location, average hotel We scheduled an eight day long trip up the California coastline to San Francisco. We stayed at the Sheraton at Fisherman's Wharf for 3 nights of our vacation.First off the hotel couldn't be in a much better location, we thought. It is only about a couple blocks walk to Pier 39 and all the great dining that it has to offer. Ghirardelli Square is within walking distance as well. The cable car stop can take you to Union Square for more great shopping with a fun ride.While we were there, the hotel was working on some pretty extensive renovations. These are pretty badly needed because the hotel was looking a little bit dated. The carpet in our room was very well worn, the wallpaper faded and peeling a bit, and everything was just a tad dark for my tastes.If they still offer it, get a club level room. We didn't know what it was and had to call and ask, but it was worth the extra few dollars per day. Essentially the club was a small area just outside the entry hallway to our wing of the hotel. They had a nice contiental breakfast with lots of fresh fruits, juices, cereals, coffees, etc. I know it sounds like standard continental breakfast fare, but the quality was good enough that I actually wanted to eat it. In the afternoon around happy hour time, they have cheese trays, fruit trays, and other tasty snacks. Both services are included in the Club Level Room price.Overall, we thought the place was a tad overpriced for the quality of the rooms, which hopefully has changed substantially due to the improvements they had in progress. They said we were the last people to stay in that room before they shut it down for renovations. The staff was pretty courteous but not outstanding. The concierge seemed kind of useless...at the stand they had a little sign stating that he was an employee of some travel information service and not the Sheraton. When we stopped to ask some questions, he helped us, but tried to sell us a bunch of trips and stuff that we weren't remotely interested in...in short, I want a concierge to be an information resource that can help us find interesting things to do, I don't want a sales pitch.We liked it, we'd probably stay there again if we wanted to stay down by the Wharf.

<Content>Don't judge a book by it's cover! Hotel is in Fisherman's Wharf, close to everything. Exterior of hotel is very old and dated...I was worried when we drove up to check in. But as soon as you entered you could see the renovations! VERY beautiful and stylish lobby. Rooms were great, as well. We had a king bed in our room and had plenty of space. Not much of a view as all the surrounding buildings are the same height. Great, clean rooms and bathrooms. I would definitely stay here again. PARKING: is $43 plus tax per day; watch out!!

<Content>Nice renovation We stayed at the hotel for 6 nights. The location is a bit touristy. The hotel is nicely renovated. Room is big and bright. But the bathroom is still tight. Only thing is the heater is a bit noisy. and they should place a minibar in the room. Hotel offers valet parking but it's very expensive. You can park your car in the garage accross from the hotel or search for a street parking maybe one or two blocks away from the hotel. I love the new Sheraton bed, they are really comfortable.

<Content>Loved this Hotel We stayed here as part of a celebration for our 20th Wedding Anniversary and we thought the hotel was great.We arrived in the city after staying for a few nights in Sausalito at 10am, thinking we would be able to leave our suitcases until we could check in. We were greeted by a lovely guy at the reception, who said our room was ready now and that we could check in straightaway. That was just fab, now we could relax for the day without having to check in later.Our room was gourgeous, large, had lovely furniture and was freshly decorated and not a mark on it. If you like minimalist decor, this is the hotel for you, very contemporary. If you don't, then find another. The room was cleaned everyday, with fresh linen daily too. Though the bathrooms are on the small side, they are beautifully tiled and very clean.All the public areas in the hotel are lovely especially the Firepits. It's great to sit out there at night having a drink and socialising.We had a wonderful night out at the Cityscape Restaurant (46th floor of the Hilton Hotel) as 'the' celebration of our anniversary. It was fabulous, you must book a table there the views are spectacular. But what made the night even more special, was our concierge arranged the hotel limousine to take us and pick us up. I felt like royalty. It only cost $30, which is about the same price as a return cab journey, which is how we thought we would have to travel. It is litle touches like this, that made the stay special.All the staff we met in the hotel were very friendly and efficient and always ackowledged you with a smile and a greeting.There is still a little renovation work going on, but this is done during the day, when most people are out sightseeing and everything is tidied away for the evening when you get back.The area is touristy, with many hotels, shops and restaurants and Pier 39 is just a 5 min walk. The Powell  Mason Cable Car Line is just a block away, so really great for exploring the rest of the city. Get a Muni Pass. Our 3 day one was $18 and you can use all the cable cars, trolley buses and normal buses as much as you want.We would stay here again and would recommend it to friends.

<Content>Looked Good, but Looks are Deceiving! We were very excited to stay at the Sheraton at Fisherman's Warf, especially since we had got such a great deal on Priceline.com, but we were not happy with this hotel at all! It does look very nice with the upgraded modern decor and the firepits outside are a nice touch, but looks are not everything when it comes to a hotel and that's all this place has! My first complaint is that the walls are paper thin! We heard everything! The people across the hall had music that was not even up high and we could hear it in our room. The security guard would walk down the hall and you could hear his radio going off so loud that it woke me up! Then at 6am the person next door took a shower and I could hear everthing that they were doing! The whole time they were in the shower all I could hear was a loud screeching sound, then I could hear their blow dryer and every other time they turned on a faucet! I laid awake the whole time they were getting ready for their day because it was so loud! Then after we left, we got charged a $250.00 fine for smoking in the room! And we don't smoke!! We complained to the security and the man who we spoke to told us to call back the next day and speak with a different manager, and when we called back no one had even heard of this person! I thought the Sheraton was supposed to a reliable, stand-up brand of hotels, but they are not! I would only reccomend staying here if you don't like to sleep or are a very deep sleeper, and you have $250.00 that you want to throw away!

<Content>standard, smelly hotel We stayed at this hotel on the first part of your US trip for our first year anniversary.The location is great with the piers, restaurants and main sites close by.The hotel itself was ok. staff were friendly but the rooms were sub-standard. They were big but very dated. The carpets and curtains had stains and everything in the room smelt funny including the bed sheets. I assume the smell is from the local piers as its so close. The hotel itself has a very fishy and stale smell.

<Content>Close to Fishermans wharf Room was cleaned daily, but carpet was disgustingly dirty. Curtains and bedskirts had numerous stains. Rooms closest to the streets could hear the street noise and people talking outside. The new part of the hotel was probably nicer and better, but when we arrived it was opening day and the rooms smelled like carpet or wallpaper glue. We couldnt stay in those new rooms so opted for the older ones, but if we'd known it was so drab and stained we would not have picked this hotel. The only plus was that is was walking distance to many buses and street cars, and of course fishermans wharff. and only 6 blocks or so to chinatown.

<Content>Not impressed We stayed here for three nights. We booked this hotel because of its location, which is great with walking distance to all the restaurants including Pier 39. I am a gold preferred guest at Starwood and by check-in we were told our room would be upgraded. However the room felt like a standard room besides a gold sign on the desk saying Preferred guest room. The upgrade was probably this golden sign! According to their website they just spent 33 million dollars on renovation. The hotel still feels old and run down. They have for example done nothing the bathrooms. They are by the way small and extremely cold. The TV was great but the system was quite often unavailable on the screen. There was no mini bar and the soda machine on the floor was out of order. The staff was very friendly. Extra plus for the bell man.

<Content>Great but hated the decor!!! Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel on a return visit to San Francisco. Valet parking on arrival (parking approx $40.00 per night only alternative was unsecure next door at $33.00). Staff very helpful and friendly. Room great, very clean and modern, huge flat screen TV, PS2, internet port etc. Bathroom quite small I thought considering size of room. We chose not to eat at the hotel so cannot report on food but lots of choice and very reasonable. Hotel is huge and the decor is ultra modern (horrible!) it's mainly white with turqouise and bright yellow accents (I felt like I had steppped into a beach hut!). Our room was white with yellow blinds with turqouise bedding, pink cushions and silver furniture. If you like modern and minimalism then you will like this, I hate it so it was a bit of a shock when I walked in. Overall though a very clean modern hotel with good facilities (has fire pits outside for you smokers). Location is fantastic only a block away (2 minutes walk) from Fishermans Wharf and the sightseeing tours (5 minutes from pier 39).10 out of 10 even if the decor was awful!!

The bed was so comfy, I didn't want to get out of it, the best bed I have slept in! The bar area is ok and the restaurant we didn't see. There is so mush to do in San Fran that we spent most of our time out of the room! But definitely a good place to pitch up for the night!

<Content>No soul but good sized room We stayed in the Sheraton for three nights before heading up to Lake Tahoe to ski. The staff were mixed in their helpfulness and attitude and it could be a little noisy at night. We found that the room we had was of a good size but that the bathroom was small. The bed was huge was I didn't like the fact that there was no cover on the duvet - just a top and bottom sheet. The location though was very central and we found some good places to eat. We also felt that the hotel had no character or soul although the refurb had made it look a little modern (with a distinct 70's feel).When you think of the Sheraton name you think of a top class hotel but this is not true of the one on Fisherman's Wharf. Should we visit San Francisco again, we shall stay somewhere else.

<Content>Great Hotel with Great Location We stayed at this hotel for three nights (Jan 1-3, 08). First of all, it is a very nice hotel, especially for such an amazing price we got from Hotwire (less than $30/nt). The location is also great, just a block from Fisherman's Wharf where most activities happen. Another good thing is there is a Dollar rental car in the hotel, so it's very convinient in case you will need a car.For budget travelers, all services like food, internet, movie, and music seem to be pricy. We got a queen-bed room with a widescreen LCD TV (not many free cable channels, though), two side-bed table, a love-seat, and a large bathroom. The room is not small, but not large neither. There is nothing special about it, but everything is clean and they changed sheets every day.Overall, it's great hotel and I would recommend it for fellow travellers.

There is refurbishing being done, but for a Sheraton(we stayed at Waikiki also) it was pretty ordinary.Definatly not up to the Sheraton calibre.Rooms were clean and tidy but very small, not much services, ie. no resteraunt, very flimsy Bar facilities, looks like they just set up shop here yesterday.

<Content>awesome motel I have read the reviews on this site and I am quite amazed how people could have a negative view about this motel?????Even now back in Australia my family still state that it was one of the best motels we stayed in on our 4 week travel around the USA and Canada.Great location has everything at your finger tips. Close to all the attractions that you want to visit. Staff are always friendly and helpful and no matter what time of day it is as soon as you are in the lobby they always yelled out a hello. Rooms were very spacious, we were only in a standard room and there were 4 of us it was large enough, but let's face it do you spend all day in your motel room??? no you are there only to sleep. Motel is very quite at all times of the day. If you are after a great meal go to IHOP across the road the food is always good and very low cost.Outside the Sheraton they have a great set up for you to sit out by the fire and have a drink or a smoke if you wish. If you are looking for a great motel in San Francisco take my advise DO NOT GO PAST THIS ONE.

A good rate, especially for New Years.The Sheraton claims to have just been redone, and the room appeared to be very fresh and nice, with large flat screen TV and nice linen. The lobby is also fresh with a good lounge and comfortable spaces.The location is excellent, far closer to the wharf then I had expected, an easy 3 minute walk from all the action but far enouugh off that the hotel is very quite. Also, it is mid way between the wharf and pier 39 which makes it very convienient. The rooms run somewhat on the small side. In fact, we requested a roll away bed in our room with 2 full size beds and were told that the hotel does not have roll away beds anymore. The room would have had (barely) enough room for one but apparently it would have been a fire hazzard. OK - so the teenagers had to share a bed.The bathrooms was decent, but with one MAJOR mistake... the sink in outside the door to the room with the toilet and shower. For some reason, there is only one light switch that turns on the lights both over the sink and in the bathroom - thus if you want to shower or... at night while others are sleeping, you do so in the dark or wake everyone up. Not well thought out. Also of note in the bathroom, the toilet is very small - if you are of generous perportion, you know how uncomfortable this can be. Beware.The 3rd and final negative of this hotel was that the air conditioner/heater had not been replaced. In this day to not have a proper thermostat is annoying. The unit on our room required constant adjustment and turning on and off to regulate the temp. Overall, I considered this hotel a bargin for the price I got, but I would not have paid more or booked directly. I really liked the location but would probably try the Raddison right accross the street in the hopes that the issues above would not be repeated.P.S. If you are at Fishermans Wharf, try the Crab House for dinner.... really a fabulous meal!

<Content>Very elegant Very nice hotel in Fisherman's Wharf. Elegant furnishings, beautiful linens, wide quiet hallways with lovely carpets and nice elevators. Beautiful pool area. Altogether very quiet and exactly what we expect from Sheraton. Extremely professional staff. We've stayed across the street at the Radisson which is junky in comparison. The Sheraton is very comfortable and a tad upscale of the wharf hotels. For hotels at Fisherman's Wharf, the Sheraton is my second choice after The Tuscan Inn.

<Content>New look, but still needs work I almost gave the title of this review something not-so-nice, but I decided to be as objective as I could so here it goes....The last time I stayed at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf was 6 months ago on the company dime. During that time the hotel was in the middle of a renovation. It had the old man and the sea nautical theme and was going to be transformed to something more modern they told me. Fast forward to Nov and another business trip. One of the first things you see before you enter are the fire pits...very nice, very modern touches. As soon as you walk through the automatic doors you're left wondering what motif they were going for. I've labeled it modern, beachy hip. There are splashes of turquoise, browns, and shades of green everywhere along with circle and stripe patterned carpets. The hotel is still undergoing the final phase of renovation, though it looks like most of the work is done so I can't imagine it looking any different. Although design may seem to be a bit over the top, it is still much better than the old man and the sea feel it had months before. Now to the rooms. The beachy theme is carried into the room. The carpet patterns in the room are much better looking than those lining the hallways. They're less busy and less likely to have you cross eyed while staring at it. Beds were a little bouncy, though the pillows were comfortable. I didn't have any problem falling asleep each night.There were a few things I had issues with in the room:1. The lighting in the bathroom is horrible. The mirror has florescent lights recessed into the each side of the mirror going from top to bottom. This wouldn't be such a bad thing except that the sink has you at a distance that causes the lights to blind you.2. There are no towel racks, though there are towel hooks you can put your towels on. Very inefficient if you plan on using the towels again or hoping to dry them.3. My room had that door that connects to the next room if I happened to know the people next door we could join the two rooms, but I didn't know them and the space under the door was 2 inches wide. If you got down to the floor and looked under the the door you could see into the other room.4. Widescreen LCD TV. nice idea, but no HD programming to take advantage of the widescreen LCD. Those with LCD TVs know that these sets shine with HDTV, but when used to watch regular TV the image is even worse than an old tube TV. Hopefully, HD programming will be in the works, but I'm not holding my breath.5. Heater/AC unit. This was the biggest problem I had with the room. This unit is so loud that you have to crank up the volume on the TV. I overheard other customers making the same remarks. If you're a light sleeper I'd suggest not running this thing.To be fair there are good things:1. Room service - Room service was excellent. I never waited more than 20 mins before the food was in the room. At one point food was delivered in 10 mins!!!2. Breakfast was good and tasty. I didn't have a chance to try lunch or dinner, but I can tell you that the Southwestern omlette and all American breakfast are well-portioned and yummy. Of course, it's a bit pricey but that's how room service goes.3. Hotel staff is very courteous and helpful. They're all aware that the hotel is in a state of transition and they do try their best to make sure that you're happy. I did speak with the hotel manager and explained my issues with the room. He provided adequate compensation for my time there and for my next stay.Luckily, my visits are company subsidized so I don't feel too bad about the negatives. I've got a high tolerance for things, but it doesn't mean that I don't notice the problems. I will be staying here again in a few months since my company doesn't give me any option to stay at the other hotel down the street that sounds like Wyatt. I can only hope that the suites that are being built are better than the standard rooms. If not, I'll be speaking with the manager again and I'll probably be talking with my company to change hotel preferences.So there it is. There are more minuses than pluses, but I hope that'll change. If you're actually paying for this with your own money I CANNOT recommend this place at the moment for the above mentioned reasons. There are a few other hotels in the area that are at the same level (or better) and from what I hear they lack the problems that this one currently has.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great location This hotel was very nice and a great location. Fisherman's Wharf is only a few blocks aways, as well as all the Alcatraz tours and the Trolleys. The rooms were large, and were always clean. The front desk staff were always happy to assist with recommendations for food and booze. It's a great place to stay on you next trip to SF.

<Content>overall good value, great service My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights October 16 to 20th. Our first impression upon seeing the exterior (it is an older building) was oh-oh. But further examination showed that everything was freshly painted, unlike some of this hotel's competitors in the area. Outside there is a smokers area with nice outdoor furniture and outdoor fireplaces. As non smokers we just grabbed a seat and enjoyed the fireplace. Once inside, the lobby makes a good impression--new and bright colours, sort of 1950's Lucy and Ricky Ricardo meets Miami Vice (my wife calls it mid-century modern). Just off the lobby is the restaurant/bar area, and the only beef here is that the lights can't be dimmed a bit at night. Hotel staff stated this was being worked on, and that the lights would be dimmed at night in the near future. The part of the hotel being rennovated is visible down the hallway, and if earlier reviewers stayed in this area (presumably with rooms to match) they were probably disappointed. The new rooms were bright and cheerful, with all new cabinetry/couches/lighting and all matching the lobby decor. The bathrooms were updated with stone counter tops and new sinks/cabinets, and the tub area was retiled in modern looking colours. The area around the tub/toilet was a bit small, but overall it was usable. The bed was very comfortable. On two occasions we could here people laughing and partying in the outdoor entrance/concourse area at around 11:00 pm, and a quick call got response from the staff. Overall, we found the staff helpful and friendly.There are numerous other hotels in this Fisherman's Wharf area, and all appeared to have been built in the same time period, I'm guessing the late 60's early 70's, and all were low-rise 3 or 4 story structures. Some have been updated, and some not from our observations and conversations with other travellers. With that in mind, this hotel would probably rate higher than mid-pack in interior finishing, and at least mid-pack or higher in value. The outdoor swimming pool was warm enough for a night swim, even though the weather was cool. The pool area was neat and clean. The gym area was average with a useable universal machine and about six pieces of cardio equipment.

<Content>Great Location  I stayed at and attended a conference at the Sheraton over Columbus Day weekend. I knew that there were some renovations being done prior to my arrival, but I was shocked to find out that the lobby and my room had already been renovated! If you like blindingly bright white light and minimalist 70's era decor, you will love this place. The location is GREAT and the staff was friendly  accomodating. The pillows were scrumptious. I had food there at 2 different luncheons and it was fine. There is not a bar per se and I thought that was a little odd for a Sheraton. A colleague at the conference was staying in the Presidential Suite. I got to see what an unrenovated room looked like...wow..this place was WAY overdue for some updating. I think the Sheraton should definitely fire their decorator. There is nothing upscale or classy about this place.

<Content>Just OK We booked the Sheraton at Fisherman's Wharf because of the location, as well as our Membership to their chain of hotels. The room we had was on the street level with a 'view of the pool.' The view was of the street  fence mostly, quite stifiling. There was a pool to the far right of our room beyond a fence, which surrounded our patio. Another fence was beyond our enclave to the street, which was just a few feet from our enclosed dirty, debris filled patio. Bird feathers and a huge rubber gutter cluttered up our cramped 3x4 fenced in patio, with the obscured view of the pool. Street noise was abundant with the huge tourist buses  their fumes which greeted us every morning. Hence, we could not leave the sliding glass door open for air. The room had limited storage, an armoire with hanging area and just 3 drawers. Rooms are adequate and clean. The location is convenient to The Wharf and ground transportation. We were warmly greeted upon entering and leaving.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Great Location - will stay again I was pleasantly surprised after reading the bad reviews. I just returned after staying there Sept 15-19. When you walk into the hotel - there is a concierge desk with people to greet you on your right - but the front desk is easily to see from the front door on your left. They have renovated their bar area and added a courtyard outside with large lounging chairs and firepits with a glass around the area to keep the wind out. The inside bar has nice tall bistro tables for evening cocktails. The new renovated rooms are very nice with a large plasma tv and very comfortable large king bed. The hotel is older but the renovations they have made are a plus+. The showers have good water pressure and the maid service was great. I believe a few who wrote bad reviews regarding maid service never read the cards that are left on in your room at check-in. They state to please leave this card on the bed each day if you want your linens changed on the bed. Also, if you throw your towels on the floor they will be replaced with fresh ones. If they are hanging on the wall or door - those towels will not be replaced. The hotel is in walking distance to many sites - pier 41/pier 39. Breakfast places within a block IHOP and Dennys. Lots of shopping for gifts and in walking distance to both cable cars Powell  Market and Hyde St  Powell. Bought the 3-day Muni pass which gave us unlimited rides for the cable cars, streetcars, bus system. Great restaurants and sightseeing such as Alcatraz. This is a must and you can walk to Pier 33 if you so desire. Graylines did a fantastic job on the Wine Country Tour. Book your Alcatraz tickets early if you actually want to go on the island and walk through the cells. There are many companies that will take you by - meaning they sail around it and do not stop. You really need to take the Alcatraz Cruises that take you by ferry over. It's about a 2-21/2 hour tour. Well worth it too. Back to the Sheraton - we had a room by the street. No problem with noise as mentioned. Air condition work great. I checked out the hotels in Union Square and the business district. I was not that impressed in their locations. I did not like the high rise, with lots of traffic and noise and the only shopping I saw was what I could go to any mall and pay less than the prices they had in their stores. So I feel I made a wise choice staying where I did and when I return I will stay with the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf.

<Content>if you love cockroaches - stay here Blech. We stayed here in August and on the last morning, I discovered a cockroach doing the backstroke in my wineglass which was on the bedside table from the night before.The manager seems apologetic and offered to comp our foodbill of $60, which was the only charge we incurred as I had booked with SPG points. However, I see on my AmEx bill that they only comped us $20, and charged us the remainder for some inexplicable reason.That issue, coupled with the apparent tap dancing family residing above us (I swear they were running around in their room from 7am to 1am every night we were there), made for a terrible experience. My usually unflappable 10 year old insisted that we never stay at a Sheraton property again. I would have to agree.

<Content>Afraid to Stay Here After Making Reservation on the Internet I have to write a review now prior to actually staying here because making a reservation at this hotel was such a bad experience and a possible hint of bad things to come. I made a reservation over the internet and was instructed called the hotel to confirm the two beds and non-smoking. The reservationist was about as rude as I've ever encourntered. She treated me like some sort of inferior species. The hotel accepted my reservation, so why treat me like pond scum? I wanted to confirm that our room was non-smoking since I have lung disease and my husband has asthma (he is also a long standing starwood resorts platinum member). Most hotels are entirely non-smoking these days like Marriott. She snapped at me that since I didn't book the room through her she would promise nothing. I assume she would have charged me more? So, while her competition (Hyatt which is also a Starwood resort member) is pleasant when I call them on this issue, this Sheraton thinks being rude is the road to greatness? So, she is willing to make us sick to be right? I also wanted to confirm two beds. Again, she snapped at me that I would not get that, since she did not book the room!!! Sorry!!! Maybe her home phone should be on their website? She wanted me to feel like some type of a criminal, yet they don't give good rates all the time to conventions? Also, how many people this summer expected a full service hotel and got a partial service hotel that did not have half of their advertised amenities available due to renovations?: Many reviews question their 4 star rating. I am also staying over a time that is a slow time for them, so they will have empty rooms. I dread checking in there, but I have no way to get my money back. Even though I am a sub species, they still like my money and don't want to part with it! This is not the way a Sheraton should treat a guest!

<Content>Good location, friendly staff but that is about it The hotel was clean but very tired looking. One can only hope the renovations will be a vast improvement. Location was good -- obviously very convenient to the wharf but also a pleasant walk to North Beach. unremarkable in all other respects. Certainly not on par with our other experiences with Sheratons in NYC and Philadelphia.

<Content>Not a bad hotel at all When I got this hotel on Priceline, I was worried based on some of the reviews. I was prepared to write a scathing review! Upon arrival, however, I was pleasantly supprised. The room was huge, spic  span, with little or no road noise, and the bed was comfy. It's true the tub and toilet are in a small separate room, and that the A/C was somewhat noisy, but not overly so. They are renovating the hotel right now, so none of the public areas are open. Since I am rarely in the room, it's OK with me! They had cookies and coffee for free in the afternoon, and everyone on staff was friendly. I agree that this is definately NOT a 4 star hotel. The worst thing I can say about it is that they charge $10 a day for WIFI!

<Content>Fantastic location We stayed at this hotel from 23rd June for 6 nights and myself and my husband were, overall, very happy with it. There were renovations ongoing which meant the usual bar was not open, however there was still a bar and restaurant service available. The staff at this hotel were great, we had a problem while we were there and the staff could not have been better in helping us (particularly a man on the fron desk whose name, I think, was David). The location is definitely the biggest plus for the hotel - you have Pier 39 practically on your doorstep, Little Italy only a few blocks away, The Cannery, the cable cars and Ghiradelli Square a short walk etc. overall, we had a postive experience at this hotel and would stay again.

<Content>The worst hotel ever This has to be the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. On entering the lifts to go to the third floor there was a horrible smell in them. On entering our room there was also a damp smell which you couldn't get rid of. The room was decorated in 1970's style and although clean was very dated and very smelly. The hotel is currently getting refurbished and therefore many of the facilites are unavailable, such as bar, restaurant and swimming pool. Whilst we were there you could use the swimming pool but there was debris floating in it which made it less than appealing. There is a small eating area set up but we didn't use it as there was a large screen TV playing and did not want this whilst eating a meal. The two ladies I encountered on reception were extremely unfriendly, verging on being rude. The was a very helpful gentleman on reception. Guests are charged $41 plus tax which totals $46 to park your car in the car park which I think is very expensive for hotel guests bearing in mind that the hotel is certainly not superior. The only positive thing about this hotel is its location as it's only 2 blocks away from Pier 39 but don't feel this makes up for this very tired, dated and overall unfriendly hotel.

<Content>Not the Nicest Sheraton My wife and I recently stayed at the Sheraton Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf for four nights. It was a last minute trip and so we did not do much shopping around for hotels. The rate that we received at [--] was good for San Francisco. However, the rate of $156 per night should have raised some red flags. The Sheraton Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf is a category 4 hotel and so I wrongly assumed that it was along the lines of similar category 4 hotels that I have stayed at in San Francisco, such as the Palace Hotel.The hotel quality did not live up to the Sheraton name. The service was good as one would expect from a Sheraton and the location was excellent. The hotel is only two blocks from Pier 39, five blocks from Columbus Avenue in North Beach, and within walking distance to the Embarcadero.If you need to rent a car in San Francisco, it would be my suggestion to rent the car from Dollar, which is located in the hotel, by the day. Parking at the hotel is extremely expensive. My wife and I rented a car twice from the location at about $35 per day and we did not have to pay the overnight parking fee at the hotel.The downside to the hotel is that it is in need of significant renovations. I am a Starwood Gold Member and so we stayed on the Club Level. Assuming that these are the nicest rooms, I can only imagine the work that needs to be done in the other rooms. The room was clean, but there was a mildew odor that could not be removed regardless how much spraying they did. The wallpaper was discolored and pealing in some areas. The closet and dresser were falling apart and the furniture was stained and dated. The blinds were stained a gold and brown color that comes with age and were also falling apart. It was obvious from the outside that our room was not the only room with this problem. The rate is what brought us to this hotel, but the rate probably will not bring us back to this hotel.

<Content>Good for Starwood Points people, otherwise... We stayed at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf for one night during the Memorial Day weekend. We booked it using points, so from our value perspective, this Sheraton was worth it. However, there are clear caveats that we would like to pass on to other travelers:1.) If you are a Starwood Points person and plan to either earn or use points at a hotel that is conveniently located to many of San Francisco's main tourist attractions (i.e., Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Square, Cable Cars, etc.), then you absolutely cannot go wrong with this hotel. Everything listed above is within easy walking distance. Even North Beach, Chinatown, and the crooked part of Lombard Street are walkable from the hotel (if you don't mind walking uphill a little). The hotel itself is older, but clean, and the room that that we stayed in was on par with other Sheratons that we have stayed at.2.) If you are NOT a Starwood Points person, then there are some key detractions that you will want to be aware of before booking:- As other reviewers have stated, this hotel is currently under renovation and the construction work is clearly visable. Several entrances/exits are closed off so you can only enter the hotel from a few directions. Some parts of the hotel look very new and nice while others still look very old and dated.- While the hotel is conveniently located near Fisherman's Wharf, etc., it doesn't have much of a view of anything. You pretty much see the buildings immediately next to you and they are not much to write home about.- Parking at this hotel is extremely expensive. While I cannot compare with parking rates at other hotels within SF, I have to say the daily parking rate of $41 definitely caught us offguard. The front desk explained that this was the best deal around because this price gave us full in and out privelages, while other cheaper parking lots would make us pay each time we drove out. In hindsight, we should have just parked at the bargain lot because we never drove our car anywhere until we checked out. Obviously, if you don't have a car, this is a non-issue.Some other random points:- The front desk staff were very friendly.- There is a small outdoor pool. Considering that SF has a reputation for being cold, even in the summertime, I'm not sure if/when the pool would ever be used. (It was in the 60s when we were there, but with the wind it felt colder.) Of course, when I made that comment to someone else at the hotel, 3 kids preceded to run out to the pool, jump in, and have a grand old time... so who am I to judge?

<Content>Avoid. Not a bad location, could have been better though, the hotel is two blocks from the front and has no view , because the building is on flat ground, and it's the same height as surrounding hotels. We were unfortunate enough to be put in a room facing toward the bay, and the local tram service which runs from the early hours, passed directly beneath our window.Cable car turntables are a short walk away.Very small Pool, and not indoor, either.For a four star hotel, the rooms were basic, but overall clean and tidy, telephone that didn't work properly, Air Con with broken controller dial, cable television, inernet through T.V., I've stayed in better four star hotels.Staff were friendly, concierge desk was extremely helpful.Not very good value for money,I will definately stay somewhere else next time.

<Content>Good Choice, Nice Place... We were on a family road trip in the SF area and had just left a terrible Motel 6 in Fairfield. We didn't pre-plan or reserve anything in SF so we were actually just looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable hotel with a good location and found the Sheraton.We were happy with the rate ($150 plus $40 parking) and the room was much nicer that what we had just stayed in so we were thrilled. The hotel itself was very nice and we had great service but I think its biggest asset is the location. Very close to the wharf and walking distance to the pier, restaurants, trolley, etc....Had a very nice stay and would recommend it.

<Content>Dated, Dirty and Terrible Service This hotel was very dated, they are under a renovation, but looks like they have sunk their whole budget into the lobby area. Upstairs club room floor is worse than a dormitory in college and the rooms were filthy and poorly lit. To make matters worse customer service is lacking and the only thing good about this hotel is checking out. Do not stay here. Stay in Union Square and take a cab to the Wharf, it will be well worth your $10 for a cab. If you are thinking of this as a Sheraton property, think again - it's independenlty owned

<Content>Good value but fairly basic for Sheraton Good value for area...room with two double beds for 104 +tax. Hotel well located in Fisherman's Wharf area. Close to Cablecar stop.Beware of parking, over forty dollars per night Valet at hotel with no in/out privileges. Parked across the street for 20$ per night in parkade.If one of the reasons to choose this hotel is the fitness area, skip it. It is comprised of a few machines in a dimly lit room for which you have to go outside of the hotel.

<Content>BEWARE of San Francisco and hotels like the Sheraton First let me start with my reservation or supposed reservation for a king room at the Sheraton, we booked our reservation a week before thru Hotels .com, printed out our confirmation and thought we were all set . We arrived on Monday evening after a long cramped flight on Continental Airlines to the Sheraton, we were told they only had a room with 2 double beds, not a King like we booked and they could not do anything about it, they told us we booked thru a third party ( Hotels.com) and even though we had confirmation , it didn't mean anything, but they would have a King available on Thursday though, yeah the day we were leaving alot of good that would do. After going to our room , I called Hotels.com, they said it was on their website that they dont guarantee the room that you request or pay for and the Sheraton could not guarantee a room either ( Both are Scammers) We were told parking was $39 a day, There was no complimentary coffee in the Lobby( another way to try and force you to buy in their own Bar  Grill, there is no complimentary anything at this hotel, I dont mind paying for what I get but I dont like to be nickeled and dimed to death either. Like other reviews stated the bathrooms are too small. I had stayed at this hotel several years ago and it was not like this, this tells me people and businesses change ( In this case not for the better but worse) In closing I would suggest all tourist to find another vacation spot until San Francisco gets their act together and reduces their prices along with removing some cost all together . Tourist Beware take the advice and vacation somewhere else, Don't get robbed in San Francisco

<Content>Enjoyed our stay This hotel is in a great location. Two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. We were able to walk everywhere from this location. The bathroom is like everybody says - you have the tub and toilet in a little room with the vanity outside - but we didn't care. The bed was great - slept pretty good. One problem we had is the people in the room next to us were smoking as we were in a non-smoking area. It was actually making me ill - we told the front desk and they sent up security. They must have taken care of it because I never smelled it again. We really enjoyed ourselves.

<Content>Great Location Stayed over New Year's Eve with other friends. VERY convenient location. Just blocks from the water. Would be a great spot for tourists to stay. Clean rooms, but a little on the small size. Bathrooms are bit small as well. It's one of those where the vanity is in the little closet sized space between the entry door and the shower/toilet bathroom. It's a little on the tight side. I would've expected a little more for a Sheraton - but they can be hit-or-miss sometimes.Lobby is nice. Staff is friendly. Convenient to not only all the SF tourist areas in the Wharf, but there is also a Safeway conveniently located across the street, which is always nice for extended stays.Not a big fan of Valet only parking, and the parking prices are pretty steep, even as a guest - but I guess it's like that everywhere in San Francsico anyway.

<Content>Pass on this place. You'll be glad you did. I鈥檝e never written a review before, but this hotel is bad enough that I鈥檒l take the time. $279/night for the room + $38/night for parking? I don't think so. Fortunately, we got it for MUCH cheaper off Hotwire, but even then it was almost on par with a Super8 I've stayed at. Problem #1. The Room. I am a non-smoker, but will take a smoking room if that's all that's available because I've NEVER had the smell in the curtains/carpet/furniture bother me in the slightest - this place was ridiculous. The hallway smelled like the morning after a frat-party; stale beer and cigarette smoke. The room itself wasn't quite as bad (no beer smell), but the cigarette smell was cloying. It even was enough that my ex-smoker boyfriend mentioned it a few times. This was the worst I'd ever smelled. I have to wonder if they've EVER opened a window. Also, the bathroom candid photos you see on THIS site are dead on. TINY, dark little closets of bathrooms. Problem #2: The Concierge. They tried to get us to go to a timeshare sales pitch!!! Unreal! I just told you I'm in town for only two days, and you want me to go spend my afternoon getting the hard sell for a time share? Also, the restaurant recommendations were totally sub par - don't take their word for anything. Problem #3. I asked the reservations desk if they knew what the parking restrictions were for the metered parking on the street (we read the meters and walked up and down both sides and didn't see a single sign that explained when it was enforced). He responded very clearly that it was monitored 7AM to 7PM Monday through Friday. Since it was already after midnight on Saturday, we left the car at the meter and went on our merry way. Sunday afternoon we came back to a $40 parking ticket. The sad part is that it ended up being cheaper to get the parking ticket than to pay what the Sheraton wanted to charge me. I will NEVER stay there again, you shouldn't either.

<Content>Too much money for too little Overated hotel and once again the web photos do not paint the real picture. We paid 拢100 ($200) per night for our 5 night stay for poor accomodation. Our room was on the 4th (top) floor and was cold and damp feeling when we arrived. The a/c was noisy and the velux type window opened out on the turn of a handle revealing the noise from bell ringing tram cars, oversized environmentally damaging polluting cars, and the loudest car radios on planet earth!The bathroom was very small and very cold, and remained so throughout our stay. The beds were however very comfortable and we had ample bedding for the cold nights in early February.The hotel staff were friendly enough and extremely helpful even to the point of offering a room change on account of noisy neighbours!Not much more to add except that Sheriton is normally much, much better than this!

<Content>Great location, good price I stayed for two nights as a weekend away with my daughter. Room rate was $189. Total price with taxes was $215. That didn't include another $16/day for wireless internet access. I wasn't thrilled about paying that much for something that could just as easily be included in the room rate I was already paying.The room was nice - very typical of a Sheraton. It is a low building (3 storeys max?), so you're always near the ground, but we were on the 2nd floor and I don't remember any street noise.The location is only a couple easy blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 - a couple more to the Alcatraz ferry. It is close enough to public transit to get just about anywhere. There is so much to do in SF, we could easily have been there a week.My only complaint was that the outdoor pool doesn't have a hot tub/whirlpool, which would have been nice in November. The staff were friendly and helpful (e.g., arranging airport transfer).I would stay there again, although I could be tempted by an equivalent property with a better pool set-up.

<Content>The Only Choice For Pier 39 Or Fisherman's Warf Second visit to Fisherman's Warf and this is now the ONLY hotel we will stay at. PROS: Easy access to spacious 3rd floor room. Situated CLOSE to EVERYTHING. Great value for price. VERY SECURE environment. Friendly and informed staff. DO NOT take a TAXI from or to SFO Airport. Instead book a Town Car  Driver for $50, save $10 after tip and ride in comfort. Available through Bellman. CONS:Restaurant like every other hotel eating establishment is WAY over priced. No need to eat in Hotel - we didn't -everything from the best seafood within a five minute walk to having an iHop across the street. There were NO OTHER cons.We have stayed at a lot of Hotels and this one is a safe bet.

<Content>Great Location but accomodation could be better We stayed here during the first week of January. This hotel is perfectly situated, right on Fishermans wharf beside lots of restuarants and bars, all of the ones we had experience of were great, also Harris Steak House in pacific Heights is fantastic!As for the actual accomodation at this hotel, it is getting very dated and shabby. The room was of ample size and was clean but does need updated. The hot water in our room was not working when we checked in and we reported this 3 times over the next 2 days and still had to ring again to have it repaired, so this to me was bad customer service and annoyed us. This hotel is about a 2 Star, although the Compass Grill and bar in the Hotel are great and we had a lovely meal and drinks there. Stay here if you want to be well located but do not be expecting a 3star as it is not. When you are in San francisco must do's are the Alcatraz trip and the open top bus tour of the city, and a meal in Harris steak house and a pair of gloves and scarf in the winter!

<Content>$39.00 plus tax for parking is outrageous The hotel staff was very helpful, the rooms, clean and the prices at the hotel restaurant were reasonable for a hotel restaurant. The price for parking, however, was outrageous. It cost us more to park ($39.00 plus tax) than we paid for our rental car. The cost for parking whether you used valet or parked the car yourself was the same. When we complained on the way out to a member of the staff, his response was that in New York City it is way more, but we were not in New York City.If you want to be near Fisherman's Wharf, the location was ideal.

<Content>Good Tourist Hotel - Not a Luxury Hotel I booked this hotel via Priceline for a four night stay in mid-December. After reading the reviews, I was a bit concerned, but in the end had no problems and enjoyed my stay. True, the hotel is not a luxury hotel (and not a four star, although it Priceline considers it as such), but I appreciated the amenities (the concierge is on-site from 7am to 10pm every day!) and the staff was very accommodating when I asked for a non-smoking room above the first floor. My room (a corner room on the third floor) was very clean and quiet (I live in a large city, so the street noise was comparatively low for me), the bed was quite comfortable, and I did not notice any off smells. Overall, I was pleased with the location of the hotel. There is a Trader Joes one block away and a supermarket across the street. I did not have a car, and was glad because the fee for on-site parking is outrageous. Instead, I purchased a three-day Muni pass for $18 and used the nearby Powell-Hyde cable car line and F line to get around town. I did not eat at the hotel restaurant, as there are several other options nearby, including Mama鈥檚, a great breakfast and lunch place on Washington Square (only a few blocks away, within walking distance).This also appears to be a hotel that attracts a lot of groups, but I was never bothered by noise or crowds above the lobby level.Originally, I hoped to secure a hotel in the Embarcadero area, but in the end was glad I ended up in Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf. Although the area is a bit touristier, there seem to be more services and more activity on the streets later at night there.

<Content>Mediocrity at its finest The location of this hotel is good, depending on your interests. It is close to the cheesiest tourist traps in San Francisco, but it is also walking distance to lovely places like the Marina and North Beach. The Market St street car winds down Embarcadero to Market St with easy access to Union Sq and Castro St. Don't miss the Farmer's Market in the Ferry Building at Embarcadero  Market.The hotel has an upscale lobby but the hallways are badly in need of refurbishing, with stained carpets and a smell of industrial-strength cleaners. The mixed reviews may reflect the variability in the rooms. If you get stuck in one of the many rooms that face the noisy street or air conditioners, it would not be a happy experience. We insisted on a 3rd floor room that had a decent street view. It had an air of thead worn, faded style. The furniture was worn and dirty in spots.We could hear the people above us as they walked across the creaky floor. The original construction was shoddy and now signs of wear are everywhere. The bed left me with a back ache. The linens were nice quality though the bed spreads showed stains that hadn't come out in the laundry.Except for a check-in clerk, the staff were lovely - friendly, kind and helpful.We were able to pick up a free wireless internet signal from an adjacent hotel - the signal quality was excellent' so if you have wi-fi, don't pay for the hotel internet. You can avoid the exorbitant local parking fees by renting a car in the lobby by the day. You can drop it off in their stalls in the hotel parking lot. Just do a new rental each day.All in all, this hotel is OK if you insist on a good but don't stay here if you expect luxury or local charm.

<Content>Not as bad as reviews suggest I have recently returned from a four night stay at this hotel and I was very nervous of what to expect after reading reviews on this site. I am pleased to say that my stay was most most enjoyable and the comments I read here unfounded.We had a room on the 4th floor which was comfortable and clean. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The decor was again clean without being flash and pretentious.I would agree that the bathrooms are pretty small, but who spends long on holiday in their bathroom !!.The location is good being right on Fishermans Wharf but not in middle enough to be noisy.Don't be put off by staying here by reviews you may read here, I think some people must have very high expectations!!!!!

<Content>Great start to our California trip My wife and I spent the first four nights of a three week trip round Central California at the Sheraton, partly to take advantage of a 4 nights for the price of 3 deal. We were delighted with our room, which was clean, well equipped and quiet, despite looking onto the air-conditioning. All staff were friendly and helpful.The Sheraton was well located, within a block or two of Fisherman's Wharf, and it's fabulous views, the cable car system and a tour company, whose services we used to tour SF and visit Muir Woods and Sausolito.It was also within easy walking distance of North Beach with it's fine restaurants and Rogue Brewery's excellent pub.

<Content>Bad Hotel The room smelled like mildew and smoke. The window in the room did not close all the way creating a draft. The bathroom was small and there were no washclothes provided in the shower.When I arrived, I was told the parking was $13 per night; when I got the bill, the price had changed to $39 a night WITH a $5.00 parking tax. I had to pay $44 for parking when the lot right across the street was charging $28 a day. This hotel and its staff are second rate. Do yourself a favor and book a room somewhere else. After this experience I think sleeping next to the homless guy in the cardboard box on Pier 39 would be better than the Sheraton in San Francisco at Fisherman's Wharf.

<Content>All-around OK We stayed in a Club level room with our months-old child. They put us at the end of a hallway, which was great, and the crib was fine. Beds are comfortable and the meeting areas are nice. Pillows aren't great- a bit firm and flat. We liked the continental breakfast included with Club rooms and the evening food at Club level was enough that we skipped dinner one night out of three. The fresh fruit and veggies were the best, and the meatballs were good too. As mentioned by others, the hotel is definitely in need of an update. Our room looked out to the bay bridge. The window shade was stained and the wallpaper looked bad. We even had a little black mold in one corner of the bathroom. The bathroom door can't be closed without stepping out of the way first, so it's a tight fit. The staff was helpful when we needed it. I thought the charge for wireless Internet was too much at $14.95/day when we were already paying nearly $200/night.We took the Super Shuttle from the airport to avoid renting a car and paying for parking and would do that again.

<Content>Not a great hotel but location was good This is probably the worst Sheraton that I have seen. The rooms were small - we had a room at street level - there were people walking by talking and laughing all hours of the night. We had previously stayed at a Sheraton in Union Square which we found to be excellent - newer and cleaner rooms.The room was average in cleanliness. The bathroom light in the shower area did not work so we showered in darkness.The hotel is old and in need of an update. The beds were of average comfort. The conceirge service was excellent!! We used them to book airport transfers and a wine country tour. Dollar rent-a-car is on property so you can rent a car all day (starting at $29) and return it each night instead of paying the $40 parking fee that the hotel charges. There is a drop box so you can return after hours. The location is great. We were a block from Fisherman's Wharf and about a 5 minute walk from North Beah.

Also very high parking charges of 45 dollars a night and city tours booked by hotel very poor value for money with local transport far better value.

<Content>Not worth the price. This hotel may have a great location but the rooms are extremely old and dirty. The staff is helpful, but this really didn't help the situation. The moment you walk into the room you feel and smell the dust and dirt. You will not feel secure on the first floor. Groups are constantly gathering directly outside of your window. If you must go to this hotel request a room on the second floor or higher. Our shower wasn't draining and maintenance was extremely quick in coming to fix the issue.I am assuming that amenities alone make this hotel a 3 1/2 star because if cleanliness was taken into account it would probably be around a 2 star.I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, comfortable room A nice find in the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area. The hotel was hosting conferences and was very busy during our October stay. The lobby was always busy with waiting lines for the front desk, concierge and bell man. Service was average for a large property like this. We arrived well before check-in time at 10:40 AM and without asking if we could check-in (we were just hoping to store bags) we were assigned a nice courtyard room. One of the few in the hotel with a small balcony. The room was a decent size, and the smaller bathroom as noted in other comments was clean and functional. The bedding was excellent and furnishings were in good condition. The internet was a challenge expiring at noon but that warning does appear before you commit to purchasing it. Simply purchase it after noon and you've got all day and night to use it. Sent clothes out for laundering and they were returned as promised the next day. Avoided the parking prices by not renting a car (Hertz is just a few blocks away) until departing. All hotels in the area appeared to be charging between $35-$40/ night. Went to the IHOP across the street for breakfast but the hotel buffet at $16.95 person is far superior. It costs a bit more but the selection was endless. Housekeeping was efficient and the daily cleaning made us feel we were checking in to our room for the first time each day we returned. All in all a great place to stay in an area close to many attractions, cable cars and ferries. We did by the three day MUNI pass for $15. You can ride cable cars, buses and street cars with the pass and it saved us a fortune in taxis. We overheard from staff working in the halls that they are preparing for a $20 million dollar renovation. I don't think it is needed but I would gladly return to this hotel provided they were not undergoig renovations.

<Content>A business hotel - not tourist friendly This was my first trip to San Francisco and whilst the city was amazing the best thing about this hotel was its location.The rooms were very basic not even a fridge available. Parking at the hotel was a crazy $39 per night. Staff were as unhelpful as they could be begrudging any assistance required. There were no laundry facilities so had to search San Francisco for a laundrette. The business centre was never open to get internet acess.This hotel seemed to be full of business travellers and was clearly set up for that market, so why do Virgin Holidays offer it to tourists within their packages?

<Content>Nasty !!!! On our reservations it clearly stated that we were honeymooners, but when we arrived we were given what must be their worst room - at the ground floor at the back with a view of the parking lot and very noisy due to cars passing by all the time. The room itself was claustrophobic and really ugly. The furniture, the bathroom and general outlook were just ugly. As we stayed in other Sheraton hotels before, we were really surprised to find this Sheraton so uneappealing.We then asked for another room, and they gave us a room on the 4th floor that was supposed to be better, but it looked exactly the same except that this was a smoking room where the corridor leading to it and the room itself stunk of cigarettes so much that we could not sleep there even with the window open and with the cooling system on. We could hear the guy next door coughing the smokers cough throughout the night. At least the outer noise level there was lower since it was higher up.They also tried to charge us for the parking 40.00 USD per night whilst we then just parked our car across the road in the parking area there for 12 USD per night!

<Content>ok!!!! stayed here for 5 days.the hotel itself was ok,nothing to special.the reason i chose to stay here was that i am a wheelchair user and it was the most accesable place to stay in the city as the bay area is flat .it has a lot of shops around the hotel and plenty of places to eat.it is also just 5 minutes from the tour boats destination that take you out to alcatraz and the other bay trips.the food in the hotel was great and all the staff in the resteraunt and bar were chatty and helpful.the rooms were ok but maybe a bit small.i also had a room above the main entrance which was a rather bad spot as from 4 in the morning onwards there was a steady flow of cars arriving and leaving,the windows are not very soundproof either so take earplugs if you want a goodnights sleep!!all in all not to bad but i dont think i would stay again.

<Content>Thrilled with this hotel I was thrilled with this hotel. When I arrived they told me I was getting a free upgrade to the club floor because I had the starwood preferred guest card... wow! That's great.. You can get yours too at AntonStarwood dot com. I loved the location. There is a Dollar Rentacar in the building... we rented the car there then took ourselves to the airport and dropped it off there so we didn't have to pay for transfers back to the airport. The room was large (corner room 4132), it overlooked a beautiful tree with orange flowers. Every morning we got free breakfast, and every evening free hors doeuvres from 5 to 8 pm because we were on the club floor. The place was spotless. No one was mean. The parking costs $38 per night so I recommend you avoid taking a car altogether. The people from TowerTours had great tours, and they picked us up free. Take the Muir Woods tour with Clay if you get a chance. McDonalds is a block away. The historic street car for the tourists (called the F line) is directly in front of the hotel. All the ferries are in front of the hotel 1 block out. I also recommend Mr. Toad's Tours (1 block from hotel, walking toward the water). We got a 3 day transportation pass, good on the cable cars, trams, trolleys, and busses. We had no problems here whatsoever, but I can understand anyone being mad about the parking price!!! If you get on the F Line street car and go down the street a little, there is cheaper parking ($6 per night). 7/11 is a few feet away from the hotel, but they close early. Grayline has a double decker city tour that's fun... they are 1 block from the hotel (at the water). I loved the hotel. Anton Anderssen.

What's that?The rooms are very small and institutional-like. The bathrooms reminded me of my high school gym showers. Some deep cleaning is needed.The whole place is tending to be on the shabby side, and we had a glorious view of the bus marshalling yard.There must be a better place for the money nearby!

<Content>Good 3-star tourist class hotel This is a fine, but not remarkable hotel. It is not a 4-star luxury hotel (which is why I think some people are disappointed) but a good 3-star tourist hotel.The location is great for exploring the city, close to the cable car lines, most of the tourist ferries and the street car lines and walking distance to North Beach, Telegraph Hill, Russian Hill, Fishermans' Wharf and Chinatown.The rooms are nice, but standard hotel-motel rooms (except for the very nice beds) and the facilities are clean and adequate. The hotel staff was nice and the concierge was excellent. When we were there (August) the hotel was quite full with Italians, Germans, Brits and the French--even a Dane or two.I would avoid the pricey restr. and bar. There are plenty of nice alternatives nearby.Parking is too expensive and the lobby is bustling. The pool is small but heated and well-stocked with towels (which you will need as SF is ALWAYS cold.

<Content>Awful, Avoid this hotel We stayed at this hotel for two nights on a vacation. It was awful. My own complaints are very similar to the other reviews. We booked on priceline. We also called to confirm a smoking king room (and also emailed). When we checked in we were told we could not have the room we had requested (and they confirmed). The hotel manager (sounds like the same one discussed in earlier reviews) told us thats what you get for booking on priceline and said that we should have booked through them instead. The front desk staff was extremely rude. This is no four star hotel. The rooms are dirty and dingy. Ours faced the driveway on the ground floor. All night there were cars driving in and out, idling their engines. Our window was blocked by a wooden beam and cement post. The washroom was tiny and the tiles were caved in around the faucet and appeared to be rotten underneath. The rooms are also extremely small. I do not know if this is all rooms, or just the second class rooms that they relegate people who do not book directly through their site to. We asked for guest robes and were told we would have to sign them out (again, duplicating the treatment of an earlier reviewer who felt like a criminal). The location is the only positive feature...but it is not worth it! There are so many nicer (and less expensive) hotels in the area with the same location.When we checked in (in the early afternoon) there were still dirty breakfast dishes (with dead flies floating in the orange juice) left outside our door in the hallway. It was dirty and dingy. We requested an in room fridge (none were available) and to get ice we had to walk to a different building, and then up an elevator and down a hall. I felt very poorly treated. For the amount of money that they charge, this hotel is not worth it. It is not the same class or standards that you might expect from other hotels in the Sheraton line. It was awful. Do not stay here.

<Content>Good location, average hotel. I stayed at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf for two nights. I was in San Francisco for business and went to the city a couple of days early to see the sights. Location: Excellent. The hotel is situated in the perfect spot if you are looking to check out the various tourist spots in the city. A short walk takes you to Pier 39, where the ferry to Alcatraz departs as well as other tour boats. Next to that is the Cannery, Ghirardeli Square, etc. All within walking distance, which was very convenient. Room: Average. Nothing special and somewhat outdated. It was clean and fully stocked. Beds were very comfortable. All hotels seem to be pricey in the area, so I wasn't surprised, but a bit dissapointed that you don't get more for the money you pay in this hotel. Parking: Ridiculously expensive, as others have posted. This seems to be the norm in the area for hotel parking unfortunately. If you can avoid renting a car and make use of public transit instead, go that route. Staff: Very helpful. I had a room that was facing the street when I first checked in. Around 11pm there was still a lot of activity on the street (shouting, car alarms, etc), which for a light sleeper like me would have meant a sleepless night. The front desk was very helpful and able to get me into a room that was in a much quieter location. Overall, the hotel is average but in a great location. Enjoy!

<Content>Awful In July this year 4 of us stayed in The Sheraton Hotel Fishermans Wharf San Francisco. Our 2 rooms were dark and dingy with a musty smell. When we complained we were told by a disinterested Manager that she could give us 2 other rooms but they would be no different. Our compensation was a free breakfast for 1 morning even though we were staying for 3 nights. As we left the desk the were tripping over themselves to help another customer who was obviously known to them and more important than ourselves. The next morning at breakfast the manager appeared and in front of the other guests told us that we were to order only from the buffet and not the a la carte menu. As everyone looked on we felt like criminals who were trying to steal from the hotel. As my wife and I had booked the Hotel we were embarrassed in front of our friends. My advice - stay away from this hotel, manager unfriendly and unhelpful.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at the Sheraton for five nights on our first stop traveling down the coast . Had a good time. We had a corner room; small, but quiet. Beds were comfortable. Everything was clean; would have preferred more drawer space for clothing, but towels were plentiful. Bathroom, itself, is very small. You actually had to move to the side to close the door; but once again, clean. The vanity area was outside the bathroom. We found this area to be comfortable. There were two surface areas to put your personals, including a large mirror above each area. It also included a coffeemaker and hair dryer. This hotel is in a great area, if you are planning to spend time at the Wharf. The Alcatraz shuttle is right down the street. We ate in the restaurant once; when we arrived; pricey. The food was good. There are MANY fine eateries in the area. The lobby area and surrounding hotel area is very nice; maintained. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Conceirage was very good. Our one MAJOR negative was the parking, $39.99/tax per day. This is a public lot. If you come in late, you are parked way in the back. Spaces are narrow. The valet service also uses this lot. The price is the same, but we were told it might take longer to get your car. If you don't need a car, use the public transportation. It is plentiful and run quite well. We used it once; no problems. A little crowded, though. Checkin/checkout was painless. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>great location but too large The hotel was perfectly situated for us, a family of four. It was well located for everything we had planned and close to evening activities with young children. We thought however that it was too big, long corridors, bland rooms with small bathrooms, coffeemaker but no fridge or safe and a poor view of air conditioning system. A bit of a let down as we were paying more than in previous hotels on this particular trip that had far better facilities and aspects.The pool was ok but could do with some foliage to improve the location and better conceal the road and pavement on the edge of the property.The staff were all very helpful and we had a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Won't stay there again! This was my 7th trip to San Francisco and I've stayed at 7 different hotels. This was not a good experience. I paid by Priceline (my first time on Priceline) and when I checked in after waiting a long time - they told me I had a smoking room. I said due to health problems I needed a non-smoking room. They said since I booked on Priceline, I don't have a choice. The manager said I should have booked through their site instead. Since I checked in early, they told me I'd have to come back in the afternoon for my key. I had to wait in the long line (for about 15 min) to get my key.My room's window faced the driveway and all night I could hear the bell captain using his whistle to get a taxi, and could hear the people on the floor above walking, and in the next room talking and watching tv. This was supposed to be a FOUR STAR HOTEL! The shower NEVER got hot! It was warm for both showers I took and after walking for many hours, I had been looking forward to a hot, relaxing shower. I'd also had the a/c on to filter the air, so the room was cold, so I really needed that hot shower!The maid began knocking on doors at 9 am so she could start cleaning, and check-out is noon! I couldn't believe they would be coming when people are showering, etc.And you could definitely smell when the smokers began in the morning - the air definitely had the smell of cigarettes.Aside from the check in staff, the rest of the staff was very attentive and helpful. But the room with the ugly view, noise and no hot water made for an unpleasant experience.There are so many great places to stay. I would definitely pay more attention to the reviews the next time.VirginiaIrvine, CA

<Content>Eh...Largely unimpressed With the kids visiting Grandma/Grandpa for a week, I decided to take my wife away for a 4 day weekend in SF. As all of the events we had planned were near Fisherman's Wharf, I decided to find a location there, to minimize travel.I checked into prices at various lodging in the area- most of what I found was about 250.00 and up a night. Took a chance on using Priceline, asked for a 4 star hotel at 150.00 near the Wharf, and got the Sheraton. Needless to say, this ain't no 4 star hotel.The room we got was ok... simply that. It was a bit like a very nice Holiday Inn or Best Western, but far below what I'd expect for a Sheraton of this location and 250.00 a night price range. I was surprised that there was no coffee maker available in the room, and no free coffee in the lobby. Additionally, the bathroom door knob was loose, and there were no pens/paper at the desk to write on. On top of that, even though the room is priced at 250.00 a night, wireless internet was another 13.00 a day, and parking is 39.00 a night!!! Yes, I know it's expensive to park in SF, but that's ridiculous... You can find a garage a bit down the street for 20.00 or less.Priceline automatically gave us a smoking room. When I found this out, I called and asked the front desk if we could be switched to a non-smoking when we arrived, as cigarette smoke gives my wife migraines- they told me they would accommodate us. Though they were pleasant enough, when we arrived they said they were booked so they couldn't give us a non-smoking room. Argh... A positive though, is that the room was cleaned well enough that it didn't smell like smoke too badly. Also, when my wife came down with a headache, the valet was kind enough to give me the last two of his Advil supply.We had a light room service breakfast, it was fine.Bottom line- if you are looking to be near the Wharf, and can get the room through Priceline at 150.00 or less a night (I think I could have got it for 125.00 if I had tried), then stay here. Otherwise, it IS NOT 4 star quality worth the price of 250.00 a night. If you have plans in the city that are away from the Wharf, find another place to stay, there are a ton of less expensive and higher quality options available.

<Content>Rat's Nest This place is terrible! But Priceline is at fault here. I put 4 star hotel in and this came up. Couldn't have even been half a star. I went for a few days around New Years. It was AWFUL. The person in the room above us moved bodies (or furniture) all day and night. We complained at least 5 times (about that issue alone) and nothing was done. There was construction going on so our patio was covered in tools. That was lovely to look at each morning. The staff is horrible, especially at the restaurant. Never ever ever stay here. Never use Priceline. Oh, and the location is awful. It's far away from anything unless you're into the Fisherman's Wharf. BE WARNED.

<Content>nice hotel My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton in Fisherman's Wharf for one night June 30th. It was a very nice hotel which was close enough to everything. The hotel itself was very clean and nice. The employees were very courteous and helpful. We loved the fact that we could walk all over San Francisco and had no problem getting back to the hotel. We had something to eat late in the bar area and the food was very good. I know that people in other reviews said they didn't care for this hotel, but I was very satisfied with it and felt for the money it was very nice. We even got the romance package which included a wine  cheese platter and also a late checkout and it wasn't even that much more. I would definitely stay thereagain!

<Content>I liked it! My bf and I stayed here March 8th-11th and enjoyed it. I loved the location, so close to Fishermans Wharf, Pier 51 and you could see Alcatraz and the Golden Gate from just 2 blocks up. We did have to be moved from our first floor room to one on the 4th way in the back because of noise, but it was done quickly. LOVED the beds. We didnt rent a car til our last day there so we didnt have to deal with the expensive parking and even though the pool was being renovated, it was March so no need to use it. I would say the hallways were the bad thing about this hotel, but everything else seemed pretty nice especially for the location, comfy beds and the good price we got.

<Content>Disappointed We are a family of 5. We were recommended this hotel by our travel agent and being a Sheraton I thought it would be great. We stayed 3 nights and had adjoining rooms. We were disappointed because the rooms were very ordinary, our rooms in particular were a long, long way from the elevator, the pool was being renovated (although we could cross the road and go to another hotel to use their pool!), there was no fridge in the room. The main downside of the hotel was the price of parking which was $36.99 per night plus tax which threw out our budget a bit. Coming from Australia I wasn't aware of the cost of parking. The staff were also not too friendly. I think I would look elsewhere next time.

<Content>Fabulous Location, Good Service, Clean Rooms The Sheraton at Fisherman's Wharf in San Franciso offered very good service, the rooms were very clean, the restaurant was nice, but the parking was incredibly expensive! Most of Fisherman's Wharf Parking is expensive but the Sheratons was more! Next time we travel to San Fran we will not be taking the car! Also after 11pm the streets are a little dodgy! We didn't feel too safe, there are alot of scam artists trying to take your money. Beware of the photo shops, the camera shop I walked into asked what type of camera I had, then proceded to take photos with my lens, then his, not realising I saw him put my zoom to maximum to take the photo. The offer went from $300 for a lens to $100 for the lens plus a 100GB memory card, so I stayed clear of those shops for the rest of the stay.If you are planning on doing Alcatraz, I would suggest the evening tour as it would be much less crowded. One last thing, we rented bikes and rode to the Golden Gate Bridge, it was excellent!

<Content>Easter in San Francisco We had a very nice clean room with plenty of towels for our family of four. We did not use the restaurant, but found many places within walking distance for all meals. The wharf area has plenty of eateries and things to see. This Sheraton is not a resort - so we didn't expect to dine, swim, or exercise while visiting. This is a clean safe place to stay while visiting a major US city.

<Content>update on my last review re: Club Level Room This is an update on my review from last week - I heard from the manager of the hotel who was very nice and explained to me that out of the hundreds of rooms there, there are actually only about 30 Club Level Rooms in the entire hotel, and most of the rooms on the 4th floor are standard rooms. We were told by the front desk the whole 4th floor was Club Level, and that was incorrect. We were given the wrong type of room twice, they were oversold on Club Level and did not disclose that to me when we checked in. So we were given a standard room (not in great shape) and charged the Club Level rate which is about $50 higher per night! She apologized sincerely and refunded the night's stay (actually we were only there 8 hours total), and said the issue was being addressed with the front desk and reservations departments so that they would be aware of the problem. So just be forewarned, if you have a confirmed reservation for Club Level you may not get it but you might be charged for it anyway if you don't realize it ........ I am grateful that management did the proper thing in the end, although at the time it happened it was frustrating, aggravating and inconvenient.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Great City Previous reviews have said it all, the Sheraton can't be beat for location. Take the negative reviews with a large pinch of salt we loved it here. We had 2 rooms on the 3rd floor both nice  clean and well fitted out, no view but hey! you are in a city expect 'views' of other hotels, car parks and bus stations. I would not agree with previous reviews that say this place needs remodelling as it is an above average city hotel. We were too busy to eat at the hotel but what we saw was nice. Only negative is the parking charges $40+. We saved paying this by taking the airport limo with Virgin Holidays (brilliant) and picking up our rental car 4 days later from Dollar's O'Farrel St location (easy). Bottled water in the room is expensive at $4.75 you can get the same over the road at Safeway for 75 cents. Yes, San Francisco along with many other big cities has a homeless people problem we saw some of this around Union Square but it did not affect our trip at all. We went on to visit Vegas and LA but San Francisco was definately the highlight of our holiday.

Room was average, and I was disappointed that the pool was closed for remodeling.The gym is really only a room with three treadmills and some other equipment.Fisherman's Wharf is touristy, but I do recommend visiting once in your life.There is also a major homeless problem here, and some are scary!

<Content>Good Stay Stayed 3 nights and was very pleased with the hotel and the location. As others have said the parking was exspensive but had taken that into account when we booked. By using priceline and only bidding up to the amount we were prepared to pay because of the parking charges we paid no more than staying at a motor inn with free parking. If we had to pay rack rate we would not stay there. The rooms were ready for decorating but the beds were really comfy and the bathroom was fine, with hairdryer and coffee maker ( with starbucks coffee). Our room had a patio which over looked the pool which was nice but the patio needed weeding as it was a mess. The pool was nearly ready when we were there but as others have said you had to go to the Raddison to swim, but we were far to busy sightseeing to want to swim, plus the weather was not warm enough for us! I think if you get this hotel for the right price you can't beat the location as it's only a short walk to a lot of attractions or transport to many others.

<Content>Great location Just arrived home from 3 nights at this hotel. I agree with others, the location can't be beat. You can park your car and enjoy some great entertainment within walking distance. However, the rooms are dated and the hotel needs to invest money on a huge remodel. The pool was closed for repairs so they arranged to use the Radisson pool across the street. Our son was disappointed. The parking is $36/day plus tax. The valet actually suggested trying other parking if you wanted cheaper, but you could only go in/out once a day. If you park at the hotel, you have unlimited in/out priveledges each day. I got this reservation on Priceline for $84/day, which for the location, was a great price. If you can get the deal on Priceline, I would recommend it.

<Content>Better than we expected After reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor we wondered whether we'd made a wise choice in booking the Sheraton at Fisherman's Wharf, but enjoyed our stay there.On arrival we were warmly greeted by receptionist Jimmy, who, after we requested quiet rooms, upgraded us to Club class. The rooms were fairly spacious, very clean, and well equipped.We enjoyed the complementary breakfast, which was more than adequate for our needs, offering a good selection of fruit, cereals, pastries, and two hot dishes each day.We found the staff to be generally friendly, and helpful, particularly Jimmy, the concierges, and bellboys.We didn't eat in the restaurant, but had a light lunch in the bar, and although the waitress was rather slow, the barman quickly spotted the problem and stepped in to supervise our order. The food was fine and reasonable value for money.The hotel is very well situated for access to the piers and the trolley buses and we found cab fares (albeit shared between four people) were quite reasonable.

<Content>Its all about the great location. I stayed at this hotel with my husband  2 kids ages 3  6. I chose this hotel because of the proximity to the piers  numerous tours/attractions, and it didn't dissappoint, with many interesting sights within walking distance. The parking fee was astronomical ($40 for self OR valet), but it was worth it because we valet parked our car when we arrived and didn't move it for the 2 days we were there. They also allowed us to keep our car in their lot until 5 P.M. the day we checked out, which was nice. So, the bottom line is...I have no complaints, other than the room was on the small side, especially with two small children. The hotel staff was pleasant. I thought the beds were comfortable, although my husband found them too soft. I'm not sure I agree with the 4 star rating. It seemed more like a very nice 3 star.

<Content>Could've been better Overall it was a decent experience. We booked 2 connecting rooms with a shared inner door, smoking with king beds with a AAA discount. When checking in it was an hour before posted check in time so we did expect the possibility of a delay. We did not expect the level of disorganization we encountered. She argued with us about our rate saying that it was a convention rate and we were not with the convention and should not have the lower rate. We reserved the room through their own reservation line. It took nearly 20 minutes of searching before she evn found us 2 connected rooms. they were not the king smoking rooms I had reserved. The rooms were not ready so were forced to sit with our luggage cart in the lobby, 4 adults and a 16 month old who needed changing, something to eat and was tired after a 4 hour drive. At 3:15 we were able to enter one room only as the other was not clean, check in is at 3. The room was very small and not connected as she saidit was. We went back down to the lobby and requsted another set of rooms as this would not work, because of the baby we needed easy access, and this was not what hse had told us we were getting. We were helped by a wonderful man named Jim. In less than 5 minutes he was able to get us 2 smoking rooms that were connected, with balconies so we could smoke outside as we do not smoke near children. He also waived our $41 parking fee, sent a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates to each room. But they were still not the king rooms we reserved. The pool was closed for construction. No big deal for us as it wasn't part of our plan, but it may be bothersome to someone else. Guests do have use of the hotel pool across the street. but who wants to be cold and wet walking around outside. we did not try the restaurants, but the menu options looked great. We used the valet parking as opposed to self parking so we wouldn't have to navigate through the garage. The rooms were somehwat outdated, but very clean and well stocked. Although in the smoking rooms it did look a bit older and everything had a yellow nicotine film on it.We had free water bottles in our room and starbucks coffee for the in room maker. although the creamers given required refrigeration and were spoiled. On to the beds. Part of the reason we chose this hotel was from all of the hype surrounding the new beds. My husband and brother in law loved the beds, said they were the best ever. Us girls however were not as excited. We found the beds and pillows to be entirely too firm with an oddly mushy pillowtop. The hotel is in great proximity to the Wharf and all the wonders it beholds, only 2 blocks. We did call down for directions to the zoo and were given directions that took us 5 miles in the other diection and ended inside the presidio, not the zoo. In all it seemed like a decent hotel, if a bit disorganized.

<Content>Another 4 star with no perks.... My wife and I just stayed there for a week and while the hotel may have been a 4-star rating, the amenities have been surpassed by many 3 or less star places that we have been. The high-speed internet was extra ($10/day), if you wanted to park there it would have been almost $40/day. No breakfast - no frills. The bed was above average but the room was about normal - not one I would consider in the 4 star range though. Oh and if you need to catch a ride to the airport, I would suggest you book it yourself. The hotel uses Supershuttle which they have troubles getting ahold of at times and who also never showed up for our early-morning departure.

The front desk staff were incredibly friendly, efficient and helpful and did their best to answer any questions we had. They even allowed us to check in at 10:30 in the morning when we got off our cruiseship. The concierge was great - booked us a great restaurant on Pier 39 for dinner, as well as a limo to take us to the airport on our last day. He was a wealth of information and always had a smile for you when you came in. The hotel is perfectly situated on Fisherman's Wharf, and the whole area is safe to walk at any time. We would stay there again in an instant !!

<Content>great location...definitely not 4 stars! We stayed here March 10/11. Note, parking costs are out of this world - over $40 per night. There is no overnight discount then they TAX you to park ($36.00 parking $5 for TAX). The property is laid out strange - and the parking lot is confusing. If you check in after 11:00pm, you have to either drop your bags off at the front door, then drive around the block to get back into the parking lot - or wander around the parking garage looking for the way out then hike up some stairs with all of your luggage. Maybe option 1 is best!We had a club level room - which had a nice partial view of the Golden Gate Bridge. The bed was incredible! We also had the breakfast on club level both mornings - pretty good, but what a zoo! They need a better layout and more seating. The location was ideal! Close to everything. This is an ideal place if you want to experience the tourist part of SF. Do not expect anything on the fancy side - just enjoy the basic room, expensive parking, and excellent location.

<Content>NOT 4 Star Quality I booked thru Priceline, so the price wasn't bad ($100ish). But let me tell you. This is not what you picture when you hear 4 star. First let me tell you about the good things. CLOSE to the warf, walking distance to many good/fun things to do. The beds are great! Very cozy and comfy! Now for the not so good. If you want parking, it's close to $40. This is RIDICULOUS when you are GUEST in my opionion. We luckily found street parking, look for it and be willing to move your car when needed, but for us it worked out perfectly. The rooms were small and very outdated for a 4 star. Seriously the bed was the only good part of the room. There was a coffee pot, which we were glad about. But there were also bottles of water (not any fancy brands) which you could buy for $4.50! Yeah, $4.50! If I am a GUEST at a 4 star hotel, do you really need to REEM me on a bottle of water? Over all this was a disappointing stay...not even a full pad of paper and pen in the room! The pad of paper had like 2 sheets on it! Our room was non-smoking, yet the hall kinda smelled like a casino and the carpet in the hallway looked 20 years old. Ok enough of that! Let me tell you where to stay. The Argonaut. Right down the warf towards Ghiridelli. Total 4 star. Beautiful hotel, more expensive of course but well worth it. Lovely service, great beds, great decor and VALET parking for MUCH less than the Sheraton's garage! So to sum up my review...if I had paid $55 for this hotel stay, I'd be happy. But paying $100 for it didn't make me happy at all. Argonaut....all the way.

<Content>Location - location - location A block from Fisherman's wharf - and half a mile to Little Italy, Lombard St, Russian Hill and the Embarcadero. A mile or two to most other parts of downtown. Easy access to public transportation for farther away points like the Mission (Little Mexico), the Castro and Haight-Ashbury.Clean, standard, minimal frills, hotel room. Very comfortable beds (Sheraton's specialty)A 3-star hotel - but above average due to the location.Not worth full price for most - but a good deal off of Priceline (usually $100/night)

<Content>Great location Stay here for 4 nts from Feb 26-Mar 1. The location for this hotel is excellent. It's close to every tourist location. The room is average. I would definitely agree with people about this hotel not being a 4 stars hotel. I would stay at the Holiday Inn or The Mariott, since they look newer than the Sheraton.

<Content>Better than I expected. I also was nervous about staying at the Sheraton after seeing reviews on this site. I pricelined it for about $100 and got a nice non-smoking room with two double beds--perfectly adequate as we were definitely NOT looking for romantic. The rooms and bathrooms were a little small but more than met our needs. The beds were quite comfortable. We avoided the concierge, choosing to make our dining choices from a Zagat guide instead. The Wharf is full of tourist cheese but it felt fairly safe, well-lit and easy to navigate.

<Content>Perfect Location My husband and I stayed here over the long weekend. Here are a few highlights we observed:*Perfect location: We walked to all the nearby sites (Fisherman's Wharf, China Town, Union Square, Lombard Street, and Ghiradelli Square) My husband is not in shape at all, but he had no problem.*We did not hear the construction noise (10:00 am to 4:00 p.m.)*The decor is outdated *The beds were VERY comfortable*The pool was closed due to construction, but we were not planning to use it anyway. (If you wanted to swim, you could go across the street to the Radisson and use their facilities)

<Content>Nice place to stay for first trip to San Fransisco We honeymooned here on 21 August 2005 for 5 nights (before going to Oahu Hawaii). The hotel is in a good location - close walk to the Wharf area where all the shops and restaurants are - very handy for night time. The check-in was fast. All staff were friendly - we told them on arrival we were honeymooning and were given a room upgrade - bigger room  bed. (Sheraton do have a right to boast about those beds! They are so lovely and comfortable!) Because of the hotels' location being more or less in a built up area, I dont think there would be much of a view from any room so don't expect much in that way.Noise-wise we had no problems at all. We did get the impression that the hotel is more business-person orientated. But we couldn't fault it for our needs really, we were there to explore anyway so didn't spend much time hanging around the hotel apart from sleeping. You couldn't beat its location really.We never used the pool (it looked very small) the weather was too cold - thought it would have been warm over there in August and that did disappoint us, we had to buy more warm clothes!We ate breakfast there one morning, that was okay but not worth the money, theres loads more places nearby.We did a sight seeing trip on a double decker bus which was handy to get our bearings, an evening Hornblower dinner cruise which was fantastic. Also my new husband twisted my arm and we hired a tandom bike and rode to the Golden Gate bridge that was a great experience we shall always treasure. We booked Alcatraz over internet prior to going as it was right what we had heard - no chance turning up on the day and getting a ticket - being our honeymoon we didn't want to risk it.

<Content>would not recomend This place made our stay in San Francisco not a pleasant one.1.Front desk:not efficient took us more than 45 min. to check-in.2.concierge:bad recommendations to restaurants, it seems as though they get commission from the places they send you. We wanted a guided tour and we got a car with driver not a guide!3.Rooms:don't have any view, all facing innr court yard or noisy street.4.Parking:The hotel garage charges 40$ per day for your car and this for hotel guests.5.Food:Breakfast is avrege, dinner nothing special.Even if you have Starwood Gold Card you get no benefit!

<Content>Not So Great Granted, we Hotwired this place for a long weekend and got the room for about $100 a night. And I'll grant that it's very close to a Safeway, drugstore and Trader Joe's, as well as walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf, Ghiradelli Square, and the cable car station -- not bad for $100. Having said that, though, this place just was *not* that great -- it's one of those 'blow the wad on the lobby and give the guests sub-par, noisy rooms' kind of places -- and the interior halls (as well as our room) just looked tired and run down. I was annoyed that the king bed we were supposed to have (romantic weekend, right?) was changed without notice to two doubles because they were out. Right. For us and the other Hotwire people we heard complaining about the same thing. But since it was originally made through Hotwire, I figured I couldn't complain about the miniscule beds. (I mean, really -- who still has doubles?!) Our room was facing the bus depot -- and it *was* loud, even with the fan on. The people walking around upstairs were loud as well, though hall noise seemed minimal.I mentioned it was a 'fancy lobby/crummy room' kind of place, right? That also extends to the services: smallest tv channel selection I've ever seen; $10 a day internet that took my sysadmin hubby 15 minutes on the phone with their tech support people (and a dip into his own hardware supplies) to debug enough to use; prominently displayed $5 bottles of beverage taking up counter and dresser space throughout the room; small, poorly lit bathroom with tacky plastic mini-bath insert; $40 a day parking (after you pay the special 'so you're staying in the hotel' tax: the list goes on. I just hope they billed it right; between the 'on screen checkout' that didn't work and the 20 minute wait to checkout in the lobby, we just used the keydrop and hoped for the best. If the location is important and you can get a super-fabulous price, then you can probably live with it. If you actually expect a *nice* room, look somewhere else.

<Content>San Fran is fab Wow - this is one of the best places I have been for all sorts of reason (apart from the rain- but even that did not put me off). The Sheraton is an adequate hotel in a good location, I found the staff to be ok but had little dealings with them, the rooms were ok as well.Fishermans Wharf itself is fantastic, lots of seafood restaurants and lots of late night bars (10.30 was not a time I remember going home at - more likely 1am). If you like good food, lots of tourist attractions and fantastic bars head for San Francisco - you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Loved the comfy beds! We really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton. The beds were divine and the housekeeping was impeccable. I was a bit apprehensive about the Sheraton after reading some negative reviews here but was pleasantly surprised. Paying a little extra for the Club Room was a real boon especially for hungry teenage children as breakfast and hors d'oerves in the evening were included in the room price.I noted that a reviewer mentioned that the valet parking was a nightmare - we found it to be an excellent service. The only negative was that the front desk staff were a bit remote and frosty but all the other staff were friendly and helpful.This hotel is situated in an excellent area as it is close to trams and cable cars - a good tip is to buy a Muni Pass - we bought a 7 day one and got excellent use out of it. Fisherman's Wharf is just a block away and also there is a Safeway supermarket over the road, a Barnes and Noble on the next block. Really convenient. It is just a 5-10 minute stroll to Pier 39 to see the Sea Lions - we did that a few times both day and night.On the whole, the Sheraton @ Fisherman's Wharf was above average - reasonably priced and a good place to stay - I'd go back :-)

<Content>Loved San Francisco San Francisco is fabulous. This hotel is excellently placed for Fishermans Wharf,Pier 39 etc. If you're looking for night life this is not for you as everything closes down at about 10.30. As a point for Brits who are used to being served from the age of 18 do take out photo ID as although the legal age limit for drinking alcohol or just soft drinks in bars is 21 I'm 30 and got asked for ID several times. Although flattering it's a bit annoying if you don't have any on you!!I was quite concerned having reviewed these pages before we went. I do agree that it isn't 4* but we had 2 queensize beds, good size bathroom and the rooms are far larger than those I'm used to in the UK. I specifically asked for a room away from the bus station but the room looked onto a wall. The reception and concierge service were good and we only had one unfortunate experience with a member of staff who was less than helpful. The need for tipping is exhausting. Coming from the UK we are most definitely not used to the hand out technique from all service providers!!Must do's:- cycle from Fishermans Wharf over the Golden Gate Bridge, the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square and riding the cable cars. We booked alcatraz over the net at home through blue and gold ferries and picked up the tickets an hour before we were to sail, which was great.

<Content>Gremlins at the Sheraton Wharf Have just spent 2 nights at the Sheraton Fishermans Wharf - after spending 6 nights at the Hilton SF Union Square prior to that.I pricelined our accommodation for our entire 3 wk US trip and have to say, that it was this hotel that made it abundantly clear that priceline meant less service in their eyes.Accommodation was a ground level ageing room - (no fridge - but that is the Aussie in me!!) but clean and reasonably spacious.Didnt help that Sheraton were installing new computer systems over that same period. We had 2 knocks on our door one night - around 8pm the first time, from Housekeeping, asking if everything was ok, followed by a second call around 9.30pm, by someone asking our name.. I was concerned as I had had no explaination as to what was the problem - so rang the desk.Turns out, system had gone down and they had to confirm who was in what room and to prevent them reletting our room... now if only they had said that at the time of the knock on the door - much more understandable than me thinking that we may be subjected to some sort of room invasion.Alas, that wasnt the only glitch. We were waiting on a call from family that night - and didnt get it. Turns out, family HAD rung, and was told that we had checked out... so we had family wondering what the hell was going on - unbeknownst to us, until I rang them the following morning. One would think the Hotel Front Desk would have at least tried our room, or acknowledged the computer probs to our family who spent 12 anxious hours wondering where we were on the other side of the country...On checkout, we asked that our bags be stowed for 5 hours until our shuttle picked us up - no probs intially, but then it became our problem when they had no room (this was after saying that they could do it an hour earlier). I told them of this, and reluctantly, room was found.That night, while waiting for the Shuttle, I was watching 20 people trying to check in - and the line wasnt moving.Yup - computer probs again - and they could not allocate rooms or keys to their customers. I was waiting an hour and watched more people arrive and wondered what the Sheraton promise would mean to them...I can appreciate from the Staff perspective how difficult it was for them to deal with the computer probs - however - I feel that the customer (or was that the priceline customer...) was the one in the way..Great location for those who want access to the Wharf..Don't think I would stay there again myself.

<Content>Average hotel at premium price Stayed three nights Oct. 17-19. The first room they gave was overlooking a busy , noisy thoroughfare. Immediately requested another room in the interior portion of the hotel.The staff was accommodating. The room was clean and quite average and did not include a mini-fridge, which I would expect in a room of this rate. The shower head was not funtioning , but when alerted of this, the staff had it repaired by the afternoon and we where offered a complimentary bottle of wine or movie for the inconvenience...a good PR policy. The on site parking fee is ridiculous.

<Content>Enjoyed this hotel very much We stayed at this location for two nights from Oct 28-30 and really enjoyed our visit! The staff was nice, friendly and efficient. We stayed on the club level floor and had a great rate with a good breakfast. There are many things that are within walking distance since its so close to the Wharf, but you do need a car to get around and really see the sights. San Fran is a nice city with lots of fun and entertaining things to do. This hotel was very close to everything we wanted and we would stay there again.

<Content>Average Hotel. Below Average Sheraton Stayed here for a business trip. Hotel was touted as 4* on the site I reserved through. This is absolutely not a 4* hotel. It is an average 3* hotel. The housekeeping was the worst I've experienced at any level. Empty room service plates were left in the hall for over a day. Glasses in the room were not replaced twice. Trash not emptied. Tub filled with soapy water when I returned. Staff was pretty inattentive. Concierge had wrong info two different times. I expect more out of Sheraton hotels, I was disappointed in their service.Hotel is undergoing renovations right now too, but I was not affected by it, even though they were working right outside of my room. Just note, the pool will be closed 'til late Feb 2006.

<Content>An average 3* hotel in a big city. The room was bordering on the small size, but was very clean. The bathroom was small and did not have an exhaust fan. Our room window overlooked a scaffold due to the major construction on the outside of the hotel, and the noise level from traffic could be heard during the night.  Fisherman's Wharf is a great tourist spot and we will return, but will try another hotel.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay - no problem with building works We stayed at the Sheraton Fishermans Wharf for 3 nights at the end of a 3 week holiday starting in Vegas.Although we had not been prewarned of the building works, and we checked in at 2.30 to a room with workmen outside the windows, on scafolding, and making a lot of noise, that was the last we saw or heard of the builders for our entire stay.They did not start until after 10am and were always gone whenever we returned to our room in the late afternoon.The room was clean, dustfree and comfortable, if a little small, especially when compared to the other Sheraton we stayed in during our trip (Sheraton Anaheim)Our only complaint was that the internet in the room did not allow us to access my emails, but when I rang down  complained the $10 charge was removed from my account without question.All the staff we had any dealings with were friendly  helpful, especially the man in the business centre who was almost as excited as me when I was finally able to access my emails  see the photos of my newborn grandson!He refused to charge me for using the computer  even printed some pictures of the baby for me to keep with me! Thats what I call Customer Service!The location was excellent, close to all the attractions  we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.Good things to do whilst in San Francisco - Alcatraz of course, but the real highlight for us was the trip on the Big Red Fire Engine across the Golden Gate bridge! An experience not to be missed! (Departs from the Cannery on Fishermans Wharf, but make sure you book it in advance)

<Content>Great Getaway Weekend Spot Our room was very clean with updated furniture, curtains, wallpaper, a desk, and two double beds (incredibly comfortable). It was on the second floor overlooking the outdoor swimming pool area. The room had a large armoire/tv stand with two closets and a chest of drawers. The bathroom was small, but our shower worked well and there was a roomy vanity area, mirrored on both sides, so it never felt crowded. All the staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful. A few of the guests were a bit rowdy - we were awakened at 3:00am one night. But that can happen at any large hotel.The location was perfect for us. We liked being so close to Coit Tower, Washington Square Park, China Town, and the fantastic Italian restaurants of the North Beach area.Our experience was great. Overall a terrific stay.

The rooms here were ok comfortable enough but nothing special! the bathroom was small and needed a revamp, but the worst thing was that our room was on the ground floor and over looked the bus station the noise was awful!! ask for a quiet room on a high floor. We would rather have stayed up towards Union square as we felt the wharf area was a bit tacky.the city is fantastic and we will return but would not stay at the sheraton.

<Content>ideal location for tourists Have to say that this hotel was not up to the standards of other Sheratons in which I have stayed previously. OK, so they were working on the exterior of the hotel, which meant I couldn't see out the window nor open it, but the problem in my opinion was greater than that. It just came across as a bit dated and more comparable with what I would expect of a Holiday Inn. The room was reasonably clean, although not spotless. Very comfy bed - no complaints there. Shower was extremely poor - hardly any power - more a trickle; whether that was a water-saving feature or a fault I am not sure. Suffered quite a lot of noise from the room next door - through connecting door. Guess that's not entirely the hotel's fault - more the antisocial guests - but I had asked for a quiet room so to be given one next door to a noisy family was a bit of a disappointment. There's a small outdoor pool (heated) which is OK for a quick dip.The location is good - near to the tourist tack of the pier(s) - but also good for trams and bikehire down on the pier if you want to explore more of what the city has to offer. My last stay in SF I was in a hotel on Geary near Union Square, and I have to say I preferred being down at Fisherman's Wharf if not specifically in this hotel.

<Content>Shabby is definitely the word Checked into the Sheraton and asked specifically for a room NOT overlooking the construction. Got a room overlooking just that. Ripped curtains, dirty carpet (from construction dust). This property is not run by Sheraton, just under their umbrella. For the price charged, I would NOT recommend staying there. Perhaps Sheraton should review some of the hotels they license to outside owners.

<Content>the best bed I ever slept on!!! The Sheraton staff was informative and helpful, but not warm and friendly. The outside of the building was being worked on and covered with a black material. However, I never heard a sound from the work being done. The bathroom could be updated a bit, everything was immaculate in the room. Hairdryer and iron in room as well. The Sheraton has a sleep slogan regarding their beds and it's true!!! The hotel is also conveniently located 2 short blocks from the middle of Fisherman's Wharf, right on the F line streetcar line and 2 blocks from the Mason Powell Cable car line. There is a Walgreens and Safeway supermarket behind the hotel as well. Hope this helps .

<Content>Shabby - Not Chic The best thing about this hotel is its location ... on block from the warf. It has a nice looking lobby, though the chairs in the lobby had seen better days. The rooms were shabby, shabby, shabby! No pillow top mattresses, old worn furnature, mildewed bathrooms, dirty curtains, stained floor, etc. The staff is nice, but the management is suppose to follow up on complaints and does not!The Concierges peddle a vacation club (like a timeshare thing), which they say is not a hard sell. We sat through an hour (one on one) with the pitch man, 3 price schemes with the closer, and 2 price schemes with a follow-up guy just to get a free lunch and 2 passes for a winery tour (value of $130) ... not worth it. Don't stay here if you are looking for 4 star accomodations. Don't pay any more than you would for an old Holiday Inn.

<Content>Excellent stay at the Sheraton, Fisherman's Wharf. We spent 4 days at this hotel over Labor day weekend when it was very busy. Having read the reviews here I was quite apprehensive but I am happy to say that my fears were unfounded. Although exterior renovations are still ongoing they had no impact on my stay. The check in procedure was friendly and efficient. Room was recently redecorated, beds extremely comfortable and bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries, if a little on the small side. No outside noise bothered us.The room maid assigned to our area did an excellent job and the room was cleaned by 10:00 every day. We sent out laundry on the Sunday morning and it was returned by 7:30 that evening as promised. Front desk staff, bellmen and concierge were invariably cheerful and helpful. Did not use the restaurant but bar was fine for a drink before bed.Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay at Fisherman's Wharf - it's close to everything and the streets are safe at night.This is a solid 4-Star if not quite luxury hotel.

<Content>Clean and comfortable I was horrified when I read some of the reviews, but having booked the room on Hotwire, I wasn't able to get a refund. But when we arrived at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised. Every staff member spoke English clearly and was pleasant and helpful. The rooms were scrupulously clean (and I am extremely picky) and the beds were very comfortable. I asked for a room away from the construction and received a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the bus barn area. We were not awakened by any bus noise whatsoever. While the bathroom was a little dated (harvest-gold tile and older fixtures), the shower curtain and towels were new, plus the bathroom as a whole was extremely clean. We have stayed in two other hotels on the Wharf (Radisson and BW Tuscan Inn) and our experience was very similar to the Sheraton (room size, comfort, cleanliness and service). If you are looking for a relaxing quiet luxury stay in SF, the Wharf is not the place to go. If you need a clean and comfortable place to stay while you spend the day exploring SF, the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf would be a good choice.

<Content>Not quite as good as it should have been generally a bit dissappointed with the hotel, although we did get an early check after arriving overnight from Hawaii. The breakfast was generally very poor indeed and none spoke good english. Bell boys were good and arrange transport quickly and efficiently. Bar a little small. Generally just an ok hotel, no more.

<Content>Not a 4* hotel We stayed at Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf from 22/7/05 to 28/7/05, booked through United Vacations. At the time of booking I was informed of renovations at the hotel but I was assured/guaranteed by United Vacations that we would not be located anywhere near renovation work which is ongoing at the Hotel. I was actually told that United Vacations guests would be located in a different area of the hotel to any renovation work. I had also contacted the hotel ahead of our stay to request a non-smoking room (as United Vacations could only request this but not guarantee) away from traffic fumes as my son suffers from asthma and an Executive Assistant from the hotel e-mailed to confirm that this would be fine and that she had arranged it for us. You can imagine our disbelief when we arrived and were allocated a room (non smoking) on the ground floor (1st floor but on ground level), facing the bus station, with netting/scaffolding outside and a tramp sitting out on the street in front of the netting practically under our window! There was a sign in the room to say that guests should not open the windows as the renovation work was causing a lot of dust. The curtains were thick with dust! Wasting no time we asked for a room change and were told that the hotel was busy and that the only other room available would not be ready for another hour or so. Despite having just flown in from the UK and being somewhat tired and jet lagged we waited in reception for the new room. When we finally got into the new room we found that we were on the 3rd floor but we were still directly across from the bus station with netting/scaffolding outside. The curtains were once again thick with dust, we were unable to open the windows and the air conditioning unit was located on the floor, under the window and right next to the bed! So not only could we not open the windows for fresh air as we had the fumes/noise from the large bus station and dust from the renovations but we could also not put on the airconditioning as the location of the unit meant that the cold air blew straight into the bed and made the occupants freezing! The busses rolled into the bus station until about 1am and started up again at about 4am with engines running causing disturbed sleep due to the vibration and noise. We tried to contact the helpline numbers given by United Vacations but they were constantly engaged, in the end we just gave up and stayed out of the room as much as possible. Our son became very wheezy towards the end of our stay.The hotel on first impressions appears nice, the public areas are clean and presented well but this changes once you get to the rooms which are dark and dismal and need of decoration and a good thorough clean (particularly the curtains and air conditioning unit vents). The bathrooms really are small and poorly lit and the rooms in general are quite depressing and very basic. The wallpaper is dull, drab and peeling from the walls in places.The Hotel staff are indifferent and don't go out of their way to help, general apathy really. The conceirge staff are rude, brash and again not particularly helpful but then a good number of the local people we encountered in the area employed in the service sectors also appeared to be so! We have stayed in hotels throughout the world (always 4 or 5 *) and can categorically state that this is not a 4* hotel as described. It is actually more like a 2* hotel and the description is very misleading. The Reception area may well be 4* but the rest is only 2*. The pool is small, cold and unwelcoming so don't let the fact that the hotel has a pool swing your decision to stay as it really isn't worth it. The location is good and we did not have any problems getting around on cable cars or public transport despite the fact that the Wharf was heaving with tourists at the time. Lots of nice restaurants around.If you are booked to stay at this hotel I would strongly suggest reconsidering as it is not value for money and you could, without doubt, find a better hotel. We certainly would not even consider this hotel again and we would also not book through United Vacations again.

<Content>Starwood hotel disappointment - poor front desk customer service Stayed at this hotel using Starwood points. 7/31-8/2/05. Booked in March knowing how busy SF is in the summer months. Did it matter? not a bit. More on this later. My family and I have travelled here and abroad many times using Starwood points; its benefits are outstanding in my opinion. This, however, took us by surprise, as it did not measure up to the level that we have been accustomed to with all the Starwood properties that we have stayed at. I could go on and on about this, but I will just point out the things that failed to meet my expectations: - front desk staff are not customer oriented. The two clerks that checked me in acted as if I owed them something, or that I was there begging for a room... Bad bad bad... - We checked in at 2;30pm so that I could get an upgrade as it is automatic upgrade (when it is available, true) - the idiotic clerk pondered a question at us stating if we knew that the SF marathon was that day? I told him that it was booked in March, and I could care less that the marathon was on that day..... then as if to justify why there are no 'better' rooms, he proceeded to tell me that they had to transfer overbooked guests to the Hyatt the night before. Wow... - This same clerk then tried to get some money from me and stated that he could give us an upgrade - for $35/night additional. I was pissed. I knew then that these people were operating on different terms... exhaustively told him that i was in no mood to argue and to give me a room EXCEPT the ones by the scaffolding or the bus depot area in the back. (thanks to tripadvisors tip!) ... he said this: oh you know about the bus area,too??? That pretty much did it for me. - he gave us a room across from the lobby, overlooking the entrance - room 2112 to be exact. dated carpet. no, not a sweet sleeper bed. lousy tv channels. - by our 2nd night, remote control ran out of battery. called front desk, repair guy came 10 min later. then 2hours later (almost midnite), front desk called and woke us up, apologizing for the dead remote (but never mind that she woke us up right?) - offerred a free movie or 500 starwood points - i chose the latter. - The only plus IMO: the location. Ihop to the north; safeway and trader joe's to the east; 2 blocks to cable car; 1 block to fisherman's wharf; there's also a subway sandwich shop and 7eleven a few steps down. This, was my 11year old daughter's choice. Now if it was for me- I would have chosen the Westin St Francis. There's also Radisson, Hyatt, holiday inn around this vicinity. That said, I won't be coming back to this Sheraton again... perhaps until they can truly abide by the Sheraton promise.

<Content>No great shakes but absolutely fine really Stayed here for 5 nights last month whilst on a business trip. Good location if you are a tourist, I had a room on the top floor, a bit musty, very warm but if you switch the aircon on for the afternoon it's ok for the evening. No view as it's a block back from the waterfront. No excessive noise. They charge for anything that isn't tied down though, the water in the room was $5 a bottle. Ooh no hang on the coffee was free and when I left a note out asking for extra I got it so can't really complain. Didn't try the restaurant, went in the bar once, it was ok, kind of omni-hotel-bar if you know what I mean. Very efficient concierge desk. Car hire place inside the hotel, who advised us very well and were convenient. Would I go back? Nah, I'd find somewhere smaller, but this place is fine if you don't mind chain hotels. Oh and the staff were all really friendly and nice. This was my first trip to the US though so maybe everyone is like that!

<Content>Comfortable Hotel Spent 3 nights in this hotel mid July and found it to be very comfortable. The room was bright, clean and nicely decorated with plenty of space. Bathroom was a bit small as mentioned in other review, but this was compensated by the fact that the wash basins are outside the bathroom. Could not be described as a room with a view but didnt spend much time in the room anyway.Location was good for the fishermans wharf area, with easy access to all other parts of town by trolley bus and tram. The city bus tour is well worth starting of with to get some orientation. Alcatraz is a must, but book ahead. If you are booking through the internet, make sure you go direct to the blue and gold fleet website, because some other agent sites charge almost double! A ferry out to Sausilito is also a great trip. China Town and Italian area have some good eating places.

<Content>Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf - Don't Stay Here! What a disappointment. First of all, the location. I won't ever stay at the Wharf again. Once you're down there, it is near impossible to get out without a car or by taxiing every time. There's too many tourists so cable cars and MUNI get full fast. The hotel itself - sub-par service, sub-par rooms. Tiny bathrooms. Awful views. Cold outdoor pool (which they claim is heated). I can't believe it's rated as a 4 star. That is a flat-out lie.

<Content>Good room, fantastic location This is our third year staying at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf during the month of July. We travel from out of state each year for a family reunion and we have found this hotel to be a good value in a very expensive neighborhood. That said, here are some pointers if you pick this hotel for your Fisherman's Wharf location. The parking is pricey, currently running at about $32.00 a day. There are cheaper public parking lots nearby so you will need to self park to save on parking. The hotel's restaurant is OK but there are so many very good restaurants in the area that we always eat elsewhere (even breakfast). Ask for a room that has been refurbished. Maybe all the rooms are done now but last year some of our relatives had old style rooms. Our room this year was fantastic and faced the pool. We loved it as the bed was very, very comfortable and the room was quiet and restful.

<Content>Priceline - Warning ! This is a good example of the problems that can arise when using an on-line service like Priceline for booking hotels.I was bidding for a 5* hotel in the Union Square or Fishermans Wharf area for our 3 day trip to SF.My bid was accepted for this hotel and after reading the reviews had some concerns.On booking in my fears were justified - we were allocated the rooms on the side next to the bus station. These rooms are very noisy - the low frequency noise and vibration is disturbing and it starts at about 4am.I suspect that any guest who had booked directly with the Sheraton would not get these rooms, in fact a staff member told me that these rooms are always allocated to Priceline customers.thats the problem with priceline - you are always going to get allocated the worst rooms in any hotel.Don't ever bid for 5* Fishermans Wharf because you'll most likely end up in these rooms !

<Content>Great Location, So-So Hotel The husband  I stayed there from Sat to Tue in early June.The location is great, walking distance to a lot of attractions, without all the noise  traffic. The hotel common areas could use a little freshening up; the couches  chairs in the lobby were starting to be stained and/or threadbare. The beds are great  was one of the main reasons we booked a Sheraton. The one thing that started our stay on the wrong foot as our check-in: it took over 30min to check-in and they would not take my Starwood Preferred Number because I booked thru a consolidator (aka travel agent). I explain to the front desk that I did not expect to be credited the hotel room charge, just any extra charges I may incur (parking was $30/day!!! + internet connection $10/day, etc). He still did not want to put in my number. After a 6hr flight, I was not in the mood to argue, so we let it go.Keeping in mind that the hotel is a city hotel, the room size was OK, small if you compare it to resort type hotel rooms. There didn't seem to be enough staff for the guests, all the staff we saw were always busy helping multiple people at the same time. The concierge was not very helpful; when we asked how to get to Muir Woods, she just waved us to the pile of maps.When we go back to SF, we will probably not stay at this hotel, although they have the best hotel beds we've ever slept on.

<Content>Average Hotel This hotel is in an excellent location, perfect for exploring the wonderful Fisherman's Wharf and surrounding city. Hotel claims to be a 4* although i would say it was more a 3 star. Hotel is in a noisy location with a bus depot near the hotel and so constant noise of buses was quite annoying and hotel on a number of occasions smelt of petrol due to the amount buses/cars letting off exhaust fumes.Swimming pool was an average size and hotel restaurant was very average with only a small, uninspiring menu.Rooms were adequate. Beds were very comfortable but overall rooms were small.Hotel staff were friendly and hotel was generally clean.Overall about the worst 4* hotel i have stayed in terms of room sizes, decor and facilities

The staff at the front desk was very friendly and accommodating. We enjoyed the lobby lounge and the friendly staff working there. Hotel is located in a good location. It was a short walk to Pier 39 and a half a block from the trolley stop. Overall nice stay!

<Content>There are better choices in the area. I wish I could give this hotel a better rating because the staff was very accommodating. The restaurant was excellent and the waiter couldn't have been more friendly. The location is also very convenient.Now for the bad. Don't believe what they tell you about the renovations not being disruptive. Half of the hotel is still covered with scaffolding, including the buildings around the pool. If you can get a room away from the construction you will probably have a better opinion than I do about this hotel. The first room we were assigned was on the fourth floor in the executive section, which costs slightly more. Don't bother. They were pounding on the outside wall when we arrived and workmen were sitting outside the window with electric saws, etc. This went on for three hours before we requested a different room. Also, the room was in terrible condition. Two lamps didn't work, the wallpaper was peeling and the blinds were water stained. The front desk should be more aware of which rooms are affected by the construction, in my opinion.We tried to call the front desk to request a new room and were on hold for fifteen minutes before finally walking down in person. Once there, they were very accommodating, but we had to downgrade to the second floor. When asked about the premium paid for the 4th floor, he said that it was a wash because the new room had a balcony. Well, it did, but it was level with a roof of air conditioning units and had no furniture on it. That didn't really matter, but we should have received a discount. To be fair, the manager sent up a bottle of chilled champagne to make up for it, which was nice since we hadn't made a scene or anything. The new room was in MUCH better condition and appeared to have been renovated recently.The supposed executive room was identical to the standard room, so don't waste your money just to get an ergonomic chair. The regular room had the same desk and internet connection (for $10 a day). The property is old and the bathrooms are microscopic and the amenities provided are the cheapest available, I'm sure.Again, the staff was great. They let us leave our car in the driveway until we checked in so we could move it to the cruise parking garage. They didn't charge us anything, which was nice. The hotel is easy walking distance to the cruise port, which was our ultimate destination. We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant and found it excellent both times.Unfortunately, the staff can't make up for this dingy, chaotic hotel. There are many hotels in the area and I'd recommend choosing any of them over the Sheraton.

<Content>Much Improved I had stayed here on business a little more than five years ago, and it was awful. When my current company decided to hold a 4-day meeting here, I was concerned to say the least. I was delighted to find, however, that the hotel has completely turned itself around. Although the outdoor pool was not fit to swim in (the pool man said there was too much dust around to keep the water pristine) the pool deck area was a fine place to relax or conduct small meetings. The guest rooms were spotlessly clean and refurbished daily, and the bed was, as others have stated here, excellent! Fisherman's Wharf is not an attractive area, but I was not disturbed by any noise at all.

<Content>great location poor room Approaching the hotel looks very magestic and granduer. Reception very smart, but from there it goes down hill. The room was very basic and 80's looking, the place needs a big modernisation to bring it in to the 00's. Breakfast is reasonable, the only real plus is the location it is very close to all the main attractions. There is alot of outdoor work taking place so be weary of the views from these rooms. Bring a jumper when your in san francisco it does get windy and sometimes cold.

<Content>This was a nice clean hotel, we had a great time This was our first time to San Francisco so wasn't to sure on what to expect.The front desk personel were very friendly and let us check in before the normal 3pm check-in time.I had found a internate site that let us upgrade our room to the fourth floor Club level that included continental breakfast and hor d'oeuvres in the evening for a really great rate..We had a double room that was very clean and nicely decorated and had enough room for us to have a rollaway.The beds are so comfortabe and and it was very quiet.The restaurant was a little spendy but there were many different eating places around us so that was o.k.I think that the Sheraton Fishermans Wharf definately was worth the money and the locatin was the best for exploring the city..We would stay there again...

<Content>Great location, great beds, expensive parking I just returned from a weeklong trip north up the CA/OR/WA coast and stayed at the sheraton fisherman's wharf on June 5th. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you are looking to utilize the ferries out to various point (Alactraz, Sausilito, Tiburon, etc). Now that Sheraton has made the sweetsleeper beds a permanent fixture of their hotels, you will certainly gets a good nights rest. The only real downside to the hotel is that the parking, while perhaps on par with New York City or any other equivalent city, is pricey. To park overnight, either self-park or valet, it will set you back $32. Looking back, I was glad I only spent one night since $32 was about 1/2 of what I paid for the actual room via priceline. Nonetheless, the hotel lived up to my expectations of a Sheraton and the location cannot be beaten if you are playing tourist while in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Location, but ....... Stayed at Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf because I was attending a conference in the area but wanted to get my starwood points. That said this property has a few quirks. The refurbishment seems to be taking for ever. The public areas have a distinct 70's feel and need some updating. As with others that have reviewed this I can say the beds are great, air conditioners noisy, ammenities a bit stingy, bathrooms straight out of the brady bunch, but room service very generous and nice. And the restaurant in this hotel may not have views but certainly has the best steaks I have ever eaten! And I have eaten hundreds they are just melt in the mouth. The front desk also needs more staff as there seemed to be a perpetual line up to check in or out which makes negotiating the lobby a bit hazardous.That said its smack bang in a tourist area has all the bells and whistles, is not a resort so you only sleep and shower there so it fulfills its purpose.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel My wife and I stayed 5 nights at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf starting Memorial Day weekend. I'm not sure you could have a better location for Fisherman's Wharf. The bay is 1 block away with Pier 39 only 2 block west. Also only a few blocks from one cable car turn around and 6 blocks from another (along with Ghiardelli Square and the old Del Monte cannery). The hotel itself is OK. The rooms are normal size for the type of city (space cramped cities like SF and New Orleans) but are clean. The toilet area of the bathroom is small, but manageable. There are 2 countertops in the sink area so that is much better. There was construction at the hotel (as other reviews have stated, the hotel is undergoing renovation), but we never even heard a worker. I want a nice place to stay, but I don't spend much time during the day in my room, so construction doesn't bother me. There really are no views from any of the rooms in any of the hotels in Fisherman's Wharf anyway. Other than the bellmen who were great, the rest of the workers all seemed OK, nothing special. Parking at $32 for 24 hours is the same at all hotels in the area. Overall an OK to nice hotel in a perfect location. Only other option for us would be the Tuscan Inn across the street.

<Content>Good location and value We stayed at the Sheraton for one Saturday night in May. As other hotels were charging double the rate, I booked for $139 on AAA. The location is ideal if you have activities at Fisherman's Wharf, one block away. The hotel is three story and occupies a small city block. The facilities and rooms are well-decorated and the staff is most accomodating. Parking is at a premium at the Wharf with public lots charging $22+ at day and the hotel $30, but with return privileges. If street or construction noise bothers you, request an inside room. On the weekend, there was not construction but the scaffolding was in place on one side of the hotel. The street noise would be prevalent at most of the hotels on the Wharf. For our purposes, the location, price and the Sheraton quality was a good match.

<Content>A pleasant stay We arrived in San Fran wondering if we would be unhappy with this hotel after monitoring the reviews of the property. We are generally pleased with most Sheratons and decided to give this hotel the benefit of the doubt, with the idea to relocate to another property if we were unhappy. While the rooms are in need of a facelift, they were clean and comfortable. We found the staff to be very courteous with the exception of one individual in the club lounge. We expressed our concern with the management and he was very apologetic and seemed to take our constructive critism seriously. The location of this property is great ! Based on our experience, we would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Good location, Sub-par hotel This place actually did the impossible. It made us actually WANT to leave San Francisco. My wife and I stayed here at the end of our trip and expected a lot more from a Sheraton. This place was tired, worn, noisy and all-told (as if you can't guess) extremely disappointing.We'd figured that Fisherman's Wharf would be a good place to round out our visit to the Bay Area. While that may be true, the same cannot be said for the Sheraton San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf. The place is desperately in need of a facelift. We were upgraded to a suite and I hate to think what our regular room would have been like. This one was straight out of that '70s Show - albeit without the burnt umber. All light blues, sky blues and steel blues, and felt very worn. The carpet was old, the furniture needed an upgrade, and the soundproofing was poor. Never mind the rooms next door - even with the windows closed, we could hear people outside. They might as well have been in the room with us. I generally trust Starwood properties. In most cases, hard to go wrong. When I learned that this one is a franchisee, it made more sense. Why Starwood wouldn't want to exert more control over such a prime location as Fisherman's Wharf in SF is beyond me. If I were running the show, I'd want to make it a flagship property. Clearly they do not. Whoever IS running it needs to get their act together.All told, I was very disappointed and the only reason this place gets a 2 and not a 1 is location. That said, there are likely better options in the area.

<Content>Very Poor.. When we arrived (late at night), there was scaffolding all over the place, then we got put in the worst room in the hotel. The wallpaper was peeling off the wall, and our room was cramped and overlooked a bus depot where they were reving and reversing buses all night. Combine this with the fact that we had a really big single glazed window that did not seal perfectly - and we had a 0% chance of getting any sleep.EVENTUALLY we got moved to another room, but speaking with ANYONE in the this hotel is a total pain. All the staff are VERY poorly trained in my opinion, and for most of them, English does not appear to be their first language...Anyway - we were just getting over this hassle, when the dry cleaning in the hotel lost my cardigan. It was not an expensive cardigan, but what really rubbed me up the wrong way was the fact that they lost it, and then would take NO responsibility for having done so. I had to speak to at least 5 different people, and it was insinuated more than once that I was making things up - even though the item was clearly printed on the docket! To cut a long story short - a security guy (who I was forced to give a full statement to) promised to email me when he found out what had happened, and surprise surprise, over 2 weeks later - I have heard nothing.

<Content>Considering the location We were there 4/9 - 4/12. Considering the location, it was easy to overlook the small imperfections. We should have had a pool view, but due to the construction, we had our doors covered with plastic, no light or view. (But the housekeeping insisted on opening it each day.) The beds were AWESOME! I slept like the dead and can't believe how great they were. They made the bed everyday and there were fresh towels and refills of the soaps if necessary. The coffee was also restocked. I think it was worth the rate...$110.00 for what we got. I have stayed in much nicer hotels in the past, but if you are going to San Francisco, you don't want to see your room. It is super close to the Wharf, and Pier 39, and the buses are cheap and convienient.

<Content>Bad Experience.... I stayed at the hotel in the middle of January and I picked this hotel since it was close to Fisherman's Wharf. My family reserved two rooms on the club floor and nothing was served on the club floor. It was no different from the other floors and I payed extra for the extra services. The rooms were connecting, but they were doing extra loud construction outside of the rooms. The hotel was not completely sold out so they could have put us on a quieter side. Another major complaint that I had was that the comforter was badly stained. I don't know what it was exactly, but who would want to sleep on a bed with nasty stains? I left a note on the bed for the housekeeper so they could change it, but when I returned it was left unchanged. The carpet was somewhat stained also, and the wallpaper was peeling (practically hanging) and it was not a great stay at all. One last thing was the front desk was very rude. The lady that helped us as we checked out was did not make us feel as though we were customers. She had a very bad attitude towards us. One of the worst experiences I have had staying at a hotel. I do not think they should even be apart of SHERATON because it will only bring the name down. I would not recommend this hotel to those that want a pleasureable experience.

<Content>Not bad, not great I just read the review from the Brazilian posting on March 29th, and I was staying at the hotel the same time. The hotel was PACKED all week long. It was spring break, tourists everywhere, and there were children running around everywhere. The entire staffed was visiably stressed out. Australian teenagers (10-15 at a time) going to the front desk to literally ask for four quaters for a dollar. It was insane. In light of the situatation, I can see how the staff let some things slip. I was there on business, and a little smile, a how is your day going or even a $5 tip for the concierge for being helpful made everyone relax a little. The hotel is under construction. You're not going to get a view. Even without the construction, there is no view. You're not staying on the bay. It's a good location, if you're a tourist and walk to walk to touristy places. Business-wise, and cool neighborhood wise, don't bother. It's ALL about the tourists. Rooms are pleasnt and spacious, the beds are SO COMFORTABLE, the gym sucks, the business center was not open at good times, the bar was good. The staff was overwhelmed when I stayed there. Was the service good? Not really. They should have staffed up for the busy week. I stay at Starwood properties over other hotels, and this one was not on par with what I expect from Starwood.

<Content>Except for the location... The Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in the US (and it is far from being the cheapest). We have been there from 3/16/05 to 3/19/05. They treat their guests in a very bad way. Since I am traveling with my family, we asked for adjoining rooms, but even though the hotel wasn't full, the best they could give us was two close rooms facing a bus terminal. I advice you not to get rooms facing the buses because they are really noisy, even during the night. So we asked if we could change rooms the next day but no one answered or left a message for us. People from the valet are not polite also, and parking in the hotel is expensive, $36 per day ($32 + taxes). There is a parking in a mall right in front of the hotel that charges per hour in a maximun of $25 per day.The housekeeping was one of the worst things, since they didn't clean the rooms, they just made up the beds. We used the vine glasses and after housekeeping they were left the way we did. The same happened to the coffe maker. We made one international call, and for three minutes we were charged $44!! The same call with a prepaid card in a public telephone costed $5.The worst thing was the bellman when we were leaving. We called for someone to help us with our luggage and after 20 minutes and almost nobody checking in/out nobody came, so l went to the belldesk and asked again. After more 15 minutes nobody appeared, so I called again and the guy was very unpolite and told me that I should wait because he was alone. We were just so pissed off with this hotel that we got all our luggage from the room and put it in our car by ourselves. The bellman just kept talking in his cell phone and didn't do anything to help us. The only good thing about this hotel is the location, it is 5 minutes walking to Pier 39. I really disencourage anybody to stay in this hotel, it's really not worth it!

<Content>Enjoyed the Sheraton Stayed here for a business/pleasure trip for three days the first week of March. Location is perfect for touristy stuff, within five minutes to Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf/Ghiradelli Square. Got a Club Floor room for $115 per night with Starwood points upgrade. The breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres were a wonderful perk. I took plates of goodies to my room and ate at my leisure. Also, Safeway grocery store right across the street and Club rooms have refrig to keep food and drinks fresh. There is little need to buy expensive food out unless you want to. I had no problem with the construction work, but street noise (even on the fourth floor) is very loud at night. That is really my only complaint. Bring ear plugs if you are sensitive. Room was big and very clean. Rooms very insulated from noise inside the hotel. Bed wonderful. All staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>OK but pricey We have visited SF on two occasions and on both have stopped at this hotel.The hotel is is a good location (in some respects) as it is very close to Fishermans Wharf, and the accomadations are reasonably good.On the downside we had a few problems. One of them was that common hotel bugbear - people who let their doors slam no matter what the hour. This seemed to have improved by the time we revisited and the hotel had fitted better damping on the doors. Another problem was that as the hotel is only 2 or 3 stories high, you are never very far away from the street. In particular I would not be very comfortable on the ground floor especially as the area that the hotel is in is not the best. Noise is also a problem with one side of the hotel in particular being located adjacent to a bus depot and this was very noisy.The hotel is not particularly cheap and parking is extortionate ($30 a night) so I would never consider stopping there if I had a car.On the whole this hotel is OK and did not detract from our experiences in San Fransisco which we loved.

<Content>Good Location - but lacked style Spent 4 nights there at the beginning of March - had been previously warned by the hotel that there were building works going on and these caused no hassle to us. Is in an excellent location for Fishermans Wharf (I don't think you could get closer) but the rooms were very bland/basic. I would recommend this hotel but would say don't expect anything glamorous.

<Content>wonderful stay My son and I just got back from S.F., and we stayed feb 19-23, 2005. We stayed on the 3rd floor, and yes the hotel is under construction, but it didnt affect us at all. The lobby has a wonderful, warm, cozy fireplace. The rooms beds are like everyone says..wonderful. Coffee maker (very important for me), cable tv are in the room. Room Svc is reasonable, but we chose to walk downstairs and order and bring dessert back to the room. Hagen Daas ice cream was hot apple pie was a great end to the long day of walking a wonderful city that I can't wait to go back to. I will definately be staying at the Sheraton again. I don't have anything negative to say, other than this one lady in the bar area, very rude....and I did complain about her. The hotel immediately gave us vouchers for b/fast the next morning. The concierge told us of Pergamino's on columbus, (walked to it from the hotel), and the best waffles ever! That b/fast was memorable. Very close to everything, F/wharf, pier 39, and pier 41 is the best place for crab and chowder, less expensive than pier 39.

<Content>Its in a great location We sayed there on feb 4th and 5th. Got a great rate via Hotwire. We got bumped to a room with two full size beds (instead of a queen) as place was full (tourist groups). That was not so good.  The room was nice and what you's expect. They are doing some remodeling by the pool but I went swimming anyway and the pool is heated and I enjoyed that.  Its very close to the fishermans warf area and we walked to north beach.  We did not try the restraunts.  Parking is expensive but thats the way it is in san francisco so get over it.  Its a very satisfactory hotel.

<Content>Great Place, few complaints We spent the week before Christmas on our Honeymoon at the Sheraton. GREAT LOCATION, ROOM NICE, AWESOME BED!!! We booked online and were told we would get whatever room was available. I called in early and requested a non-smoking room with king size bed. They told me they would see what they could do. It was exactly what we asked for, and they threw in a bottle of wine to our surprise. We didn't drive so the parking price wasn't an issue. We ate one night in the restaurant and it was OK. THERE ARE PLENTY OF RESTAURANTS ALL OVER, including an IHOP across the street so that didn't bother us. It was a great location, with bus stops right out front, right by Pier 39. I RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL IF YOU GET A GOOD PRICE ON IT.

<Content>Parking ripoff spoiled my visit I just moved out of San Francisco about a month ago and was attending an event there where we would be consuming alcohol, so as a responsible adult, decided to book a hotel for the evening. Also thought this would be a treat... a night in the big City for us (now) suburbanites, so I was looking forward to this. Checked in early (admit that was my first mistake) and got given a smoking room with 2 beds as opposed to the non smoking King I requested. A surly check in clerk pointed out that as I'd booked on Priceline, they didn't know what I wanted (really???) I did manage to switch to a non smoking room later in the day when the aforementioned desk clerk was off and another one was on! Even then though, they offered it as a possibly non smoking room (they didn't seem to know if it was or was not, and I had to go take a look for myself). The same surly clerk also informed me there would be a $32 charge for parking. I was horrified. Especially when I discovered this was exactly the same rate as the general public pays for parking at the public garage. So no on site parking and no price break on it for guests of the hotel. Frankly, that stunk.My other beef was that in a 4 floor building, which seemed very full of guests (judging by the number of people around at all times, and the problems I had getting a non smoking room), there are 3 elevators, only one of which was working. No signs indicated that only one was working, but all the guests had figured it out, and the front desk staff seemed unconcerned.No shower cap either provided in the bathroom!! :-)I'll end on a positive note. The bed and bedding were very comfortable... I guess Sheraton has made a big push in this area, and it was very nice. Also, in spite of the hotel's busy location, I felt they'd done a good job of noise reduction in the room, as we were not bothered by street noise unduly.

<Content>Loved the hotel! Hated paying more than others for parking! We just got back from a beautiful weekend at Fisherman's Wharf. While the hotel is pricey, it's convenient to everything and the service is fantastic. The hotel is undergoing renovations, but don't let that keep you from staying here. The beds are soooo comfortable that my husband and I were interested enough to possibly buy one - unfortunately they're custom made only for the Sheraton. There's 2 cleaning times a day (1 is a turndown). We stayed on the Club Level which gave us continental breakfast in the a.m. and appetizers at night. Also included in these 2 food times is Starbucks coffee with the big cups to take yours away. This saves a few dollars if you love Starbucks as I do. Now the bad part. We were'nt told about paying for parking as guests prior to our arrival. It was $32.00 per night + 14% tax if you're a hotel guest. That means as a guest you pay more to park your car than some tourist off the street using the same parking garage! My suggestion is to park your own car and tell them you didn't drive, or find another garage to park in for far less money and hoof it to the hotel, or park your car at a BART and take the BART into the city. Parking was our only complaint.

<Content>Wouldn't really recommend unless you get a GREAT deal We arrived to find that our room was on the street level and EXTREMELY loud with tour busses right outside our window. In addition the room was quite small. Went back to the front desk and inquired about a quieter room and was told nothing was available since the hotel was under construction. Ultimately we were offered an upgrade to a quiet, larger room for $50 plus tax. He could tell we were unsure so he offered to throw in breakfast. The new room was quiet although hardly larger. Breakfast the following morning consisted of coffee, some pieces of fruit, a few croissants and some cold cereal in the concierge lounge. The gentleman in charge there was extremely rude. At exactly 10:00 he proceeded to kick everybody out, even those who were still eating their breakfast. We ended up grabbing a banana and a cup of coffee on our way out. Overall it was ok, but hardly worth the $200/night we ended up paying.

<Content>Brilliant Holiday at the Sheraton! Firstly, I would like to say to all you people who have moaned endlessly about The Sheraton Hotel - GET A LIFE!My family and I stayed at The Sheraton in Fisherman's Wharf from 27 Dec 2004 to 3 Jan 2005 and were initially very worried due to all the negative reviews which had been posted on the TripAdvisor website. At the end of the day, we came to the conclusion that there are obviously people out there who just like to simply moan about anything and everything. Well, our advice to you guys is to JUST IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!We were called in the UK prior to our flight to warn us that renovations were currently being done at the hotel and that there would be some scaffolding up and around the outside of the hotel. Virgin advised us that the hotel staff were trying to move people around so they didn't have a scaffolding view.We arrrived after a 10 hour flight at 15.00hrs (which was 11pm UK time) and were feeling pretty tired. I asked Edita on Reception if there was any chance of an upgrade. She obliged straight away! She was very helpful and we were checked in within 10 minutes!When we got to our rooms, my mum, dad and sister's room had scaffolding outside their window, but the room itself was lovely. Two king size beds, a roll-away bed (which we had requested) all the extras you would expect. Mine and my husband's room was also lovely, exactly the same as my mum  dad's room, expect no scaffolding! And the beds - well they were just so comfy. Plenty of pillows - my favourite being the small Sheraton pillow - it was so soft!The Sheraton is a brilliant location. Right near pier 39 and 41 and only a couples of blocks away from the cable cars.The hotel food is great and although not cheap, is very good quality! Afterall, we were on holiday, so we treated ourselves!The lobby is lovely with a georgous fireplace to sit and relax in front of. The buffett breakfasts were $15.95 for as much as you could eat - well worth it. We went along to the IHOP to see if it would work out cheaper, but it worked out roughly the same price, so we had breakfast in our hotel each morning.I could not fault this hotel if I tried - everyone there was so helpful and they always had a smile on their face!I would definitely recommend this hotel and if I returned to San Francisco again, I would definitely stay at The Sheraton!Ignore all the negative reviews! If you are due to visit this hotel in the near future - trust me - you will love it!

<Content>Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf OK Spent Christmas week at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf in SFO. It was OK, but room decor was shabby. Bed was incredible---best I have ever slept in, but duvet was covered in a jarring bright blue, while upholstered furniture was a ragged turquoise. Drapes were unbelievably soiled and worn. Bathroom was comfortable and well-stocked with amenities. TV had only 15 channels with some favorites, like food channel, missing. Even on the third floor, and I had asked for a room away from the bus garage, there was still a lot of street noise, especially as the busses turned the corner right outside. Location was great---only a couple of blocks from Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf and I felt safe walking in the neighborhood. Food in dining room was horribly over-priced. At breakfast $6.95 for a granola and yogurt parfait, that consisted of a scoop of yogurt dumped in a bowl, 1/4 cup granola dumped over it, and about 4 strawberries. At other Sheratons I have seen this dish served in a soda glass, with lots of goodies attractively layered. Lobby was attractive and nicely decorated for the holiday season. George in bar was friendly and remembered my preferences after my first stop there. On the other hand, he wasn't exactly overworked. There are several other hotels in the area and I would check them out before reserving again.

<Content>Good location I used price-line to get a very good rate on this hotel. The location is excellent. We walked to the wharf and beyond. I was first apprehensive because there were so many poor ratings of this hotel. When we first checked in we were told that there were no more non-smoking rooms. We were given the worst room in the hotel. Right next to the bellhop blowing his whistle all day, and the room stank. I complained very nicely and was given a room on the second floor that was bigger and didn't smell. I guess a little persistence pays off. The beds are so comfortable and have an abundance of pillows. For the money (it would have to be less than $80.00 since parking is $32.00) this hotel was worth it.

<Content>Most Comfortable Beds Ever My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton for 4 nights in June and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious enough for the two of us and the decor was tasteful without being excessive, and as for the beds..... they truely are the most comfortable I have ever slept in - we have a very expensive bed in the UK so I am not exaggerating.The food in the hotel may seem a little pricey compared to some of the restaurant chains in the wharf, but you get what you pay for and we were very impressed with the quality of the steaks and the freshness of all the ingredients. The location is excellent and a good base for sightseeing. I can see others have criticised the hotel but I guess that some of these people may always have something to complain about wherever they go.Dont be put off by negative reviews - we thoroughly enjoyed it - much more so than the Luxor in Las vegas!

<Content>Ideal Base The hotel was ideally placed for seeing all the tourist sights. We were one block from Pier 39, and one block from the cable car into the city centre. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff could not have been more helpful. The rooms were very nice and the beds were possibly better than my own bed at home. We only had breakfast in the hotel once as it was fairly pricey for what it was, but we were recommended the IHOP restaraunt which is just round the corner and is a great way to start the day. If you want a hotel that will act as a base for a few days in SFO, then the Sheraton is a good choice.

Beds are so so comfortable.2- Nice outdoor heated pool.3 - Nice restaurant, as well as bar. Monday nights they have bud-spud-steak for $12.95 - beer-potato-steak. Good deal.4 - Location is the best. Close to all Wharf activity. Five minute walk to Trolley.5 - Friendly staff, great concierge desk - and when Sheraton tell you if it not right, just pick up the phone and dial 0, and we will make it right. And they actually mean it.

<Content>Acceptable but not 4* We stayed at the Sheraton during November 2004.It is ideally located for the tourist but our initial impression was a little disappointing. The rooms and corridors are tired and need updating.However, the staff were professional, helpful, approachable and polite. The restaurant is a pleasant place to start the day and the bar is ideal for wrapping the evening up.Before traveling to San Francisco we stayed at a 4* hotel at London Heathrow. I have to say that it was of a much higher quality than the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf (and cheaper).Would I recommend this hotel - yes I would but be prepared for 4* service but 3* accommodation.

<Content>GREAT LOCATION IN SF I had an enjoyable four night stay here in Nov, 2004. The hotel is a short walk from Fisherman's Whaft  Pier 39 where many excellent restaurants are located. There's also a supermarket across the street. The moderate sized rooms are attractive and the bed was very comfortable. There's a concierge desk for tours. The front desk staff were courteous and helpful. There's a restaurant in the hotel with daily specials. An excellent choice for visitors to America's most interesting city.

<Content>Really disappointing This Sheraton is run by a franchisee rather than Starwood and boy does it show! Every aspect of our stay was disappointing. Fishermans Wharf is a loud area, but the windows and walls were so thin that we could literally hear conversations on the street from our top floor room! The suite we stayed in hadn't been updated in a long time. The furniture was threadbare and cheap, the linens coarse and the bed not very comfortable. The suite had a bar area, but both of the refrigerators there were broken. We eventually found that here was a working fridge under the sink in the bathroom, but who would have thought to look there?Parking is incredibly expensive ($34 per day + 14% tax) and you have to wait on line for the parking clerk to validate your ticket or to get the valet every time you want to use your car. The only good thing I can say about our visit was that unlike many hotels in SF right now, there were no stiking workers out front. Do your homework to make sure you don't have to cross a picket line to get to your room.

<Content>Sheraton Okay Just got back from a wonderful time in San Francisco. The hotel was okay-a little run down as stated in the other reviews but overall it was fine. The location was excellent and everyone was helpful. Other hotels that looked very nice and close were the Best Western Tuscan Inn (I don't know the price, but it look wonderful for a Best Western), Radisson and Holiday Inn. These surrounding hotels looked newer from the outside. If the price is the same, I'd say go to a nicer hotel. The hotel is simply okay. I have a 5-yr-old son and the location is excellent for the little ones. San Francisco was just as great as everyone said it would be.

<Content>Save your money On our way home from Disneyland, we decided to splurge a little, and stay at a 4 star hotel in San Francisco over the Halloween weekend. This was a mistake. If only we had researched the San Fran hotels as much as we did for Disneyland.The only thing this place has going for it is it's location, and rather comfortable beds.The $200/night room gave us a somber view of a bus terminal, complete with garage that had those deisel engines firing all night. My inquiries into another room were met with little or no concern, with the clerk advising me that there were no view rooms available due to the height and location of the hotel. But surely there must be something away from the bus terminal...but no. The room itself was small, and lacked a fridge and microwave ( a necessity when traveling with kids). The toilet didn't work properly, the halls smelled of smoke, there were cigarette butts on the ice/vending room floor. The restaurant food was a joke for the cost, even the bartender had trouble mixing a simple cocktail (2 tries, gave up and got help).The concierge was kind enough to give us directions to a dim-sum restaurant that had been closed for a week due to renovations.Parking is way too expensive at the hotel, although not much better elsewhere.On the morning we were to check out, I had decided I was not going to spend another dime in this place, but was not allowed to bring up the luggage carrier to our room, nor load our bags into the van in the parking lot (insurance reasons?)Fortunately, we spent most of our time outside in the beautiful weather, enjoying the spectacular sites of the Bay area.When we come back to Frisco, we will not be staying at the Sheraton.

<Content>Should be Motel 6 We stayed at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf on July 4, 2004 and what a mistake. The people who give this a high rating must be used to Motel 6. $200 for an 8 x 10. Non-smoking, forget it. Everything seemed to be smoke friendly. Parking is next to impossibly and for a nice fee they'll store your car. The only plus is it's near the Wharf/Pier 39 etc.

<Content>Could have been better My husband and I spent the week of October 24 in this hotel. It is in a great location - I loved how easy it was to get to just about wherever we wanted to go from the wharf area. The Sheraton also has a very courteous and helpful staff. However, the rooms were small and a bit old, run-down and tired looking. I expected more from a Sheraton with a four star rating. I found myself wondering when the rating was given. We never did try their breakfast buffet, because it is, in my opinion, expensive. Fortunately, there is an IHOP right across the street where we had breakfast every morning we were there. Overall, we had a lovely time and absolutely loved San Francisco

<Content>Best Place to Stay My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf during our vacation in October, 2004. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel advertises their beds as being the most comfortable beds away from home and they are 100% correct about this. They also have a very nice sports lounge with courteous staff. I loved everything about this hotel - especially the location which was within walking distance from Fisherman's Wharf. Our stay in California was the best!

<Content>Lovely Hotel and Excellent Location We have read many varied reviews of this hotel. We have to say that we were very impressed with the hotel, the service, the location and the overall experience. We took advice from trip advisor users and asked for a room away from the bus terminal which was granted and as we were on the second stage of our honeymoon , as we arrived at the hotel a bottle of champagne was awaiting in our hotel room which was a nice touch. To explore Fishermans Wharf , there can be no better location than the Sheraton and it was not even affected by the local strikes that hit surrounding hotels. We can only speak highly of this hotel , the staff and the management.

This hotel is perfect for the tourist who wants to see all of San Fran.Fab location literally a 3-4 minute walk to fisherman wharf but in a nice quiet well lit safe area. I don't know why everyone has given this hotel really bad reviews beacause i found the staff to be great (even got a room upgrade on arrival) and the beds were the most comfy hotel beds i have ever slept in(new sheraton sweet sleepers). overall i found this hotel to be fantastic, ok the resturant and bar is a little pricey but your not made to eat/drink in them. i would most definatley stay here again.

<Content>Not much better than a Motel 6 I expected more from the Sheraton. Their staff was rude, the beds were hard, and if they didn't forget to leave tea bags, they forgot stirring sticks, sugar, or cups. One day we returned to our room and there were ants all over the coffee counter because the maids did not clean up.Parking was extremely expensive at $30 something a day. We could have stayed at a less expensive place for the same exact quality or even better.For a better stay I recommend the Nob Hill Hotel. The rooms are tiny, but very clean and comfortable. It feels very San Francisco.

<Content>Great Location - That's it The only good point about this hotel is it is close to Pier 39. I got a room on first floor, right by the road. I could hear buses and other auto traffic going by all night long. This hotel did not cheer me up, it is kind of dark and made me depressed. It is situated right off a main road, you don't really get any quite moment. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. Also they ripped me off with $30/night parking fee and their restaurant was very expensive. You don't need to dine here since there are so many restaurants in the area.

<Content>Much better than expected From the reviews I read here, I did not expect much, but was pleasantly surprised.We did get a quiet room as requested (not on the side of the bus terminal!). The room was nicely decorated and very clean, everything worked well. The two double beds were broad enough for four people and very comfortable. The rooms vary slightly in size: ours was a little bit larger than the usual standard room. Also, the staff was very helpful and friendly.We did not find anything to complain about!Parking is very expensive at the hotel with $32 plus tax as overnight rate, but a slightly cheaper parking garage is just across the street (Walgreens, Safeway).Also, the location is great! Try the Cafe Pescatore, a very good Italian restaurant - moderately priced - across the street.

<Content>Find the maintenance man! Stayed here from 24th - 26th Aug. From the outside the hotel looks shabby and in desperate need of a lick of paint. The lobby is much brighter and attractive. Our room had new beds and linen and if it weren't for these the rooms would look very tired. Our bathroom had a cracked sink and cracked floor tiles. Some of the staff were very helpful and friendly yet a couple were miserable.The pool was fantastically warm and lovely for a cold evenings swim. The kids loved it!Alcatraz - When you go to get tickets there will be a notice saying sold out for a week, however, don't despair, if you go down to the ticket office on the Wharf at 7.30am on the day you want to go you will get tickets as they keep an amount of tickets by for last minute sale. Make sure you make the effort because it is a fantastic day out - well worth getting up early for.

<Content>Good location....old hotel The Sheraton is in a great location, very easy walk to the waterfront, attractions, and good seafood. But the hotel is old and needs to be updated, the rooms were pretty clean (nothing noticeable) but all the linens, towels, carpet, iron, etc were very old. If you don't plan on spending time at the hotel or in your room, then the location would make this hotel ideal. But if your expecting to relax in a nice hotel, then I would go else where. San Francisco is a great city and we will be coming back....but not at the Sheraton.

<Content>Could have been better.... We stayed there in Feb, 2004  I expected much more fr Sheraton. The lobby is beautiful, however that's pretty much it, the rooms aren't that great, kind of small. The location however is excellent, just a short block to the Wharf! The staff not too friendly. The restaurant in the hotel lobby is excellent, but pricey. I would go back there, not expecting an upscale Sheraton but an average standard hotel.

<Content>Basic, but clean and friendly We stayed here for 3 nights (8th -10th Aug), just the right amount of time to see what we wanted. Having travelled from Las Vegas, this hotel was always going to be second best! Check-in was efficient and it was good that my request for a quiet internal room had been granted. We had a view of the pool, but it was too cold to sit around it whilst we were there. Pack a jumper as it was exceptionally cold for August!The location for Pier 39 was excellent, we ate out every night. The cable car stops were within walking distance, we found the conceirge very helpful. You have to ride the cable cars and do a trip to Alcatraz but make sure you book well in advance. We booked before we left the UK and found that tickets were scarce once out there.We were glad we stayed in Fishermans Wharf rather than Union Square, but it's worth a shopping visit!

<Content>Very Clean We really enjoyed our stay here. The room was nicley decorated and extreamly clean. The location is great for doing the tourist thing. The cost for parking is high ($32.00) a day, but welcome to San Francisco, it's the same everywhere.

<Content>Great Location, needs upkeep Sherton is in a great location for the Warf and Pier 39. The public areas are bright and shiny, beautiful flowers and generally gracious staff. However, it is time for the folks at the hotel to do some upkeep.The bathroom/sink areas of room were bright and shiny. Linens were clean and crisp, but the room needed a fresh coat of paint on the ceiling and absolutely needed new curtains. These were draw string and the cord was filthy and the curtains stained. The AC unit needed the vents cleaned.Location WONDERFUL...Upkeep SAD

<Content>Great Location, loved it Even tho reviews were not that favorable, we stayed here. The staff and hotel could not have been nicer....There is a small complex of stores (Walgreen's and grocery, etc) across the street. This was great, as we processed all my film for a bargain price, got muffins for breakfast and snacks. All at non-tourist prices. Walking to Pier 39 and 41, was a breeze.

<Content>A great base for your San Fran experience.... We stayed at the Sheraton for 7 nights recently and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel having read the reviews on this website.The location is second to none, a short few minutes walk from the Wharf area and excellent transportation links a block away that can whisk you to Union Square in 10 minutes.As for the hotel itself we didn't encounter any of the dated facilities that others have had problems with. The lobby area is immaculate and the front desk staff extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The room was above average size with two double beds which were perhaps the comfiest we have ever slept on. They brag about the Sheraton Sleeper Bed and I can see why now. Excellent. The bathroom area was nicely decorated in a nautical theme and the power shower is up there with the best I've experienced in the USA.Downsides to the room, the wardrobe and chest of drawer space was a little lacking. Air Con was a little noisy but that was it. Sure there was a little traffic noise outside but nowhere near as bad as we were expecting (perhaps we got lucky on room allocation).Only real negative was that our adjoining room we had booked wasn't made up according to the front desk and we were told to go down for the key to this room a little later. It turned out it was made up and we had to go back down to reception to get the key which was a little annoying although only 5mins out of our holiday. A small problem.All in all I wouldn't hesitate to book the Sheraton again. Good accomodation, great staff and excellent location. What more could you want?

<Content>Great location My girlfirend and I stayed here for five nights in June 04.The Sheraton is in a great location. You are just one block or so from the cable car turnaround and a short stroll from the tacky, but tourist central Fisherman's Wharf. (Be warned though, if it's great nightlife you're after look elsewhere, the area goes dead from about 1030.) The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and there is an adequate pool area.The room was clean, modern and a very good size although the walls are a little thin and you can hear conversations in the next room.But all in all a great place to stay in San Francisco.

<Content>Sheraton should kick it to the curb Booked 3 nights through hotels for Jan 04. Checked-in. Checked-out 1.5 hours later. Booked a King, received a double. Terrible aqua-colored blanket on bed had many holes and cigarette burns. A/C unit was moldy and dusty. Room looked like it had never been dusted. Bed was uncomfortable. Room smelled musty. Desperately needs updating. Charged me for one night anyway. Took 6 months to get my money back from Sheraton corporate. Don't bother booking a room here. Stay downtown and take the cable car.

<Content>Wouldn't stay here again We stayed here on Memorial Day. We got one of the worst rooms, I am sure. Two double (not queen, double) when we requested a king. The room faced the bus station (LOUD) and the bathroom stunk like mildew.The beds were very comfortable but sooooo small that my husband and I slept separately. The whole room was tiny.When we return to SF I doubt we'll stay in the Wharf, but if we do we will stay at the Hyatt. The lobby is much much nicer and hopefully the rooms are too.Also we didn't go to the pool but I wanted to add it was in shade the entire time. I bet it is always too cold to go in the pool, except maybe August?PS We paid $70 on priceline for the room.

<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton... This past Easter Break (April 2004) my family and I stayed at the Sheraton in Fisherman's Wharf for a part of our week long stay in San Francisco. The hotel was really nice. Close to everything as far as sight seeing goes on the Wharf and all the tour meeting places. We ate at the hotel restaurant,The Compass Grill and the food was very good. Wewere disappointed with the breakfast buffet, though. We found there was lots to do nearby and also found a great restaurant on the pier called,Scoma's. It was excellent!! The extended cable car tour was very good as were the many different tours to Napa, Sonoma, Alcatraz and Chinatown all of which can be arranged very conveniently right at the hotel. The staff was helpful in making recommendations for restaurants in Chinatown, etc. as there are so many. We would stay there again. Also it's right across the street from IHOPwhich was a great place for a nice breakfast.

<Content>Great location We were very happy with the room and beds and found the facilities to be very comfortable. Only problem was a lot of outside noise from an adjacent parking barn for city buses. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Location was excellent for public transportation access and great for walking to many pier attractions.

<Content>Noise Problem - Otherwise Adequate Spent 5 nights at this hotel in Aprl 04, arrived to find only smoking rooms available although requested a non-smoking. Room allocated was a corner second floor room which overlooked both the garage and road. At 5.00 am the roads got busy with buses and trams resulting in the room becoming noisy and the lamp on the bedside continually rattling.Went down and cmplained to the front desk who admitted that this hotel does have a noise problem, after a discussion with the room allocator (very helpful) and duty manager (not so helpful) we were put in an internal facing room on the 4th floor. Whilst the outlook was the plant area for the hotel, it was much more quiet.Rooms are very spacious and extremely clean, beds as described were very comfortable.Would consider this hotel again at a push, much nicer to stay nearer the city centre. Fishermans Wharf at times looks tired and is smelly.

<Content>Not worth the money My entire family (6 adults and 3 children) stayed at this hotel while in town to attend my sister's college graduation. We picked the location because we wanted easy access North of the Bay. The hotel was not up to Sheraton's standards, at least what I've experienced at other Sheraton Hotels. Our rooms were not ready and they could not give us rooms close together. The free cont. breakfast was a HUGE joke, thank God there was a IHOP close by. The rooms smelled and needed to be updated. We asked for a crib and I don't think it would pass federal safety guidelines. Security was non-existent as the door from the parking area into the hotel was broke so anyone could freely enter. The majority of the time we were there the parking gate was open so you could park free, but we were charged a daily rate (not fair!). In order to use the pool, it would have to be 100 degrees and no wind. Don't stay there just because it has a pool (our mistake). One good thing is that if you like to walk, this is a good location for that. Our view was of the parking lot, I don't know if any of the rooms face the water. Since we paid A LOT for our rooms, I would stay outside of the City next time and get more bang for our buck.

<Content>dissapointing We have recently stayed in this hotel and found it really dissapointing. It did not live up to the normal sheraton standard.The rooms were dark,with small old fashioned bathrooms.The bath was stained and scratched and the washbasin was outside of the bathroom.The heater/air conditioning unit was poor with mould growing on the inside of it. The beds however were very comfortable with down pillows and cosy matress. There was no view from the room, in fact we kept the curtains drawn to avoid being overlooked by othe guests across the courtyard. Our childrens room was worse.The expelair unit in the bathroomdid not work,therefore the room was damp and had a musty smell.This room looked out ono he street where passers by could look in if the curtains were left open.There was no safe in either rooms,which was a bit of a nuisance as we had to carry valubles and money about with us. The breakfasts in the hotel were quite good if not a little pricey and the menu for dinner was very limited and expensive. We wished we had not chosen this hotel for our stay even though it was in easy reach of Fishermans Wharf.It was not four star in our view.

Okay, as far as quality i'm not going to knock them we enjoyed our stay. it's a great location. staff very friendly, 1 block from pier, however a six day stay here was far more than needed. saw everything within 3 days. you can only take but so much of the wharf. finally rented a car to see more of the surronding area. we had a rate of $99.00 per night which is adequate for this hotel. not as bad as some viewers rate it to be.

<Content>Smelt like sewerage - sounded like buses Stayed here way back in October 02 but have only discovered tripadviser and felt I needed to share our horrible experience in the Hotel. We have been to US number of times and picked the Sheraton because we have always thought they were good hotels. Were we dissapointed. We had been to San Francisco twice before but had always stayed at Union Square and thought it was about time to check out Fishermans Wharf. When we arrived they told us we had a room with 2 double beds even though we have specifically booked 1 king - we could get over this, but when taking the long trek to our room the whole hotel smelt really bad (we later found out the area has a sewerage problem). We opened our window to air the room but found we were directly opposite a bus depot and a bus stop was directly under our window. We enjoyed a walk around Fishermans Wharf and dinner that evening and then a completely sleepless night listening to bus tires being changes and buses being revved up. We left the next morning (even though we had paid for 3 nights) and returned to the Handlerey at Union Square. Do yourself a favour and stay at the Handlerey and get the cable to Fishermans Wharf (Oh and take a gas mask!).

<Content>Great location I stayed 4 nights 5 days at the Sheraton and am undecided whether I enjoyed my stay at the hotel or not. I was there with two other guests who had no complaints, but I am a bit more selective.The reason we choose the Sheraton was because of its location. We had considered going to a cheaper hotel, but decide to stay at a reputable chain. The hotel is located in a great spot, only a short block from the wharf. The Radisson by the way is across the street from the Sheraton, and you can get a room that has a view of the Wharf. Though, I don脗 t think the rooms will be as nice.The room itself was adequate, with two new double beds, TV and Internet access. Though I hated the bathroom. It looked clean, didn脗 t smell, but still it wasn脗 t what I was expecting. The beds where brand new and very comfortable. As I mentioned earlier, you really can脗 t get a good view of any of the local attractions from the Sheraton. If you stay on the 4th floor, and are on either the west or east end of the hotel, you 脗 may脗 be able to see something?If a 5-star hotel, luxurious room, and a view aren脗 t what you脗 re looking for, then the Sheraton is a good option. It脗 s a short block from Pier 43 脗陆, the ferries, and 3 minutes away from Pier 39. The cable cars are 3 blocks away, so is Ghirardelli Square. If you are going to buy any cheesy souvenirs, buy them from the shops, which line the base of the Radisson Hotel. They are cheaper there. You can see all of the sites in 3 days, though you will have to plan your trip accordingly. It脗 s best to take a day tour of the city. The hotels concierge has pamphlets. We went on one and loved it.Two pieces of advice, if you don脗 t like the room you have, you can literally hit 10 hotels within a 4-block radius of the Wharf. Second, there is a ton of homeless people at the Wharf. For the most part they are nice and harmless. Though, there are a couple of troublemakers. Its best to just ignore them, and don脗 t stop for anything if they persist.

<Content>Great bed This hotel advertises their bed as a selling point. It was very comfortable. The hotel itself was average in it's service  ammenities. It's a great location to stay if you just want to walk out of your room  be near the tourist attractions and great seafood restuarants. I would stay there again if they offered a special price. We paid $89.00 and it was worth that, but not much more.

<Content>'A' for location, 'C' for everything else What struck me as odd was the disparity between the overstuffed furniture/fireplace/charming staff in the lobby and the hard mattress/budget bathroom fixtures in my room. San Francisco, more than anything else, is a walking town. At the end of the day (or night) of pounding pavement, one would think a bed is a bed is a bed. Not so. Fortunately, you can't beat the location: 1 block away from Wharf and trendy North Point neighborhood (Columbus Ave/Broadway) is a $5 cab ride away.

I've stayed at the hotel on two seperate occasions, and it has been the best bargin I have ever received by far... in any country I've traveled... well there is a hotel in Prauge that may be a better bargin given it's location.The location of the hotel is a 2 -3 minute walk to the Wharf. Little Italy is seconds away. The cable car turnabout is a minutes away, and Safeway is across the street!Go Sheraton ... it's your birthday!!

<Content>Noisy location, uncomfortable beds...don't bother We had a comp stay here recently (but still had to pay the room tax, plus the hefty $30.00 per day parking fee). There are parking lots less than a block away for $15.00 per day. The room was clean but small, and no better than what you would find at Motel 6 or Super 8. The noise level (don't get a room near the motor court!) was unbearable at night, with cars arriving, valets yelling, homeless people swearing. The beds were extremely uncomfortable, rock hard. We are locals but it is appalling to see how much the tourists get ripped off. Better to check out some nicer hotels in Union Square or quieter area, then take cable car to the Wharf.

<Content>Probably wouldn't stay here again We probably would not bother staying here again. Although the lobby looks nice, the staff was rude and the beds felt like we should be the Flintstone's sleeping on a bed of rock. View was not good. Ours overlooked a bus-stop and bus terminal with several loud homeless people hanging out. Although, it is in an easily accesible location. It's fine to stay a night or two, but see what else is out there!

<Content>Great location with great rooms! We spent the last two nights of our holiday here and were really impressed with the efficient check in service and 'feel' of the hotel. Room was spacious and clean with great facilities - just would have been nice to have had a fridge for what we paid! We spent two other nights at Union Square at a hotel that was half the price, and although this hotel was far more superior - we did feel for the amount of time we actually spent in it - it was quite expensive and probably didn't utilise the hotel to its full potential. Howver, for luxury, a great surrounding and somewhere to get a drink at the bar when you return from your meal out - it was great. The concierge staff were also very friendly and helpful! I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a clean, friendly, comfortable hotel, somewhere to relax and within walking distance of Fishermans Wharfe.

<Content>Not drab, merely elegant My wife and I stayed here for two days in June. From a tourist point of view, it was the right place to be. Close to all the things you must see and do whilst in the city. The staff were friendly and helpful and I must agree with another reviewer, the concierge was the best we have ever come across. We wanted to visit the Japanese Garden in Golden Gate Park, and the directions given for the bus and metro were absolutely precise and easy to follow, even to the point of telling us which direction to go once outside the hotel. Full marks! The rooms were a good size, well appointed and a fridge was available if you wanted it, and it was quiet, unlike many city hotels.

<Content>reat Location Very good location. 1 block from pier 39. Very clean rooms. Not a good view. None are on Fishermans wharf until you go outside. Don't rent a car. $30 bucks a day to park at the hotel. Cable car 2 blocks away. Street car? Catch it out back. It's the best deal $1 with a transfer ticket. Safeway across the St. Add the fridge for $20, Safeway will pay off with food and alcohol. Ihop across the st. We took the Alctraz + City tour and wine tour. Both were excelent from all american tours. Get a map of the city and you have a blast.

<Content>Sheraton - Second to none This hotel was fabulous. Stayed 4 nights in June whilst visiting SFO and was not dissapointed.The Sheraton is 1 minute from the Wharf and the Piers, and only 5 minutes from the trams ready to whisk you off downtown.Service was superb, and the staff were most helpful. Rooms were excellent, with good choice of TV, air con and a marvellous 'nautical' feel.Bar and meals were delightful. Have no doubts that when we return to Frisco this will be our place to stay.Marvellous, and for a reasonable price.

Thoroughly enjoyed the stay and the room was very comfortable, and very well equipped. There are no great views from the rooms but with so much to see and do and fishermans wharf on the doorstep you will not notice the lack of view. Breakfast was lovely with a great choice, service second to none, nautical theme throughout the hotel made it really feel like you were at the seaside! Would certainly stay here again when we return to SF.
