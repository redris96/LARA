<Content>Disappointed... After reading all of the glowing reviews of the Beverly Laurel hotel on tripadvisor and expedia I was pretty optimistic about my selection. On arrival the check in was fast and easy, the desk clerk cordial but not very knowledgeable about the area. We were assigned room 109 and proceeded to park the car. The parking situation is dreadful albeit free. The hotel has approximately 50 rooms and there aren't even half that many parking spaces available. When you are lucky enough to find an open space the maneuvering needed to be done is pretty ridiculous as the garage is extremely small. The open air alleyway parking stalls aren't much better as several of them have significant dips that causes the undercarriage of your car to scrape the pavement. The room itself seemed okay at first glance, decently decorated with a king size bed. We must not have been assigned to one of the remodeled rooms that others have talked about here earlier. The bathroom was old and in desperate need of repair although the shower was extremely large and big enough for two. We did experience a minor ant problem on two different occasions which seemed to be limited to the bathroom area. The fridge and microwave were ancient and should be replaced. The bed was very comfortable and provided a good nights sleep. With the setup of the hotel you can hear everything that is taking place outside, sirens, voices, doors slamming, etc; earplugs would probably be a good idea. The hotel does have a good location going for it although we did notice several homeless people sleeping in front of stores in the area of beverly and fairfax. We ate at Swingers for breakfast on one occasion, the food and service were good and I would recommend giving it a try. I would probably look elsewhere in the future even though the rate of $125 a night is not over the top. I chose this place over another hotel in the area primarily because of the free parking and would not have if I had known the problems it presented...disappointed.

<Content>Unxepectedly Disappointed. Whenever I choose a hotel, I check TripAdvisor at first, because the reviews are very depandable and accurate. However, Bevery Laurel Hotel was an exception. I don't understand why everybody gives 4 and 5 stars for this place. It's just an old motel with Hollywood style funky furniture. Our bathroom shelf was broken, the lines were very tired, toilet tank had dust and hair... I didn't feel comfortable.Also, you hear loud street noise, which I thought was a storm all night.One good discovery was the diner on the ground floor, Swingers. Good price, good food and good service.I highly recommend this restaurant.If you are looking for a clean well-maintained hotel, you might not be so happy with this one.

<Content>Great location and nostalgic We took a road trip to Los Angeles on a budget and this was the perfect place! We chose the Beverly Laurel because they accept pets. The property is well manicured and extremely nostalgic! The pool and landscaping was a true throw back to the 1960's. The rooms are not the most luxurious rooms and have very little amenities but they are equipped with a fridge and microwave. Free parking was a plus. Most importantly, the location was amazing. We were close to everything! The Grove, Chameau (great French Moroccan restaurant we walked to), Farmer's Market and Boutiques.I would stay here again and again because it was easy and the price was amazing. We brought our own snacks and drinks for the room and Swingers (great diner) was right downstairs. If you are looking for luxury, don't come here. If you are more interested in a great location and don't plan on spending much time in the room this place is perfect.*Bring your own soap and shampoo. Their selection is pretty basic.

<Content>Retro hotel with great location! We booked this hotel after hearing great reviews towards location and were not expecting that much considering the price however we were extremely impressed!!Contrary to some reviews on here we found the amenities to be great, new bathroom with wet room style shower, two clean soft double beds, nice subtle fifties decor and all you need for a comfortable stay.We are not saying this hotel would rival the 5 star hotels in the city but if you're a fan of retro/vintage this place is a must and the price cannot be beaten! The Swingers diner downstairs is great for breakfast too. Location as said before is great and I would recommend going to the Farmers Market round the corner and Fairfax/Melrose are great for vintage shopping by foot.

<Content>Not fancy but just right First off, the Beverly Laurel is a motel--but that also means parking is free, unlike many LA hotels. There's no fancy room service or shower head, you don't get 10 pillows for each bed, and I'm guessing the sheets fall short of 300-thread count, but the Beverly Laurel is a decent value in a great neighborhood. You almost don't need a car when you stay here. You can walk to great restaurants at the Grove, the Farmer's Market, 3rd Street, Beverly Blvd., or La Cienega. Shopping is nearby as well. This is one of my favorite bases in Los Angeles, and I'll come back time and again.

<Content>Old school? Or just old? I'm not sure why I booked the Beverly Laurel - I think I read something about it in the LA Times travel section. We (me, wife, 8-year-old daughter) stayed at the BL the nights of August 8-9. First things first - don't let the name fool you; this hotel is not in Beverly Hills. It is on Beverly Blvd but that doesn't make it Beverly Hills. The surrounding neighborhood isn't bad (although most of the houses have bars on the windows) but it sure isn't Beverly Hills.We checked in around 3:30 Friday afternoon. The manager (owner?) is very friendly. We had reserved a non-smoking refurbished room. We asked for something quiet (not facing the street) but he told us this wasn't available in a refurbished room. He could tell that I was disappointed with this news so he upgraded us at no charge to one of the refurbished studios that face the alley in back. The cost of the room was $119/night plus LA hotel tax plus $2/day energy surcharge; parking is included, which is very rare in LA.My wife gasped when she heard our room number as this room has been the subject of a bad previous TA review.We never had any trouble parking and only had to go into the underground garage once. All of the parking is covered - others have mentioned that it is a tight squeeze but much of the tightness is due to people not properly parking within their space. There is no security for the parking garage - even the underground area does not have a gate or any noticeable security cameras.You are reasonably close to everything - The Grove is less than a mile away as is Fred Segal (on Melrose).The hotel looks old - it is old. The hotel does not have a web site but there are pictures of it floating around on the web. The pictures of the refurbished rooms are flattering - the reality is much less flattering. Our room had been refurbished but that word means different things to different people. The room is old and it looks old. There is no dresser so you will have no drawers in which to put your clothes. The flat panel was nice but it was not HDTV and the remote didn't work (we didn't bother contacting management about this). The kitchen area is small and looks really old. The fridge is a step up from a dorm size fridge but still very small. There is all kinds of light coming into the room, especially around the door. The a/c is a wall unit that blows cold but is very loud. The bed was not very comfortable and the pillows are the worst I have ever had at a hotel (not much bigger than what you get on an airplane).The bathroom is reasonable in size and had been refurbished but still looked old. The towels will bring back memories of gym class and the toiletries ... well ... let's just say that you should bring your own. All you get is a bottle of really bad combo shampoo  conditioner and the cheapest little bar of soap that I've ever seen in a hotel. The water pressure is good and there is plenty of hot water.With the exception of the a/c unit the room was quiet at night although I can imagine that if you face the street and are close to Swingers that it will be noisy. From what I can tell room 303 is furthest away from any of the noise so that might be the one to request.We tried the pool but didn't last long in it as it isn't heated. Even as I child I didn't like cold pools - I'm certainly not going to change that opinion as an adult. The pool water appeared to be very clean.Swingers is OK - the price isn't bad nor is the food. We ate one dinner and one breakfast there - I don't feel a need to ever go back because there are just far too many great places to eat in LA.I got what I paid for in LA. If you are expecting this to be some hidden pocket of luxury in Beverly Hills for Motel 6 prices you will be sorely disappointed. But if you understand what you are getting then I think you will like this hotel

<Content>Oh yeah!!!!!!!!! I booked a room with Beverly Laurel for one night, and I must say this place, location, and price cannot be beat. Steps away from Fairfax you have eveything you need walking distance. The place even has a diner called Swingers that is open from 6am-4am. When I checked in the manager Robert was great. Down to earth personality he made me feel safe with no surpries. I was given a kind size bed and the room was spacious with a micowave, fridge, and a little kitchen. Everything in the room worked, ac, tv, warm/cold water. The bed was well along with the pillows. You can even get high speed internet service for $6 per day ( you cannot beat that). The pool was clean. My only down fall was the bars of soap the hotel supplied were no good. Meaning they cracked right away, but everything else was great. I recommend this to anyone young, adults, couples, guys night out, girls night out.

<Content>Great place for our Wisconsin relatives We stayed here for our son's wedding which took place in the Silent Movie theatre about 1/2 mile away. We were very pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and uniqueness of the rooms and friendliness of the personnel and the location. It was great for us because we didn't want to drive if we could help it in LA. The Farmer's Market/shopping centers/Hollywood/walk of stars etc were all very close. We would highly recommend it. The size made it easy for our group to contact each other.We booked online so had no real idea what it would be like, but it was great for us. The renovated rooms had a 70's feel and were very nice. Wish I had known about the kitchen units which would have worked better for us. Also, the Swinger's restaurant on site was fantastic

The location is also great, right in the middle of LA, in a clean, safe neighborhood and everything is a short drive away.

<Content>Outstanding value  Stayed there over President's Day week in Feb, 2008, paid under 100/night for room with 2 queen beds with AAA discount. The front desk told me they also have a few larger rooms. The room had a microwave and a small refrigerator that smelled, but did work. The place is in an outstanding location, as many others have noted, very near Farmers Market/Grove, CBS Studios, Beverly Hills, Beverly Center, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, etc. Our room was very clean, well lit and the beds comfortable, though the furnishings were a bit tired and a remodel of the bathroom would not hurt. We had no real issues that needed attention so I can't comment on the service, though the front desk was friendly and our room was always made up. They have a small restaurant on the premises -- we only had breakfast there but it was pretty good. It is apparently pretty hopping on a Saturday night. Two other things are worth noting:1. The pool is tiny and won't get much sun -- it's not something you'll especially want to sun bath next next to, IMO, and I don't think it would satisfy kids.2. Parking -- they have an underground lot that is extremely tight. Although I did see vans and SUVs parked there, I would be leery of bringing a large vehicle into the underground lot. They also have covered parking stalls under the building (entrance via the alley) -- these are also somewhat tight to park in and some (not all) require you to go over a sort of hump that actually scraped the chassis of my rental car, a Dodge Avenger (no visible damage, but I backed out and parked in another stall). Street parking is available but has restrictions.

<Content>slice of Americana Stayed here in April for 2 nights, though have visited and stayed here many times before. I visit LA frequently and sometimes have tried out other places at a similar price level, but always come back to the Beverly Laurel. The rooms are a good enough size, the bathrooms can be small, but they're always clean. The bed's are a good size, decor is neutral and slightly arty, the TV has plenty of channel choice, and the local phone calls via the hotel's phone aren't extortionate. And the hotel has a classic mid-20th century 'Americana' look which I really like. Staff on reception are always helpful, the parking's free and then you've got Swingers Diner on the ground floor, which is worth the stay in itself. Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever had a bad stay or negative experience at the Beverly Laurel, and at this price, I cannot recommend the place highly enough.

<Content>Location only Was there in 2006. just to check L.A. during my stay in USA. First must say that 90 $ looks too much for service you getting here. It's more like a motel and just a place to sleep, and those places are usualy not worth of 90-100 bucks per night. Yes location is good , you are close(considering that you are in city of 17 million) to many sights like Farmers Market,CBS studios(two minutes walk),Walk Of Fame, Melrose Avenue,Sunset Boulevard, even Beverly Hills with Rodeo drive(more or less 10-15 minutes with taxi),etc... If I'm right, closest shoping mall was Beverly Center (just left, 15 minutes walk), with Macy's and Bloomingdales,there is also some nice restaurants with wide price range... Room was kept clean, with kitchenette, simple bathroom, TV was old and not working,bed comfortable... All in all, if you need just place to sleep, wants solid location and cruising the city during the day, this could be it... Not delighted, but not so dissapointed neither...

<Content>Mixed opinion We stayed here with our baby. The pluses are: good location (near the farmer's market, the Grove shopping) and the Swingers restaurant downstairs is terrific. Staff are friendly and our room (with a kitchenette was large). We dragged our chairs outside in the evening and would sip wine with a nice view of the pool. Downsides: the place felt dirty. Our daughter's feet were BLACK after crawling on the carpet. Some of the untensils in the kitchen had food crusted on them. The kitchenette was undersupplied: one wine glass, one bowl, a couple of spoons and pots and pans. Not even enough to have two bowls of cereal in the morning! Don't bother paying extra for a kitchen; you'll end up getting take-out anyway. The pool gets little sun and is not kid-friendly (i.e., almost no shallow area).

<Content>Must suck to be me Elevator was dirty and smelled - the bed had cigarette holes or moth holes in the blankets. The Real BIG Surprise was @ 5 a.m. when I went to take a shower, there was NO shower head and what was there had absolutely no pressure. Now wherever I travel, that is the 1st thing I look for, so there are no early morning surprises. I called 3 wks ahead  was guaranteed ground floor near parking lot - when I arrived, I got 2nd floor at the street - front desk said take it or leave it - an overall horrible experience!

<Content>This place has bed bugs My friends and I stayed in room 321 on 4/13/07 - 4/16/07 and came home covered in bed bug bites. I have them all over my arms, face, feet and back. Not a pleasant experience and now I have to worry that I might have brought them home with me. Everything other reviewers have said about the noise is true. People laughed, screamed and rode the very noisy elevator (just outside our room) all night long. The carpets were dirty. The fridge didn't work. The night clerk was incredibly rude. When we took our complaints to the manager he very flippantly dismissed them and didn't offer to reduce our bill in any way. Disgusting place, bad service.

<Content>Great Hotel, excellent location We stayed at the Beverly laurel for 2 nights, on our first trip to America, on our way to Vegas.We wanted a place that was in West Hollywood, was fun, and was reasonably priced! From menory, it was approx US$100 a night.We read about the Beverly Laurel here on Trip Advisor, but unfortunatly, they dont have a website, so we felt like we were booking a bit blind, so we were a bit unsure about what we'd walk into!The people there were friendly, and happy to point us in the right direction for things to see. The hotel itself is pretty basic, but its clean and comfortable; it was well serviced both days we were there. Its by a reasonably busy street, but we didnt notice any noise at all. We thought it was really good value for money. It was a great intro to America, and we enjoyed our stay.There is an excellent diner downstairs called Swingers. I had the best burger that I'ver ever tasted there! I'd go back there just for the burger!The location is great, just down the road from Farmers Market (really nice), and a $10 cab ride to either Sunset Bvld, or Hollywood Bvld.We'd recomment it if you want a place with some spirit, and dont need luxury!

<Content>unfortunately there are bed bugs! This motel is indeed a great place for a great location and Swingers is a fun diner with tasty food. The noise at night is a problem but otherwise I have enjoyed my two visits there.UNFORTUNATELY, I stayed there two weeks ago and ended up with 100 bed bug bites all over my body. I smelled a sweet odor in the room and saw one bug in the bed but had never heard of bed bugs so was insufficiently alarmed. The bites blew up into welts a couple of days after returning home.I called the hotel and informed them and they said they would take care of the room (no offer of any kind of reimbursement). I would advise checking the mattress, box springs, and headboard before settling into your room and keeping your luggage sealed and off the floor.

<Content>Great Place. Great Value We stay here every time we visit our california children and grand child. (So far, four visits over the last four years.) It's a great place, very friendly and helpful management--one reviewer called the management stern -- I can't imagine whom they encountered. Robert, the proprietor, could not be friendlier or of more assistance. Rooms are generous sized and comfortable, if a little funky, but what the hell, it's West Hollywood. Pool is excellent and all the service staff very accomodating.

<Content>value for money We are a family of 5 (3 children) and have been traveling the world for a year now so we have stayed in our share of hotels.We chose this one purely due to its location and other trip advisor reviews.We have never stayed in a motel before - so we were curious about the difference.Granted this is no Hilton but is great value for money.1. It is clean. Our room was located on the second floor in the corner. No smells what so ever, clean towels and sheets changed daily2. It is quiet. Surprisingly so due to the fact that a popular restaurant is located on the ground floor.3. It has a pool. A necessity for 3 young children at the peak of summer4. It has a kitchen. A bit sparse on the cutlery and crockery but enough for some breakfast - we wouldn鈥檛 cook major dinners though5. It has a television. Not all 100 or so cable channels but enough to keep us all entertained6. Room was spacious. Enough to fit 6 large suitcases plus all of us.Now there were two double beds. We are used to a queen so was a bit tight for us. Mattresses were a little squeaky for two - pillows could do with some updating as well.Otherwise great value for money.

<Content>Great Value Hotel! We were initially put off by the fact that the hotel had no website or online contacts so when booking from another country it is hard to know what you are getting into. We stayed at the Beverly Laurel on a one month tour of California and it was fantastic. We had stayed at more expensive hotels during our trip but this was by far the best. The bathroom was great with twin head showers and a double basin. The rooms were clean and the staff were really helpful. The location is also great with The Grove shopping centre just a short walk away and Beverly Hills and Hollywood in close proximity. For the money I couldn't recommend it any more.

<Content>you're paying for the location My 2 daughters and I arrived in LA from Las Vegas and booked into the BL after reading the tripadvisor reviews. Well all I can say is that this is a 50 buck fleabag motel which charges $60 for its fabulous location (and it really is great) Our room stank of smoke, it was in the sheets and the pillows. The 'renovation' it had undergone was very superficial as the fittings were still all 40 years old. The rooms were very noisy, the stairways dark and dingy, and we didn't feel very secure. While the staff were friendly we couldn't wait to get out of there - to a less fantastic location where $110 plus tax buys you a decent room.

<Content>not for those with a nose we stayed at the BL last saturday night, and though i had requested a non smoking room, and made a separate phone call to that effect, we were given a smoking room - but the host promised it would be okay because that room had just been shampooed. which actually meant that the carpet was wet for our entire overnight stay, all the pillows and blankets still smelled of smoke and musty odors, and by morning whatever allergens (mold, mildew) present in the carpet gave my five year old son such a reaction that he was sneezing and miserable for the next five hours.the coffee shop, however, was great. said five year old son was in love his waitress. this hotel is for hipsters like the ones two doors down from us smoking some interesting herbal cigarettes. great for college kids who have less money and dont have asthma. not so great if you want the illusion of cleanliness and fresh linens - but it's cheap! and go to swingers. oh, and all that retro style. too bad they didnt spend a little less money at dwr and a little more on some dysons.

<Content>Good, simple hotel I really enjoyed staying here. I only stayed one night, by myself on a business trip. As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe. The location is ideal, at a reasonable price, and the diner attached is a definite bonus. For those traveling here on vacation, the Farmer's Market a few blocks away is an interesting place to check out, though it's grown into a huge shopping mall nowadays. The guy at the front counter was real nice and helpful, and the rooms were clean and decent. I'd stay again sometime.

<Content>Brilliant! Fantastic location, clean, tidy, cable tv, frdige, free parking  the best diner next door! What more can you desire for $100 in la? The Beverly Laurel is a good value hotel which ticks all the right boxes. Ok, so the building is a little old, and the room was a little cold (especially in the recent storms!) but we found the hotel extremely good value. We turned up with a view to moving to the Standard or a more upmarket hotel but we just couldn't bring ourselves to leave. We ended up staying for 7 nights.Great location for the Grove or Beverly malls and convenient for Hollywood/Sunset. Also, the Swingers diner rocked - breakfast for under $4 b4 11, friendly servers.We also stayed at the Le Montrose Suite (which with parking was $170) but prefered this hands down! We kept the difference and went shopping!

It was clean and charming, a cut above the standard motel decor. I did not notice any smell or other unpleasant odors - and I consider myself quite discerning and something of a Felix Unger. Great location and I would stay there again, absolutely.

<Content>Absolutely "NOT" worth the price... I chose this hotel because of all the positive reviews I read on internet and on Lonely Planet. But I was sooo disappointed :1. First there was indeed a smell. You know the same smell when you walk into a store selling vintage clothes. It's difficult to live in it. The smell was on the beds, on the towels, everywhere.2. OK, the rate was $90 a night, but quality only worth $40. The wooden drawers were dirty and old. There were cracks here and there filled with dust and dirt. Towel racks were old with dots of paint, looked like they were covered with dirt. I had to use the towels on it and it gross me out.3. Dirty dirty dirty. I'm serious, there was blood stain on pillow case, and the pillow itself was yellowish!We stayed for a night and we quickly moved out. We ended up at the Days Inn at Glendale which cost me only $75 per night, and believe me, Days Inn was way way better!!! I don't know, if you are always on the road, always prepared to sleep at train stations, OK with not taking shower in days, then I think Laurel Hotel is good for you. But if you are a normal person who likes cleanliness, then don't ever think of going in there because it is not in hotel standard (not even motel standard compared to DAys Inn).

<Content>OK, good for the price This hotel was basically what I expected for $100 a nite in West LA. The room we stayed in was smelly, pretty bad but not unbearable. The windows were kept open most of the time. The rooms were average size, a little shabby and worn but clean. The bathroom was clean but small and only had a shower. The pool was very cold (unheated) but since it was a hot weekend, it was refreshing. The main draw to this hotel is the price and the location. 5 minutes to the sunset strip, beverly hills and hollywood and right next to the grove, we walked to the farmers market for breakfast. It was a bit far from a freeway, and of course in LA that slows you down a lot.

<Content>do not recommend at all I absolutely do not recommend this hotel. We stayed here (with our dog) largely based on the reviews on this site. we brought a scented candle beause of the reviews about smelly rooms. ours was smelly--smelled like mildew and the candle helped some. i could've dealt with the smell but the biggest problem was noise. people treated this hotel as a place to party; the acoustics are awful; and people woke us up with screams throughout the night. the hotel staff seemed to turn a blind eye.the room next to ours was rented out and was used for a play in the evening (about 9:30)! the people were yelling ----, screaming at each other, and slamming doors all as part of the play (we didn't know till later it as a play and it was not just disturbing but terrifying as well--especiallyto our dog).the beds were the worse ive ever slept on (way too soft). we slept on the floor the 2nd night (didn't have time to find a new hotel with our pet as we had a busy schedule in LA with vartious friends) as my back went out and i had to use ointment on it for most of the trip. the almost 24 hour diner below also adds noise to the hotel. this is absolutely the worst place ive ever stayed in and i am not too picky. as stated i was prepared to deal with the smell but it was impossible to get rest day or night in this hotel.to be fair, the manager did reduce our bill by some amount after we complaned about the noise and the play (about 15-20 peope were in one room watching the play and then later standing directly outside our room talking loudly about it and congratulations the actors etc)if you want rest go elsewhere, if you want to stay up late and party and dont need much else stay at the beverly laurel.

<Content>AWESOME PLACE! The Beverly Laurel is fantastic! Great location and excellent rooms. Priced right. One of LA's best kept secrets. The diner ajoining the hotel - 'Swingers' - is very funky with ever helpful staff. Only a short walk to most of LA's top shoping or attractions. Friendly staff and quiet at night.I will definately be staying at the Beverly Laurel on my return trip to the United States!
