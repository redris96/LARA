<Content>Loved the location It was a couple of years back now but i thought i would write up a review on my experience at the Andrew Jackson...We turned up (in the off season) on the doorstep just looking for some cheap accomodation somewhere convenient in the french quarter. There were 5 of us travelling around the US on the cheap and this meant sharing a room everywhere we went... Anyway, we were greeted by a Clay Aiken lookalike on the door (similar accent and everything) and due to the fact that we couldnt really sneak half of us into the room without going past this guy, explained our situation to him. He was not only cool with it but for the price of the room with only a double upgraded us into a larger, comfy room just off the courtyard. Loved the location, was a sweet room, great service and good times all round...I dont know how up to date this is and maybe Clay isnt working there anymore but i would still give the AJ the thunmbs up if you are looking for somewhere to stumble back to after a big night on Bourbon street...

<Content>Great Location We Loved the Location. I was So very Disapointed in SOME OF THE Staff. The man John that checked us in was Fantastic.. I was not so Happy on the Next time I has to deal with the FRONT DESK. My remote Batteries were dead. I called Down and asked to have some brought to my Room... That is a laugh. I was told You can COME get some IF  IF we have any. I got dressed and walk down stairs to get the Batteries. Took them back to my Room.... Guess what They did nto work... I walked Back down stairs to get 2 More. I was Asked  Were are the ones I just Gave you? I said I left them up stairs They do not Work. I was told I need them back. I was told with Attitude... I think we will stay somewhere else on our Next trip. We come to N.O. bout 5 times a year. Mike and Lisa Junot.. room 210

<Content>All I could do is laugh. The best thing I can say regarding this hotel is it's great location. If you want to be steps away from everything and are not picky, it's ok. Not good, not great, just ok. Worn is a good term to use to describe the facility. Our room was extremely small with furniture which looked like it had been bought from a roadside flea market. As everyone stated previously, the bed felt as though we were sleeping on an oak door. The hand sewn curtains and plastic mini blinds did not meet the wall, which enabled ample amounts of streetlight to bounce freely about the room. There are no thermostats, so if you get cold easily or burn up, tough. Yes, it was stated our room came complete with a bathroom. What it did not say was that it only contained a very small soap the walls and spin shower-stall with a curtain that was a foot shy of the floor. Oh yeah, very limited parking is an understatement. Enjoy their free fitness program when you are forced to walk 5 blocks in order to park your car at the Mississippi River (Parking is NOT free, Go on an add an additional $20.00 a day). Since I only live 2 hours away, we spend ample time in the Quarter every year. We have stayed several places better and worse than this hotel. The bottom line is we only paid $89.10 a night to sleep in The French Quarter(plus $80.00 parking). Notice I said sleep. The room was clean, the location was great, but if you are looking for a posh resort with all the amineties, this ain't it. If you are a go with the flow type, which could sleep anywhere just to have a good time, book away.:)

<Content>What an experience!!! I booked this hotel stay in a rush.. not reading reviews, which is important. I read the reviews after we booked(before we got there) Let me inform you of what its really like. It is in a nice area. It is one block from bourban, two blocks from decauter. The secure parking lot is three blocks away by the St. Pierre hotel. The hotel is supposely haunted. It feels that way when you walk in. I want not advise you to stay with children at this hotel. The rooms are incrediable small. The rooms are old looking. THE BED, at least the room we stayed in, ARE SO HARD. Which one review said.... We brought our own pillow and blanket. It is almost like staying in someone else's bed. The hosts were very nice, but werid! The hotel is supposely haunted by two kids... its scary. Not a comforable place to stay. It kinda smells in the hotel..Not a strong nasty smell...but just like an old smell! We were sooooo werided out by the first 4 hours we were there...that we honestly were going to eat our money and go to another hotel room in New Orleans. Also..There is NO returns for any reason.... There is a two night minimum..... I believe if you cancel your first night before you stay you only pay the rate of one night! Not exactly what I would call a nice cosy stay! Please read reviews before you stay!!!

<Content>Great location, a little worn, terrible front desk staff This small hotel has a great location on Royal in the French Quarter. It is a little worn, not the best mattresses, but having stayed in other older properties in New Orleans, this one is not that bad. I am not sure it is worth the 149.00 per night weekend price. My complaint is the front desk clerk and his attitude. He was just plain rude to anyone who asked any questions with exaggerated physical gestures. He critisized the hotel guests stupid questions after they left his presence and did it loud enough that other guests could hear. I would not go back because of this person.

<Content>Do NOT stay here! Do not stay at the Andrew Jackson Hotel. I have never experienced any hotel stay like this one in my life. I have stayed at hotels during Christmas and New Years and have never encountered anything like this. (please check my other reviews). My wife  I really wanted to stay at this hotel, instead of a chain hotel. I called the hotel on Dec. 26th to confirm my reservation of a double bed room. The staff said my reservation was fine. I told the staff we would arrive at 10:00 p.m. on Dec. 29th. The moment we checked in there was a problem. The staff told us the heat was broken in our double bed room. (the hotel web site states that the rooms are heated, it was 40 degree weather). I was told they were working on fixing it. Fine, we took a single bed room, our friend was not arriving until the next day. The next morning my wife asked about our double bed room. My wife was shown a double bed room and the front desk clerk stated the maid needed to clean the room first, then it would be ready for us. We went to breakfast, then returned to the hotel an hour later. Upon arriving, the same desk clerk informed us that we could not have the room. When we asked why, we were told we had to call Travelocity, since we did not have a contract with the hotel. My wife asked if their sister hotel St. Pierre had any double bed rooms. The clerk said no. In all the years and places I have travelled, I have never heard of being shown a room, then told I could not have it. Usually, if there is a problem, guests are upgraded, not downgraded. There was no physical way 3 grown adults could even fit into the small single bed they gave us the night before. I called my credit card company with whom I reserved the room with. After they contacted the hotel, they told me to check the hotel St. Pierre. My wife  I walked 3 blocks to that hotel. They indeed had 2 double bed rooms available (we were just told by Andrew Jackson Hotel staff there were no rooms available). We stayed at hotel St. Pierre until 12/1/08. Please read my review of that hotel. To be fair to the Andrew Jackson hotel, I emailed the G.M. after we returned home, asking why we could not have a double bed room that we had reserved. He replied that he was vaguely familiar with the situation and that he would get back with me. I never heard from him again. My credit card company contacted the hotel  the G.M. stated he would resolve the situation with me personally. When I told the credit card company he had not gotten back with me, they contacted him again. The G.M. told the credit card company that the hotel server crashed and he had no information about what happened during my stay. He offered me a 2 free night stay at the hotel. I declined. Why would I go back to this hotel? First my room wasnt available, then it was available, then after it was shown to us, it wasn't available. Their sister hotel had no double rooms available, then it had 2, but the one room with heat (in 40 degree weather) was an extra charge of $20 a night? It has taken me over 1 month to get this situation resolved  I still have no explanation of what happened. I love New Orleans, and I will go back again, but I will never stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Sorry. Not for me. We just payed for a 3 night min stay for $199 per night during the BCS National Championship game at this hotel. Please note that the French Quarter had a 100% occupancy rate, so we did knew that we would pay top dollar. The price really was not the issue. It was the hotel. I was dissappointed after reading some really good reviews of this hotel. I found it to be relatively clean but run down and definately not service oriented. Examples.. Toilet ran constantly. Had to shut off water valve. Did inform hotel staff. No hairdryer in room along with cheap bathroom toiletries that produced no suds. 2 Towels and 2 Washclothes. No handtowels. No trashcan in the bathroom. I moved the one in the room to the bathroom only to find it back in the room after the cleaning lady came through. Not a single picture on the wall - unless you consider the cobwebs as decor.A non-working remote control on a very small TV.The thread count on the sheets felt less than 200 and there were two flat pillows cheap pillows. The blanket between the awful bedspread looked to be about 15 years old. Dingy and pilled.Floor that actually sunk in. When my husband and I moved over to the Intercontinental for $97 per night, we thought we were at the Ritz compared to the Andrew Jackson.I might also note that this hotel is on the ghost tours of New Orleans. Coming out in the morning, I had some people ask if we experienced any paranormal. We did not. They informed us that the ghost tour stated this was one of the most haunted hotels in New Orleans.

<Content>Great Location, Decent Stay Just returned from a 3-night stay at the Andrew Jackson. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were comfortable. The location is excellent, a little away from the craziness of Bourbon but still well within walking distance of everything. Overall, this was a great stay. I will concur with other posters about the breakfast, it's a joke with only donuts and coffee, but I didn't care too much about that. I don't quite understand why the hair dryers have to be borrowed from the front desk, but that's not a big deal either. My biggest problems wer the lack of a thermostat in the room (I understand that it's an old building but it was either sweltering or freezing) and the first morning I was there, there was no hot water, even after I waited 30 minutes. Taking a freezing cold shower will wake you up though!

<Content>Hotel website inaccurate My husband and I just returned from a weekend in New Orleans staying one night at the Andrew Jackson. We usually stay in the Garden District because rates are more reasonable, free parking is provided, and the French Quarter is only a trolley ride away. However, the Papa Noel rate of $79 convinced us to stay in the Quarter for a change. Unfortunately, as their website states, parking is limited and we paid an additional $20 per day for parking, Keep this in mind when rates are quoted. My main gripe with this hotel is the inaccuracies on their website. No continental breakfast (only coffee with a jug of powdered creamer), no hair dryers in room, no irons and ironing boards in room. Additional negatives include flat bed pillows, scratchy sheets, no thermostat in room, and the room had only a double bed. On the positive side, the hotel is located in the middle of the French Quarter and the morning desk staff was very accomodating (can't say the same for the evening shift). Also, the bathroom in our standard room was very clean and modern. In closing, the accomodations were adequate, but don't count on the amenities described on their website.

<Content>Amazing! This hotel was the perfect stay for my friend and I. I am a frequent traveler to New Orleans, and this by far, was the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The courtyard was lovely, and had a chance to make friends with some of our fellow travelers. The staff were extremely helpful, and willing to point us in any direction for food and jazz. It's proximity to Bourbon Street and all the shopping of the French Market was perfect, but also allowed for some quiet time when the day was over. I would recommend this hotel to anyone heading to New Orleans!

<Content>Loved it! The Andrew Jackson suited our needs perfectly (two of us)! Great staff, very clean, good and cool a/c (that's the one thing that I am really picky about!!) and PERFECT location. Having the 24 hour A  P just right down the street was another plus. If you are sharing the room w/ more than 2 people you might find it a bit cramped; rooms are tiny but very adequate in every other way. Our room opened into a small courtyard w/ a fountain which was helps lend to that NOLA flavor. Rates are so cheap I felt guilty. If you need blow dryer or iron, just ask the front desk. If you aren't looking for spaciousness and luxury this is the place for you!

<Content>Enyoyed our stay My wife and I stayed here when doing the Jazzfest and found no problems with anything.Our room was on the first floor in front.They have very limited parking but there are public parking lots not far away.I found our room simple but clean and with a nice feeling,especially the spaciousness that a 14-foot ceiling provides. The staff in my opinion really made every effort to answer any tourist-type questions about the city,we had many. Location is super,lots of shops and reseraunts a short walk away.Whatever past problems they may have had have been dealt with.I would love to stay there again.

<Content>Love New Orleans Went to New Orleans Feb 17-19th. Picked Andrew Jackson because of its name and location in the Quarter. I loved it. Yes it is small, but I was not there looking for a Holiday Inn. I love the small and quaint. Staff were more than helpful. Price was great. Location was fantastic. Could walk to Bourbon Street in only a minute or two (only one block over). I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is up for adventure and NOT just looking for a place to impress someone.

<Content>Do Not Stay Here This hotel has so many problems, I do not know where to begin: our room was not clean and the furnishings were sparse--the mattress was horrible. We did not have a remote for the small TV--no biggie, but when we requested one from the staff, it never arrived. The courtyard rooms were loud and if want to sleep in, forget about it....there was so much light coming through the gap in the front door, it was impossible. The staff was not helpful and really rather rude. There are many wonderful places to stay in New Orleans for the right price--this place is definitely not one of them.

<Content>Wonderful Time in N.O. after Katrina!!! Visit and see for yourself!! My husband and I went to New Orleans for a three day weekend in mid January and had a great time at the Andrew Jackson Hotel!! They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. For the price, location (heart of the French Quarter)and service, this hotel was excellent!!! It is not a Ritz Carleton, but we enjoy staying in places that are historical and fun. With beautiful balconies, high ceilings, clean bathrooms, cable and a comfy bed this place was wonderful!! We never had trouble with parking and the front desk staff were incredible! I was even given a flower by one incredibly nice employee when he discovered it was my birthday. He went out of his way to stop at a flower shop on his way to work and purchase a beatiful stem for me. It brightened my day and was nice to have in our room. It was a very safe and convenient location. I would recommend it to anyone who wants the true New Orleans experience.

<Content>Great anniversary getaway! This was our 14th wedding anniversary trip and the first time without any of the kids along. We stayed in the King Suite with a balcony on the second floor. It was fantastic! Eating breakfast out on the balcony as the sun rose and then in the evening having some drinks before going out. The room was very spacious and the bed quite comfortable. The furnishings were consistant with the age of the hotel. Our only issue was that the carpet seemed a bit sticky, so we just kept on some type of shoes. Not a real issue. The location is FANTASTIC! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The carriage tours passed in front of the hotel so we can now tell you the history of the hotel and the Cornstalk fence very well! Parking was as usual in the Quarter. We never did find a space in the hotel's lot or the sister hotel's lot but we were able to find parking (FREE) within 3-4 blocks and this was fine. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. At one point our toilet was not filling quickly. We called the front desk and within 10 minutes someone was there and it was fixed.I would recommend the Andrew Jackson to anyone - especially the second floor king suite with the balcony. It's a little more pricey but worth it. We have also stayed at its sister hotel - the Hotel St. Pierre- and would recommend it too. For being in the Quarter the prices can not be beaten. Our stay was 3 weeks before Hurricane Katrina hit. We pray the hotel can revive!

<Content>I tried to fly home early, just to get out of that dump! We really regret booking at this hotel. The staff could care less, the room was small, furnished with junk and the door had huge gaps all the way around it. I could not sleep, I was scared at what might crawl in the gaps. And of course there is not any parking. We were told we could park at the sister hotel, but the lot was full. We had to park 8 blocks away. Terrible, Terrible do not waste your money.

<Content>A homeless shelter is better, I bet ! Having stayed at many European hotels withOld World Charm, I thought I knew what I was booking at the Andrew Jackson Hotel. How wrong I was! I never expected the dirty, filthy, disgustingly rank room that was given to us. I booked 3 months in advance for a room with a double bed, and upon arrival, we were given a room with 2 twin beds, with room for nothing else.I went to the front desk to complain, and she told me nothing else was available. I demanded to know who gave our reserved room away and like magic she found us another room. Finally, I thought we were getting somewhere, until we opened that room and the smell was so bad I got dry heeves.NO KIDDING.The room looked so filthy I did not want to even sit on the bed. Now it is time to park. When I made reservations I was told that they had parking. When we asked where to park, we were told lot was full and we were directed to go to a public parking area about 6 blocks away.Ok so we did. She neglected to tell us that the parking was $4 an hour , and we had a 2 day booking so you do the math on about a 48 hour stay. That was the last straw, we drove back and told the clerk everything was horrible and we were leaving. We were charged for 1 night stay at a rate that was probably the highest they charge. When I pointed out on her desk was a flyer advertising roooms at a considerable lower rate, she said Those rooms are not available. What a joke.I have never complained like this about any hotels that I have stayed in..I just hope I can save 1 person the grief that we went through .Thank You.

<Content>Our spot in the French Quarter for location and value.... My husband and I went to New Orleans for the first time this month. We wanted a reasonably priced, small hotel in the French Quarter. After looking around we found the Andrew Jackson Hotel. We were pleased with what we found. Rooms were nice, courtyard lovely, rates reasonable and the staff was very helpful. The location is great so we could easily walk to interesting shops and wonderful dining. Ask for a courtyard or Royal Street room. Breakfast is simple but fresh.Kim

We received warm greetings and enjoyed a nice, clean room. The hotel is in a superb location in the French Quarter and at very reasonable rates. Our room faced Royal Street, so we sat on the wonderful balcony for breakfast each morning. Housekeeping was fine but a little slow, no real problems. We love New Orleans and we hope to come back for a much longer stay at the Andrew Jackson Hotel. Rene K.

<Content>great little place My sister and I had a girl's weekend here. We really enjoyed our stay. Now, this is not a 5 star hotel...so don't expect it! It is more in line with European boutique hotels. We were in room # 202. It had a king bed, good size bathroom, but the best was the balcony overlooking Royal St. We sat outside a few times everyday!!! The location is hard to beat. It was amazing that it was as quiet as it was in the evening with Bourbon St. just a block over. We were able to check in early, which was nice. The carpets in the room were a little threadbare, the bedspread was old, and the bathtub was snug...but hey, great price, great location, great views! I would definitely book this place again. Alas, be aware that if you go on a haunted house tour that you will stop at this hotel. Legend has it that a few young boys haunt the place, mainly room #208. Thankfully, room 202 is at the other end of the hotel!

<Content>Friendly, intimate hotel with a great location... My husband and I had a great week at this friendly, comfortable hotel located in a restored French Quarter townhouse. The location (on Royal Street, French Quarter) is great and the staff is very nice. Our room was clean and neat with a nice new marble bathroom. Don't expect a cookie cutter chain type hotel, each room looks unique and different. Our vote: We are coming back next year, we already booked our same room for Mardi Gras!Sandra P.Houston, TX

<Content>This hotel is good value This hotel is placed in an excellent position to visit New Orleans. Do not expect a Marriot Hotel. This is a quirky hotel and the furniture is lets say shabby chic. It is reasonably priced and if you go wanting to get a taste of new orleans then you will get it.I stayed in a room out the back which to be fair was small but it had everything you needed. This hotel is round the corner from Bourbon Street ... staggering distance if it suits.

<Content>Checked Out Early!!! I won't write a long review. All I can say about this hotel is that the lobby is nice and the rooms are small, drafty, filthy, dank, and furnished with crap that I would not pick-up off the corner if they were throwing it away. Don't waste your time or money. P.S. By the way; I travel a lot and at the rate that we got our room, I didn't expect much, but I have literally stayed in $29 a night motels in the middle of nowhere that were nicer than this place.

<Content>Do Not Waste your time with this hotel! My boyfriend and I stayed here in January of 2004 for the long MLK holiday weekend. It was by far our worst experience ever staying in a hotel. The room was beyond disgusting, the carpeting was filthy, my white socks were black within minutes, the bathroom was so small you could barely move in it. We were guaranteed a king size bed but upon our arrival we were told there wasn't a room available with a king size bed only a queen but they still tried to charge us for the king size room. The website bragged about what a wonderful courtyard the hotel had, it was just as filthy as our room was. And there was a homeless person sleeping in the hotel lobby every night. While the location of this hotel is great it's not worth wasting your money on this hotel.

<Content>Would not recommend We stayed for memorial weekend. Really the only benefit of this hotel is the courtyard and location. The courtyard is charming and authentic; the location is perfect in the french quarter. The hotel itself leaves much to be desired. Dirty and old. That's the only way I can describe it. We had a standard room that had just enough room for a bed.....but barely. Bathroom was falling apart. This place should be a museum....not somewhere to sleep. Didn't have a very pleasant odor either. The staff, however, was nice. There's better places to stay if you're traveling to new orleans.

<Content>has its problems, but the front desk people were SO NICE! I have to say that the Andrew Jackson hotel is quite charming, and the front-desk people were so helpful and friendly. Yes, the bathroom was run down, and the shower had absolutely no water pressure (just a trickle)...that is until we asked to have someone look at it. The next time I got in the shower, it was terrific! Also, I left some personal belongings behind last weekend, and I got themmailed back to me within a few days!!! The temperature was great for us (no control in the room was my only issue with that). The major problem I had with the place was with the carpeting. I could never walk in the room without shoes on. If they could improve the floor situation, I would recommend the hotel. Where else can you get such friendly service at such a good rate?

<Content>Worst hotel ever The one review that says the breakfast was hard donuts, lousy coffee, filthy rooms hit it right on the head here. This was my 20th anniversary and I was assured that this would be a great room overlooking the street. Room greeted us with beer can and cigarette butts on the balcony. Room was so filthy that I requested new sheets. Take off your shoes and the socks turned black INSTANTLY. The next morning painting and wallpapering took place.. called three times in advance never told about this. Did move to sister hotel which was slightly better, BUT only slightly. Shower terrible, bathroom door didn't close..the only relief we got from the room was when we left. Thank goodness New Orleans was great -this place is the worst!
