<Content>Best room in the place! We were very happy with our pool side rooms. Our rooms were a little tired but very clean. Airconditioning was great. We did meet a few people who were not happy with their rooms as some rooms do not have a balcony (3rd floor). The breakfast was good with a good variety, sometimes some of the food was a little cold though. Be aware there is no bacon!!!! Halal food only. The staff are fantastic and could not do enough for you, they treat you like a friend and try to get to know you. The cocktail night on Tuesdays is very good with free food and drinks, all hotel management are present and make an effort to meet everyone there. Like most hotels drinks are pricey, minibar fridge prices are very good though not much more than the circle k's. Ice is free from room service and they are very quick. Papas restaurant prices are exhorborant compared to most restaurants. We were at Papas in May 2008, excluding the drop in the aussie dollar, prices would of risen about 30 percent, so at present very expensive for aussies. There is building going on next door in our 16 days only a few days could we here any noise at all. A few people have commented on trip advisor about the location too far from Kuta the taxi's are so cheap and it only takes a few minutes to get to Kuta square. Good shopping, restaurants and bars are less than 5 minutes walk. We thought the location was good and felt very secure. For day trips there is a few drivers out the front of Alam kulkul that are good and cheap 400,000 rupiah for a whole day. Gede one of the drivers is very good, speaks english well and a safe driver! We would return but only if we could get a poolside room.

<Content>Gorgeous  Despite the hotel being a distance from Kuta centre about 15-20 minutes walk, the hotel's ambience was beautiful. We really enjoyed our honeymoon there and will definately stay with Alamkulkul again for our next trip. We got a room which was facing the swimming pool and the view was spectacular. Breakfast at the Bunga Kelapa Restaurant was breathtaking. Lots of variety of food available as well.Overall Thumbs UP~

<Content>AlamKulKul was lovely My boyfriend and I stayed at AlamKulKul for one week in the beginning of June 2008. We initially arrived to the hotel one day earlier to see if we could check in and they were more than helpful. The next day we were transferred to our allocated room where we booked a Holiday Package which included 4 days, 3 nights in an Alam room, buffet breakfast daily, 2 dinners (food only) at Bunga Kelapa Restaurant and Papa's Cafe for two people. Both onsite. 1.5 hours Papaya Body Polish at Jamu Spa for two people (the BEST massage I have ever had in my life!), also onsite. This costed $335 USD, extra nights charged at $80 per night. I suggest booking directly with the hotel. Email communication was prompt and extremely helpful.Rooms were cleaned daily and 2x600ml of water were available for free daily. We didn't require our room to be cleaned daily so we put the Do Not Disturb sign on our door knob. Bath towels and pool towels available, so save the room in your suitcase for souvenirs!We booked a tour to Ubud through the hotel's travel agency. It cost 600 000 rupiah and included driver, fuel, stops at Celek for silver jewellery, Monkey Forest, Art Galleries, Woodcarving Galleries, and a sunset dinner at Jimbaran Bay. Food is on top. You can customise your tour, however, notify the travel agent at time of booking.The location of the hotel is at the northern end of Kuta, so it is quieter than central Kuta, however, not as quiet as Seminyak. It took us approximately 10-15 minutes walk to central Kuta.Overall, our stay at AlamKulKul was awesome! The staff were so friendly and helpful. I 100% recommend this hotel!

<Content>Nice I stayed in the Alam kulkul in from Jan 29th. I was there with my girlfriend and we both had an amazing time. The Travel office was really good, because we were able to book a few tour throughout bali with them.The service was excellent and the staff were very freindly. The poolside bar came in very handy, they even came out to the back pool to send us food and drinks. the breakfast was also very good each morning.Kuta square is a fair walk (especially in the heat) but its not hard to get a taxi as they wait out the front of the hotel for you to come out, and thats on a 8,000rp trip which is nothing. otherwise you can just walk around the corner and your can see the shops in legain which are just as good.The location is really good as its located on the beach, and if you want to go for a quick swim its no stress to get back quickly to the hotel.Papa's cafe was excellent. Me and my girldfriend went there most nights as it was easy to get to and the food and staff were very nice. from Papa's you could go anywhere you want from there.This hotel was just what we were looking for.I have some photo's but i will put them up a bit later on.

<Content>Nice relaxing boutique hotel - we love it It鈥檚 unfortunate that we could only get two days out of the three in Feb 08 that we wanted in this nice and comfortable but small boutique hotel. We were certainly quite impressed with the hotel quality and its value for money. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were shown to a small room where the check-in desks were located. We were then given cool wash towels to refresh ourselves and welcome drink vouchers that you can redeem at their bar at any time. All the staff were quite polite and helpful throughout our stay.The hotel is located on a one-way street, away from the main Kuta shopping area and across the road from the beach. Being away from the hustle and bustle, gives it a more secluded relaxing feel鈥ery much a world on its own. A taxi trip into town is quite reasonable; about Rp15,000 (about US$2) each way. Alam Kulkul definitely has a Balinese feel to it, as there are lots of statues and potteries set out in its garden outside the rooms. The gardens have a few varieties of local tropical fruits which you are welcome to help yourself to, if they are ripe. Our standard Alam room was located at the back of the complex, facing a small swimming pool and being on a ground floor had more of a resort-feel to it. I had a good time swimming in the pool, but unfortunately my partner couldn鈥檛, due to 鈥榯hat time of the month鈥? The room was reasonable sized, slightly dark but well furnished with a comfortable king-sized bed. The concrete bathtub was slightly old but large enough for my partner and I. Mosquitoes are a bit of a problem in the room as the plants/gardens and the damp weather do tend to attract them. The room do have electric mosquitoes repellent but we ended up asking housekeeping for an insect spray which they gladly provided.We had a relaxing time in AlamKulkul and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants value for money, enjoy a boutique hotel with a Balinese feel but don鈥檛 mind the location.

<Content>Just ok Well my travel agent raved about this property, but there are some plus and negative points. Firstly if you are going to stay there, pay the extra and stay in the villas. I didnt go into one, but on the outside they looked spacious. The Alam Room that we stayed in was at the very back of the resort, and is quite a long walk from the front. Our room looked a lit tired, the bathroom was very small and a little slippery on the tiles. The bed was really comfy, but I thought the room was a bit pokey and old looking. So the resort has two pools which arent bad, the big one had builders hammering away all day next door which was annoying. The food at the restaurant isnt bad. Papas cafe at the front is much better. A big problem is the location. The beach opposite is nice, but its a long walk into Kuta, and to get to any restaurant or shopping area is a long walk too, not much fun in the heat. I wouldnt stay there again. We walked up and had a look at the Bali Mandira that looked lovely, great grassy area out the front and good pool. I had a facial at the day spa which was lovely, my husband had a massage and really we should have asked for a refund, the therapist would hav stopped and walked out at least 5 times during the hour - very unprofessional.

<Content>It's OK We stayed for 3 nights and when we checked in, we were given a room next to their sewage system. (3101 - avoid) They came to spray with lots of room freshener but didn't help! When we ask to change rooms, got ourselves away from the sewage but still a room without much view and a worn bathroom. Breakfast was nice - they serve up until the very last customer leaves. We always come right at the end of the breakfast time so this is important. Location is far out although still in Legian/Kuta- hardly walking distance to restaurants/ shopping.Probably will not stay again

<Content>Excellent Stay - No problems whatsoever I along with my wife and two daughters stayed here for 4 nights and we liked this hotel very much. It has a real balinese touch. The staff is very friendly and always helpful.The breakfast was excellent. We are pure vegetarian and hence had very less choice, however on request the staff without any hesitation arranged vegetarian food for us.Overall our stay at Alamkulkul was excellent and would undoubtedly recommend this hotel for stay.

<Content>Hmmmm Wouldnt stay again Recently on my second trip to Bali I stayed at AlamKulKul for two nights before heading to Nusa Dua.On my previous visit to Bali I had stayed at the Hotel Bounty which was cheaper and alot nicer! Upon checking in in an odd reception - a small desk in the corner of a large room which wasn't inviting and didn't look professional - we were shown to our room. The initial problem was the dark, dingyness (thats with lights on).The bathroom was in a bad way - just really old and discoloured with cracks everywhere and a shower that hardly had any water coming out! When the shower ran a smell of sewage came wafting out of the drain.The hotel is also located to far from the main shopping, as walking in 30 degree heat that far to get to shops was not an option.The Spa however was AMAZING, very very good service and treatments. One of the best I have ever been to. The breakfast buffet was also good.The pools however where very unattractive which sounds silly but much cheaper hotels have nicer pools!!. On a whole I would NEVER stay there again, the hotel was set out like a rabbit warren, the rooms are terribly run down and it was to far out of Kuta's main shopping.

<Content>Little piece of Paradise We stayed at the Alam Kulkul following a recomendation from friends who had stayed there before and we were not disappointed.Beautiful boutique resort hotel, friendly and helpful staff for whom nothing was too much trouble.We stayed here at the beginning of our trip and at the end, taking an Alam Villa for 4 nights at the start of the stay and the Java Villa for 4 nights at the end - the Java villa is simply stunning and well worth the extra $100 a night. A private plunge pool with loungers that got the sun for most of the day, with a very welcome chilled bottle of rose and fruit and cheese platter upon arrival.The main pools are very nice, although there was some major building work to the side of the hotel, a huge complex, which operated throughout the day and night, but didn't really affect us. The Spa was being renovated whilst we were there, but had been relocated elsewhere in the resort and we wouldn't really have known unless we had read it somewhere. The spa however is VERY expensive compared to elsewhere in Bali - a basic 1hr massage was $45 compared to about $5 for the same treatment elsewhere. It was good though.The restaurant served excellent food, and the bar served very good cocktails whilst the sun went down over the beach in the evenings. Papa's restaurant at the front of the hotel is renowned for pizza and pasta, and again the service and food was excellent.I'm sure you could find cheaper hotels from the bigger chains, but this attention to detail, service and design was just perfect for us, and we would not hesitate to recommend it 100%.If you need transportation whilst in Bali, our driver Wijana comes highly recommended - he took us all around the island, was very trustworthy, gentle and knowledgable. He can be booked in advance via his website [--] or [--].

<Content>A perfect Balinese Gem My husband and I stayed here for 3 days as we wanted to be nearer the markets before we headed off to Nusa Dua. The AlamKulKul is a great boutique hotel, friendly staff and great architechture. The hotel has little touches from wonderful stone figurines to a hidden spa. While it can't compete with the bigger hotels, it does offer a more relaxing and personal experience. Loads of families (small kids) where there which gave it a different feel from other more grown up resorts.

<Content>Tropical Oasis One word: WOW. What a beautiful property. It was an oasis in the crazy city of Kuta. The place was immaculately clean. The rooms were simply decorated in a tropical style with crisp and clean white bedding. They were big and had a lanai. My room overlooked the small side pool. I checked out Kuta Beach for a day of sun tanning. After being hassled by sellers and buying crap just to get them to leave me alone, I spent subsequent days by the hotel pool. What I found funny was that there were no in-room safes. They have this cute little room that holds the safety deposit boxes. You ring the bell to get in, retrieve items from your box, and sign for them. Many people might find this inconvenient. For me, it was rather charming.The breakfast buffet was huge. Of course, I overdosed on papayas. There were strange choices - like soup and other food you would encounter at lunch or dinner. A friend later explained that it was an Asian style breakfast. You will not leave hungry.The service was amazing. Unfortunately, I had to cut my stay short by a day to meet my partner in Singapore. The travel agent onsite changed my flight that morning to leave at noon. I didn't know if it would be possible, but she made it happen quickly and efficiently. This place was a little piece of heaven on earth. Although I wasn't that fond of Bali (save for the volcano), I wish I had the option to choose this boutique resort in every city.

<Content>Really enjoyed it! Stayed here for only 2 nights. Though it was a short stay, the ambiance of Alam Kulkul really puts me into the mood of a total relaxing vacation. Staff here were really friendly and went all the way to help me when I wanted flowers to propose to my then gf (now fiancee). They do not carry fresh flowers in the hotel and had to purchase it somewhere else and have it delivered to the hotel at no additional costs!The location is quiet and near to the beach, the cafe located up front is quite nice for a romantic dinner. Rooms were excellent as well.

<Content>average room ,great service Stayed here for 13 nights and this seemed to be the only place in Bali that did not serve eggs or chicken due to a bird flu scare!!!! How I wished for an omelette at breakfast.No complaints at all about service all staff were very friendly and helpful. Room service was excellent and free ice from room service a real bonus.Although the room was an O.K standard the bathroom was definately well worn. The tiles were cracked and the toilet seat had a cigarette burn ! For the price we paid I have no complaints but this is at best a good 3* resort. As it is located on a one way system we found it quicker to walk into Kuta and home at night.

<Author>coincidence
<Content>This is not Bali Having great faith in Tripadvisor, I booked this hotel in an instant, for our last 3 days in Bali, as it was rated number 1, of all the hotels here on tripadvisor, in Kuta Bali.Also, after checking their web site, I decided it looked very nice also, so went ahead and booked.Arriving at the hotel after already being in and around Bali for 11 days, we had somewhat of an idea, of how Bali hotels are, and I can say, that anyone staying in this hotel, is not experiencing Bali.The rooms (if you don't happen to be staying in an expensive villa (as seen on their web site)) are no better than standard 'hilton' quality. The building housing these rooms, is something like a hospital building. The grounds, were small and few plants, the pools were fine, but the main pool was like a sports swimming pool and very unattractive.Overall the feeling was something like a pretend Bali experience, from the constantly piped music which sounded like from a lift, to the bad location (yes, it is ON the beach, but as with most hotels in Kuta, is separated by a main road, and the is not hotel bar of even chairs for hotel use)The breakfast, standard hotel buffet, was offering choice, but not a lot of taste or quality.If you like hotels with no personality, that are overpriced and bland, you will love this place, but why stay in such a place in Bali, which is about culture, nature, beautiful gardens and personal service. Here I felt afraid to touch anything, as there were warnings everywhere that breakages must be paid for (complete with a full price list of every item in the room).In the end, we checked out after one night (even though we should stay 3) to go somewhere more personal. And this incurred a one night's charge for cancellation (who makes these hotel rules?)I think the term 'Boutique' is here stretched to the limits of its definition.Bland. And frankly, very disappointing.

<Content>Loved Alam Kulkul We stayed our last night in Bali at Alam Kulkul, as soon as we entered the room, we liked it, even though our room was on the very last corner , but the atmosphere inside was homey, it was not modernly designed or looked new, but very comfortable. I think it was because the room was bright. We also tried their Jamu Spa treatment : Hot Stone massage and Warm tea leaves Facial which was divine. We definitely will come back to Alam Kulkul in our next trip to Bali, and that time we would like to try their villa, which we're sure that is well groomed too, just like their hotel room.We highly recommend alam kulkul to everyone.

<Content>The feel of luxury and style. Our stay was one of the most pleasurable experiences. Having never been to Bali, i still felt very comfortable here. The staff would go out there way to make any thing we needed happen and the rooms were so clean and stylish it was a constant sense of luxury. The resort itself is located close to all of your shopping and entertainment needs, and if your were looking for some fanatastic meals, the resort itself has a fanastic variety of food. Anyone travelling to Bali should definintly stay here and you won't be dissappointed.

<Content>Experience at AlamKulkul I booked your hotel thru you hotel website. I had many choices eg Sheraton and Ayodhaya .( US $100-150). However, I kept going back to your site because it looked very traditional and nature friendly and looked very Balinese.I am here on a 5 day vacation with my 70 year old mother. I know that I will not be able to do too many activites - so I needed a hotel that had a gym and jacuzzi . However yours does not have but I still went ahead and booked your hotel because it had a very friendly and warm look and that is what I wanted to experience. Your staff is A+++++. They are very helpful and immediately respond to all my needs. I made my reservation with your reservation rep Vendi and he responded promptly to all my emails. He even came to meet me when I checked in and all my vouchers were ready and checking in was a breeze.Room is nice and clean except maybe they can make it a bit more brighter and livelier inside. - I know it is hard to blend traditional Balinese architecture with modern amentities and look.I love the architecture of the hotel - very nature friendly and full of trees and tropical plants.The restaurant service is great and they accomodated us very well with our request for vegetarian food.The one thing that needs to be improved is that pathways leading to the room. They should be better paved and well lit. We got lost on the first night trying to find our room in the rain and dark. I know that AlamKulful is trying to maintain it's rustic look but I think they need to balance for the convenience of senior citizens.I had a very pleasant stay here. I have many choices but I do not mind coming here again - just to enjoy the hospitality and eco friendly nature of this hotel.Thank you Alankulkul.Mala VoraDiamond Bar California USA

<Content>Over-rated and Over-priced OK, I guess I can actually say two positives about this place. The food is pretty good - - both breakfast and dinner were pretty good. Also, the location is pretty good - - it is on the Northern side of the busy beach - - around the hotel is quite quiet, but a quick walk down to the mayhem at the main part of the beach. But, in terms of positive things to say, that鈥檚 about it. The first room they put us in was at the very back 鈥揳bsolutely no view, mosquito-infested, and worn, run-down, and dirty. I had written about 20-30 specific things wrong with the room because I was so angry that one travel guide recommends this place as a top-end hotel (I will spare you鈥檃ll the list). After one night in this hell-hole of a room, I complained to management and they did shift us to a slightly better room - - though at best a 3-star room. It was roomy but odd - - obviously designed for families or big group to have some sleep behind a strange curtain in the room. It definitely was not stylish or pleasant to be in 鈥?very unimpressive and Spartan in the worst sense of the word. The setting of the hotel also is unimpressive - - it is mainly sidewalks going back to more and more rooms. The pool also looked unimpressive. Believe me you can get so much more for your money in Bali.

<Content>This is a great Legian Boutique hotel. The equal of the Padma We are experienced travellers to Bali and have been there six times. We rank this hotel higher than the Bali Padma at Legian which is also a beautiful hotel and we stayed at the Padma twice as well. The Kul Kul is a smaller boutique style hotel. Staff are very very good, and the hotel recently won an award for its service . It is directly opposite the Beach.Surf the web for a direct link to the resort which shows rooms and layouts. Kuta can be frenetic so what is the balance? Legian gives you quick access and is just far enough away to have some peace and quiet.We have stayed at the Alam twice and intend to stay there again next year. Why you may ask...This hotel is located at the end of the main beach road along the Melasti Street end of Legian and a 10 minute walk to Kuta Square. We like it because it is away from the noise and hassles of the Tuban end of Kuta but is still within walking distance. Kuta to Legian is one continuous shopping strip now and there are great bargains to be had nearby as well as the Legian beach market.Rooms are well laid out in a Balinese style and the villas are a nice indulgence. There are a wide selection of room The hotel foyer is welcoming surrounded amazing water features and koi fish ponds. The Villas are in front and there are two three storey accomodation blocks surrounding back pool. (there is a large pool at the front as well). Family rooms are available as well.Make sure you get the breakfast included in your booking as the food is excellent and the restaurant overlooks the Ocean. Nothing beats the view in the morning .Adjacent to the hotel is also an famous Cafe called Papa's which serves Italian and all sorts of Indonesian food and drinks. It is very popular, and reasonably priced and is a great place to watch the sunset over the water.PS Rooms do not have Ocean views they are set back from the street and overlook one of the two pools. But there is no road noise. Besides it is only 30 feet to the beach from the front door anywayThis is a private style resort which has a great feel about it. I highly recommend it to you. Oh, the hotel has one of the best Spa's available with a full range of treatments.
