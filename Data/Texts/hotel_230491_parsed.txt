<Content>Great little hotel My wife and I are just back from a pre-Christmas trip to Paris, staying at the Henri IV.The hotel is a really lovely boutique style hotel with a nice reception area and a cool little spiral staircase up to the bedrooms. Our room was really nice, very tastefully decorated with period features e.g. elaborate cornicing on the ceiling. Before the trip I had read that Parisian hotel rooms tend to be very small, but our (standard) room was a lot bigger than I expected. All the staff that we dealt with were very polite and professional. The hotel was very quiet - I don't think we saw another guest until the day we were leaving.The hotel was in an excellent location in the Latin Quarter, very close to the Metro with countless restaurants, brasseries and shops within walking distance. There is a nice little art-house cinema around the corner which was showing a season of old Cary Grant movies - we went to see I was a Male War Bride one night which was good fun.The hotel made an excellent base for sightseeing etc - the Metro is very easy to use and we were able to get around the sights very easily.So all in all an excellent hotel which I would highly recommend to anyone going on a break to Paris.

<Content>Great stay at Henri 4 I stayed at Hotel Residence Henri 4 last weekend with one of my friends. We had a great time. The hotel was clean and the room was a nice size. The concierge was very helpful and answered all of our questions. We booked our own shuttle to and from the hotel, but the concierge said they can book the shuttle for you. In hindsight we probably would have gone that route. The hotel is located about 2 blocks from a metro station and is in a great neighborhood. You can easily walk to the Pantheon and Notre Dame. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend the hotel. I will stay there again next time I'm in Paris!!

<Content>Charming Paris Hotel I have stayed in Henri IV before and remembered it to be a lovely, small hotel in an excellent location. My husband and I stayed only one night, as we were only passing through Paris on our way to India in early December. I called the hotel directly to reserve and was offered a room that was better than any we had stayed in the past, with a nice discount: Room 42, the Henri IV. It is a two room suite, decorated in lovely blues, with a canopied bed and marble fireplaces (non working obviously) in both rooms. There is a fridge and hotplate separate area and a large marble bathroom with a tub. It was very comfortable, quiet, and I find it particularly nice to have a second room in case one person wishes to sleep or read or vice versa when the other does not. The staff is very attentive. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Paris.

<Content>Lovely room Altough we were with three persons, we only got bathroom supplies for two persons. Both evenings we had to go to the reception to ask for towels. We did only get the shampoo, although the hotel had supplies like bath salt, something for your shoes, shower bonnet etc.. A pitty we didn't get this.In the kitchen there was only one pan, so you can make your breakfast, but not a real meal.The room was really nice and beautiful. Even the china fits with the curtains.Location of the hotel is excellent.The staff at the reception was nice.We would stay here again

<Content>Ideal! This small hotel was well placed with easy access to the Metro. Our (two) rooms were comfortable and spacious with comfy beds and hot showers. There are lots of very French cafes locally for breakfast and it is a five minute walk to Notre Dame and the Seine. Staff were proficient and understated but very friendly and appreciated our attempts to speak in French and make arrangements that were off the beaten track. The linen was clean and the pillowcases changed regularly during our five nights. The in-hotel breakfast experience was basic, but fine on the day we set off early for a trip to Versailles; otherwise we preferred to visit different cafes for breakfast. The little kitchenette was fine for making drinks, but with Parisian restaurants to explore we never made food in the suites. Our feeling is that we would happily stay there again. The Pantheon is nearby too and from the steps of the Pantheon there is a good view of La Tour Eiffel. The Cafe Marly attached to the Louvre is a lovely (though expensive) treat for a meal - important to reserve. (Check in advance the closing days of museums.) Gallerie Lafayette is a very pretty shopping experience. One of our highlights was an opulent treat at the Paris Opera - and astonishingly extravagant building and a memorable evening watching the premiere of a ballet.

<Content>Excellent location beautiful hotel We took a long weekend break with our teenage children from London in the UK, and booked Hotel Residence Henri IV mainly because of the very very positive trip advisor reviews. They were not wrong! The location is fantastic, walking distance down to the river and Notre Damme, over to the Louvre, and we especially loved the Latin Quarter at night for restaurants and for fabulous croissants and coffee for breakfast. Metro stations are abundant and we zipped around very easily. We had a first floor suite with a tiny but functional kitchenette where we could make tea and store soft drinks, beer and ice-cream (we were travelleing with teenagers). Beware the mini-bar Coke cans if you turn the fridge up to keep your beer cold though. One exploded on us causing mayhem! Staff shrugged it off when we explained and didn't expect payment. The furnishings and decor in the rooms and the lobby were lovely, quite posh in fact, front office staff very friendly and helpful and the cul-de-sac location made it quiet even though we were at the front of the hotel. I'd really recommend this as a base to explore and enjoy Paris and definitely use again.

The kitchenette was useful although it would have been good to have had some small supplies of tea and coffee on arrival. A small thing, it wouldn't at all stop us returning.

<Content>Terrific hotel A great find! We were motivated by previous reviewers, and the hotel lived up to their accolades. The room was snug, but with big windows, which made it feel more spacious. The location was perfect -- just a few blocks to Notre Dame, close to many wonderful little bistros, and convenient to both bus and Metro. But best of all, it is a neighborhood filled with real Parisans! Not tourists! We were most grateful to the superlative staff, who advised and guided us throughout our stay.

<Content>Three Star Gem The hotel ideally situated e.g., close to the Seine, Notre Dame, and walking distance to many other locations, e.g., D'Orsay, Louvre. The Metro is nearby, as are small excellent bistros and cafes. A great wine shop is around the corner. Two days a week a nearby plaza has a little outdoor market with great choices for gifts and picnics. The rooms are nicely furnished with updated bathroom fixtures and small kitchenette features (we want our Eric Kayser chocolates we left in the refrigerator!). The breakfast is OK but very convenient. Nights are very quiet even with the Blvd St. Germain close by. Staff are very helpful and patient. Their advice for transportation was always right on (For our Sunday afternoon arrival from CDG take a cab instead of a shuttle - cheaper for two and quicker; for the return in the early AM use a shuttle booked by the hotel. To Gare Lyon the hotel booked a cab). Everyone was very friendly, congenial, with lots of time for help and conversation. All are competent with English if one's French is rusty. Within the three-star class this hotel is an excellent choice. We'll go back next year.

<Content>A brilliant little boutique hotel I discovered this establishment on Trip Advisor and was delighted with my five night stay.It is a small hotel with just 13 rooms, located in a quiet street but only a short walk from the Notre Dame. The St Michel metro station is about 12 minutes walk away. There are lots of small shops, bistros and restaurants nearby, and each room has a small kitchen facility with hot plate, fridge and micro wave oven.The standard of housekeeping is excellent and the rooms are of a reasonable size and are well furnished. The bathroom is also a good size.The reception staff speak good English and are most helpful. I needed the services of a doctor and the person on duty made all the arrangements on my behalf. I give the Henry IV top marks and my personal recommendation.

<Content>No complaints here..... Another one who booked this hotel from the Tripadvisor reviews and it did not disappoint. We spent 3 nights here over the last weekend in July, my husbands 40th birthday.It took about 10 mins to walk from the Metro and on arrival we were allocated Room 1 which was on the ground floor next to reception. Room was beautifully furnished and we were very pleased to find a small kitchenette at one end of the room which we were not expecting. This became invaluable as each morning we purchased a fresh french stick from the local bakery (2 mins walk) and made ourselves up a packed lunch for our days out sightseeing! We also kept our wine in there!As previously mentioned, Notre Dame and the Seine for river cruises are within easy walking distance (5 mins) but we also discovered the number 53 bus which took us from outside the hotel (literally 20 paces away) to the Eiffel Tower - result! We also used it to get across to the Trocadero as on my hubs birthday we ate at Cafe de L'Homme as a special treat. If you get a chance then go - the view of the Eiffel Tower is awesome and it looks beautiful lit up at night.Despite being on the ground floor/by the reception desk - noise was not an issue at all - in fact I don't think we saw another guest throughout our stay even though the hotel was full!My only slight negative was due to us being there during probably the hottest weekend in Europe this summer! No air-con just a small cooling tower which we had to keep on all night and it was still stifling. No windows in the bathroom just a rooflight so you could only spend a few mins in there at a time - not great when you are trying to do your make-up!We didn't bother with breakfast so can't comment on that but overall, a fab little hotel - lovely and peaceful and a great price. Recommended.

Well worth the visit and we would always try and stay there in future visits to Paris.

<Content>Good Hotel But Not Exceptional A great hotel but lets keep it in perspective.We spent 4 nights at this hotel in a standard room and returned for 1 night in a suite. We were very happy with the hotel but a couple of things need to be understood. Firstly the hotel is nothing like the image created by the small mood pics on the hotel website. The rooms are very standard for a hotel of this size and era in Paris and are not as well lit or fitted with the quality decor the pictures suggest. Nor do I consider it the Gem or delight that many reviews state. Having said that I have no complaints to make regarding our stay. The room was comfortable, reasonably well appointed, and, for Paris, of a reasonable size. In fact we enjoyed our standard room more than the suite, especially when one considers the additional cost of a suite. The hotel is located in a cul de sac and is quiet. While Notre Dame is in walking distance and several great restaurants are nearby (refer to hotel front desk for recommendations) it is nevertheless a little bit on the fringe of the shopping and areas of nearby interest. There are two metro stops in good proximity to the hotel. It is a good choice and option to stay at and I would recommend it but dont have expectations in excess of the reality based on the reviews

<Content>Great place, walking distance to sights My husband and I just returned from an 8 night stay at the Residence Henri IV and were very pleased with this hotel. The rooms are a nice size (for Europe) with comfortable beds and the bathrooms and showers were very nice (except for the hairdryer, but really, who cares) with good hot water and water pressure. They have a laptop that you can use to check email for free. The location is excellent... close walking distance to lots of cafes along Blvd St Germain, as well as the Seine and Notre Dame, and if you like to walk, the Louvre, and Musee d'Orsay and even all the way to the Champs Elysees and the Eiffel Tower (which we did). Plenty of good boulangeries closeby for breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful in arranging a shuttle to take us to and from the airport, which was cheaper than a cab and easier than dealing with luggage on public tranportation. I would definitely recommend Residence Henri IV.

<Content>Lovely little Paris hotel I booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews, and was not disappointed. We stayed for three days after our tour of some of the most average hotels in Italy and Spain, and our standard room seemed like a palace. It was decorated in red and white, with a tiny Juliet balcony, big swag curtains and fresh carpet and linen. There was another huge window in the beautifully tiled and generous bathroom.I loved having a fridge, if we had stayed longer and the weather had been better we would have stocked the fridge and picnicked in the gardens. I can't comment on the breakfast. I did wish we had a kettle, but tea and coffee making facilities seem rare in European hotels.The staff were all pleasant and helpful and the hotel is in a good location, very quiet as others have stated, but near lots of cafes and delis, and well located for the tourist icons if you have only a few days as we did. I will definitely book this hotel again for our next trip to Paris.

<Content>Hassle-free We spent a lot of time looking for hotels and as we'd left it until the last minute found most places were booked. In desperation we rang around a number of hotels and found the reception staff at the Residence Henri IV extremely friendly and helpful. We were concerend that the rooms in Paris - and the beds - might be small so they fitted us with two twins (basically a double bed with two mattresses) which were perfect. The check in and check out were completely hassle-free - took literally two minutes; and no complications. While the rooms might be a little tired they have character and importantly are clean, airy and a very good size, not just for Paris standars but for anywhere. The bathroom was similarly spacious and unlike most hotels actually had a window. We were extremely pleased with the location of the hotel and the service we received there and would have no hesitation in recommending it to others. We didn't try the breakfast as there were basic kitchen facilities in the room and plenty of cafes nearby.

<Content>The good reviews I read of the Henri IV proved true The Henri IV is a tiny hotel (about a dozen rooms), but the rooms are reasonably-sized (by Paris standards). Ours included a mini kitchen (fridge, stove, sink  microwave) and a full-sized bath. We paid about 190 Euros per night, which didn't seem that unreasonable (again by Paris standards).The Hotel doesn't have a lot in the way of public amenities: breakfast in the basement was noisy and a bit depressing; a single copy of the Herald Tribune was available in the small lobby. But for us a big plus was that the hotel is on a quiet cul-de-sac just off the Rue des Ecoles, which meant that you could easily find interesting restaurants, bus and metro connections around the corner, but you weren't bothered by traffic noise at night.In general, I found that the on-line reviews by other guests, which I had read before I made the booking, were on the mark. I would stay there again.

Very clean friendly hotel, larger than average sized room and the kitchen area a great bonus. Excellent location and all the staff, bar none, were friendly and helpful. I had to email specifying floor preference as I do not like elevators and they replied immedately saying they would be delighted to accommodate my request and gave us room on specified floor. Staff happy to phone taxis etc for us and write down in French any info we had to pass over eg destination etc. A great experience and will definately return to the same hotel any time in Paris.

<Content>OK Hotel, Booking it was a problem I had booked a superior room online, which was immediately charged to my card. A few days later I had to call them to change the dates, due to unavoidable charter flight changes.I understood that if I were to cancel, I would lose the money, however I explained that I didn't want to cancel my reservation, I simply wanted to change the dates. At first they refused, and said they'd keep 100% of the money, and I'd be forced to pay for other nights, or go somewhere else.After much arguing, I was able to change the dates, and they allowed us by exception to stay in a standard room, but at the SUPERIOR rate.During the process, they basically accused me of making my story up, citing that people have made up stories of their pets dieing, etc. in order to cancel reservations.Again, I didn't want to cancel, just change dates.Once there, the hotel was fine, our room was tiny (to be expected, but that's why I had originally booked a superior)... however I'm surprised (or perhaps not) by the arrogance and entitlement of the people I had to deal with in order to make changes to our reservation.If my card hadn't already been charged, there's no way I would have given them my business.

We got a great deal by booking directly with the hotel via their website. I would recommend renting bikes from the bike shop across from Notre Dame. We were able to tour around Paris with ease as there are safe bikelanes almost everywhere. The Mexican restaurant down the street, and the bakery Eric Kaiser on Rue Ecole were especially good.

The staff were great, even prior to getting there they answered all my questions promptly via email. We got there super early and they were nice enough to let us check-in earlier when there was a room available.

<Content>Great hotel I loved this hotel! We stayed in four hotels throughout France, and this one was my favorite. The room was very quaint and French with wonderful windows and decorations. The hotel is on a dead-end street, which makes it quieter than other hotels, and the location in the Latin Quarter is perfect. It's close to a Metro stop and to the Ile de France (Notre Dame and Ste. Chappelle).I didn't realize how much I should have appreciated the bathroom until we experienced other hotels in France. Henri IV has a full tub and a shower head that is actually located above your head, not at your knees (this is a big problem in France). It was the most American bathroom of all the hotels I stayed in.The staff is also very friendly and helpful, and they all speak English.All in all, I really enjoyed Henri IV and would stay there again.

Large room with the usual huge bed and a chaise lounge (we were in Paris after all). A very clean and well equpped bathroom which was lit by a skylight which is such a help in the middle to the night when it is pitch black and you need to find the loo. The staff were very friendly and helpful.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Elegant French Hotel We have just returned from a Europe vacation and my best memories are of our time spent in Paris where we stayed at the Hotel Residence Henri IV.We had a lovely room with elegant French decoration,gorgeous French doors leading onto a small balcony with black wrought iron table and chair and a terracotta flower box filled with red geraniums- oh so Parisian! We were on the 6th floor so had a view over the rooftops when we had breakfast. The room also had a kichenette which was an added bonus.We were near the St Nicholas du Chardonet Church so we woke on Sunday to the beautiful sound of the church bells. We found the size of the room a pleasant surprise after London especially the bathroom.It is situated in the Latin Quarter and is close to shops, 2 small supermarkets,boulongeries, restaurants, Notre Dame, Jardin du Luxembourg- a beautiful park and of course the Seine River. We walked to the Lourve from here but there is also the hop on hop off bus which leaves near Notre Dame and takes you to all the major attractions.

<Content>Good hotel Good hotel in the centre of Paris, close to river and Notre Dame. Staff made us feel very welcome. We took our 2 small children, and had a small suite which was great for them to have a separate room but still be close to us.Good play park just along the road for children with slides and climbing frames.

<Content>Paris' Best! My wife and I have been visiting Paris frequently since 1998 and this is the single best hotel we've stayed in, bar none. While I have to agree with all of the other comments here about how wonderful the rooms are, the great location, the fantastic bakeries and wine shops in the area, what really sets this hotel apart is the professional, friendly staff. They go out of their way to ensure that not only are all your needs met, but that you are made to feel welcome in their hotel. I am a native English speaker, but get along quite well in French. One of the small things that I appreciate from the staff is that they continue to speak to me in French even after noting that my accent, rather than switching to English. I enjoy their willingness to help me perfect my French!We stayed on the top (6th) floor (yes, there is an elevator) in one of the standard rooms (not an apartment). It was plenty big enough, especially the bathroom. Tiny little balcony was cute, but really too small to make use of, at least for more than one person. There are only two rooms on the top floor, and the single negative thing I have to say about our stay was that the other folks on the floor had no concept of how loud they were!The kitchenette was nice, as it allowed us to keep bottled water, chill some wine, and a few snacks. It's not really robust enough to create a big meal, but who wants to eat in their hotel room in Paris anyway?Lastly, do not be put off by the rate listed here on TripAdvisor or on the hotel website. We were able to get a really good rate by booking through Expedia.We will definitely be making this hotel our go-to choice when visiting Paris in the future.

<Content>Le weekend a Paris This was our second visit to the Hotel Residence Henri IV and was even more enjoyable than our first, since visiting in summer meant we could get full benefit from our beflowered balcony. This is absolutely the best place to stay in Paris since it's effectively a small, beautiful apartment. All the rooms are decorated and furnished in the most exquisite taste, unlike most hotels, and the staff are as charming as the rooms.One of the best aspects of the accommodation is the little kitchenette (fridge, two electric hotplates, microwave, small sink plus very basic cutlery, china, glass) which means that, for example, before a long afternoon/ evening visit to Versailles a small lunch can be prepared and eaten with a snacky supper taken late at night on returning.The hotel is situated in our favourite part of Paris with a plenitude of shops, cafes, restaurants and metro stations and most places of interest within walking distance.The only drawback to Hotel Residence Henri IV is that it is so comfortable there is a temptation to loll about reading, chatting and sipping wine without venturing out to seek other Parisian delights.

<Content>Charming small hotel, great location This was a charming hotel with more than enough space for 2 adults and 2 teenagers for a short stay. The rooms were very clean. We had a tiny kitchen but no kettle or cafetiere, and not enough crockery for 4. To be fair we didn't ask for any more, if we had have done I'm sure it would have been forthcoming as the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. Expensive, but it's the middle of Paris, a two minute walk from Notre-Dame, and the exchange rate was poor for us.

<Content>Charming hotel in the Latin Quarter This is a really quaint hotel in the Latin Quarter - a sensational part of Paris to stay in. Honestly, we really can't fault this place. It's in a quiet yet central location, within decent walking distance of both Maubert and Cardinal Lemoine metros, and near to heaps of good cafes in the Latin Quarter. The room was really quite spacious (for Paris), and so too was the bathroom. Being a residence hotel, we had a kitchenette, which was very handy for microwaving the odd quiche. The staff were really friendly and helpful with any questions. Finally, I'd say that I was most impressed with the great value for money here, it was easily the most affordable hotel we found in this great area. Can't comment on the breakfast as we unfortunately never got around to having it there with the choice of cafes nearby.

<Content>Quaint, cosy and lovely This is a perfect hotel/apartment located in the heart of St Germaine. The one bedroom apartment is ideal for a family who need a small (but serviceable) kitchen to warm up bottles or food for a toddler or baby. The rooms are spacious by Paris standards and it has a bath (which is rare by Paris standards). As expected the lifts are tiny but overall the hotel is kept in excellent condition and rooms are comfortable. Highly recommended for a family.

<Content>Fabulously Quaint Hotel in Wonderful Location!!! This is a beautiful and traditional property with flower boxes outside the large windows that lead to small wrought iron balconies where you can enjoy the charm of Paris. The neighborhood is quiet, yet very Parisian with specialty stores and coffee shops. We found a grocery store, fruit stand, liquor store and patisserie right behind the hotel. The hotel has six floors and a cirular stair case that is absolutely charming (don''t panic--they also have a small elevator). Our room on the 6th floor was a little more casual and slightly smaller than some of the others (which are very large rooms)--very french country in the decor with a full bath, microwave, rerigerator, sink, etc. The bed was a little smaller also, but it was still fine for us. The staff was very helpful and we had a great time!!! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone! Very close to Notre Dame, the Seine and the Latin Qtr. It's terrific!!!!

<Content>convenient and quiet This is a wonderful, small (13-room) and nicely furnished three-star hotel on a quiet deadend street near the Metro Maubert-Mutualite stop in the Latin Quarter. We spent five nights in an apartment accompanied by a granddaughter. The apartment consisted of two BR, an ample bathroom and a small kitchen. The staff is very helpful and pleasant, the rooms supplied with fresh linens and cleaned daily, and the price is reasonable. We stayed here in 2004 also. Close by is the exceptional Keyser boulangerie, our first morning stop to gather baguettes, brioches and croissants to take home for breakfast.

<Content>Magnificant stay in Paris My husband, I and two children (11 and 17) stayed in the Hotel Henri for two nights. What a gem this hotel is in Paris. The rooms are spacious and very clean. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as the children are very fussy eaters. We bought goodies from a supermarket within walking distance of the hotel and made use of the self-catering equipment in the room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definately stay there again in future.

<Content>perfect. This hotel is perfect for a stay in Paris. So perfect that I am hesitant to write a review, as it might become too popular. Without a doubt we will be staying here on any future visit to Paris.The room was comfortable and nicely furnished. The large floor to ceiling windows in both the bedroom and bathroom meant we could get a nice breeze through the room. Very little noise, considering it is in a city.It has a small, personal feel about it. The reception and entrance hall is small, which was rather nice and gave a personal feel. We never even saw any of the other guests around.It is ideally located if you are looking to explore Paris either on foot or by Metro (500 metres away). Notre Damme is a five minute walk. For evening eating we would suggest finding one of the many simple restaurants in the St Germain area, which is about 10 minutes walk away.We'll be back.

<Content>Ideal location, charming hotel I stayed in this hotel with my husband and mother-in-law for 4 nights in mid-March. My mother-in-law was visiting from the US, and as this stay in Paris was her first introduction to Europe, we wanted to ensure that our hotel was well-located in relation to most of the major sites. My husband and I have stayed in Paris several times, and this location was by far the best that we've stayed in. It is a comfortable walk (approximately 10 minutes) from Notre Dame. The train from CDG airport also drops you about a 15 minute walk from the hotel--very convenient. Furthermore, as other reviewers have noted, the hotel is located at the end of a small street, meaning that the location is quiet in the evening--a plus when sleeping.The rooms themselves were relatively large by Paris standards, meaning still small, but comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly, and when we arrived significantly before checkin, it was not a problem to store our bags for an hour while they quickly prepared our room.We ate breakfast in the hotel one morning, but weren't terribly impressed. As another reviewer has noted, the breakfast room is in the basement.All in all, the hotel was an excellent find in an ideal Latin Quarter location, and the next time we travel to Paris, we will definitely stay again.

<Content>Keeping the Residence Henri IV a secret! We booked the Residence Henri IV on booking.com after researching on TripAdvisor. Can't say enough about how much we LOVE this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful with directions and suggestions at anytime of the day or night. The room was larger than your standard Paris room...we weren't hurdling over our baggage to get from the bathroom to the bed. With a 5 minute walk to Notre Dame/Ile St. Louis from the hotel, the location couldn't be any better. With the hotel being at the end of a dead end off of Rue Ecole, traffic noise is very low (big plus after exploring Paris all day). We booked our first night on booking.com for 154 euro (June 30). We then decided to book a additional night and contacted the hotel to see if a room was still available. The staff got back with me the same day and gave us the same room at the same rate. Can't beat good service!Would love to keep this one to ourselves but we have to share with everyone.... this is a real find in Paris!

<Content>Terrific Little Hotel! I have been meaning to write this review forever. My husband and I stayed at the Residence Henri for four nights during New Year's week. I can't say enough about the hotel or the charming staff. We had a room on the first floor with no balcony. However, it was very clean, spacious with a nice little kitchenette. Nice bathroom toiletries as well. Our one complaint (and this is about most European hotel beds) is that the mattress on our bed was not very comfortable. Just way too firm for our liking. That aside, the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. Our day manager during our stay was a young man from Morrocco who was studying at the Sorbonne. His English was fantastic and he was very good natured about my terrible French (which I insisted on practicing to my husband's chagrin) My husband took ill one day, and he was very helpful in directing me on where to get medicine and even recommended warm Coca Cola for DH's stomach (it does work wonders by the way).I underscore other review's comments about the location - it's perfect for getting around Paris. Not only are you in the heart of the Latin Quarter, a stone's throw from Notre Dame (go very early if you don't want to wait in line for hours to get in!), but there are many wonderful restaurants within walking distance. Make sure to go to the Erik Kaiser pattisierie in the morning to get some of the best French pastery you will ever eat! Overall terrific hotel and a great value in one of Paris' best neighborhoods. I'll be returning for my next trip.

<Content>Highly Recommend The Hotel Residence Henri IV is in a great part of town and very convenient to many of the popular tourist attractions. The hotel is at the end of dead end street which makes the immiediate area a little more quiet and intimate. However, once you walk to the first intersection, you are in the heart of the Latin Quarter, surrounded by shops, restaurants, bakeries and cafes and just a few minute's walk from Notre Dame. A metro station is around a 10 minute walk from the hotel.The hotel's staf was friendly, helpful and pretty good with English.We had what was called an apartment for four people -- my wife and I plus our two daughters. The room had a bedroom with a queen size bed and a living roon with a pull-out sofa. The pull-out bed was small for two people (even if one of the two was my six-year-old daughter). The room also had a kitchenette which we did not use. The hotel and room were both older but very clean. The room was adequate for us. There were a couple of disappointing aspects to the room. The towels in the bathroom were threadbare and the toilet seat was worn (not dirty).The breakfast room was in the basement and not a particularly great place to start your day in Paris. The breakfast was OK. We ate there only one day when we were in a rush. We enjoyed our breakfasts at the local cafes much more.In summary -- very nice and friendly hotel in a great location. We would definitely stay here again.

It is also proximal to the on and off water taxi and the subway at Saint Michel which expands your range to most of the city.The staff was friendly and quite helpful. They appoached their duties with a high degree of professionlism which complimented the pleasure of our stay. They successfully handled several special requests for us and their follow up was excellentThe breakfast room is spare and a little drap but the food was a fairly good. Our guest room was adequate by European standards. It appeared that most of the rooms had a balcony which provide a pleasant place to sit. The street is a dead end which allows a quiet nights sleep.

<Content>Perfect Place in Paris The Hotel Residence Henri IV is a gem. We booked this hotel because it looked like we would feel like we were in Paris instead of some ultra modern hotel that we normally gravitate towards. Most of the other hotels we considered were in my opinion, way overdone with floral patterns on the bedspreads, curtains, walls and the carpet, so I was very happy to find this hotel which was tastefully decorated. We like to live how the locals live while we visit a new place, so keep that in mind when I tell you that the breakfast was good. There were croissants with jam and Nutella, cereal, fresh fruit, orange juice, coffee, tea and water which is typical for a French breakfast, so if you are expecting a traditional American breakfast, remember you are in France and probably won't find that at many places no matter how hard you try. It is located on a quiet street in the Latin Quarter with a metro station just 2 blocks away with a lot of restaurants and markets around. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and spoke very good English - I realized at a later point of our trip (in another hotel) how important friendly hotel staff is when you are in another country, especially where you don't speak the language fluently; they can make or ruin your experience. The room we booked was a standard room which was a good size for two people. There was a queen size bed, two small closets for hanging clothes, tv, a small table and desk and 2 chairs and a small kitchenette which we barely used except to make tea. The bathroom was fairly good sized and had a shower/bath, sink, toilet and a hairdryer. Not a lot of room to put toiletries, but we made it work. Overall, a great experience and I would go back to stay there in a heart beat.

<Content>Loved it!! Was perfect. We have a 10 month old baby and they were very accommodating. They gave us a room on the ground floor, so it was very easy with the pram. The room was a generous size - plenty of room for the double bed, wardrobe, day bed, port-a-cot which was provided free of change and was set up ready for our arrival, a small fridge / stove top, and a lovely bathroom with bath and shower over the bath. Very nice decor. We were able to use the sitting room near reception to read / have snacks while our baby napped in the room. The reception staff spoke good English and happily booked us a taxi to the airport, which arrived on time even though there was a metro strike at the time! The hotel is in a perfect location - less than a 5min direct walk to Notre Dame.

<Content>A beautiful little hotel in a great locaation We had a fantastic time at this delightful hotel in its fabulous location down a little cul-de-sac but right in the heart of the Left Bank. Although our taxi driver had a little difficulty finding it, and our room was not quite ready on arrival, the staff were very friendly, providing umbrellas, travel advice and directions. The decor in our apartment was not absolutely pristine (expecially the bathroom - so lovers of bland luxury need not apply), However, the architectural quality and atmosphere of the building, lovely linen, view over a little garden opposite and overall design more that made up for this. Our party of 4, including 2 children, didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel, but would certainly go back again and the little kitchenette would be a great bonus for snacks and lazy breakfasts. Chic and yet comfortable, central but quiet, historic but not antiquated, a great choice for central Paris sightseeing, for families or a romantic getaway.

<Content>Truly fit for a king! We have recently returned from a long weekend in Paris staying at the Hotel Residence Henri IV. Though more expensive than some of the hotels we looked at we liked the idea of basic self catering facilities and were encouraged by the previous reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed.The hotel is located in the Latin Quarter, a lively, cultured and serene part of the city surrounded by educational establishments, bookshops and cafes. The hotel was not the easiest to find but with a little help from a lovely French lady we made it.The first thing that struck us was how lovely the guy on Reception was. He spoke fluent English and was very charming and helpful. Our room was a reasonable size (for Paris) with a nice bathroom and small kitchenette (fridge, couple of hobs and a microwave). There were however limited plates and cutlery so it might be worth considering bringing some with you! The room was nicely decorated and immaculate.Paris is easily accessible via the Metro, of which there are a couple of stops nearby. It was lovely to return to this quiet, safe and friendly hotel after a long day out sightseeing/shopping.I really would recommend this hotel and we definitely plan to return.

<Content>Simple and Perfect, or Simply Perfect! With the dollar worth next to nothing, and Paris being an international city where decent hotels cost, well, you know, it was such a relief to find Residence Henri IV. First, it's quiet - at the end of little dead end street, and the windows are so good that they close out the sound of the pigeons in the morning. The shower is hot and strong; lacking only face cloths. The bed is kind to one's back and the linens are soft and fresh. Skip the in-house breakfast and enjoy the wonderful options within a few minutes walk - especially the local fresh market just down the street. This is not a luxury hotel; there's not even a radio or alarm clock in the rooms, but then, who goes to Paris to listen to the BBC or to wake up in the morning? This is a simple place, fun and in a wonderful neighborhood. The staff is cordial and speaks English almost as well as French. I'd stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Great Stay We stayed at the Henri IV Residence Hotel for two nights and were pleased with our stay. The bed was the most comfortable one we encountered on our trip (stayed at another hotel in Paris a few blocks away and in London). The bathroom was above average (great shower) and included nicer toiletries (including shower gel...rare find!). The bathroom had a window that could be opened to look out at the hotel courtyard (Room 20). Our room also had a little balcony that looked out over the entrance to the hotel, on a little dead end street. The kitchen was nothing to get excited about (it is the size of a US refrigerator) and we ignored it's existence. We never had breakfast, since for 10 euros, both my husband and I could a breakfast that better suited us (diet coke! pain au chocolate!). We stayed on the Blvd. St. Michel, about a 10 minute walk from the Henri IV Residence earlier and found this to be much quieter (you can sleep with your windows open). It was near metro stops, so it was very convenient. The hotel booked us a taxi to the airport, as the RER was on strike for one day, and it was seamless. The cost was 40 euros, plus a small tip. We had taken the RER (18 euros) in from the airport and thought it was worth it to taxi back (easier to find your correct terminal  make it on time).

<Content>A quiet place in a large city This hotel was better than expected. In the centre of the Latin Area there was access to restaurants, stores, metro and everything to meet your travel needs in Paris. Close walking distance to the main metro terminal St. Michels and to most Paris sites.This rare find hotel was at the end of a dead_end street where you heard no traffic noise. Check out the hotel black cat (noir chat).Rooms were large for Paris standards with kitchenettes. The elevator was a bit scarey but glad they had one. Rooms were clean. All rooms have a balcony except #1 - which is on the main floor behind reception. A large room but the window opens onto the parking lot. Not a problem with noise but nice to have balcony doors you can open on the other floors. We didn't try the continental breakfast for 8 euro as there are too many options with vendors outside the hotel.Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. They have a laptop for customer use. Laundry mat around the corner.

<Content>Could hardly bring ourselves to leave! This hotel was outstanding! Great location in the Latin Quarter, but near a park for some green space and quiet at night. Five minute walk to the Seine and Notre Dame. Close to two metro stops and open-air market, which was really fun. Anything you might need within a couple of blocks. Queen size bed and what I considered a really large room-space for hanging clothes, desk, a table. Plenty of room for our bags and all of the shopping we did, and we could still move around! The bathroom was also large and comfortable. I was afraid that Paris hotel rooms would be very tiny, so this was a very pleasant surprise.  The staff were amazing! So friendly and helpful in every possible way. They got us taxis, reservations for a boat trip on the Seine, laundry...whatever you need, they will get it for you. We never tried the hotel breakfast because there was a wonderful boulangerie right around the corner. But considering everything else about the hotel, I'm sure it was nice. Having a mini-fridge and kitchen facilities was great! You couldn't exactly prepare gourmet cuisine, but you could heat food and store food and drinks. We went to the market one morning and bought cheese, fruits, roasted chicken, bread, pate, and then had a real feast in our room that evening. The hotel even supplies wineglasses and a corkscrew, so get some wine too! We were thrilled with this hotel and would definitely stay there again. You can get a really good deal through the hotel website if you book early. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in this beautiful part of Paris.

<Content>Excellent small hotel in Latin Quarter It's hard to find a hotel in Paris that gives you a real feeling of being in a foreign country and still carries good amenities. That's the Residence Henri IV. It's located at the dead end of a street in the Latin Quarter, three blocks from a bridge that crosses the Seine near the back of Notre Dame Cathedral. The Metro stop is a five-minute walk, and there's bus service even closer. You'll hear church bells chiming from the two churches that are closer than Notre Dame, but not late at night. Even though there are college students down the street (the Sorbonne) it's very quiet. A small park is practically across the street. The hotel is six stories but only has 13 rooms. Some of the rooms are two-room suites, but my wife and I stayed eight nights in a standard room, 17 square meters, which is plenty of room for two twin size beds, an armoire with a door for each person, a large bathroom with a powerful hot shower, and the piece de resistance, a small fridge, stove top and kitchen sink. Thus, it's no problem to pass up the hotel's continental breakfast at 8 Euros per day per person and pick up some pastries and drinks the night before, or stash cold drinks at prices lower than the hotel minbar's. There are plenty of stores and patisseries around (the best is Eric Kayser's organic bakery on Boulevard St. Germain, two blocks away, which seems to draw the most locals). No AC, but we were there in May with daily temps in the 70s and we just opened the windows for great cross-ventilation. (We were on the third floor.) The hotel also provides a tower fan. The elevator is small and slow, but you might fall in love with the spiral staircase (as long as you're not up too high!). Room decor is a sort of country French. There's a small flat-screen TV but we never turned it on. You don't go to Paris to watch TV! Hotel staff speaks excellent English and is splendidly helpful. I thought the beds were a little hard but I like them softer than most people anyway. Cleanliness was excellent. Price is high (230 Euros a night for a standard room, about 50 percent more for a suite) but we got big savings by booking six months in advance through the hotel's own website.

<Content>Lives up to the hype We stayed at the Henri for 2 nights. The hotel is located in the 5eme and, therefore, very centrally located. It is situated on a quiet little side street, but the general area has several eating and shopping establishments. As for the hotel itself, it is quite nice. The lobby is small, but very well kept. The staff is very professional (we encountered 3 desk clerks during our stay) and most had ample English speaking skills. Hicham was on duty when we arrived (I told you that I would mention you, Hicham鈥? and had lots of information about the area and Paris in general. As for the room, our room was of average size (for Central Paris), I suppose. It was very clean, however. I do love a clean hotel room and ours did not disappoint. The bathroom was also very neat and tidy. Our room had two single beds, a desk, nightstand and large dresser. There were also two wardrobes/closets for clothing. A mini-fridge, cutlery, drinking utensils and hot stove were also in the room. This was a very nice touch since we brought food and wine back to the room. We paid 160E per night and this was a very good deal. I messed up our booking (on Booking.com), initially, and didn鈥檛 realize my error until a few weeks before arrival. By then, rooms were more scarce and the price had gone up. However, the hotel honored the price that was available at the time of my earlier booking, thereby saving us about 20E/night. Not a ton of money, but a very nice gesture on behalf of hotel management. All in all, this hotel lives up to its lofty reviews on TA. It represents great value for the money and the location is fabulous. Paris is a very walkable city and this hotel is in a great location and within 2 blocks of a metro line. Definitely recommended.

<Content>Anniversary at the Residence Henri IV We spent a week at the Henri IV for our 10th anniversary. The staff was courteous and spoke English. The room (#60, standard double on the top floor) was larger than we had anticipated, had air conditioning, a small balcony, and an updated bathroom. The hotel was very quiet, as it was a couple of blocks from the busy rue St. Germain. A few blocks from the hotel, on rue Monge, was a wonderful street market just in front of a series of shops selling pastries, cheese, wine, meats, and fruits and vegetables. Ile de la Cite and Notre Dame were only a 5 minute walk away. The weather was wonderful, so we also were able to walk many of the other sights in central Paris. We would definitely recommend a stay at the Henri IV.

<Content>Great little hotel We loved the Hotel Residence Henri IV. The rooms were extremely clean and well cared for, my biggest worry booking a hotel I had never seen. The staff, especially Isham, were so helpful. We did choose to have breakfast in the hotel and did not regret it. A typical European (continental) breakfast, very generous portions, coffee, milk, and juice. The Latin Quarter area where the hotel is located is fabulous for brasseries and boulangeries, plenty of places to eat and shop within walking distance or a couple of metro stops. Lovely ambience for evening walks. The metro is not as easily accesible as it could be, but for all the other benefits, I would definitely say the couple of blocks walk was worth it. We would definitely choose the Henri IV again!

<Content>Very Comfortable Hotel I booked the Hotel Residence Henri IV after much research using Tripadvisor, and a couple of other sites available on the internet. The room rates were reasonable, and not over priced for what you got. I travelled during the second week in April, just before the busy season.This research really paid off, as I and my partner were not disappointed with our spacious, clean and comfortable room. The room itself was large by European standards (one thing my research promised), nicely furnished with ample wardrobes and dressers for clothes, and a small area with a built-in bar fridge, sink and stove. Everything was spotless. Great housekeeping. The room was QUIET, the bed comfortable and the sheets were of good quality, so sleeping was easy. The hotel is removed a little off the street, so traffic noise is not problem.The marble tiled bathroom was newly renovated, with both a bath and a shower, great water pressure....and lots of hot water! I purchased the breakfasts, and it was a great way to get the day going. We were more than satisfied with the croissants, buns, and as much juice and good coffee that you wanted. There is a 24 hour concierge, which is great because you don't have to worry about when you get back to the hotel, and they keep the key, so you don't have to worry about losing it. Maps, directions, and friendly service were also appreciated. We used the shuttle service that the hotel offered to the airport on our way home, and it was much more economical than a taxi. Would I stay here again? Yes! As a matter of a fact, I am planning to return in the fall  will definitely book a room.The area surrounding the hotel is also filled with great affordable restaurants. Sites like the Pantheon and Notre Dame are just a 10 minute stroll. Nicely centred in the Latin district.A wonderful Paris hotel in this price range!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel for our Honeymoon We booked this hotel for our Honeymoon and were not disappointed. The staff were excellent, warm and friendly. We had a great room and found a small gift there on our arrival. The location of this hotel is perfect, just a few minutes walk from the metro and 10 minutes to the Seine and Notra Dame.The room was serviced daily and every night there were chocolates on the pillows, a nice touch!. Nothing was too much trouble, we asked to book a taxi for our depature and were given excellent money saving advice.We only took breakfast once, that was excellent and was offered either in the breakfast room, or our bedroom.The rates here are very reasonable and represent excellent value for money if you want a small friendly hotel. There is no bar or restaurant so if you want those this is not for you BUT you are in Paris and there are more restaurants, cafes and bars in easy reach than you could try even if you stayed a month.

The room was large and the bathroom was huge. The staff was friendly and helpful. We liked having the continental breakfast brought to our room. It was a leisurely way to start the day with no delivery fee. The only thing that was not perfect was the bed--it was hard. But I would not say that it would stop me from staying there again. It really is a charming hotel in a wonderful location. The area around it has a lot of shops, cafes and attractions.

<Content>Wonderful smalll hotel My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Residence Henri IV, in February 2008. It is a very nice, well located small hotel. We had early booking at their discounted rated so 3 nights were 549.00 euros, total. We had what is called a 鈥淪uperior Room鈥?which included a small living room, futon couch, with a small table and 2 chairs, a good size separate bedroom with nice TV, (we plugged in our IPOD and watched our US favorites). The photos shown on the web and the photos on Trip Advisor represented the hotel accurately. The small kitchenette with microwave was fine for snacks and their small refrigerator good for beverages and cheeses. The bathroom was clean and of good size, with a shower curtain. The rooms large windows open to a small step-out balcony, with a good view. The hotel is quiet and the English speaking staff is very helpful. I suggest you have the continental breakfast, delivered to your room. Having petit dejeuner delivered to you, comes with hot-hot coffee and steamed milk and a basket of breads and croissants, butter, jam and orange juice. This makes you stop and take a moment before a day of sight seeing and you get to sit at your cute table and look out the windows and feel like a Parisian. The first day we did not have breakfast in the hotel and save the 10 euros each, as we were going to have croissants and coffee around the corner; but the fabulous and very famous Kayser caf茅 and bakery just around the corner was too busy, and we just kept running, and never stopped till lunch. So the in room breakfast is a treat. This hotel is a perfect location. Close to markets, restaurants, metro鈥檚, buses, taxi stands. The hotel is walking distance to so many good restaurants. I would suggest Christophe Restaurant on 8 Rue Descartes, for a very good bistro meal. I would suggest you get the Pudlo Paris restaurant guide by Gilles Pudlowski, it was a great reference guide with accurate reviews, and for the first time in 2007 is translated to English.Make sure that if booking Hotel Residence in the summer they have air-conditioning. If they don鈥檛 have air-conditioning it could be a problem as the rooms can be stuffy without open windows. For February and at a discounted price this was a great hotel.

Ten minutes walk gets you to Parc du Luxembourg, the Pantheon, or Cathedrale Notre Dame. Friendly staff, free wireless internet, rooms have a small kitchenette.Minuses: Few - it's not very well positioned to Metro stations.Tips: The best Boulangerie near by is Eric Kayser - 8, Rue Monge, 75005 - head north on Rue des Bernardins (toward Notre Dame) one block, turn left on Rue Monge, Kayser is 100 meters on your left.

<Content>Worth considering on the Left Bank I booked this hotel because of its situation, its quietness and the kitchenette included. If you want to stay somewhere on the Left Bank that is not in the middle of the throng, the situation is near perfect: close to buses, metro, RER and within walking distance of Notre Dame, the river, rue St Michel, etc. it was just a short bus ride to Gare de Lyon, which was our next step.We were in room 62, right at the top of the hotel. I think we must have been close to the lift shaft, because there was a slight mechanical hum all the time, but it was reduced by keeping the bathroom door closed. The double-glazing was fairly effective, but the room was not quiet with the window open. The cul-de-sac on which the hotel lies is quite short and runs off rue des Ecoles, which is a busy traffic thoroughfare at all times of the day and night. My particular bugbear is the motorbikes buzzing around, which no amount of double glazing can cut out!The room was reasonably small (17 square metres) but we were getting it on a Winter Special, at 130 euros a night reduced from 230, so no complaints there. it was also spotless and very nicely furnished, with two chairs comfortable enough to sit and read, and good lighting.The breakfast was standard French continental, ie a bit boring for those used to travelling in Switzerland or Germany, let alone North America. The kitchenette was minute and really not suitable for anything except heating up something prepared. It did not run to a kettle (another common lack in France), so we had to heat water in a saucepan to make tea.Staff were exceptionally pleasant and friendly.If location is what matters to you, and you are not a light sleeper, this would make a very good choice for the money.

<Content>Nice Latin Quarter Option Selected this hotel partially because of the Trip Advisor reviews and ranking, and then based on location, etc. The hotel was part of a larger group of hotels in the general area, but I believe it has been sold and is now grouped with another, so it will be interesting to see if that changes the quality or service.Had a two room apartment with both rooms small by US standards but normal for Paris and in nice condition. Between the rooms was a small hall with a minibar/microwave/sink/stove and refridgerator section. Bath was OK. Breakfast was minimal, which does not bother me. 6 euros was a fair price if you wanted it, cheaper than Starbucks in the area for coffee and bread/pastry. Staff were friendly. Location was great, and being a block off the street was very nice. Good for multiple travelors, families. Probably don't need the extra room for a couple or own your own, so save the money.

<Content>Excellent value We stayed here for a week and were very impressed by the quality of the hotel, its central but quiet location and the friendliness of the staff.The hotel is brilliantly situated, a few doors away from a well-stocked wine shop, a couple of minutes from the Metro, and five minutes walk from the Musee de Cluny (home of the magical Lady and the Unicorn tapestries). It is close to Notre Dame, Saint-Chapelle, the Jardin des Plantes, and the Luxembourg Gardens, and within walking distance of the Musee d鈥橭rsay, Pompidou Centre, Picasso Museum and many other delights. Although the hotel has no bar or restaurant, there are many places to eat and drink nearby. Le Cosi, an excellent Corsican restaurant which has a different set menu for lunch each day, is only five minutes walk away. The Place de la Sorbonne is a great place for a drink and people watching.Our room was on the third floor, with a small balcony and a good view along the Rue des Ecoles. The room was a decent size, very clean and well-equipped. The kitchenette was a bonus, particularly the full size fridge, which was useful for keeping food and wine chilled.We were perfectly happy with the hotel breakfast 鈥?strong coffee, fruit juice, croissants, brioche and rye-bread 鈥?although we did hear one American family complaining that it wasn鈥檛 substantial enough for their needs. On one morning, we came downstairs to discover that breakfast had finished early due to an interruption to the electricity supply. We must have looked very disappointed, as, a few minutes later, there was a knock on the door and breakfast was delivered to the room. As we had an early flight, we had to leave before breakfast on the Saturday morning, and asked whether we could have a cup of coffee. When we came down to reception, we found a complete breakfast waiting for us, which was greatly appreciated.We very much enjoyed our stay, would certainly use the hotel again and will recommend it to our friends.

<Content>Hotel Henri delivered the goods!! We have just returned from a 5 day stay in Paris where the first three nights were spent in the Residence Henri IV. We found this hotel quite easily once we arrived and were pleased with the location. On arrival to the hotel we were upgraded to one of the apartments for the first night which was fantastic and a nice surprise as we were told by the staff that this was because it was our first stay with the Residence Henri IV. However it was a little bit of a hassel packing everything up again and having to move to the room next door the following morning.The hotel itself was very good value for money, clean and had a lovely Pariesenne feel to it. The decor was typical of the period it was portraying in its name. Our Parisenne friends we very impressed with it when they came to visit as they had put relatives in other hotels within the vacinity and thought that the standard was much lower. Breakfast delivered to the room was terrific as normally you have to pay for this as room service, however at 140euro per night breakfast should have been included at no extra charge instead of the 6 euro extra.

<Content>Charming centrally located Parisien hotel Down a little side street this charming little hotel waits for you. The staff are very pleasant and helpful and the hotel enjoys a good location 5 minutes walk to the Notre Dame and Pantheon, 20 minutes walk to Musee D'Orsay, 30 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower and 20 minutes walk across the river to Louvre. It's location also takes the problem out of where to eat in the evening since you are literally surrounded by great bistrots and restaurants and cafes, albeit a lot very touristy but you can usually take an educated guess which ones are the tourist havens by the nature of their menu!We chose a superior room booked directly with the hotel which was a nice sized compfortable bed with reasonable furniture in the bedroom and a small lounge area with table and chairs and sofa. We paid 180euro per night for this and breakfast was extra (6euro each....but to be honest, skip it and go to the nearby cafe's!). I've stayed in worse places for similar money in Paris and this is as comfortable as you will find oif you are trudging the city all day without forking out high prices for the room you wont really use that much!Very enjoyable indeed and I'd certainly use it again.

<Content>Great Paris hotel if you can get a good rate Hotel is in a great location, couple of minutes from the Metro, about 10 minutes walk to Notre Dame. Also handy for Rue Mouffetard and in about 15 minutes you can be in the Marais.Room was a much better size than any other I've stayed in in Paris. It was a double and we each had a decent sized wardrobe, there was also plenty of drawer space and a good safe in the room. Also a small kitchenette which was great, as we could buy pastries and other treats from the local boulangerie / patisserie for breakfast! Bathroom was also a good size and spotless with a good shower.We booked online and got an early bird 40% off deal, which made it very reasonable (around 拢70 per night for the room). Otherwise I think it would have been a bit more than what we would usually plan to pay. If you can get a deal like this though I think it's well worth the money.

<Content>Yes, nice little hotel We stayed here for 4 nights and can confirm all the positivdetails as great location, friendly and helpful staff etc.Our room was on the 3 rd floor and we found it on the biggersize (17 qm) compared to lots of other rooms in Paris Hotels.We liked the little kitchenette which was kind of hidden at the entrance of the room. Bathroom was clean and of good size,too. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, but had a look on thebreakfast room: not very welcoming, next to laundry with busy working dryer and washing maschine..Two things why we can麓t give 5 points: no housekeepingwhen we came back at 4.30 p.m. on one day and strong smell of smoke at one night (this is a non smoking place).

<Content>Great location, great little hotel We're just back from our 3 night stay at Hotel Residence Henri IV and were very pleased with our time there. The location is excellent, just a 5 mintue walk from Notre Dame  2 minutes away from the Metro. Get a travel pass  use the Metro, bus  RER to get you all around Paris. The room (62) wasn't huge but it was comfortable  the shower was fine. There was AC and a small kitchenette with sink, microwave, mini fridge  2-burner stove. Breakfast wasn't great but there is an amazing bakery down the road (Eric Kayser's) where you'll get coffee, OJ  a croissant/pastry for 鈧?.50. I highly recommend picking up a sandwich there  having luch beside Notre Dame. There are some amazing restaurants nearby (La Maree Verte  Le Coup-Chou were our favourites) The staff at Hotel Residence Henri IV were very helpful  made reservations for us etc. They all spoke perfect English and were very knowledgable about the area. As our flight was at 7pm they kindly stored our luggage while we did our last bit of sightseeing.To sum up: a comfortable, clean hotel, great staff, great location.

<Content>Hotel Residence Henri IV is trully my residence in Paris This January, my husband, daughter and I stayed for the 4th time at our beloved Residence Henry IV. It truly has a homey feeling. The people who work there are friendly, it is in a nice calm street but in the middle of the Latin Quarter, the apartments are small but cozy, nice and clean, and it is not overpriced in spite of the weakness of the dollar. We'll definitely be going back. My only reservation about writing a review is that I would like to keep it a secret...

<Content>Hooray for Henri IV My husband and two children (aged 10 and 13) recently returned from Paris after staying at this delightful establishment. It is in a great location very close to Notre Dame and the Metro. The decor and ambiance are completely lovely and the room sizes (25m2) were great as we had been told to expect tiny rooms in Paris. The staff were professional, friendly and very helpful. They spoke English and were most helpful to us as both my husband and daughter became ill and needed to see a doctor. The staff arranged appointments and provided directions for us, we simply couldnt have done it so easily without them.I would have no hesitation in recommeding this hotel to anyone and should we return to Paris we would hope to be able to stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel!!! We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. It was in a wonderful location, close to many restaurants, shops, train stations and even a coin laundry! The room was comfortable and well appointed; the kitchenette was especially handy.The staff were friendly and helpful. My husband was not well when we arrived, so the concierge booked us an appointment at a local doctor. On departure, they arranged an airport shuttle for us at a much cheaper rate than a taxi cab.It was easy to get around to tourist spots from the hotel. It's a 5-minute walk to Notre Dame and you can catch a hop-on/hop-off bus called 'Les Cars Rouges' from that point as well.We highly recommend this hotel to travellers who want a restful haven to return to after busy days seeing all the sights of Paris.

<Content>A little sanctuary We have just returned from a 6 week European trip. The majority of our accomodation was booked after reading reviews from Trip Advisor. Hotel Residence Henri IV was a great little find. They provided us with directions from the main station. The hotel is situated in the famous Latin Quarter in a quiet strret overlooking a park and eveything is within walking distance or easily accessible by public transport (e.g. Notre Dame is a 5 min walk.) The hotel is small with only 2 rooms per floor. We stayed in a superior room that provided a pull out sofa bed in the lounge and 2 single beds pushed together to make up a king sized bed in the bedroom. The bathroom was large with heated towel racks and all the ammenities you would expect . An added bonus was a tiny kitchenette with a microwave, bar fridge and hot plate. There was a market down the road where you could buy many delicious things to bring back to the room. Breakfast was not included in our tarrif but there is pleny of variety nearby.The staff were very attentive and polite.Overall, this is one of my favourite hotels from the trip. Our room was fantastic for 2, great for 3 and adequate for 4. My children found the sofa bed a liitle tight and the hotel was not able to provide any additional bedding.

<Content>Wonderful Ditto to all the other positive comments. The hotel was perfectly situated in a lovely part of Paris, and absolutely ideal for a family needing two rooms. The apartment for four was wonderful space for three adults and two young children, and connecting by entry (with a door to close off the stairway) to the other two-person room made it very convenient for two other family members to interact freely. However, what made the hotel exceptional was the STAFF! STAFF! STAFF! They were all genuinely warm, friendly, helpful, and responsive. The management is obviuosly doing the right hiring and training!

<Content>Perfect for a small family! As a couple with a small child we were looking for a one-bed room alternative, with a small kitchen. This was just perfect, and the rooms just beautiful. Paris hotel rooms are normally small (you typically have to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom door), so relative to the norm, this was even quite spacious. E.g. lots of space for a crib next to our queen sized bed in the bed room. Elevator. Nice, new playground just around the corner. Not too far to walk to a very nice little zoo (our 2-year-old loved it!). Nice neighborhood, of course. We were very happy!

<Content>excellent choice The location of HRH IV is perfect -- on a quiet street in the busy Latin Quarter. The multilingual staff go out of their way to help. Despite the chilly weather outside, the room was warm and cozy. If you need your coffee first thing in the morning (as I do) the breakfast in the basement is a good idea; otherwise, it seems a bit dreary down there. In all other ways, HRH IV is a great value.

<Content>Great hotel - fantastic location We really enjoyed the Henri IV. The rooms were very nice, the staff wonderful and the location couldn't be better. Having visited Paris many times, this is the first hotel I would really enjoy returning to stay in. My one suggestion for the hotel (and this is NOT a complaint), is to do a little research and have more non-smoking restaurant suggestions for the guests. Given that you are a non-smoking hotel, I think quite a few people who stay with you are probably looking for this and it would be very helpful. There are so many restuarants in Paris and it can be daunting to sort through them. All in all, a wonderful experience in a Paris hotel.

Very nice mini kitchen facilities which allowed for coffee making and small meals. Clean nicely furnished rooms and hotel is located on a quiet dead end street in a great area in the heart of the latin quarter within walking distance of everything. Front desk staff spoke perfect english and had great recommendations for local cafes and restaurants. Be sure to check out le Petit Prince ( 5 min walk) for an authentic french dinner. Would highly recommend checking the hotels website directly for last minute deals as we got a fantastic rate.

<Content>Very Comfortable little hotel in great location! Have just returned from weekend break in Paris at Hotel Henri IV. The room was booked for my husband, myself and my 15 year old daughter and her friend. We loved the two nice comfortable rooms within the same apartment and the roomy bathroom. We also found it very quiet, free from street noise. We appreciated the kitchenette within the appartment. Great location, used the Autobus to get to the major sites and had great fun shopping locally for baguettes and cheese etc!! The decor was delightful and the rooms lovely and clean. There was even a lift for the older generation, although the kids loved going up and down the spiral staircase. Plenty of inviting caf茅s nearby. We had breakfast in the hotel on our first morning which was very pleasant and we would highly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Our Paris Home Away From Home We recently spent 8 nights at this wonderful hotel. After the first night we instantly felt at home in this place. The room was large, comfortable and clean. The bathroom was clean, well-lit, and the largest we've ever had in Europe. The kitchenette was a nice feature, since we were able to prepare some light meals. The refrigerator was great in keeping some fresh fruits and snacks. And the room was very quiet; we heard very little street noise.The hotel location was very convenient. It is in between two Metro stops, either of which only takes a couple of minutes walk to reach. There is a fresh food market at the Maubert-Mutualit茅 Metro stop three times a week. There are many local shops nearby that sell bread (Eric Kayser is our recommendation), pastries, cheese, fruits, etc. If you prefer convenient food there is a Franprix store around the corner.We loved the small size of the hotel. However, the night desk clerk seems to be the only staff available between 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM. One night at 10:00 PM a fuse blew in our room causing half the room 鈥?and the bathroom 鈥?to be dark. This did not affect power to the kitchenette, TV and the desk lamp. We called to the front desk and they were unable to help. The next morning at 7:30 AM I went down to the front desk to mention our problem. It was immediately fixed to our satisfaction.We have no doubt that the next time we are in Paris we are going to stay here 鈥?if rooms are available.

<Content>Very happy with our stay. We spent four nights at the Henri IV in September, having booked on the basis of favourably Tripadvisor reviews.We were very impressed with the Henri IV. The staff were welcoming, spoke good English, and were always happy to provide assistance with our various queries or requirements during our stay.Our room was of a good size for a European hotel, light and airy, well-equipped, with an outlook across a flower filled window box to the small park which faces the hotel. The bathroom was spacious, modern and, like the room, spotlessly clean. The small kitchenette in the room was very useful, mainly for tea and coffee, but also for assembling the occasional lunch or evening meal from ingredients purchased from the numerous nearby delis.We were very happy with the location of the hotel. The immediate area hosts countless restaurants, cafes and other convenience stores, and the Maubert Metro station is just a short walk away. Notre Dame is a 10 minute walk, and it is possible to pick up the L'Open bus tours from just outside the cathedral.The hotel serves a light breakfast in a small dining area in the basement of the building, and this was included in our tariff. In hindsight, it would probably have been more enjoyable (and entertaining) sitting outside one of the nearby cafes for a coffee and croissant.We highly recommend the Henri IV as a quiet, comfortable place to stay in the midst of this fascinating city.

I picked this hotel from the pictures on the website as I wanted to stay in a typically Parisian hotel in the centre of the city and was not disappointed. Only two rooms on each floor, but full of character and very comfortable. The staff were really friendly and the only drawbacks were the lack of a view over Notre Dame and a fairly meagre breakfast. The location was great, Metro very close - had a great stay.

<Content>Outstanding small hotel We stayed here for two nights at the end of a two week trip in France and it was outstanding. The location, just a few blocks from the Latin Quarter, Notre Dame, Pantheon and Luxembourg Gardens, was perfect. The staff could not have been nicer or more accomodating. Our room was probably the smallest in the hotel (it was on the top floor with a slanted room line), but it was very comfortable with a small balcony and nice size bathroom. Since this is a former student hotel, the rooms include a small refrigerator, microwave and sink. We found this hotel at the last minute on eurobookings.com which required no upfront deposit or cancellation fees, and when other sites came up with no choices in this area. It is a little pricey, but not as outrageous as some.

She rang and rang for us and after 3 days it finally turned up.I was very disappointed with Air France's attitude but that is another story.If looking for a first class hotel at a reasonable price look no further. We had the top floor room 61 and 62 was our friends room. It was gorgeous, the balconies had a great view, and the little kitchen came in handy. Spotlessly clean. Bathroom en-suite was a great size.All in all the best stay and a big thank you to Anna leise.Carmel

<Content>Great little hotel; perfect location The hotel is in a perfect location. It's easy to walk to Notre Dame (8-10 minutes), the Sorbonne (4 minutes), or Luxembourg Gardens (6-7 minutes). It's also close to the metro and the nearest cab stand is only a few minutes away. There are lots of places to eat nearby. As a bonus, the street ends at the hotel, so it's very quiet at night.As reported, the rooms are roomy, and it's nice to have a microwave, fridge and little stove in the room. We stayed in a room on the ground floor right behind the hotel desk. I think the rooms on the upper floors look cozier, but our room was a little larger than the other singles, and we never had a problem with noise from the lobby.The desk staff is the real treasure at this hotel. They are wonderful. Odile, Patrice, and Hicham are all charming and very helpful. There was never any hesitation to help us in any way at all. While they were all very professional, after 6 nights, I felt like they were also my friends.I would absolutely recommend the Hotel Residence Henri IV, and I hope to stay there again.

My sister from Toronto, Canada, myself (from Saskatoon, Canada) and my two teenage girls stayed for a week at Hotel Residence Henri IV....It was perfect for us - for many reasons 1) spacious (two rooms; one with twin beds and one with a double bed; large bathroom with tub, sitting area where we dined on baguettes, cheese and wine, mini fridge, sink and dishes; it also has the loveliest balcony; it was bright, airy, very clean, spacious for a European hotel; hotel service was excellent i.e. reception and cleaning staff; location was superb; we took the RER from CDG airport all the way to our subway stop and walked over a couple of blocks to the hotel....close to the Seine, therefore, easy walking distance to the islands and the right bank; market, Pantheon, Blvd St. Germain, Luxemborg Gardens; great wine, cheese shoppes and cafes right in the neighborhood; I would highly recommend this hotel and I will stay there again when I go back....

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We have just returned from our trip to Paris and England and stayed at the Residence Henri IV for 4 nights from Aug 9 to Aug 13. We are a family of five so we had one superior and one double room. They gave us both rooms on the same floor so we could close the outer door and had the whole floor to ourselves. The rooms were large and very comfortable. The hotel is very well located, only a few blocks from the Notre Dame and close to a lot of good restaurants and the metro. Another nice plus was that we had wireless access in our room. The staff were excellent, they all spoke good English and were extremely helpful. They helped us with directions, restaurant recommendations and also made dinner reservations for us. On our last night the elevator broke down and being a Sunday night it was difficult to get someone to come fix it, but since we were leaving early morning and had to get our bags down, the lady at front desk managed to get someone to come and fix it that night and called us in the morning to let us know it was fixed. She also had a pot of coffee ready for us in the morning. We had a wonderful experience at this hotel and we would certainly stay at this hotel again if we were visiting Paris.

<Content>Double bed madness This little hotel has oodles of grungy charm, with shutters, fireplaces, cornices, a balcony, a wrought iron spiral staircase etc and its location is lovely. There are loads of non-touristy restaurants and shops around (including an ace organic artisan boulangerie) - so far, so good. Our problem was that we took one of the rooms for four people. My parents (fit, mobile and in their late 60's/eary 70's) were fine because we gave them the two single beds pushed together to make a double. We got the the 'double' - a cheap double mattress balanced on what looked like a SINGLE bed base propped up with cushions. It had a hard mattress protector on it that wrinkled into 2 cm high waves under the sheet, leaving our bodies marked with red ridges that were very painful. My partner and I had four sleepless nights, waking up with aching hips, knees and backs. Yes I'm 7 months pregnant so sleep doesn't necessarily come easy, but this was the worst hotel bed I've ever slept in, and this hotel isn't in the budget range. Thus I'd say: if there's two of you, go for it. If there's 3 or more, find another, hotel, if necessary compromising on the charm or location - the second bed isn't worth it.

<Content>Loved Hotel Residence Henri IV I booked this hotel after reviews from this site and we were not disappointed. Our original concern was only that the room might be too small at 17m2 but this was not the case. We were on the third floor (with lift), had a lovely little standing terrace, a lovely spacious room that was big enough for our bed and a cot with room still to move and a lovely big bathroom with bath. It also had a kitchenette with fridge, hotplates and microwave.The staff were really helpful and friendly and we found it a central place to stay. It was in the 5th arr. and close to a lot of things. We were close to a few metro stations plus within walking distance to Notre Dame and the Latin Quarter.Overall we loved our room and were really happy we chose it. We would stay there again without a doubt.

<Content>Charming lovely nHotel, great location . Me and my wife,stayed at this charming romantic little hotel for ten days and we loved it.The rooms,tastefully decorated and with a veranda ,were large enough for Paris standards and cosy. The same stands for its bathrooms which overlooks a small alley and a back yard sort of garden.The hotel itself is located in the cultural center of Paris. Five minutes walk from Paris university and Polytechnic, seven minutes walk from Notre Dame and 3 minutes from Pantheon and rue Mouftar .It takes no more than half an hour walking for Jardin du Louxembourg and 15 minutes from Boulevard St Michel .The staff of the hotel ,without exception, was friendly ,polite but also highly professional .A special thanks to Mademoiselle Annoulice (If my spelling is right) for her help regarding the booking of a ballet performance and for her always warm welcoming smile.One big plus of the hotel was that it had opposite to it a bus stopwhere from, one could easilly and comfortably (we were never standing) access the whole Paris either by direct bus lines or by interconnections at Blv St Michel. Some of the buses run until late at night 00:30 hrs. It is worth buyng carnets of 10 billets because it comes a bit cheaper and it has the advantage that you can use the same ticket for one route regardless how many buses you have changed for the inteconnection.Next to the hotel there are two Metro stations but we only used the Metro twice because the bus sometimes was quicker and by travelling by bus we could see the whole Paris .Another hint is to buy a 5 days ticket of unlimitted travel with the bateaubus for 17 euros (1day ticket cost 13 euros).You can practically see the most important Meuseems and tour Eiffel by embarking at Notre Dame and at the same time enjoying the river Seine.The last one as far as I remember leaves at 20:30 hrs.Many restaurants both for International and French cuisine were next to the hotel. We tried the Spanish one,the Thibetian,the Indian,the Armenian , the Argentinian and the French one near Ecole Politecnique .We were very satisfied from most of them especially the Thibetian ,the Argentinian and the Spanish one.The French one was good too.It comes cheaper if you order the three course meal formule.All in all we strongly recomend this nice hotel.If the price will not be drammatically increased we will certainly stay here again in our next visit to beautifull Paris.P.S The breakfast although continental was quite satisfying considering its price.We preferred to have it in the room since the dinning room although nice and immaculately clean had no sunlight as it was at the basement of the hotel.

<Content>Henry IV Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In!!! Henry IV was an experience in itself! Located on the Left Bank, it was a five minute walk from the Seine, Notre Dame, and Ile de St. Louis. Location made us feel like we were in the heart of Paris! It was near bakeries, cafes and open air markets. My husband and two teenage daughters and I fell in love with Henry IV. Staff were gracious and offered us help with even the smallest travel questions. Rooms were elegant, with high ceilings and lovely decor. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was fine for the four of us. It even had a balcony! We would never stay anywhere else in Paris. Thank you Henry IV for making our Paris stay so memorable.

<Content>Snug gem! Tucked away behind the Pantheon in the Latin Quarter, this boutique hotel is really worth considering. You won't find a pool, or air conditioning apart from a fan - but you will find pleasant, helpful staff and clean, compact but very comfortable and affordable rooms. The area is ideal for some interesting walks: try the Jardin des Plantes or the Luxembourg Gardens (magic!). There are restaurants just around the corner, at one of those wonderful happening intersections.Ideal for couples and explorers-on-foot.

<Content>Very convenient choice We only stayed for one night in room 1, which is on the ground floor. Nonetheless we slept well, since the hotel is situated in an unusally quiet street. At the same time, it is ideally located within Rive Gauche Paris. The room was large - in fact unusally large for Parisian standards - and had everything we needed. The place is spotlessly clean. The bed was very good.

<Content>Great Location! Our experience here was wonderful from the start...the front desk (Annalise) was warm and friendly. Our room was on the first floor which made it very convenient to come and go....the elevator is very old and small. Our room and bed was very comfortable--not huge sized but not tiny either. We really enjoyed the microwave, refrigerator, and burners....however no pans to use on the burners, but other dishes were provided. There is no air conditioning, but we lucked out on having pretty moderate weather and a window on the front and one in the back so we could easily get a cross breeze. We also asked for a fan which we kept the whole time. We would stay here again!

<Content>Parisian Perfection My niece and I stayed in the Hotel Residence Henri IV in April, 2007. We were throughly pleased with the accomodations that we received at the hotel. Although we were promised a room somewhat higher up (on the 6th floor), the room we were given on the 3rd floor overlooking the pretty little park was wonderful. I have been to Paris several times and I have not found a hotel as quaint, clean, and spacious as this one. The staff were excellent, pleasant, and helpful. The room was ALWAYS cleaned each morning, and made up by the time of our return in the afternoons. We were truly ecstatic with the hotel and our stay there. I would plan to stay there every time I return to Paris. It was a great location. Even though a 3 star hotel, I would definitely give the Hotel Residence Henri IV a 4 star rating!!!Thank you to the hotel and staff for a lovely experience.

<Content>All ok We chose to stay at Henry IV for 3 reasons, the location, air conditioning and partial kitchen facilities. All was ok except space around the kitchen area was very limited. No room to prepare anything. A cafetiere to make coffee would have been a bonus. However, it was great to be able to have a full size fridge so we could buy preprepared foods that just needed heating in the microwave. The charcuteries and a closeby Champion supermarket made this easy.The staff were helpful to a limited extent - a couple were actually somewhat on the negative side, but I asked one of the night staff to book me a train ticket online and she very kindly did this. The night staff are much more responsive to requests as they have the time available. As this was my first visit to Paris I wasn't prepared for the lack of services rendered but we stayed at five hotels around France and this was general. The room was a good size, very clean and had everything we required. I would definitely stay there again. Can't comment on the breakfast but at 6 Euros it was certainly the cheapest we came across.

<Content>Delightful staff at Henri IV We had read a positive review of this hotel in the UK Observer's Top Hotels for under 拢100 in Paris, but obviously didn't know what to expect in terms of location, ambience, etc. From the outset, every member of staff was absolutely charming, and spoke good English (though we used our French as well). They allowed us to book in early as our room was ready. We had a little room on the ground floor made up for 2 adults and a small child. It was small, but beautifully furnished, and spotlessly clean. The bathroom had heated flooring, and a good shower over the bath. There was a fridge and facilities to cook, which we did not use. The bed was VERY comfortable, and despite our location behind the reception desk, reasonably quiet. The location was fantastic - about 10 mins walk to Notre Dame, and surrounded by beautiful streets and buildings, with lots of good eateries. Breakfast was simple but filling, served in a rather tiny breakfast room. We would definitely recommend the hotel, though if you are looking for a lot of space, this would not be the hotel for you. (Bear in mind that we did not see the rooms upstairs, which might be larger - worth checking.)

<Content>Charming hotel in a great neighborhood! I stayed at this lovely hotel for four nights with my husband and nine-year old twin daughters. I booked one of the apartments, which turned out to be comfortable and perfect for us. It was not spacious like an American apartment, but by European standards, it had plenty of room. There is so much to like about this hotel, I hardly know where to start. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful and never too busy for our questions. Everyone we dealt with spoke English very well so we did not have to resort to our fractured French.The neighborhood this hotel sits in is charming and quintessential left-bank . Right around the corner, about a five minute walk away, is a wonderful boulangerie, cheese shop, green grocer, wine shop and bistro. And about twice a week, there is a farmer's market here where you can buy everything from fresh fish and foie gras to table linens and jewelry.The metro station and lots of other shops are located here as well.You can easily walk to Notre Dame or the Pantheon from this hotel. Both are about a ten minute walk.The other big benefit of the location of this hotel is the street it sits on. It's a cul-de-sac with a small park on one side, so it is much quieter than you would expect from a big city hotel.I think the only weakness of this hotel is the breakfast it offers. The dining room is painfully small and the menu is very limited. Although, to be fair, they will bring your breakfast up to your room for no extra charge. But given the fact that there are so many other options for breakfast in the neighborhood, this was not a big deal for us. Overall, we had a very positive experience staying here and would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Staff We just spent a wonderful five days in Paris staying at the Residence Henri IV. The hotel is a very attractive hotel in a great location on a quiet side street. It's only a couple blocks from Notre Dame and the Seine and near many restaurants and cafes on Rue Monge and Saint Germain des Pres. We were a family of four (with an 11 and 14 year old) and the apartment rooms were very adequate in size. The bathroom was great - clean and with good water pressure in the shower. The staff is extremely helpful and all spoke excellent English. We were able to walk to many places and the metro was nearby when needed. One tip we got from this website was attending a classical music concert at Sainte Chapelle (classictic.com). The concerts are at 7:00 and 8:30 - only an hour - so worked well for our kids, but what a beautiful way to sit and enjoy great music and the beautiful stained glass windows in the chapel. And it was easily walking distance from the hotel. We had a great trip and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Friendly, Comfortable, Wonderful This was my second visit to Paris and my first stay at this hotel. It was just... great. Everything. Great location too. The employees at the front desk were friendly, accommodating, helpful and seemed to be genuinely invested in my friend and I having a safe, fun stay in the city. I highly recommend the continental breakfast - the breads were delicious, the coffee snaps you awake and the staff are friendly and competent. When we arrived, we were at first given a room on the ground floor. We let staff know we preferred a room upstairs and after our second night, they allowed us to move upstairs. I want to stress that the room on the first floor was very nice. It was simply a personal preference. Our room upstairs was also very comfortable, a little more spacious and more light. A cute little kitchenette that definitely comes in handy, a great shower, hair dryers, flat screen tv and a window box of geraniums. Perfect.

The staff was knowledgeable and friendly and the room was clean and well appointed.We had a 2 room suite with mini kitchen. We used the microwave, fridge and utensils. It's probably too small for real cooking but it wasn't an issue for us because we don't do any real cooking on vacation anyways. The location near the Pantheon is great and was about a 15 minute walk to Notre Dame. There is a great bakery just around the corner. Then again, there's a great bakery around the corner virtually everywhere in Paris!

<Content>Beautiful little hotel We stayed at the Henri IV four days in May 2007. Excellent location, close to the Notre Dame and the islands, Rue Mouffetard (lively even when everything else in Paris was closed on a Sunday), Pantheon and St. Germain. Close to metro-stations and very central, still fairly quiet location. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Nice and cheap breakfast (6 euro each), although we most of the mornings preferred to eat at one of the nearby bistros. Spacious room, with a little balcony with flowers and view overlooking a small garden and a central street further down. Got the hotel to book tickets at the Louvre, which resulted in no queue at all at the museum. A hotel we definitely wold like to come back to, or try one of the sister hotels.Norwegian couple, 29 and 30, 28. May 2007.

<Content>Excellent for those who know European hotels This is a wonderful quant hotel convienent to everything. The most important it is quiet, it is at the end of a street. The staff is friendly and the rooms a clean. The galley kitchen is great to make breakfast and to keep snacks. If this is your first trip to Europe, word of advise. Learn 5-10 French words, it shows you care about their culture. My wife and I found the French to be some of the friendliest people in Europe. Dress properly for dinner (no blue jeans) and bring your manners with you. Paris is a beautifully cultured city you will have more fun when you blend in. PS. bring your own soap, euro hotels give you a bar the size of a quarter.

<Content>Lovely Little Hotel, Centre of Everything! My mum  I visted Paris from 23rd - 27th April. Our stay in this hotel was perfect. I had read all the reviews and they were all really good. I had my reservations about the fridge and small cooker etc, however it was fine. We didnt make use of the facilities apart from the fridge. There is no kettle so any water you need boiled is best done in the microwave. We tried the hob to boil some water but took forever. The location is perfect. It is around 400m from the Pantheon. Notre Dame is about 600m directly down the hill. There is a big street about 500 m away - some nice shops. The hotel is at the end of a very short cul-de-sac. The staff are just the most helpful you can imagine. All speak English perfectly! We had a room on the ground floor that was just beside the reception. I was concerned that we would be woken by people coming and going through the night - but didnt hear a peep! So if you get this room, it's not as bad as you might think.Places to eat nearby - we were recommended Le Coup Coup (or something similar). From the crowd in the place we expected it to be wonderful... However it was less than so. The Rack of Lamb, was definately not a lamb - more Mutton. And it smelled like mutton. The duck was ok, as was the soup. Generally we didnt get any good evening meals. Of 3 places recommended to us 2 were pretty average and the third was ok. So make your own mind up on hotels recommendations.Nice lunch can be got at a place on the boulevard down from the Pantheon - cant remember the name but it was packed solid even at 2.30! its on the left if Pantheon is at your back - think its about the third or fourth place. Otherwise we found the Lourve and Musee D'Orsey restuarants very decent!In all I would definately recommend this hotel to people. Only draw back is there is no bar or resturaunt in the place but theres loads within a stones throw!

<Content>A wonderful visit to Paris at the Hotel Residence Henri IV. We have just spent 2 incredible weeks in the Hotel Residence Henri IV. The staff are wonderful. The rooms are huge (for Paris or New York for that matter). You can sleep 2 children on the pull out couch. For those days when you wish to dine in there is a small kitchenette. The location is fantastic (Latin quarter) walking distance to everything. Our only fear in giving to good a review is in not being able to book a room in the future.If you are going to Paris for a week or a month this is the place for you (and your kids).

<Content>A+ for the Hotel Residence Henri IV The best recommendation we could give: We will stay with them again! Fabulous location, which is paramount for us. The room was clean and larger than any we have experienced in Paris. The bathroom was large and new. I think the hotel had been recently renovated and it was pristine. The front desk was helpful and friendly. The breakfast was the only minus - However, the need thereof forced us to find charming and very tasty boulangeries close by. Finally, the price for value is as good as it gets. I recommend highly.

<Content>Careful Unfortunately, the booking practice of this hotel appears to be deceptive. A few days ago I was offered a last minute rate which I accepted and furnished my credit card details within the period required by the hotel. Their response was they were sorry but the room had already been rented. We all know that the hotels will hold aroom for a definite period pending receipt of credit card details so there was no mistake. Obviously, they found someone to rent at the normal rate. I am sure the hotel is lovely but the traveler needs to be careful in dealing with them. This is an issue of honesty. My wifehad warned me to look elsewhere after reading the recent report on Tripadvisor of items being stolen from a room at night. I should havelistened. I am sure the manager will reply with his explanation of the mistake. This was not a mistake! Shame, shame!!}}|['=

<Content>Excellent staff who provided superb recommendations The hotel is just off the main Rue St Germaine with its fabulous restaurants and cafes. It sits in a quiet corner and is small and very friendly. The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable but the best aspect was the helpful staff. They provided some excellent recommendations of places to eat each evening - we would suggest trying Balzar and Bouillon Raccine as typically french restaurants with excellent food and service.Overall, a great place to stay, very convenient for Notre Dame and Ile de Cite

<Content>A Charming and Comfortable Hotel My husband, son, and I very much enjoyed our 5-night stay at Residence Henri IV, and will definitely stay there again. We were very comfortable: while the hotel is small and charming, the room we had was spacious, especially for Paris (two separate rooms with beds, a kitchenette, and a large marble bathroom). There's lots of light, easy wifi, plenty of plugs, and the most wonderful staff -- the woman and two men who in turn staffed the front desk were always willing to help with a smile, giving us information about museum passes, metro access, sites, distances, taxis, location of a nearby grocery, good bakery, etc., and I even got crucial help in a wardrobe crisis. This is in stark contrast to the report we got from a friend who stayed in an upscale Paris hotel last year. Members of the housekeeping staff were also gracious, instilling a sense of security, and they consistently did a great job with the room.The location is good for sight-seeing and sleeping well. The hotel islocated at the end of a short street, across from a park, so it's very quiet, but at the same time, it's only a couple of blocks from Blvd. Saint-Germain, and a few more blocks over to Blvd. Saint-Michel. There are a few tables on the lower level where they provide a small breakfast (6 euros), which we found very convenient on days when we were rushing out. The coffee was excellent!

<Content>Loved the Hotel Residence Henri IV My wife and I spent 7 wonderful nights at the Hotel Henri, and found it to be excellent. We loved the small kitchenette with microwave and refrigerator and hotplate. We also loved the location which was in a wonderful neighborhood of small shops and reasturants, not touristy at all.We were close to the Metro, Notre Dame, the Seine...and within walking distance of shopping (my wifes first love) ATM's, everything you need.The staff was courteous and helpfull and always willing to help.I would strongly recomend this hotel to anyone wanting a stay in Paris in a typical Parisian neighborhood, with lots of shopping, cafe's, etc to keep you busy.

<Content>Fantastic for a young family! We stayed at this charming little hotel in March 2007. We have an 18 month old and found the small kitchenette to be indispensible to our stay in Paris. It is very hard to find an apartment hotel other than the Citadines. The Henri IV service was fantastic and we came back everyday to a spotless room. (at the Citadines you only get one cleaning per week) We paid less than 100 Euros a night and booked this on the official hotel website.The location was excellent, we couldn't believe how close we were to Notre Dame and the river. Also many, many restaurants are nearby as well as grocery stores, pharmacies, bakeries, etc. We loved the Greek area near St Michel Blvd.There are several metros within walking distance, Maubert and Cardinal Lemoine being the closest.Museum wise, very close to the hotel is the Musee du National Moyen Age de Cluny is fantastic! What a great find, also not very busy with tourists, just some school groups were there. Also the Catacombs of Paris are a short metro ride away and are of great interest. Not too be missed are the many little churches in the area. Also only a couple streets away is the Pantheon.I would recommend this hotel to very small families with young children.

<Content>Good choice for visiting Paris After reading other reviews for this hotel and other hotels, I chose it based on the location (central place, but still quite), room size (large by Paris standards - 17sqm) and, of course, the general impression of the other guests.I was not disapointed in none of these items, and I might add some pluses: it's in a walking distance from a Metro station direct from the airport (RER B), avoiding changing stations with luggage. The hotel is small and cozy, nicely decorated in Paris style, the staff is nice and glad to help.The bathroom is also very nice (once again, compared to other hotels in Paris is quite big) and has a big window with direct sun light, what is great. However, the only problem of the room is that the door that separtes the bathroom from the room is a door with glasses, which caused the room to be fully lighted by 8 am (in summer should be sooner), not allowing me to sleep further. Not a big problem, because I wanted to wake up early to visit Paris, but I confess in some days I would have slep a little longer.The room had a little kitchen inserted in a closet with a small stove, microwaves, a fridge and a sink, which can be very helpfull.The hotel served a continental breakfast, at an attractve price for Paris (6 鈧?, but too simple for an hotel. The breakfast room was very small, but once again, the hotel ofered to serve it in your room with no extra cost.The room had a nice LCD Tv, however with limited channels.Overall, the Minus points are only tiny details and the stay was very nice. I would absolutely recomend this hotel, at the rate I got it - through an early booking promotion in their site I payed 490鈧?for 4 nights, which I consider a good value for money for a very nice 3 star hotel, 500 meters from the Notre Damme Cathedral in a very quite place. It was a very nice place to come back and relax after a day of walking around the city.

<Content>beware of thief in your room Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. Stayed with two friends. When we arrived we enquired if we could have two keys to the room, as we would be returning at different times. I was concerned because our room could be left unlocked. The hotel staff advised that there would be no problem as the front door was not left unattended. So much for this, during the night someone entered the room( more worrying because my friends were in bed) and stole a number of items, mobile phone, PDA etc. This really destroyed a great visit to the city. So my advice if there are more than one of you and you need to arrange different return times, this is not the hotel for you

<Content>Great little spot the hotel is in a great location in the latin quarter, close to the pantheon, boulevard st. germain and notre dame cathedral. plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants in the area. the hotel is kept very well and you are assured a friendly welcome. our room was on the 6th floor which was quaint with a little kitchenette, ample size bedroom and en suite bathroom, but the coolest thing was the little balcony overlooking the paris rooftops (wish i was back there now, sipping on a glass of wine).fantastic boulangeries around the corner, so we opted to eat out for breakfast, wine shops, cheese shops and a market on tuesdays and thursdays. with 3 metro stops nearby i would highly recommend this hotel for a great stay in paris.

The neighborhood was filled with friendly people,markets,cafes.etc. I was sad to leave. I highly reccomend this hotel to anyone travelling to Paris. When I return to Paris this will again be my home away from home.

<Content>First time's a charm! I've been to Paris many times, staying at small hotels usually in the 5th or 4th. We booked a 1 bdr at the Henri IV, which had a living room, small kitchen (microwave, silverware, some dishes) and - by Parisian standards - a huge bathroom. Our room was lovely with a fireplace-y sort of thing that had a cubby to put stuff - and quiet, even with the windows open. Very charming all in all.there was a balcony in the bedroom and the one off the living room was big enough to put two chairs, drink coffee and people watch. The staff was fantastic. My friend left her (favorite) scarf behind, they found it and are sending it back for shipping fees, which i think is fair. The best part was the location. We could walk down the Rue des Bernadins toward the river in about 5 minutes and land at the bridge joining Ile de Cite and the Ile St. Louis, which is my favorite place (go to restaurant L'Ilot Vache if you can, on the Rue ile de st. louis).

<Content>Will be advising all our friends to go straight here when in Paris We booked our accomodation at Hotel Residence Henri IV at the last minute after having a couple of nights in Paris at a much smaller (tiny) hotel and as such we were quite hesitant about how it would turn out. We couldn't have been happier with the hotel. We booked an apartment (relatively cheap rates for last minute deal) and found it it very comfortable, and in a fantastic location. Plenty of cafe's, boulangerie's, patisserie's etc (so no need to pay extra for breakfast) very close by, and easy walking to the nearest metro. Definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Comfortable  Just returned from 3 days in Paris . Stayed @ Henri IV. The accommodation for myself and my husband and my eight year old daughter was excellent. It comprised of two rooms , one with a double bed and the other with a double sofa bed , which was very comfortable, a small kitchenette and a bathroom.The decor and cleanliness were excellent. The kitchenette was a great advantage with a child as we could buy in food that she liked and have our breakfast in the room.Avoid the hotel breakfast. Even for a continental breakfast it is very poor and a waste of 鈧?.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is situated not far from the Metro and within walking distance of Notre Dame Cathedral.All in all a very nice place to stay and I would recommend it to fellow travellers.

<Content>Loved the location, hospitality and convenience We have just returned from a wonderful 5 day (4 nights) in Paris. Our hotel selection was based on location, convenience, price and other reviews. The Hotel Residence Henri IV met all of our qualifications and exceded our expections!!The desk staff was friendly, helpful and fluent in English. The rooms were very clean and well looked after and, in our case, freshly painted. The location was central for the Latin Quarter, very close to the Sorbonne, as well as walking distance to so many other areas that were of interest to us. In addition, the Metro was very close for locations that were not in walking distance. We were in a Superior room that afforded us an additional room off the bedroom for one to read while the other slept. I believe all rooms have efficiency kitchens, ours did. This added to the convenience and enjoyment as shopping for essentials was easy and made us feel connected to the residential neighborhood. A wonderful market was also very close where fresh produce, in addition to meats, fish and cheeses were available. Mostly we enjoyed looking at the displays of food. Instead of feeling like tourists, we felt, albeit briefly, like we belongedWe highly recommed this location, hotel and area especially if traveling with children or otherwise want to take advantage of the local shops, bakeries and markets.

<Content>Another wonderful visit to Henri Cat Our visit to Henri IV was thoroughly enjoyable. As it has been on previous occasions, the staff was attentive and helpful, the rooms quiet and clean and the accomdations were comfortable. We stayed in two different rooms over the space of a week, no. 32 and no. 62. No. 62 was unique, and charming in a way, but the wireless connection was not available that high up in the building. This was a minor inconvenience. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay and plan to return at our earliest convenience to stay in this wonderful small Parisian Hotel. Thank you for your continuing courtesies to our family.Best regards,Chris and Lee Foeger

<Content>An Australian perspective - wonderful hotel! Wonderful, parisian experience! We are an Australian family of 2 adults and 3 kids aged 15,13 and 9 years. We booked 2 rooms through the website which had a special winter deal so was great value for a hotel in this location.We arrived at night and were warmly welcomed with chocolates and a card and as it turned out, each floor only has 2 rooms so we were the only occupants of the 5th floor!My husband and I had a queen/king sized bed with tiny, cute balcony overlooking the quiet street and gorgeous bathroom with view of the back courtyards and rooftops - very Parisian! The kids stayed next door in a larger apartment with 2 single beds in a separate bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room. Both hotel rooms had a kitchenette which was very clean and suitable for simple meals.The rooms were spotlessly clean and we were very impressed with the french style furnishings. We felt we were having the genuine french experience as the staff were all friendly and helpful and the lively streets nearby were interesting and had plenty of food choices from cafes to boulangerie and markets. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying again as soon as we can make it over there from Australia.

<Content>Good Place for a typical short stay in Paris Spent two nights at this hotel - got a good rate on a superior room - the room was very nice - spotlessly clean - there was absolutely no street noise (or at least I did not hear any as I slept so well in the very comfortable bed). The location is perfect for a typical Paris visit (if you take the RER from CDG and have some luggage it's better then to transfer to Line 10 and get out at Maubert Mutualit茅)I felt the some of the bathroom fittings should be renewed in keeping with the superior room  tag and I cerrtainly was not tempted by the kitchen - in my opinion the breakfast was a big disappointment - I did not bother having it the second morning although it was included in the price. Plently of places nearby to eat and drink in real Parisian atmosphere. At the special rate it was good value for money relatively speaking - I would have found it too expensive at the normal rate - my advice is negotiate a special rate excluding breakfast.Just outside the hotel door is the church of St. Nicolas du Chardonnet as I understand it occupied by traditionalsists where mass is celebrated in Latin - at the other end of the theological scale and also closeby is the church Mont Saint Michel where monks and nuns from the monestaic community of Jeruselem celebrate almost a theatrical sung mass. I enjoyed both experiences in different ways.

<Content>I will sugges it to everyone! I spent 2 nights at this great hotel with my boyfriend. We were on holiday in Paris for the first time and had previously spent 1 night at the Sully Hotel that is in the same street. The place was so dirty and decandent that I didn't want to spend more time there! Luckily I walked by the Henry IV and I asked if there were available rooms.The guy at the help desk was extremely kind, shew us an apartment at the 5th floor that we decided to book for the 2 following nights. The bed is comfortable, there is a small kitchenette ( I needed it to prepare hot tea at night cause I was ill!!) and a nice living room. All newly renovated but in typical french style.The bath is not huge but really clean. There's also a small terrace usefull for the smokers!The location is perfect, really near the Notre Dame cathedral, at 2 steps of La Sorbonne, so full of nice restaurants and pubs for all tastes. The price is honest for what is offered, especially in comparison with the Sully St. Germain above mentioned. I'll definitely come back there if I have the opportunity.

<Content>A true gem A warm, comfortable and friendly hotel in a great location - a very short walk to the Seine and many other attractions. Yet despite being in such a convenient part of Paris I experienced very little traffic noise in my higher floor room. Whether it was because of the friendly and helpful staff, or the very unhotel like spacious nature of my room, I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>Good value in pleasant environment After a slightly rough start (night porter was distracted by phone calls; got a room on a low floor having requested one higher up; a wall panel above the door to my room almost fell on me when I entered), things got much better. My room was changed to one on a higher up floor after the first night. The staff was attentive and friendly. The rooms are huge by Paris standards, well-maintained, and feel personal.The surroundings are nice, many shops and restaurants. The hotel lies in a quiet cul-de-sac. No problem to sleep with open windows. The initial glitches were easily forgiven and I enjoyed my stay very much. I got the room at a reduced internet rate for ca 100 Euro. This is clearly a bargain. If I can get the room for a similar rate I will definitely use the hotel again next time when I stay in Paris.

<Content>Left Bank gem My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in November 2006. The room was quite pleaseant and above average in size for Paris. Nice bathroom - not sumptuous but attractive, all the necessaries and a decent size with a big window overlooking a garden and other apartments - you are not looking at a brick wall. The bed was very comfortable. Two closets, a desk, small table, 2 chairs and aqequate room to wander around - a real bonus! The front window overlooks a small park and the street.The room was quiet as it is set down a small side street.We had breakfast in the hotel one morning but it was nothing special.The real plus for this hotel is the small kitchen facility - sink, fridge, hotplate (2 burner). There are loads of cafes which offer breakfast at the same price as the hotel in the area. Also, there is a lovely boulangerie just up the road and a small grocery store around the corner so it is much, much cheaper to buy your own breakfasts, store in the fridge and have what youy want instead of the standard fare. You could also manage other meals if necessary because of the facilities. The desk staff were excellent as is the overall location of the hotel. You will be spoilt for choice as far as restaurants are concerned. Great location for Notre Dame, Pantheon, Metro, RER, shopping and the Left Bank.We would definitely stay here again.Chris  Jan, Oakville, Ontario, Canada.

<Content>Utterly charming hotel in great location I went to Paris with 3 girlfriends in November  we stayed at the Henri IV for 2 nights. The room we had booked was an apartment for 4 people; it was a little cramped as the 2nd double is a sofa bed, but the suite itself was beautiful, charming  did the trick of providing a comfortable, convenient base for us. The hotel itself is lovely, tucked on a leafy side-street, and the main feature is the beautiful original staircase that winds the whole way up the centre of the building. Our room had beautiful original features and was very clean  comfortable. It was also excellent value for money. If you are going for a longer trip then I think the apartment would be too small for 4 adults, but other than that we had a very enjoyable stay  were well looked after by the very helpful, charming staff.

<Content>highly recommended We booked a double room for 110 Euro/night via www.booking.com which was much less than the hotel's rack rate. On arrival we were upgraded to a small suite on the 4th floor (room 42) which was a bonus. The bedroom was a fairly good size for Paris  in a good state of repair. No problems with street noise which can often be a issue in Paris. There was also a small sitting room with table, chairs  a sofa-bed. The bathroom was well-appointed and with plenty of hot water. Another bonus was the small kitchen area which had 2 hotplates, a microwave, fridge and sink.The hotel is very well-situated, about 5 mins walk from the metro and lots of good restaurants within a few minutes.Service was helpful  friendly.We would definitely stay there again.

The location affords one a relatively peaceful night's rest and combined with the pretty view from the balcony over the small garden opposite, all in all, this one of our best stop overs. The area (Latin Quarter) is very lively with plenty of reasonably priced restaurants close by.The rooms were medium sized, well serviced and still retained their original Parisien charm.Reception was friendly and efficient. Continental breakfast was served in our room at a price you couldn't refuse... and the coffee was good!Secure parking was available close by.We will definitely visit again.

The only thing missing was a coffee pot (we bought a French Press and it solved the issue)...The room was kept very clean..and we mostly had breakfast brought to our room which was juice, coffee, and pastry or bread..it was plenty for us..we aren't big morning eaters.The area was quiet, and we really had nothing to complain about.

<Content>Small and friendly THis place is very well located to access the latin Quarter of Paris and is conveniently close for a short walk to Notre Dame and on to the Louvre and Toulieres Gardens. It is essentially a charming 6 storey town house with two rooms on each floor. I had a Superior room which was most satisfactory. Bedroom, lounge[ette], kitchenette and bathroom. Decor was pleasant and in good order., and not ,thankfully, matching pattern everywhere !The breakfast was adequate although I would suggest you bought your own croissant ,confiture ,coffee etc from one of the many food shops nearby and made your own in your kitchenette- the Salon for breakfast, although clean tidy and OK is in the basement and a bit ...lonely. The chap on the front desk was most helpful and courteous in his manner. One felt inclined to rebook here if wishing to be this side of the river.

<Content>satisfactory experience Location was good, in a cul-de-sac off Rue des Ecoles so little traffic noise. Walk to the Pantheon and Boulevards St Germain and St Michel. Room had kitchenette facilities that we did not use.The safe was tricky so we didn't use that either.Note there was no A/C but there was a fan.We did not eat breakfast at the hotel.Overall acceptable accommodation.

<Content>Excellent The Hotel Residence Henri IV is not to be mistaken for the other Henri IV, which is located at the upper end of Rue St. Jacques, some 500 meters to the north, and which is part of the rather americanized 脦le St. Louis Imperium, so to speak. The Residence Henri IV is a very small hotel, located at the Rue des Bernardins. It has only 12 rooms, two on each of the six floors. The higher, the better, but only because of the light and the view. I was lucky. I had room 62, 6th floor, which was excellent. Unusually large for Parisian standards, two small balconies, two large french windows, large bathroom, small kitchen with fridge and microwave. Very well appointed room. A view from the windows over the rooftops eastward, towards the Institut du Monde Arabe. The personnel at the reception is very nice. There is a simple breakfast (鈧?6), which I didn鈥檛 use. I stayed here from august 29 till september 2, partly on a reduced tariff, and paid 鈧?100 for the first three nights, and 鈧?195 for the last night, in september. The normal room rate was given as 鈧?195, which I wouldn't be able to pay if I would stay, as I normally do, for a week. The best thing about the hotel is indeed its great location. The hotel is on the dead end part of the Rue des Bernardins, just off the Rue des Ecoles. Pantheon 5 minutes walk (uphill), Seine 10 minutes (downhill). Notre Dame and Sorbonne in easy walking distance. Metro Maubert at 200 meters, line number 10, Austerlitz- Auteuil. Only disadvantage: you will probably always have to change lines, if you really want to go anywhere. The quarter around the hotel is very village-like, the more so as it is in fact situated on a small hill (Montagne St. Genevieve), and it is much more pleasant than the area around St. Jacques, which is heavily tourist-infested. It has a lot of normal shops, a small market near by 鈥?also at place Maubert - and small restaurants, where Parisians themselves are very present. The neighbourhood is of course the Ouartier Latin and students are everywhere. If you can get this hotel for 鈧?100, (like I did in august) it is a real bargain. 195 seems to me to expensive.

<Content>Most enjoyable We stayed for just two nights with our daughter in a two roomed suite.The decor was spectacular and the whole building was what one expect to see in Paris. The location is ideal for sightseeing and the staff are very efficient and friendly.

<Content>Peaceful and central We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend and weren't disappointed at all.The great thing is the location. It is in central Paris but not in the typical tourist traps, rather in an area where Parisians live. At Place Maubert (1 or 2 minutes' walk) there was an open-air market with the finest food you can imagine: fresh fish, sea food, vegetables, fruits, cheeses, flowers. It made us want to move to the area! Better still, it wasn't touristy, this was where normal people went to buy their produce. We also had our breakfast at one of the bistros here after reading the comments on the breakfast at the hotel at Tripadvisor. (So we can't comment on the hotel breakfast.)A few steps away from the market: the Seine and Notre Dame etc. Everything you want!We had two rooms, numbers 10 and 20. (With hindsight, we could have had a larger apartment to save money, we paid 160 鈧?a night.) Room 10 is a bit dark (1st floor) whereas room 20, being higher up, was lighter. We had small kitchenettes with microwave, fridge, stove (with crockery but no wine glasses). One fridge didn't work and was defrosting (water everywhere) but the staff were quickly and politely at hand to sort everything out. (This was the only time we needed the staff and they were really very helpful and friendly).The hotel is in a cul-de-sac and is very quiet. This is any advantage; we could sleep with the window open. However, the rooms are smaller than they seem on the website, but adequate all the same. The ceilings were full with stucco, the furniture was reproduction (not antiques) but tasteful. The wardrobes were a good size: they didn't fill the rooms! The staff did speak English. However, we tried to speak French (badly!). They took the time to listen and reply slowly in French, not falling into English to make things quicker. We would stay there again!

<Content>Very nice and comfortable hotel We were very impressed with the price/quality ration of this hotel. We booked one of the two room suites and felt it was very comfortable and definitely worth the money. The hotel is well maintained, has a good location and has very friendly and helpful staff. Definitely worth going back again!
