<Content>oooops....still Cool (not Barcelo Sants) 鈥淐ool!鈥?br/>Barcelo Sants gogirlie3 West CoastDec 2, 2008 I think it was booked thru travelocity or expedia. not sure - whoever american airlines uses. ANYWAY. Great little place away from tourist central but with a great view of the beach (across the blvd). We enjoyed it. The young women at reception were pleasant, helpful and attractive. The guys weren't helping the business much - terse, snobby, tired of their jobs. We even tried to butcher their language while communicating (oh, maybe that was it - our Catalan was so bad we might have accidently said something wrong - sorry, we tried, this was our first time). The restaurant was really great with excellent Ports and desserts. They were very friendly and understanding of our late hours coming in after a day of touring, hungry. the service was just right and added to our enjoyment. And we even got to take our pic with a Spanish futbal star who was staying there. would always go back. A little hard to find at first, but you can get there via the train from the airport(cheapest way -get a multiday pass) you'll just have a 5-10 minute walk from the nearest station. parts of the neighborhood look like they could be sketchy after dark. Like all cities-night wouldn't be the time to walk alone. Beds were comfortable and good sized. Room was very clean, housekeeping generally friendly and flexible, in-room safe, amenities were nice. There was a conference and we really didn't notice any noise from conference goer's partying. We would go back.

<Content>Great Hotel, fab beach location. Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and would def recommend it. Room wasn't ready for check in as we arrived well before recommended check in time of 3pm but we were told we could change and freshen up in the hotel gym, which is small but adequate. Location is 2 mins walk to the nearest beach and around 15 mins bus ride into the city centre. Got a great value delicious 3 course meal in the hotel restaurant. Buffet breakfast was also delicious and they had a yummy chocolate cake that you could help yourself to!

<Content>Nice Rooms, great view! This hotel was right across the street from a beach. It was about a 10-15 minute walk to Port Olympic, and about a 5 Euro cab ride to La Rambla. I loved the location! As for cleanliness, it was extremely clean, and the hotel decor was fresh and new. The staff were reasonably friendly and parking was available for 15 euros a night.

<Content>Good Hotel and perfect location It's a big hotel, very clean and nice, location wise is perfect, next to one of the best beaches [Marbella] in Barcelona [there are nice beach parties Weekend nights as well] and bus 41 takes you in 10-15 minutes to the Barcelona city center.it lacks character and a personal service if that's what you are after.

<Content>Fab hotel! We booked the hotel online a couple of weeks before we were due to travel and received email confirmation. However, when we arrived (at 11.00pm) they realised there was a mistake with the booking and had booked us in for August not July! and the hotel was fully booked! Nightmare! However they rang around for an alternative hotel for us for the night and took us to one literally around the corner which was a very nice 4* hotel with breakfast included. They got us into the Barcelo the following day. Because of the inconvenience they put us in a superior room on the 11th floor with a wonderful sea view. The reception also sent up water, strawberries and chocolates up by room service as an apology! Although they made a mistake with our booking they did enough to make the situation better and were very helpful. The room was lovely with a huge bed it was very clean. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is happy to be near the beach but about 20 mins from the centre by bus.

It is very modern, faces the Mediterranean, free internet cafe and close to a bus stop for easy access to the inner city.we had no problem whatsoever with the hotel, but it could have been a little better if the hotel was more in the city.

<Content>wonderful honeymoon getaway We went to barcelona for our honeymoon and stayed at this hotel because of the price and pictures. It is perfect for a honeymoon if you just want to get away. it was right across the street from a fairly quiet beach, minutes away from a small mall and right next door to a wonderful chinese restaurant. we wanted to do touristy things too, so we got a 5 day pass for the tourist bus lines which picks you up relatively close to the hotel. we got to see all of the amazing attractions of barcelona and just got a trip to town the days we didn't want to go site-seeing. it is 20-30 min from the airport but really not that far from the city center via bus. everyone in barcelona is so nice and helpful and so many people speak broken english. there is an amazing tapas bar and a wonderful sushi joint in the main plaza circle in town. everyday in barcelona was so awesome, especially since the hotel and its staff are just so nice. they were really accomodating. we initially had a room facing the city and switched to get one facing the ocean. the street is quiet and overall it was a grand experience.

<Content>Very nice but not in the city center The main reason to stay at Barcelo atenea mar hotel is to attend a 2 days conference which was held in this hotel. It is a very modern hotel facing the sea. I was given a great corner room in the 11th floor ( number 1113 )...It has a great great great view. To the left side is the beach and to the right side you can see the segrada famillia and the tower. Internet is free in the hotel and there are two laptops in the cyper cafe in the lobby.The staff are very friendly and speak good English.This hotel is not in the city center but there is a mall called Diagonal mar which is only 10 minutes walking from the hotel and it has everything you need and there are many restaurants and a big supermarket.The area is very safe and not isolated. If you want to go to Plaza catalonia in the city center take bus 41 and there is a bus stop just outside the hotel's door.Never think of taking Traveller cheques with you as they are not used in Barcelona and even can't be cashed in many banks....There is only one place called Interchange in La Rambla where you can cash them with a charge of 2.5%.

<Content>Pleasant place to lay your head We drove from Reus airport (100km away) had no idea how to find the hotel as the hotel website location details are dire. We finally arrived after driving around barcelona for an hour and stopping in a friendly beach side cafe for directions. Free underground car park is a plus for those driving.We booked this hotel specially because it was by the beach (was to cold to go there whilst we were there) and for the spa facilities - which never worked during our stay. Food in restaurant was lovely BUT they do not advertise nut content in food and being allergic to nuts I had a very nasty episode after having something with goats cheese that had walnuts inside it! We asked to restaurant to ensure that nuts were highlighed in future and they said they would - whether they do........? The air con was rubbish and we spent each night with the window open listening to ambulances etc. Other than that we liked the hotel and found the staff to be helpful - broken english spoken and we got by.We took the Turisitic bus (20 Euro per day each or 26Euros for 2 days) we did 2 days and found the trips to be excellent with headphones and an english spoken guide. There are three routes that interlink and you just hop on and off all day from 9am (ish) to about 8pm. We would have loved more time o plan to go back but peraps not to this hotel. it was nice and clean but basic - no drawers in which to store clothes and only 6 coat hangers between two of us - not ideal. Visit diagonal mar just a block away (on the green route on the bus) it has lots of shops and eateries to suit all tastes.

<Content>A great hotel We chose this hotel as it was a cheaper option than others more centrally located. Because it was a short walk to the metro, getting around Barcelona wasn't a problem. It was around a 20 minute walk to Port Olympic. We had an inexpensive cab ride to the airport.Nearby was a lovely park, a mall and the beach (it was a little cold to spend time on it however). The room wasn't huge, but very nicely decorated,stylish, comfortable and clean. We ate in the hotel's restaurant once, the food was great; I had the nicest cod I've ever eaten! I would really recommend this hotel as a base to explore Barcelona.

<Content>Good for beach, not too bad for city if you're willing to travel! I stayed at this hotel for one night at the end of a three night stay in Barcelona. For the first two nights we stayed in Hostal Goya near Placa Catalunya. The Atenea Mar is perfect for a beach holiday and good for those who want to mix the beach with the city - as long as you don't mind a bit of a travel back to the hotel after a days sightseeing. We caught a bus from Placa Catalunya to right by the hotel (bus no 41) which took about 20-25 minutes. The reception staff were nice and helpful, they got us a cab when we wanted to go out to the near by club catwalk and kept our bags for us when we checked out the next day. Its about a 10 minute walk from the Diagonal Mar shopping centre, where there are restaurants and shops - and 20 mins the other way is the Olympic Village (not much to see there we thought!) There's a spa in the basement (just near the car park) where theres a hot tub (which wasn't working too well), a sauna, steam room and gym - perfect for unwinding after a long day. All in all, a good hotel!

<Content>well, we liked it We have just returned from spending 4 nights in the Barcelo Atenea Mar in Barcelona, and in our opinion the hotel was top class. Barcelona itself, is out of this world, we loved it, and the hotel was certainly everything we needed.If you are looking for a bustling few days right in the middle of the city, then its probably not for you, but if like us, you're looking to spend some time in the hustle bustle of the city during the day and then something a bit more relaxing in the evening then dont hesitate to stay there.Its a short walk to the metro station and then only a few stops to Placa de Catalunya which directly leads to La Rambla.The hotel itself was spotlessly clean and all credit to the staff who, despite other reviews, we found to be entirely helpful and friendly, especially the female bartender who served us there on numerous occasions.I cant comment on the hotel restaurant because we didn't eat there, only because, if we had eaten in every place we wanted to then we would have spent our entire (short) holiday in eateries! The bar was modern without being uncomfortable and very reasonably priced.The hotel itself is about a half hour walk from the Olympic Port. Its a very pleasant walk along the front of the city with the beach to your right. Once you reach the port then you'll find it full to bursting with restaurants and bars with everything you could possibly want for filling your tummy......may I highly recommend the steaks, anywhere.Go on.... book your barca break, you'll love it.

<Content>A business-man's hotel We stayed at the Barcelo' Atenea Mar in Barcelona as a pre-trip hotel stay for a cruise that left from the port in Barcelona. This was one of the hotels that the cruise line had available. Even though there had been cruise-line families and guests checking in and out for several weeks, the hotel did not seem comfortable handling multiple check-ins needing multiple rooms per party.We arrived early afternoon and were able to secure one of the two rooms we had booked. The check-in person was as helpful as she could be considering it was prior to the scheudled check-in time and they had had many late check-outs. We had two rooms, but not adjoining. They were both on the first floor just above the reception area. The elevators are very small and barely accomodated 2 adults, 2 children and accompanying luggage (2 small, 1 med. and 2 large suitcases). To activate the electricity in the room, you have to put your key card into the slotted box on the wall as you enter. Even though the directions are on the folder that they put your key in, our check-in person did not point this out to us, so we had difficulty figuring out how to activate the lights. If it had been night-time, we would not have figured it out as the room is very dark with the curtains drawn (which makes it very nice for sleeping).The beds are very comfortable although not plush by any means. The carpeting was indoor - outdoor but was clean. There was plenty of storage space in the closet.The shower did not have a curtain but a half-glass so great care was needed for children showering and not flooding the tile floor.Our general assessment is that this a great hotel for a business man (or woman) to stay; it was not as well-suited for families or vacationers. However, it was conveniently located to the beach and also had two Bus Turistic' stops on the corner. It is a short walk to Diagonal Mar as well.

<Content>Perfect for the beach This is a great Hotel in Barcelona. The hotel is very close to a mall, Diagonal Mar Mall, close to the hop-on hop-off tour bus stop which takes you all over Barcelona for about 19 Euros, there are three lines Blue, Green and Red. The hotel is perfect for going to the beach, it is directly across the street, very close for walking. The beach across the street is very nice (topless), clean and has a little cafe. We have 2 children 8  4, they loved the beach and never once asked about the topless part, really not a big deal. The hotel is clean, rooms are nice size, comfortable bed, large bed. We had a roll a way bed brought in for our 8 year old and our 4 year old slept with us, plenty of room. The area of the hotel is quiet, clean and safe. If you are looking for hustle and bustle and lots of action, this hotel is not for you. It is easy to get to the hustle and bustle though. Not a lot of restaurants and cafes in the area. There is a restaurant in the hotel, a little pricey but convenient. Hope this is helpful. I would stay there again.

<Content>The Average Atenea Mar We stayed here for three days while we were in Barcelona. The rooms were small, but we were lucky enough to get 2 adjoining rooms for all four of us. The rooms were very cheery and posh, and seemed very futuristic as well. I also liked it that you have to put your room key into the slot in the entryway to activate the electricity. The hotel was in walking distance of a beach. Hotel employees were very nice, and fixed our issues with our room keys (it did take two times to get it fixed, though). They spoke excellent English.The beds were very nice, though since we got a second room floor (1st floor in European) that faced the street, we heard a lot of the street noise.Taking a shower was harder than I expected, as when I tried to turn up the heat on the shower, it either became too hot, or when I tried to make the water cool, it became too cool. (There was another person in our party taking a shower the same time as I was in the other room, which means that both showers must've been connected to one water source).The restaurant at the hotel for lunch was average: service, food, atmosphere, and so on. I do, however, recommend the hotel restaurant for their buffet breakfast. Very delicious, with different drinks, various meats, and breakfast foods. TV had 3 English Channels: CNN International, FOX News (yes, from America) and BBC World.

<Content>Close to beach - and subway! My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for three nights at the end of a 10 day holiday in Spain. Really enjoyed our visit - true the manner of the reception desk staff left something to be desired but apart from that we couldn't fault it. Room was big, spotlessly clean (including the bathroom). Sheets changed daily during our stay. Free web access in the hotel lobby near the bar. While it is certainly not in the centre of town the hotel is only a 10-15 minute walk to the Selva Del Mar subway station - very easy to find and the streets, though quiet, felt safe even late in the evenings. It is an area which seems to have seen a great deal of development recently - new apartments blocks and hotels and a nice little park not far away either. The diagonal mar shopping centre (10 mins walk) has some lovely restuarants (don't resort to Burger King there is no need) especially on the top level outdoor area. The beach is just across the road - and lovely for a walk.

At 13 euros it is a little pricey, but the convenience and selections were worth it. They do not change sheets every day. With the beach that could be a problem. When we removed the sheets from the beds they were changed. We would stay there again.

<Content>Good 4* Hotel overlooking the sea Stayed for just one night at the Atenea Mar at the end of April - business trip. This is good hotel, very clean, modern and bright. Room was a reasonable size overlooking the beach and the sea. Comfortable bed and an excellent bath and shower.The hotel has a cocktail bar with internet access and a gym. The two internet computers seemed to be continually in use by people attending a conference at the hotel. The evening meal in the restaurant was very good if a bit pricy. Breakfast (included in the price for me) was truely excellent, bacon and eggs - scrambled and fried - as well a very comprensive continental buffet.As all the other reviewers have pointed out - this hotel is not in the centre of Barcelona! It is, though, just across from the beach and Diagonal Mar (about 10 minutes walk) is enormous with all the shops you could want! Lots of restaurants as well - including a Burger King :-( Not many other restaurants in the area. To sum up: a good 4* hotel close to the beach but not in the centre of town.

<Content>Great Place To Stay Near The Mediterranean Ocean We stayed in this hotel the week before Thanksgiving, and we had a partial view of the ocean as well as the city. The room was very clean, as well as the bathroom, which is very important to us. The daily breakfast buffet was a lifesaver, with a variety of meats, cheeses, eggs, fruits, bread, cereal, pastries, the greatest coffee, cappucino, or expresso, or fresh juices, all for one price per person. The hotel was a twelve minute walk from the Selva De Mar subway station, which is the yellow line. If you take the blue airport bus in to town, get off at the Plaza Catalunya. When you get off the bus, go right down the street one block to the Urquinoya subway station underground. Take the yellow line (L-4) to Selva De Mar. Then walk down Selva De Mar Street towards the ocean to the hotel which is like 5 blocks away , but you will have to make a right turn on Passeig de Gracia and walk 3 more blocks to the hotel. Near a great shopping mall with a Burger King also. We had the best time, and would stay there again.

<Content>Good for Families visiting Barcelona area If you are looking for an affordable place to stay near Barcelona, this hotel is a good choice. We debated between staying here or within the city. This worked out for us because we had a rental car and plans to visit other parts of the area also. Couple of notes, if you plan on driving to and from Barcelona there is a 4.50 euro toll each way. The hotel is in a good location, parking was not a problem, and the breakfast was fine. It is around other buildings but still manages to be quiet. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, but we didn't find one that was good. Cafe de las Arts was good for dessert and coffee, but we never had a decent dinner and any of the restaurants (4 nights, each time a different restaurant!) You are near Tarragona, so it was worth the visit, the ruins were interesting. The room itself is not big, very clean, master bed was a bit small and flat. The couch is for one person (sheets provided) and the ottoman opens into another bed (which we figured out the 2nd night). Travelling with two teenagers, it was tight, but we were not in the room that much. The hotel itself was very clean and grounds were well kept. The security was also pretty good. Nice office area, with one computer that was available most times we needed it. Staff was nice and helpful with directions and info.

<Content>A Business Class Hotel but TERRIBLE LOCATION for Tourists The hotel is contemporary and the rooms are clean and well appointed. The hotel serves a very good buffet breakfast that is usually included with your room. But here is the problem. The hotel is no where near anything you wish to see in Barcelona. If you take the bus from the hotel to downtown Barcelona, be prepared for a 30 minute bus ride. What's more, this bus stops running at 10 pm. So you will have a lot of difficulty getting back to the hotel. We ended up having to take a cab back. It's extremely inconvenient because you can never return to your hotel to freshen up for dinner. Once your in the main area of Barcelona, your stuck there until you're ready to return to the hotel for the evening. DON'T LET YOUR TRAVEL AGENT BOOK YOU INTO THIS HOTEL, YOU WILL BE SORRY! We were mislead into believing it was in the city center. But its really in the suburbs. Its a great hotel for business people, but not a good choice for Barcelona tourists.

<Content>Good value, easy to get to location I spent a long weekend in Barcelona at the beginning of September. Our room had a seaview and despite the busy road out the front, you could not hear any traffic in the room. The room had a clean, huge bed, good choice of cable channels and a nice shower/bathroom. I've noticed some people have claimed the hotel is way out of town. I did not think so at all. The nearest metro station is Selva del Mar, which is about a 10 minute walk, no longer than that. From there its only a 10 minute ride to the centre of town - Las Ramblas and Cathedral area. Personally I wouldn't want to stay in absolute central Barcelona, with either tons of noise or your hotel is above a train station or something. As many have mentioned, there aren't many places to eat nearby, bar the shopping centre. However if you walk down the beach promenade into town direction for about 15 minutes, there's lots of places to eat overlooking the sea leading down to the Olympic port area. The beach opposite the hotel was really nice and the Diagonal Mar shopping centre is great for food and shopping, however breakfast is another matter. We spent ages going around the cafes and restaurents asking for food around 10am and they said they only served drinks at that time. As for attractions, we had a Gaudi day and saw Casa Batilo, Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera (Casa Mila). I didn't go inside Casa Batilo because I figured it was going to tell Gaudi's lifestory as did La Pedrera, but check it out from the street anyway. All of his stuff is amazing, especially the cathedral and the roof of La Pedrera. Also we did a day trip to the PortaAventura theme park. Was only a 90 min train ride from Sants or Passeig de Gracia train station. You can buy a combined rail/park entrance ticket at the station. It was a great theme park with lots of scary and mild rides. Had more to offer than some of the UK places like Thorpe Park and Chessington, which for me do have enough scary rides.

<Content>Great Modern Hotel I loved the hotel, the furnishings were very comtempory and the place is brand new. Its located about 20 -25 mins out of the town centre on bus 41, but directly across from the beach. So it depends on what kind of holiday you want - if its partying you're after then this is probably not the hotel for you. The bed is very comfortable here and staff, though a bit slow, are helpful. Shopping at Diagonal Mar is great, about 7mins walk, or if you're lazy catch the 41 bus, its the last stop. Oh, did i mention the view...very nice indeed.Do remember to buy the T-10 bus card, so you pay 0.63euros per journey instead of the single trips at 1.15euros. The Aerobus stops directly outside el cort ingles at placa catalunya and goes every 15mins on the hour.Barcelona is a fantastic place to go, and make sure you visit Sagrada Familia, although not completed - the architecture is simply amazing!

<Content>WOULDN'T RETURN The hotel is clean and modern however there have been a few things for which I wouldn't go back.POSITIVES:- clean rooms- modern hotel- big buffet breakfast- good price dealNEGATIVES:- slow staff and disengaged (they did not have the change my room/do not disturb signs and didn't provide alternatives, weren't that helpful in booking taxis)- dirty trays with dried up food sat outside in the hallways - my girlfriend had food poising, probably from the buffet breakfast- hotel was in the sticks, only way in town bus as taxis would take up to 1hr to come to the hotel! Moreover, not real alternatives for food, drinks, bars in the areaI loved Barcellona but if I went back I would choose a more central hotel with better customer service

<Content>Okay, but would not return My husband and I stayed at the BARCEL脫 ATENEA MAR three nights in early August and I must say I was not impressed- the room was very modern but very small, we did have a room on the 9th floor with an extraordinary view of the city, we were in four hotels during our stay in Spain and the staff here were the most disengaged and least friendly. Furthermore, dirty trays with dried up food sat outside in the hallways for days.I was a little worried about staying in the area because I read complaints about the area not having eateries: well we found a few on Paseo Taulat, one block from the hotel, I say try the coffee and Spain's famous tortilla in Cafe Taulat Number 136, and try the extraordinary wine in a little Bodega - number 138. The area is nice (though there is a lot of construction) and there is a bus half a block up, the number 41 that takes you to the center of town in about 20 minutes, and you do have the beach across the street!. I would defenitley go back and stay in the area but I will try another hotel.

<Content>For those who worry My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days prior to boarding a cruise. The hotel was clean as was the room. The staff didn't want to know you after checking in. Example: We were meeting with another couple. I kept checking in with the front desk to find out if the other couple had checked in. Worried because the hour was getting late, I went down to the front desk to ask if they had checked in. Was told no. About 1/2 hr later, our friends called. They had checked in shortly BEFORE we had checked in! Wanting to eat dinner, they called the front desk and were connected to our room. That's when we found out that they had safely arrived. Example: When I went to the front desk to find out if there was a soda machine around, the staff wouldn't look at me, just stood off to the side socializing. I found them rude. Our friends found their currency exchange inconsistent depending on which staff member you went to. They had a gym and jacuzzi in the basement - the jacuzzi wasn't running so was cold. I hated the breakfast - I like eggs for breakfast - eggs were cold. The dinner in the restaurant was ok. The hotel is located near the beach and is about 9 blocks from the subway. Not a bad walk for those out of shape. Felt relatively safe, even walking at night. Bus Touriste has a stop on the street. I would stay at the hotel down the street (Hesperia Del Mar), which we did stay at since Atenea didn't have openings for after our cruise. Hesperia Del Mar is friendlier, just as clean, better breakfast, cheaper, and same/better access to beach, bus touriste, and subway.

<Content>Pretty good deal Modern, simple hotel located right on the beachfront, a little bit far from the center, but a great location for strolling along the beach. The neighborhood of Poblenau offers a more quiet, less touristy neighborhood for dining.The Hotel room is quite large with an enormous bed. There is no internet in the rooms although the hotel lobby offers free internet access on their computers. The only complaint is that the clean up for the room service was slow. We ordered breakfast each morning and arrived late in the evenings with our trays still in the hallway.

<Content>A cut above We have just returned from 12 lovely nights in Barcelona staying at this hotel. It is in a great location, about 12 mins on metro from Las Ramblas, then maybe about a 7 mins walk from nearest metro (selva de mar) to the hotel. The room was great, comfiest bed ever, and the much needed aircon was a life saver. Bathroom massive. It is ideal if you are looking for more of a beach hol which we were. The beach is literally across the street and what a lovely beach it is. There are wee beach shacks all along selling food and drink and dj's every weekend til 3/4 in the am, lots of locals partying hard! We bought the multi-trip metro tickets and found these cheap and easy to use. There is a great shopping centre (Diagonal Mar) 5 mins from hotel,loads of eating places in the shopping centre too. There are about 4 chinese restaurants near the hotel, only one of which I would recommend. As you leave the hotel turn left and it is about 3 blocks down. Cheap as chips!!! Although they don't sell them!! The Chinese and Indian restaurants are defintely the cheapest in town.. Olympic Port is about a half hour walk away, down at the harbour, with loads of tavernas and pubs and a couple of discos. A couple of bars have bands in til 3am. But be warned take plenty cash cos it's not cheap there. If you're not prepared to walk back to hotel don't leave it too late to get a taxi, there's no chance after about 1.30 or 2am. We walked back a few times!! All in all I would say if you are going for a short trip then you would probably be better off nearer Las Ramblas but for a longer holiday it's a great hotel for access to the beach for lazy days and to the metro for sightseeing and shopping! Enjoy!

<Content>VERY GOOD HOTEL paid 拢46.50 per night room only for this four star hotel and was very happy for the four nights.room was great nice big bathroom with hairdryer.rooms 100% sound proof no sound from outside at all5 to 7 minutes walk to metro station selva del mar four stops to zoo five stops to barcelloneta station leaves you walking distance to port vell 5 minutes and ten to ramblas.the hotel has a bus stop outside the hotel were you can get bus number 41 direct to plaza cataluna (centre) takes 29minutes and stops 15 times but it is great for your final day to get the airbus service from the plaza cataluna to the airport.we left the hotel and got the number 41 at 7.25am and we managed to get to the airport on the airbus at 8.35 .this hotel is great value for money although you do have to use the transport services but still not a great problem as the bus and metro are near.i recommend the chinese restaurant outside the hotel (leaving the hotel to the right its on the corner restaurant xineu)the best i have had in long timethe hotel is walking distance from the diagonal mar shopping centre where you will find everythingturn left when leaving hotel and walk straight for 10-15 minutes you will see in the distance the iluminated diagonal mar sign on your left.do not go to the vila shopping centre in ciudalleta it is total crap diagonal mar is the bestenjoy and if you have further questins email me atthegibraltarian@fastmailfm

<Content>Fantastic hotel I was sure this hotel was a 5-star. The room was massive and stylish - the best I've ever stayed in. The restaurant has a great room. Waiters were great. Downsides: wired internet not connected in rooms - only a pay-per-usage wireless service which I couldn't get to work. We had an included dinner where they'd really skimped on the ingredients.

<Content>Perfectly OK Stayed in November 2004, room clean and modern, staff helpful and speak English. Good selection at breakfast buffet, restaurant menu limited however and although the food was good it seemed expensive in comparision to restaurants in Barcelona centre. Thought bar and mini bar prices were very expensive bearing in mind the cost in Spanish supermarkets. Was a little disappointed in room facilities am used to continental hotels having only one English speaking channel on TV (News) and we had hoped to be able to watch films as Expedia indicates all rooms have a VCR, not ours, neither did it have the hydromassage bath that Expedia also indicates all rooms have.As other reviews have pointed out hotel is a little out of the way but number 41 bus from just along the road takes you into the centre for 1.10 Euros. Tourist bus also stops there, 20 Euros pp for two days unlimited travel on this, we thought this was very good value.

<Content>Great stay, but a bit out of the way My husband and I just got back from 3 nights at the Atenea Mar, and overall, we were very happy with our choice. We paid 90E (+tax)/nt. and felt this was a good value for a nice hotel in Barcelona. The room was simple in a minimalistic, modern kind of way. The bathroom was large by even Western hotel standards - let alone European - the room was also larger than other European accomodations we have had in the past. We even had a fully stocked fridge/minibar - (although unfortunately we didn't realize this until the last night). The free Internet access and steam room, gym etc. were a nice plus too.On the downside - it is a bit of a walk to the Metro - about 7 minutes or so (although the bus to the center of town is just a block away), the staff is not particularly friendly (although they are helpful) and there are few places near the hotel to grab a quick meal. If you want a nice, comfortable room at a good price in a safe - although a bit removed location, this is the place. If you want the perfect location in the center of all the action, you may want to consider a different hotel.
