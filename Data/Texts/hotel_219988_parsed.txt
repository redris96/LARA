<Content>Highly recommendable Great location, near the pantheon and Saint-Germain des Pr茅s. Direct metro line to Gare du Nord. Very friendly, helpful staff. When we asked for restaurant recommendations, the lady at the reception came up with excellent suggestions. We stayed in a triple room, special Christmas offer. Breakfast included and served on bed each morning, without supplement. No negative remarks, except for the slow elevator maybe ;-). Next time we go to Paris, I wouldn't hesitate to stay in Les Grands Hommes again.

<Content>Had a great time at des Grands Hommes We stayed at the Grands Hommes for 3 nights in November and truly enjoyed our stay. Roman checked us in when we arrived. He was very welcoming, which was such a treat after the long red-eye trip from New York. Our room was very cute and very french, even though it was on the small side. We had a nice view of the Pantheon and the city. The location of the hotel was great for walking to various neighborhoods in Paris, given its central location. We would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>loved it, would stay again For our recent trip to Paris, we were extremely pleased with our experience at Hotel Des Grandes Hommes. From reservation to check-out, our experience with the front desk was easy, efficient, and pleasant. They were helpful with making and confirming reservations, and also with recommendations for local restaurants, bakeries, and useful french phrases. We took the RER B from CDG airport, walked just a few short blocks to the hotel, and found a small but elegant lobby (with plenty of seating). We were told that our room wouldn't be ready until 2pm. We anticipated this, so we used the spotless bathroom in the lobby to freshen up, stored our luggage in the lobby, and explored the city until around dinner time. We were upgraded to a Pantheon view-room (still standard room, though) and were impressed with the quality and cleanliness of the room (which had all of the basics- safe, tv, minibar, etc). And of course, there was the wonderful view of the Pantheon. Yes, the room was small, but there was enough room for all of our luggage. My only complaint about the room is that there wasn't enough light. It was fine for getting around, but it was almost impossible to read in bed unless you were right next to the little lights at near the headboard. Some additional ambient light would have been very useful. The bathrooms, however, were sparkling clean (and very bright, I might add). As someone who is pretty OCD-ish about things like that, I couldn't have been happier. The first night seemed very cold, until we realized that the thermostat was set to about 50 degrees F (we fixed that quickly). We took advantage of the free Wi-Fi in the rooms to confirm locations, restaurant hours, etc. We stored our daily goods from the markets in the small mini-fridge.I cannot comment on the breakfast, as it was not included in our package (we reserved a non-breakfast package off the website for a great deal), but there are plenty of boulangeries and cafes within a stone's throw of the hotel. Our favorite restaurant was very close to the hotel- Les Papilles on r. Gay-Lussac (reservations required)- a small restaurant with only one option for dinner, a daily changing 4 course menu for 31 euros. Our meal was sublime. I also recommend Marche Biologique on Sunday mornings (on Blvd Raspail near r. Sevres) for lots of eating goodies. Location was great- we walked as far as the Tuileries gardens/Louvre, but used the subway for when we were pressed for time or for when our legs were tired (to the Eiffel Tower- although on a nice day, this is also walkable [discosure- we are in our low 30s]). All in all, we had very high hopes for this hotel, based on the numerous positive reviews on this website, and it exceeded our expectations. For our next trip to Paris, we will definitely try and stay here again!

<Content>A perfect place to stay in Paris We spent two nights here, and had a wonderful time.The hotel overlooks the Pantheon, so is easy to find - about five minutes walk from Luxembourg RER station - 3 stops and 10 minutes from Gare du Nord.We had booked a superior room, which overlooked the square, and were upgraded to a delux room on the top floor (60). This was a small suite, with 4 french(!) windows onto a balcony whch had a view of Montmatre. It was beautifully furnished, with a proper bathroom. A downside was it was very cold during our stay, and the bathroom was colder than one would have liked. A curtain on this window would have helped.The staff were very pleasant and helpful.The breakfast room in the basement was very characterful, and the breakfast perfectly adequate.

<Content>Lovely and refined! We stayed at Hotel des Grands Hommes for our last night in Paris, and enjoyed the hotel. Everything is well-appointed and very clean. Our room had a wonderful view of the Pantheon, though it was pretty small.Front desk staff were very welcoming and friendly, which was appreciated. Location is a short walk from RER-B line (the one to Charles de Gaulle), which was nice.We would definitely consider returning and would recommend it. They are doing everything right!

<Content>Always feel at home at des Grands Hommes I've stayed at Hotel des Grands Hommes numerous times over the past two years and have never been dissapointed.The rooms are very well decorated and all have their own character and have every thing you'd expect (TV, safe, mini-bar, desk etc). The bathrooms are also especially nice. Most rooms are a good size and are bigger than average for the centre of Paris and have original features. The photographs on the website are truly representative if not under selling of the hotel.Hotel is always very clean and staff are always helpful and attentive and all speak very good english. I cannot comment on breakfast as I have never had it.The location of the hotel is in the heart of the 5th, Paris' nicest district, overlooking the Pantheon and within 5 minutes walking distance of Saint Michel and rue Mouffetard, both are areas renowned for good, reasonably priced food from almost anywhere in the world you could imagine.The rates for the hotel are very good on the website where exceptional last minute offers can be found.I visit Paris around once a month and I will defeinitely be back to the Hotel des Grands Hommes.

<Content>lives up to the reviews We just returned from a 4 night stay and can echo the positive reviews - the hotel is definitely a gem and lives up to the descriptions here.We paid more than the price listed on this tripadvisor page and as a result it is was the most I've paid for a hotel of this class, but considering the cost of hotels in Paris it wasn't unreasonable. As others have commented, the rooms are spotlessly clean and the staff are very nice and helpful. But the best part is the location - we were able to walk everywhere - as a result we were hardly ever in the hotel. It's incredibly easy to get to/from the airports on the RER - we came in from ORY (flew OpenSkies from NYC, a great airline!) and it took less than 30 minutes. I'll definitely call the HGH first the next time we go to Paris.

<Content>Lovely Boutique The hotel was charming and the service was exceptional. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was right next to the Pantheon and Paris University. So it might not be the best location for a first time visitor to Paris since it not actually that central, but if it is your second visit, you get to see another lovely side of Paris. It is lovely walk through the Luxemberg Gardens nearby.

<Content>loved Hotel Des Grands Hommes We have been to Paris many times and have never found a hotel we would say thay we would come back to. However, this all changed when we stayed at Hotel Des Grands Hommes. A beautiful boutique hotel, centrally located, rooms very individual and staff exceptional. Small but impressive reception area with the reception staff being always helpful and informative about Paris. Ask for a room overlooking the Phanteon, if possible. When we next visit Paris, we will definately be staying at this hotel.Imelda, Northern Ireland

<Content>Exceptional!!! We just have just arrived back from Paris yesterday and I wanted to immediately write a review about the Hotel des Grandes Hommes! The hotel's location is perfect, it is within walking distance of most of the major museums and tourist sights! Also it is just three blocks away from a Metro/RER station. The hotel is beautifully located directly across the street from the Pantheon and is surrounded by a safe area with great local restaurants. Most importantly the staff is amazing, in the months prior to my stay, they made all of my reservations for restaurants, set up my shuttle to and from the airport, and set up and recommended excellent tours. In particular, Romain, was an great help. They are friendly, knowledgeable and professional. In addition, they make you feel at home. The hotel is spotless clean and the breakfast in the morning was just perfect. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who visits Paris! You will not be disappointed!

<Content>Deserves its good rating We鈥檝e been at the Hotel des Grands Hommes for a weekend recently and enjoyed it from beginning to the end. Location is, as many others have pointed out, excellent. Right at the Pantheon, a short walk from the RER Louxembourg station (make sure you don鈥檛 get off the station at the exit 鈥淩ue de l鈥橝bb茅 de l鈥橢p茅e鈥? it might be a bit confusing). The Staff were very friendly and helpful, breakfast was very good and served in the small cellar (cozy). The standard room was small but absolutely sufficient and nicely decorated; very nice bathroom, well equipped. There was also a balcony to the rear. Because the Sorbonne is nearby, there are many students around at that time of the year which makes the area very lively, also at night. Noise was no problem, though you could hear from the distance some people having a good time. The HGH is a definitive recommendation and a place to return to.

<Content>Great Hotel, Staff and Location Wow - per all reviewers, the location is fantastic with a view of the impressive Pantheon. We were upgraded to a superior room with a view and while I can't comment on comparisons for other Paris hotels, we were very comfortable (2 big pieces of luggage) with a good size bathroom and shower. Even though the Pantheon square sometimes was busy with traffic, the room was insulated well enough where we hardly noticed any noise, so we slept very well. The wireless internet connection in our room came in very handy.We were greeted by a very friendly receptionist (merci beaucoup Farrah - you are wonderful) who spoke good English and helped us with directions around Paris. All the people who worked at the hotel around the clock were friendly and courteous and our room was nicely cleaned and sheets changed every day.We did try their breakfast the first morning and there was a great selection of fruit, cheeses, croissants, jellies, and some cured meats. Coffee was great, though I dont think you will find bad coffee anywhere in Paris!Some observations on the neighbourhood: Plenty of cafes selling great sandwiches to go (handy for a quick lunch), a BNP Paribas with ATMs,  pharmacy all on Rue Soufflot. There are also small supermarkets in the area where we bought fruit  juice for our on-the-go exploration of Paris. We ate a couple of times at the Comptoir restaurant and the food was decent - good portions for the price (watchout, the salads are humungous and will easily feed two). We were dissappointed with the crepes at Crepes A-Go-Go which were way too sweet for our taste for breakfast. Having the Luxembourg RER station located at a convenient walking distance was a plus and that's how we travelled to/from CDG as well as to/from Versailles. Of course, don't miss a visit to the Pantheon; the tour to the upper levels of the Pantheon is well worth it. And close by, Rue Mouffetard is also a fun street to explore. There was also a small church on a street north of the Pantheon square that was holding classical music concerts which we discovered by accident - it was a delightful treat. Not to be missed sights like Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle and the Seine are all within comfortable, enjoyable walking distance.Paris is an awesome city to explore and we ran into very friendly, nice Parisians. This was our first trip and definitely wont be the last and yes, we would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel and location I stayed here for three nights at the start of a french holiday and taking the opportunity to visit friends in Paris. I had originally booked it as it was near where the friends lived, although they moved the weekend before I got there! However the location is quiet, parisien, just the right level of touristy, a stones throw from the lovelt luxembourg gardens and on the direct metro line from gare du nord for the eurostar.The picture 'room' by aj1809 is identical to my room, and all the pictures were very indicative of the hotel overall. The staff were helpful and understood my rusty french. The lift is slow particularly when the cleaners use it in the morning but the stairs down are fine not massive. The room was clean, the TV had a small mixture of channels including BBC world. I can't remember if I specifically booked a bath but there was and it was good to rest my aching feet. I would definetly stay here again except for the fact that my mantra is try somewhere different but I think I will struggle for the price. I may try to look at the other hotels in the rive gauche hotel group

<Content>Good option! My girlfriend and I stayed there for 1 night. The room was small but very nice and comfortable. It was very clean and tidy and so was the bathroom, which was of a decent size as well. The only problem we had was that upon arrival, our room was not ready, even though we arrived at 2pm and the check in time was scheduled at 1pm. Maybe the fact that we are young gave the lady in the reception reason to believe she could make us wait forever. She kept chatting with another lady but didn't look keen in sorting our room out. However, a guy came to the reception about 10min afterwards and he organized our room within 5min of us asking him. Other than that, the location is pretty good. Walking distance to many attractions.

This is a very classy place in a lively university location, and gets high marks for comfort. Not cheap but we have paid much more for much less less in Paris. No negatives at all except for VERY slow elevator (but the stairs work just fine!). We have found other hotels we like in Paris, but this will be our first choice for our next trip.

<Content>Wish we could afford to go back. We stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes almost 2 years ago now, and investigated the possibility of returning when we visit Paris again next year, however, the prices have gone up quite a lot and given the Aussie dollar against the Euro, it's now out of our price range. However, when we stayed there, we were thrilled with the hotel. The room (standard double) was minute, but as it was so beautifully decorated, the size didn't bother us at all. The bathroom was fabulous. Breakfast was included in the price and it was simple but delicious although it was served in a room so small that one could easily feel claustrophobic. Location was great, rooms were very clean and it was pretty quiet at night. Fabulous hotel. If the Aussie dollar ever improves, we will definitely return.

<Content>An enjoyable stay We had a short stay in the Hotel des Grands Hommes (2 nights), but it was enough to know that finally we have found in Paris a good, clean, quiet hotel, situated in an ideal location. The area itself is not so quiet during the day, but the at night time it is. Arriving to Paris from Brussels by train, it is very easy to take the RER line to Luxembourg station, the closest one to the hotel. We felt privileged to have a room with a view to the Pantheon. The staff were friendly and attended to all our requests for assistance. The area is full of small brasseries and it was very pleasant to walk to the Jardins de Luxembourg. We will definitely return and have no hesitation in recommending it.

Our room was lovely and a good size, and the hotel staff were always friendly and helpful. We were just a couple of minutes walk from Notre Dame and there were plenty of lovely restaurants close by. However, it was about a 40/50 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe, so pack you walking shoes. We didn't mind the walk, as we had lovely weather and you could always take a trip along the Siene to get there. We will definitely stay here again.

The view from one of the rooms was the majestic Pantheon - lovely to sit on the balcony of an evening enjoying a glass of red wine.Location is perfect - a short walk to Notre Dame and 5 mins to the metro station.I certainly intend to return to this hotel!

<Content>Hotel des GH is a winner! We stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of it! The location is great, with a birds eye view of the Pantheon right outside our window (you could practically touch it). There are plenty of cafe's and shops nearby for a quick bite to eat after a long day of sightseeing. If you want to venture out , St. Germaine de Pres is also within walking distance, with even more cafe's and great shopping. The hotel's service was impeccable- especially the woman who worked the day shift during our stay (unfortunately, we can't recall her name). She helped us with numerous touristy questions and she was always very friendly and easy to talk with. The rest of the staff was also extremely helpful and friendly (which wasn't our experience with other hotels in France). The room decor was beautiful and well maintained. Although a bit small (which isn't a surprise), the room was very comfortable (with a true queen bed, not two beds put together which is normal by most European standards). And again, the view of the Pantheon....fantastic! We would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. As someone who uses Trip Advisor for hotel feedback, I'm happy to say that the previous visitor's comments were right in line with our experience.

<Content>Affordable luxury (and friendly too) I spent hours and hours looking for a hotel on this site and on fodors blogs, etc. This hotel has the best, warmest reviews of any -- and for good reason. It's gorgeous!!! It's small and intimate and boutiquey.The front desk is SO friendly and helpful. And it worked for my mother, who is 80, and for my teenage son. Our rooms were SO French and SO beautiful. The bathrooms were lovely, the reading lights worked. All the details, big and small, were perfect.The location is fabulous, for buses, metro or taxis. The square is elegant and the view of the Pantheon is breathtaking, and I especially liked the chance to see it all sorts of light. ANd we got a terrific price on the Web.I can't say enough. My mother said she has been telling all her friends about how lovely it was, and she has stayed at many nice hotels in her 80 years.

<Content>Great Experience My husband and I went with my in-laws and had a great time. The hotel staff was very nice and considerate, and had great recommendations for dinners. So helpful with booking taxis, getting us to bus stops and the metro. Would highly recommend staying here. The location seemed great to me as well. This was my first stay in Paris, but we were only a few blocks from Notre Dame, the Metro and Luxembourg Park. Quiet area too.The room was a bit small (as I was warned) but very clean, and nicely decorated. The air conditioning worked well too!!!Just a side note: I was told people in Paris could be very rude to travelers (specifically Americans) and I found that to be COMPLETELY untrue. I've never met nicer people in a city!

<Content>Great value at the Grands Hommes This is a delighftul boutique hotel in a terrific location.My stay was for 3 nights in August.I found that I was able to walk to almost all of the places I wanted to visit, and barely used the metro pass that I had bought at all.The RER connection to the airport from the Luxembourg station makes for a straightforward transfer.The room was compact in size but with the stylish decor and the benefit of a high ceiling with its exposed beams the overall effect was elegant, and the bathroom was generously proportioned.Everything seemed spotless and well-maintained, and the staff possess the hallmark of a well-run hotel by taking pride in their work and appearing genuinely interested in providing an enhanced level of service.The price:value ratio exceeded my expectations, having booked through the hotel's website.My room was at the rear of the hotel and was very quiet at night.I only took the breakfast buffet one morning; I felt that it was fair value for the range and quality of what was being offered; for those prepared to wander further afield there's a fantastic organic bakery at the northern end of the Rue Monge which is 'vaut le detour'.This was the first time that I had stayed on the Left Bank, and the Grands Hommes has changed my mind completely about where I should stay in the future; I look forward to staying there again the next time that I am in Paris.

<Content>What a fabulous find! After spending an eternity on the internet finding a suitable hotel with rooms having an extra bed for our 5 year old son we ended up staying at the Hotel Grands Hommes. What an absolute delight! We booked through the hotel`s website and saved a fortune. The full price should have been 999 euros for a triple room for 3 nights but we ended up paying 550 euros. We stayed in Room 22 (good size for a triple room in Paris) overlooking the Pantheon - wow what a view!We loved everything about this hotel including the staff, cleanliness, location and top quality interior design and decor. Everywhere was beautifully furnished (more like 4 star) and the beds were very comfortable. The location is fantastic with lots of cafes and restaurants all around. It is easy to arrive by train from CDG Airport and just around the corner from Luxembourg Metro - great location for all the major sights.We felt the breakfast was a little steep for our 5 year old at 12 euros so used the two nearest cafes on Rue du Pantheon - great crepes. This hotel was lovely to return to at the end of tiring days sightseeing - a real haven of tranquility. We will certainly be returning to the hotel when we next visit Paris. It would be difficult to find such a great hotel with so much charm in such a brilliant location.

<Content>J'aime hotel des Grands Hommes! I have stayed at Hotel des Grands Hommes for two trips to Paris in the past couple of years. It was great both times. It's excellently located, very well appointed, and the staff is fantastic.I also stayed at their sister hotels, Hotel Ferrandi and Hotel Sorbonne, both these stays were also great experiences. Although Hotel Sorbonne was not as well appointed (perhaps they haven't finished renovating to the 5th floor, because all looked great except the room - which was fine, just not as lovely as at HdGH or HF), it too was still an above average stay I'd happily repeat anytime.thanks for all the very pleasant stays-David Flory

<Content>Charming hotel The hotel is charmingly cozy with a very friendly, helpful staff. The location is great, just steps away from the Latin Quarter and the beautiful Luxembourg Gardens. We loved the plentiful, scrumptious buffet breakfast which we were thrilled to have included in the room rate. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel to our travelling friends!

<Content>Fantastic! We just spent nine glorious days at the Hotel des Grands Hommes. The rooms are well appointed, and our fifth floor room had a lovely balcony looking out over the nearby Pantheon. The service was impeccable--professional, attentive, gracious, and congenial. The staff made excellent restaurant recommendations for us as well. The location couldn't be better--two blocks from the RER Luxembourg station (across the street from the Luxembourg Gardens), which goes direclty to both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports. It's also a five-minute walk to the Place de la Contrascarpe, a beautiful area with cafes, restaurants, and shops. We ate in that area each morning instead of the 12-Euro breakfast in the hotel (which isn't bad). I wouldn't stay anywhere else but this place. I can't wait for our next visit.

<Content>Great People, Great Location I found this hotel through Tripadvisor and was extremely happy with it. Booking through the website was simple and communication was prompt, courteous and clear. I was pleased with the price quoted. My daughter and I stayed here for a couple of days during our trip to Paris. The first thing that strikes you is the location - right next door to the Pantheon, in the heart of the Latin Quarter and within walking distance from Notre Dame. Upon entering the hotel, the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the quaint and intimate hotel lobby was truly welcoming. Free wifi connection was an excellent benefit and everything in the room was just great. Our room overlooked the square around the Pantheon which is quiet throughout the day and night. We didn't use their breakfast facilities because there are so many pretty street cafes which demanded our attention. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a welcoming, reasonably priced, intimate hotel in the heart of Paris. We'll certainly stay another time.

<Content>Hard to imagine a better hotel in Paris for the money! I spent months deciding on the best hotel for my honeymoon and first visit to Paris. I reserved other rooms, but still wasn't satisfied and kept looking, until I found Hotel des Grands Hommes. This hotel is everything I was looking for! It is located in the 5th Arrondisement, Latin Quarter, directly adjacent to the Pantheon. When you look down the street, you can see the Eiffel Tower in the distance. It is across from Luxembourg Gardens, which are a lovely place for a picnic. The RER stop from the airport is (Line B) is right there, so we didn' t need a cab. It's walking distance from the trendy Place St. Michael which is full of restraunts that are open late, and close to Notre Dame.This hotel is also in the low to moderate price range I was seeking, but without giving up the charm and comforts. I was worried a hotel like this didn't exist in Paris, but I finally found it and highly recommend it. The service was great. Our French is terrible, but everyone at the front desk spoke excellent English and was very friendly. They upgraded our room to a superior free of charge because it was our honeymoon. That was a great suprise! They also ordered our cab for transport to Orly airport to leave, since the RER doesn't go directly there, just to CDG.The room was so lovely and charming, just like in the pictures! It had an amazing view of the Pantheon through a big view window. The walls were covered in lovely wall paper and the high ceiling had exposed beams and crown moulding. The bed had drapery on the wall behind it, beautiful bedding, and was very comfortable with lots of pillows. Everything looked new and was spotlessly clean. The large bathroom had a bidet and towel warmer, and a fancy enclosed shower. The a/c worked great, and I didn't hear anyone in neighboring rooms once.The breakfast was fine, but I recommend eating in one of the many local cafes or the craperie on that street. It's also fun to visit the nearby outdoor market Moufetard and take a picnic to Luxembourg. The breakfast room, like all the common areas in this hotel was nice.The only drawbacks to this hotel, and pretty much any hotel in Europe, was that the elevator was small and slow (but at least they had one). It also is a bit of a walk to the nearest metro stop, but it still only takes 10-15 minutes and we didn't mind at all, especially for the quality of the room.

<Content>Look no further for Left Bank / Latin Quarter Super clean and great sized room. We had room#1 and it was large with a bathtub and shower. Toilet separate. TV reception was poor but we never reported it nor cared. Was fine for a quick CNN fix.Air conditioner was perfect and if anything...got too cold when maxed out. We had to adjust it. Perfect.They were rewaxing the floors, painting the exterior and doing many little maintenance jobs. The property is very well cared for.Location was great and very near RER and Metro.Everyone was very helpful and pleasant and there was always someone around to answer questions.There are many places to get great food in the AM so we didnt try the breakfast and they never even mentioned it to us.Lastly for North American visitors. The hotel uses European sockets and they do not have converters to US. You can use a US razor in the bathroom ok, but if you want to plug in your laptop and take advantage of the great and free high speed connection supplied by the hotel, you will need to supply your own converter. Eventually I found one in a store after a small search but I recommend you bring your own from home! Internet tip: during my stay the hotel next door which they also own, had a much quicker wireless connection so try both.This hotel CARES and deserves to be well rated.

<Content>Excelland location, very nice staff!! My daughter( 12 yr old) and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights only, July 27-30 . We had been travelling around Europe for almost a month, and this was a third hotel stay in Paris this trip.( long story) I have also been lucky enought to stay in about 1/2 dozen other hotels in Paris. All found on tripadvisor, and booked directly with hotels. For the price I paid, this was a gem. The staff were so nice, I mean really nice. The waitress in the breakfast room was so sweet and smiley, we ended up chatting,, and this is not easy to do in Paris, where most Parisians have a natural reserve. The front desk staff were so kind to my daughter as she practiced her french on them. The room was small, no doubt about it, but it was very clean and cute. We had also been able to book at an amazing price, 118 euros, which included breakfast daily, so no, we didn't get a  view room LOL but were happy with what we got. The location is truly excellant, close to metro , RER , and walking distance to many sites. I love the fact the street is quiet , but only 2 short blocks from bustling Boulevard St Michel, and only 1/2 block to a great cafe ( we ate there twice) .Book ahead to get a good rate, as I said rooms are small, even the more expensive ones, ( I peeked) ,, but when you are paying what we paid you feel pretty lucky to be at such a nice well located place!

<Content>Classy and comfortable in the best part of Paris. We have just returrned from a European trip and the stay in Paris was the highlight made more memorable by the excellence of the Hotel Grand Hommes which exceeded our expectations in all respects apart from room size. The Hotel is ideally positioned in the Latin Quarter opposite teh Pantheon and within walking distance of countless restaurants, the River and public transport.The rooms while small are spotlessly clean, with top quality bedding and classy decor and the staff exceptionally courteous and accommodating.I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to fellow travellers and will look no further for accommodation in Paris when I visit again.

<Content>Great place, very helpful staff Very clean and comfortable hotel. We were with our two teenage kids and booked two rooms and the hotel accomodated all our requests. The rooms were next to each other and they had one of the two rooms ready for us at 9 o'clock in the morning (as requested) even though the check in time is much later. Since we flew in from New York and arrived early in the morning, this allowed us to quickly wash up, freshen up and hit Paris by 10am that morning.The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful - helped us with all our questions and arranged for taxicabs as well.One negative : breakfast should be included in the room price. Breakfast is an extra 12 euros per person which means 48 euros for our family of four. Somehow paying $80 just for breakfast did not make any sense to us.

<Content>Good little Paris Hotel Room was small, but that is Paris typical. Very clean, entire hotel kept in great condition. Hotel staff always hospitable and helpful. They do hold bags for you free of charge in a small back closet for the whole day if you wish. Elevator is VERY small and creaky - we preferred to climb the stairs. The hotel is six floors high, and we unfortunately were on the very top floor. It gets very hot up there during the summer, but the rooms do have air conditioning. Metro/RER station (luxembourg) is close by (5 to 10 minute walk). About 20 minute walk or so to Notre Dame. Safe area, no fear walking around late in the evening, even after midnight (which we did). Would stay again.

<Content>Liked the Hotel des Grands Hommes We stayed at this charming small hotel over the Bastille Day weekend. We liked the atmosphere from the moment we entered the stylish lobby and got the slow but quiet lift up to the 5th floor.We recommend front facing rooms on the top two floors for the view over the square to the Pantheon and because the square can be quite noisy. Our room was a small double, beautifully decorated and with a very comfortable canopied bed. It was well equipped with large room safe and fridge, and a moderately sized ensuite.The attitude of the staff was excellent throughout although service in the basement dining room at breakfast was a little sloppy at times. Occasionally we found the lift mysteriously stalled on the service floor for long periods.Not cheap but well situated, clean and efficient.

<Content>Great Stay at Hotel Grand Hommes This hotel was perfectly situated 5 minute walk from the luxembourg train station. We took the train from Charles de Gaulle to the hotel with no problems at all. The hotel reception was very friendly when we arrived. Our room was beautifully appointed, a very comfortable bed and large size bathroom. The room itself was on the smaller side, but still very comfortable and clean. The hotel is right beside the pantheon and was about a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame, 5 mins to the Luxemborg Gardens. You can also see a view of the Eiffel tower around the corner from the hotel. There are many cafes and restaurants close by. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel des Grand Hommes and would definetely return and recommend. We had a good rate by booking via the hotel website, although you should be aware of the cancellation policy.

<Content>Most pleasant stay We decided very spontanously to stop over in Paris, coming from Brittany. We were lucky to get the last room available and managed to discuss the price a bit. The lobby is small as apparently most of the rooms are. But it does not matter because its very consequently furnished, let s say a neo-pompeian-empire of the late 20th century, therefore very cosy, very clean and well equipped. Everything, fabrics, doorhandles, towles etc seemed to be of 1st class quality. The staff was very very friendly and helpful. We even had our dog with us and it was not a problem -. of course the dog must have a friendly nature.The location is excellent, at least for me as I lived around the corner many years ago. You can walk through the nice atmosphere of the left bank - everything there is in walking distance, from the Boulevard Montparnasse to the cosy area and nice shops of the area aorund St Sulpice and the typical Latin Quarter 麓, Notre Dame and Ille St Louis. Its not very loud, as the square is not a major traffic spot. I will go there again and can highly recommend it !

<Content>full of character Stayed there in July of 2004 (a very belated review).This hotel is only a 3-star, and harbor no illusions - it's a 3-star hotel. However, in terms of style and character, it has more than some of the better ranked properties we've stayed in Paris.We had the mansarde room with view of the Pantheon. The room, while small, is tastefully decorated and has a large balcony with a great view. This is really what made our stay special. Had we stayed in a different room, our review would not have been as positive, as the public and private areas of the hotel are quite small.

<Content>Perfect hotel, great location This was our first trip to Paris, so we were flying sort of blind (thanks Tripadvisor). I had been through briefly on business, so I knew we wanted to stay in the Latin quarter, but that was all. Hotel des Grands Hommes seemed to fit the bill, so we went for it. We couldn't have enjoyed it more. The hotel was top notch and the staff was extremely helpful - and spoke English. Fara (or maybe Sara?) at the front desk helped us with directions each day and arranged a dinner cruise. She even gave us free RER tickets to the airport when we mentioned we were going to take the train (apparently left there by another guest). Our room on the 5th floor (542) had no balcony, but we were lucky to have a large bathroom. The size and shape of the rooms vary quite a bit. I was a little nervous about the European air conditioning, but we had the control and it got cold if you wanted it to. We didn't eat in the hotel - too many nice places close by. Our routine included crepes for breakfast at the Crepe-a-go-go around the corner. The hotel is on the plaza of the Pantheon at the top of the hill overlooking the latin quarter. The Pantheon is worth a visit, but probably won't be the highlight of your trip. The location is perfect - a short stroll to Blvd. St. Gremain and all the latin quarter action, but removed enough that you're not kept up by the noise. There's so much to do in Paris, you won't spend much time in the hotel, but I couldn't ask for a better base to explore.

<Content>Loved this hotel experience We had a great stay at this intimate, friendly hotel. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and booked a deluxe room with a view of the Pantheon. Our room was superb, with a terrace and lots of space to relax. We loved the view across the rooftops of Paris. We were particuarly impressed with the friendliness of all the staff and with the tremendous standard of housekeeping. We had breakfast in the tiny hotel breakfast room on two occasions and enjoyed the experience but we also found a great cafe on the small street directly behind the hotel which served breakfast coffee and croissants and was definitely a better budget option. The location of the hotel really is great - just a few minutes walk from Notre Dame and the Seine, but away from the bustle. We enjoyed exploring the quieter lanes and squares of the Latin Quarter. There were any number of metro stations within 5-10 minutes walk which allowed us easy access to other parts of the city. Although the Place Du Pantheon is relatively quiet at night we were woken up a few times, especially at the weekend. Rooms overlooking the hotel courtyard are likely to be quieter.

<Content>A lovely hotel on the Left Bank The Hotel des Grands Hommes is a small hotel on a quiet street right across from the Pantheon. The rooms are lovely, very clean, furnished with antiques, immaculate bathrooms. The service is excellent. One evening a light bulb blew out and shattered on our bedside table. My husband let the desk know, and within minutes someone came up to replace our light and to clean up. On another occasion the front desk helped us find a hotel in Provence for later on on our trip. The breakfasts are plentiful and delicious served in a small dining room downstairs from the front desk.The only complaint is that there were not enough drawers (at least in our room) to put away unpacked clothes. There was a closet, but a few drawers in addition would have allowed us to unpack more completely.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay I stayed at Hotel des Grands Hommes for a week in late June. The rooms were reasonably sized (for Paris), and in good condition. The style of the decor is from another century, which was not to my taste (though it was well done). The staff were courteous and helpful when responding to a request to change rooms. The second room had a balcony facing into the small interior courtyard, which was very nice.The hotel is in the Place du Pantheon, close to the RER B line (which goes straight to Charles de Gaulle airport), and Luxembourg garden.I would recommend the hotel without reservation to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, tasteful place, but doesn't need a luxury hotel experience (i.e. lots of staff, and overpriced service charges for everything).

<Content>great hotel, great location This hotel is in a great location and is literally next door to the Pantheon! The first day we walked to all of the major sites; second day we were a bit tired so we took the metro that is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The metro is very easy to use, but keep in mind that is stops running around midnight. The room was very clean and a good size, with a comfortable bed that slept two. The bathroom was surprisingly huge! The reception was very helpful and gave us excellent directions and advice. THe hotel is near many cafes and a couple souvenier shops. My friend and I (women in late 20s) felt safe walking around this area at night. I would recommend this hotel and would definitely return myself.

<Content>Perfect hotel! Great location! Terrific staff! Highly Recommend! This is our second stay at this location and, once again, found it to be perfect for our needs. Booked through the hotel's website which offers various discount specials depending on the time of year you will be visiting. Greatly appreciated the parking garage down the block, as we typically drive into the country (we live in The Netherlands).The rooms are Parision cozy, however nicely appointed with toile fabric, antique furniture and spacious bathrooms. Great French' feel and extremely clean! I would recommend to the hotel that a mattress topper or new quality mattresses be considered to make the beds more comfortable. They feel worn out and we felt the same on our previous visit. Would make the stay MUCH better, as a good night's sleep is important on holiday. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and were patient with my blossoming French! A terrific recommendation was made for dinner one night, that we probably would not have experienced had we searched on our own (Marie Verte on Pontoise). Love being next to The Pantheon, as well. Be prepared to walk a bit to reach various sites, however walking to The Notre Dame and picking up one of the hop-on-hop-off busses or a cab is definitely doable.We took breakfast in the hotel and found it quite sufficient--terrific table service (the waitress is simply lovely!) and a nice selection of foods to choose from--fresh breads  croissants, cereals, cold cuts and cheese, fruit and yoghurt, juices, coffee and tea and an option to take omelettes, if you desire. Convenient, as well.Although we have not experienced the other properties in this hotel group, we will definitely consider them if we elect to stay in other parts of the city in the future. It is quite evident that the managers and staff are concerned about their guests and how they enjoy their stay. Their commitment to excellent customer service is greatly appreciated. We have found our hotel of choice when we visit Paris.

<Content>Gorgeous hotel Next to the Awe Inspiring Pantheon My wife and I stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes on our first trip to Europe together. We couldn't have been happier. First, the service was exemplary. Everyone spoke English and really went out of their way to satisfy, including making dinner and taxi reservations to providing directions to local attractions. We booked a superior room which was guaranteed a Pantheon view but were upgraded for free to a top level balcony room with a table and chairs outside overlooking the pantheon. The awe inspiring view was the highlight of our trip. You could see the Pantheon, the top of Notre Dame and even Sacre Coeur in the distance on top of the hill. The room was luxurious with a large, clean bathroom with a full tub. Of course, the room was immaculately clean. We will never forget our stay. Thank you so much.

<Content>First rate Last stayed (in fact next door, at the Pantheon), some five years ago and the same excellent service, decor and attention to detail continue. The location is ideal for getting to everywhere you want to be, and the comfortable rooms a real pleasure to get back to after a long day. Will not hesitate to stay again and will recommend to others.

<Content>I loved this hotel ! I realy liked this hotel. It was in good walking distance from many interesting places like Notre Dame and Louvre. Also many resturants. We realy liked the resturants on a lively street near Notre Dame - you麓ll find it when you walked from the hotel down Boulevard St. Michel. The hotel is very old and charming. The room was small but nice and clean. The breakfast room was also nice - as the breakfast. The staff was healpfull and nice. The elevator was the smallest I麓ve ever seen but I think that the elevators in Paris is all rather small. We loved Paris and when we go back - witch will be - I will surely book at this hotel again. Didn麓t cost to much and was worth any penny!!!

<Content>The Wonderful Concierge Service.... I just needed a one night stay before returning home. I wish I had stayed at this hotel my entire stay in Paris. On the down side the bed was not especially comfortable and it was typically tiny (by US standards) but big enough to move around in. Also, sound travels through the floors and walls but this wasn't a big problem because the clients of Grand Hommes seem a particularly quite bunch. The hotel made up for these minor issues because the staff was so polite, professional and helpful. This was really welcome because during my 10 day business stay in Europe I had encountered some hotel staff that ranged from I really hate my job to I really hate you. The appointments in the bathroom were perfect and the entire place is impeccably decorated and clean, clean, clean! I had to check out before breakfast was served but the desk staff made me a nice cup of coffee gratis. I had the superior room and although it didn't face the Pantheon, it was on a quiet courtyard with double doors that opened onto a private little terrace with a cafe table and two chairs. Next time I'm in Paris, I would like to stay at Grand Hommes for pleasure - you can't get much more romantic - with the Pantheon across the street, a long view of the Effel Tower around the corner, and the Seine and Luxembourg Gardens just a stroll away. I wouldn't consider this a family/kid/teen kind of place, nor was it for the young and hip - but for the rest of us with a couple hunderd Euros to spend for a night's lodging I definately recommend it.

<Content>Very good hotel, amazing blog I stayed quite a while ago at this hotel at a discount which made it great value for money. Rooms are nicely decorated and bathroom was impeccable. Staff was very friendly and not intrusive.But actually what I like best about this hotel is the way they keep in touch with customers through their own blog:[--]Once a month they produce a beautiful newsletter with tips/reviews/images that you won't find in your usual city guide. I think this has to be the best way to keep you longing to go back to Paris.

<Content>Loved this Hotel!!!! My husband and I very recently traveled to Paris. Never having been I was a bit nervous about booking blind hotel reservations. Thanks to this website and the very honest reviews given, I was able to select this very nice hotel. FYI- if you want a view of the Pantheon from your room, be sure to request. The accommodations were very nice. The decor of the room was beautiful! It was small (that's just Europe) but comfortable.Breakfast is not included in the reservation but, there are so many bistros and shops along the way. Theres' a store two blocks or so behind the hotel. The location was perfect in that the street itself was nice and quiet at night, but you only need to walk a block and you are in a circle full of shops, restaurants and people!!The hotel staff was more than pleasant and very helpful.This hotel would be my first call once after booking plane tickets!

<Content>Friendly Staff We stayed at the Hotel des Grand Hommes to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. It was an ideal location for our needs, as we enjoyed the close proximity to Luxumberg Gardens and the colorful markets of Rue Moufftard. The staff at the hotel were very nice and helpful and offered wonderful suggestions for dining, etc. The rooms are on the small side (like many rooms in large cities), but they are very clean and tidy. Our room was 11 and overlooked the Pantheon. It can get a bit noisy during rush hour traffic and also at night because the students like to hang out in the square well into the morning and due to the design of the 5 surrounding buildings, it echoes. Bring earplugs.Some travel tips for Paris:Bring a light jacket (it was very cool during our stay in the middle of June)Buy a Paris Museum Pass - if you're planning to visit multiple museums and landmarks, this is a deal, but it's worth it in itself because you can override the long queues at most of the museums including the Orsay and Louvre. It's 45 euro for a 4 day pass and was worth every cent.Buy a Metro Pass - purchase a metro pass only for the number of days you need and the zones you know you will travel. Unless you're planning to visit Versailles or use the RER to get to and from the airport, you don't need more than zones 1 - 3 to see all of Paris's landmarks.Do as the Parisiennes and enjoy your meals with time to spare.Learn a few phrases in French, like je voudrais - I'd like and please and thank you. The French appreciate the effort, even if you butcher their elegant language.

<Content>A nice stay, and good deals to be made I got a non-refundable early reservation rate on the hotel's website, and that was about 35% below full fare. On top of that, they upgraded me from a standard room to a superior one, for no apparent reason: I didn't ask for it and they didn't mention it. So I ended up with a truly good deal: 158 EUR/night for a superior room with a balcony, instead of 310 EUR full fare. The balcony was great for having breakfast.Given my experience and the phone conversations I overheard at the front desk, it sounds they're very flexible about prices and upgrades.Location is perfect -- just on the Place du Panth茅on, a very nice looking plaza.Wake-up calls were not reliable: in just 4 days, the staff messed up two of them! The first time, the receptionist apologized. The second time, with another receptionist, I don't think they even realized the problem. Bottom line: bring an alarm clock.Phone calls are outrageously priced, even for toll-free numbers! Avoid by all means (free wifi: use Skype).All in all, this was a very nice stay, and the staff was very courteous.

<Content>Expensive 3* but worth every cent ! Hotel is in an excellent location and most Paris sights and a great selection of restaurants are within easy walking distance. The proximity to the RER for quick access to and from CDG airport is a real bonus.As bedrooms in 3* Paris hotels tend to be on the small side, we were pleased with the relative spaciousness of our room, which was spotlessly clean.Hotel staff were friendly and helpful and readily did internet searches to answer any of our queries.A bit to the upper limit of 3* prices but quality-wise I would regard it as 4* hotel.

We'll stay again nexy time we're in Paris. The only minor negative is that the rooms are awfully small (huge beds make it even worse). You can pay more and get larger rooms so that may be a good option. All in all we had a great stay and recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Perfect for Paris in Spring! After visiting Paris many many times in various locations (though mainly near the Invalides (as a keen Napoleonic scholar) I have to say that I can't imagine staying anywhere but theGrands Hommes in future trips.My wife and I loved it! Very pleasant,helpful staff,beautiful decor - looks more over the top in photo's than in real life!The best thing is it's situation,we went 2nd-5th May,a busy weekend and it was so peaceful.Despite some absurd reviews suggesting the walk from the RER station is akin to tackling Everest,it is in fact a 5minute walk up a gentle incline with the Jardins de Luxembourg behind you and The Pantheon ahead,wonderful views day or night.The hotel is to the right of the Pantheon as you walk up Rue Soufflot.Plenty of shops,restaurants and sights right outside the hotel- the Eiffel Tower lighting up like fireworks every hour on the hour at night.Great hotel,great location.

<Content>Charming and Friendly Grand Hommes Experience My husband and I enjoyed an outstanding experience at the Hotel des Grands Hommes. Our room overlooked the Pantheon, a domed building housing the tombs of several famous people, including Marie Curie. The hotel's location was superb. It's in the Latin Quarter near the local university. There were several (at least 4) cafes on the same street as the hotel, as well as a few banks. Numerous cafes as well as a creperie lined the several blocks nearby. The hotel was just a block away from a metro stop and the Luxembuorg Gardens. I actually went on several morning jogs in the Gardens. It was also walking distance (between 15-20 minutes) from several quintessential Paris sites including Notre Dame, the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay and the Jardins de Tuilleries. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and spoke English, perhaps better than me. They graciously booked an excursion and unsolicited offered to arrange transportation to the airport. The room was large by Paris standards (short hallway led to room with double bed, tv, small couch and chair, and 2 closets). The room had a seperate water closet and bathroom with shower and sink. It was immaculate. The decor was quite charming. The hotel was a warm and friendly base for exploring the city. I would definitely recommend it to others and would stay there again.

<Content>Terrific hotel near the Pantheon This hotel is a great choice. The rooms and bathrooms are extremely large for Paris standards. The decor and room furnishings were of equisite taste and in excellent condition. The staff were kind and helpful. Being an American, I'm used to air conditioning and it would have been nice to have it on one hot day (a/c is not provided until the hottest months of the year). The hotel is literally feet from the Pantheon. We found that the best metro stop was the RER stop at Luxembourg (which is to say that the hotel is only a couple blocks from the Luxembourg gardens). That's the only other drawback -- that the metro isn't super close by. But, the area is safe and beautiful. Don't miss out on the Eglise St. Etienne du Mont. It's basically around the corner from the hotel. Check the hotel's website for great rates. And if you haven't stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes before, be sure to put it on your list for your next visit.

<Content>Valentines' Weekend in Paris Stayed here in a standard room for 4 nights, me and my husband. The hotel is very nice, quite small, our room was particularly small (with a strangely large bathroom!) but perfectly formed. Nice decor, and really felt like you were in Paris which is not often the case if you stop at a chain hotel like Hilton. Breakfast room was nice and the staff were very friendly. The only downside was on the last day they were filming something in reception and we weren't allowed in!! We were running late for the airport so we made nuisances of ourselves so we could get in to get our suitcases. Not a great way to end our stay unfortunately! Good location close to Luxembourg RER and Cardinal-Lemoine metro station. Walking distance to Notre Dame, Louvre etc.

<Content>Great hotel with great view My wife and I have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes. We stayed in the deluxe room on the 6th floor that included a balcony with a spectacular view of the Pantheon. We booked the room on the hotel website and received a substantial discount. The room and lobby were very nicely decorated. The deluxe room size was adequate based on European standards, but I imagine a standard room would be tight. There was no alarm clock, iron/ironing board or coffee maker in the room (as is typical in US hotels). Not a problem as long as you are prepared, though it is much more difficult to buy coffee in Paris (without sitting down in a cafe) than it is in the US. The wireless internet was a great amenity and worked just as well as my internet connection at home. We were able to stream Sirius satellite radio while we were in our room. The TV size was adequate but only received one English speaking station (BBC Worldwide). The English-speaking staff were courteous and helpful. The A/C worked fine, but note that you must stick the key in a slot by the door for the electricity to turn on.The hotel is near many restaurants and nightlife, yet was relatively quiet at night since it was not on a busy road. Make sure to head east of the Pantheon toward Rue de Mouffetard (5 minute walk). This area is packed with cafes and bars. Of course, with the American dollar so low, everything is expensive. Expect to pay around $35 - $40 for a simple breakfast/lunch for 2 at a cafe (prices include tax and service) or $8 - $10 for a beer. A moderate dinner for 2 could easily cost $70 - $80 without drinks. You will get much more for you money if you buy take-out food and eat it outside or in your room. If you eat at a cafe, make sure to check if they accept credit cards and if service is included. As a rule of thumb, if the menu is not translated into English, then the staff probably does not speak English very well or at all.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel immensely would definitely return in the future. The ideal location and views definitely made our Paris experience much more enjoyable.

<Content>Great location  The hotel's website annoyed me because the headline rate only applied to the first night, with subsequent nights going up in price. It also had a 'bargain basement' feel about it. In fact, if it were not that our friends had already booked into the hotel, I would have gone elsewhere. Therefore, when we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find a much more upmarket establishment than the website suggested. The room and ensuite bathroom were both fine and well-appointed. Our only complaint was that, even though the heating was off, it was terribly hot. Our friends found the same in their room. The staff were friendly, helpful and spoke good English. The location is excellent (the Latin Quarter) with good cafes nearby and good transport links.

<Content>Fantastic time We had a fantastic stay at this hotel. All the staff was very friendly, anticipated our needs by offering to book restaurant reservations, checking to see if we needed a taxi to the airport a few days ahead of departure, to offering umbrellas to us the day it rained. The place was clean, the bathrooms great by Parisian standards. The Metro stop was close, as was the RER making a return trip to the airport very easy, as well as getting around for sightseeing.My only suggestion is that the hotel staff inform you that you need to put your key card in the slot by the door so you can operate the lighting in the room, it took us a few minutes of consternation before we figured this out on our own. the hotel staff was very kind when we forgot the key card in the slot in the room and retireved it for us with a smile!

<Content>What a find! I booked this hotel after reading all the great reviews, they were right! Wonderful small hotel, with exceptionally pleasant staff. I felt as though I was staying with family because of them and the general homely feeling of my room. I booked a single room for 鈧?7 on Expedia, best rate I could find. It wasn't a large room, but still a small double bed rather than a single. It was remarkably clean, and a lovely bathroom. If the rooms would be slightly larger it would rate 4* I believe. But it's a hotelroom, you're not moving in there permanently. Only minor issue was that my (standard) room was on the internal courtyard. I had to keep my window closed because of the noise of other rooms which all had the windows open. It was unusually warm for May and the airconditioning wasn't able to keep the temperature down. I will definately return, but opt for a more expensive room at the front with views of the Pantheon.

Tastefully appointed, a spacious seating area, great view of the Pantheon and a generous bathroom beautifully fixtured. Immaculately clean room and hotel overall. A friendly, welcoming and helpful staff at all times. The cozy, cavelike downstairs breakfast room isan excellent value at 12 euros given how little the pitiful dollar will buy you anywhere else in Paris. This is a hotel operated to a high standard and I recommend it absolutely.

<Content>Great place to stay in Paris The hotel is well situated on the left bank. The staff were helpful and friendly and the room, while small (European small) was well appointed and cozy. It clearly had been upgraded and renovated tastefully in recent years.The only thing a traveler may want to know is that the closest underground is the RER three blocks away (across from the beautiful Luxembourg Gardens). That means taking the RER to another station and transferring to the Metro to reach most places in the city (Chatelet seemed the easiest transfer point). We did not find it to be a problem, but travelers should be aware of it.

<Content>Fabulous hotel Fantastic location We were only in Paris for one night, April 21, and wanted a hotel that would allow us to see as much of Paris in the two partial days we were there. The Grands Hommes fit the bill. As two architects, the view to the Pantheon out the window could not have been more perfect. The staff was a pleasure to deal with, and the location could not have been more centralized. I think we logged 12 miles of walking the loop of Notre Dame (right down the street), the Pont Neuf, Louvre, Tuillerie Jardin, Eiffel Tower, and Luxembourg Gardens. Cafes and good dining abounds in this area. Access from the airport was crazy easy via the RER and transport to the Gare Monteparnasse was simple via the bus system (which is INCREDIBLY clean). Five stars in my book for the Grands Hommes. I will definitely stay with them again on my next (perhaps longer) jaunt to Paris.

<Content>Horrible cancellation policy - beware! My husband and I were supposed to stay at this hotel at the end of August for our wedding anniversary. I got a good rate through their summer promotion and booked directly through their website. If you do that, please be careful and read the small print! Once you book it, it's impossible to cancel or change the date. I made the reservation 5 months in advance, then I found out that I was pregnant and couldn't go to Paris anymore. I contacted the hotel in hopes that they will consider my special situation and refund my money since I was giving them 4 months advance notice! No such luck. I was told that it was impossible refund my money and due to some account reason they couldn't even move my reservation to another date. That is too bad - I was really excited about staying at this hotel and would have definitely come back to them next summer.

<Content>2nd visit but not our last This was our second visit - September 2005 and now in April 2008The d茅cor in the hotel public rooms and bedrooms is gorgeous with fabric-clad walls; exquisite furniture, little touches of luxury and care throughout and the bathrooms are very well appointed. The location could not be better, both for the major sites of Paris 鈥?use the BatoBus it鈥檚 fabulous 鈥?and even within steps of the hotel you can find shops for wine, cheese, pastries, charceuterie, deli, books, clothing, you name it, and restaurants and bars of every type you could want and of course, the Pantheon right there.I have read the previous comments. First: the elevator (lift), yes it is slow, but it鈥檚 there and it works and after all it is an old building and a small hotel. The slowness is worst during the morning; we are guessing because of check in and outs and/or people going up and down to breakfast. Also housekeeping probably increase the delays at that time as they push the housekeeping trolley on and off at each floor but hey, the rooms are perfectly clean and the staff have to get there to do that don鈥檛 they? With regard to the issue of having no irons in the rooms, yes it would be nice to have but the space is tight. I gave it some thought and think that it could work if they incorporated a fold down small size ironing board on the inside back of a closet or bathroom door and supplied those tiny travel irons. It would be all that most people need and for anything more there is a laundry service. Other than that鈥?as a person who is on the short side my daily exercise reaching up and even jumping a bit to get a towel off the rack was somewhat amusing but stretching is good for the body anyway isn鈥檛 it? The staff are wonderful. Charming, patient, courteous and attentive and nothing appears to be too much trouble, they are always ready to assist each and every guest. We would both just like to add that the fact that the staff are also incredibly good looking 鈥?we are talking 鈥榯hey are probably models in their spare time off鈥?type handsome/beautiful looks here - had no impact on our opinion. ;o) Can鈥檛 wait to go back again, we miss it already.

<Content>Grand hotel with grand view We stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes for four nights in April 2008, in a Superior room with view. Was a fantastic experience. The staff were incredibly helpful and all seemed to speak English. We were prepared for a small room having read what Paris hotel rooms are like, but were pleasantly surprised. The bathroom was small, but the bedroom had enough room to fit a 2-seater lounge as well as the bed plus enough room for two suitcases on the floor. The view of the Pantheon was magnificent. Hotel is in a great location with plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. Will definitely be staying in this hotel when we return to Paris.

<Content>Great Little Hotel- Spectaular Staff Spent 4 nights in April. Room 61, a superior double room on top floor with a terrace. Room was small even by European standards, but plenty of storage space so luggage was out of the way. Room looked out on the Pantheon and was very quiet after 10p. Also wonderful view of Effiel Tower from in front of the Pantheon.Real shower and tub in nice sized bathroom. A 4-5 min walk on wide smooth streets from the Luxembourg RER station which only has 2 flights of 7 stairs, so only have to carry your luggage up 14 stairs). Direct train from/to CDG. Parc Luxembourg has a good jogging trail around perimeter.Roman (sp?) and all the reception staff were fabulous- very friendly and helpful. All spoke English and helped me make or cancel several dinner reservations. I cannot say enough about how great the staff was. They even got two plates and two wine glasses for us so we could eat a picnic lunch on our terrace. (food stuff, wine, cheeses and fruits we bought at the open air maket on Rue Moffeltard)Breakfast room is in a wonderful cellar, but breakfast itself was just okay. Easy and short downhill walk to main St Germain area and to Notre Dame. Plus several Velib city bike rental racks nearby all of which were primarily empty, a major concern when you want return a Velib bike.Lots of good restaurants in the area. Dont miss all the little eating places on Rue Pot Au Fer. Our favorite place was Les Papilles, a small wine store at 30 Rue Gay-Lussac (3-5 min walk) with 10 or so tables. No ordering here, you eat what they cook that day-- a 4 course meal with sittings at 730p and 930pm. You pick your wine from their retail store selection and pay store price plus 7 euros corkage-- so you get great wine at decent price. Call to make sure you like what they are serving that day. The famous Balzar brassiere is a 5min walk. We booked on hotel website and got tremendous rate around 60% discount, but had to prepay with no cancellation.

<Content>Great location, charming accomodations My husband  I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary with a trip to Europe. We stayed 4 nights at the Hotel des Grand Hommes. We were really happy with the hotel. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. They had even left a hand written note and a little jar of chocolates congratulating us on our anniversary when we checked into our room. Room  common areas were extremely clean. Breakfast was included with our stay. The hotel has a really charming little breakfast nook area with cereal, criossants, cheeses  meats. Location was great -- just a short walk to a couple of metro stops, shops, cafes, etc. and the Luxembourg Gardens. At night, if you stand outside the Pantheon, you can see the Eiffel Tower twinkling in the distance. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Ideal We chose this hotel for our 3 night stay because of the excellent reviews by other Trip Advisor travellers and it fully met our expectations.Centrally yet quietly located, very friendly, comfortable, safe, clean and good value. Grands Hommes more than meets all the essentials which is not the case for most Paris hotels we've previously visited. Our second floor double room overlooking a small courtyard was in very good decorative condition and the style was indeed decorative! Pale blue wallpaper with ornate floral motif, cerise and white timbered ceiling contrasting with the blue/gold patterned carpet.It was 'cosy, ie. small. The furniture was somewhat crammed in and their was limited space for hanging clothes had we been staying longer. The bed was firm and comfortable. We had a minibar, safe deposit box and small tv with CNN and BBC World.The bathroom also appeared to have been very recently refurbished.It passes the acid test - we will return.

<Content>Recommended Had a quick trip to Paris with my teenage son, to see the sights. The hotel is in a great and safe location and we had a superb view of the Pantheon from our room, but thankfully, the room was quiet overnight. The room and bathroom were very well appointed, though there really isn't a place to sit and relax; but we weren't in Paris to sit in a hotel room so it didn't matter. The hotel was clean and all the staff were friendly and helpful. I look forward to another opportunity to stay there.

Our room was on the fifth floor and looked directly across the square to the Pantheon - wonderful location - we walked everywhere in old Paris and received great directions and restaurant suggestions from the very helpful staff. Breakfast was terrific each day with marvelous folks serving - very cheerful and happy each morning. Would recommend to friends.

<Content>Great view Really nice room. It was small but it didn't feel like your average hotel room, because the furniture and decoration was classy and unusual.Good location, a couple of minutes' walk from the Metro and a stroll from many of Paris's best-known sights. Terrific view of the Pantheon from our room.Facilities fine.Only sour note: I phoned reception the day before we arrived to order flowers for my girlfriend's birthday. They were really helpful and the roses duly arrived outside our room in the morning.However, the effect was rather ruined as we were checking out, when the morning receptionist told me, loudly and in front of my girlfriend, that there was a problem with the bill as we still owed 36 Euros for the flowers. er, thanks.And the lift is recommended only to the intrepid.

<Content>Best hotel in Paris so far! This was our fifth trip to Paris, and we have generally stayed on the Rive Gauche. The Grands Hommes is a small place, but we found the atmosphere welcoming and the whole building spotlessly clean. All the front desk staff were keen to help us, and the service was way above its 3 star rating. There's no bar, but the hotel makes drinks available to the room all day and night. We had a front room with a great view over the Place de Panth茅on, and a good en-suite bathroom. All in all, a great place to stay that doesn't leave you feeling ripped off! Highly recommended.

<Content>Easter Break We stayed here March 2008 for 8 nights, room 11 with lovely view overlooking the Pantheon. We found the location was good, 10-15 minutes to River Seine, restaurants 2 minutes walk, area felt safe. Hotel was immaculately clean, very well maintained and beautifully presented and staff friendly and efficient. Our room was very comfortable and cleaned daily and couldn't have asked for more. Our only advice would be if you are a light sleeper not to book rooms at the front. We were woken nightly with street noise...cars, people walking by......not the hotels fault, but also the hotel entrance doors are automatic and as our room was on the floor above the doors we found the noise of them sliding open/shut irritating. Had we stayed at the rear of the building and higher up to avoid street noise/doors would have rated 4/5 but we had to give 3.

<Content>Romantic Stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes My husband and I had the opportunity to go to Paris without kids and absolutely loved L'Hotel des Grands Hommes. The service was great and the beautiful room we were given had a balcony overlooking the Pantheon. It was just a gorgeous view! We could see as far as Montmartre on a clear day. The closest Metro is the RER Luxembourg station, a couple of blocks down and the neighborhood was great. The breakfast service was very good, the lady in charge (I think her name is Marina) is lovely. OK, so the rooms are a bit small, but who cares? This was Paris! Highly recommendable - Quite a charming place!

<Content>Tres Bon! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Des Grandes Hommes from March 5th to March 10th. This was our first trip to Paris, and we were beyond pleased with the hotel. We spent a lot of time trying to decide which hotel we were to stay at; checking numerous web-sites, and reviews. First, no matter which web-site you check, the reviews of the hotel are consistent. All web-sites rate the hotel highly, and most all who stay are very pleased.Second, the hotel was spotless, and upon entering for the first time, the lobby is beautiful and classy. The photos of the hotel on the websites are accurate. The hotel looked as good as the pictures they posted for advertisement. The staff is extreemly helpful and courteous. They attended to our needs immediately, and spoke English, in my opinion, very well. I did speak a little bit of French, but they let me off the hook, and always spoke to me in English. We had no trouble communicating with them.As for the size of the room; understand that hotel rooms in Paris are not big at all, compared to American standards. However, I felt the rooms were plenty big. We had a room with a balcony, so it was lovely to sit on the balcony and look at the Panthenon. You have about 2 feet of walking space arount the perimeter of the bed. A large writing desk and chair where the TV sits, with about 2 feet on either side. In our room (#51) we had two nice sizeable closets. One with multiple shelves and a mini fridge where we placed all our folding clothes, another closet, where we put our hanging clothes, and it was also large enough to hold our suitcases. The bathroom was plenty big. Only one sink, but it was large enough for both of us to be getting ready at the same time, and we didn't feel too crowded.Overall, I recommend the hotel highly. You are close to everything in the Latin Quarter, and besides, there is nothing like leaving your hotel , turning the corner, and having the perfect view of the Eiffel Tower to start your day!Bon Voyage!

It's also super easy to get to charles de gaulle, disneyland by RER (louxembourg RER station on st. michel is 3 mins away). Also within walking distance to notre dame, and the elegant st. germain (10-15mins). if you like crepes, gyros, kebabs @1AM, and pubs/supermarkets/pharmacies, amorino ice cream and want to be near cafe le cercle...(the best hot chocolate in paris...and i've tried hotel crillon's hot chocolate...it's just as good...right next to the louxembourg RER station), then this hotel is for you :). the rooms are small (we had the deluxe room facing the panteon) but the balcony was great. the hotel was very quiet (too quiet sometimes :). And the best part was that the maids left little chocolate squares on the pillows, if we did not trash the room too much :). Everything was super clean as well.

The location is perfect for exploring Paris, only a 5 minute walk from the central hub of the city bus tours. We were able to catch three different tours for this point outside the Notre dam Church. The staff at the hotel were freindly, the room was on the small side, but think it was bigger than everage for Paris, nice decor and very quiet. Nice big bath, and the room was well looked after.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Picked this place out for the trip during which I proposed to my girlfriend. They had the best mix of high TripAdvisor rating, cozy size, reasonable price, and fantastic location.Felt as though they were a partner in the planning of my proposal trip, and made an effort to find me a room with a full balcony and wonderful view of the Pantheon.Location in the heart of the Latin quarter is unbeatable. The Sorbonne right nearby and there's a cool student-vibe in the streets at night. Only consideration would be that they obviously don't have the staff of a Hyatt or Hilton so don't always expect things like the front desk picking up the phone immediately at night.

Stade de France is also on the same line which makes the hotel a good location if going to a 6 Nations game. Hotel is also walking distance to Notre Dame. We booked the hotel based on the reviews on the trip advisor and were not disappointed. We asked and got a room with a balcony  view over the pantheon which was excellent. Would stay here again on our next visit Paris.

<Content>Great little hotel, We stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes in March of 2008, for 5 nights, we booked two double rooms which were quite small but adequate for our purpose for ourselves and my two teenage sons. The rooms were nice and clean, although they overlooked the interior courtyard which was not very nice. But since we were out most of the day it didn't really matter. We found the staff to be very helpful with suggestions and making any arrangements for taxis or restaurants. The hotel is about a 7 minute walk to the nearest subway station, and there are cafes and restaurants everywhere, including an internet cafe. I would recommend this hotel to any one who wants to stay near the latin quarter which is within reasonable walking distance from the hotel.

<Content>Good experience My wife and I recently got back from our Paris vacation. We stayed at this hotel in no small part to the reviews we found on tripadvisor. We had a great time in Paris.Overall the hotel was great. The staff spoke English which was wonderful as our French are extremely limited. We found everyone to be friendly. The check-in and check-out procedure was as expected with no issues. We stayed in room 54. I saw some of the comments from other travelers and they were mostly confirmed in that the room size is small but adequate for our stay and as expected for European standards (our hotel room in our London visit was pretty small as well). Everything was kept clean which is most important for us.There are a few things to note. First of all regarding the location. It's true that the Metro and RER stations are not right at the doorstep like they might be for other hotels however having both the RER and Metro nearby was very convenient since it provided more options. We ended up using the RER to go back and forth to the airport and used it mostly to get out and see the sights (after transferring to Metro stations). I would not recommend airport transfer using the RER for anyone with a lot of luggage that can't be easily transported up and down stairs, or for anyone with kids. Otherwise I personally found it convenient and cheap!A few words of caution. Don't count on using an iron. The only iron in the hotel is at the basement, next to the elevator and besides the restaurant. If you must use it, avoid the mornings when people are going back to forth to breakfast and you are in the middle of it trying to iron your clothes (like I was :)) I would recommend that a portable ironing board and iron be made available to guests on request. A minor nuisance as I only needed to use it once, but still something to watch out for.Next I found out that unlike with most hotels you turn in your key to reception when you leave your room and retrieve it again when you return. That was fine with me although what was strange is that to retrieve your key you just walked up and requested the key for room XX. There was no confirmation that it was your room, you were just handed your key. Theoratically I could have asked a key to whatever room I wanted (assuming that someone was checked in) and could have gotten it. Again, not a big deal, but it struck me as odd and unlikely something that would have happened in a US based hotel. In a similar fashion, when I checked in they didn't request any ID, I just walked up, said my name, and was handed a key. Very different from US based hotels, not better or worse, just different.There was one nuisance and that is a couple of times during my stay I would leave at 9 am, come back at 5 pm and either the room was in the process of being cleaned or in one case it was half done but the person had left in the midst of it. Maybe coincidence but I started hanging the tag that indicates please clean the room when I would leave and didn't have that issue anymore. That was only a minor point.Overall I would recommend this hotel and would definately return if and when I come back to Paris. It was a comfortable stay, we liked the location of the hotel and he staff were all courteous and helpful. Oh, and if you do stay at the hotel I recommend going to Crepes a Go Go a great little crepe place a couple of blocks away from the hotel. Loved the staff and the crepes were awesome! Have fun!

All the major shopping and dining areas, and sights, are in easy walking distance, and it鈥檚 no more than five minutes walk from Luxemburg RER station, which brings you directly to Charles De Gaulle airport. Thanks to the hotel鈥檚 proximity to the Sorbonne, the nearby bars and restaurants are always buzzing, and the prices are more reasonable than the more obvious 鈥渢ouristy鈥?places. The room we had this time was smaller than before but it had a balcony with a view over the Pantheon to Sacre Couer which was fabulous. Even though it was March, we had a glass of bubbly here every night before heading out for dinner. We will definitely be staying here for our next visit to Paris.

<Content>Beautiful Parisian Hotel I booked this Hotel as a result of Tripadvisor comments and wasn't disappointed by it. Our welcome was warm  helpful, and the room was even nicer than we had expected. Ours had a view of the Pantheon and while small, was beautifully decorated. The bathroom was clean and bigger than most I have been in.It was in a great location, close to Metro stop and a shortish walk from Notre-Dame. There were plenty of small caf茅s and restaurants in the locality and we felt spoilt for choice.Our only gripes about the Hotel were, that there was no Tea/Coffee making facility in the room and the Hotel had no bar, only the Lobby. When we wanted to relax between our sightseeing  dinner, we had to either go out again or stay in the room. Apart from that, I would recommend this Hotel to others.

<Content>Lovely hotel, shame about the noise. Stayed three nights at the G.H. A hotel with character, good location, great cafes nearby, five mins. to R.E.R. station, charming room on fifth floor (51), front of hotel.Was a anniversary trip and were made most welcome by all staff .First night had a good sleep - quiet night-Second night little sleep - Pantheon opposite had work being done on it (putting up banners between the pillars using loud hoists). Checked windows were closed. Down to reception to explain problem, could not resolve problem as it was outwith the hotel, which to be fair it was, I was also informed no other guest had complained. This work stopped as 4.42am.Thrid night noted hoists still in place - bought ear-plugs at pharmacy down the road. These were required and worked as the racket started again late at night.A really nice hotel, but best pack some ear-plugs these banners will have to come down sometime! Would have given much higher rating if not for noise.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Great Customer Service We stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes for 2 nights at the end of February 2008. The hotel was easy to get to from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport by train to the centre of Paris (St. Michel Station), then a 10 minute walk from the station to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel our room had been upgraded so we had a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the Pantheon. The room was lovely, clean and very comfortable plus the ensuite had a bath (recommended after a long day sight seeing around Paris). Breakfast was not included in the room rate but at 12 euros per person, I would recommend it as there was a really good continental style breakfast with lots of choice and great value. The staff were very friendly and really helpful throughout our stay. The hotel is in a lovely area and really central for many of the sites, which are in walking distance and there are lots of cafes and resturants close by for meals and drinks on an evening.I have already recommended the hotel to a friend and would definately go back in the future.

Hotel very centrally located right beside the Pantheon. Rooms were small but very comfortable and cleaned every day. No complaints about hotel and would definitely stay here again. One word of warning, be careful of pickpockets, especailly young girls aged 11 or 12, on the Paris underground. They are very professional and your purse could be gone from your bag in a matter of seconds!

<Content>Good location but expensive for what you get As you arrive at the hotel you are treated to the best aspect of the hotel, the location. Across the street from the Pantheon and close to Notre Dame, the hotel is in a very good location in the Latin Quarter. We stayed in a double room, which we found to be very small even by European standards. The bathroom was very nice and modern. We were able to book the room through an internet deal for half-price but I could not imagine paying the full price (270E) for a room this small. Great location but the hotel does not provide anything extraordinary and we found ourselves thinking on more than one occasion that one of the front desk staff we're less than helpful.

<Content>A great place to stay We have just returned from a short stay at this hotel. I have used Trip Advisor many times but this is the first time that I have felt so strongly that I wanted to write a review.I agree with all the good comments we read on Trip Advisor. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the hotel was very clean and in a great position. It is true, as others have said, that the room was small but it was a lovely room. We paid the extra for a room with a view and it was well worth it. I booked on the hotel website as it seemed to offer the best rate for the room.We will certainly go back to this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel In Paris We stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes from February 16-21. We had an excellent time and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were small, but the norm for Paris and Europe in general. The bed was comfortable, the room and bathroom very clean, and we felt very safe at the hotel's location. Speaking of location-the hotel is easy to access via the Metro or the RER Luxemborg stop. It is also in easy walking distance to the Luxemborg Gardens, the Seine, and Notre Dame. I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler.

<Content>Small but perfect by the Pantheon Within 10 minutes' walk of St Germain and the river, and a couple of minutes from the Luxembourg Gardens, this place is excellent if you want a relatively quietly situated 'classy' small hotel with good rooms. As everyone says, the bedrooms are generally quite small in Parisian hotels, and our superior double was fairly tight, but very well furnished, with a big comfy bed and decent bathroom. It also had two pairs of French windows onto a little balcony with a tiny table and chairs, and a fantastic outlook directly onto the Pantheon. If you want a balcony you need to get a fifth floor room or higher.It's strictly BB with no bar or dining room, but you probably wouldn't want those anyway as you're in a great part of the city with excellent bars and bistrots. Breakfast is 12 Euro and is taken in a nice looking room in the basement, but we didn't have it, preferring to go out to other places.All in all, thoroughly recommended and we'll be back.

<Content>pantheon view i have seen the hotel more than 15 years ago passing by the pantheon and my goal was to stay there once, then i have found a very good deal for the four nights and i have booked.i cannot really regret my choice, the room was very tiny, but the style and the view were amazing.the bathroom was nice size and the closets too. i have shared a superior room with a friend and we both wish to go back one day.never had breakfast at the hotel as i am on diet, but pictures of the buffet breakfast looked good.the only pity is that the wireless is just in the lobby and the lobby has not a nice corner where to stay, without taking all the freezing air coming from outside when the sliding doors gets opened each time someone pass in front of them.but i really have enjoyed my stay.

<Content>Great Hotel We recently returned from our stay of 4 nights at this hotel. The location can't be beat - a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame (and a 30 second walk to the Pantheon). The hotel was very clean. The room was small, but we are looking for a nice clean place to sleep, we aren't living in the hotel room when we travel. The bed was very comfortable. The staff was very helpful - they gave us recommendations for dinner, and also helped print out our boarding passes for our return trip. There was alot of construction at the hotel next door (when I believe is the same ownership), but we only heard this when we stopped back to our room quickly during the afternoon. The TV did not work the first day, but we reported this to the front desk, and it was fine after that.We would definitely return to the Hotel des Grands Hommes on our next trip to Paris.

<Content>We love the HGM The Hotel des Grands Hommes was everything that we had hoped for. It was very easy to find the hotel as it is only 5 minutes walk from Luxembourg RER station which is a very easy and convenient train ride from CDG airport. The hotel is also a very easy walk from Cardinal Lemoine metro station.Our superior room on the 5th floor was small but absolutely spotless and very comfortable and had a great balcony with view of the Pantheon. It was also completely silent at night and we slept beautifully. We felt that we were the only guests as during our entire four night stay we hardly saw or heard another soul. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel so cant comment on that. We preferred to grab a bite at one of the many nearby cafes or boulangeries. We liked the area that the hotel is in with a great studenty atmosphere but those looking to find night time action may find it a little on the quiet side.The staff were very pleasant although we did not really need to speak to them as we were completely satisfied with every aspect of our stay. When we return to Paris we would certainly consider staying here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>A jewel of a hotel We stayed on the upper floor with a direct view of the Pantheon.The service was excellent. The rooms are smaller than other boutique sytle hotels that we have stayed in previous years.A quiet, intimate hotel that was just a few blocks from the heart of the Latin Quarter. Even though we are very close to a metro stop we were also a few steps from a bus stop . This time in Paris we bused everywhere. Much more pleasant than a metro.Having lived in Paris for a year as a student (a number of years ago) we felt that we were geting a true French  experience. The staff however, does speak English. We will be back.

<Content>Great Welcome to Paris From booking on the Grands Hommes website (at a discount for early reservation), right through to our departure, everything worked perfectly. Our superior room on the second floor had a small balcony which overlooked the Pantheon, giving a wonderful view and the facility to enjoy watching the street life below. The room was quite small, but beautifully decorated in traditional style and very comfortable with mini bar and safe. Breakfast is simple by nicely prepared and presented in the pleasant cellar room. All the staff were helpful and friendly and there are plenty of good restaurants, bars and walks in the immediate vicinity. I would definitely recommend this hotel as an excellent base from which to explore Paris.

<Content>Lovely stay at Hotel Des Grands Hommes We booked a long weekend at H des G H after seeing loads of great recommendations on Trip Advisor. The hotel was pretty perfect for what we wanted: great location, within walking distance to the Marais area plus right next to Luxembourg Gardens and some fab cafes and a few bars. The room itself was pretty small but not unbearably so and we loved the Parisian decor. For a friendly, small hotel, in a great location for a similarly good price it's definately worth a stay here.

<Content>Excellent in every way. My wife and I spent five days at the Hotel des Grands Hommes in Movember and were totally pleased. The room was immaculate, the bathroom was suitably large, and the assistance we received from the staff was flawless. I am in the hotel business (Marriott) and know something about hotels. All in this business is comparative...one compares hotel with like-hotel, not with fantasy or super-luxury. We are returning to Paris in November and we will book at the Hotel des Grands Hommes again. Might add that the restaurant below the lobby was very quaint and the food (and the manager) were excellent. The gentleman on nights was very helpful in getting us a taxi to the airport early on the AM of our departure. Unfortunately in the rush we did not get his name, but merci beaucoup.

<Content>Not what we were hoping for We spent three nights at the Hotel des Grandes Hommes (we were to spend 7 originally) and were slightly disappointed with the hotel. Although it was at a great location the room left a fair bit to be desired. The reception on the TV was very poor and although we were promised that it would be fixed immediately it was the same for our whole stay. Also the lighting in the room ws very poor and the internet access was virtually non-existent; that is to say that it did have connection but the service was too slow to do anything. I tried to use the internet at all times including 2am just in case it was a heavy user problem but even then it was completely useless. In the end we felt that we wanted to leave as the hotel wasn't worth the price we were paying. It was a disappointing end to an 8 week holiday as we had hoped to have a bit of luxury at the end of our time on the road.

<Content>Loved the Hotel des Grandes Hommes Stayed for three days. The room was well appointed, the bathroom spacious. Our view was directly onto the Square and the Pantheon, well worth it. Breakfast was good. Staff very helpful, particularly the night staff on our last stay who rectified a discrepency with the bill. In fact my fifteen year old son remarked that that staff member had made the stay memorable. For a true Parisian stay this hotel beats any of the larger ones for position, feel and friendliness.

<Content>Awarded the three C's My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights - late December 2007, our first visit to Paris. Booking through the hotel's internet site is recommended for the best rate. From our experience we have awarded the Hotel des Grands Hommes the 3 C's for being charming, clean and comfortable, all that a traveller needs.Our arrival at the hotel was just before 9:00 am after a long flight from Brisbane, our first impression of the exterior and lobby was excellent. We were aware before arrival that we would not have access to our room until 2pm so were able to leave our luggage and return early in the afternoon to check in. As other reviews have stated the rooms are small (even the superior ones) but adequate with storage provided in a built in wardrobe with a safe. The bathroom was a good size with a large vanity and shower/bath tub, and of course all the necessary equipment - hairdryer, magnifying mirror and plenty of towels. Our room and the public areas of the Hotel were spotless, and the cleaning staff would always greet us if we met in the hallways.We opted to have breakfast in the Hotel as a croissant and coffee at a nearby cafe was 8 Euros each, and McDonalds is out of the question. A plentiful supply of coffee, fresh pastries, muesli, yoghurt, fruit, toast and toppings for 12 Euros was good value, and served by welcoming staff in a charming room. The front desk staff were proficient, but lacked warmth - no friendly conversation, at times we felt as though we were a nuisance, as they were busy and seemed unapproachable, so we only had contact with them on check in and departure. We did ask at check in - for recommendations for organised tours of Paris, but I felt that I knew more about what was available than the Clerk. Improvements - the reception staff could be more informative regarding Paris and the facilities within the hotel and understanding guests needs. For example on departure we discovered that there were powder rooms in the lobby, these would have been wonderful to use when we arrived at 9:00 am directly from 30 hours of travel. It would have been bliss to groom ourselves and redress to add a warmer layer of clothing. Overall we had a pleasant stay, with the hotel meeting our expectations for the price paid but not surpassing them.

Breakfast was sufficient with diffrent alternatives, breakfast room could be moved from the cellar to the ground floor. Great location next to the Panth茅on, nearest metro station if you head for the West of Paris requires some walking.

<Content>Lovely star in a fantastic city We have recently had a lovely long weekend and throughly enjoyed our stay at this charming hotel. Whilst not top end luxury this hotel was a haven after a long day walking. It was very clean and tidy compared to some other 3* hotels we saw around the city and the staff were very accomodating. The rooms were of a decent size with good view out of the window ! It is located just nicely outside the latin quarter -(2min walk away) and a also a 2 min walk away from the nearest metro station (luxembourg).The breakfast in the hotel is pricey at 12 euros each but would recommending eating instead in one of the cafes nearby or even McDonalds at end of road at it is very cheap at 2euro for coffee and an egg mcmuffin ! Unless you have recently won the lottery try not to cross into the 6th arrondisement - the other side of the bvld de St- Micheal - as the cost of breakfast increases to almost 10 euros for the same thing as you would pay for 6 in the 5th arrondisement ! We found a fabulous little brassiere on the rue de ecoles (near the bvld de St Michael) called Brasserie Balzar. The waiters are very traditionally dressed as is the deco - the food was gorgeous and very reasonably priced. Much more traditional than your fondues etc that you will get on the tourist run !

<Content>Small but convenient Our room was seriously small and I was immediately disappointed. It was listed as a superior double and I can only imagine what size a normal double would of been! The air conditioning didn't work and so you had to have the balcony doors open which lead straight out on to a joint balcony. The decoration was 'interesting' and dated. The accommodation was however clean and convenient. The staff although not rude were not overly welcoming. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again as I did not consider it value for money.

<Content>Lovely! We stayed at this hotel for a week over Christmas 2007 and found it to be charming, very clean and very well run. It is centrally located in the Latin Quarter so we were able to walk to many museums and attractions during our stay.As you would expect in Paris, our room was very very small but beautifully furnished and extremely clean. The central heating worked very well. On our first night there was no hot water in the bathroom, although this was fixed the next day. Our room was at the back of the hotel facing the courtyard and was very quiet.The staff were very helpful with organising trips outside the city and with general directions. Valerie in particular was great!We used the laundry service which the hotel offers but found this to be exorbitantly priced. We would have avoided using this service if we had known the laundry bill would be so high.Overall we enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Stay at Grands Hommes We had a lovely stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes from 17 Dec - 20 Dec 2007. We booked a Christmas special on the hotel website for a family room, which was two separate rooms - one double and one twin. The double room was very small with spacious bathroom (we kept both our suitcases in the bathroom as there was no room in our bedroom). The twin room was larger with smaller bathroom. Both rooms were decorated beautifully and very clean. No views from our rooms but this didn't worry us as we were out all day anyway.We arrived at the hotel before 12 noon but our rooms were not ready as checkin time is 1.00pm. That was ok so we went off sightseeing for a few hours and arrived back at the hotel round 3.30pm to find our rooms were still not ready! We waited for over 30-40 minutes and finally one room was ready. The other room was ready another 30 minutes or so after that. This was a little inconvenient as we had arrived in Paris after a long flight from Hong Kong and were pretty tired and expected that the rooms would have been well and truly ready on our return from sightseeing.However, this is the only criticism we have of our stay at the Hotel des Grand Hommes - everything else was wonderful!The hotel is in a great location opposite the Pantheon, surrounded by lots of good cafes, restaurants, shops, internet cafes and about 7 minutes walk to Luxembourg Metro station. Beautiful back streets filled with interesting shops, pattiseries, cheese shops etc.The staff were good with Matthew on the front desk particularly helpful.Breakfast was included in our room rate and was served in the cellar of the hotel, which was a delightful little area! We had no problems getting seating for the 4 of us even though the room only has 7 or 8 tables. Breakfast was more than adequate with a selection of cereals, juices, fresh fruit, cheeses, sliced meats, fresh bread and croissants, coffee, tea etc.All in all, we had a lovely time at the Hotel des Grands Hommes and would definitely stay again!

<Content>Very Cozy, Great Value This visit to Paris was our fifth in four years. January is wonderful in Paris with fewer crowds and moderate weather. We stayed at the HGH for 8 nights in an interior room with no view. We chose the hotel for its location (5eme) and we liked our previous stay in the sister hotel, Hotel du Pantheon, next store. The price was wonderful. It included a simple breakfast of coffee, breads, jams and meat and cheese for about 120 euros/night.The rooms are beautifully furnished and the bathrooms are large with a nice tub. There is no coffee or tea maker in the room. The service was very polite and responsive. The first room that we were given was small even by Paris standards. They allowed us to move to a larger room the next day. The only detractions were that the room's wifi was painfully slow. You could take a shower and get dressed before a page might load. You might prefer to visit the internet cafe across the street. I would also note that they are making improvements to the hotel next store and the hardest working guy in France starts hammering at about 8AM. I would highly recommend this hotel for the moderately price conscious traveler who loves the 5eme. Great, affordable restaurants are everywhere and you are still close to the Seine and St Germain-de-Pres.

<Content>Quiet, Romantic and Serene This was a lovely, small, charming hotel located near the Pantheon and Sorbonne and a quick walk to the Luxembourg metro and Park. The room had long windows over looking the Pantheon, it was a retreat and beautiful place to rest , relax and retreat. Being a bath maven, I was delighted to relax in the large tub. There was a tiny bar in the hotel . But most charming of all, were the staff that worked the hotel. Everyone was warm, helpful, informative. One morning , still on US time,I had slept right through breakfast. One of the women who managed the hotel brought me breakfast to the room without being asked.The area is nicely out of the way from the hustle and bustle of Paris, but near wonderful areas in which to shop, walk and eat. Oh and the food the area near St Germaine is filled with fabulous food every where. Enjoy. Bon Appetit!

<Content>Great with a couple little snags After reading all the positive reviews on this hotel, my wife and I booked 4 nights for our recent first anniversary stay.All in all, the hotel was good, not great. I think it's easy to build up your expectations based on others' opinions/reviews, so maybe mine were a little inflated. I booked directly with the hotel, which was far and away the best price. Based on the price I paid, I was happy. If I had paid their standard rates, I would not have been.The two main problems I had were actually with the service, not the room. -We flew in via redeye. When I booked the hotel, I requested an early check-in, and was told they could not guarantee it, but would make every effort to have a room available as early as possible. When we arrived at 10, we were told to come back at 2. When we came back at 2, we were told the room had not been cleaned, but that they would 'do it right now', and we were told to sit and wait in the lobby, which we did - for 40 minutes, with no apology. This, in my opinion, is not acceptable. -The second and more serious problem was our returning to our room one afternoon to find the door propped open, and no housekeeper in sight. Apparently they had just left the door wide open after cleaning. My wife went down to the desk, and was told 'relax, our hotel is very safe'. While this may be true, it was a truly shocking response. Again, no understanding or apology. And I think it goes without saying that despite how safe or unsafe the hotel may be, there is at a minimum a privacy and respect issue, whereby a hotel should not leave a guest's room open. This seems like hotelier 101 to me, and really just basic common sense.Aside from those two issues, the staff was very courteous, and helpful. Some other general thoughts on the room (we booked a 'superior'):-As should be expected, the room was very small. If you have more than one large suitcase, you will have trouble storing it. We had to put ours under the desk to be able to walk around the bed.-The shower is insane, as is typical in europe. No curtain/door, so expect the floor to have half an inch of water when you're done. Get extra towels for the floor, or bring your flippers. -The bed was comfortable - we slept great here. No noise problems. - Location is great. Beautiful views of the Pantheon. Lots of restaurants nearby, but less of the elegant little places like you find around Saint Germain. Definitely feels more catered to students, as it should given the location. All in all, I would say the issues we had were probably unusual, and that as long as you know what you're getting, this hotel is very good. Just go into it expecting that it feels like the low end of the 3-star rating, and don't expect service to be excellent - just good.

<Content>HotelD Fantastique!!!! Me and my boyfriend just returned from a seven day stay in the hotel and have only amazing things to say about the hotel. Our little room on the sixth floor overlooking the little courtyard, was one of the most romantic places I have ever stayed at. The staff were exceptionally friendly, the service outstanding, the room gorgeous and clean, the location magnificent (literally in front of the Pantheon, steps away from the lively Rue de Mouffetard market, blocks from the Seine, and the Notre Dame cathedral, as well as the Luxemburg gardens). When you stepped out of the hotel and stood in front of the Pantheon you could see the Eiffel tower hovering in the distance. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying in Paris!!!THANKS Hotels des Grands Hommes for making us fall in love with Paris!

<Content>A lovely boutique hotel in Paris We have stayed many times at the Hotel du Pantheon which is part of the same hotel group and which we like very much. As the Hotel du Pantheon was undergoing some rennovation we decided to stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes. We were delighted with the service, particularly the friendliness and warmness of the staff. On New Year's Eve we found a lovely bottle of champagne in our room, which was an unexpected but very nice touch. The location is ideal for seeing all the nearby sites, and nothing can prepare you for seeing the Pantheon by night as you walk back to your hotel. Without question we would stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Great location Lovely hotel in a quiet location with stunning views of the Pantheon out of the bedroom window. The hotel had easy access to the nearby RER. In fact we found it very easy to get to all the main sights on foot, with the Ile de la Cite just 15-20 mins walk away. The room was a bit on the small size but was nicely decorated and perfectly adequate. The hotel staff were friendly, courteous and helpful and recommended a superb atmospheric restaurant called Le Coupe-Chou on the nearby rue de Lanneau which is one of the best that we have been to! Would suggest checking out the hotel's website as they offer the best prices and special offers we found - we booked early and got breakfast included in the low rate.

<Content>Impressed by interior decorating My husband and I wanted a romantic trip to Paris for a few days without children and wanted to stay at a central romantic not too expensive hotel. We found Hotel des Grands Hommes at the yellow pages and booked via the hotel's website at a very favorable price. The hotel lived up to our expectations. It was very centrally situated in the heart of the Latin Quarter and with a very impressive decorating. The rooms were not very big, but for at few days it was all we needed. However, I still do not understand why hotels in most countries still use blankets instead of duvets.All in all recommendable for a romantic weekend in Paris.

<Content>A Great Place to Stay A great little hotel ... the location is unbeatable, directly opposite the Pantheon and an easy walk to all the benefits of the Latin Quarter, Notre Dame etc. The people were very helpful and pleasant and the service excellent. The front desk staff were happy to book taxis or even make dinner reservations for local restaurants. The rooms are small but beautifully decorated, charming and clean, as is the entire hotel. Our room was on the front of the hotel and looked out on the Pantheon. It gave a very special feel to our stay. We didn't notice any problem from street noise ... it was very quiet through the night. There is no ironing facilities available in the rooms and you have to do your ironing on a fold-out ironing board in front of the lift doors outside the small downstairs breakfast room, so its not ideal. However, we would definitely stay there again. If you accept that it is a small hotel, no dining etc. other than breakfast and think in those terms, it is a wonderful place to stay.Tony Hill

<Content>Lovely little hotel The Hotel des Grands Hommes, which has a historic pedigree from the surrealist era, is a lovely little hotel in the Latin Quarter. It faces the Pantheon (the great men of the hotel's name) and is in easy walking distance to the Luxembourg Gardens and various Left Bank sights, including the Musee du Luxembourg, the cafes of St. Germain, and Le Bon Marche.The rooms are charming, but very small. With a queen-sized bed in the room, there was barely enough space to move around. The staff was exceptionally helpful. We got a good rate via the hotel's website, but breakfast was 11 euros extra. Instead, we got breakfast at one of the cafes nearby at Place Edmond Rostand/Boulvevard St. Michel.The HGH is very close to the RER (line B, which goes to the airport), but it is a pretty good walk to a regular Metro station.

<Content>C'est fanastique! Well, this hotel was really fantastic. From entering the hotel to leaving 4 days later, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.The reception staff were extremely helpful, spoke fantastic English and humoured us through our poor French (rather than making us feel silly for trying!) and assisted us with everything we needed. The room was lovely- tres Parisienne, and they had put us in a room with a balcony in front of the Pantheon and two sets of double doors opening out. They had also left some sweets and a note in our room wishing us a happy anniversary. The street is a bit noisy through the night but it shouldn't bother you too much if you're used to city living. The location was great. Close to many restaurants (some of which were really good) and shops, nice and quiet at night and we felt very safe. A few really good underground cocktail bars as well. Very quick walk to the Seine (ten minutes?) and good metro access (closest station was Luxembourg where you can take line B direct to and from CDG airport in about 30 min).Only negatives were that the pillows were quite uncomfortable, and we found the room really hot. It appeared that the heating was underfloor as there were no radiators, and the dial on the wall said it was on the lowest. So it was quite hot throughout the evening when trying to sleep.We didn't try the breakfast, as 12 euros is quite a lot, but the breakfast room was really lovely. We would definately stay there again- that balcony would be lovely in summer.

<Content>Nice hotel and great location. My boyfriend and I went to Paris for my birthday weekend and really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes. It's in a great location with beautiful views of the Pantheon and less than 10mins walk from the Notre Dame. (Its also very easy to get to if you are travelling from London by Eurostar)The hotels decor is very unique keeping in style with its location. Our room was very clean and extremely quiet at night. We found the staff friendly and they also spoke excellent English. There are plenty of bars/cafes/restaurants in the locality. For a really nice meal reasonably priced there is a lovely French restaurant closeby called Le Vin Qui Danse.We booked through the Hotels own website which worked out cheaper than some of the general websites as they offer some good direct online reductions. Overall we had a fantastic time in Paris and would definetly recommend this hotel!

Only tiny negative point was that the room was on the ground floor. But the room itself was really really nice - and the bathroom was the cleanest hotel bathroom I have ever had the pleasure of using. All in all a terrific stay and I would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Lived up to expectations Spent 4 nights last week in Hotel des Hommes. Lovely boutique style hotel. Spotlessly clean with fresh linen on the bed every day. Ideal location, handy for Notre Dame, Louvre, Musee D'Orsay and strolling alongside the Seine. Quiet at night but still close to restaurants bars etc. Despite our advancing years, we liked the buzz of Sorbonne students in the area. Far superior to the retirement home feel of some places. Paris is great. In general people were friendly especially staff at the reception in the hotel. We found the best value and range of restaurants on the Rue Moueftard/Descartes. Go right as you exit the hotel and its about 5 minutes walk. For the price it would be hard to find a better hotel in Paris. Will definitely return.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We have just arrived from our week in Paris. Following Tripadvisor reviews I've booked at Hotel des Grand Hommes, directly from their site. The hotel is WONDERFUL. Never mind the small rooms - they are so nicely decorated, clean and functional that you don't need more. The neighborhood is very good, walk distance from Ile de la cite and RER station nearby. The staff is very helpful and the breakfast all what you need. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel but an uphill walk from the Metro We recently stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes for 2 nights, Nov. 19-21. We booked directly with the hotel, several months in advance. We got their Internet Rate and pre-paid in full 353 Euros for a deluxe double room with a view of the Pantheon for 2 nights, not including breakfast.Everything the other reviewers have said about this hotel is true. The Hotel des Grands Hommes is a smart, stylish hotel on a grand piazza facing the Pantheon and has beautiful decor, nice clean bathrooms, lovely downstairs lobby, helpful and efficient staff, etc.. Our balcony looked directly onto the Pantheon and was stunning. The traffic noise was not bad at all. I really loved the hotel but feel that it is important to note for future travelers that the hotel is uphill from the nearest Metro stop - about 15 minutes away. If you are European and used to walking so much, well ok. But the average American (like me) may not be and after walking around Paris all day, it was a bit exhausting to emerge from the Metro and then face an uphill walk to the Hotel des Grands Hommes. Frankly, at the end of the day, my feet were tired and it was generally dark, cold and drizzling rain and the last thing I wanted to do was trudge up that hill again, past the Sorbonne with all the student- types loitering about. As much as I loved this hotel's decor, etc... I think that for my next visit to Paris, I might rather stay somewhere a bit closer to the Seine and a Metro stop- such as the Hotel Louis II (newly renovated and about 100 ft. from the Odeon Metro stop).

<Content>Superb experience at Hotel des Grands Hommes Cannot fault our recent stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes. Polite efficient reception staff, superb room (v. quiet) with views of the Pantheon across the street and Sacre Coeur in the distance from the floor to ceiling windows. Bathroom in need of a slight modernisation, but that would be a minor quibble. Great location if you want something a little less frantic than staying in the Marais, with romantic walks at your doorstep across the Jardins de Luxembourg and down to Isle de la Cite. Would stay again without doubt (please note we only didn't see any other rooms apart from the one we had and therefore cannot comment on this aspect of the hotel).

<Content>Stay here regularly when in Paris. Like the Quartier, love the view. Always enjoy staying in this hotel. It has a quirky French character which is perfect for a stay in Paris. the staff are always helpful. The rooms are compact and the ones at the back not very well lit, but they have everything you need for a short stay. The front rooms with have a great view over the Pantheon. don't expect 24 h room service, and the breakfast is French rather than international style. The cave where you eat is an interesting experience, and it can get a little crowded at times, but the coffee is excellent.

<Content>Wouldn't go anywhere else! SHORT REVIEW:Tasteful and charming clean, fresh bedrooms; no tattiness to be seen; unique decor; spotless bathroom; good water pressure; good hairdrier; fresh towels everyday and toiletries; minibar; room safe; BBC world; tidy and attractively furnished reception; polite staff; good location (not touristy); freshly served and presented brekkie; lots of bars, brasseries, cafes etc in immediate vicinity; taxi, metro and RER within 3 mins stroll; would stay here again without hesitation. Absolutely no faults - and I can find them if I have to. 10/10 for everything. A management team and support staff that should be very proud of themselves. Superior 3* hotel.LONG REVIEW:Part of the fun for me when going away for a break is to research my hotels, and I tend to use the Trip Advisor website as my first port of call to get a general feel. And I am glad to report that again, the write ups this hotel received do truly reflect it.We stayed 3 nights from 28 Nov - 1 Dec 07 inclusive, and stayed in room 54 which was unfortunately - and I would like to strongly emphasise it was the only down side to our stay here - at the back of the hotel. Hence, no view of the Pantheon! :-(We reserved some months ago via the website directly and got a good deal which included breakfast each morning.HOTELThe building is very pretty and faces straight onto the Pantheon. The Hotel Pantheon (part of the same chain) is right next door. Reception is tastefully furnished and check in desk discreetly tucked away to the left. Staff very curtuous, efficient and helpful.Our room was on the 5th floor. OK - it was small but we didn't care. Size isn't everything just so long as it is clean, comfortable and pleasant on the eye. And that it was - tasteful, clean, crisp and fresh as was the bathroom also. Loved the light fixtures by the bed. Plenty of toiletries and fresh towels each day. Bed was super comfy, windows could be opened for air in both room and bathroom, adjustable thermostat, mini bar was well stocked (bit expensive though - half bottle of champagne was a cracking 24E!!), and there was also a safe and a hairdrier. TV had BBC world. Without a shadow of a doubt, this has got to be the cleanest hotel I have every stayed at. Each morning when heading for breakfast, the corridors were a hive of activity with the maids setting about their business - and the entire establishment reflects this.BREAKFASTAs we had the brekkie included, we actually only had breakfast on 2 of the 3 mornings there (had a lie in on the Saturday and so missed the 10.30 cut off). The breakfast room is in the basement which is sooo cute. Cavernous. Although on the small side, it did surprisingly always seem to have at least a table free for the new arrivals. You could help yourself to juice, cereal, fruit, yogurts, toast, jam/butter, dried fruit, 3 types of cheese and 3 types of salami/ham. Once seated the waitress would bring you a basket of fresh baguette, hazlenut bread, mini croissants and pain au chocolate. If you wanted anything such as omlette or eggs, you could have but there was an additional charge (on average 2-4 euro per item ordered). To be honest, what they offered as standard was already absolutely fine. LOCATIONGreat location. We actually walked everywhere whilst in Paris - so much that I don't think we got the full value of the Carte Visite Paris which we bought and is mentioned below. Anyhow, it's a 5 mins stroll down to Notre Dame from the Hotel, and from there if you walk along the bank of the Seine, you can get to the Eiffel Tower or Arc de Triomph (at a leisurely pace) in about 45 mins. Obviously, if you stop off at the attractions in between (Louvre, musee Dorsay, etc it will take longer).EAT AND DRINK NEARBYNear the hotel there are indeed lots of bars, cafes, brasseries and restaurants - including a McDonalds and Quick fast food outlet if you are that way inclined. Also within the immediate vicinity is a pharmacy (which I needed on Saturday morning - ahem, to go along with the medicinal lie in!!). Just thought I'd mention it. As you are only a 5 mins walk to the Latin Quarter and St. Severine, you MUST go there at night as there are simply lots to choose from. Look for Cafe Rim - Italian - which was very popular the night we were there with groups waiting up to 20 mins for a table. Good sign. But all in all, there are so many places, it's hard to choose. One thing I noticed - lots of Savoie restaurants serving cheese fondue!!! TO GET THEREWhen we arrived at CdG airport (terminal 3) we took a short walk over to the train station which was in another terminal. Literally 5 mins walk. There we bought the Carte Paris Visite ticket which opens the doors to the whole Ile-de-France network : Metro, RER, Buses, Trams, SNCF overland suburban trains, the Montmartre funicular, Montmartobus, Noctilien and the Optile bus network - depending on the zones you choose of course (Zone 1 to Zone 3 or Zone 1 to Zone 6). You can buy it for either 1,2,3 or 5 days. We bought it for 3 days and for Zone 1-6 as CdG airport falls into Zone 5. The price was 38.50E but obviously the price will vary depending on exactly which one you opt for. As mentioned above, we walked everywhere so I don't think we got the full value - but not to mind. FYI a one-way ticket CdG-Luxembourg is 8.20E. There is also a taxi rank outside Quick fast food.++ At the moment, there is a big wheel located at the place de la Concorde so at early dusk it's an idea to make your way there for a quick ride on it with a bag of warm churros to keep your hands warm!

<Content>Superb Experience Our stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes was absolutely wonderful. It had been several years since I visited Paris, and I was cautiously trying to find a hotel with comfort and charm at a (relatively) reasonable rate.The room was a typical size for a European hotel, but the terrace overlooking the square below was a surprise. We enjoyed a bottle of wine (maybe two...) sitting outside our room in the evenings.The room itself was comfortable, although the closet space was limited. The bathroom wasn't big, but very clean. It surprised us that sound from the television was piped into speakers in the bathroom. It wasn't bothersome, just something we hadn't seen before.The view from our room was spectacular. Waking up in the night to see the lit up dome of the Pantheon outside is an experience I won't forget. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Magnifique! Our first visit to Paris. I had googled lots of 3 and 4 star hotels - knew we wanted to be on the Left Bank and found this place. Checked it out through Trip Advisor and it had good to great reviews across the board - price was reasonable and we could get a double room with a view of the Pantheon - it was near the Metro and the Morais, the Seine etc.We got there at 7 a.m. - our flight got in very early. The conciierge was very nice, held our bags and went over a few things including good directions to all the places we wanted to see.Our room was pretty, sheets fantastic, bed firm, nice pillows, good towels and a had a bathtub!! A big plus for us.This is a totally no smoking hotel also a very big plus for us.The only negative or the only suggestion I would make that would bring me back would be to include a simple breakfast - cafe cr猫me and a roll - maybe some fruit - that's it. Every other three and four star hotel we stayed in France and Italy offered that. I was surprised a breakfast would cost 12 euros. We went out every morning and had a cafe cr猫me and a roll at some neighborhood cafe but NONE were no smoking - we sat outside - slightly bundled - it was about 50 degrees.All in all a great place and a great location.Very pretty accommodations.thanks to all staff who made our stay pleasant!

<Content>Romantic little hotel Romantic getaway for me and my girlfriend. Stayed four nights at the hotel, booked through the hotels own website after reading the reviews on tripadvisor - saved around 100 Euros compared to the cheepest booking agent (hotels.com). How was the hotel: Great loction located 50 meters from the Pantheon in the Latin quarters. We came from Orly, and the railroadstop was just 5 minutes walk from the hotel.Check in was smooth, ok english, greated with a smile. Lobby is small, but nice and clean. Room was small, the bed a little bit hard, but ok size. Minibar and safe, window to the backyard. Bathroom was clean and nice, spaceous compared to the bedroom, bathtub. Quiet, and slept well. Had breakfast the last day, was ok, coffee/tea, toast, a few cheeses and salami/ham (Euro 12 per person). We usually got up around 10 and ate great breakfast on different corner cafe's (usually around 8 euro for french breakfast).What to do in Paris:We bought the Paris card for 5 days (buy it at the airport) and you have cheap transportation for the rest of your holiday, and it was nice to not have to pay everytime you took the metro, which you do a lot to save your legs :). We went to Louvre (closed on tuesdays), Eiffel tower, Sacre cur, Triumph Arch, champse E., versailles, Montmartre (was a big disappointment - looked like a getto with a lot of gangs going a round, felt unsafe compred to the latin quarters) and took an evening dinner criuse at the river seine - expensive but definetively worth it,Beateux Parisiene, booked at the office close to the eiffel tower - 125 E per person,(95,125,180 E dependent on service) great dinner, had snails for starter, wasn't bad, 745 pm - 11 pm), versailles (went there with local train covered by Paris card, located just 5-10 minutes walk) and just walked around. We found the Latin Quarters were the hotel is located to be the niceste part of town, a lot of cafe's, bars, restaurant and it seemed very safe!Have a nice stay in Paris and i would definetively recommend the above mentioned hotel and the Lain quarters.

The room was immmaculately clean and beautifully decorated, with a very comfortable bed and fluffy pillows. The staff was first-rate and always helpful with directions and assistance making dinner reservations. We booked early and prepaid the first night, so it was an excellent value. Its a terrific neighborhood, close to the Luxembourg Gardens. There was some noise from carousers at the nearby plaza of the Pantheon one early morning.

<Content>Loved this gorgeous little hotel .. Stayed in this lovely hotel for three nights, got a great deal on the hotels own website .. by booking online in June and paying up front we paid 鈧?00 for three nights, double room with ensuite. Although we did not have a balcony or view of the Pantheon we did have a nice sized room (maybe small by American standards but more than adequate) with a huge bathroom. It was beautifully decorated and always really warm and cosy. The reception staff were very nice and helpful even looking up website for us when we enquired about the bus tours and going to Disney (which was great fun worth a visit for children and adults alike also booked online for a better ticket price). The hotel is within easy reach of the Luxembourg RER station, the Notre Dame is lovely walk and there are various shops and restaurants around the area. I would highly recommend this hotel for a romantic break away in a beautiful city

<Content>Great Location We were celebrating our 25th anniversary and were advised by friends to stay in the Latin Quarter. First time in Paris. Read reviews on tripadvisor and decided to stay here. Very nice, clean hotel in a great location. Felt very safe walking in the area and we had every dinner within walking distance of the hotel. Excellent choice of restaurants (make reservations) nearby, so why travel? It was great being able to walk to the restaurant, have delicious wine and have a leisurely stroll back to the hotel. Our dinner was our evening entertainment - 2-3 hours because one was never rushed. People at front desk gave excellent recommendations, but a Paris Zagat's book was VERY helpful. Le Petit Pontoise was our most delicious meal. We were seated next to a retired chef that said, This is the way French food tasted 20 years ago and this is the way it should taste. Train stops nearby, but be prepared to do a lot of walking. Pick up Paris City Walks at a bookstore. It gives one EXCELLENT walks in different areas of Paris. Paris is the most beautiful city we've been too. We were there for 8 nights and it was not enough time!

Hard to fault, great location, lovely decor in keeping with the lovely old building and very clean and quiet. Very helpful and courteous staff, particularly the front desk. Nice rooms with relatively spacious bathroom. Like most older continental hotels the bedroom was a little small but a minor problem compared with the overall experience. Would be my first choice next time.

<Content>Wonderful Honeymoon Spent a magical 5 days in Paris at the Hotel des Grands Hommes on our honeymoon.This was my first stay in Paris and I'm hooked - looking forward to spending many anniversaries there.We stayed in room 22 overlooking the Pantheon - the room was beautifully decorated and a great view! The hotel is in a great location and I would recommend it to anybody. Only one disappointment during our stay which was dinner on the bateau mouche - nice trip but very average food and definitely not worth the money.There are plenty of good restaurants close to the hotel - take your pick.

<Content>Excellent Location Beautifully decorated room, although compact in the manner of all central Paris small hotels, good bathroom. Excellent vista over Place du Pantheon from front of building rooms, close to RER line from CDG. Very good neighbourhood adjacent to Luxembourg Gardens, plenty restaurants, good walking. All-in-all, an ideal location for a short-break holiday in Paris.

The staff responding to my request were very helpful - particularly since they seemed very happy to correspond in English. The hotel itself is in a great location, handy for all of the delights of the left bank and an easy walk to a number of the big attractions. The room was spotless and well appointed, with very comfortable beds. Would definitely stay again.

<Content>Excellent stay - brilliant location! Very comfortable hotel with excellent location. The rooms were clean and comfortable, if not particularly large. The bathroom was just fine. The bed very comfortable. The best thing about the hotel is without a doubt the location - get a room with a view of the Pantheon - superb! Also within walking distance of many of the main attractions. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Hotel Grands Hommes - Excellent Location and Nice Hotel The hotel is very well situated across the square from the Pantheon and with easy access to the main sites of Paris by foot such as Notre Dame. This proved invaluable as our stay coincided with a nationwide transport strike!The room that we had was not large but it was very comfortable and nicely decorated. A nice touch was the turn down service each evening which we hadn't expected.The staff were very welcoming and quick to sort out a minor problem that we had with the television not working properly.A continental breakfast was included in the room rate and again was good with a nice selection of fresh breads and croissants brought to the table by the friendly waitress.I would certainly recommend this hotel and am looking forward to staying there again on my next trip to Paris!

<Content>Wonderful! (with a very few exceptions!) We had a wonderfully romantic stay at The Hotel Grands Hommes. The view from our balcony was magnificent and worth every euro to be able to sit there with a bottle of wine in the evening and gaze across Paris to Montmarte watching the twinkling lights of the city appear. We adore stayng in the Latin Quarter and this hotel is ideal...The staff was very polite and helpful and made us feel welcome. It was peacful and quiet at night enough to leave our windows wide open ....until...Friday night...when every student (as students do) decided to party like it was 1999 in the Patheon Square. It rocked LOUDLY until about 3 morning which made it really rough since we had a 8 o'clock flight to Rome. It was too warm to close the windows entirely so all in all it was not a great night. So...our advise is DO stay at this hotel just try and stay during the week...or stay on the weekend and go out and party like a rock star.

<Content>Overall Good Choice - A Few Details Would Make it Great My partner and I just came back from our first trip to London and Paris and had a particularly great time in Paris. The Grands Hommes location was terrific and the view of the Pantheon was the icing on the cake. Staff were friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. I saw another review mention the poor TV and towels - this was our biggest quibble. Upgrading both would be a relatively inexpensive way to take the hotel up a notch. Satellite TV was not what it promoted. I'm surprised the hotel didn't offer pay TV (not that you want to spend hours in your hotel room but the option of curling up with a movie and a bottle of wine can be appealing!). The lobby was odd in that they make it not welcoming to spend any time in it by piling up a barrier/mish mash of furniture. Not a great welcoming or very appealing. Overall, we were happy with our choice which was done after hours of Tripadvisor and other web reviews.

Manager made special effort to change our room to one that suited us more.Great location, though not near metro line to most sites. Beautiful Luxembourg Gardens nearby as well as many nice restaurants. Despite location at Pantheon, very little automobile traffic at night. Breakfast room a bit cramped so prefered local spots for light continental breakfast.

We had a nice room on the 5th floor with a balcony and a view.Above all we appreciated the hotel staff. Special mention for the front desk, professional and friendly. Even more special mention for the breakfast maitre d'hotel. She went out of her way to make the breakfast a very pleasant moment and she greeted us everyday with her bonne humeur.Will definitely return and recommend.

<Content>Good Choice for Paris We stayed at the Grands Hommes in September, for 6 nights. This was our first trip to Paris. The location in the Latin Quarter is excellent, right across the street from the Pantheon. Easy access (three blocks) to the RER B, for quick travel to anywhere in Paris on the excellent subway system. No need for a cab. Felt safe in the neighborhood at all times, and we were out late every night. Our hotel room was the size of a college dorm room, but the shower was always hot, the air conditioning always worked, and we could not hear our neighbors. We took the stairs down in the morning, and rode the elevator up at night. We did not need help from the staff as we planned most of our events on our own. We also are foodies, and made our own dinner reservations, including at Le Trufferie (a 5 minute walk from the hotel), Le Train Bleu, and Guy Savoy. Notre Dame is a short walk away. We also walked to the Louvre, Orsay, and all of the other big ones. We picked this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor, and can easily recommend it. We did not do the hotel breakfast, as we are believers in getting out and eating at the patisseries and other shops along the way. Cheese stores and wine stores are close, as is an excellent crepe shop -- Crepes a go-go. We would buy champagne on way back to hotel prior to dinner and have a few glasses in the room. Staff was very friendly, and spoke english. We spent a few months learning some basic french before we traveled, and highly recommend doing the same. We would stay here again.

<Content>Still a great option in Paris We've stayed here before... and we came back, which I guess is a recommendation in itself. A great location - in the heart of the Latin Quarter - very quiet but surrounded by lots of bars and restaurants. Very good access to Gare du Nord and the Eurostar - just 3 stops on the RER (door to door in 25 mins). Nice, cosy and clean rooms, good service and an adequate breakfast. My only concern is that the room rates seem to be creaping up...

<Content>Excellent value for the money We are so grateful we booked the Hotel des Grands Hommes for 16 days in August for the following reasons:1. Location: walking distance to the heart of the city, 5 minutes to the Metro; local neighbourhood was charming and romantic. Le Berthaud was our favourite restaurant: authenic cuisine, supported by locals, reasonable (15.5 eu for 2 courses) and 3 blocks away.2. Price - the hotel website was the best deal; the staff we very prompt and courteous in describing various options; we decided that breakfast included was better than an early-bird discount.3. Breakfast - small, but very adequate cold buffet. We might have found a better value outside the hotel, but the convenience, bottomless cups of coffee and Marika's warm and cheery welcome made this a far better option.4. Staff - always friendly, approachable, accommodating and helpful5. Accommodation - rooms were small but immaculate; the ensuite was pristine. We stayed in a standard interior room which had no view but was quiet. We stayed in a superior room (extra 30 euros) which had a spectacular view but could be noisy into the early morning hourd if we left the window opened. Both rooms neded more shelving for clothing. 6. Cable TV - BBC and CNN kept us informed. There were other stations in Italian, German, Spanish and French. TV size was not an issue.7. Free WIFI - we brought our laptop; the internet connection was perfect. A convenient way to keep in touch with family, local news back home, to store photos, to confirm attraction information, etc. Local internet cafes were 4 eu/hr.8. Cheap telephone - 10 Euro cents per minute to North America; direct dial9. Access to airport - we took RER commuter train to hotel for 8 euros; the stop was a 10 minute walk to the hotel; We took Parishuttle back to the airport (19 eu/pp) since the escalators from streetlevel only went up and it was rush hour. The staff booked the shuttle for us.10, Air conditioning: a luxury in the summer and not common in ParisWe definitely hope to return.

<Content>A Room With a View - But Could Use Some Improvement The best thing about this hotel is its location. The view out the front is sensational - a stunning view of the Pantheon. Get a room with a terrace, if you can. That being said, the hotel could use some improvement. The room rate is steep, but these are not luxury accommodations. The bath towels were really thin and not what I am used to. Also, we had to ask for extra towels every night, as the two they gave us were not sufficient. We also had to ask for extra blankets - it was chilly and they only provided a thin coverlet. The TV was antiquated - a tiny tube model mounted high and barely visible- most hotels now provide flat screen TV's. No clock radio was provided - and none was available when we asked, which we thought was rather lame. The rugs in the hallway are somewhat worn and look shabby. Still, the rate was 270 Euros a night.Breakfast is not included in the room rate. A fairly modest breakfast here costs 12 Euros per person - a rip-off in my opinion. You are better off going to a local cafe. I remember the days not so long ago when small hotels always included a complimentary breakfast - but not here. You cannot even get a complimentary cup of coffee here - that costs 2 Euros per person. Very chintzy, in my opinion.

<Content>Great location Excellent location right next to the Pantheon, Sorbonne, Latin Quarter and only a few blocks from Luxembourg RER (metro line to CDG airport). Walking distance to Notre Dame. We asked for a room on the 5th floor with a balcony and got one along with a nice email welcoming us. The rooms on the 5th floor have small balconies and the ones on the top (6th) floor have larger balconies.Staff is friendly and helpful, free Wi-Fi internet, very good breakfast. I usually don't go for hotel breakfasts but I recommend this one.Room was clean, comfortable, and not noisy despite the fact that we overlooked Place du Pantheon.Good value given the location.

<Content>Great location to see all the best of Paris. The Hotel des Grands Homme offered the perfect location for a great price. The hotel is very clean and the staff is very helpful and they all speak English; and since most Americans don't speak the lovely French language this is a plus. I did experience one small minor incident with breakage and the management was very courteous and handled the situation appropriately. I highly recommend this hotel for tourists who are in Paris to see the sites and not just hang around and lounge in their hotel room. The metro stop and the beautiful Luxembourg Gardens are three blocks away, the 24 hour internet store is two blocks away and there are numerous shops on the Avenue Sofflot. Enjoy beautiful Paris and I recommend the Hotel des Grands Hommes as your home base.

You should try and get a room that faces the Pantheon -- our room faced the back of the hotel (other apartments) which wasn't bad but we didn't have a view, that's all.The bed was comfortable, the room clean and the linens were very nice. The room was small but it did have a mini-fridge in it. (Plus who spends a lot of time in the room!)Some of the staff seemed rather cool (by American standards) but they were helpful when asked. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>My new favourite hotel in Paris! I visit Paris for business 3 or 4 times a year and this was my first time staying at Hotel des Grands Hommes. I chose it based on reviews on Trip Advisor, its location close to Jardins de Luxembourg (a beautiful spot in Paris for a Saturday morning stroll) and its convenience for getting to the airport (it is very close to the RER station Luxembourg which is on the airport line). The rates were very good on the hotel's website (summer special). If you can get this hotel at a good price I would defintely recommend it. The rooms are a good size (for Paris) - beuatifully decorated (completely over the top but very stylish and comfortable). The rooms at the front overlook the Pantheon - a little noisy on the Friday night I stayed there but it didn't last too late and so sleeping wasn't a problem. The breakfast (鈧?2) was very good - a good selection of cold meats, cheese, bread, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, juice and tea/coffee. The staff were polite and helpful. I have a new favourite hotel in Paris!

<Content>Room with a view! I booked directly with the hotel and got a package which included breakfast,and a stay in a superior room with a small balcony which looked out right onto the Pantheon. The room was nicely decorated, very clean and had very good and easily controlled air conditioning. The room was an adequate size but they should think about adding some drawers into the closet space and maybe some shelving in the bathroom - there wasn't room for both my own any my partners toilletries around the sink area.The overhead shower was rather weak but the hand held one had good pressure and there was always plenty of hot water.As I mentioned our package included breakfast. This was served in a small but pleasantly cave like room in the basement of the hotel. I really can't recommend the food served however. There was a really limited choice on offer - no hot food unless you were willing to pay 4 euros for an omelette or 2 euros for a boiled egg!We were given a basket of bread and pastries each morning with a choice of a couple of cold meats/cheeses etc buffet style but overall you would be far better eating outside. They should either scrap the breakfast option or give you a better selection.The staff were always very pleasant and helpful and the hotel is in a lovely and surprisngly quiet location with easy access to various metro stops within a 10 minute walk. There are lots of nice cafes and restaurants nearby and I would recommend trying some of these rather than walking down to others on the main streets such as Boulevard St. Michel and St. Germain. Overall we really enjoyed out stay - just don't book breakfast.

<Content>The perfect way to enjoy Paris This hotel has quite a bit going for it even before you consider the staff and rooms: it is right in the heart of the University quarter of Paris, on the site of Mont Saint Genevieve, where Abelard opened his first school and the first King of the Franks was buried (the remains of the church across the square); the Pantheon is outside - a remarkable piece of architecture, whose classical beauty is enhanced by it history (a church which was later converted by the humanist revolutionaries into a humanist cathedral after the revolution); the Sorbonne Law school (ecole de droit) sits majectically at the entrance to the square; and the Luxembourg Gardens are at the end of the street! A brief (all too brief, as the area really is so pleasing on the eye)walk of 5 minutes down from the mount brings you into what is left of the bustling medieval heart of Paris, with its narrow lanes and Roman ruins incorporated into medieval palaces (Hotel du Cluny - you must visit the musee du Moyen age inside: magnificent). There are some great eateries here (Balzar, as one reviewer has already highlighted, is great - try the rum baba; they drown it in St Martinique rum, then leave you the full bottle just in case you want more! And don't start me of the steak and frittes) and also some really tasty eastern mediterrenean takeaways which can be eaten while walking past statues of Charlemagne on the way to Notre Dame and the Louvre (I could sit in there and look at Delacroix's paintings for a year and a day). The train (Luxembourg) to both PCDG airport and Orly is right next to the hotel. This was perfect for us as we flew into CDG from Edinburgh and out of Orly to Avignon.No taxis, no rip-off, no 'scenic' detours. Brilliant.The hotel itself is realy, really good value for money. We stayed in some very expensive hotels in Southern France, but not one of them could compete with the view we had out of our room. The hotel gave us the central room with the large balcony which looked straight onto both the Pantheon and Sorbonne in the background. We drank Reinhart champgne on the balcony while watching everyone coming and going from the Pantheon and the Luxembourg gardens (connected to the Pantheon by a beautiful street which the Pantheon dominates). The rooms were very tastefully decorated. Classical motifs swirling on the felted walls, with wooden beams elegantly holdng up the roof. The bed was comfy and spacious. The room itself was typically (Parisian) compact, but not obtrusively so. The staff were helpful and friendly (chatty even at 6 in the morning as we flew off to Provence).On behalf of my wife and I, I want to thank the staff and the owners at the Grands Hommes for ensuring the first few days of our honeymoon were so memorable. Your hotel is everything that a Parisien hotel should be: friendly, warm, beautiful to look at, and, above all, classy.We will be back. Keep our room free for our 1st wedding anniversary next 4th of August.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We're just back from a 7-night stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes - it was fantastic! The location of the hotel is great, with lots of cafes and bars close by, and it's within easy walking distance of the Seine and the major attractions. It's also just across the road from the Luxembourg Gardens if you're a jogger like my husband! We stayed in room 31 - although it wasn't huge, it was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean and had double windows opening out to the most amazing view of the Pantheon (even better at night when it's floodlit!). The hotel staff were all very polite and helpful, and the maid (they never normally get mentioned, do they?) kept our room spotless, and left us a chocolate on our pillow every day - a nice touch! Breakfast is served until 10.30am, which makes for a nice leisurely start to the day. We'll definitely stay here again - hopefully sooner rather than later! During our stay, our favourite day was when we did the Segway Tour (booked with Fat Tire Tours: http://www.citysegwaytours.com/paris/ ) which we'd also come across on Trip Advisor. It was fantastic fun - you really should give it a go! You'll get used to the Segway very quickly and it's the most amazing way of getting around the city - and attracting some odd looks from passers-by! We also very much enjoyed the dinner cruise on the Bateaux Mouches - another lovely way of seeing the city.

<Content>lovely hotel,great value The hotel is right in the 5th arrondissement in Place du Pantheon. What a lovely view! Our family of 6 had three rooms. Two on the the 5th and one on the 3rd. All three rooms overlooked the courtyard. The bathrooms were terrific and the beds and linens most comfortable. One of the bathrooms was quite spacious and even had a large window. The breakfast was quite good and varied but at 12 euro each was too expensive for us. We ate there on the first morning only. The hotel is very near a major metro station. The lobby looked very well kept and the staff was helpful and friendly. The elevator and hallway are a bit tight when you have large luggage. The online rate was great [110 euro] compared to other comparable hotels. I would certainly go back ----probably as an anniversary trip just with my husband [I'd ask for a larger room overlooking the Pantheon--unfortunately,cost would most assuredly be higher].Carmelanna from Toronto in Canada

<Content>Perfect Hotel, Perfect Location We have just returned from 5 nights/6 days staying at des Grands Hommes. It was everything we hoped for. Our room (10)was, I understand, generous in Paris terms and had amazing views looking onto the Pantheon. The decor was beautiful too. Only one floor up, it was also surprisingly quiet. It was the most painfree check-in we've ever experienced and our room was ready early. The staff were all very corteous and helpful. The location of this hotel is superb - it's ideally situated for getting to everything. We even strolled back from the Eiffel Tower to the hotel one afternoon. We would recommend this hotel to anyone - especially couples as it really is the perfect spot for a romantic getaway. Go and enjoy!

<Content>Location, location, location The location adjoining The Pantheon makes this hotel ideal for a short stay in Paris. Very well equipped with above average furnishings and decoration. We went 'standard' for the price and the room was small but very tastefully furnished - large comfortable bed and great bathroom. Only drawback was our view over the inner courtyard rather than at the front overlooking the Pantheon. So for a little bit extra we would recommend you go 'superieure'. With a rack rate of 255 euros our rate of 96 euros through Tripadvisor represented very good value for money. And there are free Guardian newspapers in the foyer.

<Content>Nothing special Contrary to the numerous rave reviews, I am somewhate surprised at the popularity of this hotel after staying there for a couple of evenings.The service was impersonal with a different person at the front desk nearly everytime I walked past. The previous year I stayed at Eduard VII near l'Opera and found it much more charming, accomodating, with friendlier reception and service.

<Content>Loved the grand hommes We had a perfect romantic room with a view over the Pantheon. It was our first holiday with our 8 week old babygirl. We had a baby cot in our room and our baby slept like a rose. We would recommend this hotel it's in the Le Quartier Latin a vibrant area, nice restaurants and caf茅s. The beautiful Le jardin du Luxembourg is less then 10 minute walk. Free parking in August was a big surprise. Willemsens family, Amsterdam Holland

<Content>Beautiful Boutique Hotel - Snooty Staff We returned from Normandy to stay one last night in Paris before departing back to the States and chose to spend the night in a different area than we had stayed earlier in the week. The Hotel des Grandes Hommes was absolutely beautiful. We got a great deal on Expedia. My husband just about had a heartattack when he saw the posted rate but I assured him we were not paying that rate (I think we paid 118 Euros for the night - the posted rate started at 300 Euros). The only negative was the staff. They were very snooty and generally not very helpful - a big turnoff to a Southerner! Although we really enjoyed our stay, we loved the Rue Clear neighborhood more.

<Content>Excellent location, really friendly staff, lovely room. Perfect boutique hotel Though we travelled with our 16 month old daughter who cramped our style a little, we had a GREAT time in Paris staying at the Grand Homme. The location is perfect - quiet but just five mins to all the action and 3 mins to the Jardin de Luxembourg (a wonderful place to sit and chill) The staff at the hotel were all really friendly, polite and welcoming. The ambience was a perfect blend of intimate without being claustrophobic. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Love this hotel I got a room as a last-minute deal through the hotel's web site. Ended up with an absolutely beautiful room with a spectacular view of the Panth茅on. I've stayed at the hotel next door which is run by the same people and every time I've had an excellent experience. Very nice, clean facilities, romantic decor, pleasant and professional staff, central but quiet location. Would strongly recommend as long as the secret doesn't get out so I can't get a deal there anymore.

<Content>We HIGHLY recommend this hotel! Just back from a very pleasant stay at the HGH. First off, it is a 5-10 minute walk from the RER-B train line stop at Luxembourg, that is a direct shot to both Orly and Charles deGaulle airports. In a pretty, quiet-ish part of town but plenty to do around there. Lots of good cafes within a 5 minute radius. Easily walkable to many, many tourist spots. The room was very nice, clean and the bathroom was huge and immaculate. Fully updated. Good A/C. Friendly staff. Easy booking (with no problems) and best rate through the hotel's own website. We'd definitely go back there and would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Best Hotel in Paris I began staying at Hotel des Grands Hommes five years ago when I was traveling frequently to Paris for business. Its location near the RER B, Jardin du Luxembourg, and Institut Curie were of prime imporance for me at the time. Over the years, I have selected HGH exclusively as my hotel of choice in Paris. The hotel is extraordinarily beautiful both inside and out. The view from any room facing the Place du Pantheon is more than rewarding. One truly has the feeling of belonging to Paris. The decor in the guest rooms is perfect; welcoming and charming. The tastful furniture and appropriately matched wall coverings and bed linens all combine to make on feel warm, welcomed and relaxed. The attention and professional courtesy extended by the excellent staff add significantly to one's Parisan experience. Everyone from reception to breakfast service to housekeeping is friendly, competent and professional...eager to please.I have recommended Hotel des Grands Hommes to friends and family, and plan to visit in the Spring of 2008 with my teenage daughters, and my sister and her family. I truly love this hotel and everything about it. If possible ask for a room on the 5th or 6th floors with a balcony and a view of Notre-Dame.

<Content>Perfect location I had a wonderful room overlooking the Pantheon. The room was a little small but fine for one person, and the surprize was the bathroom, which was huge even by US standards, and very modern. The hotel has a nice lobby, and the location is perfect. The RER station to the airport (Luxembourg) is about four blocks away and the area is loaded with great places to eat. The Sorbonne, Luxembourg Gardens and Notre Dame are short walks. There is a great internet place down the street if you need to get some work done. I had to pay a steep price since this was the week of the Paris airshow, but it would be a good choice at other times.

<Content>Beautifully styled boutique hotel with great location. What a great place to stay while in Paris! After a thorough review of hotels we decided on this hotel. The position was perfect if you are arriving from Charles de Gaulle as it is 5 minutes from Luxemboug Gardens RER station and there are no transfers. If you are arriving at Orly there is only one exchange.We actually experienced three rooms. We had booked the lowest price and although the room was spotless and beautifully decorated, it was small and at the rear of the building so we asked if a superior front room was available. Although not large by North American standards, the superior rooms are definitely worth the extra dollars if you are spending a few nights or more. We stayed in two rooms for the remainder of our stay and both were very comfortable. In each case we had a balcony and the rooms overlooked the Pantheon. We had very little night noise and that suprised us as we were so close to various Sorbonne buildings.The hotel is part of the Rive Gauche group and the Hotel Pantheon adjoins this hotel. All seem to be of good standard but we did not see any of the individual rooms at other hotels in the group. The furnishings are of a superior standard. As an Interior decorator I enjoy staying in pleasant surroundings but at an affordable price. The Grand Hommes is a small Parisien styled hotel where attention has been paid to every detail. The walls are covered in fabric and there are antique pieces in the rooms. Bathrooms vary in size, but function very well.We would definitely stay at Hotel Grand Hommes again - I hope soon as we fell in love with Paris. It is a beautiful city.I would have displayed some great photos but unfortunately my camera was stolen in Monaco!!! The web site however is a good representation of the quality of the hotel.

<Content>Great setting, fully renovated, a bit on the expensive side I've booked my stay through the hotel's website, which worked very well.The hotel is located at the Place du Pantheon, a fantastic place to stay in. It's right in the middle of the Latin Quarter, next to the Sorbonne and the Luxembourg Gardens, and not far from the Notre-Dame. Regretfully the metro stations are not very close by, but in many cases one travels Paris by foot, so it's not such a problem as it might seem.The property is entirely renovated. The room (number 62) was a bit on the small side, but still adequate for one person. The service is prompt and responsive (although I must admit I was not a heavy duty user).One thing which was a bit bothersome is the price (160-200 Euros per night) but that's probably the regular run rate for hotels of that kind in Paris these days.And do not forget - Paris is the most beautiful city on Earth. And May is one of the best times of year to visit!

<Content>Lovely Hotel! I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights from 12 - 15 May and thought I would add to the other positive reviews of the property.The Hotel is, as other reviewers have stated, in a great location - right opposite the Pantheon and close enough to the RER, Metro etc, and has some nice eating places close by as well.We had booked 2 rooms, a double and a twin, and both were fresh in decor and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was great and looked recently refurbished.The hotel staff were very friendly and polite. Had breakfast in the hotel's breakfast room one of the days... was adequate but for 12 Euro (plus additional charge for use of the hot water / tea making facilities) we prefered eating at the local cafes.As previously stated the hotel is in a very quiet area. Our rooms faced into the courtyard area so we heard no street noise (if there was any during the night), but unfortunately on the Saturday night someone neighbouring the hotel had some kind of party and there was music and drunken whooping / screaming etc etc coming from their apartment into the courtyard area continually until about 4.30am. Not the hotel's fault though, and no doubt if we had called down to reception they would have tried to assist. Do they have noise curfews in Paris though??All in all a great place to stay and would not hesitate to recommend. Will be staying there again next time in Paris!

<Content>Modern conveniences with plenty of French charm! Do not hesitate to book this hotel! We just returned from a week-long stay in Paris (our first), and we loved the Hotel des Grand Hommes. I had a room on the fifth floor with french doors onto a balcony overlooking the Pantheon, and my sister and her husband had a huge room on the first floor. Both rooms were elaborately decorated in classic French style. This hotel has all of the modern conveniences, including high-speed internet access (free), air conditioning, mini bar, and television, but all the charm of a classic small French hotel. Rooms were beautiful and extremely clean. The location is great. It is right across from the Pantheon and central enough to walk all over the city. The staff was friendly and helpful with any requests we had, and all staff spoke English. There are some charming restaurants nearby, as well as great cafes and patisseries. We had breakfast at the hotel one day, and it was a good continental breakfast. My brother-in-law ordered an omelette which was also good. Be sure to request a room with a view, and if possible a balcony. It is well-worth it. I think this hotel has three stars under the French system, and we commented that we weren't sure what more could be required for a four-star, unless that requires a full restaurant. We agreed that if we return to Paris, we will return to this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>Classy little hotel! We stayed here for two nights after reading so many positive reviews about the hotel on T/A (our bible!!). We arrived early, before noon, our room was not ready till 2 p.m. but they stored our luggage while we went to an exhibition at the Musee de Luxembourg. We returned about 4, and were shown to our room. We had booked a Superior room with view and were disappointed to be given a room facing into a dark courtyard, not what we had requested. After speaking to the receptionist, she quickly found a solution. We were given room 1, on the ground floor, a very large beautiful room with sitting area, overlooking the Pantheon. We had this for one night, then had to move to another room on the first floor, also overlooking the Pantheon, which was smaller but just as perfectly formed! Both rooms were immaculately decorated, with good bathrooms and well above average compared to previous experience of Paris hotels, and although we had to move rooms it was a small inconvenience and took no time at all to do the transfer. Many thanks to the hotel staff for their professional attitude to all of the above.We had breakfast at the hotel which was in a charming room below stairs - a very adequate continental breakfast that kept us going throughout most of the day.Whilst reporting on Paris, may I point out our experience of two restaurants five minutes walk from the hotel (both in the Rue de Lanneau) - Le Petit Prince and Coup Chou. They are both charming, with excellent service and although the Coup Chou restaurant is wonderfully interesting with lots of quirky rooms, I would say that by comparison the food at Le Petit Prince was marginally better. That is not to say we did not enjoy our wonderful Bouef Bourginon at the Coup, it was plentiful and excellent.This visit to Paris was perfect in every respect. The Lalique Exhibition at the Musee de Luxembourg was breathtaking - weather was lovely, and an 8 mile walk around the sights on Sunday left us aching but not too guilty about all that gorgeous food!! Enjoy!!

<Content>Charming Parisian Hotel We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. This was my first trip to Paris and wanted a place that was close to everything, but would also provide a good neighborhood vibe without feeling to touristy. The hotel is located directly across from the Pantheon, a gorgeous neoclassical building. Its an approx. 7 minute walk to the metro and several great cafe's are located a block away. This metro stop (Luxembourg) was very convienent for getting around Paris and seeing all the attractions, and also provided direct transport to the train station and airport. The rooms were small (we're from NYC so this didn't bother us), very clean, well kept and we loved the parisian decore. The hotel was unique with lots of charm! Amenities we used included hotel safe, minifridge, hairdryer, soaps, breakfast cafe, concierge. The staff was very helpful- provided wine glasses for us to drink in our rooms and called a restaurant for us to make reservations (since we don't speak French). I will definitely come back and will stay here again. Best of all, the rates can't be beat for the atmosphere, quality, cleanliness, and location.

The Superior room had a great view overlooking the Pantheon and was reasonably quiet given the traffic. The standard room faced an inner courtyard and was thankfully quiet, even with the window open at night. Just wish they had softer sheets on the bed... was a bit harsh. The family enjoyed the daily breakfast in the cellar, which was included in our rate.Would definitely stay again!

<Content>No Complaints! This was my second trip to Paris and my first time staying on the left bank. This is a great little hotel. The location is close the metro, there is a great bread shop just around the corner, and the location is easy to explain to taxi drivers. The rooms are small, but this is Paris, all rooms are small. The staff is friendly, the hotel is clean, and the amenities are quite nice. I would recommend a room on one of the higher floors or on the interior of the hotel if you have a hard time sleeping. The street can be a little loud at night. The only draw back is the night life. If you are looking for a lively area with lots of cafes and bars that are busy around dinner time, I would search elsewhere. It seems like the area draws up the welcome mat around 7:00. In short, this a convenient, pretty little hotel, but it is not overwhelmingly lively at night.

The hotel was perfectly located for viewing all the sights and is only a short walk to Notre Dame. We had an excellent piew of the Pathenon but because of this we found it very noisy at night. The room was a perfect size (above average for the rest of Paris!)and very clean. The decor was fabulous.Didn't really have much interaction with the staff although the receptionist on the final day was very helpful and allowed us to store our bags while we spent the day site seeing.

<Content>Lovely, Relaxing My mother and I visited Paris for 3 days in early April and chose to stay at Grands Hommes because of the rave reviews on TripAdvisor. It is a small hotel with attentive, but not obvious staff. The location is fantastic for many reasons. It is quiet, but not deserted. There are numerous cafes and restaurants in the vicinity (We ate at the Tibetan on the street behind the hotel twice and recommend it). The Pantheon, as a landmark, can be used to direct taxis to the hotel if you are less than fluent in French. Our room was immaculate! There wasn't a spot that wouldn't pass the white glove test. I took a bath the first night without hesitation and it was fantastic and deep with plenty of hot water. The only reason we deny a five star rating is the price. There was nothing to complain about and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful, tasteful corner of Paris, but it doesn't come cheap. We paid roughly 185 euros a night.

<Content>Good location I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in April. I chose it based on previous reviews (some less than promising!). However, I found the hotel adequate. The location was good - fairly central to the main sights. I booked a superior room - although I'm not sure what was superior about it! It was small  bijou, although very clean. I think I was paying for the view of the Pantheon - not worth it - and there is some construction work going on in the building next door, so don't plan on having a lie in!! However, I would be very happy to stay here again due to location  cleanliness alone. I would , however, book the basic room and get my views elsewhere!

<Content>Excellent location My wife and I spent 3 nights here in early April 2007. The hotel has an excellent location, near many sites worth visiting. We know Paris well (having lived there for 4 years), and enjoyed being able to walk to the Latin quarter, the Luxembourg gardens and the Jardin des Plantes. There are many good cafes and brasseries nearby, too.All staff encountered were friendly and efficient - a special thank you to the lovely 'breakfast lady', who coped single handed with feeding the visitors!Any grumbles? Very few - the shower was a bit weak, the bed slightly firm for our taste, and there was some humming noise from a motor audible on the top floor (this seemed to run 24/7); this disturbed my first night, but I got used to it and slept well thereafter.Advice? Book on a website - the room rate is much lower than the 'official' rate which is shown on the bedroom wall (by law, in France).

<Content>Location, Style and Amenity all rolled into one On this occasion I took my wife and three young children to Paris and stopped at the Grands Hommes, I had stayed previously whilst on business.Before we arrived my youngest daughter asked what the hotel was like, I found it difficult to put into words, but it is perhaps easiest to say what it is not like.It is not a large multinational chain hotel and does not have a swimming pool, gynasium or a large entrance foyer.It does have plenty of character, comfortable rooms, friendly staff and is very clean, it has a terrific position about 10 minutes walk from the latin quarter and Notre Dame if you are able bodied or nearby access to the Metro and buses. Rooms at the front of the hotel also have a view of the Pantheon.Finally, for the view alone down the Rue Soufflot and towards the Jardins du Luxembourg and the Eiffel Tower, this hotel is well worth a visit.

<Content>Wonderful Paris Ist was our second stay in Hotel des grands Hommes and like the first time ist was again a really wonderful stay. This time we selected a standard room, which is small, but it' s enough space. Ther furniture is really nice, the room very clean und the bathroom with everything, we needed. And the most important - it is really quite. The reception is friendly and helpful. Thr location of the hotel is perfect. In front of the panth茅on an very easy an quick to go to by train from Orly an Charles de Gaulle. Only some steps to the Jardin du Luxembourg and to many buses. Around the hotel are many nice restaurants and caf茅s. We are sure that wie will next time in paris stay again in Hotel des Grands Hommes. For us it' s perfect.

<Content>Loved our stay in Paris Our first visit to Paris was made all the more memorable for having stayed at this hotel.We loved everything about it, its location was great with many restaurants within close walking distance and a short walk to the train station made it very easy to get around and see the city.A great little hotel for tourists.Our room was on the 4th floor with a lovely view of the Pantheon, the rooms are a little on the small side but the bed was very comfortable and had a nice large bathroom which was clean, as was the room.We had breakfast each morning at the hotel, which we throughly enjoyed.If and when we return to Paris, we would not hesitate to book this hotel again.

<Content>Return Visit This was a return visit as we enjoyed our first stay so much. The rooms are comfortable although compact and the location is excellent. It's worth requesting a front room as it's glorious to wake up to the Pantheon right outside the window. People watching is great value with the Sorbonne being so close.The staff are unfailingly helpful and courteous and although we didn't have breakfast there once on our first visit, we took it there almost every morning of our second visit. It was a lot cheaper and more substantial than in a cafe and the waitress was wonderful. There are plenty of good local restaurants within easy strolling distance and the Musee de Moyen Age is close by and well worth a visit to see the beautiful Lady and the Unicorn Tapestries. We will be happy to go back again on our next visit to Paris.

<Content>Loved Hotel Grands Hommes We were pleasantly surprised with this charming hotel right by the Pantheon. Great for walking around the Latin Quarter and St. Germain des Pres. Easy walk to the Louvre and Musee d'Orsay, and Notre Dame. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom was beautiful and spotless. Also very big! Would highly recommend this hotel for a short stay in Paris. The room is maybe a bit small for a longer stay (like a week or more).

<Content>Perfect Hotel My stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes was one of the highlights of my trip to Paris. The hotel is directly across the street from the Pantheon, in the Latin Quarter, and is easily accessible from several metro stops. There are also several excellent restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. As soon as I checked in the staff made me feel welcome and they were quite accomodating. I was traveling with a friend and had requested a room with two twin beds. When we arrived the room had just one double bed; the staff graciously changed our room and we ended up with a room on the top floor with a balcony and an incredible view. We could see all the way to Sacre Couer (on a day without pollution). The rates were extremely reasonable and included a complimentary breakfast, which saved us time and money in the morning. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Paris and would stay there myself again. The highest recommendation goes to the staff - they were friendly, very helpful and left me with a wonderful impression of the French people.

<Content>Great place to stay Our first stay in Paris and we feel we did very well to choose the HGH. We initially booked an 'inside' room because I'm fussy about noise. It looked a little dull and we upgraded to a room overlooking Pantheon Square. It was great to have such a lovely outlook and the noise level was perfectly tolerable.The Hotel is well placed for trips all over town - but we must have walked at least 10K on one day alone!The room was a little on the small side but everything was in immaculate condition. The staff were perfectly friendly and hepful. There's little more you can say about a hotel as a base for a sight-seeing trip. I'd certainly recommend it.Richard Abrahams

<Content>Relaxed stay at the Grands Hommes This is a very pleasant wee hotel at the side of the Pantheon. Nice, very clean room. Very helpful staff. There's a breakfast room in the basement which we didn't use- used a cafe down the street instead. They advertise a bar, but it's really just a couple of tables in the lobby, and they bring the drinks from next door.I'd easily go back. Quiet and relaxing.

<Content>Perfect Small French Hotel I stayed two nights at the Hotel des Grands Hommes in March. I had booked an internet rate (declined the breakfast) and thought the value was excellent. My room was in the rear, overlooking a courtyard, which was not a problem. The room was charmingly decorated, sparkling clean and the bathroom spotless. It was typically small, but as I was alone, space was not an issue. I cannot say enough about the courtesy of the entire front desk staff. Always a warm greeting, courteous and helpful.

Our room was lovely and overlooked the Pantheon. Both the university district and the St Germain area are within 10 minutes' walk. The breakfast was adequate. Overall, though, a great hotel. Would definitely return.

The room is small in typical Paris style, but perfectly fitted out, neat and clean. The staff at the hotel were also helpful and very obliging. We would definitely stay there again, although next time, if we booked more in advance try and get a room looking at the Pantheon (we sneaked a view of one of the rooms with a view, really lovely!).

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, Great Location and Nice Staff We stayed here for a 4 night break in late Feb. Hotel was great - we booked a standard room but requested a view if possible (most standard rooms are at the back and don't get the view of the Pantheon). Received an email saying a superior room was available for extra which we declined. When we arrived we were put in an amazing room - with wonderful parisian decoration, double french doors overlooking the Pantheon and square - fabulous. We were charged the amount we agreed (standard rate) and had an brilliant 5 days. Watched Wales loose in the rugby, did all the usual sight seeing - the metro is so good compared to the UK - short walk to the stops which take you anyway (buy a 10 book ticket). A gentle walk down to the Jardin du Luxembourg for a stroll, restuarants, shops in close proximity - just great. Suggest you buy a museum ticket as you can advance queues - saying that only Musee D'Orsay had a significant queue - the others were short. Staff couldn't have been more helpful.Would recommend it! Have fun.

<Content>Best hotel I've stayed in in Paris Oh tripadvisor, you've done it again! After a number of catastrophic, dirty, stinky Paris hotels, I spent an hour researching Tripadvisors top tips, and then booked my holiday on Expedia.The hotel was dead cute. Very small room, and even smaller bathroom, but all perfectly formed, with really OTT '19th century' style decor - that was so extreme it was endearing. The area is fantastic, accross from the Pantheon and around the corner from the market of Rue de Mouffetard. The price was really reasonable, but there was some confusion with paying - I thought I had paid in advance on expedia, but the payment didn't seem to go through. Probably best to book direct with the hotel rather than expedia, as they say they'll beat any internet price anyway...

As it is close to the Luxembourgh RER-station it is very convenient and easy to reach from CDG Airport. The surrounding area is safe, peaceful and charming with nice restaurants and streets. The service in the hotel was friendly and the athmosphere warm and welcoming. The standard double room was quite small but so French and the bathroom was big and charming.

<Content>great little hotel my husband and i and 2 friends are just back from our stay at this hotel and it was great.firstly,what a great location, right at the pantheon,our friends had a room at the front of the hotel overlookingthe pantheon, almost within touching distance! my husband and i had a room on the top floor (theres a small lift) and at the back of the hotel but don`t think that this was an inferior room, it wasn`t, it was so warm and inviting and cosy just what we needed because the weather was very cold. the decor of the whole hotel was beautiful, all fabric on the walls and decorative plasterwork everywhere just the style you`d expect from paris! the place was also very well maintained and spotlessly clean, our bedlinen and towels were snow white. another lovely place was the breakfast room in the basement, it seems to have been a wine cellar in days gone by. breakfast itselfwas great, lots of choice and plenty to keep you going most of the day. the staff in the hotel were great too, very kind and helpful and courteous enough not to laugh at our hillarious french! this was my first trip to paris and this hotel made it special and i can`t wait to stay here again!

<Content>Great Location I wanted to surprise my Fiance with a weekend break in Paris for Valentine's day. We stayed at the Hotel Des Grands Hommes after reading some of the reviews in expedia. The hotel is idealy locacted. We had a room that had a splendid view of the Pantheon. It was a small, clean room with a large bathroom. This is to be expected in Paris. We stayed in room 10 on the first floor. We were serenaded every morning from 07.00 hrs onwards by the street cleaners and binmen. Perhaps the noise could be reduced by placing shutters on the windows ?The breakfast was typically French. The croissants and pain au chocolat were in short supply and not the best quality.In Essence, this hotel is ideally located. The noise from the street can be heard in the hotel. The quality of the breakfast does not reflect the high quality of the French Boulangerie.

However, one day we came back to the hotel at 2.30 pm and the room was still being made. We had to wait downstairs for about 15 minutes. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel as we liked to eat outside.The room was a bit small and had not the view on the Pantheon as shown on the website. Our view was on a small inner court. We can fully recommend this hotel.

<Content>Amazing This was the most charming and outstanding hotel. We stayed there on the 5th floor in a room facing the coartyard. It was queit at night and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was extroadinarily clean. The staff were helpful - although I did not converse with them much.The location of this hotel is amazing. Tons of restaurants close by, the Jardin de Luxembourg and the subway were a 2 minute walk away. There is a really cute boulangerie behind the hotel. We walked 10 minutes to the Notre Dame Chapel and the Ile de Cite, Sien etc.And walking out to look at the pantheon was amazing. The decor was also cute - although some might find it a little flashy.We never ate at the hotel breakfast - I think that it was too expensive, and there were several cheap options nearby. Yes the lift was small - but who cares?The room actually had plenty of storage space, and they could keep extra luggage in the lobby for you. You will not make a mistake staying at this hotel.Also, Paris is still awseome in Winter

<Content>Nice hotel and Location! Quite a nice facility in a lovely area near Luxembourg Garden. I would consider the rooms very well appointed and somewhat small. The bathroom was the nicest and the largest that we have experienced in our 4 trips to France. Overall a very nice facility.Of course there some areas where the hotel could have done better: When we booked we specifically requested a courtyard room (non-street) only to get a street room upon arrival. Also, the overnight desk attendant's degree of utter uselessness was only matched by his extreme disdain for his customers. We also found out the hard way that kids like to use the Pantheon area at night for its echoing properties when they scream.Overall, this was a good value for us and would use the hotel again. With some increased willingness to help from the staff, this hotel could be great!

<Content>A Beautiful location - a good choice! We stayed at this lovely little hotel in early January; when Paris is quiet though still celebrating the Christmas season. The Grand Hommes is in a marvellous location overlooking the splendid Pantheon, in the charming Latin Quarter of the city - about 15 mins walk from the more touristy areas of Notre Dame. We stayed in a very nicely furnished front room (32), with magnificent decoration. The view from the room was stunning.Only point of criticism (and supports other reviewers) was the quality of the sheets - they are not of the best cotton...i.e. beware of sheet burns!!Apart from that, I would most certainly recommend this well organised and welcoming hotel.

<Content>Wonderful experience We had a wonderful week at the Hotel des grands Hommes in Paris. My husband and I traveled with our daughter and son-in-law, and both rooms (superior doubles) were very pleasant. The hotel is perfectly situated, attractively decorated, clean, and well maintained. Even in January we enjoyed having balconies that overlooked hotel's courtyard. We had the best of both worlds -- the convenience of the Latin Quarter, yet the absolute absence of street noise. And the Pantheon is quite a beautiful landmark to guide you back after a day of sightseeing in Paris. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I enthusiastically recommend the hotel.

<Content>Breakfast with the Big Men This is not the first time I visited Hotel des Grandes Hommes, which is situated right next to the majestic Pantheon. And it will also not be the last - Hotel des Grandes Hommes is like a cosy home for me - in the heart of the romantic city of Paris. With the wide-open space of the Pantheon square, the Pantheon itself and the nearby Sorbonne, you cannot find a better place to breathe Paris. And a breakfast in your room overlooking the Pantheon - the Sun starting to paint its white facades pink - while Paris awakens, is unforgettable. And as for the hotel itself - beautiful. Small and beautiful. The staff is friendly and the day-time staff speaks English and are very helpful with advice and reservations. My room was decorated in egyptian style and with a balcony - perfect for red wine in the afternoon and champagne with the breakfast. :-) You know, it is Paris after all.

<Content>A grand stay at the Grands Hommes We had an excellent short break pre-Christmas here, soaking up the Parisian atmosphere in the smaller shops and cafes.The hotel is near to an RER station for direct rail from Paris CDG airport and if you enjoy walking as we do it is easy to reach the main sites on foot, or there are Metro stops. It is beside the Pantheon and our superior grade room had a wonderful view of it. The room was classically furnished and comfortable and breakfasts were good, with all staff most friendly and welcoming. It is situated on a very quiet square but handy for the Musee de Moyen Age, the Sorbonne, the wonderful bookshops of Place St Michel, the Luxembourg Gardens and Notre Dame.We would highly recommend this hotel for a reasonably-priced stay on the Rive Gauche -a great base for exploring Paris.

<Content>Lovely location, generally very good stay. We stayed for three nights beginning of January 07. We got an excellent rate through a travel booking engine.Overall, the experience was very good. We felt that the hotel staff were just helpful enough without going far out of their way to assist us. The location is excellent, our room was gorgeous, great bathroom, we had a room with a balcony which made the trip for us much more memorable. Despite the winter temps, we did eat our breakfast on the patio every morning. The hotel itself was quite warm temperature wise but I think it was unseasonably warm outside. Nothing that the window being open for a while didn't fix. It was clean and comfortable and we would definitely stay there again. Only major gripe was no staff assistance for the bags which you would receive in a larger hotel but we had too many of them and would have loved a strong doorman to assist us. Stay here, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Everything but the beds A beautiful hotel with excellent serivce and unbeatable location. The area managed to be quiet and relaxing while still being very near great sites and transportation options. Many charming little neighborhoods to explore in the area, but easy to get to where the action is. The staff was very friendly and helpful (my dress strap broke as we were getting into the cab for New Year's Eve, and the desk attendant sewed it up and sent me off with a little sewing pack). We were promised a room with a Pantheon view but got one with a terrace in the back -- although I decided not to complain as we thought that might be more quiet and private. Had the weather been nice, we would have prefered the little terrace anyways. My other main complaint is the beds -- they were hard as a ROCK. And the pillows were the opposite, way too soft and fluffy. As much as I loved the hotel, my husband and I were in great pain and discomfort after 5 nights on those awful beds -- and as much as we really enjoyed the hotel, if the beds are all like that, we couldn't come back. I would have given 5 stars otherwise...

We just returned from a quite short 4 day trip to Paris  stayed at this hotel which we have stayed at before - we loved the room w  the location of the hotel is great as well however what made us most happy was the management and desk service - they were very attentive  helpful even checking on our last day that we were up  about after our wake-up call so as we would not miss our early flight - this is a very nice place to stay in such a wonderful city - gerard NYC

<Content>Great Hotel, perfect location This is definitely my favourite hotel of this category in Paris - I would recommend it to anyone and will be staying here again. The location is excellent, either as a central base for sightseeing on foot or with metro  RER stations within 5 mintues walk. The RER station nearby has frequent  direct links to the airport. (We also felt completely safe walking around this area at night). The hotel itself has a very boutique feel e.g. with fabric wallcoverings and carved winding staircase. The staff were very helpful, polite  welcoming (this makes a huge difference to any hotel stay in my opinion) My boyfriend  I appreciated the kitch luxe of our room and the unique details such as cherubs over the bedhead  chaise longue covered in cushions made the experience seem even more parisienne. We booked a superior room with a great view across to the Pantheon, cannot comment on the breakfast as we took a stroll to the seine/Notre Dame for a coffee instead. Tip : visit the hotel website for special offers/discounted rates.Sophia  Rich, UK

<Content>Promide a lot but didn't deliver This hotel promised a lot, but didn't really deliver. The expected views of the Pantheon and romantic balconies did not eventuate. The reception from staff was very professinal and pleasant but getting to our room from the lift was not so easy. A huge trolley with linen was parked outside the lift door and we were unable to get our suitcase past. This necessitated lifting the heavy suitrcase over the trolley as we could not move it. The room itself was delightfully furnished and the very comfortable bed had lovely linen. However as usual in Paris, space was at a premium. There was nowhere in the room to open 2 suitcases so we had to put one in the bathroom. And the view over the shabby internal courtyard was particularly uninspiring. So our final night in Paris had none of the romance I expected, and certainly no views of the Pantheon. The breakfast room (a vaulted cellar) was charming but cramped and claustrophobic. We were lucky in finding a table but others were not. The hot water urn was boiling and releasing its steam into this very small space. We should have gone out for breakfast. Usually we stay in 2 star hotels in Paris. This was our first foray into a 3 star, as a treat for our final night. Unfortunately not value for money. The other hotel we stayed in, the Hotel de Nice on the Rue de Rivoli was adequate in terms of facilties, cheaper and full of eclectic French charm. And the money saved could be used on a nice meal in the Marais.

<Content>Amazing location, beautiful rooms and friendly - a real star find Both my friend and I have been to Paris many times and found Hotel des Grands Hommes to be an absolutely amazing star find and without doubt the best hotel for its money in the whole of Paris. The rooms were beautifully decorated and impecably clean. The staff were so friendly and helpful and you could not wish for a better location, it is honestly just a dozen steps away from the Pantheon, no lie!

<Content>loved the Grands Hommes stayed for four days in a top floor suite...with a terrific view of Paris from the terrace facing the Pantheon. The room was an excellent choice. Consulted frequently with the front desk staff and was always given prompt, courteous and very helpful assistance. Hotel was conveniently located for either the Metro or for walking to destinations on either side of the Seine. We never used a taxi during our stay. We heartily recommend the hotel. The price was reasonable at around $200 a night. Our traveling companions stayed in a smaller room for around $160/night. Their room was quite reasonable. These two rooms were the only ones available when we made our reservation..

<Content>A Very Pleasant Stay We spent three nights at this charming hotel directly overlooking the Pantheon. My wife and I have been to Paris many times, and this was our favorite hotel. I would certainly choose to return to the same hotel, and the same room (#22), if possible. The room was more spacious than most Paris hotel rooms, but still small by American standards. But at least there was space to turn around. It was perfectly clean, and nicely decorated. I should mention that some other rooms I saw were rather smaller, although also nicely decorated. The location, on the Place du Pantheon, was perfect. And the price, off season at the end of November, was extremely reasonable -- about 109 Euros per night. I am sure it is much more expensive at other times of the year.The staff were helpful and pleasant.

<Content>Grands Hommes Encore When visiting Paris, Grands Hommes is the hotel I select first, and I'm disappointed when its fully booked. The location opposite the Pantheon is one of the best in Paris, and it's easy to walk to other famous places. The decor is stylish and the hotel is quiet. Ideal.

<Content>Great Hotel We recently spent 4 nights in this hotel and I would highly recommend it. It is in a great location, near some nice bistros and just 10 minutes walk to notre dame (and all downhill!!!). Although just one metro stop from the lively centre of Paris the surrounding area is very peaceful and relaxing. The rooms were clean and the decor was fantastic.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel in Great Location with Lovely Staff Just back from 3 nights in Paris and the Hotel des Grands Hommes. The trip was a surprise for my wifes birthday so I wanted everything to be perfect....and it was (relief !) The hotel is in a great location in the 5th Arr and a gentle stroll from the train station RER Line B - direct to CDG airport. It has plenty of restaurants and shops nearby and an easy downhill stroll to Notre Dame. Our room was compact but spotlessly clean and very well presented. The decor was very warm and romantic - which followed throughout the hotel - a very cozy and homely feel to the place. We had breakfast included which offered good choice and there was plenty of it to keep you going for the day. All in all a place I would defintely reccommend without hesitation.

My room had views to the Pantheon and was really nice. Comfortable, clean, good bed, good heating, kind people...no complaints at all. We didn't took the breakfast at the hotel, I like trying different places everyday and it is plenty of them on the surroundings. Five minutes walking to the Metro. If you try don't miss the italian restaurant is just on the street behind the hotel !! Bon appetit...

<Content>Very nice small hotel with convenient location My wife and I stayed here for four nights. While the sleeping room was quite small (not unusual for European cities), the bathroom appeared to be recently renovated and was very bright and roomy. We enjoy the smaller hotels and were not disappointed here. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location (across from the Pantheon) was convenient to many sites, restaurants and public transportation. The nearness of the RER train station (Luxembourg) was especially appreciated as it provided direct connections to the Gare du Nord (where we arrived) and to Charles de Gaulle Airport (where we departed).

<Content>A lovely boutique hotel My husband and I stayed at Hotel des Grande Hommes 18 years ago and we loved it then. We originally found the hotel in Karen Brown's book on France. This summer we traveled back to Paris with our two teenage sons and we stayed once again at the hotel. It was so lovely! This is a high-end 3 star. Very old world and elegant but not over the top fancy. It is very small, the elevator only holds two and there is only ever one person at the front desk.The hotel is located next to the Pantheon and is close to the metro as well as wonderful cafes and restaurants. At first we thought the charge for breakfast was too expensive at 12 euros but after tiny cups of coffee for 5 Euros at the cafes, we gladly paid to have unlimited delicious coffee. Overall The Hotel des Grande Hommes is a great place to stay in Paris. It is an excellent value, extremely clean and the staff is very warm and helpful. I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great location, nice room! Overall we were very pleased with our stay at Hotel des Grands Hommes in August 2006. Good points include the location (3 short blocks from the Luxembourg RER station, whisking you to CDG airport in 35 minutes), the style and cleanliness of the room, the great view, nice breakfast, air conditioning, and wireless Internet access in the lobby (free Internet access is rare in France).The biggest negative was the shower, which sprayed water all over the bathroom, leaving puddles everywhere. Fortunately the cleaning staff did a good job mopping up each day. Other minor negatives are the small room size (we had to keep moving our luggage around to be able to maneuver around the bed), street noise (although the windows block out most noise, drunk kids hanging out and shouting in front of the Pantheon woke me up late Saturday night), and the dungeon-like ambiance of the basement breakfast room.

<Content>Best Deal in Town We had reserved through the Internet nine months in advance and so had a very low price for this exceptional hotel. This was our third stay. The rooms are a bit small but well maintained and bright (looking out on the Pantheon). The location is excellent with a moderate walk to a not very busy Metro station. Staff at the desk are a bit reserved, but helpful in arranging transportation and giving directions. There are some exceptional restaurants within walking distance. Can't think of a better place to be while visiting Paris.

<Content>Position, position, position This charming, rather expensive hotel is situated in a fabulous position on the West Bank, right near the Boulevardes St Germain and Michele. Rooms are small and inadequately accommodate an international traveller with a normal size suitcase and handluggage.Friendly staff who unfortunately had selective understanding when it was pointed out that the furnishings in the room were greatly in need of a good clean. The bedspreads in particular were filthy in the dimly lit room. Can't imagine how they would have appeared under a stronger light. However, this problem was attended to by the staff, not in taking them away to be cleaned, but in having them folded and relegated to the cupboard, obviously in wait for the next guest.Apart from the lack of space and cleanliness, our room had a beautiful view over the Pantheon from a delightful terrace and the position won the day.

<Content>Lovely stay at Grands Hommes I chose this hotel because of its immaculate attention to Empire/Biedermeir decor and was amply justified to pay a bit extra for a room that almost transported me into an Ingres painting: the walls covered with period fabrics, the antique writing table and the mirror, the bas-relief over the bed, the crown moldings, a charming lobby and a winding staircase all added authenticity and credibility to a spectacular view of the Pantheon from our window. The bed (taking up 3/4 of the room) was very comfortable, and the linens very soft and clean, although the little bed covers looked a bit worn. Despite the warnings about the size of the rooms, I did not actually expect our room to be so tiny (hence above average and not excellent rating), but it was ok for our purposes. The bathroom was very good, with a very clean, large, deep bath tub. At the checkout, I had the maid show me all the rooms on the 5th floor, and I actually preferred those without the view (they had a nicer lay out and larger baths with windows). All rooms had different wall coverings and furniture pieces, but the spirit of the epoque was well preserved. The location was great for us because we wanted to explore the Latin Quarter and St. Germain. The RER station is 5 min walk. The famous right bank areas (Champs Elysees, St. Honore and Monmartre) are easily accessible by subway. The staff was very nice and welcoming (especially the breakfast room lady, the morning reception lady and the maids). The evening staff could not recommend a restaurant serving food after 11pm or any dance clubs off the top of their heads (I guess their job does not allow them to get out much at nights), but they were willing to do some i-net research for us. We ended up having dinner at Le Port du Salut right around the corner at 163 Rue Saint Jacques, and it was one of our best meals in France (the maitre d' went out of his way to make this first meal in Paris special and memorable for us). Overall, I am glad we stayed at the Grands Hommes because it conveyed the time period so well and would consider staying there again if the price were right.

<Content>Fantastic hotel with friendly staff We stayed (4 adults and 3 teens) in Hotel des Grands Hommes for 6 nights (April 16-22). We had 3 rooms (32, 33 and 53). The rooms are decorated beautifully although small. However, the rooms are quiet and comfortable. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. In short, it is a fantastic hotel in a fantastic area. I agree with the previous reviewers with regard to the location and the nightlife. We will stay there again.

<Content>Perfect paris in the Springtime - perfect hotel My Sister and I stayed here for a shopping trip. If you are looking for a small hotel with plenty of french charm then the hotel Grands Hommes cannot be beaten. The Views from our room ( Fifth Floor) were outstanding and the location was perfect for all the nightflife and shopping of the leftbank. The rooms are really cute  quirky with lots of lovely period touches and detail and although small they are perfectly comfortable. A few reviews had mentioned that the staff were not friendly but we did not find this with any of the staff we came across.A real gem in the heart of the city - loved it!!

<Content>Almost Great! Stayed here for a romantic long weekend for wife's b-day. Room was tiny but cozy -- once i got used to how small it was i really liked it....the decor was great - authentic empire but not in the cheezy obligatory way....also nice modern bright bath. literally NO room for luggage and the tiniest of closets (once we unpacked we gave the bags to staff to hold). Location is good, not great, but now that we've gotten to know Paris I'd probably look at hotels in areas we really liked. Our room had a great view of the Pantheon which definitely gave the room even more personality, but i wouldnt say the Pantheon is a must see if youre on a long weekend trip. Its basically the college town part of Paris so its pretty young and not as chi chi. Having said that, the hotel is a tremendous bargain and if i had to pay alot more to stay elsewhere i probably wouldnt becuase the Metro's 5 minutes from the hotel and its so easy to get around. The staff is sweet and willing to help, but young and not too knowledgeable about restaurants (i never did find that unforgettable boulangerie).

<Content>Extremely small rooms at Hotel des Grands Hommes The location is the best thing about this place.The front desk people are friendly.But: The rooms are ridiculously small.Everyone knows that hotel rooms in Paris are usually small, but this is too bad. The rates are definitely too high for ca.12m2 rooms. It's so and so enough for one person with very little luggage. My room was supposed to be a superior room and assumably more spacious than the standard ones.Also: the rooms are full of colourful fabrics, so they look somehow theatrical, but too much is too much.Elsewhere you'd pay max 100 Eur for this.

This hotel is gorgeous, the location is fantastic, aprrox 10 mins walk from Notre Dame, close to shops, metro etc.We had a wonderful view from our room (number 60) and our own balcony which was fantastic. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only downside is the breakfast which is 12 euros for some croissants and coffee which we thought was a bit expensive.I would definitely recommend this hotel as a romantic, cosy and inviting place to stay in Paris.Jessica - London

<Content>A 3 star gem One of two hotels we stayed at in Paris. Both good to excellent but Hommes won for great lobby, best hotel room we have ever had for a 3 star hotel in Paris and great service. By the way.... wi-fi worked excellent. We had read earlier reviews on tripadvisor and asked for a top floor room. We stayed in room 60 on the 6th floor. It had a beautiful bed, a separate couch/reading room w/ a small table and desk, and a great bathroom. Extremely clean and the winner of all..... a balcony that had a killer view and as large a balcony of any hotel we have had in Paris. Two separate table and a view over the Pantheon that was incredible. we could see Sacre Coeur and the top of the Eiffel Tower at night lit up. Just a great experience.Plus we were close to Jardin Luxembourg that was 3 blocks away and the Perraudin restaurant (small, classic french, checked tablecloths, daily menu written on the mirrors and a 3 course dejeuner at only 18 euros... ended eating there twice). Would highly recommend if you can get a 5th or 6th floor room.

<Content>A little gem I found this hotel through TripAdvisor reviews, and was not disappointed. The front desk staff are young and attractive, and very helpful. The lobby itself is lovely. I booked an inexpensive room on the second floor (no view), and yes, it was small, but certainly not the broom closet I expected. The storage was sufficient for a single person for a weeklong trip. The bed was comfortable and the room was VERY quiet. The bathroom was spotless and roomy. My only quibble is with the (typically Parisian) partial glass shower screen. Somehow I always get the bathroom floor wet with those things. Oh, well.As other reviewers have stated, don't eat breakfast downstairs. It is 12 euros and looked like it was nothing special. Rather, go down the adjacent Rue Soufflot and have a 7 or 8 euro breakfast including terrific croissant or pain au chocolat and cafe creme while enjoying some great people watching. The location is so convenient. I walked to dinner off the Blvd. Saint Germain every night in less than 10 minutes. Great little hotel, nice value, definitely would stay here again. Go and enjoy!

<Content>Wonderful service! We stayed Aug 17-21 and loved the location. Right across the street from the Pantheon. With cafes and shops galore nearby, and the metro just a short walk away it's convenient to say the least. Good walking locale if you like to hoof it. Notre Dame and Louvre are an easy distance on foot. We did not opt for the breakfast plan, no need with so many good cafes nearby. You will be unpleasantly surprised by the size of the rooms, we're talking miniscule here, with no storage to speak of. Thankfully the bathrooms do not follow suit. If you are like us and do not intend to spend much time in your room you will be pleased with this hotel. We think the location and the warm personal attention from each and every member of the staff we encountered more than made up for the size of the room, we will stay there again.

<Content>Exquisite! Pleasantly surprised by a beautiful, comfortable, superior double room with large French windows opening upon the Pantheon. Located in the Latin Quarter near to Notre Dame and St. Germain with loads of local color from student-filled cafes, cheese and wine shops, and narrow streets to explore. The only tour busses were those nearing the Pantheon during the day, but the crowds were never excessive. Hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant. Room accommodations were tasteful and stylish. This is one of the Preference Hotels, a luxury line of hotels. Best thing is we obtained this room at more than 50% off! A fine bargain! Would definitely stay again, as I feel I found a rather private place in an awfully busy city.

The location is perfect, we walked to all the sights, but the best bit was being so close to all the resturants and bars of the latin quater. I think other reviews have said about the rooms being small, but we liked it as it was so perfectly presented, we even had bathrobes, which you never get in the UK. Noise has also been mentioned...yes you are on the main square, but with the windows closed we could hear very little, and besides the view made up for it! I would stay again, but would recomend anyone to hold out for a good deal on their own website

<Content>Enjoyed the Hotel des Grands Hommes We stayed at the Hotel des Grands Hommes in April on a business trip and weekend getaway. It was our first trip to Paris and we wanted to stay in the Left Bank. There are lots of options for staying in this area, and while the Hotel des Grands Hommes is not the most centrally located hotel, it is within walking distance to major sights and classic Parsien streets. There is also easy access to the underground for transportation to/from the airport and trains to London. The staff spoke English when asked and were very polite. It's a historic hotel across from the Pantheon. Our room was traditonally decorated and quite large for our expectations. Our room on the second floor had a small balcony with chairs that faced into a small courtyard. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and the time we spent roaming the surrounding streets, cafes, and park. It was a great value for the price and we would recommend the hotel to friends.

<Content>You are paying for location It depends on what you were looking for. If you are looking for a cute hotel in a great neighborhood and you don't care about the price than this is a good bet. Really, you are paying for the location as this hotel is DIRECTLY across from the Pantheon, just up the road from Luxembourg gardens (with a direct RER line to the airports), and easy walk from St. Germain. This hotel's charming reviews seem to come from people who have stayed in the Superior rooms with a view. If you are planning to stay in one of those rooms, you will not find much better (some rooms even have a private balcony). For all others: you can expect a VERY small room (even by Paris standards), although a very large bathroom (takes up half of the room), and a steep price. For the money you could do better I think.

<Content>Some like it hot! Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel - a special trip with my mother and daughter which was booked and confirmed over 2 months in advance. On arrival I was told there was 'a problem' and we could not have a room with a view. Actually what she meant was they had given our superior room to someone else - presumably someone willing to pay a higher rate than the one we booked with them!No offer was given of compensation or even that they would give us a reduction from the superior rate to the standard rate until we asked!To top it all we had arrived to temperatures of over 100 degrees and the hotel refused to put on the air conditioning as it was not summer! They advertise air conditioning on their website but don't say it can't be switched on until June even if you are frying in your beds. Many guests were complaining but the staff/management just shrugged it off.Generally disappointing as this is really a lovely hotel but let down by a very poor attitude by the staff/management who have never heard of customer service.

I liked the pedestal sink.  Service was friendly. We got some good tips on visiting Versailles and got quite a few messages and calls passed through during my stay.

<Content>We will return! We loved our charming little room so much that we extended our stay for two more nights. The service throughout the hotel was fantastic and the room quiet. The location was perfect- near Luxembourg Gardens and the restaurants/bars of the Latin Quartier. The only problem we had was getting our cabbie to understand Hotel des Grands Hommes in our terrible French accents.

<Content>Location Location Location Right on Place du Pantheon this Hotel has a great location in the Latin Quarter. Its quiet but still close to lots of Restaurants and bars, and easy to walk into the centre (also easy to find your way back to cos of that great big Pantheon is on every map and road sign). Its close to the metro and also the RER trains that run right through to Gare du Nord for Eurostar and to CDG airport (I think Orly too but dont take my word for it) There is a not-too-cliche english pub, the bombadier, just across the square, and a great little bakery round the back for a morning croissant on the go.We found the staff very friendly, they let us into our room at 11am despite check in not being until the afternoon, and they spoke perfect english without the snootyness you get from some parisians if your french is naff. The room was the usual compact, city hotel room but had a nice little balcony. Decoration was new and luxurious, though not everyone has a taste for monkey nest wallpaper, and the room was clean and comfortable. Highly Recommended.

<Content>Very Disappointing Service My husband and I travel frequently to Paris for work and I look forward to the opportunity to stay for the weekend. We typically stay in the Marais or Montparnasse. In early November, we had the opportunity to meet up with family for the weekend in Paris and my parents recommended that we all book rooms at the Hotel de Grands Hommes since it was located near my step-brother's apartment in the Latin Quarter. We booked our room 8 weeks in advance. We booked a second room for my sister two weeks before our stay and received confirmation for both rooms. So, we were quite shocked to arrive at the hotel Friday around 8pm to find out that there was a computer problem and no rooms available for us. We were sent to another hotel a few blocks away where the rooms were adequate--but not very nice or well located. We also had an issue when the new hotel tried to charge us a higher rate. We expressed our disappointment and were told that something would be done to compensate us for the inconvenience. The next morning--we returned to the hotel (where the rest of our family did have rooms...) and were given our rooms. When we asked if we would receive a reduced rate for the inconvenience, we were told that the manager would take care of us later that day. When we returned to the hotel that afternoon after a day of sightseeing..the manager was not there. We asked again when we checked out if the manager was available and were told no, but we could have a free breakfast. We explained that we already went to breakfast and were offered a credit to our room for the price of the breakfast (10 euro/person). It was suggested that if I was not satisfied with this resolution that I could send an email. I sent the email...and was told that the best offer was the credit for the breakfast. I was also told that they would offer me a reduced rate for a future hotel stay. I was due back in Paris the first weekend of December and they had rooms available on their web site. When I gave them the dates and asked for the rate for two rooms--I was told that they were fully booked. Needless to say--I have not pursued further and will never stay at this hotel again. The rooms were nice and the rates are reasonable...however, there are dozens of equally nice hotels in Paris that provide much better service.

<Content>Are We in Paris or Rome? A comfortable hotel next to the Pantheon. The decor is a bit over the top, with greco-roman imagery everywhere, and the location is a bit removed from the center of the left bank. Still, it's a great value for Paris.

<Content>One of the best in Paris Up to September 2004 I had lived in Paris for 3 years and spent nearly as long searching for the perfect hotel to put friends and family in when they visited. Never had much luck finding the perfect match of location, comfort, standards and price until I was due to get married in Paris this summer. I spent a weekend searching nearly every hotel in the 5th and 6th arrondissements, from 3* to 5*. I settled on the Hotel des Grands Hommes because for the price, the location and standards were far superior to any others nearby. I needed rooms for 14 guests over 5 nights and they were very quick to do a deal. The rooms are nicely decorated and if you go for the superior rooms (on the Pantheon side) you get a little bit more space (which is rare in Paris). Decor is very French - fabric print wallpaper that everyone found 'charming'. Rooms were clean, quiet, with nice bathrooms and well made up. The staff at the hotel were very good, from the moment I asked for a pre-booking inspection of various rooms until the moment the guests all checked out. All 14 guests had good comments. They arranged the usual services like taxis, dinner recommendations as well as non-standard wedding things like getting a hairdresser brought in, extra umbrellas (rain on your wedding day....) etc. Location is excellent if you like the 5th and 6th (my favourite area of Paris - I lived there!). Quiet enough not to be in the tourist-trap St Michel area but close enough to everything (literally right beside the Pantheon). I still go back to Paris on business and, although the business rates are slightly higher mid-week, it is still worth it.This is a 3* hotel and so it has 3* prices but it is not a typical Paris 3*. OK it's obviously not 5* standard but certainly better than many 4*. If you want to stay in the 5th or 6th and don't want to end up paying 鈧?00+ then this is by far the best hotel I can recommend.

<Content>lovely and romantic Just returned from 4 nights in Paris at this hotel and loved it. The location could not be better, the room was small, but comfortable and the view of the pantheon from our balcony was marvellous. I disagree that the minibar was overpriced -- as minibar prices go, it was very reasonable (4 eur for a bottle of beer, which would sell for about 3.5 at a nearby cafe). Definitely worth going for the 'superior' double to get the view!

<Content>Gorgeous rooms and friendly staff We stayed 4 nights at this pretty hotel based on reviews published here. An excellent choce! The location was very convenient but, due to proximity to the Place du Pantheon, there was little traffic noise, especially at night. The superior room had a queen-sized bed with about 2 feet of space on either side. Opposite the foot of the bed was an antique table and chair with a small TV. From the wall coverings and hangings to the furnishings and lamps to the intricate dentil moulding, the room was elegantly decorated. This tasteful approach made the smallness of the room less obvious. The bathroom was largish and similarly tasteful, with coordinated white and lavender ceramic tiling, cross-handled chrome faucets, a tub big enough to swim in, and even a chrome-handled toilet brush. My wife might say the room was over-the-top, but it never felt uncomfortable or too formal to me and I quite enjoyed the luxuries. The majority of the staff were unusually friendly and accommodating, even charming. They were able to get taxis for us almost as soon as we made the requests. On our last night we requested a cab for 7:45 the next morning, and it was there exactly on time. When we first arrived we had a little trouble with the room key, and the desk clerk immediately RAN up 4 flights of stairs to help. If I had to say something negative, I'd comment that the rooms were sometimes made up at odd hours, the maid staff ignored our DND sign several times, the minibar was overpriced, one night clerk was less than consistently gracious, and breakfast buffet items were not always replenished.With a quiet but central location and offering great comfort for a reasonable price, we would definitely return to this charming hotel.

<Content>Gorgeous, we loved it! We were so surprised to see our room - the only one with a balcony looking into the face of the Pantheon! Service was excellent, staff very friendly and the location superb. We would definitely stay here again. It made our first time in a Paris a dream come true!
