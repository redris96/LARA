<Content>Love this hotel This is a great hotel, with the tram stopping right outside you are in a great location away from the hustle  bustle. There are plenty of nice restaurants within walking distance too, Pulpo being within a 5 min walks and serves great food (The steak is a fave). If you don't fancy breakfast at the hotel which I think is a little pricey if you don't want the full monty, you can turn right out of the hotel and within 5 mins walk you will find a small cafe  bakery. If you want to walk through the Vondel Park there is also a cafe next to the film museum that serves breakfast. The rooms at the hotel are very trendy, if you like privacy when using the bathroom then not ideal but I maintain that this is the best shower you will find in a hotel. The staff are very helpful and always happy. I have stayed at this hotel for business many many times and choose come back here for a romantic weekend with the hubby, it was just as good. Finally dutch food can be hard to find, I recommend Moeders which serves food like your Mum would do if she was Dutch! It's a quirky place with mismatched grocery and pictures of diners Mum's on the wall.

<Content>A very nice hotel in a quiet part of town This hotel is in the south part of Amsterdam and very close to the #2 tram which runs all the way to the very north of the city stopping at the Central Station. The hotel was next to the scenic Vondelpark (hence the name of the hotel). I really enjoyed wandering through looking at the trees, ponds, ducks, etc. on my way to explore the town. The hotel staff was extremely accomodating and everything was clean! We booked a double room and were initially given 2 beds. When we called the front desk to move us to a room with one bed, they did so without hesitation and upgraded us to an executive suite. That's always a plus! The only weird thing, which I had read on other review sites, is that the executive suite has a very non-private bathroom. True! There is no door that actually closes you off from hearing and partially seeing your suitemate use the facilities. Not my thing. Apart from that the beds were very comfortable which can be a hard thing to find in Europe, in my experience. The staff was always attentive and quick. I paid 100 Euro per night on average for the time we were there though that didn't include breakfast. We were happier eating out in whatever cafe we found. so I don't know how the food was there. They also arranged an airport shuttle for us (13 Euro) and had free wi-fi and a computer inthe lobby. I would stay there again.

<Content>Good base My Girlfriend  I stayed here back in Nov 06. We found the Hotel very comfortable, clean, tidy and in a quiet street. It is located approx 20 minute walk south of Leidseplein, but if you don't feel like walking then there is a tram stop nearby.I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to have a relaxed stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Loved the Park Plaza This is a lovely hotel.if you get to Central Station - go to the newsagents kiosk and buy a Strippenkarten (a strip of 15 tram rides). Go out of Central Station and get on the number 2 tram (you don't need to check which direction it is going, they all go the same way from CS). There will be a booth where you get your ticket stamped on the tram - you need to get into the tram at the back (not the front) where the booth is with the conductor in. The conductor will stamp 2 lines (ie just stamp no. 2, not no.1). The hotel is in zone 1, and zone 1 equals 2 lines. Two people can travel on the card - so the conductor should stamp line 2 and line 4.You go thru Dam Square, then Leisdsplein (plein is square) then get off at Emmastraatt. The hotel is just about 20 seconds walk from Emmastraat. Keep walking along the main road in the direction the tram is leaving and the hotel is about 5 buildings on your right, just round the corner.Number 2 tram goes back into Dam Square and Leidsplein for sightseeing. Also if you walk down the cul de sac opposite the tram stop (with the De Telegraph shop on the corner) you can easily get into Vondel Park. It is a nice walk thru Vondel Park down to Leisplein too.The hotel is lovely - front desk staff speak excellent english. B'fast was not included, but we knew that when we booked and paid at reception. Was 12.50 euros/person. Good continental buffet, but not much hot food. We were in the annex which was an upgraded room to a superior. Was lovely - modern bathroom, with big rain shower, only a shower no bath but shampoo/shower gel incl. Hairdryer, fridge and safe included.Would thoroughly recommend this hotel. One restaurant just over the road from the hotel - De'leete (Reception will point it out) but it is very easy to jump on tram no. 2 down a few stops and get off between the hotel and Leidsplein where there are nice restaurants/cafes on the corners of the road, or stay on the tram to Leisplein which is a tourist paradise for any sort of food.Any questions, do ask through Tripadvisor, I will be very happy to help.To sum up, the hotel is not right in the centre, but if you are happy to get the tram (which are easy and very efficient) you will love it. Enjoy ....

<Content>I loved this place! I loved this hotel! Since I was by myself I had a single room with a twin but was happy that it was a very big full-size bed. The comforter was big and fluffly and so were the pillows. My bathroom was spotless (remember that in Europe sometimes, H means cold and C means hot). I had a decent-sized flat screen television with cable and even got a few English-speaking stations but didn't watch too much TV. There was a hot water tea kettle in the room and they provided coffee and tea packets. While I was there it got very hot and I was glad the room had air conditioning even though the window opened which was also nice. My room was cleaned every day.In the lobby you can purchase sodas and light snacks or get complimentary coffee, espresso, or tea. They also have a computer to use at no charge and newspapers to read. The lobby was very clean also. All the staff I dealt with were very nice and all spoke English.The hotel is in a very quiet section of Amsterdam so you don't have to worry about noise from late-night party people. It is very close to Vondel Park (which is also very nice) and the museum section. It is a VERY short walk to the tram stop which is on the number 2 line which is a straight shot to about everything. Also around the corner a short distance is a small grocery store. I really can't understand the negative reviews; I feel as though there are some people you just can't please. This hotel stacked up to any American hotel. (I've been to Europe before so I know that a hotel there can be a nightmare but this one was great).

<Content>Disappointing The room was very small (room 652). 'Bathroom' was bad; no privacy at all (glass wall) and smelled very bad during the night. Couldn't turn off the airco, very chilly while sleeping. No breakfast included. Yes, it was modern (flatscreen tv)...but it was disappointing to me. I'm glad we only stayed for 1 night.Wouldn't recommend this at all!

<Content>Great hotel for the price! This was a suprisingly pleasant stay. I was a little nervous walking through the hallways, but when we got into the room it was extremely clean with a large shower. The hotel does not have any parking but we were able to park on the street for 13 Euros per day (a great price for city parking) and since the hotel is in a fantastic neighborhood we weren't worried about the car. It's a bit of a walk from the hotel to get to the sights such as Dam Square, but the tram picks up just around the corner which makes it extremely easy to get around. Staff were exceedingly helpful and breakfast was great more than just continental. Will stay here again if we make it back to Amsterdam.

<Content>Hated The Rodents!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God I don't know where to start!!!!! The room was filthy with mould in the bathroom and stains on the bedding!!!!! There was a rodent in the room and to be honest i wasn't sure if it was a rat or a mouse!!!!! Towels not changed!!!! Hidious price for breakfast!!!!! Stinkiing dirty carpets!!!!! We paid for three rooms but upon check out they told us we'd only paid for two rooms!!!! We had proof of confirmation on us and it was only when i threatened to start shouting about the rodent situation that we had things resolved.............eventually!!!! WE only just made it to the airport on time because it took so long and the staff on reception were so arrogant!!!!!I would never visit this hotel again and it has put me off ever going to Amsterdam again!!!!! The reason we went in the first place was to celebrate my parents Ruby anniversary and i don't think any of us expected to be staying in a hostel when they stated it was a four star hotel!!!When booking and paying for room on internet in full we were then told on checkout that only two rooms had been paid for.All I can say is that maybe Stevie Wonder gave this hostel a four star rating and perhaps he was having sinus problems at the time so he couldn't smell how stinking it was!!!!!!

<Content>nice hotel in quiet area This hotel is located in a quiet residential area (oud zuid) by vondel park on the edge of the museum area. The rooms are clean, beds comfortable and the tv carries a variety of channels incl. BBC world, CNN and discovery channel. English and us shows are subtitled in dutch. The staff is friendly and helpful.An Albert Hein supermarket is located on the corner of emma straat and J. Verhulst Straat. There are 2 restaurants at this intersection as well. A third restaurant is located on the corner of valerius straat right across from the hotel. At the intersection ef koninginneweg and emma laan the sandwich shop yours truly and a couple of other small convenience stores can be found. At the intersection of koninginneweg and amstelveneense weg you can find a bank, post office and a photgraphy shop with one hour service for developement. For a nice restaurant try POMPA at willemsparkweg 6 at the intersection af willemsweg and van baerle straat. In the city try restaurant de spiegel at lijnbaansgracht 277. Be advised there are two small draw backs with regards to this hotel. The location is not central so there is little to do in the evening. If you want to go out you have to go to the city centre. It is easy by tram but trhe trams stop running at midnight so you need a cab to go back and they can be difficult to obtain at night.Second, acces to the lobby is not easy. The stairs are smooth and high and there is no ramp. You have to carry your luggage up a couple of step steps so if you have a difficulty walking this place is not a good choice For transportation tram line no. 2 stops less than 100 meters from the hotel. This line runs through the city center to the central station Good bookstores are waterstones kalverstraat 152 and american book center spui 12.For perfumes and other gifts for wives try leidsstraat 74 - 76.For shopping in general try area around prinsen gracht, keisergracht, leidseplein, spui and damFor transportation and discounts at sights by an amsterdam cardYou can get it opposit the central station.Great sights are the rijks museum, amsterdam historical museum, canal trip, the amsterdam museum ship (replica of merchant vessel) and the artis zoo.

<Content>Try to get a suite Stayed here last weekend and really liked the hotel. Was in a great location and the number 2 tram took you to the centre every 10 mins. Got an upgrade to one of the business suites which was really spacious and had a great jacquizzi in the bath room. The staff were really nice and helpful. Didnt sample the food but there are great places to eat in Amsterdam. Very comfy beds to boot.

<Content>I Hated This Place I booked this hotel for my husband and I through an United Airlines offer. It seemed really reasonably priced, the pictures on the web site showed a really nice modern room and it was close to my friend's apartment who we were planning to visit. When we got there, the woman at the front desk was terribly rude, and told us that the only room they had available at the rate I'd book at was one with two twins. I pulled out my confirmation for a room with a queen bed and wouldn't give in. She then wanted to show us another, larger room we could have for just 50 Euros more a night. Sorry, we didn't want to pay more, we just wanted the room we'd already booked. She then showed us to a room that wasn't renovated and really gross in a building next to the hotel. Well, there was no way we were going to stay there, so I asked to talk to the manager. I just wasn't going to back down on this one. Finally we were taken to a tiny, tiny modern room, (it was smaller than hotel rooms I've stayed in in NYC), but it was renovated and cozy so we took it. But I vowed to let people know what a horrible experience we had. My friend who lives in town said she'd never known the hotel to be so unfriendly or the rooms to be that small. Amsterdam is such a wonderful city with lots of hotels 鈥?don't go through the hassel of staying at this Park Plaza.

<Content>OK, but some problems! I stayed in the hotel for 5 days in March 2008 while on a business trip in amsterdam. The neighborhood is out of the city center area but two tram stops 2 and 16 are closeby to get you to the city center in 15-20 minutes. tram 2 stop is a block away and tram 16 stop is 2.5 blocks away. there are a few resturants around but not too many to choose from so that's something to consider if you dont want to go to the city center for each meal! the hotel only serves breakfast but no lunch or dinner. the buffet breakfast is pretty expensive at 17 euros so i didnt try it. there was another option for a package of continental breakfast delivered to your room for 7 euros (juice, fruit yogurt, chocolate bar, a fruit, and a hard broiled egg, a criossant plus jam and butter). there was an espresso maker in the room that made great espressos.The entrace door is 5 stairs above the ground and you have to carry your baggage up to the stairs (no ramps or elevators, etc.). The first thing that i noticed when i entered the lobby: the horrible smell of cigarrates, which was always present both in the lobby and the hallways (even the hallways of non-smoking floors). the receptionist lady was nice and helpful. there was free wireless interent in the lobby but not in all the rooms. i asked to see if they had a room with wireless access and i was told that the rooms on the second floor had wireless, so i asked to be moved to the second floor and after 20 minutes of wait, they gave me a room with wireless access on the second floor. it was worth the wait. my room was facing the main street infront of the hotel and was terribly noisy. i could hear the cars and the tram passing by all evening. also, the doors of the rooms didn't have slam stoppers so each time anyone closed a door, you would hear a big slam, day and night which was very annoying. the bathroom was renovated and nice and clean although very small which was ok for me. the room was clean although the carpet was not new and had some spots on it. there was no iron in the room and i had to ask the reception to give ma an iron and ironing board. there was no fridge or microwave in the room. Not even an alarm clock so i had to request wake-up calls from the reception. So, overall, i would say that the hotel was quite average if it didn't have the noise problems but with all the noise, i have to say that it was a bit below average.There was a shuttle to and from the airport which costed 13.5 each way. to get to the airport from the hotel you could book the shuttle 2 hours before your departure time. it was a very good option. To get to the hotel from the airport, i took a cab to the hotel which costed 35 euros (as i didn't know about the shuttle).

<Content>You get what you pay for (nothing more, nothing less) Booked 4 nights at the Park Plaza for about $85 a night, received a discount due to a 4 night stay. The hotel is just south of the beautiful Vondel Park in Amsterdam and is rated as three stars. Hotel has free WIFI in lobby and in small working area near elevators in basement which was convenient although if you went online in the lobby you had to put up with all the smokers. Also, the hotel had one public computer in the lobby for guests use.  The room was typically small twin bed in the European style. When we walked in it did have a funky mildew smell to it although it looked nice. the room did have a bathroom and a shower although it was unlike anything I had seen before. The bathroom and shower were enclosed in a frosted glass next to the bed and there was about a 3 foot gap between the top of the glass and ceiling. Nothing horrible, however if you shared the room with someone it is not that private. Didn't eat in the hotel because it was $16 euros for breakfast when you could make a right out of the hotel and go to the bakery a hundred yards down on the opposite side of the street for a much cheaper option. There was a vending machine near the elevators which ahd candy and sodas for $1 euro a piece. Getting around Amsterdam was easy because the #2 tram Emmasraat stop was about 50 yards from the front of the hotel and the museum square area was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The only drawback was that the tram stopped running after midnight however there are night buses that run on the main street just south of the hotel and stop at Emmastraat. Be advised that we were charged a $1.50 euro night-surcharge a person in addition to our regular tram strippenkart to ride the night buses.  Overall, the hotel met my expectations for what we paid for. Nothing more, nothing less.

<Content>Clean and adequate hotel with nice staff Before arriving at this hotel I had mixed reviews on reading tips from trip advisor. To be honest it does depend on the kind of person you are and what level of service you know you can deal with. I'm the type of person that cannot deal with unclean and shabby looking places-first impressions really do count. I regard myself as a person who has high expectations, and so do those who know me. I didn't get my sights set too hight on this place due to the different revies but known that i read it was clean, i took the chance and boy was I glad. Set in a great area ten minutes tram ride (TRAM NO 2 which is just ouste the hotel and cost 1 euro 60 ) to and from the center of town know as the great Vondel park-so pretty- you are arms lenght from the hussle and bussle of everybody in town and also have the upside of relaxing in the quieter part of where the hotel is. don't buy breakfast in the holet over priced and tastes of cardboard, there are great places to eat just two tram stops away from hotel _which youcan walk in two mins- and are much more value for money.This hotel's location sold me, the only thing about it was we satyed in one of the rooms(230) which was on the main road side and could hear traffic all day and night long, it is bearable, but hotel really should invest in better glass of sound proofing for windows. overall had great two night stay and returning there again in november for round two of amsterdam!! have a great trip...you will ove it!

<Content>Okay room but terrible staff Frankly this is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a hotel.I stayed here on a recent trip to Amsterdam for business. I was travelling with a work colleague and requested a twin room when I made the booking. I rang and emailed before I arrived to check the twin bed request which was confirmed.I was therefore annoyed that on arrival we had a double, two twins joined together. On asking for a twin room I was told that this is all they had left. I had made the booking 3 months earlier!Secondly the overall attitude of the staff was appalling. Very few smiles and complete lack of effort for any kind of customer service. One particular receptionist just scowled at us all the time like a cross school teacher! Another ignored my colleague for our whole stay after he refused to join their hotel points scheme.The 2 stars I will give this hotel is for the room which although small and rather dated was generally clean and comfortable.I will not be going back and recommend that you don鈥檛 stay here. There are far nicer hotels in Amsterdam.

<Content>Very nice place overall My boyfriend was traveling to Amsterdam for work and the university there booked this hotel for us. We were pleasantly surprised at how large the room was. We also had a large balcony with a wicker table and chairs off the back. The room was outdated, but it appears that they are doing some renovations in the building we were in and perhaps this room has yet to be updated. It was a bit noisy since we were right by the elevator, but the traffic in and out was minimal so the noise was not so much a bother. It is really close to the number 2 tram line which was convenient. I would recommend this to anyone.

<Content>Peace by the Park My partner and I have just had an enjoyable couple of days in Amsterdam staying at the Vondel Park Plaza. We appreciated its location next to the green, peaceful park. Yes, we had two single beds pushed together and the duvets were unseasonably warm but staff responded promptly and politely to our request for alternative bedding. The room was big enough, quiet and immaculate and the Hot Deal prices were good value. The nearby Film Museum in Vondel Park has friendly restaurant/cafe staff and shows free outside films in the summer - worth a visit.

<Content>Better than expected... Just returned from one week holiday ... 4 nights in total at the Park Plaza Vondel, Amsterdam (2 nights there, then 3 nights in Brugge, Belgium, then returned for a final 2 nights again at the Park Plaza). Very leary about this hotel after reading all the negative reviews, but then decided to trust our travel agent, and the fact that I think my husband and I are less finicky about our accomodations than some other tourists ... we just wanted clean, comfortable, with modern amenities, and that is what we got. It was also quite a reasonable rate for Amsterdam. Arrived in Amsterdam from Toronto at 6am on a Saturday. We had requested early check-in, and I was very skeptical that we would get, but to our delight, our room was ready. The one thing that did stand out to me was that as we entered the front lobby of the hotel, there was an overwhelming stench of urine, however it must have been dealt with shortly thereafter, because that was the one and only incidence. Based on others' reviews and tales of small, stuffy rooms and poor air circulation, we had also requested a room with AC in the 'new' or 'renovated' part of the hotel, which again, to my surprise, we were granted - and the AC worked wonders. The room itself was TINY! (Rm.526). A double bed pushed in the corner and about 2-3 feet to walk around it on either side. But we were not planning to spend much time there anyway. No complaints about the washroom - small, but not terribly tiny - excellent amenities - modern, clean, good water pressure, good hair dryer and a mirror spanning one entire wall of the washroom. (Girls, the corridors of the hotel have full-length mirrors up and down them as part of the decor, so I would sometimes pop into the hall for that final outfit check!). Mattress was a bit hard (my husband complained about a sore back), but not terrible... we definitely had a number of good night sleeps! Overall, it was better than I was expecting and we were happy to return to the Park Plaza for the final 2 nights of our stay in Amsterdam!Location is good - very quiet, but definitely not central. We had perfect spring weather so we chose to walk a lot, but that is also a great way to explore the city. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseums; 30 minutes to the Leidseplein. The hotel backs onto Vondel Park, so we also got to explore this beautiful, picturesque park. We enjoyed our walks, but it was also easy to jump on the tram (#2) to take you to the Centre. We did this to go to Central Station one day, then made our way back through the city, ie. through the Red Light District, etc. I think I would stick with this location next time, maybe a tad closer to the centre would be nice, but the peace and quiet was just right. A great holiday. Pleasantly surprised.

<Content>Good hotel, great location We needed a break and though that Amsterdam in the spring would do itnicely. We ended up booking the park plaza through expedia after a lot of to and from with booking sites offering unbelieveable deal on the 5* hotels in AMS that were then not available due to 'technical issues'......Getting there: Having read reviews about the taxis being a ripoff, we decided on using public transport. it took a while to figure out and we eventually made it to the hotel after going via the central station. Despite speaking/reading German it wasn't that obvious how to get there, but various passers by were able to give direction in English. In hindsight, I think I'd just negotiate a deal with a cab at the airport as the trains took at least 90 mins by the time we figured them out and did everything we needed to. By contrast the cab back took 15 mins!!!Location: The hotel itself is in a great part of town, right next to the Vondelpark and in easy walking distance of some top spots for breakfast or if you want to eat on the hoof, theres a beautiful patisserie about 10 mins away (walk 2 tram stops back towards town, turn right and keep going - patisserie is on the right - theres also a launderette and a chemist around there). Its an upmarket area, quiet and clean.Rooms: We got a room the far end of the hotel #351 - that is to say we were in the building furthest from town. Good enough would be the summary I'd give them. The bathroom did it's job, towels were clean, shower worked well, even if a bit temperamental about whether to run hot or cold! The hair dryer was a bit puny (girls, bring your own if you want dry hair). The decor was rather..... orange...refurbneeded in terms of style but in upkeep it was OK. You get a teeny telly, who cares about TV when you're on holiday though. The mini barwas empty, but again, who cares - you're on hols, go to a bar if you want a drink! One gripe that I share with other reviews is that the beds are singles pushed together so not exactly comfortable if you want to curl up together of a night. The other moan with the beds is a common one in European hotels - the pillows are useless and you only get one. We requested extras (3 times) and got them immediatelyafter snapping at reception on the phone.Service: apart from having to ask several times for extra pillows, they were great. I bought a huge Vanda orchid in the flower market which they put in a safe spot for me when we left our luggage. We were able to borrow umbrellas from them for no charge - just as well since it pee'd down when we were there. Local knowledge was good, directions accurate. nothing to complain about really.General things: Don't bother with the airport shuttle, it didn't showup for us either - we got a cab to take us both back for 鈧?5 so that was a lot better. Not the hotels fault, but worth a mention. Public transport is great in AMS, we went all over the place on the trams and by buying the strip tickets it was a doddle to hop on and off, not that we ever worked out the charging, but at 鈧?.50 a strip we weren't fussed. Most of the time we just walked around and soaked it all up.The town itself can be a bit confusing to get around so pickup a decent map from somewhere.Coffee shops - actually its not so easy to find one that just sells coffee. Most of them are full of smokers! if thats what you want, you'll be spoiled for choice all over town. If you want a sit down coffee and cake experience, you'll need to keep your eyes peeled a bit more! might seem an odd statement, but thats how we found it.Red Light District: an odd place and well worth a visit even if just to satisfy your curiosity. Keep your guard up, your purse closed and your wallet in tight pockets - you know you're being watched by the pickpockets and 'unsavoury characters'. Night time is most interesting as you can wander through the groups egging each other on, the blind drunk moaning that they wasted 鈧?0 as they couldn't perform and watch the girls working hard to draw in the punters (competition is strong so they'l put on a performance).Canal trips: We did a day one as the heavens opened upon us and wished we'd done the night trip too. Due to where we were in town at the time we ended up on the TUI one right by the main station. there was commentary in english and they tell you a lot of facts. Quite interesting all in all.Crossing the road: Good luck! between trams, psycholists as we ended up naming them, and cars, crossing the road is a lottery. The bikes were the worst as you don't hear them coming - stop, look, listen!Diamonds: Interesting to visit the diamond workers/show, but don't buy from them. You're paying extra for the nice show they put on for the hundreds of others who don't buy anything. Gassan was the most interesting and they show you some stunning stones. We were shown a 鈧?2,000 2carat rock and even I, who is not jewellery minded was drawnto it. They offer a shuttle bus service and the reception in the hotel will hand you a leafletEnjoy amsterdam, its a very cool city :o)

<Content>A good night's sleep! We were a little perplexed at the huge differences in peoples' commentary for this hotel, but decided to take a chance and book it anyway. (If anyone wants to do the same, can I suggest you visit the hotel's website as they do some good deals if you book in advance for weekend breaks)We spent 2 nights at the Vondel Park Plaza, and although it was a little more out of town than expected, it was only 2 mins walk from the tram stop that takes you right through to Centraal station and the location is right next to the pretty Vondel Park - so any grievances about far-out locations were offset by how quiet it was at night and that you can wander the length of the park to get to the Rijksmuseum. Our room was a standard one and although admittedly in need of a refit and a dab of paint to rescue it from an 80's timewarp it wasnt too small and had a good shower with excellent water pressure. It was very clean and quite airy too.We didnt book breakfast, but as you are in such a nice residential neighbourhood, there are some nice little delis and cafes to explore with good breakfast menus. Try the one next to the tram stop as they have a breakfast menu too.In short I would recomnend the Vondel Park Plaza if decor aesthetics arent very important to you and you dont mind being too far out of town!

<Content>Terrible room Our room was small and incredibly dated. Think early 1990's formica. Chipped paint and peeling wallpaper. The bathroom had tiles missing, the trouser press didn't work and the mini bar was empty, just as well as it had frozen solid. Being English we took our own Tea bags for our morning brew but these we taken away by the chambermaid. We did complain and it took 2 days for replacements to be found. I had to call out a Doctor. Reception arranged this and told be there would be a 40 euro call out fee. It was 100 Euros! Finally we booked the shuttle bus to take us to the airport via reception. Dispite confirming our booking earlier in the day the bus failed to show .. We had to 'get a cab. which was much more expensive.

<Content>very disappoited We booked a four night stay in a superior room, with double bed. When we arrived we were shown into a very small claustrophobic room which had twin beds.When we complained about the beds we were shown a room with a double bed and again it was claustrophobic, about 3 metres by 3.5 metres and the bed was against the wall. The room was in the roof space and the ceiling slopped over the bed which didn't help. We were not happy with this but no other rooms were available that night but staff agreed to show us another room the next day. We were ultimately shown a business suite which involved us 'upgrading' but due to inconvenience caused we were not charged the full amout for it. This room was comfortable. The glass walls to the bathroom can be off putting. The hotel is about 15-20 minutes walk into the centre but is near to a tram stop. Coffee shops/bars while walking into town are very good and staff very helpful. Despite a good outcome to our situation though, we would not book this hotel again.

<Content>ok My partner and i went to the Vondel Park Plaza for New Year. The hotel itself is in a lovely area in amsterdam. There is a tram a minutes walk away which takes you in to the centre but we walked to the centre everyday and it took us about 25 minutes. When i initially read other peoples reviews regarding the room temperatures at night i thought they must have been overexagerating but after spending 3 nights there i understand, the room was far too hot and stuffy, the radiator was never on once and we had to sleep with the window wide open. the rooms are very basic we booked a superior room but got a room with 2 very uncomfy single beds!!!! the bar was nice and cosy and that is where we brought new year in. the staff were all very friendly also. if you are looking for a cheap basic hotel this wi;ll be fine but for a little more luxury i think id prefer the marriot.

<Content>A rather un-memorable experience We booked this hotel through Priceline. It seems nothing in Amsterdam is cheap and after months of trying to lowball Priceline for a 4-5 star hotel, I finally upped my bid price and dropped a level in quality which is how I ended-up with 4 rooms at the Vondel Park Plaza.Part of my disappointment is due to my own stupidity, aka cheapness, in deciding to haul our suitcases from Schiphol to Central Station via the train. From there we had to wrestle or bags over cobblestones and tram tracks to catch the #2 tram which took us eventually to within just a few feet of the hotel. Neither the train nor the tram are conducive to this type of activity - nowhere to safely put your bags so you're stuck standing next to them the whole way.It was another hassle dragging the bags up 7-8 steps (no handicap ramp) to the hotel entrance. Inside, the lobby is rather small but clean and comfortable. The staff was very professional and helpful. In fact , even though it was only 10:30 am when we showed-up, we were given rooms. And we were assured that even if the rooms hadn't been ready, the hotel would let us leave our bags while we spent the rest of the day sightseeing.The rooms were on the 4th floor but two elevators made access easy. The rooms were on the quiet back side of the hotel, overlooking the park. The rooms themselves weren't anything special, and were actually rather small. But they were clean and in good repair. My single bed wasn't as firm as I would like nor was the comforter anywhere near as plush as most, but I still ended-up well-rested. The bathrooms were small, but the plumbing worked well with plenty of hot water and strong shower flow.I might have called this hotel above average had they thrown in a free breakfst, or if it were closer to the Damrak area or if the rooms were spectacular. I found nothing particularly wrong with the place but two years ago I paid $20 a night less for rooms at the Amsterdam Renaissance which was an infinitely classier establishment.Based on what was available to us this year the Vondel Park Plaza was about as good as we could expect, but when I go on holiday I expect more.

<Content>Good Hotel Just back from a 5 day break in Amsterdam. Stayed at the VondelPark Plaza. I cant say anything bad about this hotel, rooms were clean, towels changed everyday(if needed), room was comfortable and had TV. My only reservation at first was the Glass door for the bathroom, but as a couple staying here this wasn't really a problem. Didn't have breakfast at the hotel, went to nearby Leidisplein for this where you will find a plentiful supply of restaurants and bars.Tram is only 2 minutes walk from hotel and will take you through Leidisplein and all stops past Dam Square to the Central Station. I would advise getting the'STRIP' pass for the trams, well worth the money(you can purchase this at the ticket office across from the Central Station for around 11 Euros)I have to admit that we walked almost everywhere without a problem, just watchout for the Bike riders, they take no prisoners.I would recomend visiting the Anne franks house, well worth the 7.50 euros. Cheers

<Content>Quiet area but easy access to all sights We stayed here as a family with two adjacent rooms. Our double was quite roomy with the glass walled bathroom which other reviewers have commented about. Personally we found it fine. The childrens' room though was definitely on the small side and the storage area was difficult to use. Perhaps this variation in rooms accounts for the differing reviews which this hotel gets. The hotel is situated in a residential area next to the Vondelpark (lovely for a stroll but mind the bikes!) but only a few yards from a tram stop which whisks you quickly into the city centre. The staff were just about acceptable but were neither particularly swift or efficient at the front desk. Avoid the breakfast at all costs unless it is included in your room rate as it is not worth the money. They stopped replenishing the buffet half an hour before it was due to close so late comers went away empty handed. The quality was mediocre and dining room service poor with uncleared tables everywhere. We paid 拢100 per room which was not cheap but it was high season. I have stayed here previously out of season for under 拢70. The breakfast was an unfortunate blot on what was otherwise a very pleasant stay and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very disappointing We booked this hotel based on the reviews we had read but was very disappointed with what we found. We booked two superior rooms, paying the same price for each. I was in a couple and given a room just big enough to house a double bed. Our single travelling companion was given a single room with about two feet square of floor space and a shower that flooded the whole room when used.We complained immediately to the reception staff but they were very unhelpful saying that the hotel was fully booked and there was no duty manager we were able to speak to. The next day we did get through to the manager who changed our rooms for two descent sized doubles but they were filthy. The bath was full of hair and there were nail clippings on the carpet! One of the rooms did not have bedding and when it did arrive we were handed the duvet and covers separately and left to get on with making it ourselves.On the plus side the hotel is located in a nice area of Amsterdam and the park behind the hotel is lovely to walk through towards the centre.The hotel is due to close for (much needed) refurbishment in November and I got the distinct feeling that the staff had lost interest in doing their jobs properly until then. I certainly would not return.

<Content>hot nights The hotel was actually pretty nice. The outside looks very respectable and the inside does also. Our room was typical euro small. we reserved a double bed but got two singles pushed together. It was in a respectable area of town (i.e. no homeless or anything like that). But nothing is close. there a few places within walking distance but nothing really close. plan to walk at least 20 mins each way to the van gogh museum. the worst thing was that at night if the day was hot the rooms become ovens. our room had a little window that did not do anything. my advice is bring your own fan. youll thank me later. if you dont care about taking a tram in and out of town and you bring a fan than the hotel is good, but over priced.

<Content>excellent location Just returned from a long weekend in Amsterdam with the girls. After cancelling one hotel on Damrak (after advice from a mate who had just returned!!) I stumbled across Vondel Park Plaza. We were not dissapointed. The location was great, either a 15 minute slow walk or 5 minute tram ride from the bars, museums etc. Vondel Park is right behind the hotel you can walk through this great park to the bars etc although you have to watch out for the kamikaze cyclists!! The hotel staff were really friendly, the rooms were clean, only problem was we did not have air conditioning and it was boiling! I would definately recommend this hotel and will return.

<Content>Good hotel, good location, poor bed situation. We stayed in this pleasant hotel for three nights during a lovely sunny June. I had already read the reviews so know what to expect. We stayed in a 'Superior' room and got what I considered to be a reasonable deal on flight with room included. My review is based on this.The location of the hotel was perfect. It was close to the centre but away from any noise. You can reach the centre via a short tram ride (less than 5 minutes) costing 1.6 Euros. The tram station is about 200m around the corner. Otherwise you can walk the distance in 30 minutes. The hotel is very clean and the room in great condition. We didn't use the restaurant facilities as I expected it to be costly. There are a few breakfast places nearby. My only complaint is that there was not a real double bed in the room, only two singles pushed together. This is ok as long as you don't intend getting intimate (honeymooners beware). There was a fridge in the room as well as a kettle and a TV, with the BBC tuned in. My recommendation would be to rent a bike for 8 Euros per day and use that to get around. There is a great Irish bar down the road that can be reached in 2 minutes by bike. Over all a great hotel that would have been perfect with a real double bed.

<Content>Worth the walk! I was really, REALLY pleased with this hotel!Accomodations: clean, modern, very nice.Staff: friendly, albeit a tad indifferent times, but not unhelpful.Location: A very short walk from the #2 tram, and a nice walk to the Museumplein. Far enough away from the downtown craziness to be peaceful and relaxed, but not so far that you were wishing you had a bike to get to the action faster.Cons? If you need to use the internet, there's often a line for the one computer available. Also, there are not many shops/stores in the area, nor places to eat, so plan on trekking a few blocks north in order to get anything you might need. Snacks in the hotel are limited, though there is a restaurant/cafe (which we did not make use of).Overall, it was great.

<Content>Great place to stay I stayed at this Hotel for three nights in April. I found it very nice. It was clean and the staff were very helpfull. Its in an upmarket part of Amsterdam and threfore very safe and quiet especially at night. The No2 tram is literally 1 minute away and it only takes ten or so minutes to get into the centre of Amsterdam.It has recently changed it name from the Ramada to the Vondel Park, which was slightly confusing but I would not hesitate to stay here again.A very enjoyable stay.

Small cosy bar with lovely gas fire - perfect for relaxing with a drink after a days sightseeing. All staff very friendly and helpful. #2 Tram very convenient for getting to dam square and great value. Slightly disappointed when we went for breakfast at 9.15am and found there was no bacon, sausages or eggs left so appear early for breakfast if you want this!! Would stay in this hotel again as nice and quiet at night.

<Content>A great base to explore Amsterdam If you want a warm, clean, relatively quiet hotel that's within walking distance of the Centraal, Ramada is perfect. (We stayed at Ramada Hotel and Suites - there are 2 other Ramadas in Amsterdam.) If you can't be bothered to walk through the lovely Vondelpark, you can catch the Number 2 tram just up the road, on the opposite side from the hotel.As the other reviews say, breakfast is expensive but this isn't a problem - turn left out of the hotel, take the first right down Emmastraat and there's an Albert Heijn supermarket. Here you can buy croissants, juice, beer, wine, bread, etc and even a bottle opener/corkscrew. Plates and cutlery are available for free in the small shop by reception.For a decent evening meal, and the full 'gezellig' eating/drinking experience, walk up the Willemspark Straat to Pompa, a lovely little eatery.(While you're online, go to Amsterdam.info for an excellent free map of the city. Don't be tight, print it all out.)One small gripe. Be prepared to pay 'city tax' at the end of your stay. This is levied by the hotel and varies in amount. We stayed five nights and were charged 21 euros. Ouch.The Ramada is well-located, in a pleasant neighbourhood and has polite, helpful staff. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Good value, but dont stay in room #48 I have stayed at this hotel before, years ago when it was the Cok Hotel. Stayed in the reception building then, the room was a good value, nice view from back of hotel of Vondelpark. This time I stayed in the other building (no reception desk) the room was clean, had a nice view of Vondelpark. The room really nothing fancy, bed was okay, great heating system. The BIGGEST complaint I will have with Room #48 is the elevator shaft is right next door - this has to be one of the noisiest elevators ever! You could hear it stop on EVERY floor, and was particularly busy between 12am and 2am for some reason - folks must stay out late! If you are a VERY sound sleeper, then take #48 by all means. It is on top floor, so you won't be disturbed by anyone above!The #2 streetcar convenient and stops less than 1/2 block away (Emmastraat) - there arent many bakeries nearby to get a morning quickie/snack. The bagged breakfast from the hotel ($15 euro) was okay. There was a small fridge in the room too. Other minors - the built-in alarm clock (looks like from the 1980's) does not work, and do bring your own washcloths - they apparently don't provide here.

<Content>Can not recommend Booked a non smoking room. Was told upon arrival that only smoking rooms were available. Room itself is sufficient size, however, not enough light whatsoever. Staff impersonal and not at all helpful. Internet service is available in lobby, however, I had to pay 10 Euros for 45 minutes. Internet connection was a dial up, so VERY SLOW. Did not eat breakfast at hotel. 15 Euros to steep. Save your money and take the tram to Leidenstein (spelling?) and eat at the Pancake House. No American outlets available (was prepared for that, but thought I should still point that out). Could not in good faith ever recommend this hotel. Left after 2 nights and booked into a Best Western by the airport. That hotel was a 100% better.

<Content>A fine place a little outside the city centre We were given a room in the same building as reception, towards the back of the building. It was quiet, clean and the decor suited our taste (modern and efficient). Though the location is a bit outside the city centre, it is very convenient to the #2 tram and walking distance to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum. After a day with the crowds in town it was nice to get some quiet at night. Though we only dropped into to Vondelpark it was literally on our doorstep.The staff were efficient, helpful and generally friendly.Breakfast was a bit steep at EUR 15 per person - we didn't eat at the hotel but we saw why they can charge a lot as there isn't any place nearby to eat in the morning.Overall we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Perfectly acceptable We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in July 2005, in the same building as the check-in lobby. The room was fairly new and clean, with modern bathroom trimmings. The best part was discovering what a great neighborhood was to stay while visiting Amsterdam. It is quiet, upscale, residential, right near Vondel Park, allowing us a quiet respite from the rest of the city. At the same time, you are close enough via the frequent trams to explore all the tourist trapping as you wish.

<Content>erm rooms good corridors not very just been reading the reviews when i can across the 3rd one down and am amazed that someone else noticed the smell!!! i thought that it was just me. we did have a good room though it was in the basement and the GLASS bathroom door wouldnt lock however the room was massive it was a smoking room however none of us that stayed there smoked.I thought the hotel was really far out as it took nearly 1 hour to walk to damm square but we cant really complain as we were upgraded to this hotel for free so not all bad but more out of the Leidsplien than i wanted to be really.But Breakfasts were good and bar is reasonably prices with a little varanda out to the back.Tram were very reqular so that made it good and there is a nice takeaway down the road cant remember name but starts with an A that is great value for money as we couldnt find any food in the hotel.But the rooms are ok not priveate with the door and the staff are really great as they will do anything for you.Its worth going to if you dont want to stay in Amsterdam city.one good thing is you can have free breakfats in bed!!!!! always a good thing!

<Content>Dozens of great stays - professional traveler From our FIRST honeymoon visit in 1988, until my last visit in 2000,the COK hotel has always been my favorite (12+ times). Living in MEM,we're forced to use AMS as our gateway to Europe  Asia. Whether itsa stop on the way to Beijing, Tokyo, or Kiev the COK is a great en routestop inbound/outbound our destination. With a great breakfast and excellent rooms ranging from economy/multiperson to charming smallrooms in the attic and basement, the COK is the GREATEST. It's on the#2 tram from the Central Station @ Emmastrasse next to the Vondelparkand good local restaurants. Also a short tram stop to stores and banks.

<Content>Disappointment Last year we stayed 3 nights at the Ramada hotel and suites. When we arrived, they wanted to give us a tiny room in the attic storey with a gigantic dormer window, which couldn't be opened (It looked like an attic room for domestics - terrible)! There was only a purple curtain as protection against the sun. Because there isn't any A/C, it was terribly hot in the room.When we said that we don't agree, they wanted to fob us off with a ventilator. Only when we demanded another room firmly, they gave us a normal room.This room was a little bigger but the noise from the street was very loud! There were no double bed but only two single beds which were shoved together. There surely are better hotels in Amsterdam primarily more nearly to the town! This hotel was a disappointment!
