<Content>All you could want under one roof The hotel is really big and sited within a shopping mall. The rooms are compact but nicely furnished with hot water for tea and a fridge for your own use (much cheaper idea than a minibar) There is a family mart on the ground floor which sells everything from food and beverages to souvenirs and toiletries. You can buy sandwiches and cold/hot snacks or they sell pasta dishes and casseroles that they heat up for you to take away (or eat in the small cafe area they have) all reasonably priced. The airport Limousine bus picks up and drops of at the hotel and you can buy your ticket in the reception area. There are internet terminals in the lobby which are about 100 yen for 10 minutes. The shopping mall is huge and includes a food court - MacDonalds/Subway and lots of restaurants. The train station and subway is about a 10 minute walk and you can get anywhere from there. There are lots more shops and fast food joints en route to the station etc.

<Content>Good location Okay value The room are small by Asian standards. A room with two twin beds does not have enough space to have two large luggage opened at the same time without blocking the key passage way to the front door and bathroom.The rooms are clean but nothing special.The location is fantastic as it is connected to a large mall in a more residential area of the city so the food is not so expensive. There is a 24 hr grocery store, Seiyu,just outside the mall, very close to the hotel. You must buy some of their fruits. It is fantastic. The convenience store just below the hotel is really expensive compared to Seiyu. If you are tired of the Japanese food, there is a French pastry place in the mall and it is pretty good.The service is helpful but I find the English skills poor except for one girl I met on the day I was leaving.Instead of disposable slippers, they have re-sanitized ones that look really old.You can say the subway is a little far (10 min), but there is a lot to see along the way, and most of it is part of the mall which travels underground towards the subway station. The station is also part of the JR Yamanote line which is an added convenience.I also stayed at the Grand Prince Akasaka for the same price and they were better in all categories except for transportation. So for the same price this is not good value.

<Content>Good value Stayed here twice, once in 2006 and then last year in 2007 as part of a JAL vacation package. Overall, the value of the room when part of the JAL package is quite good at about $70-$80/night. Though the property is part of a modern tower development and shopping complex in Ikebukoro, the hotel is a blast from the past (late 80's??).  Though the rooms are exceptionally tiny when compared to western hotels, they offer all the basic amenities including the TOTO washlet toilets which, well........do more than flush. I'd recommend this for solo, young travelers looking for an affordable option close to the Yamanote line. johnnyc

<Content>Standard tourist-class hotel. Huge hotel connected to a huge-r shopping complex, and also located very very close by a pedastrian shopping area (area around Ikebukuro metro station).Rooms looked dated, but this was to be expected from a regular tourist-oriented hotel.Beds and amenities were standard, nothing spectacular, but always kept clean and tidy by housekeeping.Breakfast spread was ho-hum too, very ordinary and not the most exciting. The variety of food included the usual stuff like eggs, toast, pain au chocolat, fruits, cereal, sausages, etc. There was a japanese breakfast section also, with porridge, salted vegetables, grilled salmon bits, seaweed, and so on.Recommended for tourists, really. Seems like the hotel is popular with tour groups, as the small-ish lobby was always crowded with such folk in the mornings and evenings.No free internet access at all! Wi-fi is chargeable, and computers downstairs charged 100 yen per 10 minutes of internet usage. Tsk!! That was rather disappointing.

<Content>Great location, nice views We stayed for three nights and had a great experience. The hotel is located very close to the Ikebukuro station, which is a link for many subway lines. There are a lot of stores, restaurants, bakeries, close by and a convenience store on the ground floor, which is a great bonus. We thought the hotel restaurants were overpriced, compared with all the other restaurants tin the Sunshine store complex and outside.The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. We stayed on the 36th floor and we could see all the way to Tokyo Tower. Have to applaud the whole chain of the hotels for their efforts to be environmentally friendly, but the hotel would benefit for a design update.

<Content>Busy crossroads The hotel was massive with a lot of rooms. We arrived past midnight, but the front dest was really not organised. The hotel had some issue with the travel agent that we had booked it through and as such we had to hang around the front desk for ages. Our biggest problem was the fact that the front office staff could speak very little English.The room itself was pretty basic. There was a mini bar but it wasn't stocked but the beds were one of the most comfortable beds I'd ever slept on.The bathroom had striking similarities to a lavatory on an airline. It was very small, but touring around Japan, I realsied that that's pretty much the normAll in all the hotel is always really busy. It's more like a bus station, and whenever I went to the lobby it was always packed with people. The hotel itself opens into a very big shopping mall and has a small convinence store located next to the restaurant. All in all the hotel was OK. Clean and comfortable, but a bit too busy for my liking.

<Content>Over-rated Good location, as it is near the Ikeburo station, and the Yamanote line runs from that station to many choice tourist locations. The hotel staff are extremely polite(this is Japan after all) and always try their best to communicate in English. Very helpful. The room, is another matter on the whole. While it is a semi-double room, it was the tiniest we have ever stayed in Japan. The passageway allowed only one person to walk through, with an aircraft size bathroom on the left. Prior to Tokyo, we had stayed at MyStays Hotel in Kyoto. While the room was small, the fittings were in good condition, clean, neat and comfortable. But Sunshine City Prince's room was terribly old, ill-designed with dirty looking carpeting. Our comforter had old stains on it, and when we called for an ironing board, a stained one was lent to us. We do laud the hotel for being a green hotel, with its concerted efforts at energy and water saving. Just wish that they will seriously look into upgrading the hotel for a more favorable stay.

<Content>spotless hotel This hotel is in a fantastic location. Ikebukuro has so many shops and great restaurants and bars. We had NYE here and found a wonderful sake and shot bar close by. The hotel was clean, comfortable and central to train and shopping. There was a convenience store in the hotel which made snacks and in hotel meals really cheap. Our only complaint was that if there were noisy neighbours in the room next door, you could hear them.

<Content>Great Location  I spent 1 week at this hotel with my family, 2kids and a wife, for the sightseeing of Tokyo. We are at the 30th floor which has a great view of Tokyo especially at night! The location is really great as it is located in the huge shopping mole building close to Ikebukuro station. The 24 hours shop is at the ground floor and in front of this hotel there is a big super market which also open 24hours.There are lots of restaurants in this building, lots of souvenir shops as well. All the staff is very polite and kind and we really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Oh, another important point is that this hotel has a direct shuttle bus from Narita Airport so we didn't suffer from the heavy and big souvenirs as check in to Hotel and the Airport Lounge is door to door. I definitely stay at this hotel for the next visit to Tokyo.

<Content>International Hotel - Great for Tourist We have stayed at the Sunshine City Prince Hotel before for business. The hotel is an older hotel. Base on what room you get it can be rather small . We like to get a corner room that has much more space. The rooms are clean and comfortable. There is a buffet breakfast that is quite good. They serve both Japanese and Western food. We prefer the Japanese breakfast. There are many tour groups that stay at this hotel which makes the hotel very English friendly. There a couple day tours that can be arranged by the hotel. It is in an area of alot of shopping and good restaurants. Also it is only a 10 minute walk to a major train station to be able to go see other parts of the city. We would suggest to get a day(s) pass for the train. This way you can get on and off the train as many times as you would like. We definitely recommend the Sunshine City Prince Hotel.

<Content>Basic Tourist Hotel Clean and plain but quite adequate. Our room was relatively small but we had a nice view across Tokyo and we could see Tokyo Tower in the distance. There were many inexpensive restaurants and many shops in the multi-level shopping center adjacent. There was a convenient supermarket across the street from the hotel on one side. For anime fans, there is a tall Ani-Mate (sp?) building across the street on another side and related businesses.This is actually in Ikebukuro suburb of Tokyo, but it is a short walk to the train station.We stayed there two days as part of a package tour, and there were crowds of other tourists there- not just Americans.

<Content>great location this was a very nice stay in the sunshine prince hotel near the ikebukuro train station...it was a great hotel to get around the city and has many small restaurants nearby and around the train station...the room was very average and on the smaller side...our room was warmer than others perhaps because we were at the end of the cooridor where the a/c did not reach... two calls to the front desk could not rectify the coolness situation, however all personnel at the hotel were especially nice and very coordial. The hotel is connected to a mall with many restaurants and stores and across the street from a supermarket that sells bentos at reasonable prices.

<Content>Not Bad, but Better Can be Found I've stayed here numerous times and would really like to give it a higher rating, but my last stay lingers too heavily on my mind. In all previous visits, we've stayed in a room that sleeps 3 so that the rooms were normal sized (for USA standards) with two beds and a fold out sofa. Also, those rooms were bright and nicely decorated. However, only double rooms were available on my last visit so we booked one. I was shocked upon entering the room. It was VERY cramped and dark. Depressing and claustrophobic actually. The rooms were clean and had refrigerators, but I'll not stay there again unless I can get a triple room. It was an entirely different hotel experience.Service has always been good here. Staff is helpful for money exchange, obtaining tickets to the airport limo bus, and answering other general questions. Although we were tourists, the hotel is mostly geared for weddings and business. However oddly enough, when we wanted to use a computer in their business center, they were closed, and there was still much afternoon left in the day! Also, they have no internet access for guests even in the computer center. Doubt that their business center is very useful.The greatest pluses of this hotel are: price, location as long as you are comfortable with the train/subway systems, and the large attached mall that has many different reasonably priced restaurants and a bakery to choose from (including a McDonalds if you are traveling with a child). There is also an aquarium on one of the top floors of the mall!Because I detested the cramped room, I won't be back unless our other favorite hotel is booked. The price of a triple just doesn't compete with other newer better hotels elsewhere around Tokyo. I will miss that convenient mall though.

<Content>vertigo Mad city! Got wobbly knees when looking out of 35th floor window. tiny room. Not very close to centre, ie Ginza, but if you can work out the metro then you can be there quite quickly. Very claustrophobic city after a month of Oz, but an interesting experience. 'Western' breakfast in basement, not bad...not a holiday hotel really, very much a business orientated atmosphere.

<Content>Is this a Holiday Inn? Normally we stay at the Metropolitan Hotel on the west exit side of Ikebukuro station but this time we were forced to find alternative lodgings due to a lack of availability due to the college entry testing on Saturday, many test-takers and their parents were staying in the hotel. Also, there were many visitors from China enjoying their New Year鈥檚 holiday. The only alternative we were able to find after searching more than ten hotels in the Tokyo area were double rooms at the Sunshine City Prince hotel at a corporate rate of 18,500 yen including a buffet breakfast.The hotel is clean and the room was well kept. It has a Holiday Inn type of feel: functional, with everything you might need, but definitely not fancy.. For the size of the room, the bed seemed a bit small. It felt smaller than the king size bed that I use at home. The room (2501) was on the corner and was extremely quiet. The view wasn鈥檛 great but you could see many of the taller building out towards Shinjuku. The fact that metal room keys are still used, made me think the hotel is old enough now for some renovations.The lobby is small, especially when considering the size of the hotel. There really isn鈥檛 anywhere to hang out. As the limousine buses coming from Narita and other tours drop off guests, the lobby definitely feels crowded. For dinner there are three restaurants in the basement and one on the lobby floor but we opted to walk out to the mall that is connected to the hotel. On the third floor of the mall are perhaps ten to fifteen restaurants to choose from. There鈥檚 everything from Chinese, pasta, curry, noodles, hamburgers, and omelets. The hotel itself is a ten minute walk from the Ikebukuro station or a three minute walk from the Higashi-Ikebukuro station on the Yurakucho subway line. Because of the distance from the station, there isn鈥檛 very much foot traffic around the hotel. This was evident in the mall as many of the stores were beginning to close at 8:00 pm and was very quiet by 8:30 pm when we finished dinner. For breakfast, there鈥檚 a large buffet in the lobby restaurant. If you don鈥檛 get there early enough though, you may be forced to wait to be seated. Also, be careful when you sit at the table, they are about two inches lower than normal. I bumped my knee on both mornings (luckily, I didn鈥檛 spill anything).Overall the service is efficient with a matter of fact attitude. When speaking in English though, the service can come off as a bit rough as some of the employees are not as well versed in the subtleties of the language and may forget to say please or thank you. There鈥檚 no free newspaper service so you have to buy one in the small gift shop in the lobby.If you have a choice, the Metropolitan on the west side is a nicer hotel for only a little bit more but the Sunshine Prince is not a bad second choice in the area.
