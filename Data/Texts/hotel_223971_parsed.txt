<Content>Best family hotel experience My husband and I stayed here for 5 days with our three children on a recent visit to Miami for a family reunion. We picked the Villas because my mother had a time share here and we wanted to stay near her. We got an amazing deal through my mother's time share. Paying such a low amount, $440 for the five nights, I wasn't expecting much. However, the suite was perfect. We had a master bedroom with a king-sized bed, a second bedroom with a queen bed and pull-out couch, and the living room had a large pull out couch as well. The pools were great, jacuzzi nice and hot and the kitchen in the suite was great for the family to eat breakfast in each day and a few meals we got take out and brought back to the room.The suite was perfectly clean, the staff at the desk and pool couldn't have been nicer, and a complimentary shuttle brought us to the Doral Spa accross the street where I enjoyed a yoga class, my husband and I both had great massages, and the kids loved the pool there with the giant slide.My only complaint was that the bath tub in the room was so large that it couldn't fill with hot water, and got luke warm part way through, so I couldn't enjoy a bath in the room. Otherwise the stay was perfect.You should know this is not near the beach, but that was fine for us as our family gatherings were near the hotel. It was an easy drive to the everglades where we took the kids on an airboat ride.  One of the best family trips we've ever taken, thanks to the Villas at Doral. Way to go!

<Content>Impressed with the Villas at Doral I'm writing this review whilst still at the Villas at Doral. We came down from Orlando a day early to escape poor weather and I'm so pleased we did. The villas are a good size and immaculately clean. We are a party of 4 (including two strapping 14 year olds) and we have plenty of room. The pool is inviting and the staff have been good when we've needed anything. We've been over to the Doral hotel and that if anything is more up-market. Nice to visit and then come back to our 'villa' though. This morning I had a massage at the spa (deep tissue - and effective) and my husband played the 'white' golf course (tougher than he expected!). Glad we're here three nights rather than two.

<Content>Mixed feelings We wanted to visite Miami and ended up in the Marriott's Villas at Doral. When you think Miami... you think Miami Beach. Well, it's not near this place. The Villas at Doral are across the street from the Marriott Doral hotel. It can be a busy street. But there is a complimentary shuttle bus from the Villas to the hotel. And because the pools are so much nicer at the hotel, you might want to go there.We have seen the concept before of Marriott Villas near a Marriott hotel, but not with a busy street inbetween. That was a bummer.The Villas at Doral have not that much to offer. The pool is small and to often the shade of the buildings take away the sun from the pool. For Miami Beach you are in the wrong place. This is more a inland resort. The rooms are nice, as usual with Marriott. For shopping it is located okay if you have a car. There are a few shopping malls not that far away (but neither that close!).The pools from the neighbouring hotel are worthwhile. We had a bad experience in the jacuzzi. They composition of the water ruined our bathing suits. We commented on this and the only respons we got was that they were going to notify the pool people. Whow! That helped my bathing suit a lot!All in all: we would not return: there are better options to go!

<Content>Excellent Stay We have just returned from a week at the Marriott Villas at Doral. The hotel was absolutely marvelous. We were given a two room apartment and it was large enough to accomodate 7 family members. The villa was in a fifth floor with a view of the Doral PGA golf course and near the pool, the sight was breathtaking. The building was adjacent to the pool, lobby, kids activity center and gym. We could also take a shuttle to the Doral club and use its pool, but my 4 and 10 year old daughters loved to stay in the activity center where there was a different daily activity for them, they enjoyed it a lot and when there was no activities the pool was incredible. Shopping around was not a problem, the International Mall and the Dolphin Mall are just five minutes driving. Sawgrass Mills is about 35 minutes away, there麓s a Publix and a Wall-Mart a mile away.I would say that this is one of my best stays in a timeshare villa, I would definitely recommend it and return many times

<Content>Marriott Villas @ Doral Just O.K. Seeing that I have stayed at several Marriott properties that were completely outstanding, makes me say that this resort is just o.k. I am so used to Marriott properties being really huge with several pools and beautiful landscaping. The rooms themselves were decent. Our room (Building 6000) was updated and everything seemed pretty new. My only problem with being on the top floor corner unit (something I always request) is at this resort, the balcony on the top floor has no covering. So when it rains (and it did quite often), you cannot sit out on the balcony. The carpeting next to the balcony entrance would always get soaked. I never could understand that concept of not having the top balcony covered. Other than that, the resort is beautiful. Pool was small compared to other Marriott Resorts, but nice. The staff was friendly and accomodating. They have scheduled activities and tours daily. Never ate at the resort, we alway ate out so I am not sure about the food. Again, overall the stay was nice.

<Content>loved it Our stay in May was really nice. I had a rental car and found the place easily. I was coming from FLL airport. The two bedrooms are a really nice size with a full kitchen and indoor and out door eating area. I am going to take a leap here but I believe all the rooms have a glorious view of the lake and golf course. The rooms were clean and everything worked fine. There was a huge soaking tub and a large standing shower in the master. And one more combination shower/bath for the other room. The washer and dryer in the room also came in handy. It has a small but nice gym with a little game room on the side, played a little pool on the boring day. Staff was really nice and had printed directions to everyplace that I wanted to go. I would defiantly say you need a car to get around. Not to say everything is far, more like around the corner and up the road a mile and a half. The are many restaurants in the area and fast food and supermarket in the area. It's a great place for families but I would stay here also if I was trying to get away from my family, LOL... I would defiantly keep this place in mind when I come back to Florida. Oh this was a family trip of 5 adults and 1 toddler. We utilized both beds in the rooms plus the pull out in the living room. There were no complaints from the couple sleeping on the pull out. I think there was one other pull out in the other bed room also. The two bedroom suite could hold 7 comfortable, 8 might be a squeeze.

<Content>Old, Unclean, Ridiculous Costs. We stayed at the Doral for 4 nights and were extremely disappointed in almost all aspects of our stay. On a positive note, the staff was friendly. However, our room was really dirty! The drink prices- alcohol and non-alcohol- were outrageous, even for a resort. With tip, well over $15 for a basic mixed drink and about $3.50 for just a can of soft drink. The food was mediocre, at best, with high prices consistent with those of the beverages. The pool was lovely, but getting pool towels was difficult- they were old, small, rationed and you had to pay $5.00 per towl if they were lost. To use a pool flotation noodle, you had to rent it for $6.00 per day! If you want solely a golf experience, this might be your place. But, for anything beyond just playing golf, I recommend staying elsewhere.

<Content>Suites only have TWO bedrooms Stayed here for one night before leaving Miami on a cruise. There were six of us adults and one baby traveling. I booked the villa suite being under the impression it had 3 bedrooms (One king, One queen, One double). Front desk said at check-in that it was a misprint on Expedia's part, since their largest suite only has 2 bedroom units with a pull out sofa in the living room...that was a surprise to us. Outside of the fact that one couple had to sleep in the living room the first night of the holiday we all thought it was a nice clean place. Beds were real comfortable. Kitchen has everything you need. We loved the fact there is a washer/dryer in the suite. We had a big terrace with lots of seating right in front of the pool/jacuzzi (which is huge)...we were on the main floor. The pool was gorgeous and warm. I have been to Miami several times now and know my way around. South beach is where the best hotels are but if you want a quiet hotel away from the action this is a nice place to go.... with kids especially.

<Content>Great Stay at Marriott's Villas at Doral We had a one week stay at Marriott's Villas at Doral (April 2008) and couldn't have been more pleased. This is a smaller Marriott resort (only 98 villas), and all villas are 2 bedroom, 2 bath. Two of the buildings over look the pool (and were refurbished during the summer of 2007), the rest of the buildings over look the lake. This resort is maintained very nicely, and the staff couldn't have been more pleasant. The resort has activities designed for children as well as adults (we took a walking tour of the Doral Resort  Spa) across the street from the villas (3 golf courses, beautiful spa, pools  restaurants); that villa guests are welcome to use. The villas fitness center (on the second floor) is very nice (a portion of it over looks the pool and lake), and most of the equipment is new within the past few months. There is also a game room next to the fitness center. This resort is very close to the Miami airport (15 minutes) as well as major freeways. Plenty of retail and restaurants within a 5 minute drive, and lots of sights and things to do. We had no problem finding our way to a baseball game at Dolphins Stadium, South Beach, Sharks Valley State Park, and Singer Island (1 1/2 hour drive). I would highly recommend this resort, and look forward to a return visit.

<Content>Loved the bed This hotel is really nice. We stayed a few nights after we took a cruise out of miami. It was really relaxing. I loved the bed, it was just so comfortable. The first night we didn't do much we just ordered room service. The highlight was that they had Ben and Jerry Pints. Very yummy. The next day we took a cab over to the Dolphin Mall. That place is so huge, We saw a movie, went to lunch and shopped until we dropped.One of the things I noticed about this hotel was that everytime you passed a member of the hotel's staff they always said hi to us. That doesn't always happen when you stay places. If you have the money you should book a room.

<Content>Miami Area Visit 3/28 - 4/4/08 As Marriott Vacation Club Owners we exchanged our week at our home resort to stay in Miami so my daughter could visit a couple of colleges and we could visit the area.The Villas at Doral are very nice. It was not a very busy week there, so it was quiet and peaceful.At check-in our room was not quite ready (housekeeping shortage) and we left our cell number and waited in the lounge. Within 10 minutes our room was ready and we were on our way.We had a 2bed/2bath villa (room 7201) and it was very spacious. There were a few minor things - there was a stain on the carpet and the living room sofa was in need of replacement (it wasn't very comfortable) - but overall it was a great stay. Our bed was comfortable, we always had hot water and all the appliances were in great working order. Our room overlooked the golf course and was the furthest building from the Pool, but that was ok by us. There are lounge chairs not just at the pool, but all along the pond and several places to sit outside to picnic or whatever. We even used the gas grills for lunch one day. You do need to ask someone to help you light them, but once we understood that - all was great.The staff was very courteous and helpful. We asked for towel service and it arrived in 15 minutes and then the front desk called to follow up. We checked out the gym and game room and attended a couple of the activites. Ice Cream Sundaes were good and our daughter played Wii a couple of times.Overall - the villas are comfortable and enjoyable. The Doral Resort and Spa is across the street and they will transport you over there if you book a golf game or have a spa visit.One thing to note is there is a great deal of airport traffic (flights coming in for landings), but we did not find it distracting and my son was fascinated with watching them so close.The area is busy - not like downtown Miami, but there were plenty of places to eat, etc... We really liked Pizza which was just up the road in the Publix plaza. We also went to Panera in that plaza and stocked up our fridge at the Publix.The rest of the trip was great too. We went to South Beach and enjoyed Lincoln Road Markets. The best meal we had all trip was here at the Books  Books Cafe. The service was EXCELLENT and the food was even better. There were lots of other choices but this fit us best.

<Content>Nothing to write home about!! I go to the Doral area quite often to do my shopping and I have been around several hotels. This is by far the worst experience of all. My husband is a Marriot's fanatic so when we travel with him we need to stay at a Marriot.The location is excellent, finding it if you are not familiar with the area or at night will prove an odissey.The check in counter is pretty much non-existant and it would be helpful to be explained of how this hotel works at check-in.I was with my husband and my 4 year old. Lots of walking, very little parking and the rooms are in very poor condition. Doesnt feel like a Marriot at all, more like a motel. Don't expect the full clean up of a hotel, you will get clean towels and a very rude maid will come once a day at a fixed time and if you are not out of the room, Too bad!!! All in all i dont recommend it, stay in there only if you dont have a choice.

<Content>Beware! Perfect for the Disabled Consumer. Use caution when checking into this establishment or you will end up like we did, on the first floor in a special needs rooms with a blackspider greeting you in the morning. The personnel at the front desk were quick to get me on my way and failed to advise me that they had given us a special needs room. WhenI called to request a change, I was told that all the rooms were like this. Needless to say, the closets are all split in two, so if you have a gown or long dress, do not plan on hanging it in any of the closets in this villa. The master bath shower has a steel medical seatin the walk in shower. All the fixtures and furniture, including tables and chairs are low and appropriately porportioned for wheel chair access. Not comfortable for anyone over five feet two.The hotel site also fails to mention that there are truly only 2 beds,a king in the master and a queen in the 2nd bedroom. The 2nd bedroom also has a sofa bed in it that if it was opened for usage would block the access to the bedroom's door and closet. Not practical at all. The 2nd bath is actually roomy and comfortable. There is a 2nd sofabedwith a flimsy mattress in the living room.Because we were in 5101, 1st floor, the living room leads to an exterior patio that is not secured from the outside area in any way, so anyone can sit and walk through the exterior area. Security is meekin an area that is heavily populated and with a metro airport, miami international, as a neighbor to offer the background noise. The 3 barbeques and pool area were literally within 25 feet of the patio off our living room. So if it had been a longer stay, I am sure we would have had to endure others cooking and socializing right by our livingroom doors at all hours of the night.At 8:15 am, we were awoken by the foul language of property employees who were turning on the water hose, that appeared to be directly underour bedroom windows. Once the faucets was turned on, the water sound was enough to wake up the dead. So between the language of the staff and the water turmoil from our bedroom window, we were rudely awoken and upset. Not exactly a good experience.The room in itself was nice and roomy, with the exception of it being designed for someone with disabilities. If ALL the villa suites are like this, then perhaps the units need to be identified appropriately before we rent them. The parking was plentiful, and the location was convenient. The staff is inept and uncaring. With all the options in the area, look for something else, especially if traveling for a shortvisit.

<Content>Spacious, pleasant, great experience. My family and I (group of 7 adults) took two 2-bedroom villas. Helpful check in people managed to put us next door to each other (although the hotel was almost fully booked).Apartments are beautifully furnished, spacious, fully equipped kitchen and the suite has a very large bathroom with a huge bath.Location is great, next to the airport and freeways. Beautiful complex, large swimming pool. Breakfast across the street at the Doral (included on the package) is wonderful. Package also included one round of golf (no hassle booking the previous night for an early morning game).Since we were travelling to the Caribbean and would only be back a week later, they were more than nice to store our luggage (all 14 large pieces of it!).In short, I would highly recommend for families travelling to Miami.

<Content>Good Place to stay. We stayed here for a week over the July 4th holiday. We own a timeshare in the Marriott system so we stayed cheap. When I booked, I could have paid the same price at the Doral across the street with kids eat free. We made the right choice for the extra room, and after seeing how bad the Doral Hotel's room are. The pool at the Villas is nice, and we went across the Doral's Pool twice because the kids liked the big slide there. The room was completely renovated and is just a little smaller than other Marriott Timeshares. Would suggest to anyone who has a family.

<Content>Weekend at the Villas While Seeing the Patriots Crush the Dolphins We stayed two nights in a two bed/two bath villa at Marriott's Villas at Doral. We booked this reservation back in the early spring while planning a trip to see the ball game. The price was $189.00/night which inluded one round of golf. Since green fees are $145.00, it was a bargain. When we arrived we learned the pool was closed for resurfacing which was a bummer for my wife who was not going to the game on Sunday with us guys. She was allowed to use the pool across the street at the hotel at the golf club. There was a free shuttle or she could was the 100 yards.We actually got two free golf passes at check in which saved us another $145.00 and we got $10 off the quoted rate ($179.00). So we made out real well on the weekend as far as the cost of the room.The villa was very large, clean, and had a well equipped kitchen. The master bath had a large shower and a huge tub. The water was plentiful and hot and the a/c worked great.The staff was curtious and helpful. There was no attempt to sell us a timer share. They printed our return boarding passes and arranged for a shuttle for my wife to take to the airport on Sunday. They extended her checkout time to 2pm. which was very helpful.The only negative for the weekend was that we went to the resort across the street for breakfast on saturday and had them valet park our car for 45 minutes. They charged us $11.00 to valet the car which we wouldn't have done had we known the cost. We didn't complain in light of the free round of golf we got.The golf was great and the game even better.

<Content>Beautiful Complex - But Spread Out I had the opportunity to stay at the Marriott Complex down in Doral where the famous Blue Monster Golf Course is. The area is beautiful.Parking was a major hassle. If you valet it is done at the main lodge which is a couple of minutes from the outermost buildings. If you self-park it is a few more minutes of a walk, which is the Florida heat isn't too great.When you check in, take advantage of a bellman to take you to your room. My colleague and I attempted to find our building and it took 15 minutes in the dark because it was not easily accessible or clearly marked.The rooms were great and most opened out into a courtyard. Good beds and it was quite clean. Strangely you had to turn the AC down very low to get a workable temperature - not sure why. However, mine sat on 60 for most of the week.Area is beautiful and well landscaped. The hotel was easy to find and only about 10-12 minutes from the MIA. Just down the road is a McDonalds and Burger King for breakfast. And a little farther west is a Starbucks. The main building of the hotel has a coffee shop, but not as good as Starbucks.The exercise room is fairly big and nice. It is kind of hidden but once you go there once it is easy to find.I'd love to return to the hotel and golf, but I have a feeling the regular rate would be quite costly.

<Content>Spacious accomodations Stayed at this Marriott vacation property with a friend on a long weekend trip down to Miami to visit the Chihuly exhibit at the Fairchild Botanical Gardens. We wanted 2 beds, ideally a suite, because one of us stays up late and one gets up early. The 2-bedroom villa was perfect for our needs. The villa is big enough for a family. It was clean, new-looking, comfortable. The soaking tub was huge - not jetted, and the bathroom in the larger bedroom is open to the room (the shower and toilet are in a separate space with a door.) As a villa, on-site dining isn't available, but there is a shuttle to the Marriott Doral Resort across the street; we didn't go there.Check-in was smooth, friendly. We stayed only one night, and didn't go to the pool or any other facilities. Standing by the front door, you could hear the traffic on the street, but it wasn't noticable in the front bedroom. We never heard a neighbor.Would recommend this property for families or friends traveling together - it's a lot of space for the price.

<Content>Great Service in a Tired Resort I was at the Doral for a business conference at the end of February. As others have said, it is a tired resort with worn, dated carpting and fixtures. The main lobby is nice, if dated, whereas each of the seperate units (similar to apartment buildings around a main clubhouse) have tiny elevators and sparse lobbies. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and very well maintained. I didn't play golf, use the spa, or swim in the pool (although all three looked to be 1000 times more inviting than the conference!)All of that being said, I don't think I have ever seen such friendly and attentive service from everyone at the resort. People everywhere asked me how my stay was going, if there was anything I needed, where I was from, etc and actually seemed to care what my answer was. The resort really is far away from anything worth leaving the resort for (the only restaurants off of the resort were chain restaurants along a busy Miami street).In summary, if you are going to golf, the spa, or to hang out at a pool and want to be surrounded by friendly, attentive staff, this is a great spot. If you want to feel as surrounded by luxury and 4-Star quality, the Doral will probably not live up to your expectations.

<Content>Great stay! We stayed for one night after our cruise. We rented a car and drove to the resort. Check in was friendly and efficient. We were given a corner villa in building 6 on the 4th floor. The villa was clean and spacious. The kitchen was very well equipped for a long stay. We used the shuttle to go over to the pools at the Doral Resort. The zero entry pool is not heated, so we moved on to the other pool. It was nice and warm and not many people were using it. The water slide was really fun and heated. They also have a small kiddie pool that was heated. We would definitely stay here again. It was great!

<Content>Great for a few days The villa at Doral was great for our family - 3 boys 9,11 and 13 while my husband was on business in Miami. The accomodation was spacious and well equipped, the pool was great for the kids and the staff very friendly and helpful. The boys had two golf lessons at the Jim Mclean golf school at Doral at $208 a go, but to play golf, on the cheapest of the five courses for 4 (plus dad) including clubs and a buggie would have been over $1000. We didn't! Not a lot to do near Doral other than golf and shopping and quite a way from the beach.We went on from here to Hawks Cay on Duck Key, Florida Keys which was awesome in comparison probably because it was a real holiday resort, but if you have to be in Miami, the villas at Doral is cool.

<Content>Very nice hotel and great for the kids We just returned from Miami with a 5 and 7 year old and had a blast. The Villas are very nice and clean. Upon check in we were offered a number of choices in rooms. The #6 and #7 are the newer buildings and we stayed in the #6 on the 3rd floor. I would suggest higher floors as even the folks at registration told us that they are the nicer rooms as they have better views of the lake and golf course. The #4 building is the original building so the folks at registration said it is showing it's wear. I would also suggest taking advantage of all of the activities over at the Doral Resort across the street. The Villas have a comp shuttle which we used most of the time however, we walked over once and it's very close. There are two very large pools as well as a very large slide called the Blue Monster at the Resort. We couldn't keep both kids off it once they tried it. Another benefit to the Resort is that you can order food right at the pool. We had lunch there one day which was nice. We believe staying at the Villas provides you with the best of both worlds, an amazing place to stay (2 bedroom/2 bath Condo with Kitchen) and all of the luxuries of a world class resort right across the street. Hope this helps you on your future trips to the Villas.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed here on a women's only trip. It was beautiful and peaceful. The facilities were well kept and the staff was helpful. The pool area was nothing to drag about, but the guests at the Villas are allowed access to the facilities at the Resort and Spa across the street. We didn't get a chance to use it, but from the street the resot looked wonderful. The room was big enough for six of us to comfortably stay without trouble. The two bathroom, two bedroom suite with a full kitchen was perfect. Location is kind of out of the way, but the amenities are worth it.

<Content>Extremely pleased! I visited Miami for a wedding and the Marriott's Villas at Doral was more than I expected. The staff was extremely friendly and overly helpful. They were forthcoming with directions and even had airport directions already printed at the front desk. The villa was GREAT!! it was very spacious and clean. I was extremely pleased with both bedrooms. The 2nd bedroom was just as nice as the master bedroom (I even thought the 2nd bedroom was the master). The villa was a home away from home! The location is also great! You are conveniently located to every major freeway and you can get to South Beach in about 20 minutes (I was in Miami for 5 days and went 5 times). Anything you need is right around the hotel--shopping, restuarants, coffee shop, drug store, etc. You also have privileges at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa which is directly across the street. I would definitely stay at Marriott's Villas at Doral in the future.

<Content>Perfect location This is one of our best experiences at Timeshare resorts.Very good location, fast drive to best malls of Miami.Couple of minutes from the airport.The rooms are also very nice. Only that the second bedroom only has one bed. You have a great view of the golf course located at the resort.Everything is nearby. Publix, Walmart, Bestbuy, BJ are all less then 15 minutes away. Even Tigerdirect is close.

<Content>Not a bad place to visit just spent a week at this resort on timeshare exchange, resort is quiet  clean with well equiped two bedroom units that have nice views of the Doral white course, staff is helpful  there are 5-6 planned activities every day, in addition there is usage of some of the facilities at the doral resort across street 15-20 minute drive to downtown Miami  beaches would not stay here without a car, bar/restaurant at pool seemed overpriced didn't try food if you don't mind being in the flight pattern of nearby Miami International Airport not a bad place to stay

<Content>Ideal for families Stayed in a 2-bed with my family for a week. The apartment was very spacious, clean, comfortable, and had a nice balcony over looking the lake. We loved the 3-TVs and well equipped kitchen (blender etc). You can fill the dishwasher without running out of plates and glasses. Pool area is very good. Only a 5-minute drive to a medical centre and Publix supermarket. Good base to explore Miami and beaches. We recommend visiting Parrot Jungle Island if you have children. We attended the timeshare presentation which took about 2-hours and included a visit to the main Doral resort across the road. Not too much pressure to buy. We would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great hotel My family  I stayed at the Marriott Villas March 27-29, 2005. We loved this hotel and would highly recommend it. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and check in was very speedy. The accommodations were nice  clean with 2 separate bedrooms, pullout sleeper sofa, big tub w/separate shower in master bedroom, additional bathroom connected to second bedroom, 3 TVS, DVD player, full kitchen and washer  dryer. (We used that dryer everytime we came back from the pool.) Our balcony overlooked the beautiful lake and golf course. Since my family (with 3 boys ages 11, 7,  4) spent most of our time at the pool, I didn't get to see much of their facilities. My sons did enjoy their time in the game room by the pool. The pool had a basketbell net in it which my 11yr loved. We also took the shuttle over to the Doral Resort's pool, which has a great slide. My only complaint is we had over a 15 minute wait for the shuttle going back to the Villas. If my sons had worn their shoes over, we would have walked the short walk back. There are also gas grills for guest use, which we took advantage of. (Publix grocery store is conveniently close.) Also, they have a time-share tour you can take that will give you $100 credit to spend at the hotel. We couldn't take it because it was already sold out, but will next time we are there. This place wonderful and we can't wait to go back.
