<Content>Good base hotel Probably a hotel used more often by business travelers than tourists. Very helpful staff, simple yet comfortable rooms and good location. We booked the hotel with points and were concerned about the location. There is a metro stop just one block away from the hotel, its surrounded by shopping and restaurant opportunities.

<Content>A workhorse hotel Last stayed at this hotel in 2002 and it appears as if nothing has changed. I mean nothing. It is a typical well worn business hotel that is used by business people and tourists alike. It is now starting to look a bit old and worn.The rooms are quite small with basic Ikea style furniture and fittings. Everything worked ok and it was clean (not spotless). The bath had a curtain that didn't quite fit, so the carpet into the bedroom and the door frame were starting to rot away. Nothing serious but why has nobody from maintenance noticed?Stayed for 4 nights and one day the room wasn't cleaned. Not a big deal, but had to wait a further hour before someone from housekeeping came.Breakfasts were very good. Hot and cold to suit most tastes. Staff throughout the hotel were very good, polite, attentive, although I did come across a couple of waiters in the bar area that spoke NO English. Very unusual in a European business hotel, but it was fun to point and smile to ask for what you wanted.Location is good from airport. 20 mins and 20 Euros by taxi. Metro is right down the road and is very cheap. 5.50 Euro for a one day all you can eat ticket. You can walk to the Ramblas tourist area in about 30 mins, but it is worth getting the metro back. Watch out for pickpockets.....they are everywhere in Barcelona. No problem in the hotel though with security.

<Content>Great location for tourists  The Hilton Barcelona in the heart of the financial  high-endshopping district is a great place to stay for both biz  vacationpurposes. The tram stop is 50 meters away  the Metro (subway station) is 100 meters away. Staff all speak excellentEnglish, are very accomodating  respond favorably to upgraderequests if the rooms are available. Many Airline Crews stay here  the morning brunch is incredible (more extensive than what's offered at many Ritz Carltons). Inquire about their Packages, they're definitely the deal of the trip. Easy access to la Ramblas  only 20 minutes to the airport (20 Euros + luggage charge). I'll definitely stay here on my next trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Great Hotel and friendly staff Stayed at this purposely because it is away from the city centre. Don't get me wrong, I love the city centre, but the hotel is far enough out to get you into an area of Barcelona called 'Corts'. The area is remarkably tourist free with great shopping on your door step. Placa Catalunyia is a brisk 25 minute walk away but you can be at the tourist bus stop (A definite must do!!) on Pl. de Francesc Macia in 10 minutes. Your nearest metro is 5 mins away it runs direct to Dressanes at the bottom of las Ramblas and takes 10 minutes.The hotel itself is your typical Hilton 5*. Modern rooms, air conditioning, TV etc. There has been criticism on room size. To be fair the rooms aren't the biggest I've stayed in but are more than adequate. We stayed on the executive floor and found the room sizes to be a standard size across all classes. The room was clean and the bathroom spotless. We found the staff to be very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We stayed on the executive floor on a BB basis. If you stay on the executive floor continental breakfast is included provided you eat it the executive lounge (see comments below about Americans!). Our room rate included full breakfast in the main dinging room - far superior to what was offered upstairs!!The executive floor has its perks such as afternoon coffee and cake. About four thirty they open up the alcohol. Free pour spirits, selection of wines, beer and soft drinks. There are hot and cold nibbles also. One thing to be aware of is drunk Americans!! Ww've normally found Americans (we are British btw) to be quite anal over the volume of alcohol that other people drink. Not so when it's free!! Don't be surprised to see Americans knocking back the liquor and grazing off the buffet for most of the night. That is until they pass out through drink or go into a food coma from the sheer volume of food they have consumed leaving little for anybody else - well that is until the buffet is replenished and they descend on it like a plague of locusts. Enjoy we did.

<Content>disappointed loyal hilton member 1. Room maintenance defective-we have photos2. Room cleaning done after protest at 14.20 hours3. So-called gold priviledges have been changed one month ago with forewarning...4. Net price preposterous in the current market and competition...This is a sure way to lose brand clientele--and to fill the hotel with airline crews--the only visible other clients

<Content>Average Hilton with above average staff We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights (1 before and 1 after our cruise from Barcelona). As Hilton Diamond members we were upgraded to an executive room which was clean and modern.The executive lounge was good and the staff were incredibly helpful - nothing was too much trouble. We were checked in by a girl called Patricia who was exceptional, her English was excellent and she was extremely helpful. All the staff seemed good but she certainly stood out.We had booked 3 rooms as we were travelling with family but used points for one room. As identified by other reviewers this was an expensive hotel and certainly was amongst the most expensive Hilton hotels. Based on location and facilities I would say it was costly. This is probably a good business hotel and is accessible via good transport links to centre of Barcelona. Overall it is an average Hilton in terms of standard and value for money with well above average staff.

<Content>I love Barcelona Stayed for a few days during a euro vacation--had a GREAT experience. Staff was extremely helpful, executive lounge had great food, and loved the location--very close to shopping and subway. Property isn't quite as modern as other Hiltons in Europe, but it wasn't dated and was very clean.

<Content>Good location, helpful staff My husband stayed at this hotel for a business trip, and our infant daughter and I joined him halfway through the week. We were given a very nice crib and infant bathtub to use for our daughter. We stayed on the executive floor, which had a staffed desk and a lounge with complimentary food and drinks throughout most of the day. The breakfast was excellent, there were sweets in the afternoon and savory treats in the evening. Water, soda, wine, and spirits were frequently available; and it was a relaxing environment. The staff at that desk and at the main front desk of the hotel were all incredibly helpful and friendly. Everyone spoke excellent English, which helped us a lot.I had a broken leg, so was using a wheeled thing to get around. It was very easy, with the entrance on ground level and no stairs, and elevators to access all floors. Definitely an accessible place.The location was very good. The Diagonal tram stopped in front of the hotel, and a few of buses stopped nearby and ran to Pla莽a de Catalunya, so it was easy to travel. The FC Barcelona stadium and museum and the university are only a short tram ride and walk away. The hotel charges a lot for wi-fi, but there is a copy shop/internet place a few blocks down Diagnonal that offers computers and internet for 2.95 Euros per half hour.Would stay there again if we could afford it. Perfect for business travel!

<Content>Exceptional service, very friendly Stayed in this hotel 10 days on a business trip so got to know the place really quite well. The hotel is located about 10/15 minutes by taxi from the city centre and the Ramblas - the main street off which there are numerous side streets and alleys to explore in the Gothic part of Barcelona. The metro and buses are also located fairly close to the hotel. A few hundred yards along the main road is El Corte Ingles - department store open until about 22.00 selling everything from food to furniture, as well as several really quite good restaurants - try La Bo Tiga, excellent tapas served in a chic environment or my favourite (because it's authentic traditional Spanish) the restaurant L'Antull tucked away in a back street just behind the hotel (go down the ramp, turn right, immediately left down narrow alley, then right after 100 yards and you will see it on the corner) - doesn't look like much, basic decor, great fish, and if you get on with the waiter, as much agua diente you can handle! Don't bother with restaurant Si Senor right by the hotel - more like No Senor, bad food, service etc.Hotel rooms however are not great - clean certainly, but lacking charm, and not great prices either. However, on the 4th floor there is the executive lounge which serves free food and drink all day (no one seems to bother checking if you have an exec room!).Public areas are modern and reasonably comfortable with good bar service. Meeting rooms are very good but pricey - get your own lunch sent in or go out.Service at this hotel is excellent, any problems quickly resolved; all staff are cheerful and friendly. I would give the hotel 5 stars overal if it were not for the rooms as mentioned already.

<Content>Hilton Prices minus the Hilton Quality If you need to stay in the downtown area, great location. Short walk to shopping center and university.Staff is very friendly and helpful, however, for 225.00 Euro, I say it is not worth the price. The bed was the only thing that was not run down. Rooms are small and unimpressive (It actually reminded me of a dorm I lived in while in the military).I stayed in other cities in Spain at nicer resort hotels for 1/2 the price with more to offer.

<Content>Fantastic - cant wait to return! We stayed at the Hilton for 5 nights and loved it! A beautiful hotel, it is only short bus journey to the harbour and The Ramblas the hotel had very helpful, friendly staff. We stayed in a suite and got to use the Executive Lounge, which was fabulous! We went to see a match at Nou Camp, which is a 10-minute walk from here, also the city bus tours stop next to the hotel, as do the regular buses. Try and eat at one of the fish restaurants by the harbour! The only tiny aspect missing would be a pool but we were out so much that we would have struggled to use it. We can鈥檛 wait to go back, we adored Barcelona and loved this hotel!

<Content>Great time! Just returned from an excellent stay in the Hilton Barcelona! Went to watch the football so hotel is an ideal place as the Nou Camp is only 10mins walk around the corner. The hotel has a few restaurants close by and it is on Avenue Diagonal which has loads of high class shops. The Hilton is a 10 euros taxi ride from La Ramblas so is not too far from the main centre of town.The hotel itself was excellent, all the staff spoke good English and they could not have been more helpful. We had breakfast each morning and there was plenty of choice and the standard of food was excellent. The bar was excellent as well, especially the friendly bar man Phillipe who spent a great deal of time talking about football and Barcelona with us.Very impressed with the hotel and when we return to Barcelona (which will be soon as we loved it!) we will come back here.

<Content>Not worth it! This Hilton is not worth its rating or high rates. Thankfully we stayed here only 2 nights for my wife's business meeting, so it cost us nothing. Our first floor room was at the back of the hotel overlooking the nicely manicured park with palm trees, so it was quiet, but I would imagine the rooms up front on Av. Diagonal would be rather noisy. The decor of the lobby seemed mismatched and cheap. The decor in the room was downright budget. It reminded me of a modern youth hostel and had a very institutional feel. The carpet in the room had an odd texture and was not very clean. There was not quite enough storage in the room, and the lighting was a bit poor. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was very nice, aside from the ugly brown marble tiles. The location of the hotel was convenient to a metro station and shopping mall, but little more. The breakfast was decent, but the coffee of rather poor quality. The staff was very accommodating and helpful and spoke great English. One staff member in particular, a gentleman named Yves, was extremely polite and helpful. The staff indicated to me that this is a well run hotel, but one that is in dire need of a remodel, a price adjustment, or both. Do yourself a favor and do not stay here if travelling to Barcelona as there are many nicer hotels in better locations with lower rates.

<Content>not worth five stars I spent two nights at this rather unimpressive Hilton. The location is not near the interesting tourist areas nor any of several international conference centers, but does have a convenient Metro nearby. The staff was uniformly nice, helpful and able to communicate in English-this was really the best feature of the hotel. The lobby was very nice, but elevators small and not always working. The room was small but ok size for European standards, but in need of renovation, or at least painting. No iron or other useful amenities in room, very expensive internet access (23 Euro daily for mediocre connection). The bathroom was clean and everything worked well. The bed wasn't bad, but not one of the best, although several nice pillows helped. No pool and tiny ill-equipped gym. The breakfast was included in my package but was more appropriate for a 2-3 star hotel-bad weak coffee and limited, below average quality buffet. Pricy, uninteresting lunch and dinner menus, which I didn't try, but meals at meeting not high quality. Overall, not so bad for the brief meeting I attended, but I would choose somewhere else.

<Content>Yuk! Dried poop on the brown marble floor and it had been there for a while. Because of the lines in the marble it was hard to detect . I was shocked to find out that it had hardened and blended into the floor. Housekeeping was alerted and we were moved into another room, but only after I insisted.Boring  outdated lobby and rooms. Windows would not open.Worse Hilton I have ever stayed in, they should remove it from the chain. Watch the floors!

<Content>weak location, very dated and dreary This hotel looks drab and dreary, with a lot of gray carpet and walls (but in a battleship way, instead of a cool, hip W hotels way) and the service is not very good. Additionally, if you are here on vacation, why stay so far away from any of the sights? You could do much better by staying on the Paseeig de Gracia (a very nice neighborhood...close, yet far away from the touristy Las Ramblas).metro is close, but to get to the major places, it may involve longer rides and/or transfers. Not much of a service attitude here (they don't even have a concierge!) Only come here if you have points or are super loyal to Hilton (i loved the hotel prestige, which may even be cheaper and is much, much nicer)

<Content>Great location and service. Decor needs some touching up It's rare that you can be in an urban setting and see palm trees swaying from your hotel window. The Barcelona Hilton pulls it off with a great location on the tree-lined Avinguda Diagonal. It's walking distance to restaurants, a shopping center, and a Metro station. The staff is multi-lingual and friendly, I heard them assisting guests in English, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and French. The rooms are comfortable if cold and sterile. They were redone in a modern IKEA-type style with silver metallic fictures and really lack any type of warmth or personality. However the beds were comfortable, the air conditioning was blowing cool air, and there was a good variety of TV channels. The lobby also is looking a bit dated, it definitely does not match the decor of the rooms and has an awkward combination of low ceilings and a slightly tired atrium. But overall the great location,comfortable rooms, and good service make the Hilton a fairly good choice for a Barcelona stay.

No pool, no sauna, no anything.Not very likely to return.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Good Location Stayed there due to a conference nearby. The hotel is on Avenue Diagonal, a few blocks to the subway, close to a shoping mall that looks like an office building, (because it is combined). Not a huge convention-type Hilton. Rooms were very clean, modern/sparely furnished but adequate. Speakers for tv in bathroom were a nice touch. If you like long walks it's easy to get to La Ramblas, Plaza de Catalunya, Calle Gracia, and the wonderful Gaudi buildings. May not be the greatest price, didn't compare because was there for business. Always felt safe.

<Content>Fantastic I went to Barcelona with my mom stepdad and sister and a few friends 2 summers ago and I loved this hotel. I tend to be very picky about where I sleep especially when it comes to hotels and I still to this day believe that I have never slept better in a hotel. I had a room on the executive floor that I shared with my sister. The room was beautiful, very modern with a nice sized dark marble bathroom. I read a previous review from a traveller staying on the executive floor and was shocked.. I find it surprising that they found anything negative about these rooms. The temperature was also wonderful for me as well. The rooms very smoking rooms I believe, and I am not a smoker but there was not even a lingering stench of ciggerette in there. The area was nice, more in the financial district then the main las ramblas area but a short cab ride away. They have a huge delish breakfast buffet but the price is steep at 20 Euros a person.. I loved this modern beautiful hotel. Would recommend this hotel to anyone!!

And the staff was extremely curious.If you get a chance try to get access to the concerige lounge, it offers excellent views and constant free beverages and snacks.A little out of the way, but the taxi's and metro service are very easy and inexpensive to get around town.If you buy food or beverages to consume in your room, buy them at the grocery store in the mall across the street (much cheaper than else where).Bart

<Content>Great Hotel with Great Location I arrived at 10.00am and had a complimentary early check-in. Stayed in a Deluxe Room. The room is simple, comfortable bed and clean. The taxi fares from the Airport to the Hotel is around 鈧?0. Breakfast cost 鈧?2. Had a full selection of cheese, yogurts, pastries, good selection of hot items and fruits. Good service. You can get cheaper for your meals outside of the hotel. At the nearby restaurants. There is Si Senor (Mexican Restaurant), Starbucks next to Si Senor and shopping centres, El Corte Ingles within walking distance (5 minutes). The staff of the hotel was helpful and friendly. The location was great and located at Av. Diagonal! 7 minutes walk to the train station (M). Shopping centres and shops within walking distance. Turn left to El Corte Ingles (Big departmental store) and right to other shops. It is not in the city centre, 15 minutes to La Ramblas by car. Shops close at 8pm. Good value for money and Yes! I will definitely come back to this hotel with my family!

<Content>Mostly great, some gotchas My husband and I booked into the Hilton the night before leaving Spain thinking it would provide the services we would need. Driving into town, it was difficult for us to figure out how to get to the hotel, as the entrance is not straight on Avda Diagonal.The staff was very helpful and friendly. Room service was prompt, the food was of reasonable quality. As noted in other reviews, the rooms are sylishly modern but a little difficult to use, as much of the furniture is low to the ground and the tables are small. Internet access at 27 euros per day is quite overpriced. We had also stayed at Hotel Jazz, which provided the same services, a friendly staff, modern but functional and comfortable decor, and free internet access, for less per night. I would stay at Hotel Jazz when in Barcelona again and skip the Hilton.

<Content>A Great Place to Stay We only stayed for three nights but it was magnificant. The staff were friendly and very helpful. They could not do enough! The breakfast has the biggest choice we have ever seen. There was nothing missing that we could see and if there was I am sure it would have been provided. Available from 7am to 11am every day is also very good. No rushing down before it closes.Bedroom was good. Bed very comfortable. Excellent power shower. Loads of TV channels and some Radio stations. Quite a lot of in-house movies though we didn't bother with them. Only short corridors from lifts makes a real pleasant change. No long treks to room - fantastic. The lifts are amazing. They are so silent. You press the button and it arrives before you know it. Silently!! The design and decor is very modern. We loved it. Nowhere seems to mention this but the Metro station is Maria Christina about 300 metres away. From the airport take R1 train to Sants Estacio (2.60 Euros) and change to L3 to Maria Christina (1.20 Euros). Total 3.80 Euros. Much cheaper than a taxi and dead easy. Get a ten trip Metro ticket for 6.85 Euros - excellent value. We didn't use them but there are loads of buses right outside the hotel as is the tram. Taxis are everywhere. Coming out of the Metro station turn right towards the Hilton. You cross over a very busy underpass and a busy junction. There on the corner is El Corte Ingles - a fantastic department store. Everything you will ever need is there. In the basement is a large supermarket - again with everything. Excellent prices too. On a par with the larger Carrefour supermarkets elsewhere in Spain. Buy drinks here and put them in your mini-bar to keep cold. Save yourself a fortune. Next to El Corte Ingles is another shopping centre with lots of VERY nice shops. Also quite a few VERY nice food places downstairs - good for lunch and quick snacks.For a reasonable price meal turn right out of Hilton and walk about 1Km to GINOS. Very friendly, good food, good prices. Around the corner to the right from GINOS is La Bo Tiga - a new contemporary eatery. Great staff, great ambiance, great food and stunning prices. It is bright and new. It is also a great place to eat.The city is well documented elsewhere but in just 3 days we had an excellent time. Lots and lots of walking - the best way to see a city. We never got to La Rambla though.Go there .... and don't forget the cable car over the harbour - take your camera!!PW  GS

<Content>Nice hotel, location is a bit outside but not bad The hotel is a bit better than your average Hilton, rooms are a bit newer, however given that in Spain you can go to very nice stilish 4 star hotels, this one is not the best of all. I was on the executive floor and so rooms were supposedly a bit better than the rest, however the bathroom was old and, most important, THEY DID NOT HAVE NON SMOKING ROOMS ON THE EXECUTIVE FLOOR!!So the floor and the rooms smelled of cigar....Apart from this the location is not so central but not in the outskirts either, it's a residential area, so for businesspeople it's ok, for tourists maybe less.Overall a good hotel but not the best in Barcelona.

<Content>Hilton Diagonal - Wonderful! Best Hilton ever! Used Hilton points for a one-night stay before cruise. Clean! Fantastic executive lounge (but beware of the unpasturiezed fresh orange juice - trust me on this one). Not sure if they had a restaurant or not as the lounge had mixed drinks, beer, soda, food at night and wonderful mini-buffet for breakfast. Enjoyed views of the ocean and downtown Barcelona from the large lounge balcony.All sorts of nice surprises in the room - take with you slippers, nice toiletries, great bed, etc. Ask for an upper-level room with an ocean view. Doesn't appear to be the most convenient location for actually touring Barcelona, but great as a pre- or post- cruise stay. Fare to port was @ $20 EUR.

<Content>Great Experience! My boyfriend and I (we are in our early 30s) stayed here for 4 days during our first trip to Barcelona, and we thought it was great (especially when we compared it to the hotel we stayed at in Madrid). The taxi ride was about 20 euro from the airport. The staff were really friendly at check-in and immediately gave us a map and directions for getting to the main tourist areas. The hotel lobby and bar area are really nice and have modern decor. The room was a decent size with a pretty comfy bed. Also, our air conditioning worked very well - we heard a lady complaining at the front desk that her AC was not working and they immediately gave her a different room. The location of the hotel was good, especially since the Metro is just a few minutes away (walking). If you want to be very close to Las Ramblas then this is not the hotel for you - it is about a 20 min. Metro ride to Las Ramblas but in my opinion, there is only so much of Las Ramblas that you can take - to us it was nice to get a break from that really busy area. There is great shopping and restaurants in both directions upon exiting the hotel, and we agree with the last reviewer that the Si Senor restaurant located right outside the hotel is great! We had a great experience at this hotel and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great surprise When it comes to Hilton hotels I admit that I am not unbiased. I often chose this hotel chain (where available and when affordable). The recent reviews made me feeling uneasy when booking my 3 nights' stay. To my greatest relief all uneasiness vanished immediatly during the absolutely accommodating check in.I stayed at the executive floor on 6th floor and my comments are as following: the rooms are spartanically arranged and do not really invite to spend much time in there (regardless of the city at your door step, a hotel room should be inviting and comfortable). The bed was perfect and so was the air conditioning. This was one of the best I ever experienced.The executive lounge is not very inviting either. Somehow the furbishment throughout appears to look unsuccessful. Nevertheless the items offered in the lounge were good.What really made my stay was the staff. They were absolutely helpful (on request) and always there when needed. Plus the touch stone of all house-keeping in every upscale hotel: the turn-down service (on request only) did a wonderful job.The Hilton Barcelona is a little out of the way. There is an underground within easy walking distance and there is a bus stop at the door step (no 67 goes to Plaza Catalunya directly).If not opting for a very central location, I would return to this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>Whats the matter with you people? Firstly can I just start by asking what the hell is wrong with you people?This is a top class hotel in the heart of the fianancial district. It costs about 鈧?0 to get to the hotel from the airport, and upon arriving at the hotel you are really well looked after.This hotel DOES have that WOW factor, and let me tell you I am not easily pleased. I am a connoisseur of fine 5* establishments, and this hotel is one of them. OK, the rooms are a little on the small side, but for most city hotels this can sometimes be the case. You shouldn't really want to spend much time in your room anyway in such a great city, but even if your on business the rooms are equipped with everything one would expect from a 5* hotel. I was on the executive floor which gained me access to the executive lounge, but I didn't bother with it, as I really wasn't in the hotel for long during the day. You can eat in the hotel, but to be honest there are so many Tapas bars and eateries in the area you really needn't bother. Right opposite the hotel is bar called Si Senoir and they served food too. It stays open late and is a really great place. It's alot cheaper to drink in here (鈧?.60 a pint) as opposed to the hotel which charges 鈧? a pint!! Crikey, thats a bit much even for me!I gave this hotel 4/5 because of it's location. A little out of the way from the main city area (las Ramblas etc). I think it costs about 鈧?2 to get there from the hotel. From there you can get a taxi to Sagrada Familiar for around 鈧?5 or get the subway from one of the many stops. Overall I liked this hotel, I would return and when I have a little more time on my hands I'll post some photos. If you want to stay right on Las Ramblas street, try the Plaza, otherwise choose this hotel.

<Content>A Real Stinker What a disappointment the Hilton Barcelona was. The small room with its spare, supposedly modern furnishings I found downright ugly and deeply depressing - and this was on the executive floor. The staff were unfriendly and seemed totally disinterested. The nicest thing I can say is the room had a nice bathroom but no exhaust fan. The air conditioning didn't seem to work very well either. Thank goodness we had only reserved one night. That was one night too many!

<Content>Middling This American traveler found the Hilton Barcelona to be competently run with sufficient English-speaking staff to be a pleasant stay. I was glad to see that the room size was about standard for this class of hotel in a typical U.S. business destination, rather than a more cramped room one often discovers in Europe. I'm generally receptive to contemporary furnishings and decorations but found the Hilton Barcelona seems to have acquired room furnishings that stress design far above functionality. The chair in the standard room was almost unusuable in that the cushion would mould to your body shape and slip out of the chair frame. The drawers in the room look cool but are ALL at floor level--which might present a problem for elderly visitors as you have to bend all the way to the ground to put anything away in a drawer. Plus, there aren't that many drawers; I filled every drawer in the room with stuff I had brought in the pockets of a single garment bag--with all the hanging stuff in the closet (which was amply sized). As with many hotels that have undergone something less than a complete makeover, the bathrooms appear to have gotten more attention than the rest of the room. Bathrooms are 4-star or better. Common spaces in the hotel are getting near that point of appearing dated, and the hotel exterior is uninspiring. Also, as a traveler with limited Spanish and no Catalon, I noted that having two Hiltons in Barcelona on Avinguda Diagonal and a street numbering system that I never fully grasped, simply providing the name and street name and number of this particular property was often insufficient for the taxi driver to discern which hotel to go to. Taxi service outside this Hilton was ALWAYS available; I note this because I was attending a conference at a higher-rated hotel in Barcelona where taxi services was frequently a lonnng wait. This Hilton is less than half mile to Metro station and has grocery/food court options nearby. Didn't even consider breakfast as flat charge (I think Euro 22), with no cheaper a la carte choices, seemed exorbitant.

<Content>Excellent I stayed here last September with my Girlfriend and it is an excellent hotel. I cant think of a single thing to fault it on. The food in the restaraunt is first class. The staff are very helpful and the rooms are both large and modern. It's centrally located and is close to the Underground station which is very handy. You can get a train straigt from the airport (a few euros) or get a taxi if you prefer. The Nou Camp is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel (when we stayed there Shaktar Donesk were playing Barca in the Champions and the team stayed at the hotel. It was funny seeing them playin in the nou camp then see-ing them at breakfats the next morning) I have to note that, Las Ramblas is a fair hike away from the hotel but you can easily get the bus/train or a 15 Euro taxi (that you'll need to use if you party late on a sunday night (metro sutdowns on a Sunday night))I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Excellent for a short break Stayed here for 2 nights using rewards ponts and have HHonors Gold card so had access to the executive lounge which included free drinks, snacks, and breakfast. We really couldn't fault the hotel at all. The service was excellent, the rooms quiet and airy (excellent aircon - not normally a fan (excuse the pun) but the atmopshere in the room was just right), comfy bed, and good bathroom It has to be said we didn't pay anything the whole time we were there so we might be slightly biased , but even so we would still recommend it. The only negative would have to be its location. If you want to be in the thick of it you have to take a 10 Euro taxi drive. Getting a taxi was never a problem and we preferred the quiet after a busy day sightseeing.

<Content>Yawn, it's another Hilton It's a Hilton. If you've stayed in one before, you know what you're going to get. Soul-less luxury, well-trained but passionless staff, a feeling of anonymity. If you're paying for yourself (as opposed to business expenses), it's probably not worth the money. Only point where the Hilton Barcelona is above average is the decor, which looks modern and a little more characterful than the average 1970's brown and bronze, chandeliers and marble that most Hiltons seem to display.
