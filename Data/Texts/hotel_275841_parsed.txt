<Content>Fantastic location Confirm all the other reviews.This hotel has an amazing location. You are in the middle of everything. The hotel is situated on the 3rd floor, which is a bit strange. But there is an old lift , so no problem.Breakfast is very basic with coffee/tea bread and prepacked cakes. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and bathroom fine. Everything is within walking distance and no need for buses. The only time you need a bus if you are going to Fiosole. 4 minutes walk to bus stop. Trainstation is 8 minutes walk away, which is great , if you are catching the terravision bus to to Pisa airport, which is where the it leaves from.If you are looking for luxuery , this is not for you, but this a very confortable hotel and for the location , brilliant.We went in October and it seems the main tourist season over, so percect time to go. In the summermonths ,when Forence is very hot this would be an ideal hotel as it is so central , and you can pop in and out to refresh and rest , before next sightseeing stint!Would stay there again.

<Content>Great Location Great experience with this hotel. About a 10 minute walk from main train station. One block from the Duomo and about 5 minutes from The David. We really liked our location. Plenty of resturaunts and shops close by. Room was great--very big for European hotel rooms. Rooms were very clean. Shower was small and our double bed was 2 twins pushed together. Our room did have a minibar in it as well. Staff was very friendly and all spoke English. Very helpful about sites and dinner recommendations. They gave us 2 places and they were our best meals of our entire trip to italy. Marionis and Za-Za's. Great!! The staff also recommended a great shopping area. The hotel also has an internet card you can purchase. 5 euros for 1 hour. Breakfast was probably the only negative we have about this hotel. Just average. All food was pre-packaged. cereal, pastries, toast and coffee. We would definately stay at this hotel again. Room was clean and big, great staff, close to many attractions and train...we would probably just buy our breakfast.

<Content>Great Value and Location! Was looking for something in Central Florence and this hotel does not get any closer, as you are literally in the center of all the action.Room was clean, washroom was good, staff were friendly and free wi-fi in the lobby area.The breakfast was nothing great but for the price you can accept that.

<Content>Confirming previous reviews I stayed there with my wife for 5 nights after reading the many positive reviews and getting an excellent price through the hotel website (half the price of any other sites). Do not stay there if you are looking forward to stuffing yourself with a massive breakfast as you will have the same basic breakfast every morning. The important thing is the location as well as the friendliness and most importantly the cleanlisness and the comfort of the bedroom. The main Piazza of this wonderful city is only.....15 metres away from the hotel door....a bargain and excellent to get a shortbreak midday or to freshen up before eating out. Better than a 3 star hotel which is badly located and which would require taxi/long walk or bus trip!!

<Content>Amazing Location I must say that it doesn't get much closer than this. This hotel can almost be considered as next door to the Duomo. It is right in the centre of Florence, just a few minutes walk from most major attractions. It is situated on the 3rd floor, but luckily an elevator is a available for service. Note that there was no large sign on the hotel building so it's easy to miss. From the moment we arrived, very accomodating service staff were always willing to help. We had a late train on our check-out day but we were able to leave our bags in the hotel while we continued to tour the city. It was about a 10-15 minute walk from the train station.We stayed in room 101. It was a very large room with a large bathroom. It had a wonderful view of the Duomo. If you don't mind street noise, then I would highly recommend this room. The other rooms are smaller, but all were very clean and comfortable. Living this close to the Duomo, means that the first church bells of the day start to ring at 7am. I would definitely come back and stay here.

<Content>Superb location This hotel was literally across the street from the Duomo... you simply couldn't stay any closer. Although we didn't have a view of the Duomo, what we could see from our windows was beautiful. The room was a good size with all we needed. There was a mustiness that immediately disappeared once we opened the windows for a moment, and an odd smell to the towels... like vinegar almost. It was enough for my sensitive nose to break out my travel towel, so in the long run no problem whatsoever. The staff was great, and the elevator made it easy to get to. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent location and price The location is excellent, and rooms very clean and well maintained.If you are looking for a 'fancy' hotel with consierge, pool etc this is not the place for you.However if like most of us all you need is a clean, big room with bathroom and air conditiong with low prices then this place is a must. I cannot recomend it highly enough

<Content>good value  My wife  I stayed here upon return to Florence. The location is unbeatable for the center. Staff was very helpful and did their best to help us through getting me to the airport early in face of a taxi strike. They showed a caring attitude that went way beyond the mere delivery of expected service. Our room was clean, well appointed - better than I've come to expect in this price range. Would we stay here again? Absolutely!

<Content>Great Location My wife, daughter and I stayed at the Aldini for three days in early April 2007. Although I knew that it was close to the Duomo, I was stunned to see how close. You are literally steps away. It is right in the center of everything, and Florence being a walking city, the location was perfect. The staff could not have been more helpful. The room (a triple) was large and clean. Only drawbacks: because this particular room was right on the main street leading to the Duomo, it was very noisy, even at night. Crowds of loud partiers would occasionally interrupt sleep. So, get a room in the back. Also, wireless internet service was sporadic. All in all, however, I would recommend it for those who want to be close to the action, and not spend an arm and a leg.

<Content>Duomo at the door So many people begin reviews with location, location, location that it is bit hackneyed, but there is no other way to start a review of the Aldini. Step out of the front door, and you are within arm's reach, literally, of the Duomo and bell tower. There is no hotel in Florence closer or better located. It is on the 4th floor of the building, but the lift worked perfectly. The massive front door gives way to a rather drab hall that might give one pause, but don't be put off. The rooms are large, the bathrooms large, spotless and with good water pressure and nice towels, the front desk attended 24 hrs a day by hosts Antonio and his sister Elizabetta, who both speak impeccable English. We were there in Feb., so I can't speak for the airconditioning, but the heat worked very well. Most of the windows don't open onto the square, but it just doesn't matter. You are right there, reminded that this, in fact, is why you wanted to come to Florence in the first place.

<Content>Fantastic! The location is great, our room was HUGE, and the staff could not have been more helpful. They were always willing to help us make restaurant reservations or to point us in the right direction. Rooms were clean and bright. Because the hotel is so close to the Duomo, you can hear the kids hanging out in the piazza at night. And watch out for those church bells at 7:00 AM!

<Content>Absolutely delightful! This hotel was great for someone on a budget but who still wants a charming room in a great location, awesome view, and excellent customer service. It was a nice change from our room in Rome which was more expensive and far smaller. This room was quite large and have a view of the Duomo. I couldn't hear any street noise at night (except the bells of the Duomo when I was already awake) and the staff was great. Room was also clean and comfortable -- will definitely return.

<Content>superb! We stayed here for a full week in March,2006. We had two rooms (numbers 1 and 2) with superb views of the Duomo. There's an elevator as well. The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable and the bathrooms quite good. The breakfasts (cafe late with fresh bread and juice) were quite adequate. The hotel is on one of the main pedestrian shopping streets, but can still be a little noisy at night (although I had no problems when the window was closed). The staff is very friendly and helpful (they recommended a great restaurant area). I will definitely stay here again!

The room is clean, and spacious (by European standard). The shower is a bit tight even for a petite like me but otherwise I am very happy with the choice. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great value We stayed at hotel Aldini in spring 2004. It was close enough that we could walk from the train station (though not recommended if you have heavy luggage!). The view from our room was great- could see the duomo from the french doors. The room was large, pretty clean, though the bed was not the greatest. The breakfast was very basic. But I had no complaints. We paid about 85 euro and had the best location and good service. It's not a luxury hotel, but there is nothing wrong with it- the location makes it a great bargain. I would stay there again.

<Content>A Room With a View The Aldini is a good budget choice for Florence with a great location. I was originally booked for the Costantini (floor below). The two hotels are either jointly-owned or collaborators, since they put me in the Aldini when I checked in. Tiny room, but working bathroom, TV, mini-fridge. From my window, I could see the tower of the Duomo looming over us! Breakfast nothing to write home about, staff friendly. The Piazza del Duomo is literally right outside the door, and it's a quick walk to Piazza della Signoria, Uffizi, and Ponte Vecchio.

<Content>Another vote for Hotel Aldini Had a triple room for one night in Oct, 2004. Room (#114?) was very large with 4 beds, TV, desk, small refrigerator and nice-sized bathroom w/shower. Room had view of other buildings' rooftop but if craned neck out of a side window far enough can see top of Duomo. Hotel is in excellent location just steps away from Duomo and easy walking to other sights. Hotel is on Via Calzaiuoli which is a smaller street w/ more pedestrians than cars so it's not very noisy at night. There are restaurants and shops right outside the hotel. Hotel is on third floor w/ lift. Staff was nice and efficient. Breakfast is one floor down in Hotel Constantin. We also stayed at Hotel Constantin and saw the same staff there so both hotels must be under the same management. Breakfast was OK with coffe, juice, rolls served by two friendly women.

<Content>Great location, didn't like the beds I agree with all the positive feedback I read in the other reviews. The staff was very friendly, one woman recommended three outstanding restaurants (try Agua Al 2 behind the Bargello), and the location was very central. We didn't have a view of the Duomo, but that's ok.On the downside, the bed in our room desperately needed to be replaced. It felt like a sofabed.Breakfast was ok, rolls, jelly, and coffee, but lacked any kind of protein. We brought in our own salami from Tuscany for some protein, so that wasn't a big deal.

<Content>Great Location!! Stayed in this hotel for two nights in July 2004. It is located just 2 minutes from the Duomo and takes up one floor of the building. Our room had a great view of the Duomo and we could hear the bells ringing in the morning. This hotel really is a find, it is family run, clean and reasonably priced for the location which is second to none. Less than 10 minutes walk to all the main sights. The breakfast is basic but adequate for a 2 star hotel. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel in the heart of Florence and the fact that it has air conditioning is a must in Italy in summer. Great price. Contact the hotel directly for its prices, also eurocheapo.com features it.

<Content>Clean, Convenient and Quiet We booked a triple room for June 29, 2004. The rooom was spacious - had four twin beds, TV, desk and wardrobe and a good-sized bathroom with shower. The hotel occupies one floor of the building but is nicely laid out and comfortable. People at the front desk were very nice and went out of their way to help where they could. They watched our luggage after we checked out so we could do some added sight-seeing. The breakfast room was one flight down but we had plenty to eat and were pleased with the service. Waking up to the bells from the Campanile was a real treat. A good memory from Florence.

<Content>Loved the Aldini What a pleasure to stay at Hotel Aldini. Immaculate rooms, quiet hotel, air conditioning, spacious rooms, very good breakfast, very polite staff and the owners are a most wonderful couple who did all they could to make our stay pleasant. They work terribly hard to be sure everything is just right. Tutto a posto. They helped us with calling taxis, getting us reservations to the top museums: Uffizi, Accademia, etc., gave us maps, recommended the most happening restaurant Latini where we met and had the most memorable meal, gave us advice, and even served us hot coffee in the mornings! The hotel is just across from the Duomo and two doors down. Can't get a better location than that. Our streets were very quiet at night so we were well rested and refreshed. We went on to many other hotels on our stay in Europe, but this little hotel even beat out our 4 star in Lourdes! Hotel Aldini lived up to the recommendations I read on this site. A great bargain. I hope they keep their prices as fair in the future as they will undoubtedly grow in popularity!

<Content>Great Location Three women stayed at this hotel from March 16 through March 18 2004. The room was large with plenty of space. The bathroom was also large and had a shower instead of a bath which we preferred. We had a terrible time trying to make calls out using calling card. The front desk had one person that was very helpful others not impressive. The location was just outside the Duomo with wonderful views. We felt safe with plenty of places to eat around us.
