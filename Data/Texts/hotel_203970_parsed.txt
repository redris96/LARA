<Content>So bad we had to laugh I don't consider myself a high-maintenance guest, but this hotel was so bad I felt the need to write my first TripAdvisor review. We stayed at the Sheraton Firenze around Christmastime and it was nearly empty -- combine that with the old and dated decor and it became somewhat like The Shining. But that would've been fine had the hotel not been so bad in so many other ways.1. Location -- Bad. The hotel is a good 20 minutes outside of Florence and the shuttle service only runs about 8 times a day, with a large gap in the middle of the day. The last shuttle to the hotel leaves the Florence train station at 9:30pm, so don't even think about staying out too late unless you're ready to pay 30 euro for a cab back.2. Food/Drink -- Horrible and overpriced. We ordered two glasses of wine from the bar to bring up to the room -- both were not just bad, they literally had gone bad. We still got charged for them, despite notifying the bartender.3. Service/Attentiveness -- Horrible. I asked for a 8am wake-up call and I didn't get it because my phone didn't work, causing me to oversleep by 2 hours. When I told them, they didn't apologize. I asked them to fix my phone while I was gone and they sent someone up. I arranged another wake-up call for the following morning and AGAIN it did not go through -- my phone STILL did not work and they didn't take the time to tell me that before I made another wake-up call.4. Rooms -- Okay. The decor is dated, but the rooms were comfortable enough. The biggest problems were the shower and the hairdryer, which had almost no pressure and were an annoyance to use.Pay a little extra and stay in the city. It will be worth it.

<Content>one night only sheraton firenzemon 15 sept, one nightcouple traveling by carhad no real issues during our one night, and really enjoyed ourbrief stay, however we would have preferred to have chosen ahotel closer to the city center. location is convenient if youare on the road as the hotel is very close to the highway, butthe environment/surroundings could be better.pluses:very friendly staff, and excellent service.very spacious and clean room with very comfortable beds andlarge bathroom.sound insulation in room ok (highway is close, but was no issue).hotel shuttle connects guests with city center throughoutthe day at convenient (but limited) times as a complementaryservice (time hotel to firenze main train station at piazza stamaria novella approx 20 min, local traffic permitting).continental breakfast ok.availability of open and closed parking spaces.a special thanks goes out to the night receptionist who preparedhot tea for both of us at 3 o'clock in the morning without anycharge (no 24-hrs room service and hotel kitchen closed at thetime), as we both had a flu and were in desperate need for sometea.minuses:very tired hotel, in need of an urgent refurbishment in and out.our room window on the 4th floor had a serious oversize crack,and was in need of replacement.internet access with credit card charges next to reception only.hotel surroundings and buildings (garage building for example)look very abandoned.hotel shuttle service stops early in the evening, and there is noconnection during night hours.no city view, location not far outside of city, but behind hills,convenient only if traveling by car (that may well be a plus).breakfast would be nice to have fresh juices and scrambled eggs,as a standard offering.would generally consider the hotel as overpriced because of theabove.overall impression:we enjoyed our brief stay, and would have no objection to visitthis hotel again, although we will try for something closer tothe city center next time. from what we've seen, hotels infirenze are highly overrated and overpriced.

<Content>Blot on the lanscape This hotel is an eyesore. It is almost an embarrassment to stay there as the building itself is such a blot on the landscape. The service is however reasonable. The interior decor is very tired and needs replacing and updating. The shuttle service into town is very limited and inflexible.I would not stay there again.

<Content>Sheraton OK Stayed at Sheraton Hotel  Conference Center Firenze for two nights while on an Insight Tour. Room was nice and reasonable size by EU standards, bed comfortable, bathroom great. Breakfast average. Hotel was very clean and staff were available and took care of requests immediately. Only problem with hotel is that it is not near center of Florence. 8 Euro cab ride to Ufizzi or hotel shuttle bus. If you have limited time in Florence stay in Florence center. If you have many days this hotel is nice as it is out of the city center.

<Content>Good hotel friendly staff Stayed there for two nights. It is a good modern by Italian standards hotel. Large and clean rooms. It was farther away from the city than I thought (about 1/2 hour by cab or shuttle bus). They do provide a free shuttle to the railway station and have shuttle schedule on their website. It goes probably avery hour and a half or so. If you plan to stay the whole day in Florence, the accommodation is not that bad, but remember that this hotell is literraly in the middle of countryside. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I send them e-mail before we arrived, asked to make reservation for Uffizi Gallery, they responded righ away with confirmation number. As a side remark, Uffizi is grossly overrated, I cannot understand people who were standing in 4-hour line to buy a ticket. If you want to visit Uffizi, book ticket in advance for a specific time. But I would not reccomend going there, there are so many other things to do in Florence. Somebody complaied here about not being able to use hair dryer. That's unfortunattely true, Italian regulations also dose not allow to have coffee maker in the room. Was somewhat dissappointed, but this has nothing to do with that particular hotel.

<Content>Florence Sheraton Hotel was your slightly above average Sheraton. Nice enough room with king sized bed, TV and fridge. Located out of downtown a ways just off the Autostrada. However, a free shuttle was provided going back and forth to the tourist area multiple times per day. No easy parking in Florence so this was the way to go! We used Starwood points for three days with no problems.

<Content>Perfect for conferences and meetings I've stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in April during the conference that we had in this hotel. I was travelling with a friend and we had a twin room. The bed size was OK for the single bed, but it was extremely uncomfortable, so were the pillows. Also, it was freezing cold, and both of us had to ask for extra blanket. Also, it is not possible to use your own hairdryer - which is rediculous considering the fact that the built-in one was made probably in 1960. The included breakfast buffet was something you would expect in a 2-3* hotel. Literally, NOTHING special.Now, the good things.As I was one of the meeting organizers, I interacted a lot with the hotel staff and all of them were great, especially the meeting managers. The hotel meeting amenities are superb, plenty of different meeting rooms, all in a very good shape, all the set-up was done well in advance and all the changes that we've made along the way were immediately taken into consideration and received the necessary attention.. Also, we were afraid that people who would be attending the conference would sneak out to do some sightseeing, but the weather was not very nice, and also, there are no shuttle buses during the day, so everyone stayed. Overall, if you are planning a meeting or a conference that needs to go very well, use this hotel. But be aware that accommodation is truely 3*.

<Content>Inconvenient location The hotel is on the outskirts of town , shuttles to go, but you have to return by taxi. Not convenient for shopping or other attractions. Comfortable, clean and would be a nice place to return to, however, this was my first stay at this hotel - probably last. This solely because I want to be in Florence to shop, side walk cafes at night, the ambience of the history is important to me. Please understand, no complaint about hotel........location only

<Content>Great hotel but hot rooms and rusty water We have stayed 3 times at this hotel by now. It is a very nice hotel with very pleasant and helpful English speaking staff. However this time we started with a room on the 5th floor but despite the fact that the heater was off, the room was like a sauna and opening the winfow did little to relieve this situation even at night despite cool weather outside. Additionally, the water that came out of the tap was quite rusty and unpleasant to use. We then asked to be moved to the third floor which initially appeared to be cooler but quickly became warm during the day  night and with rusty water also. The staff said it had all to do with a boiler that needs to be replaced. I would think a chain like the Sheraton would not delay such an essential repair.

<Content>Enjoyed my two night stay This hotel is much nicer that the pictures show it to be. The rooms were spacious and the bathroom was too. The rooms were nice as was the lobby and restaurants. We had a room by the main road and could not hear the traffic. I would definitely stay there again. We were a bit of a drive from the city center, but that was just fine. Florence to me is not hard to get around so location was not an issue.

<Content>Very good hotel if location fits your needs We spent two nights at the Sheraton Firenze November 24 and 25, 2007. We were aware that this hotel is on the southern edge of Florence and not close to city center. However, as we were driving and wanted to spend a bit of time in Florence and then do some driving and exploring of the Tuscan countryside south of town (including Sienna and San Gimignano) we found the location to be ideal. We had been in Venice and drove from there to Florence. It was quite easy to locate the Sheraton as it is just off the Firenze Sud Autostrada exit. It is also very nicely located to the S222 road which winds through the Chianti region of Tuscany and leads directly to Sienna. Another big plus is that the parking is free at the hotel.The hotel from the outside appears to be very plain and does not appear to be anything special. However, upon entering all is quite nice. The lobby and public spaces are bright and done mostly in marble and granite. There is a large bar and restaurant on the main level. We were given a room on the fifth floor and were quite pleased with the room. It was large, with a queen size bed, large desk, table with two arm chairs, a flat screen TV, digital safe, and a large and fully equipped bathroom. Full amenities were provided in the bathroom and the mini-bar could be used to store our own wine and drinks. Overall the room was in all respects as nice as any Sheraton we have used anywhere in the world.There was only one complaint about the room and that was the fact that there was no control of the central heat. The room was extremely hot during the day but then cooled down to a pleasant level in the evening. We asked the desk about this and they suggested we could open the windows to help cool it off until the room cooled on its own. It appears that the upper floors are warmer than the lower ones and it would be advisable to request a room on a lower floor during the colder months. The issue of the heat was very minor to us as we spent little time in the room during the day. The hotel provides a free shuttle to central Florence. The shuttle operates on a set schedule which means that if you want to go into Florence outside of the set times you will need to have the hotel call a taxi. The shuttle drops off in three different locations but only picks up in front of the main train station. If the shuttle is not convenient the cab fare from the hotel to central Florence (for example, to the Pont Vecchio) is about 17 Euros.Our room rate included breakfast. The breakfast was substantial and included the typical items such as cereals, yogurts, breads, cheeses, meats, fruit and self serve coffee including a very decent cappuccino (even though it was machine made). The breakfast was excellent in all respects.We were very happy with the Sheraton Firenze and it met our needs perfectly based on our plans. It would not be a good choice for someone that wanted to spend several days in Florence exploring as the location is a bit remote. It would also not be a good choice for anyone arriving by train. It should also be noted that it is a popular hotel for tour companies. While we were there a large group from Japan also was booked, but since breakfast for the group was in a separate room from the normal dining room there was no crowding.Overall the Sheraton is a nice hotel and if the location fits ones travel plans it is a good choice in suburban Florence.

<Content>Typical Conference/Meeting Hotel My wife and I used 4000 Starwood point to stay at Sheraton Firenze for one night, having decided to break our trip via train from Naples to Venice and have a very quick look around Florence.The hotel was typical of any hotel that primarily caters for business meetings, conferences, etc.Our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable, meeting our expectations. The hotel is not close enough to town to walk, but served its purpose well. Rather than use 20000 points to stay at a Starwood property (Westing Excelsior or Grand Hotel) in Florence proper, I was happy to save the 16000 points, and pay for taxis back and forth between Florence and Sheraton Firenze during our twenty four hour stopover.The one time we tried to use the shuttle from town (they drop off and pick up opposite Firenze stazione) it was full, and they do not allow passengers to stand.From what little we were able to see during our much too short stay, we decided that we will spend at least three days in Florence on our next trip to Italy.

<Content>Checked out early to find another hotel Outside appearance including the lobby is very nice. The hotel is clean, but seems to be more of a business or conference type of hotel rather than for tourists.We were disappointed that the pool was closed, even though the weather was still quite warm  there are no other attractions without leaving the property via car, shuttle or taxi.Not convenient to tourist sites of Florence. Free hotel shuttle service into the city doesn't run very often, unacceptable as to convenience. Taxi rides thus get very expensive. Bed was the hardest, most uncomfortable we have ever tried to sleep on. And the room which was supposed to be non-smoking had tell-tale smell of smoke. We asked if another room with a more comfortable bed was available in a non-smoking room  the hotel very willingly accomodated us. Although the reassigned room had a much cleaner smell, and the bed was marginally more comfortable, we checked out the next morning and moved into a mainstream downtown Florence hotel where we could walk to everything for the remainder of our stay. Of course we paid a much higher price, but it was definitely worth it.I am usually quite positive in giving reviews, but would recommend tourists from the USA choose a different hotel for your stay in Florence.JK from Salt Lake City, UT

<Content>Not as bad as we thought! We stayed here for one night on Aug 31, 2007 as the rest of our nights in Florence were spent closer to the main attractions. So we took the complimentary shuttle in the evening from the Metro station where it makes its routine stops. The check-in was fast and smooth and we had a really nice room with a view of the pool. We knew from other reviews that lots of tour groups stay here so we checked out their schedule which was posted in the lobby and made sure we ate dinner earlier than they were and that our checkout first thing in the morning wasn鈥檛 at the same time as theirs. The hotel was nice, clean and had frequent shuttles to the main points (i.e.: Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, Metro). The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful in answering all our questions. The food was great (dinner) and we enjoyed the hotel as there weren't too many people staying there at the time. We wouldn鈥檛 mind staying here again though we prefer to stay closer to the attractions in case we need a siesta!

<Content>Wonderful service We stayed at the Sheraton in Florence one night on our recent vacation and loved it. I booked it using my points from starwood. The hotel is very nice with a large marble bathroom and the tv actually had a channel besides CNN in English. The view from the room was also very nice, hilly countryside. The hotel is located a short drive outside of the actual city center but has a complimentary shuttle that takes you back and forth throughout the day and is very punctual. The front desk was extremely helpful and spoke perfect English. I would return

The pool wasn't open when we were there (early June) and the tennis court was completely overgrown and had large branches on the court and huge weeds everywhere. The service was mixed - from indifferent to helpful. It seemed to cater to tour bus groups and Italian business groups.

<Content>Not as far as expected The hotel is in the beautiful florence countryside, close to the highway.Choose it: for the price, in comparison with the downtown historical hotels; because it's pretty close to the centre BUT only if you are driving your own car (this was a pleasant suprise, since we expected the worst): it takes some 7/10 mins. to get to the Duomo and they have a complinetary shuttle.Dont't choose it if: you expect something different from the average Sheraton; you want walk around; if you like very good breakfasts.The room was better than expected, but a little bit cold (I'm talking about the temperature), and also good was, overall, the interior of the hotel.Nice staff.

It is on the outskirts of town and unaccessible on foot. Plan for at least a 20Euro cab fair to get into town.On a postive note this is a Sheraton. The rooms are American Size with American bedding adn this hotel has an ice maker.

<Content>Ease and comfort. Perfect hotel for those using Florence as a base to other tuscan towns. If you have a car and kids then in my opinion there is no other choice than the Sheraton. The complimentary shutle into the city is perfect. The hotel has great facilities including large outdoor pool, large clean rooms and confortable bar and lobby and all for a very reasonable price. This is not the luxury hotel for that extra special holiday that but if you are vacationing with the family this is a special place to call home for a few nights. Very comfortable indeed.

<Content>Only for Points I have to admit to having chosen this hotel only because of getting some bonus points. It is not a good choice for people wanting to see Firenze as was mentioned several times in earlier reviews. The problem of the distance of the hotel is not really solved by the shuttle bus because it takes so long to ride it to the city. There is also the problem of getting to the airport which takes a good hour in traffic. The service in the restaurant at breakfast is rather pleasant, but the food and the table settings are quite bad. There are no hot dishes but only breads, smoked meats, fruit, and some awful pastries. One should opt for cappucino as opposed to coffee as the regular coffee comes from a machine that spits out some kind of bitter swamp juice.The front desk reception is a mixture of good service and bad - depends on who is there at the time. One employee was very cheerful and replied nicely (although his claim that the airport was 30 minutes away proved completely untrue). Another told me it was impossible to give a refund for the pay phone that ate my money because the phones were not owned by the hotel. The bus drivers generally are bored with their job, and there seems to be a rather silly policy that if you arrive early to the shuttle bus at the SM Novella station you will not be allowed on board. The driver kept saying - You didn't see me, I am in park mode! It is illegal to get on the bus now!!! You must walk over to the opposite side near to the station where you can board at 9:30pm (it was 9:24 and the bus parks near the Bass shoe store).Another problem with the hotel is that if you get tired early and decide to go back before eating dinner, then there is no where to eat besides the same restaurant as the breakfast or the room service which is really not a good choice. The vegetable soup at 12 Euros is a joke for value! The rooms are OK - not really top quality or pretty even, but they are quite clean. The noise level depends on who is sleeping near you as the walls are a bit on the thin side.Overall I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless someone wanted Starwood points and was driving through with a car and only wanted a decent room that wasn't north of $200.

What a pleasant surprise I received as soon as we arrived at the Sheraton Firenza. It has a lovely lobby with a friendly staff. Most of the people working at the front desk spoke english very well. The rooms were larger than the average european hotel rooms  very clean. The bathrooms were exceptional with large fluffy towels  once again, very clean. Although I had the advantage of getting to the historic district courtesy of Globus, my friends  I stayed through the evening  took a taxi back to the Sheraton. The taxi fare was 10 euros. After staying 2 nights, I was happy with my experience  would gladly stay again.

<Content>Shame on Sheraton - this hotel hurts their name I just came back from a business meeting over the past three days at this hotel. I would not recommend it to anyone for several reasons. First, the staff is not there to serve their guests. Too many times we had to insist that they do something in order to meet our needs. This was true from the banquet staff to the person working the bar. I don't think they like their jobs, nor their guests! Second, the hotel can use a shot of investment. The rooms are tired, walls made of tissue paper and spit, beds are rock hard and tiny. Third, it is significantly outside of town, with a cab costing about 17 Euros each way. That in itself can add up and make staying in town, where you can walk around this gorgeous city, much more attractive.And finally, the food in the hotel is simply low grade. The food in town is fabulous in this city of great restaurants. But the hotel food was tasteless, poorly prepared, and left us all disappointed. Sometimes it was cold, and most of the times it was not fresh. Many times, the wait staff would bring you a cold coffee, or be resistant to a special request (i.e., how about a Coca Cola Light instead of regular Coke?). Big, big disappointment that reflects poorly on Sheraton.

<Content>Good hotel but very, very, very far from the city This hotel is very nice, however if you go to visit Florence I would not recommend it. It is about 30 min. from downtown Florence and the shuttle from the hotel stops working at 9:30 pm. Very, very inconvenient for a visitor to Florence. Pick a hotel closer to the downtown/historic area.

<Content>Nice hotel, but far away from everything I stayed here on May 27  28, 2004 as I was booked through a tour group. While this was a welcome hotel after my experience with a Rome hotel, it was located far away from everything. As someone already mentioned, the shuttles run infrequently, and our driver was one angry man. No one could understand a word he was saying, but he was MAD. I found the hotel rooms to be pretty spacious, considering the sizes of others in Italy. Clean rooms, quiet, etc. Desk clerks are almost completely indifferent to you, though. Buffet dinner was excellent, breakfast buffet same as every other Italian buffet. Nothing exciting. Cost us 12.69 Euros from train station to Sheraton.

<Content>Terrible Location Despite the name, do not think you will actually be in Florence.If it is a nice sized American style hotel room you are after, stay in America. If you want Florence, Italy stay in the city.I laughed when I saw that another reviewer stated that this was a great location.The hotel was nice enough and we did have a nice view and perhaps that's what the other reviewer meant by location. They also do provide shuttle service to and from Florence (a whopping 25 minutes each way) but I don't think there are enough shuttle trips especially in the evening. If you miss the 6 pm into Florence the next is at 8:00. The last shuttle back to the hotel is at 9:30 PM so it's tough to eat at a restaurnant and be back at the shuttle stop to make the last bus.Cabs are an alternate choice but they will run you approx $20 each way.I had the fortune of staying in a nice hotel in the center of Florence for the first half of the week and then we switched to the Sheraton for the second half due to our business convention being there. There was no comparison. As in real estate remember the rule: location, location, location.This Sheraton has a terrible location.

<Content>Beautiful location! My husband and I stayed at this hotel in Sept., 2001, for two nights. The hotel is also a conference center so it had a beautiful lobby, several ballrooms, ample grounds  plenty of parking. The rooms were larger than other comparable hotels we stayed in during our trip. The view from our room was magnificent - overlooking the pool and mountains in the background. The food was fine and it was the only hotel we stayed at in Italy which had an ice machine! The only drawback to this hotel was the fact that it was not situated in downtown Florence. There was a hotel shuttle to  from downtown but you had to mind the schedule or take a cab. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the hotel and service.
