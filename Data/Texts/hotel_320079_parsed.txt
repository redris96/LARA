<Content>Enjoyed staying at the St. Christopher Great Location. Easily walk to any spot in the French Quarter. Staff was courteous, friendly and very efficient. Nice rooms, good service. I highly recommend for anyone wanting to experience the French Quarter. My wife  I have a son who has moved nearby. We will be returning to visit again. We will definitely stay again at the St. Christopher Hotel in NOLA.

<Content>Not what we paid for As two participants of a conference in New Orleans, we decided to lower our costs and share a room. We paid for 6 nights of a 2 queen beds non-smoking room at St. Chistopher, taking advantage a discount coupon at hotels.com. At check-in, the hotel clerk Britney declared that the hotel was full and that she could only offer a smoking room with one king bed. Confronting my unhappiness, she further declared that at the hotel they did not care much about the customers booking their rooms at hotels.com or Expedia. My further communication with her was done through hotels.com. Unfortunately, the only thing they have offered was a cancellation of the reservation with no penalty on my part! Thereafter they suggested that I should call them next morning because their system was going down. With little that we could do right away, we took the room and eventually negotiated through hotels.com getting a 2-bed room after 2 nights in the hotel. St Christopher staff did not offer any other remedy to our problem such as a roll-away bed. Throughout our stay, Britney exuded bad mood towards us and, as far as I could tell, towards other customers as well. The second room had 2 beds, but no window.From other less grave issues, the free wireless internet turned out to be wired which can be a problem when 2 people need to work. The breakfast was generally OK but every second morning they ran out of something, such as coffee or spoons, with staff being hard to find or responding after you actually finished your breakfast.The hotel has a very convenient location, next to Canal St. The hotel building is historic, with some of the walls exposed to show the old brickwork. In our first room, the exposed wall had a sizable crack with a gauge put onto it to show whether the crack was growing in size. Fortunately it did not grow since the gauge was put on.

<Content>Not the Best I booked this hotel close to the French Quarter and River for its proximity to our conference site and the fact that we usually stay at and like Best Westerns. Plus, we had 2 nights points to redeem. Even with the free 2 nights, it wasn't too great. To begin with the street was noisy and street noise awoke me at 450 am the first morning even though we were on the 8th floor. Then, we asked for extra pillows 3 times to be told that there weren't any extra pillows! Only 2 pillows per queen size bed and 2 provided had small blood stains. I'm allergic to feathers  dust, both of which were plentiful in the only 2 pillows provided for the 2 of us. When I went to blow my noise, I used the only 2-3 tissues stuffed in the top of an empty tissue box in the bathroom. I was happy I had a pillow in the car from our long drive there, so used that the 2nd night.When we needed front desk service, they were generally dealing with an irate customer, on the phone, or in back no where to be seen or called--no bell or sign.Generally, the answer to any of our requests or inquiries was NO, not the yes one normally expects at a hotel with decent service.A variation on the NO them -When I though I'd lost my purse by leaving it in the hotel lobby, I asked the front desk clerk if I left it in the lobby and she said I don't know. No offer of assistance in finding my purse! When my fiance asked about my purse separate from me, the same clerk told him she didn't know anything.For food, we weren't told of the free breakfast upon check-in or given any printed notice of or signs for it anywhere. We found out about the free, mediocre continental breakfast upon leaving the hotel early one morning.Computing--there was no business center/computers to be found. When one business traveler asked if a package had arrived at the front desk for him, he got the same I don't know response we got after inquiring about my lost purse. Thank goodness it was in our room hidden under the bedspread.Taxis--we had to go across the street to the Sheraton to catch one. There was no one at our front desk to call one and the 3 taxi cab services we phoned had busy lines or no answer.Overcharging--we were charged a fee of about $124 for our one night's paid stay when we signed a contract for $89. We asked about this and the clerk said that we should've known $89 was not the correct rate when we made our reservation online. We were so eager to leave, we paid just for the privilege of fleeing without further adieu or argument.Even with the 2 nights free, this BW wasn't worth it.We were glad to leave!

<Content>Great Value, Great Location, Great Times in NOLA... Where else can you get a Brand Name hotel just feet from the French Quarter for 89.00 a night? I'm a 27 y.o. laid back male from NYC who was down there for a bachelor party. We didn't need luxury, nor did we want anywhere that was falling down or gross. All ten people in our group agreed that this hotel was amazing for what we needed. It's location is probably the best part; right across the street from the FQ and just 2 blocks from Harrah's casino. Rooms, although small, were super clean. Bathroom was spotless and check-in was a breeze. Delania at the front desk is one of the sweetest people we encountered down there. In the morning there is a little breakfast area where you can get snacks, coffee, tea, juices, etc. It's the same area where the bar is, although I must say the bar was never open. It's all good as there is a bar or 2 or 16 right down the street! If I had an unlimited budget and I wanted more amenities, I may stay elsewhere but for what we needed, this place was phenomenal. In fact, if I went back with my wife I would probably stay at this hotel. The value and location simply can not be beaten! Any questions, please ask krumblez3244@yahoo.com

<Content>A skylight over the bed? We stayed at the St Christopher in New Orleans for about 6 nights back in 2005 after getting a good deal from Hotwire.The hotel has a great location, just a couple blocks off of Canal street so it is easy walking distance to the French Quarter and all the attractions, without having the noise from Bourbon street party goers to keep you awake.The service was fair, a bit below average in friendliness and caring but that may have changed over the past 3 years. The room we had was on the second floor and apparently the building had undergone some remodeling at some point because I don't think the room would have intentionally been designed the way it was. As we entered the room it was like a hallway with the bathroom off to the right and the bedroom straight ahead. In the bedroom were two square pillars at the foot of the bed which seemed very out of place and rather in the way. The biggest problem I had with the room was the first morning when the sun came up it shone directly into the huge skylight in the ceiling directly over the bed! This thing was massive in size and had no shades or covering to block the light. We had to go buy eye masks to wear while sleeping because they were unable to change our room. The room had no other windows, so perhaps they kept the skylight there so you would not feel like you were in a tomb, but they should at least have had some sort of covering on it to prevent a rude awakening every morning. Unless there on business I doubt many visitors to New Orleans rise with the sun each morning....unless you're in that room where you have no choice.Most of the building is a high rise, we just happened to be in a section across the front that was only two stories high. Directly under our room was the bar where they had live entertainment which was easily heard in our room. So, not only could you not go to bed early because of the music, you could not sleep in because of the skylight. And did I mention the loud air conditioning in that room?Sleep was sorely lacking during that trip.No doubt the rest of the hotel has better, friendlier accommodations, we just happened to get stuck with (what I assume is) the worst room in the hotel.The bathroom was nice with tile floor and newer fixtures, but no counter space or shelves to put your things. Pretty, but a poor design for a hotel.This experience has caused me to stop letting Hotwire pick my hotel, I'll pay a higher price to know I won't get stuck in a room like that again. Looking back now we can laugh about the experience of staying there, but at the time it wasn't the least bit amusing. If you plan to stay at the Best Western St Christopher, make sure in advance that you don't get the room with the skylight over the bed.

<Content>Better than rated. We stayed at this hotel for two nights. It is a converted warehouse (or something like that), and there are exposed brick walls on at least one wall in the room. Nice look. Clean rooms. Bathrooms are all new and clean. Pedestal sink and nice, clean tubs/showers. Just a bit of 'good' quirkiness. It's about a hundred feet off Canal, which is a main street, but it seemed quiet enough. Just across Canal is the French Quarter and Bourbon Street no more than a five minute walk (or less). The casino is just a short walk down Canal. You can park your car in front of the hotel and unload, then drive straight down to the first traffic light (about two or three short blocks) and there is an open lot where you can park for $15-$20 per day. when you're ready to leave, just pull the car around the block and park in front of the hotel and load up. They have an okay continental breakfast. The usual. The nice thing is that the coffee machine was on 24 hours, so if you want coffee late at night, it's available in the lobby. The lobby isn't fancy and the front of the hotel isn't going to take your breath away, either, but the room was nice with new bathrooms. Probably the only negative (and it's not huge) was that the carpet in the room could have used a cleaning. I'd recommend this hotel based on my experience. Also, the only other slight negative was that when we first got to the hotel, there was nobody at the front desk and it took about five minutes for anyone to come out of the back room to the front. But, the guy was nice and the girl in the morning was nice, too. So, all in all, not a bad choice.

<Content>Decent hotel. Just dont expect customer service. Overall, the hotel is in fairly good condition and defintiely a good value for its price. It also has great location with French Quarter and Herrah's within 2 minutes of walking distance. If you have car, expect to pay $31/day for parking. I do have complaints though. I've been to many hotels over the years but I have never complained about the customer service until I stayed at this hotel. I wont go into details but dont expect any customer service. The check in was horrible as well as the checkout. The people in this hotel are either rude or just incompetent. Be sure to check your bill! Also, I didnt leave any tip one day and I found stack of towels on my bed. I dunno. Maybe the maid was really busy that day. the sheets arent changed each day, as I found hair on my bed. There was also used tissue stuffed the the tissue box as well as something disgusting on the headboard. Anyways, the hotel has good points and bad points and I think the good points outweigh the bad ones overall. But I persoanlly would not pick this hotel as my first choice for sure though.

<Content>Very good choice - unless you come by car Nice and clean hotel, friendly staff (well, most of them at least), breakfast OK (cereals, bagels, bread, fruits, yogurt, coffee, juice, eggs, wafers). Amongst the various Best Western hotels I have visited around the world this is one of the better ones. No wireless in the room, but network cable in the room worked fine. Safe was available in room. I guess hotel has been renovated in recent years.The hotel is nicely located in walking distance between the Harrah's casino, river front/river mall, Saks Fifth Avenue  small mall attached to it, and - most importantly - the French Quarter. Well - nothing is perfect, though. It is NOT the right place if you come by car! No parking in front of the door (only 2-3 space where you can stop for a moment to disembark your luggage) and absolutely no parking possible around the hotel, also no public parking lot around (there is one for 10$ per day expiring at 7am, no in-out-option - therefore worthless for overnight parking). Your only option is using the hotel's agreement with Valet Parking company, which is dangerously unreliable. I staid 6 nights in the hotel, so I gathered some statistical significance: Whenever I called for my car, I had to wait 20-30 minutes before I got it. But much worse than that, at one instance my car had been burrowed without my knowledge or consent by someone while at the Valet Parking and driven around for about 80-100 miles. I noticed this only because I found trash in the car and that the gas was nearly empty. Took me 2 1/2 hours to file a complain with Valet Parking and talk to the police. Missed my morning business. Settlement with Valet Parking is still pending. Furthermore, hotel charges 25$/night for Valet Parking, even though I understood when I inquired about it before, that it should be 20$. Conclusion: Nice hotel with good value for money. Recommended for comfortable budget travel for people who don't come with their own or rental car. Stay away from the hotel if you come by car. However, I have no idea if the other hotels in the area are any better with respect to parking. Inquire with any hotel you consider whether they use Valet Parking (apparently a nation wide company), if yes, stay away, or their own hotel-owned parking lot.Without the parking issue I would rate it above average maybe even excellent with respect to value for money.

<Content>Good Affordable Hotel close to attractions This is a small hotel but adequate for all business travelers as well as tourists. Just a half block off of Canal Street, it is only a block away from the Casino, two blocks from the river and the Auquarium/IMAX. Across Canal is the French Quarter so those venues are close at hand. Rooms are in very good shape, look very new and bathrooms are well appointed. Only complaint was the water noise when the neighbor was showering, but get that in many hotels. Free Internet access is in all rooms, but you do need to bring an ethernet cable. Wireless is available in the lobby and breakfast area where there is plenty of room. I would certainly chose to stay here again over other hotels I have used in New Orleans due to the well kept hotel and especially the great prices. Location is great for families or business people as it is just a block to several convention hotels.

<Content>Fine Stay in Best Western Hotel I read mixed reviews before booking this hotel, so I was a little nervous. But it was completely fine! Everything was clean and the hotel staff were very friendly. The valet took a while, but we expected that going into it. The breakfast was your standard continental breakfast, okay but nothing special. I wish I hadn't booked through Orbitz though. It would have been $20/night less if I booked directly through the hotel. But I would stay here again.

<Content>Stay somewhere else Very rude hotel staff; rooms were okay but maid service was horrible. They made the bed but didn't leave towels or coffee or soap. I had to call the front desk twice and finally went down there myself. Beds and pillows old and lumpy; do not stay in this hotel if you have allergies! Parking was $28 per day, valet only, and it took them 50 minutes to get our car. No bellmen so you have to find a cart and unload and load your car while being double-parked on the street.

<Content>Good Location, Good Rate, Okay Room I spent a lot of time researching rooms in NO. We had only one night to stay and I wanted to optimize our time there. BW St Christopher is located within walking distance to the FQ, Jackson Square and Riverwalk. Check in went smoothly; they allowed us to check in early, around 2pm. We left our rental car in the care of valet parking (for $28, which is the norm in NO. I knew about the charge ahead of time, so I wasn't shocked. The room rate was low enough to make the parking charge acceptable). Our room was an upper floor corner room with exposed brick and a unique shape. It had plenty of space for the 4 of us. The beds were double/fulls, not queens, but they were comfortable.The only drawback to the room was the carpet. It was horribly stained; like a huge sloe gin fizz exploded in several areas of the room. Large red stains were in several places around the room. My 7 year old was a bit freaked out because he thought the large red stain between his side of the bed and the wall was blood (I'm sure it wasn't because it was bright red.) I understand that it was most likely impossible to remove whatever red substance caused the stains, but it made me leary of walking barefoot; and a bit more apt to notice other small things that were less then up-to-par, for example, there were ashes in the toilet (non smoking room) when we arrived, etc. However, overall, the room was otherwise clean and acceptable.The hotel also has what they call a Full American breakfast. It was the standard hotel breakfast fare of pastries and coffee, with the addition of waffles (but no syrup that we could find), packets of oatmeal and grits that you could microwave, hard boiled eggs and a cheese cube tray. Again, for the price, it was very acceptable. The valet returned our car to us in the morning in about 20 minutes after we asked (they say it takes 15). So, overall, I would recommend this hotel because of the good rate (in the mid 60s). If the rate was higher, I'd probably look for a little nicer place to stay, but at the rate we had, the place was an acceptable value.

<Content>You people are crazy if you hated it!  THe best western st christopher was a great value, far superior to most best westerns around the country, and i know its always where my company puts me up. The rooms are average size, and some have nice jacuzzis in them, downside is if you get a jacuzzi you get a mirror instead of a window. IF you get a window you get no jacuzzi, so pick your preference!The people who slam this place need to take a good hard look at themselves and their expectations of hotels. This place kicks butt compared to most hotels in new orleans that arent over 150 dollars. My room was very clean, and the toiletries were nice. The staff wasnt the friendliest, but come on who is at 2am with drunk people waling in??? THe location is EXCELENT!Most importantly the bed was comfortable. The lighting was ok and the amount of mirrors were great. Ice machines ar eonly on every OTHER floor though, so no running to the machine in a robe if your on an even floor. haha! I liked the 100 year old brick also. I will definatly stay here again.PS: IT IS NEXT DOOR TO HARRAHS SO PARK AT THE HARRAS GARAGE, AND PLAY FOR 30 MINUTES AND ITS FREE PARKING...JUST SOME HELPFUL ADVICE.

<Content>Clean, quiet hotel I live in New Orleans and when my family visited during the first week of April, they stayed at this hotel. It fit within their budget and location requirements. The FQ is across the street; Riverwalk is just a few blocks away. It was clean, quiet, and the staff was helpful. The parking situation isn't ideal (your car goes over to the Sheraton garage). The rooms had above average sized bathrooms and the rooms were cleaned every day.I would definitely recommend this hotel to people. It may not have all the New Orleans charm as other hotels, but it's a great deal.

<Content>It depends on how picky you are... If location is your biggest criteria, then this hotel is hard to beat. It is right off Canal Street with everytthing close by. We chose it because it was within walking distance to the Julia Street Cruise Terminal (12-15 minutes walk/8 easy blocks) if you don't have too much luggage. The French Quarter is across the street.Bourbon Street is three blocks away Harrah's casino is three blocks away.Jackson Square is four blocks away.The Convention center is 9 blocks away.Riverwalk Mall is 4 blocks away.Price was the second draw - about 100 a night - a great price for that area. Now, for the hotel itself. The Lobby/Reception desk is quite upscale - you feel like you are in a nice hotel. Beyond it is a breakfast area (free continental style breakfast) - also well kept and clean. The usual fare is offered in the morning: Bagels, toast, juice, muffins, cereal, coffee, etc.Even the hallways and elevators looked clean and classy. Then we got to our room... Not bad, but not quite 3 stars. The carpets were stained and had gum stuck to them - something you would think the hotel staff would have addressed. Now, granted, it was less than a month after Marti Gras - who knows what kind of partying took place in this room (and the party was still going on when we visited Bourbon Street that evening....not the most attractive part of New Orleans), but come on, take a knife and an ice cube and get the gum out of the carpet! That was the worst of it. The double beds were clean and fine, as were the washrooms. Tub cold use some caulking, but for the most part it was a two and one half star room.I'd stay there again. For the price, it was a great way to make sure our plane flight didn't make us miss our cruise.

<Content>Not the nicest Best Western This is not a New hotel by any means of the word. It is old and dirty. I will admit I have a high expectation from hotels and was completely disappointed to the point I tried to find another one during this stay. My room was tiny. There is no shelf space in the bathroom. I had to set up the ironing board in the bathroom in order to get ready each day. The curtains were soiled. The bedspread was soiled. The carpet was soiled. It was just dirty and smelled. It was so bad I ran to the local Wal-Greens to get a plug in to endure it. It is minimally staffed and they are not very helpful. It does have wifi but only in the lobby which was misleading. It does have a decent complimentary breakfast and eating area. No onsite restaurant but Rosey's is just a few steps away. It is also just 30 steps from Canal street and a block from the Sheraton. Unless you just need a place to change clothes and not actually rest, I would not stay here. If you just plan to play all night, it would be fine. However, I won't be going back!!

<Content>I Highly Recommend the St. Christopher! After the hurricane, I was a little apprehensive of picking a hotel in New Orleans that would not be surrounded by construction or would itself be under construction. I took a chance on the St. Christopher because it was within the location of our event. I could not be more pleased and appreciative of the staff, the location, the condition and style of the hotel, and of my over all experience. We needed help finding the hotel and the staff was so gracious in making sure we found the hotel. The staff was extremely helpful, nice, and professional. However, the only problem is the parking, you don't have to have valet but I would recommend it because it saves you leaving your car on the street. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a nice weekend getaway to New Orleans. We loved this place so much that we are returning to the same hotel, even though it is out of the way of our venue.

If this town just had a hurricane you would not know it by the staffing levels, service and condition of this wonderful hotel. Location is everything and this hotel has it.

<Content>Very satisfied We too stayed at the St. Christopher for JazzFest this year. I wouldn't want one of the rooms without a window. You'd better try to confirm your lodging arrangements for that. Unlike a couple of let down visitors, our stay was a nice as can be. We too arrived early, with car and went in to request luggage storage. We found all staff to be pleasant and efficient. Surprise - they had a room ready at 10 AM - oh so comforting. Twenty eight bucks a day for the car is a city thing.  The room was very satisfactory with a very comfortable bed and classy bathroom. We found the staff polite and helpful in all cases. Considering the post-Katrina status, we felt the room rate was very decent for New Orleans during the high-demand JazzFest period. We had no qualms about the breakfast being as advertised. You can eat plenty to offset the need for buying yet another city meal.  Certainly would stay here again. We feel they were doing a yeoman job considering the enormity of city problems during this period. We have stayed are various other places in N.O. over the years, some with definite limitations as conversions of 150 year old structures. A very nice experience so convenient yet removed from the hub-bub. Nice place (not utterly high end) and a respectable value.

<Content>Worst Hotel Experience We stayed at a great rated hotel called 鈥淭he Best Western Saint Christopher鈥?This had to be a great hotel named after the patron Saint of traveling. . . . . . . WRONG!!!First, we had two double beds in the room. The one that Jessica picked was OK, but the left over bed for us had a broken frame that rocked a little. This is not good for two people to sleep in. So we switchedThen Jessica pulled the bed spread back and got in the bed. She jumped out. The foot of the bed was wet. We pulled back the blanket and there was a 2 foot by 3 foot area of yellowish looking liquid that had saturated the blanket, top sheet, bottom sheet, and mattress. We called the front desk. They said they鈥檇 be right up. In the mean time more stuff happened.While waiting for the front desk, Barb turned down the roaring air conditioning fan running at high speed to a lower speed and it started CLANKING!!! like someone shoved a broom handle into a rotating fan blades.The front desk manager showed up with a change of sheets and blanket. We asked to be moved to another room. She refused, saying that they were all booked up. I didn鈥檛 believe her. Then we asked for a cot and she said that they were all out of cots. Again I didn鈥檛 believe her. Then she said she would take care of us in the morning (another lie) and left. . . . . . . . she left the sheets and blanket in the middle of the floor.So we stripped the bed, flipped the mattress so the wet side was down, made up the bed, turn the air conditioning fan up to HIGH and turned on the TV to drown out the roar.The next morning, I asked for our money back. The same girl from the night before said that she couldn鈥檛 do it as I had already pre paid thru Expdia.com (I thought I was going thru Hotel(-), but I guess Hotel.com is a front end for Expedia(-). She gave me a business card of the guest service manager to call on Monday. I just got off the phone with the Best Western Saint Christopher office phone and they told me that Cheryl Banks, the Guest Services Manager, doesn鈥檛 work for them anymore. No wonder. I wouldn鈥檛 want to work for a business that treats their guest this badly. I鈥檓 waiting for a return call from the General Manager, but from the sound of his voice on his answering machine he sounded like some 19 year old kid.So the lessons learn is:鈥on鈥檛 stay at Best Western鈥on鈥檛 book with Expdia(-)or Hotel(-)

<Content>Worst Western! We booked this hotel, including air, from Boston, for $575 for five nights during Jazz Fest, so it was quite a good deal. We have been to NOLA many times and paid more. This was by far the worst hotel in which we have stayed. Not sure if we got what we paid for or not. Arrived Thurs at 1:30pm. First impression was, a nice facility, and we already knew it was a great location. The desk person was surly, and informed us that check-in wasn't until 3pm (off to a flying start, but this is stated by the hotel listing). Another woman showed us where to leave our bags - in an unlocked room with other luggage. I freshened up a bit, added a hat, etc, and so was in there a good fifteen minutes unattended. Hmmm. Made sure my jewelry was in my carry-on satchel, and off we went. We were somewhat relieved that we knew exactly where to go to kill some time.We returned and kicked off our shoes. The room was really, really small, but nicely appointed. The saga continues. Noticed wet tacky spot (bare feet, mind you) in front of the armoire, and what appeared to be a dry yellow spot next to it 鈥?dog? Well, it's a pet hotel, and although this wasn't too appealing, we are pet owners, and let it go. What's a bit of dog protein? The wet spot took a couple of days to dry out, though.And the rest:Complementary breakfast was a bit Spartan. There is no room/food service at all, and is so noted in by the hotel.Friday's maid left no replacement coffee pack, but at least we knew someone had been there. Saw two maids, Sat  Sun. Sat's took the bath towels with a promise to return with new, and never came back. Sun's was very accommodating. Never saw one Monday. Fortunately, my roommate had the foresight to ask for more tp, coffee, etc, previously, or we would have run out.On Sat, my roommate somehow managed to reprogram the safe. Nothing we tried would open it, so she called the desk. After twenty minutes with no help, she went in search of. She found a maintenance man (lovely person, but spoke no English) who was clueless as to how to get into the safe, but he did head out to get a manager, who got it open. We wonder if we'd still be sitting there if someone hadn't gone looking.TV remote only worked consistently if you took the battery slide off the back. Cable channels were extremely limited, with lots of sports and news channels. Also, when you changed channels, the channel info and time stamps were wrong! So don't use that to check the time and station!Handle (screw-in type) fell off the cold water stem. We screwed it back in.Large water leak/stain on the hall carpet, covered with towels at one point. The Sunday maid had us checking out that day instead of Tuesday. When I checked out, there were two additional nights on the bill. I showed Ms. Surly (who was in a better mood that day) my confirmation, and she did take the charges off. And the best yet: I got flea bitten!!! On day three, it started. Just a few here and there, but enough itchy-burny to drive me nuts. My guess is, from the bed, although my travel partner didn't get bitten. I didn't figure it out until day four, and by that time, oh well, we are outta here tomorrow. I came home, dabbed tiger balm on the spots, blasted my luggage and all contents with non-toxic flea spray, and closed everything up. We did wonder about service levels in other hotels, post-Katrina; and we also kind of tolerated all this because we had such a cheap rate. That being said, I would still rename it, The Worst Western. We have decided that when next we go (and we will, New Orleanians really need us to come visit, and thanked us profusely for doing so; and this trip was basically seamless and lots of fun, nonetheless) 鈥?we will spend a bit more. Maybe the Chateua Sonesta again, that ruined us!

<Content>Great for college students on a budget!! My boyfriend and I were very satisfied with the hotel for the price we paid. The parking is a little steep, but the overall price was unbeatable. The hotel was very clean and modern. I was a little worried about being on Magazine street, but it was in a very safe and convienient location between the french quarter and the casino. i can't say enough about how clean and new the hotel was compared to some of the ones we have stayed in new orleans. I would definately recommend this to anyone staying in New Orleans on a budget!!!

<Content>a great place to crash A friend and I stayed at this hotel for 5 days in late May, 2005. We were not too sure about the area it being our first trip to NOLA. When we arrived the first day, the people were very nice and got us to our room quick. The hotel is small but clean and everything looked really new and nice. We had booked a room with 1 king bed but got one with 2 instead. The view was of a side street below but we didn't mind. The room was clean especially the bathroom which is always a must in my opinion! Overall, we had a great stay. it wasn't too far to walk to everything. Bourbon was a solid 10 minutes but not too bad if you had too much to drink. We found plenty to do nearby as well (Canal Place, RiverWalk). The breakfast is standard complimentary you'll find anywhere. The only problem we had was that our remote was broken and it didn't bother us enough to tell anyone so it didn't matter much. Although some say don't head to Hueys 24/7 diner next door. We had a late breakfast there and the food was decent but a lil overpriced. It was good to know it was right there if we needed it and they also do the room service @ the hotel, we never tried it though.

<Content>Loved this hotel! This is a great hotel in a great location. The room was very spacious and modern with all the amenities and the staff (especially Wade and Kanisha) at the front desk could not do enough for us. The housekeeping staff was very efficient and friendly. Every morning, we had an expanded continental breakfast and there was coffee, tea, and fresh fruit (apples and bananas) all the time. It's only 1 block from the Harrah's Casino and the waterfront with all the Riverwalk shops and 2 blocks from the main French Quarter. Best of all is the price - $59.00 per night! You cannot do better at any price! A great hotel in a great city!

<Content>Just So So I've stayed in a few places in NO and this was my least favorite. There are better places out there with better deals if you look for them. Location isn't bad and rooms are decent. That's about it. Staff if not courteous at all. Valet Parking takes forever. Breakfast in the morning isn't worth going to. The selection is very poor and they don't keep it stocked well (one morning they had food but no plates). With the selection out there, choose something else.

<Content>Nice Digs! My spouse and I stayed at the BWSC and found it to be very nice. Clean, safe, courteous, etc. Met or exceeded expectations to the degree that I've changed to this location from a previously booked hotel for an upcoming business trip. Staff was top notch.Room size was cozy and the breakfast buffett could be beefed up a bit, but those are nits. Hey, I'm going back!

<Content>great value We stayed at the St. Christopher 3/20-23/05 and found it to be a great deal at 59.00 plus tax. The parking was additional (28), but it was still okay. Our car was brought to us (they use a parking garage around the corner) within 20 minutes. Very nice room and the staff was excellent. Breakfast was included and was more than sufficient. My only wish would have been to have a frig. and microwave in the room, but the breakfast room did have one (microwave) you could use, and hot water and coffee were always available. Its located one block off Canal and so close to everything. We would definately go again. For our price it can't be beat.

<Content>Nice, clean, comfortable stay and close to everything Never having visited New Orleans we weren't exactly sure where this hotel was in relation to everything we wanted to do and worried it might not be in the safest location. We only paid $69 a night. It was right on the corner of Canal and Magazine, which is directly across from the French Quarter. The trolley cars stop right in front of the hotel on Canal. We never ventured the opposite way into the Central Business District so I can't say what is in that direction. The lobby, corridors and rooms looked brand new. The room was cozy with exposed bricks and large wooden beams. We had a king size bed. The furnishings were beautiful in the room and throughout the hotel. Nice bathrooms with stone tiled floors. Not much shelf space in the bathroom so try and bring something to hang on the back of the door to hold bathroom items. Housekeeping did a good job. The carpet in our room looked like it had a wine stain, a remnant of a Mardi Gras party no doubt. Continental breakfast is included and is standard fare with muffins and bagels. The coffee was very weak every day and I had to go to the diner next door to get a cup of coffee in the morning. Staff was friendly and helpful. We arrived at 11 a.m. and while we could not check in until 3 p.m. they held our luggage and gave us a claim ticket so we could pick it up later. I had read on this website that someone had a room without a window and afraid the same thing would happen to us. I confirmed when we arrived that morning that our room would have a window.

<Content>Great place to stay! Everyone at the St. Christopher was very nice and our room was always spotless. The only complaint is that room service starts at 8 am! We had a great room on the 8th floor that overlooked the water and we could see Sak's Fifth Ave. and all of the ships going by. It was very peaceful. We were there from 2/23/05 - 2/27/05. The people at the front desk were wonderful and always helpful even on the weekend when it was PACKED with people trying to make reservations. I would definately stay here again since it has the best location of most of the hotels. It is just a quick walk up Canal and you're at the French quarter and Bourbon St. It was very quiet yet so close to everything! Definately try the 24 hour restaurant right next door.

<Content>Great location, mediocre hotel We got a great TravelZoo deal---$59 a night. It was definitely worth that, but had we paid a higher price, we would have been disappointed. As others have noted, housekeeping was not up to snuff. We had no towels on arrival and one blood-stained sheet. The window sills had bandaid debris and toothpicks. The coffee area was not cleaned or restocked once during our three day stay, and our bath mat and washcloths were removed and not replaced. The front desk staff were not particularly helpful, especially when we were leaving and needed a cab; they sent our cab off with somebody else and then insisted the driver would be back in time to take us to the airport. (He wasn't.) On the other hand, the rooms are reasonably spacious and attractive, and the location is fantastic.

<Content>Great location, good value Stayed at the hotel 2/27-3/4/05- Great location- close to EVERYTHING- One block to Harrah's Casino (stop in- it is VAST). Two blocks to the waterfront- Right off Canal Street- An easy walk into the Quarter. Check the usual websites for good pricing- An adequate breakfast is offered daily- Cold cereals, instant oatmeal, juice, muffins, bagels, waffles, etc. Saves some money for the gourmet places N.O. is famous for- We had a king bed- room was on the 10th floor with a view towards the river. Very nice- Clean- the room pictured on the hotel website is dead on to what we had. Staff was friendly- though we didn't have much interaction with them since everything was taken care of without asking. Definitely recommended if you can get good pricing- Not glitzy, but VERY adequate.. P.S. Skip Huey's directly across the street and, in our opinion, skip Mother's around the corner..
