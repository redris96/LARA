<Content>convenient, cheap, but...bedbugs! my partner  i wanted a cheap place to stay during a conference - we refused to pay over $100 for some fancy pants hotel. the Astoria Hotel was decent enough: cheap, convenient location, friendly staff. i'd second what the other reviewers have said, the staff is nice, but not overly friendly or helpful. we were promised an iron. our room didn't have one, but we were able to get one from the front desk. our room was ridiculously tiny, but we didn't care b/c we just wanted somewhere to eat, shower, and sleep.BUT...we found a beetle-ish bug on our bed one night  then (after we left the hotel) i noticed that i had several bites. i didn't know what a bedbug was, so i looked it up when i got home  sure enough, the bug we saw on our linens was a bedbug  the bites i had were bedbug bites. i don't think they're exactly infested - we didn't find any other bugs - but i do have several bites. contacted the hotel, but the staff wasn't very responsive (back to that not overly friendly/helpful business).

<Content>Go but don't expect customer service My boyfriend and I stayed here for four nights as we were celebrating our annaversary in San Fran. I originaly wanted a much nicer more romantic hotel but my boyfriend convinced me that if we weren't spending 200 a night on hotels we could stay a few extra days and do more. That being said I'd read previous reviews for Hotel Astoria and wasen't expecting much in the way of ambeince, just some where to sleep and take a shower, that was centrally located. Check in was fast but on their website there is an option to requeste a room with a microwave and refridgerator (which I did) and was told at check in that this wasen't possible. When I showed him my printed out comfirmation he said that he could get me the refridgerator but not the microwave. I said that was fine and we left for the day.  Later that evening when we returned, our room did not have a refridgerator. When I went to the front desk to ask what the problem was there was a different guy working and he told me there was no way he could get me one and they hadn't had them for three years! (I wasen't really upset about the lack of refridgerators just the fact that I was promised one and didn't get it, and they didn't try to make up for it or anything. Didn't even apologize) The rooms were clean but very small and there wasen't many chanels on the t.v. but enough for my boyfriend to watch the games he wanted. The bed was pretty uncomfortable and if you are a light sleeper I wouldn't recommend here as we were on the 6th floor and could still hear entire conversations of people on the ground at night and car alarms and police sirens. . . .  In all fairness the hotel wasen't great but if your planning not to be there all day and just looking for a place to sleep with absolutely no ammenties or customer service then sure stay here, the price is right. But if you even want to ask for directions or recommendations for a good resturaunt or have the front desk call a cab for you forget it. My boyfriend is a no-frills Navy guy and even he said he wished we would have spent a little more money and stayed some place nicer.

<Content>This place is bad! The location is great, right near Chinatown, and centrally located. BUT, this place is awful. The shower curtains had black mould on them, the tub looked like it hadn't had a decent cleaning in years, and the furniture in the room was pretty dilapitated. I haven't stayed in place as poor as this for a loooong time. But it was the weekend, and everything else that we could afford was full. Breakfast is included, muffins, juice, coffee, etc. but all in a small room with a long table that everyone shares. This whole place really took me back to visits I had made to China many years ago.

<Content>Very Basic, But Clean Hotel - Great Location My husband and I stayed at the Astoria Hotel this past weekend because we're tightening our belts with the credit crunch and we didn't want to spend $000's a night on accommodation.In a nutshell, the Astoria is basic, but its also clean and the location is GREAT 鈥?about a 5 minute stroll from Montgomery BART station (ideal if you鈥檙e flying in to SFO for the w鈥檈nd 鈥?a return fare is only $11), its right on the edge of Chinatown, Fishermans Wharf (where you get the Alcatraz Ferry  can hire bikes to cycle to the Golden Gate bridge) is just a 25 minute leisurely stroll away through Chinatown and Little Italy, and Union Square (shopping central) is about 3 blocks.Our room was a decent size, but it was shabby 鈥?the d茅cor was tired and a bit grubby, and the furniture was old fashioned. Having said that, the sheets were nice and clean and the towels smelt lovely 鈥?all still a nice bright white so they鈥檝e obviously been looked after and cleaned properly. I only have 1 real gripe to do with hygiene and that鈥檚 basically because the hotel didn鈥檛 use fitted bottom sheets on the bed, and so my skin came into contact with the mattress where I鈥檇 tossed and turned in the night. Therefore, although the sheets were lovely and fresh, the mattress was not up to exactly the same standard simply because by very nature it can鈥檛 be washed every time someone sleeps on it鈥?(However, it did have a mattress protector on it, it didn鈥檛 smell bad or anything, but i want to paint a true picture)On a positive note, the breakfast that was included with our room was great and set us up until lunch time. It comprised good quality bagels and muffins, with jam or cream cheese plus orange juice and coffee. Watch out for the 鈥榖reakfast police鈥?though. I鈥檇 happily polished off a tasty cheese bagel and decided to head back to the room with a muffin so I could finish getting ready whilst watching the news. The staff lady overseeing breakfast ordered me not to take the muffin away and told me I had to eat it in the breakfast room. She wouldn鈥檛 explain why and just looked really cross. Obviously I just sneaked the damn thing out in my bag anyway, (what is the big deal?) but be careful not to get caught else you鈥檒l suffer the wrath!There was a safe in our room which is great peace of mind if you have lots of cash or valuables, and the maid left us fresh towels, shampoo and soap everyday when we had the 鈥榙o not disturb鈥?sign on our door. There was also plenty of hot water. Mind you, you might want to take a hairdryer (I did) if you normally require one, and maybe some ear plugs - on the weekday that we stayed it was very noisy outside from around 8am caused by nearby building work. Although the weekend was fine and it was easy to sleep without them. I would probably stay at the Astoria Hotel again because it is cheap, its clean and the location was fab. My only gripe like I said, was the issue with the mattress 鈥?but no reports of bed bugs from anyone else, so am hoping I鈥檒l be ok!!

<Content>Fantastic location and very clean We stayed at Astoria from the 9th September for four nights. The location of the hotel is excellent, right by chinatown, the shops and not too far from the waterfront.The hotel is basic, don't expect luxury, but it exceeded my expectations. The double room was average size with a new bathroom attached. The room was very clean and we had housekeeping and fresh towels every day.The breakfast is simple, but sufficient with toast, bagels, muffins, juice and coffee. The breakfast room can get busy, but we always had somewhere to sit.The reception staff were helpful and always answered our queries as best they could.They don't have their own parking, b ut they do a good deal with a nearby car park, where you can park for 24 hours for $22. I would stay here again if I visit San Francisco as it was well worth the money.

<Content>Fantastic Downtown hotel at great prices Stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend a few weeks ago, at the start of a 3 week trip around California. I would have to say that the hotel is a fantastic place to stay for anyone on a budget - it is 2 blocks from Union Square (approx 3 mins walk), has a decent breakfast (Bagels, cheese, muffins etc.) and really friendly staff. Don't go expecting luxury, but clean, relatively spacious with good storage and a great shower! Would recommend this place to anyone and would definitely go back again!

<Content>Our trip to HELL The hotel Is in a great location. That is about it. I wouldn't let my worst enemy's stay there. While in the room, It felt as if I was in a sweat shop housing area. It was dirty and gross.I sleep with a CPAP machine. well One of the nights I was awoken in the middle of the night Choking and gasping for air.the power had gone out. well that one incident wasn't the only on. it was on and off for the rest of the night and the morning. When I asked about the power and told them about how I sleep, No apology, No reassurance that the power wasn't going to go out again, Nothing. I called the day before we would arrive and asked about parking and the front of the hotel and the guy I talked to assured me the hotel had a pull in where we could pull the car into so we would be off the street. well we pulled up to the hotel and that wasn't true. NO PULL IN we had to park in the street and unload the car, after we checked in we had to drive three blocks away to a parking garage to park. I didn't mind that, But what I didn't understand was why drive three blocks when there is a parking Garage right across the street. Guess its true you get what you pay for.plus a few more problems ,It was a weekend that my wife and I will look back on in thirty year an say what were we thinking about staying at that hotel. It was an adventure for the both of use. One thing is for sure We Will NEVER stay in this hotel again.

<Content>more for your money We arrived at hotel Astoria two hours before check in time and were allowed to check in early. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful the entire four days we were there. It was easy to find from the Bart station, right at the entrance to Chinatown and Starbucks right across the street. We had a corner room with a nice view and it was quiet. The beds were comfortable and the shower was good. It's a great place to stay if you want value and convenience, especially since we were just there for a bed and hot shower. When we left on the last day, the front desk kept our luggage until we returned for it to leave for the airport. Overall this is a great experience if you don't expect amenities.

<Content>Horrible stay in Astoria The Astoria is the the absolute pits as far as hotels go. I have stayed all over the country, in a variety of hotels and hostels, and there is no way I would recommend this place.Besides being extremely old and run down, the rooms have no clocks, no telephones, and the windows rattle all night. When I asked if I could have a clock, I was told: wake up call. When I explained that I wanted to see what time it was, he responded wake up call!The so-called continental breakfast is horrible, and the attendant blocked the door when I tried to take a cup of coffee and a muffin to my room. No food in room! he yelled.I am not a picky traveler, but this hotel was beyond my limits. The staff acted like they were doing me a big favor by letting me stay there. Do yourself a favor and avoid the Astoria!

<Content>Bitter-sweet to a tee. My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel during our trip to San Francisco. First of all, we had some trouble finding it due to all the one way streets. We passed it a few times before we even realized where it was. It's not very noticable from the street, either. The woman that checked us in sounded like she had much better things to do than deal with us, so she kept her information and directions very brief. When she wasn't helping guests, she was on her cell phone, talking VERY loudly. When a guest would come up to ask her a question, she would remain on the phone and point her finger in some random direction. Not very helpful, as you can imagine...The elevator is SCARY. It smells like mold and shook a few times before it would finally stop. It also only has a maximum weight of 3 persons. Our room was nothing like the pictures on the website, either. It was so small, we could barely get around without running into eachother, stepping on something, running into a piece of furniture, etc. The bed squeaked ALOT. Although there was free Wi-Fi, it doesn't work if your too far away from the 2nd floor. Breakfast is a little... skimpy. But still sufficient. Now for the GOOD news: The location was AWESOME. It's literally right next door to the gates of Chinatown, 4 blocks from Market St., and generally in the middle of the ritzy district. There was one man who worked there who was EXTREMELY helpful. He answered all of our questions and was very polite.

<Content>Good location - otherwise horrible I got the hotel because it was in a good location and the reviews looked plausibly ok, however I was very dissapointed. It was in a good location, right next to Chinatown, but it should not be called a hotel, but a cheap motel or a hovel. The room may have been cleaned before we got there, but it was so old that you couldn't tell for sure. Furniture, carpet, bathroom all in horrible condition. Even though it was cheap ~$75/night, it really wasn't worth it.

<Content>A short enjoyable stay Stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend for two nights. The hotel is very basic, but we were in San Francisco to see the city, not the hotel.The room was small but clean overlooking the street and we had a great view. The elevator scared me a little, but it seemed to work for most people who aren't as claustrophobic as I am. As I didn't like the elevator I walked to the seventh floor everytime we walked in or out. At least we got our daily work out! ;)The staff was curteous and checked us in without a problem.The breakfast consisted of bagels and cream cheese basically. Coffee was available as well. A budget hotel I'd definitely recommend for someone on a budget who wants to have everything within walking distance.

<Content>RUN anywhere else! I may not have enough english words to describe how AWFUL this place was. First thing it SMELLS like you don't want to know what. The room was CRAPPY, walls dirty, uncomfy mattress, paper linens, destroyed furniture... Just to say that. Plus, no towels change! I walked to the front desk, asking for new ones. The guy there asked me : Are they REALLY dirty?. We paid about 85$/ night. You can book a *** or more for 100$ through hotwire or discount websites. Just never stay there!

<Content>Basic but great values I have stayed here twice now, July 2006 and June 2008, and it was much the same each time. On the plus side, the location is great and central, the rates are surprisingly low in what is normally an expensive town, and breakfast is included in most quoted rates. It's not luxurious, and the staff are polite without being overly warm. On the down side, it can be a bit noisy at night (because of the location), the fittings etc are clean but rather threadbare, and the breakfast is minimalist.So, if you're looking for value and a great central location, this place is for you. You can spend your money seeing the sights or enjoying SF's many restaurants etc, rather than handing it over to a pricier hotel. If you want an indulgent experience where the hotel itself rather than the city  surrounds is the focus, then look elsewhere.

<Content>poor Booked this hotel mainly because of the price and location. Stayed here for 3 nights in late may.The hotel is right next to China Town and thus easy to get to, there are afew local stores close-hand too so you can pretty much get anything you need toBut the hotel is very old inside; the room was tiny and did smell fusty. It was clean though. The staff on the reception didn鈥檛 really want to chat at all, but did help if you needed it.The hotel is cheap compared to most in the area but i would advise you to look at somewhere else unless you are on a very limited budget.

<Content>Great little place! I LOVED this hotel. It was small and old with tons of character. If you're looking for four-star and fancy-shcmancy, this is NOT the place for you. But it you want to enjoy San Francisco in an old place with lots of character and a great, friendly staff, this IS the place for you! Not only was it incredibly cheap for the location (our room overlooked Chinatown at Grant Ave), we got there before our check-in time and our room was ready. They also held our bags for us after check-out so we didn't have to carry them around all day. The down side is that it's a bit noisy at night, but this is to be expected in the middle of a big city! The room was also pretty small and basic. But if you're there for the city and not the room, this place is just perfect. I absolutely recommend it and will definitely go there again.

<Content>You get what you pay for. Great place I did my research and read all the reviews on this place including the one below and bit the bullet and booked it (it seemed everything else available was 4x the price). The location is great. It took a lazy 25 min to walk to pier 33 for alcatraz, 20 min to coit tower and really is central for anything. Yes the decor isnt great but who cares!. I stayed in a room with queen bed, bathroom. Yes there was a paper bath mat. So what? And yes the tv was a bit dodgy. That is until i re programmed it with the remote and got another 30 channels :) Breakfast consists of bagels, muffins, orange juice and coffee. A little tip to avoid the queue at the toasters. Breakfast starts at 8 am until 9.30 am. I went down each time at 10 to 8 and there is no one. All in all its awesome value for location and the rooms are fine! Its not 5star but i knew that going in. It exceeded my expectations. Also if you are doing the alcatraz tour, do the early bird first tour of the day at 9am. After you get off the boat at Alcatraz and listen to the ranger, skip the movie and go straight up to the audio tour. Being a keen photographer, most of my photos have no one in them!. Its like i had the place to myself for about 30 min. (Then the crowds turn up ) It was great to walk around the cells with only a handful of people. When i left 2 hours later, the place was teeming with people.

<Content>I would rather stay at a roach motel If you consider Satellite TV to be an antenna on the hotel roof, a hair drier to be a towel and internet access to mean being able to occasionally reach somewhere else's wifi and logging in once every 4 days, then this hotel did NOT lie on their Orbitz hotel listing.But if you actually take a listing at its word, then you will start being exceptionally disappointed. Your sadness will grow as you discover this hotel's elevator is completely destroyed (with the door off and gears jammed with a mere rope of yellow caution tape keeping out any children brave enough to explore). Or when you realize your room only has one tiny mirror in the bathroom and no others in the room. Or when you notice the lack of an alarm clock. Perhaps the vacancy of a hotel ice machine will be the last straw for you, or maybe it will be the paper thin walls, or the staff's refusal to let you use their microwave.Whatever you're looking for in a hotel, this place does NOT have it, that can be certain.This panning review does not come from someone accustomed to 5 star hotels with saunas and free concierge, but from someone who could quickly point out 5 roach motels that are better than this nightmare.Yes, the location is good, no, nothing else here is. Save your money and sleep somewhere else.

<Content>Can't beat the room rates! We stayed in this hotel for 5 days last summer, and all in all, it was an enjoyable experience.The hotel is located at the gate to Chinatown and close to the financial district. Staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful. At first, we didn't get the room (2 single beds) we had booked, but it got changed straight away when we complained. In the first room a strange monotonous noise could be heard, but the second room was absolutely fine. In the room, we had a telephone and a small TV. It was clean, just like the bathroom, even if you can't really call them modern. In the whole hotel there's a slight smell of ... well, I don't really know what, but it's not disturbing. Breakfast contains mainly of toasted bread, bagels and big muffins and is good if you're not too picky. The room it is served in is not too accommodating, however, but it's still ok.What's really unbeatable about this hotel are the room rates. I doubt that you get a hotel cheaper than the Astoria in San Francisco, and considering that, it's more than recommendable if you don't want to spend to much money and still feel comfortable.

<Content>Quirky but good value My husband and I were in San Francisco at the beginning and end of a 7 week trip to US and Canada. We booked the Astoria from Australia via the hotel website. As it was only 1 star and we had read previous reviews on Tripadvisor we weren't expecting the Hilton. We found it a fun place to stay with a great location. It is cheap, clean and in the centre of the city -hard to beat. The breakfast is very basic but the hotel so cheap that breakfast in one of the nearby diners won't break the bank. We booked to stay on our way home on the basis of the first stay.On the downside the towels seem to repel water rather than absorb it and there is no TV or tea/coffeee making facilities in the room. On the good side who needs TV when the whole of San Francisco is on your doorstep and the desk staff could not have been more helpful. Nancy on the front desk went out of her way to find information for us, recommended restaurants etc.If you want all the creature comforts then this is not for you -don't stay at any 1 star hotel but for cheap, clean accomodation in agood location this one is hard to beat.

<Content>Staff is rude, irritable, anti-helpful, misleading... Stay elsewhere Hotel is old and well-used, but tolerably clean. Small rooms, large closets, absolutely no amenities.SLEPT ON FLOOR!!Staff = rude, irritable, anti-helpful, misleading...Three-night trip was for business, as such my colleagues and I knew we would be spending almost zero time in the hotel room. Our goal was to find an affordable hotel, just comfortable enough for sleeping and storing our clothes. Even with such minimalist expectations, we were horribly disappointed with the Astoria.With 3 of us travelling together, we asked repeatedly when booking and when the first person checked-in if the room would suffice for three people (booking was for two beds + rollaway). As the last to arrive, I sadly discovered that the hotel does not even own a rollaway and the room wound up being too small for a rollaway to even fit. The desk manager was excessively rude. He insisted that one of his staff had lied to us (his words), wanted us to figure out which of his staff that was, and said he couldn't/wouldn't do anything to fix the problem beyond giving us a spare blanket so one of us could SLEEP ON THE CLOSET FLOOR. Our subsequent requests for a solution (any solution) degraded into the manager becoming insulting. At one point, my colleague phoned downstairs to ask the manager again for help. Manager called her boring and hung up on her.Regardless of how many pennies you save, this hotel just ain't worth it. There are other conveniently located hotels for a similar price and better courtesy.

<Content>Excellent location, decent hotel The location is the best feature of the hotel. Its at the Chinatown gates and walking distance to many restaurants, shops, and tourist attractions. It feels very safe walking there at night, and the hotel is walking distance to public transportation. The hotel itself is old and a little run down. The furniture is a little dated, but everything seemed clean. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of heat and hot water. The breakfast was the standard continental breakfast and was restocked constantly so nothing ever ran out. The staff was very nice and helpful with giving directions, offering advice on good restaurants, etc. I would definitely stay here again. You just can't beat this location and deal.

<Content>I recommed it Safe, clean, friendly staff. And the location! Unless you expect luxury, you'll be happy with the hotel. No iron or hair dryer in the room, but you can get one from the reception. The old building has character, which will be appreciated by people who are tired with chain hotels. I had a great wiev on the city from my room on the 5th floor (I don't know if this is true for all rooms on this floor). It can be a bit loud (traffic) in the morning and evening (not so much at night), so take ear plugs if you are sensitive to noise. I booked it through the hotel website, they claim it's the cheapest way. Overall very good hotel experience.

<Content>Does the job I agree with the previous reviews on this place. . . . its nothing special, but hey its about $70 a night!To me, it was a place to stay for opne night that was clean and the location right at the entrance to chinatown is great. Slap bang in the middle of the action, and only a couple of blocks from Union Square. You also get pastries, muffins  coffee in the breakfast room which is included in the price.My Girlfriend wasn't too happy with it but she's a clean freak with high standards! Some of the people working on the front desk weren't too helpful ether, but we were only there for a night so it wasn't really an issue.All in all, great location, good value for money. .. . but for me its only a place I would stay for one or two nights for a bed and a shower.Sure if you don't mind where you stay you could stay for longer if you on on a real budget, it would suffice.

<Content>Clean Budget Hotel We stayed there one night. It's no palace but it's clean and cheap and it's in a great location near everything and literally down the block from the Chinatown gateway. Perfect if you're stopping over for 1 night or in town and really just need a place to rest your head and take a shower. As long as you manage your expectations for what you are going to get at this price this place is a great bargain.

<Content>Safe and clean in an ideal location This hotel has the feel of a college dorm rather than a hotel, but the rooms were cheap and clean, felt reasonably safe, and the location is perfect. It is close to everything. We had a room facing the street and there was a lot of city noise, so bring ear plugs if you're sensitive to that. I would definitely recommend this hotel if all you're planning to do is sleep and shower there. That was all we used it for and it was absolutely ideal.

<Content>Great location and good for the money My wife and I and some friends from England, were just staying here a few nights. We were looking for something inexpensive, close to China Town, but within the hussle and bussle of the city. We all thought the staff were very friendly and accommodating to our needs. The rooms were very clean and being from the hotel/resort industry, housekeeping is a major concern to me. It was excellent. The decor and furniture was old, but clean.  Don't confuse the two of them.The beds were very very noisy, everytime you turned over the whole bed squeeked, we ended up just laughing so much it became amusing. I aksed the front desk if we could move on the second night and he did everything he could, unfortunately they were booked, but he tried.As we walked the streets at night in search of restaurants and bars we felt very safe and not intimidated by any means.The restaurants seemed to close early for food, which we found to be a problem and not many bars to enjoy a drink late at night. There were a few wine bars and they were expensive, I just needed a bar. There is a local Irish bar just around the corner from the hotel with a great atmosphere, check it out..I would have no problems staying there again if I ever returned to SFTip: Make sure you do Alcatraz, I did not have any interest of doing the trip before I left home, but once persuaded and got to the island, i was amazed. Get the audio tour that you complete by yourself,, trust me you will enjoy every second being there.G

<Content>A budget hotel true to it's name Before staying at Hotel Astoria, decide what your needs are--if you're looking for luxury and excellent service, this is not the place for you. If you're looking for an extremely cheap, clean place to sleep and keep your stuff while sightseeing, it's a good choice.Pros: Room was very clean, housekeeping did an immaculate job in the bathroom each day, we paid about $69/night plus tax(book directly on the hotel's website), location was excellent (next to Chinatown, across from a parking garage, near plenty of cafes and shops, easy walk to the Montgomery BART/muni), large window with a spectacular view in room 703, quiet hotel.Cons: Rooms are old, with a smell that takes a little getting used to (akin to my great-grandmother's house when she became less mobile and had a large dog...we kept the window open and it was fine), hotel staff is generally not service-oriented and can be rude, the continental breakfast is worth skipping (get some buns and tea in Chinatown instead).

<Content>brill location, basic but clean room the astoria has a fantastic location, right next to the gate to China town and only a 5 to 10 minute walk to union square, and the location cannot be beaten for the price. the rooms are basic, and a bit dated, but clean, good shower, TV, etc. breakfast in a communal kitchen room with HUGE muffins, and unlimited toast, OJ, coffee, tea and muffins that will definitely fill you up for the day. if you are looking for a cheap stay in the centre of san fran and you arent looking for luxury then stay here!

<Content>Fantastic location, great hotel My advise to anyone on a limited budget - or anyone who would rather spend their cash on sightseeing and eating out in this wonderful city should definetly consider staying at Hotel Astoria.The check in was fast and easy, the counter staff were helpful and polite. We checked into our room which although basic and the decor a little tired, was clean and quiet with a great powerful shower and a safe.The breakfast was included in the exceptionally resonable room rates and was more than enough to keep you going until lunch. There are HUGE muffins and bagels - lots of different flavours, bread to make yourself toast and fresh orange juice, coffee and tea. I really dont know why anyone complains about it! We thought it was great.The best thing about this hotel is the location - for the price it is brilliant. Right near the shops, union sqaure, chinatown. Everywhere downtown is easily within walking distance. Its also on the main road and felt completely safe - always people around. There is also a very handy corner store accross the road if you need any fruit/water/beer etc.Stay at the Astoria - its great!To all the people who are worried by the complaints on this hotel - if you are sensible (like we were!) you take in consideration the price you pay for the type of hotel you get. You wouldn't expect to pay for a McDonalds and get a 5 star silver service meal would you?! Clare  Mike - Manchester, England UK

<Content>Needs complete remodelling We stayed here for 10 nights and never again. First night we were on 4th floor, carpets and chair are full of stains, furniture looks like it was picked from a trash and the worst part was mattress. It was old and squeaky, I could feel the springs poking me and next morning I couldn't feel my back. Lady at reception was nice and gave us 3 other rooms to check, every one of them different, so we chose one on 6th floor which had decent mattress. Furniture was in same condition, filthy carpets, funky smell, but much better then previous one. Remote control is tied to the night table, which is totally weird. Maids don't speak English at all, they were only changing sheets if we asked them and they needed assistance from reception with translation. Bed cover is so old it looks filthy, bathrooms were clean and yes, you do get breakfast. You need voucher from front desk and you can not take breakfast to your room. There's a kitchen lady watching you like a hawk and I was there when gentleman came and asked her if he could take it to his room since he doesn't feel well and she made him eat his breakfast in the kitchen. You get same selection of bagels, muffins, cream cheese, butter, jam, orange juice, milk and coffee every morning, so I took advantage of it only couple times. Location is good if you like seeing fellow tourist snapping pictures of Chinatown gate non stop. I didn't mind the outside noise, Starbucks is right across the street with the same 2 homeless guys sitting in front, so you can not sit outside and drink your coffee. Please check Jasmine's place which is up the Bush street on left side. They have excellent coffee and great breakfast for 2.79$ (2 eggs, toast and coffee). There's bunch of little, quaint hotels up the street and I wish they had availability. Luckily for us, we were outside most of the time, so we only spent time in room to sleep. Hotel is cheap and if you stay here for night or two, I guess it's ok, but for longer stay, look elsewhere. We had to buy air freshener to get rid of the smell. Elevator is terrible, slow, only 3 people at the time and housekeeping is using it as well. You will get one key to the room and it's the actual key. This hotel has great potential and with remodeling and it's location it would be so much better. Considering that it's pretty much in the middle of everything it's such a shame that's in a rang of Motel 6, if not worse.

<Content>OK hotel, Great Location This is a 2 star hotel (maybe??) with an excellent location. The rooms are on the shabby side - old paint, outdated upholstery, chipped furniture. But the location cannot be beat - steps from the entrance to Chinatown and a short walk to Union Square. And while the room was on the shabby side, it was clean!!!You can't beat the price, especially for the location.

<Content>Great Deal For The Price we only paid $206 bucks for 3 nites w/ all taxes on spring break week. This hotel has a great location, nice area. we walked to chinatown(entrance is next door to the hotel), north beach, little italy, and took a bus to fisherman's wharf/alcatraz area. it's very easy to get around in san francisco. From the airport we took the BART (~50 min to get there)and got off like 5 blocks from the hotel and costs only 5 bucks per person. The breakfast was simple but we were glad it was included. I don't think i could have found a better hotel for this price in san francisco w/ a great location. use the hotel's website to book.

<Content>Good choice !!! I stayed recently at the Astoria for 8 nights, so maybe it麓s a good reference in terms of experience.First, the location: very good! It is near of some touristic points and from several bus lines. At the corner of Bush and Grant (easy to find after coming from the airport by BART (wich is the cheapiest way to get out of the airport and reach the center of the city, in case, Powel Station).Second, the rooms: clean. Towels were changed every day, bed clothes ok. The furniture were old, but no problem. Mattress was very comfortable. The shower, you can choose water so hot, cold or so-so as you want. There was a safe, but I did麓t used it. TV was old too, and few channels had good image, but I wasn麓t travelling to spend time with TV... There was no closed wardrobe (but it makes easier to not forget clothes). Everything was quiet (my room didn麓t face the street).The breakfast had milk, orange juice, coffee, bread, muffins, bagels, cream cheese, jelly, butter, toaster, microwave oven, and you can eat as much as you want.If you want internet connection you must go to the reception room because there was no wi-fi.All the service and people from the hotel was very good - they were very patient with my poor english :-))Finally, I suggest that if you want to stay there - and it麓s a very good choice - try to make your reservation using the hotel site. I found a great sale through it, which didn麓t appear in general-reservation-hotel-sites.

<Content>Hotel Astoria - great value for the price I was lucky enough to visit San Franscisco for a conference May 16 and 17. For two nights a friend and I stayed at the Marriott on 4th just south of Market - noted here to provide some perspective ;). Because we like to save our pennys for things other than expensive hotels, I did my research on this and other web sites, and settled on the Hotel Astoria for the remaining 3 nights. We were assigned a room on the 7th floor, facing away from the streets, so did not have significant amounts of street noise (I live a block off of an interstate freeway...). The breakfast was typical hotel continental breakfast fare - muffins, bagels or bread (from Costco?), coffee (drinkable, not great...) and OJ. Filling enough to get us up and out. Better than the food were the people - we met visitors from other areas of the US, Croatioa, Brazil, Netherlands, Belgium and other places. Positives: The room was relativaly quiet - altho I did hear a group of people walk down the hallway sometime in the middle of one night. The room was clean, the bathroom appeared to have been remodeled recently - new fixtures, shower stall, tile. The property was centrally located - easy access to the Muni, Bart, Cable Cars. We (two women) felt safe walking around the area of San Francisco the hotel was located in (we usually returned to our room around 10 pm each night). Breakfast was filling. We had a small table and chairs in the room, set in the corner, under the window (which opened too far for my liking - if I wwere traveling with small children). Negatives: The elevator is a bit scary... but did work to get us up to our 7th floor room. The view from our window was, well, there was no view... The TV reception was lousy (there seemed to be quite a few channels - I don't have cable - so my perspective may be skewed). There is a deadbolt on the room door - but the room key doesn't lock it... so the room is only secured with the door knob lock when you are out (the deadbolt and a chain can be used from inside the room). We were not after amenities - only a clean room with a private bath and two beds (twin beds). We did not plan to watch TV, so did not care about the bad reception. This is a great hotel to stay in if you plan to be out sightseeing most of your time in San Francisco. If you expect to be pampered, have amenities of any sort - perhaps you'd be happier some place else. I will definatly consider staying at the Hotel Astoria next time I go to San Francisco.

<Content>No better place to crash The hotel has one of the best location with the best price. It is polarizing though, half will love it, the other will hate it. Here's why:Hate-it camp:The room is nothing but basic accomodation - nothing more than a basic mattress, a small TV, clean bathroom and that's it. it's noisy, being 2 blocks from union square does not help. I stayed at the 7th floor and I can still hear the street noise. If the room is transferred to a motel 6, nobody will notice the difference.Love-it camp:2 blocks from union square and next to Chinatown for $55/night with a queen bed, a decent continental breakfast and a clean room. My days in SF usually starts with me having breakfast btw 7-8 then go wander around the city until 9-10 at night. At the end of the day, all that's needed is a crash pad - this place fits that like a custom-made suit.Also it's very easy to get decent food. Both Eastern and Golden Gate bakeries are within walking distance; great chinese pastries and curry pies; numerous dim sum places, and at least one really good clay pot place (Bow Hon). For you Starbucks fiend, there's one right accross the street.

<Content>Good value for the budget-minded traveler Last time I was in San Francisco, I saw the Astoria and thought it looked like a decent-enough hotel. When I was called to the city on sudden business, I checked the Astoria's rates and found them to be astonishingly low for the hotel's location. I also checked Trip Advisor and saw mixed reviews. Based on what I read, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I decided to go ahead and stay at the Astoria -- I needed a cheap place to stay.Maybe it's because I didn't hold high hopes for the Astoria, but my stay there was a pleasant one. The hotel reminds me very much of places I've stayed in London -- small lift, narrow staircases.My room, which had an attached bath (I understand that some rooms do not have an ensuite, another similarity to small London hotels), was rather spartan (there is a television but no clock radio) but very clean. The very large window looked onto a small patio and could be opened widely for lots of fresh air. My room was very quiet too. While I could hear people pass in the hallway now and then, I did not hear guests talking in their rooms or watching television. It was peaceful.The bathroom was immaculate. In fact, I am hard-pressed to remember a cleaner hotel bathroom in my more recent travels. In terms of amenities, you will want to bring your own hair dryer, but the hotel does provide a shower cap, soap, and shampoo -- very basic toiletries on par with what you might find at a Red Roof Inn.The hotel's location is fantastic. The Montgomery BART station is two blocks away. Union Square and shopping heaven are two blocks down and one over. Chinatown is literally right outside the door. For people who want a bit more than the Astoria's continental breakfast, there is a Starbucks right across the street, another one a block down, and several pubs and cafes in between.Overall, my experience at the Astoria was great. It's clean and functional, and while it might not be the ideal setting for a romantic weekend getaway or a luxurious vacation, it's perfect for people who just need a convenient, clean, economical, well-situated place to crash. I will definitely be staying there again.

<Content>Good rates and location We were looking for something inexpensive in the city that was safe. We didn't need frills. This was perfect. There is a parking garage directly across the street. The room had a walk in closet and cute bathroom. There was plenty of room. The hotel was nice in a San Fanncisco old-style way. The elevator was scary. It lurched about. We usually took the stairs. The staff is very friendly. We'd stay there again. There wasn't any air conditioning when we stayed there, so if it's very hot, I'd check with staff before booking. We were fine with open windows. The view of the city is also nice.

<Content>Good bargain for location if all you need is a place to stay I did a LOT of research to find the cheapest lodging in San Francisco that I could while still being in a safe, convenient location. We recognized we'd have to give up some amenities, but figured we wouldn't spend much time in our hotel anyway. The Astoria Hotel fit the bill and we were not disappointed.We booked on their website, which got us the cheapest rate I could find on a double room (2 beds) with a private bathroom ($65/nt). The room was clean, had a large closet and a good sized bathroom. There is no AC (not uncommon to boutique hotels in the area) but that was fine for this time of year. Despite what they tell you, they do have parking set up for $22/day (full in/out priveleges) with a garage about 2 blocks away. They also had an iron and ironing board available when we needed it, which surprised me based on what I was prepared for. We did have one problem upon arrival. Our room wasn't clean and the cleaning person told me it couldn't be cleaned until the next day so I should get a different room. The desk person then tried to tell us we could only have a non-smoking room, but I stood my ground and a second person took over, giving us the equivalent non-smoking room (I saw both and think we actually ended up with a larger closet). The whole thing took about 10 minutes and worked out fine, so it wasn't a real issue for us.Overall, if you want an inexpensive base point for your stay and aren't expecting anything beyond a clean, comfortable room, this is the place for you. Oh, union square ,which has all forms of public transportation available is only a couple blocks away, and the cable car passes almost right by the hotel. Many of the cooler neighborhoods are also walking distance, including Chinatown, which has great dim sum.

<Content>Good Budget Option- Great Location First let me say, this is not a hotel for someone looking for luxuryor extras. There is no concierge and the rooms are the true meaning of basic. However if you are looking for a great location and are budget conscious this is a good option for you. The location can't be beat. It's at Bush and Grant, right at the gates of Chinatown. Walking distance to Union Square, Cable Car and Muni Stops, shopping and dining.The staff is very polite and helpful. I had some questions before we checked in and they were very quick to respond by email.The building itself is old and the elevator works but is a bit noisy.The rooms were cleaned daily but very basic. No fancy decor.The furniture was old and the TV was on top of a dresser instead of inside an Armoire. I found the bed to be just fine as far as comfort goes and had no problems sleeping even though we faced the street. However I would recommend ear plugs to those who are light sleepers.The one complaint I would have is the towels. They are a cotton poly blend. If this is an issue for you bring your own, or there is a Ross in Union Square very close that you can buy cheap but 100% cotton towels to use.

<Content>Cheap but.... The Good: Very good and strategic location. Quite clean and cheap.The Bad: The room is not soundproof... you can hear cars honking or passing by almost all night long. (we stayed on the 6th floor!) And there was a construction going on several buildings away. The noise was unbearable. The room had a very strong bleach smell when we first entered. Noisy and creaking beds. If budget is not a problem, I wouldn't recommend this place. Otherwise, you might want to ask for a room that's not facing the main street.

<Content>Best for a budget break... This little, friendly hotel is ideally located right next to the Gateway into Chinatown and within easy walking distance of Union Square and various bus routes to get you around the city. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful and the rooms clean. There are phones in the rooms but no internet, however there is a really nice internet cafe a few blocks down and starbucks opposite for those with laptops! The hotel also offers a shuttle to the airport which will pick up at any time. This hotel is really good value for money (only a little more expensive for 2 people than a hostel) and def better value than many of the other hostels which try and charge you 4 times as much for very few extras. When I return to San Francisco I would def stay here. P.S. The lift is a little dodgy- think of the film Thoroughly Modern Millie and you'll know what I mean!

<Content>Fantastically located, bargain hotel! We spent three nights in the Astoria as part of a 14 night trip around California staying in everything from motels to quality hotels.The Astoria did everything it said on the tin! The location is superb, a short walk from Union Square, even closer to Chinatown, and within easy reach of all cable car lines and other transport links. The property itself is quite old, and could do with a makeover ideally, but it is kept very clean and tidy, and is perfectly comfortable. The continental breakfast was simple but considerably better than many we experienced! The service from the front desk was excellent - arranging for a shuttle to the airport, advising us where to find an internet cafe and the post office etc with no bother at all.And where else could you find a suite in such a location for $80 a night?!

<Content>Responsiveness and Hospitality If you bargain for convenience, comfort and competitive rate, Hotel Astoria can not be second best. It simply the best bargain. I like, in particular, its website ------------- and the on-line reservation service. Before making reservation, I e-mailed a couple of times about the cancellation policy, parking and even shuttle bus service, to my surprise, I got very professional, detailed, above all, prompt response which make me feel that even though I can only pay for this rate I was treated like VIP.My top choice in downtown San Francisco is Hotel Astoria, and the number one place to make reservation is -------------No hassle.--Jim

<Content>its nothing fancy but... the rooms are clean and the people are friendly. For the price, it is an excellent deal. It's walking distance to the finanical district, downtown, and literally at the gate to Chinatown. There's plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. The beds are hard but the sheets are clean. There's no alarm clock in the room, so be sure to bring your own. Although the hotel doesn't have wireless, I could get a good (and open) signal from a nearby hotel from my front-facing room on the fourth floor. If you're on a budget, this is the place to stay.

<Content>clean, friendly and moderately priced I don't normally write reviews, but couldn't help the overwhelming feeling to defend this hotel in regards to the negative review that I just read while reserving a room.I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times and will be staying again this summer. To anyone considering a moderately priced, clean and friendly hotel that is conveniently located, this is the place for you. It's located next to the gate to China Town and the owners are polite and offer a continental breakfast. Although the desk clerk may not have the architectual background to inform the guests about the building's foundation and it's historical background, any questions regarding your room, transportation and other realistic questions regarding travel, will be kindly answered. One more thing, it's a typical older SF building and so the lift is a little slow.
