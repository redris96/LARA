<Content>Great Hotel - Fantastic Location! We wanted a reasonably priced hotel which was within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter and stumbled on the Gran Ronda.The hotel is a very pleasant 5-10 minute walk from both of these and is seconds from the nearest Metro station, which is dead easy to use for all the main sights.We had a twin and a double room on the 5th floor, both with balcony doors opening onto the main street. The rooms were a good size and bathrooms large. Everything was clean.Yes the beds are hard, as we'd read in the reviews, but we like that!We'd read about the noise from the metro underneath and yes you can hear it rumble but it wasn't enough to wake you / keep you awake at night.The staff on reception were extremely helpful whenever we approached them.We didn't eat or drink at the hotel and can't say we even noticed the bar / restaurant areas so can't comment.All in all a great hotel in a great location. We stayed for one night and would certainly return.

<Content>Very So-So We stayed at hotel gran ronda for 3 nights, we had asked our travel agent to call hotel and ask for early check in as we were coming straight off a cruise ship, she was told by guy on phone as long as we have empty rooms not a problem, night before we were meant to arrive we checked internet and yes rooms available.Next morning we were up at 6am off ship by 9 in hotel by 9.30am-ish, went to desk got told room wouldnt be ready till 2pm! Said ok but asked for a room to the front with balcony said fine that would be ok. went back to hotel 1.50pm room still not ready said havent you got anything, he said we can get another room ready in 20 mins or so! but it isnt a front room and wont have a balcony. What they had been doing in past 4 and a bit hours is still a mystery!! By this time we were exhausted and said fine whatever. Room was small, smaller than our balcony cabin on ship. we had a big patio door/window which looked out onto a junk tip. That night we went to front desk and a nice guy called sebastian recommended a lovely paella place at port olympic which was really great. he definately was the best of the front desk people. the other 2 we encountered were very much blah about everything. Our next encounter with them was our next to last night our flight wasnt till 9pm we asked for late check out, was told check out was 12 noon and if we wanted to stay even 2 hours later be a full day of 70 odd euros. We declined. Check out day they stored our luggage for us and we could use lobby facilities.Hotel is handy for metro and placa cataluyna there is a small spar shop opposite way from placa cataluyna. Port olympic is a must visit as is sagrida famillia, We did the tour bus red and blue routes and went to the nou camp which is on red route bus stops right outside front door.

<Content>Not recommended - find another hotel We were unhappy with this hotel and recommend that you find another place to stay. To be fair and balanced, here are the positives: The room and bathroom were an adequate size. The bathroom had a full tub and shower. There is a refrigerator in the room, and free wireless internet. The location is good with access to the Metro train and walking distance to La Rambla. The room is very clean. Breakfast is served in the hotel (for an additional charge). We didn't eat breakfast here, but our travel companions did and thought it was good.Ok, now the negatives: The only room they had available was a room without windows. When we expressed displeasure, the answer was pretty much too bad (and we heard that tone of response a lot). Without a window, the fact tha the air conditioner did not work was a problem. We complained about it all 3 days, and while they said they sent repairmen, it never did work properly (the hallway was always cooler). The mattresses are very firm. They mistakenly gave us a wake-up call that we didn't order (our first morning when we were jetlagged and needed our sleep). Slow sink drain. No facial tissues. Laundry is outrageously priced - 8-euros for pants, almost 5-euros for undergarments (for laundry, dry cleaning was more). We asked the front desk what the phone charges were for local and toll-free calls, and they didn't know (couldn't they look that info up somewhere?). The issues overall were minor, but taken together, and along with a truly indifferent/borderline rude front desk made for a below-average experience. There are tons of hotels -- I'd just go somewhere else.

<Content>Okay hotel but beware noise of the tube etc Just back from a second trip to Barcelona and stayed at the Gran Ronda, only 5-10 mins from the Ramblas.The first room we were given was VERY dark and small. It was an interior room so had no outside window. We asked to be moved which was no problem.The second room was fine but had clearly been done on a low budget...the shower was very rusty, the mini bar door was hanging off, leaking sink etc (given this is described as a 'new hotel' we were disappointed) but we had a safe in the room and a balcony looking on to the road which was good.The staff were helpful and there is free internet access available which is useful if you need to print tickets etc.I wouldn't book this hotel again as although the location was good (only 5-10 mins to the ramblas etc), it was VERY noisy with the tube running beneath the hotel, noise from the reception and from other rooms travelling through the thin walls and loads of banging doors. There was a lot of noise from the outside road but we did ask for a window so you can't have everything.Overall: VERY Noisy (especially the tube beneath the hotel), a bit shabby but friendly staff and good location and not too expensive...but I've stayed in better hotels in Barcelona for much less!

<Content>Good Base for Barcelona We decided we wanted to get away for a couple of days, and since neither of us had been to Barcelona, it seemed the ideal choice.After booking, and cancelling some hotels, the significant other decided she liked the look of this boutique hotel.The hotel was clean and tidy, the rooms were very chic and modern, if a little on the small side. The bathroom was compact, the shower was however generous, and powerrful. Hot water was abundant.I had the breakfast on a couple of the mornings, which was expensive (11euros I think) which for coffee and toast is steep, but that was my choice.Although the hotel is on the main road, it is approx 10min walk to Cataluna square, at the top of the Ramblas, it is however close to the metro station, and the metro itself is really easy to understand. I would thoroughly recommend visitors to purchase travel cards for the bus and metro.On our first day, we decided to walk to the ramblas, anddown to the harbour, we actually ended up walking as far as the olympic harbour, where we found some excellent places to have lunch. We also fitted in the open top bus tour, which was fantastic, but here's a handy tip, in February, it is really chilly on the top deck!!All said, Barcelona was a good trip, and the Hotel although offering few facilities, was clean, reasonably quiet and conveniently located.

<Content>Good no frills hotel This is a good no frills hotel. Couldn't really fault the hotel for what it was. There was no restaurant or bar, but the amenities they had were good, clean and fit for purpose, The reception staff were all very polite and helpful. The hotel is within easy walking distance from La Ramblas. If you want a reasonably priced hotel in the heart of the city, this one fits the bill. There are obviously hotels on La Ramblas but you will pay a lot more. We travel to a lot of cities, and always get a hotel centrally based, to be near the main tourist attractions, this also saves on cab fares. Even though we usually stay in higher grade hotels, we left it late to book and couldn't get the usual rate we look for with a higher grade. We were pleasantly surprised with the Gran Ronda Hotel.

<Content>Great, central hotel We booked this hotel through LastMinute.com and were really pleased with it. It's in a very central location, 2 mins from Universitat metro and 10 mins to Placa de Catalunya / Las Ramblas. The hotel is basic but modern with wooden floors, wooden furniture and neutral colours. Bathroom was a good size with a very nice shower. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Overall, if you're looking for a cheap, cheerful and central place to stay, this is a very good choice.

<Content>Fab place Good hotel. Friendly service. We didn't eat at the hotel at all as it was really central. Metro stop within 2 minutes walk and also lots of little cafes for breakfast. Ate dinner out as well, walking distance from lots of lovely places. About a 15 minute (sight-seeing on the way) walk to Ramblas.Room clean and well kept. On a note of caution if you have an interior facing room then pull your curtains or you may be giving those in the glass fronted elevator a view that you may not wish to share!Staff very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great spot, firm bedsThe hotel The hotel is in a great spot on a main road just a few hundred yards from Universitat metro station and a ten minute walk from Placa Catalunya and the top of La Ramblas.We booked two rooms each for two adults only a few days before our stay and got a good deal of around 90 euros per room which for a three-star is not bad going (don't believe what you see on the web about it being a four-star - it's not!).The guy on reception when we arrived on Saturday evening was very friendly and polite and spoke excellent English and the reception area was smart and modern.Although when booking we'd asked for rooms on the front of the building with windows overlooking the street, one was actually by the lift overlooking the foyer so for any kind of privacy you would have to close the curtains and we were concerned about the noise.But we asked to change and they were happy to switch us to a room with a street view.The hotel looks like it has recently been refurbished and the rooms are very modern - all dark wood and painted walls - and uncluttered, with decent-sized bathrooms (with constant hot water and a power shower), air con/heating, and small, flat screen TVs.Noise from the street did filter in as the windows didn't shut tightly enough but there are shutters and heavy curtains which help minimise it and after a long day sight-seeing it didn't stop us getting to sleep!Breakfast wasn't included and I think it is quite expensive if you pay for it there seperately but we found a nice place at the top of La Ramblas which served english and spanish breakfasts.The room was cleaned to a good standard but quite late in the day - it was getting done when we returned from sight-seeing at around 4.30pm - and the staff we came across were friendly.We didn't need much advice from reception about where to go and how to get there but they were approachable and always available.The street was bustling on the Saturday night when we arrived but Sunday's seem to be quite a dead day in the area - there are lots of electronics shops - but even when it was quiet it felt as safe as you could expect for a big city, although a short-cut through El Raval from La Ramblas isn't advised at night if you're not in a group.The only real gripe about the rooms would be that the matresses are quite hard and the amount of bedding you get isn't enough for February.All in all I'd recommend this hotel for a 1-3 night stay but if you were staying for longer, a four-star with a bit space and facilities like a gym or pool might be better, or perhaps even an apartment.

<Content>Good location and value We stayed at the Gran Ronda for 3 nights during our stay in Barcelona. We paid 120 euros a night, and it was worth every penny.Our rooms were very modern, with a beautiful bathroom and flat screen tv. The hotel is situated north of Placa Catalunya in the business district, and it was very close to the Universidad Metro station. We could easily walk everywhere, although we did enjoy taking the speedy train as well.I would definitely recommend this hotel, and I hope to return one day!

<Content>great location and lovely room I found the Gran Ronda hotel to be a lovely well located hotel in Barcelona...5 mins walk to Las Ramblas and 1 min walk to the nearest metro where you can access almost anywhere in the city... We requested a double room the morning we arrived as the website we booked on would not allow us to and we were accommodated..the room was facing out on to the street..there was no smell of drains or no noise..except the cleanin lady knocking at our door..but we did sleep in late!! The staff were helpful,especiallythe lady who checked us in..we didnt get breakfast as i thought it was a little pricy,but ate out instead.. all in all a lovely stay in the Gran Ronda :)

<Content>Expensive  I was very disappointed with the hotel. First appearances were good - friendly reception  nice looking room. But our room stank of bad drains,  despite our complaints about this, the staff did not seem to take this very seriously - refusing to let us change rooms (even though there were rooms free)  shrugging their shoulders  saying that they had done all they could by cleaning the bathroom again. I guess this is one of the perils of having paid upfront for a hotel. I was very disappointed about this, especially given that this is a 3 star hotel  cost 180 euros a night (for a twin). The thought of spending our nights in a stinking room, plus having to deal with unhelpful staff, cast a shadow over our stay in Barcelona, which otherwise was a fantastic city.

<Content>Good Hotel, Bit far from the beach Booked on lastminute for a hotel plus filght deal. Finding the hotel was no problem, just take the aerobus from the airport, the big blue bus, which takes you all the way to placa catalunya and stops at various places. Get off at placa universitat which is the penultimate stop and walk down the road st. antoni. its about 2mins walk on your right. Its not the busiest of roads and the hotel is next to some electronics shop. We arrived pretty late and were mildly annoyed at having to stay in a double bed rather than a twin room as booked, as we were two guys. The hotel staff were helpful in moving our bags to the adjacent room which had twin beds in the morning.Morning buffet breakfast is fine and held in a smallish room in the basement. There appeared to be a mixture of tourist nationalities, with i think one hen party whilst i stayed, but they were the civilized type, in the daytime anyway. Finding Las Ranblas is pretty simple as its 5mins walk away, but the beach is a rather longer walk of 20mins due to having to wlk around the harbour. We decided on a principle of walking a different route everyday and we found that walking south through El Raval is generally NOT a good idea if you're female and on your own. We stumbled upon the prostitute street at 11am!!! which was a nice wake up call. If heading to the harbour and the beach, go via Las Ramblas. There are two metro stations very nearby and you should buy the T10 pass which gives you 10 trips. More than enough for a week's holiday. The rooms were decent sized, clean with a nice tv. There can be no complaints on the hotel, and there's free internet in the reception. The room has a safety deposit box, a safe baggage store and the staff were friendly all round. Though on checkout, there was some confusion over the breakfast and mini-bar bills, but this was sorted out without fuss.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone travelling solo or group if it appeals. There was no problem with noise, and if you want a balcony, ask for a street-facing room. Great view. I have no photos as my computer harddrive decided to die on me over the summer, but the website photos are pretty genuine.

<Content>Great Hotel-Shame about the city I stayed at the Gran Ronda for one night in early November 2007. I have to say an absolutely fantastic hotel. Rooms are very modern with superb bathroom facilities and flat screen tv. The room also has a mini safe which comes in handy. The staff are also very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.The downsides are that the street outside the hotel is very sleazy at night. Don't let this put you off as many streets in Barcelona are like this.Watch out for the lowlife pickpockets, especially on the metro. Keep an eye on your bag/wallet at all times and you will be ok. I was only in Barcelona 6 hours and my wallet was stolen from my pocket despite only having my hand out my pocket for all of 30 seconds on the metro.All in all, great Hotel, its a shame my experience of Barcelona in general has deterred me from visiting ever again.

<Content>Great location, good value My partner and I stayed at Gran Ronda 3 nights and we really enjoyed it. I asked a room with an external window and a double bed (French bed) and our choice was respected.The room and bathroom were large and tmodern and the bed was very confortable.Staff was very nice too and gave us a good map of Barcelona with directions.But the must about this hotel is the location. It was close enough to the Pla莽a de Catalunya (10 minutes walking) and at the same time, far away enough so you don't have to pay ridiculous prices for a sandwich. Avoid having any lunch or dinner at the Ramblas as it is so expensive. We had a coffee and a croissant for 1.50 鈧?near the hotel!I recommand this hotel for its value too, while checking on the internet, we found that some hostels or pensions were charging the same price for much less comfortable roomsAll in all, we had a very pleasant stay at Gran Ronda

I must warn you though if you are staying longer than a weekend ask for a room with an external window as they also have rooms with internal windows facing the lifts, these are dark and quite small.We asked to swap as we were there for a week, had to wait until the following day but staff were helpful and happy to do so. Rooms very clean, spotless bathrooms, comfortable bed.Would definately stay there again.

The hotel itself was with very 'hotel' standard rooms, very new with a powerful shower and lovely sheets on the beds! I felt it was good value for money and would perhaps stay there again. Staff helpful and excellent breakfast. My only complaints were that the beds were twins pushed together to make a double - easy to fall down the middle! Also our ground floor 'balcony' looked more like somewhere you would put your bins.

The staff were great, the rooms were spotless as was all the hotel.Breakfast was buffet and more than expected and better than we have had in more expensive hotels.We stayed on the fifth floor with a small balcony overlooking the tree lined road.The hotel also boasts a central opening with a glass domed roof for the two lifts, really bright and open.If you require a central hotel with room air conditioning, safe, TV, mini bar and clean....then your stay here will fill the bill.Expect to pay between 30 and 35 Euros for the taxi from the airport.The city is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Hotel Gran Ronda, ok, but...... The pictures and the website of the hotel are a little misleading. I was disapointed as I imagined this to be part of a nice chain of hotels......The good points: the hotel is 2 min walk from Plaza Universitat (metro), just in front of a bus stop and 10 min walk from Rambla. The bathroom was very clean, spacious, the bed was comfortable and very clean as well. Breakfast was also nice. However.....the bad points: The room itself was really really tiny. The common areas of the hotel are really dodgy. The reception area looks bad and the receptionists were nice, but not that helpful. Overall it was an OK experience for a couple of nights at a reasonable price, but I will try and find another hotel next time.

<Content>Great location,beware of rooms facing the inside! Ok this is a hard one for me...We went there for a weekend and we chose it after reading all these good reviews at TA.I'll try and be objective - you'll what I mean.The location is great!Couldn't have been better!We walked everywhere,it is very central and its safe to walk around it at night.Staff where so and so.They were nice but didn't really care when we comlained.We had a problem with our sink the first night.It was full of water and we couldn't wash ourselves so I called reception and the guy said he is on his own so can't do anything but will try to get someone..Went down a bit later to talk to him to complain about our room and in the end he said to me: Do you still want me to call someone to fix the sink?.....The fixed it within an hour!The room...every floor has 2 rooms that have a window facing the elevators and the foayer.They are tiny (I personally dont mind that..) and they have LOADS of noice.Whatever happens downstairs you hear!Impossible to sleep...No daylight coming in...However, it was a nice room,comfortable bed,very clean and nice bathroom.All in all would definitely recommend this hotel as long as you go for the better rooms!I think its a disgrace that they charge them the same and we did compain about it.Unfortunately it was fully booked and they couldn't move us.Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that.

<Content>Will Return to the Apsis Gran Ronda We have just returned from a three night stay at the Apsis Gran Ronda. We really liked it. The room was comfortable, clean and had all the necessary amenities, TV, safe, minibar. The breakfast, which was included in our rate, was more than adequate to set you up for a days sightseeing.It was a 5-10 minute walk away from Ramblas and Pl Catalunya. Less than 5 minutes from Pl Universitat where you can get off the aerobus and where there is a metro station. We thought it was in an excellent position and will definitely return.A lot of people have commented about personal safety in Barcelona. We did not feel unsafe anywhere. We visited a lot of areas, used the Metro and spent a lot of time walking around and didn't feel concerned about our safety once. Like any large city anywhere in the world you just have to be sensible about flashing your cash or valuables around but other than that it is certainly not the den of theives and pickpockets that some would lead you to believe.

<Content>stayed longer than expected because it was sooooo good! My boyfriend and I booked for a 3 night break at the Apsis Gran Ronda to cheer us up after christmas and new year. It cheered us up so much that we changed our flights and stayed a further 3 nights! The hotel staff really could not do enough for us and were very pleasant and helpful (and this was before they knew we were staying longer) They offered us a deal to stay for the extra 3 nights . Rooms were clean and modern with minibar and free safety deposit box.We asked for a room over the road as they had a balcony.When the doors are closed it is quiet even though it is a busy road. We stayed in two different rooms as we had already packed and checked out before we had decided to stay on longer. Our 1st room had a bath and shower and the 2nd just had a large shower but both were great. Beds comfortable, power showers, hairdryer. I had read that the rooms were small but they were fine. How much time do you spend in the room when you are sight seeing anyway! Free internet in the foyer (where we changed our flights!) Location great, in a safe area. There are many different routes to take to get to las ramblas but shortest took about 10mins. Do not walk through la raval alone at night, bit dodgy.A prostitute lifted her top up in front of my boyfriend and then felt his bum but he kept his hand firmly on his wallet which is what they are after! no offence to my boyfriend! Placa Catalunya- the main centre is also about 10mins walk away from the hotel, this is where you can catch the aerobus to the airport for 3.75 euros each, rather than 30 euros for a taxi. Barcelona is fabulous, areas I suggest are el born (trendy bars, good vibe), Gracia district, Gothic Quarter. Basically all of it, except la raval! Oh yes las ramblas is so expensive so go to the side streets, you will find some fab little places. Sorry about the novel but hope it helps!

<Content>Excellent apart from one irritation This hotel is conveniently located, just a few minutes walk from the University and quite close to La Rambla. Our room had a balcony overlooking the street but, with the doors closed, it was quiet. Big room, very clean, fresh towels daily, good maid service and efficient air-conditioning. Buffet breakfast was fine and there is free internet access in the foyer. The only irritation was the keycard system - each day, after the 12.00 checkout deadline, the cards stopped working, even though we were staying for six nights. As we were on the fifth floor this was more than a little annoying as it meant going back to reception to queue again and get the cards re-programmed, after the third occasion we had the cards re-programmed on entry. The reception staff offered a range of excuses but seemed to accept the problem as 'normal'.

<Content>ideal location, decent hotel My friend and I stayed here for a long weekend - had heard a lot of bad press about Barcelona with regards to street crime / bag snatching etc, so were keen on this hotel after reading other people mention its nice safe location in their reviews. The street itself is pretty busy and well lit and no more than a 10min walk / drunken stagger from La Rambla with all its nightspots so we were very pleased. Is central for all other touristy destinations, most of which are walkable, and is right in the middle of 2 metro stops which was handy for venturing further afield. Room was fine - clean and beds were comfy, only negative comment was that on 2nd day there was a definite drain smell in the bathroom unfortunately. Didn't bother with 12 euro breakfast, zillions of patisseries en route to wherever you're heading in the morning which were lots cheaper and very tasty! This isn't a luxury hotel, but it looks smart, was in a great location and was ideal for our trip so wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>great hotel in a great location The Gran Ronda hotel has nice rooms with a modern touch; flat screen TV and very nice bathroom. The hotel is in a very good location; close to everything. The breakfast was good. I would stay here again!

<Content>great hotel, great location Stayed 4 nights. Room may seem small but was fine for our purpose. Best nights sleep in a long time. Must find out where they bought their mattresses. Rooms cleaned every day  fresh towels daily very much appreciated. Very convenient location, just short walk to La Rambla.Only downside - don't eat breakfast too late if you want bacon  egg otherwise food fine. Also don't venture too far down the street, away from university area as it appears to be a bit of a red light district.

<Content>Excellent for a Three Star! We have just returned from a three night stay at the Gran Ronda. The room was of a decent size and seemed like it had recently been refurbished. The bathrrom was a wet room style and very spacious. We had requested a room with a balcony which we got and faced on to the main road Ronda San Antonio. We thought it would be noisy as it was a very busy street but once the balcony doors were shut you literally didn't hear a thing. On arrival the room was very clean and we got fresh linen and toels every day. There was also a really good air conditioning unit in the room with controls. A short five minute walk was all it took to get to the middle of La Rambla and there was a metro station two hundred yards from the hotel (Universitat). We didn't choose the breakfast option but it was available for a supplement. All round excellent value for money and would definately return.

<Content>Great hotel! Stayed here in earlier this month for a few nights and was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. Very modern, good facilities, good breakfast served late (although the choice was sometimes limited if you left it TOO late...), and very central for all sites and tourist attractions. All in all, I'd recommend it.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed for 3 nights from 5th July - 8th July 2006 at the Gran Ronda hotel,Barcelona. We got the bus from the airport,at just 3.60 euros each and they run at approx 10 min intervals.The closest stop is Univestat,but you can also get off at Placa Cataluna and walk to the Gran Ronda.We arrived at the hotel at around 12 o'clock (mid-day) and the room wasn't ready.We were able to leave our luggage in a secure location in the Hotel and went out for a wander around.It's approx 10 min walk/stroll to Placa Catalunya and La Ramblas,with plenty shops,bars and restaurants on the way. Every shop has got the Sales on (Rebajas in spanish!!),so you can pick up plenty bargains !.The hotel room was nice and clean with wooden floor and plazma screen TV.We had a double bedded room and the bed was very comfortable too.The bathroom was clean and spacious with new towels every-day.Only problem was that the electricity runs from your card-key,so when you return to the room at night,the air-conditioning has been off,but it didn't take too long to cool the room down once you inserted the key to activate it.Breakfast is from 7.30am-11am,buffet style with a wide range available.Bread rolls,croissants,pastries,cheese,ham,cheese spread,spanish omlette,cereals,fruit,yoghurt,toast,butter,jam,scrambled egg,bacon,mini-sausage,coffee,tea,mineral water,fruit juice....a great start to the day !!.We were going to stay at a 2* room only hotel,just off La Ramblas originally,but we're so glad that we upgraded to this 3* and paid that bit extra,as it was definately worth it for the comfort and breakfast alone. The Hop-on Hop-off bus is a great way to see Barcelona,there are 3 routes,North,South and Forum.It costs 22 euros per adult for 48 hours.We ate at the Taxidermista restaurant,Placa Reial and would recommend it as we had a lovely meal.All in all,there are so many restaurants/bars to choose from,which range in price,in one bar just around the corner from the Hotel,called Bar Goya,we paid 5 euros for 2 large beers,yet in another bar,which was actually on La Ramblas,we paid 24 euros for 2 large beers,it's alot cheaper to eat/drink in one of the bars/restaurants off La Ramlas if you're on a budget.As we had an early morning flight home,we decided to take a taxi back the airport,which cost us just under 30 euros......All in all we had a great time and would definately recommend the Hotel Gran Ronda.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay! We stayed here for 3 nights in June and really enjoyed our stay. We got a good deal on the room off of EasyHotel so I did not know what to expect but was really surprised how nice it was. We had a balcony on to the busy street and when you shut the doors it completely block out all noise-that was a first for me in Europe. Very clean, central locations, really easy to get to from the airport, friendly/helpful staff. Would definitely return

<Content>Wonderful hotel. The Apsis Gran Ronda is a wonderful place to stay. It is a centrally located, six floor hotel with an atrium lobby and is very close to Metro and bus access. The hotel was opened in 2004 and the rooms are decorated in earth-tones, have an in-room combination safe, a mini-bar, flat panel television, air conditioning, marble tile bathroom and parquet wood flooring. The beds are comfortable with plenty of pillows and I slept well every night. Rooms tend to be small which not unusual for Barcelona. Street noise was non existant especially in rooms toward the back of the hotel. The neighborhood appears to be safe and has numerous restaurants and cafes. Several supermarkets are within walking distance.The staff are accommodating, professional and courteous. The hotel offers breakfast with all the usual choices. Internet access is available in the lobby and is free to hotel guests. I will stay at the Apsis Gran Ronda on future trips to Barcelona.

<Content>Great Value I stayed with my friend for a girlie city break for 2 nights. Very nice hotel, really clean and great modern furnishings and bathroom. Good value for money. Ask for a road facing room, then you will get a nice little balcony, the road is busy but when the doors are closed you can鈥檛 hear anything. The rooms are small but big enough for a few days break. Staff are friendly enough, but don鈥檛 go out of their way. Rooms and sheets are cleaned daily.Would recommend getting the bus from the airport, its really easy and they are very regular. Just need to get off at the Universitat and walk down the road for 5 minutes.There are loads of shops, restaurants and bars nearby very reasonably priced, so long as you stay off the Ramblas. Really nice area to go out at night is the beach and harbour. Would recommend getting a tourist bus pass, as it鈥檚 an easy way to make sure you at least see all the sights even if you don鈥檛 time to get off the bus and see them properly.I was scared by stories of pickpockets but didn鈥檛 see any trouble, you just need to be aware and keep your bag close to you and get taxi鈥檚 back late at night.Barcelona is a fantastic city, can't wait to go back!

<Content>Excellent Choice We were helped in our decision by the reviews we read about the hotel and, for once, we struck lucky with our choice of hotel. We had asked for a room with a view, well you can only ask!, and we got a room to the front that looked onto the main street which was shielded by beautiful trees and offered a cooling breeze.The room was clean, cosmopolitan and offered all that a traveller would require....though if tall the bath would be a tad small!In the morning we were amazed by the choice and quality of the breakfast, which was included in our particular deal and was served a very generous 7.30-11.00. It filled you up for a busy days sight seeing. Ranging from cooked,continental,fruit,cake,yoghurts....Handy for all sites and a brief walk to the Square where the Tourist buses meet allowing for plenty of easy sightseeing. No problems leaving luggage to be collected later - if needed.Ask for a room overlooking the street as internal rooms may be stuffy??Would definitely return to this hotel if back to Barcelona.

<Content>great value I stayed here for one night only this past week and was very pleasantly surprised at the price vs the quality of the room. I paid only 鈧?89. so was not expecting much. What I found as a very neat, modern lobby, and a very small, but nicely furnished and very clean small double for single use. The bathroom was very big and had everything I needed--shower only, but I prefer this in any case. The staff were 95% wonderful--one seemed a bit lazy, but it certainly didn't impact my stay.Location is great, though I did notice quite a few working girls on this street, but you can get everywhere quite easily from here. I took the bus from/to the airport for 鈧?3.75 each way--takes a while, but that's a real bargain.Starbucks down the street if you like that sort of thing on holiday--I dodged it and had coffee at a local place, and later a few beers at an even more local place.I would recommend this to anyone who is not looking for a full service hotel, but who wants good value and cleanliness.Also, internet access is free on 2 computers downstairs--these were a life saver for me when I was there.

<Content>Good Hotel My Mum and I stayed at this Hotel at the end of May, we found the staff helpful, the Hotel was clean and tastefully modern. The location of the Hotel couldn't be better, little more than a 5 mins strole to Las Ramblas that was ideal for us.Our room was front facing and we had a lovely balcony which looked over the beautiful bustling street below, I would reccommend requesting a room of this nature if you can.An all round great place to stay.

<Content>Good location, contemporary design, friendly staff We were looking for a contemporary hotel in a convenient location to discover Barcelona as tourists. We stayed 5 nights in early April with a family of 4 and would return to the Gran Ronda without hesitation.Location: Walking distance to tourist attractions in El Raval, Barri Gotic, La Ribera. Bus stop to Port Vell, Montjuic, Eixample, Gracia in front of Hotel. Metro at 200 m. Rooms: Modern and clean. However, they vary in size! On the first night we had to stay in 2 doubles that would be fine for single occupancy, but were offered to change to larger rooms the next morning. That worked without any problems. Rooms to the back are quiet. The ones facing the street have small balconies with french doors and participate in busy street life. There are rooms looking into the atrium in the center of the hotel as well.Staff: Friendly at all times. Maid service did not disturb. Breakfast: Is offered by the Hotel, but we went for one of the many caf茅s, participating in day to day life of a lively neighbourhood.In other words: We think it was good value for our money and stay there again on our next visit.

<Content>Excellent base in excellent City!!!! We stayed at the Apsis Gran Ronda for 3 nights in March. What can I say - EXCELLENT!!! We travelled to Barcelona from Liverpool airport for a budget holiday. We arrived at Reus. I had planned to get to the train station and travel to Barcelona that way but on arrival found a coach outside the airport for Barcelona - only 鈧?1 each! Bargain and it even had reclining seats!! Arrived at the hotel about lunch time so the room was not yet ready - the hotel stored our bags and we went for a walk!Got back to our room and it was fab!!! We had a room on the very busy main road but once the patio was closed, you could hear nothing!!!! Brilliant! Room, I admit was not massive, but what do you need a huge room for if you are only sleeping there!! Beds very comfy and bathroom spacious.Hotel staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help you - they even ordered us a taxi to get to the airport!!! Excellent!!Found a lovely Italian at the top of Las Ramblas - can't remember the name but it had a blue sign - worth a visit!I was worried about the thieving but if you keep your wits about yourself you will be fine. Also, someone recommended to me to take a dummy wallet with a couple of Euro in in case you are mugged - that way you are not loosing all your money!Overall the stay was brilliant - although tiring!! I would recommend doing the hop on hop off bus tours - 2 days for 鈧?2 each! We stayed on the bus all the way round and then went to the sights we wanted to see after (as the queues for the buses can be big at the good attractions).
