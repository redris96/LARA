<Content>Loved our Spaulding Hotel Very good location, centrally located close to Theaters and shopping. We were given a nice quiet room on the 6th floor overllooking the pool of the adjacent hotel property.We traveled with our teenage daughter who enjoyed being close to the hip boutiques such as HM, Urban Ourfitter and Forever 21. The room had hard wood floors and was clean and cosy. The lounge on the second floor was really convenient and had washers and dryers which was super.We will stay here again!

<Content>Horrible Horrible Place! I found this place when i got to San Francisco Union Square. Location was good. It looked decent from the outside. Rates were fairly decent (SO I THOUGHT). This is one of the scariest places I've ever stayed at. When i first got to the room, i thought, alright, it's small, looks old and dingy but for 85/night in downtown SF i can't complain. But than came nightfall when the crazy neighbor was making the scariest noises on earth! He sounded like a person who belonged in an institution. It was 11pm and i went downstairs to complain. It was worse when the receptionist didn't even understand of spoke much English which made it hard to communicate.And THAN, she told me that the MAN next door was a tenent at the place and the HOTEL WAS PART COMMUNITY HOUSING. This got me EXTREMELY angry. I paid $85/night to stay at a housing complex when i could've went across to street, paid $15 more to stay at 3-4 nice decent hotel. This taught me a great lesson. Always do a lost more research a head of time before jumping into any place that as a decent 'cover-up' front lobby. I AM NEVER EVER staying at this place again!!!

<Content>Good price - Not good hotel If you want a romatic gettaway or a indulging weekend in SF, don't stay here. This hotel provides bacis needs like a bed, a bathroom and a door to locks behind you, but not much more. The advantages of this hotel are two, location and price. Very close to Union Square and very decent price, but you get what you pay for. The tiles on or bathroom floor where loose, the blinds could not be closed, no ironboard or iron could be borrowed, we only got one hanger in the closet and were not provided with more upon request and they forgott to clean our room during one day. The room smelled kind of weird too and the noise from the street was quite loud at nights.

<Content>Honest review of Spaulding Hotel in San Francisco 9/12/08 The Spaulding Hotel was very close to all the fun and excitement of San Francisco on O'Farrell St. We arrived late at night and the hotel desk was still open and checked us in very quickly. you do have to pay for the room upon check in and not check-out like other places. Our room was small but we did'nt mind since we were only going to be there to shower and sleep. The bed was way too little, a double, I guess I'm just used to my king bed! Any way we went out that night and really didn't see or hear anything in the halls it was pretty quiet. Even when we came back after midnight not much noise or people. Although the elevator was old it worked properly. The doors to the rooms were a little busted up but seemed to be repaired and secure. The water got very hot, which was good becuase it could have been the other way around. the tub/shower did drain pretty slow. The only bad thing about the room was there was not an electrical plug in the restroom to blowdry or flatiron your hair. And the one under the desk didn't work. there was only one other outlet that powered the tv and fridge so I had to unplug these to do my hair with no mirror. This really sucked! the hotel is very old but our room had a new bathroom, carpet, furniture, new tv and an older fridge. If we go back to San Francisco I would stay here again just would bring an extension cord with me!

<Content>Budget accommodation with central location I am native San Francisco and had to help my friend look for a hotel room. I only had a few weeks to find a decent room for her for August, (peak season here) and there was availability for a week's stay for her at Spaudling Hotel. My friend was traveling alone and wanted some place that was safe, cheap, and central. We were looking for something around the 60-80 dollar range.Spaudling Hotel is located in an extremely central location, a few blocks from the cable car turnaround, a few blocks from Union Square. If you go by public transportation, everything is near you. BART (to get to San Francisco Airport) is 3 blocks away once you get off Powell Street Station. Food, drugstores, shopping, etc. is all seconds away from the hotel. As with most hotels in downtown, if you go west of Union Square, you will reach Tenderloin (a neighborhood considered shady by most tourists because there is a concentration of homeless people living there) but I think Spaudling is not quite in Tenderloin yet. I am female and would safely walk in the block where the hotel is at night.During the time my friend stayed there, I picked her up from the hotel each day. The room was basic- bed, TV with 4-5 channels, desk, chair, closet, night stand, lamp, and bathroom. everything was very clean. The hallway was a bit run down and there were public WC and showers on each floor. I would guess some rooms have shared accommodations. It does seem like some guests are long-term residents from the people I saw in the hallway. I have seen many single residency occupants in other hotels in San Francisco, and this was nothing compared to those. I felt safe during all the times I was in the hotel.Room doors were pretty old- bolt lock didn't work, but there was a peep hole. Door locked with regular lock.There is one elevator- super small and old fashion. My friend said breakfast was at the restaurant next door. When we checked in, the front desk had messed up the reservation and gave my friend less nights than she booked on their website. I had to help explain to the front desk staff and luckily, they gave her the extra nights. (They had no record, but fortunately, she printed out the confirmation). There is also no security downstairs, as I came and left without even a single staff noticing me.Don't expect top service or a spectacular, but if you are a budget traveler looking for a place to stay the night, Spaudling is not too bad based on the price and location. From what I have seen, the rooms were clean and the price was reasonable for the location. If you are coming to SF, don't spend your money on a fancy hotel room. There's so much else to do!!

<Content>unbelievably unhelpgul!! I am staying at Spaulding at the moment. We only have a few days so we wanted to quickly arrange some trips - but the extremely unfriendly receptionist has flatly refused to help us, or even let us use the phone to call the tour companies. We have no phone, the internet is too slow, so we're now setting off to macy's third floor to find a payphone. I am speechless!!

<Content>It is a decent stay with the price and location This is my first time coming to San Francisco and I choose to stay at Spaudling Hotel with my boyfriend as we think the price and location is very attractive. We took the airport shuttle to the hotel and it only took us about 20 mins for the transportation. It is very convenient.Not as what we read from the previous preview, the front desk agent actually gave us a friendly welcome and we have a newly renovated room. I like the bathroom as it was very new and clean. The room is ok. I like it very bright with sunlight. The hotel provided free internet access which is good for my boyfriend as he can check his stock from time to time. There is not much TV channels but we actually don't really care as we spend most of our time site seeing and shopping. The lift is a little old but I think it is classic as I have never ride this kind of lift before. Location is the best!!I really like the location of the hotel as it is very close to most of the places that we wanted to go. Union Square, Chinatown, San Francisco shopping mall are minutes away. We took the cable car to Fisherman's Walf which the cable car station is just at the corner. I love the ice-cream sundae at Ghirardelli Square**The overall stay at Spaulding Hotel is ok and comfortable and I recommanded to couples like us who loves shopping and site seeing. We met some business travelers going to the convention staying at Spaulding Hotel as well. I believe it is good for business travelers also.**

<Content>Learn from our mistakes! I suppose you can say that my husband and I didn't actually stay at the spaulding hotel. We checked in, left our bags and went out as fast as possible. We aren't fussy travellers and did not expect much for the money that we were paying, but this place had to be a joke. The place was dingy, dirty, and had rather disgusting furniture. The widow opened to a cement wall and there were wires hanging out of an inside wall, which were possibly once attached to a fire alarm. There was no phone, presumably so you could not call anyone to tell them how crap the place was. To top it off, the door to the room didn't even shut or lock properly. Scary since there was a man wandering the halls, appearing to be strung out on drugs. As I said, we didn't actually stay there because after we came to our senses we ran back to the hotel, got our bags and booked at one of the only available hotels, costing another 180 dollars which was worth EVERY penny. Never again will we make the same mistake.

My bf was actually the one who booked the hotel and since they still have an available room last weekend, he grabbed it thinking that this hotel would be alright since it is near union square......well we were in for a BIG surprise.... yes it was a budget hotel but you would realLy wonder if they have housekeeping!!! THE ROOM STINKS!!!! DIRTY of course... such deceiving pictures....the picture of the room posted there was the only 1 cleaned (??? ) I guess....Reception agent acts like a security guard... I'm not really sure if they speak english...Heater does not work. We told reception about it but still the same.... no action done...No phone inside room ( what kind of hotel is this? )NO REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE TV ( Would you believe this!!!!, I thought my bf was kidding when he told me this... )tHE BATHROOM STINKS TOO... Takes a LOOOONG time for water to heat up.You would be easily disturbed by noise from all over... its like staying at a CARDBOARD hotel. I don't have to say but I want to say that we were SO DISAPPOINTED... Please if you would like to enjoy SFO, keep offSpaulding Hotel.....

<Content>Do Not Stay! I wish I had read the reviews before we went! We had a 4 week holiday in USA  Mexico (with a budget of about $100 per night) and this is the only place I am giving a bad review to so that explains how poor it was. I don't believe our room had been serviced when we arrived as someone's comb and loose change was still on the table along with the bed covering folded up ( on the table). I suspect the bed hadn't been changed. There was only one towel for both of us and no telephone to request another. When I went to reception and requested an extra pillow and towel I was told it wasn't possible as she couldn't leave the desk. We never did get our requests and stayed 2 more nights. Breakfast was a paper cup of coffee and pastry next door. I didn't realize I wasn't allowed to use a china cup so my coffee was taken off me and poured out and I was made to use the paper cups. Talk about feel like second class! On check out we weren't even spoken to, we might as well not have been standing there, he didn't even look up from his computer. They then had the cheek to send us an email asking what we thought! Location is good but spend and extra $20 and stay somewhere else as this place is the pits.

<Content>Central location The Spaulding was fine for the money. It was clean and comfortable, right in the centre of the CBD if thats where you want to be. If I had my time again I would probably stay near Fishermans wharf since it is a nicer looking area but Spaulding is definately a central hotel and the cable car is just down the road. One thing they could improve on was breakfast. You got a coupon which you could use in the restaurant next door to get a tea or coffee and donut or bagel. I wouldnt really call that a breakfast. But it was free so I guess you can't really complain!

<Content>Good crash pad Really convenient location. Small hotel close to Union Square. Great if you only need a place to sleep, shower and stash your stuff. Clean with a private bath. No air conditioning, cable TV, in room telephones or alarm clocks, but that's OK if you know in advance and don't visit during a heat wave.

<Content>adequate, you get what you pay for! This is a bare bones hotel. We spent two nights in the updated room. It was clean , everything worked and we had a view of O'farrell St. The good points are; the hotel is very close to BART and one block from cable car, you can hear it go by, which I thought was very cool. If you want to spend time in your hotel or expect perfection this is not the one for you, But if you want a place to sleep, shower (lots of hot water and very even temps) and to keep your stuff safe, this is the place. Breakfast was a donut or begal and coffee or tea. We checked out and left our bags for seven hours at the front desk. I would like to add there are some people staying at the hotel who appear to actually reside there, Possibly, begining to reenter mainstream society? They were polite but not polished.

<Content>Don't Be fooled! My friend and I initially booked this hotel for the great price and good reviews from other travellers. Unfortunately between the time we booked and the time we arrived it had obviously gone down hill.We initially had our intended stay for 6 nights but only stayed for one. We would of left that night except for the fact we had a late flight into San Francisco and it is very hard getting a hotel at 11pm.The lobby/reception is clean and nice looking but when you venture further you discover that it is not all that nice.We requested a non-smoking room with two double beds and fridge. We got a room with a single bed and bunk bed and no fridge in the room but that wasn't the main problem. The bed linen was dirty. The bathroom, disgusting with stains in the bath/shower. The room smelt (as did the corridor/floor to get to the room). I wanted to gag! The tv had graffiti etched into it and if you wanted a view outside your window, I hope you like brickwalls.When we went downstairs to the reception desk we were told that there were no other rooms available. When we asked why we didn't get the room we paid for we were told we would have to speak to management. (Management was a no show- even the next morning).We roughed it for the one night sleeping on top of the covers. It was a cold night but we didn't put on the heater due to the state of it we feared we would blow ourselves up!We felt totally unsafe here. We could hear all the noise and yelling from the rooms around us. We slept with the light on.Warning - Forget the advertisements that it is in union square , this hotel is on the edge of the Tenderloin area - unsafe area known for the drug addicts etc.Unless by some miracle you get a refurnished room (which is what we expected) I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Even if you got a nice room, I'd still have doubts staying here.Other points: There is one elevator that is very old and slow and be prepared to share it with cockroaches.There is no telephone in the room.No electronic keys

<Content>Never again. The best thing this hotel has is its location and they know it, this is the only way I can explain they are still in business. The staff is unexperienced, and rude; there is only one person at the front desk (that is when there is actually one at all)I arrived one hour after the check in time and the room was not ready yet, I had to wait for another hour because the maid was too busy. When I finally made it to my room the linens were dirty with every kind of stains and hairs you can imagine. I had to request new linens but the maid refused to change the pillow cases because she had forgotten them, she got very upset when I told them changing them the next day was not an option.The internet connection is awful, most of the times is not working and eventhough this can be solved by resetting the modem, there is only one guy who can do it and he will only do it if you insist a lot.If you are planning an extended stay here, do not bother on paying for cleaning service, the maids will only clean your room when they feel like doing it and they cannot even do the bed on a decent way.The thing that shocked me the most happenned the last day when I tried to check out. It was about 5am and the desk was unattended and the doors unlocked, and it lasted like that for at lest 20 minutes until I was able to wake the person in charge up. ANYONE on probably the most unsafe neighbourhood of the city can get into the hotel at early hours of the morning.Other things I think people should know are:-There is only one elevator, and it is stinky, small, old and very slow.-There is no phone not cable TV in rooms.-The building is old and the floors squeaky.-You might have to share your room with cockroaches as I did.-There are no electronic keys.I have been in budget hotels before but this one should not even be called hotel. I would have changed somewhere else but with Memorial Day around those days every hotel in the area was full but this one, now I know why...

<Content>Scared I stayed with my wife at this hotel and it was really disgusted. There were fleas in the bed; the water pressure in the shower was ridiculous you could count the number of water drops/minutes, the bathroom was too old and dirty. There was no telephones in the room, no air conditioner (I couldn't sleep in the warmer day)and no wireless. The hotel web site doesn't give you the really impression from the rooms. I got budget hotels in San Diego and Los Angeles during my trip but this one made me scared. Try another budget option, trust me.

<Content>There's pro's and cons ... Where do I start. First off, booking the hotel was a very easy process, and I called in advance to get a room with wi-fi. The guy down at the front desk was really cool and very helpful. I wish the room was as pleasant.The location is unbeatable - Union Square is right around the corner about a half block away. Everything is literally right outside - great if you take public transport and are doing shopping. Okay, so the pro's thus far were the booking, guy at front desk, and location.I got to my room and was a bit dissapointed. The room had a decent bed - no problem there. It was very small, and quite dark. I had a room which had a window which opened to an alley. You could clearly hear people talking in the building next door (they obviously had windows open) - the neighboring build was that close.There is no phone in the room - that was a major problem for me in particular - although I am going to be getting a mobile phone anyways tomorrow. There was a heater, and a ceiling fan (which you absolutely need in the Bay Area in May), but no A/C (I could live without that). So, the room was very unimpressive - the chair was nearly a plastic one. The bathroom was okay, but there were no regular sized towels provided (odd, considering there was a floor towel, and two small face cloths). There was no iron or dryer in the room, and of course no fridge or microwave. The room and the hotel in general had an odd odor.So, it is basically a place to sleep, that's it. The sad part is that given it's location it could be so much more - very,very easily, in fact. It could be much more profitable as well. I have to wonder about the current owners. Even if it is lower budget, it can be improved with very minor things which willpay for itself in more people being booked and easily charging higher rates.

<Content>Great location and price I spent three nights here on first landing in San Francisco. Located right by Union Square, cable cars and the metro, it was a great base for exploring the city.It's not spectacular in terms of decor but it's clean, the staff are friendly and helpful and, lets face it, it's hardly an expensive hotel - what more do you expect for the price.The hotel seems to be in the process of being refurbished and some rooms are nicer than others. After spending 3 weeks travelling around the west coast of the USA I returned to San Francisco to fly home and checked back into the Spaulding for my final night.My first room was on the third floor at the front of the building and quite noisy. The second was on the seventh floor at the rear of the building and was much quieter.

<Content>Bed Bugs!!!!! Good location, good price, but that's about it. As lots of other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel smelt bad - not our room though luckily, just the corridors. Seemed relatively clean, but the bathroom was a bit grotty - paint peeling off and just really old looking. And then.... we got bitten by bed bugs, so would definitely not recommend this place unless you're immune to these pests!!

<Content>Location, location, location!! Booked a room on the weekend of the Bluegrass Festival, fleet week, and various other festivals. The city was packed, no rooms to be had. 90.00 a night was right in my budget instead of the 350.00+ a night at neighboring hotels, which were also booked up. It was what I expected. Clean and no nonsense. They had a nice little doughnut and coffee thing going on in the lobby in the morning. If you want a romantic weekend in the city, this is not the hotel for you. But if you are interested in a great location, an ok room with not a frill to be had. Don't be afraid to book this hotel. With a little paint, nicer curtains an upgrade in towels and bedding, throw in a couple of tacky paintings, this hotel could charge much more. Gigi

<Content>Great disappointment with Spaulding! Greatly disappointed with Spaulding Hotel. Was the worst lodging I had when I was travelling USA for 14 days. Paid $76 per night for 3 nights and there was a weird smell when I entered the hotel. In fact, the whole hotel had this weird smell. The front desk guy gave us a room on the 3rd floor initially which I felt terribly cheated when I entered the room. It was SMALL, DIRTY, DARK and OLD. This looked different from the photos shown on the hotel's website when I first booked it. Was terribly upset and went down to confront the front desk guy. I told him the room looked totally different from what was advertised and it was really not acceptable. He then gave us another room on the 7th floor for us to see if we liked it. It looked much better than the first room he gave us. Brighter and slightly bigger, at least. We had no choice but to accept it. We kept thinking that the hotel cheated us by giving us a smaller room without informing us although the price we paid for was for a bigger room. This left a really bad impression that the hotel was not honest in doing business.If i was in San Francisco again, I will never choose to stay in this hotel again. We had 3 luggages to move in and the rooms were situated far away from the lift where we had to struggle through 2 doors before reaching our room. It was great inconvenience! Although the location is in Union Square, there are certainly better hotels in the vicinity that although slightly more expensive, are more worth your consideration! Don't make a choice I regretted.

<Content>Reserve is not guranteed. Mind you ! I online reserve a room at Spaulding for 6 days, and got the confirmation email etc. But I went there, they told me they have no available room, and they divert me to their sister hotel - Parking. I walk my way there, take 20min for first timer, carrying my huge baggage. However, the Parking can only offer me first 4 night stays, well, what can i say? It is not Parking's fault however.My first day of holiday is spoilt, and i have to look around for cheap hotel to stay for last 2 nights. Cheap price come with low quality - i can accept that. But I cant torelate somebody do bussiness without basic moral, especially hotel bussiness.Mind you, if you really want to reserve this hotel, better call them up few days or even weeks to make sure they really reserve your reservation.

<Content>Crack House I know I stayed in the economy room, but I still expected something nicer. Soon as I walked in I started crying because it was so gross. I wouldn't let the blankets touch me and I found a container of pills under my bed. I had a tough time sleeping in fear of my window with it's busted open lock. I was going to stay there for 3 nights, but just left the next day. If you stay here don't get an economy room. You're better off getting a single hostel room that's right around the corner from this hotel.

<Content>Spaulding Hotel is Fine I don't know what the previous posters expected, but given the price the Spaulding Hotel was just as I expected - except the location was even better than I thought. The bulding is old but has character and it looks like the hotel is making improvements. I did not notice any bad smells. I looked at other hotels around the area and couldn't find anything under $110. I consider myself an independent/budget traveller. I don't go to a city to spend a lot of time in a hotel room so all I need is a clean, safe and well located hotel. I prefer to save money on the hotel to spend on other things. The Spaulding was exactly what I was looking for. I have definately paid more for worse hotels. As long as you aren't expecting the Ritz and you want to be in the center of all the action, then the Spaulding is a good option for the price. By the way, make sure you ask for a renovated room - at first I was given a non-renovated room that was a little tired but ok, but the renovated room was perfect.
