<Content>Overpriced and annoying Directions for the shuttle from the airport were inadequate. Upon arrival the hotel had messed up my reservation. Right number, wrong person. I was then treated with a kind of stiff, polite arrogance. Naturally the screwup was my fault, even though I had a valid reservation number. We finally got things sorted out, but not without a further helping of arrogance. The room telephone was on the fritz, and the hotel's wireless access ranged from poor to non-existent. The sit-down restaurants are all rather pricey, and the lobby cafe hardly appeared to be used. No servers in sight. Room service consisted of a 17.50 Euro cheeseburger, preferable to a 20 Euro club sandwich. A 50cl bottle of beer was 5.50 Euro. I skipped breakfast because I didn't want to spend another 20 Euro. .

<Content>Great hotel,, Convenient to the airport I stayed here for one night in order to catch an early morning flight. The hotel did not receive my reservation from their online system, so I was upgraded to an Executive Tower room. The room looked like it had recently been remodeled. It was very modern, clean and comfortable. The shuttle service to and from the airport was easy -it runs every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. Overall I would recommend this hotel for its comfort and convenience to the airport.

<Content>Great Sleepover at Franfurt Airport Living on the west coast, we usually approach Europe via the polar route to Frankfurt (a ten or eleven hour flight) and stop in Frankfurt to get a good night's sleep before continuing to our destination (Greece or Italy in recent years). Most commonly we have simply stayed right at the Frankfurt Airport in the Sheraton. It is very expensive but right in the airport. It cannot be beat for comfort and convenience. However this year we opted to try another hotel, 5 minutes by taxi or van from the airport--The Steigenberger Airport Hotel. It was half the price of the Sheraton, and fully as comfortable. Down pillows and duvets, beautiful modern bathroom, spacious room. And best of all there was a wonderful restaurant attached to the hotel. Not one of those generic hotel restaurants, but a great classic German restaurant, the Unterschweinstiege, housed in a beautiful old building separate from the hotel proper. We had an unforgettable meal there.The next morning the hotel van returned us to the airport and we were on our way again. We will make this excellent hotel our regular stopover from this point on.Caution!! there are three Steigenberger hotels in the Frankfurt area. Be sure you book the one at the airport. We have stayed at the Steigenberger Hof in Frankfurt city, and do not recommend it. There is also one at the train station in Frankfurt, but we have not tried it.

<Content>great......again Decided to return to this hotel after spending a unexpected night in 2004 when we missed our connecting flight back to Canada.I am happy to report that my stay was equally as pleasant.I had booked through the online website for the special rate of 102Euros/night. After a long transatlantic flight, it is close to the airport and worked out to be a great place to crash before resuming the rest of our tour of Germany. The free shuttle from the airport is frequent and easy to find.Our room was on the second floor and was a great basic double room. Clean, functional, comfortable and quiet. We didn't get the chance to use the pool/sauna area, but we went up and had a look around and it looked nice.The main reason for our return was the restaurant that is attached to the hotel Restaurant Unterschweinstiege. An excellent authentic German restaurant. A bit pricey, but worth every penny. You must try the draft beer......it is worth the trip to Germany itself. We enjoyed the Sunday evening buffet which allowed us to try many different dishes. The service is excellent. And you must check out the cool bathroom!!I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a hotel close to the airport, or someone like myself who has had a long journey and needs a place to refuel before moving on.Great job (again) Steigenberger!

This is very close : 10 minutes with the bus shuttle of the hotel, which is free of charge and very frequent.Then, the room are very nice. I was upgraded in a suite. It was very very nice and unexpected since it was my first stay in this hotel.Breakfast is nice, great hoice.I can recommend this hotel for business stay without any reservation. I was impressed.

<Content>Decent Airport Hotel - Nuff Said Sheraton rates were so inflated - I mean really, really inflated - so I opted for the Steinberger as an alternative. I had a single room which typically means closet in Europe, however I was coming off a whirlwind busines trip with lots of driving and was ready to drop off the rental and sleep anyway. Shuttle was easy to find and got me directly to location with no issues and in a timely fashion. No problems with check in. Passed through the huge lobby which appeared to have some kind of travel scene  which I had no interest in partaking. Room was indeed tiny but well laid out. Took some time to figure out light situation - duh, put key in wall upon entering. Never did figure out how to turn off certain lights so just pulled the key out prior to going asleep. Ordered a decent and not overly expensive room service dinner. Simple menu. Service was timely and no issue with the food. Bed was comfortable so accomplished a good night's sleep which was my primary objective. Breakfast came with room rate but I opted to get some extra sleep prior to hopping on shuttle to check in for my flight. No muss, no fuss. No complaints for this hotel.

<Content>Clean  The Steigenberger is a large hotel situated in the Frankfurt Airport complex, just 5 minutes from the airport itself.You are greeted by a door man and shown to reception where you are welcomed in perfect English and checked in quickly and efficiently.On the ground floor are a numberof places to eat. I ate in the Faces bar which served food until 01:00 ideal because I'd arrived late. It is the usual hamburger, curry and steak affair. Reasonably priced and good quality.The Five Continents served an excellent selection for breakfast the following day including cooked items, colds meats and cheeses, breads, cereals, fruits and yoghurts. My only complaint was that there was only UHT milk for tea and coffee.Colleagues used the gym and pool although I did not have time. the hotel also has plently of parking in an adjacent block.The hotel itself is huge. The public areas are marble downstairs and reminiscent of a shopping centre. Very clean but rather clinical. Upstairs, again clean and tidy. No complaints, just a standard large hotel style and feel.My room was 913 on the 9th floor. This was a 'superior' room but was actually just a standard hotel room, a little small but there was a desk, tv, mini bar and plenty of hanging and storage space if required. The room was freshly decorated, crisp clean linen on a comfortable bed. I had a nice view of the runway but apart from a few noisy aircraft was not particularly concerned by the air traffic. The room had airconditioning which meant that I could keep the windows closed.The bathroom was sleek and modern, nice hot shower and good quality towels and toiletries.I enjoyed a very comfortable trouble free stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a stopover in Frankfurt.

<Content>Great if you want to be close to the airport Used this hotel a few times now when working at FRA airport. You can walk from T2 to this hotel or take the courtesy bus if you have lots of luggage. The restaurant and bar downstairs are good value, the spa area has sauna, steam room, pool and solaruim. There is an outdoor area in the sauna room where you can cool off. Links to the city can be found in the terminal where the train station is.

<Content>Reasonably good...but not great I stayed here for 2 nights during a business trck across Europe. Overall, i thought the hotel was okay. The rooms were nicely appointed and clean. I stayed in a deluxe room (rain shower) but not the executive tower. The service was mediocre. One of the three elevators was broken the entire time I was there--resulting in up to a 10 minute wait. Not the end of the world but pretty lame. The breakfast was pretty good. If you need to stay near the airport and don't want to deal with the Sheraton which is more expensive and noisy, this is is a solid choice.

<Content>Nice Airport Hotel Very nice overnight stay at the Steigenberger. I was in the Executive Tower, with a very nice room, comfortable bed and great shower. Breakfast was about average for a hotel like this.The free shuttle to Frankfurt Airport runs 24 hrs a day and takes less than 10 minutes, making it easy to get on the S-Bahn to go to either downtown Mainz or Frankfurt or a variety of other locations.This is definitly a good value for an airport hotel. It's not as convienient as a hotel that is actually in the airport, but the location off site makes it nice and quiet - the rooms are extremely well insulated.

<Content>Nice, clean, standard room for overnighting Had to spend a day in Frankfurt on while traveling on business, and this hotel was quite sufficient. The room was very clean, quiet, and had a nice bathroom. You can't walk anywhere from here, but there is frequent shuttle service to the airport where you can jump on the train and head into town. The bar is very nice, a restaurant with some kind of German/Bavarian theme was only so-so. Meal was free, so I guess I can't complain too much. Staff wasn't over friendly or helpful in suggesting things to do, maybe because there isn't much to do in Frankfurt, I don't know. But they weren't rude, just seemed indifferent. The hotel was suggested by some airline staff in the States, probably because the convenience to the airport and nice bar. I'd stay again if for business travel.

<Content>Mixed reviews First the positives:Great location.Good food.Excellent pillowsnicely appointed roomsThe negatives:1. I ended up spending over 300 euroes for a one night stay, but the get internet access, just to print my boarding pass, it cost 3 euros. On the lobby computer, you had to provide credit card info accept the 3 euro charge to your credit card, then they email you the login and password, but I couldn't retrieve it because I couldn't logon to access my email. When I complained at the front desk, to the manager, she gave me a wink, suggest I fill out a complaint form, assured me there was nothing they could do, but did volunteer that management was complicit in the scheme.2. I has booked the room almost a year in advance by email, recdeived a confirmation, yet when I checked in, they told me it was cancelled because I didn't provide any credit card info, which I gladly would have done if asked.3. I has booked a king size bed(I had my wife with me), the first room they gave me was a single, then I got a queen, I was too tired to argue the point.The front desk staff are useless.

<Content>An Amazing Airport Hotel We have stayed at this hotel everytime we have to overnight in Frankfurt. It is only 1 km from the airport, but borders on a forest with lovely hiking/biking trails. We take walks at every opportunity - the perfect antidote to long flights. The newer Executive Tower overlooks the forest - and even with the window open (our preference), we don't hear any airport noise. The rooms have a very contempory, clean, sleek styling with some very well thought-out touches....like: a window so you can watch the TV while taking a shower - and of course there is a TV volume control in the shower. The airport shuttle is frequent and easy, and big enough to take 2 big bicycles wrapped in plastic. The staff is professional and friendly. It is a 4 star airport hotel - and the prices reflect that but of all the airport hotels in Frankfurt, this one is the best!

<Content>Avoid this place like the plague! This is the third time I've stayed here, spending the night to catch a 'plane early the next morning. Three times and they're out.(1) There are two Steigenberger Airport Hotels. The busses that take you to them are staffed by nice guys who have no idea which hotel you are going to. I had no idea there were two hotels with the same name. I found out as I went about 15 miles away to a very nice country hotel, not mine. 30 euros later I was at the correct hotel. No one would accept responsibility for the mix-up. No one would reimburse me for the taxi ride. Everyone agreed that it was confusing that there were two hotels with the same name, but I was told you should know where you are going. I tried repeatedly with the Manager to express my frustration -- no one would have known. I was told by a waitress that this happens quite often. The manager was rude and frankly insulting, insinuating that I was stupid.(2) I was assigned a room but when I got to my floor it did not exist. I went back downstairs and the receptionists (who had witnessed my conversation with the Manager) were giggling. They hadn't told me I had to go to a different elevator bank. I asked why and was told you didn't ask. They stood there and watched me go up the WRONG elevator.(3) I was starving but the lobby restaurant was packed and couldn't serve me right away. I went to the other hotel restaurant because it had a buffet line. BIG MISTAKE. The food was the worst I have ever had in my life. Worse than the worse institutional food I've seen. I ate what I could and consumed a lot of bread. The meats were disgusting, the vegetables were soft and watery, the fish tasted off and the cold salads were not cold. On top of this a bottle of water cost 8 euros.(4) I asked for 7.30 wakeup call. I awoke at 7.40. I called downstairs, thinking my watch was off. They insisted I did not ask for a wakeup call. Of course I did. I took a shower and at 8.00 the phone rang, my wake-up call.(5) Checking out I asked for the United Airlines terminal. I was directed to one of two busses. I asked the receptionist twice about it and she insisted I know what I am talking about. I asked the driver but he did not speak one word of English. No one on the bus had a clue. We went to the WRONG terminal. I had to find a shuttle bus and take it to the other terminal, a far distance. Fortunately I had enough time.This hotel has a GREAT location but frankly the staff is so incompetent and rude that I'll not again stay here. A pity for them. I control where my staff (20 people) stays in FRA, and I can tell you it will never be at Steigenberger Airport Hotel again. EVER. AVOID THE PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.

<Content>Hotel or HOSTEL??!? For a family to stay for the night.... NOT IMPRESSED! No Extras here!!!......The reception, pool and restaurant areas were impressive but then you are escorted up to your Room which was more like a closet..We checked in on May 2nd for the night before flying out the next morning. The proximity to the airport, fine, shuttle service, fine.... but our room was left with No towels, soap or even glasses.......Went to use the pool, and found out that they charge 5 bucks per person to use a robe. GIVE ME A BREAK!!! 10 bucks to use the internet. and No breakfast!Talk about gouging the average Joe here! For 200 bucks a night, it would have been practical...for us to stay in a hotel, further from the airport, with more inviting accommodations!Not recommended to stay here.... unless you enjoy paying for nothing!

<Content>Perfect as a layover place After a difficult trip I needed a place to rest and chill during a layover in Frankfurt on my way back to LA. I made a reservation on the same day right at the airport. Steigenberger was exactly what I needed. A convinient airport business hotel. Easy access from airport (24 hour free shuttle that runs every 15 minutes - no calls, no reservations). Nice clean room. Not large, but plenty adequate. Very nice gym with a view, a pool, and a sauna with various rooms. Nice bar for a beer and pizza. Business center with internet access (5 euros for 1 hour). In short, perfect layover hotel if you just want to relax and recover.

<Content>Very ordinary hotel Start with messing up the booking and taking 30 minutes to fix it.The rooms are average. I paid 30 Euro to upgrade my room. I'd hate to see tyhe standard rooms.Beware the add on charges They lend you nothing. An Internmational plug (normally commonplace these days in International Airport upscale hotels) 11 Euro. The wireless internet did not work. They attempted to charge me 5.5 Euro until I kicked upo a stink.Beware the drink and food prices in the Lobby Bar. They are rediculous.I would definitely recommend you look elsewhere for Hotel accomodation at Frankfurt Airport. I'll be trying the Sheraton at the Airport in future

<Content>Mediocre for 200鈧? Incredibly stingy /cheap/low class management policy I really expect more out of a hotel (yes, even an Airport Hotel) where the cheapest single, overnight rate is 200鈧? breakfast excluded. More than a tiny room, More than a mediocre breakfast that cost 25鈧? Certainly more than having to PAY for what is, in every other hotel I've EVER stayed in worldwide, a simple, complementary disposable shaving set.I wouldn't be surprised if they start charging for the quantity of cubic meters of air breathed while in the hotel!!This is one place I'll never stay in again. Maybe this is a good way to manage a fast-food chain, where even an extra scahet of ketchup or an extra napking gets charged. Not a 5 star hotel (I can't imagine this hotel being 5 stars by even the lowliest standards.

<Content>Well, it is an airport hotel My fiance and I arrived at this hotel after 1 week in Baden Baden to be able to relax before our respective flights home the next day.The hotel worked as intended for that purpose.The courtesy bus was defintely usefull and my fiance loved the restaraunt in the rear of the hotel because they had German folk music playing. She even asked the musicians if they had a CD she could buy.. Unfortunately not. )-:The breakfast the next morning was included in our rate and was excellent. A great finish to our Germany adventure.Room design and space was ok. Was disappointed there was no bath but I loved the design of the shower with the large overhead outlet.Internet prices were very expensive and both my fiance and I noted there were no public telephones either in the foyer or nearby.

<Content>much better than I had expected This place was really a surprise for me. I had just come from London and been offered a bed there at E 550 when here I paid E 105 only a few minutes from my terminal and very comfortable. Reception was exceptionably personable both on check-in and check-out - really could not have been nicer without raising suspicion of their intentions. Arriving late, I went straight to the bar for a snack and a drink and was treated to the warmest service that you could hardly expect in a hotel populaced by blow-throughs. Well you don't want to get stuck in an airport hotel anytime but this was really quite pleasant.Only gripe is that where most hotels provide a bunch of cosmetics, shampoo, body lotion, shower cap etc. which I don't need, here there were none, whilst my luggage had headed off on an independant route of it's own, and for once I was in dire need ! So pretty good, all in all, but none-the-less pleased to continue my journey to the intended destination.;

<Content>Great Service, Great Location, Adequate rooms A great location, less than 1 kilometer from the airport, with free shuttle to the airport from both Frankfurt Terminals. The front desk staff was polite and quick at check-in and attentive to every detail.Once in the room it is apparent that the furnishings, though of good quality, are similar to most German hotel rooms and the size is equal to many that are one half the cost. The rooms have double windows to keep out the noise of the planes, although the outer window in my room was missing a handle that would have allowed it to be closed completely. The maintenance staff had left for the day and the operator did offer me a new room.The indoor pool located on the top (9th) floor was great and there are saunas and massages available as well.There are three dining locations located on the premises and each offer a different ambiance and menu selection.If you need to be close to the airport and are looking for a clean, quiet selection this hotel is a good choice.

<Content>For Airport Travelers Only - Otherwise Go Elsewhere. I had certain pre-conceived ideas about what it would be like to stay here for our the 1 night we had to due to timing issues on our flight back to the U.S. Most all of my preconceptions were right...so I guess you might say my disappointment was expected, but I was hopeful going in.Airport shuttle to/from airport is very frequent, easy to find, clean, and fast...gets you right there. Hotel told me it runs every 15 minutes.Hotel itself is in a business park and actually pretty nice. Absolutely nothing around it...so you don't stay here unless you are looking for a bed close to the airport.There are LOTS of people that work here...except for the restaurant staff, all are somewhat aloof...but then they ARE Europeans!Room was VERY hot/stuffy when we got in there. Turned on the A/C full blast and it never did cool down the whole night. You can't open the windows either. Called front desk to ask about A/C...they said to wait awhile that it was normal. Next day at checkout, told mgr. about it. He asked why I didn't switch rooms...I could have slapped him! I told him I called down and was told it was normal. He said that isn't true that I COULD have had another room...so it was my fault. They refused to issue any kind of discount let alone refund for the room...but in great European style...he was of course sorry.TV choices in the room are awful...you would think they'd have more than a couple English channels....but nope!Best thing about the hotel was the cold beer, burger, and fries at the bar restaurant. Sure it was around $20.00, but a highlight of the hotel stay!Oh yeah...smoke is EVERYWHERE in the hotel. I think it must be a requirement or something that everyone smoke everywhere as much as possible.So why did I rate it a 3 on TripAdvisor? Because they met my lowered expectations of an over-priced average room w/ semi-bad customer service...but they DID get me to and from the airport as needed...which is why we were there in the first place.

<Content>Great nights sleep before flight home My husband and I stayed here before a flight back to the US. The price was very reasonable because we got a weekend rate. The hotel was lovely but the food was VERY expensive; they have a captive audience. There was no free internet in the lobby as many other large hotels had but since it is an airport hotel they don't offer much without a fee. The shuttle to the airport leaves every 15 minutes and was very timely. Great hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel! I had the (mis)fortune to stay at this hotel when my connecting flight from Frankfurt was cancelled. After a day full of trouble I was just looking for a hotel that's convenient to the airport and got myself booked into the Steigenberger, expecting a nice clean hotel but not much else.I was in for a big surprise. The hotel is accessible from the airport by 24h shuttle bus, which runs to/from both terminals. It is very spacious with all the facilities you can think of. Swimming pool, gym, massage etc. The rooms are a good size, furnished to a high standard and well maintained.There are smoking and non-smoking rooms, or floors, I'm not sure which, but I'm sure that would appeal to both. As a non-smoker I was glad that I didn't have to deal with the smell of cigarettes from the previous occupant.Since my luggage was lost at the airport I had no toothbrush or razor, and the staff were friendly and helpful and provided me with a shaving kit and a dental care kit, which at that stage I would have killed for.The following morning the breakfast lived up to the high standard of the hotel, there's a massive selection of fresh fruit, meats, pastries, omelettes and various hot dishes, even sparkling wine for those who are that way inclined.During my short stay I was really impressed by the hotel and the staff and I'm only sorry that I couldn't stay there for longer.

<Content>Steigenberger is overpriced but good location I was expecting the Steigenberger to be a true 4 star hotel, but was sorely dissapointed with nearly everything. They gave me a room in the old tower, it was very outdated and quite possibly the worst bed I've ever slept in at any hotel. It was hard and the linens were cheap. The desk clerks were rude and the lobby bar was a dreadful place to be with impersonable service from every staff member. The only good thing about this hotel is the shuttle service to the airport which was very efficient. Other than that, I can't recommend this hotel unless you pay less than 80 Euros and require a hotel near the airport. Otherwise, stay in the Frankfurt Marriott, where you will receive much better service for your Euro. This hotel should be downgraded to a 2.5* property as the 4* rating is very misleading.

<Content>The best airport hotel I ever stayed at The hotel is a short bus ride from the terminal. The bus leaves every 15 minutes, 24 hours. Room rate was reasonable and my room very comfortable. The lobby bar is lively and with good service, the breakfast buffet had all you could wish for, including a friendly staff. Staying at this hotel is hereby highly recommended and certainly a better alternative than the Sheraton located next to the airport terminal.

<Content>Untrained Staff and bad food Stayed at the Steigenberger at the Frankfurt Airport for a night prior to an early flight the next day. To begin with, the hotel does not offer valet service so we had to park our car ourselves in the car park (about 10 minute walk). Upon check-in we had left our luggage with the receptionist who was supposed to take it to our rooms. When we got back from the car park, we could not enter our rooms. Turned out, the concierge had brought the luggage to our rooms, issuing new keys, thus voiding the key given to us upon check-in. Once in the room, the minibar keys were missing. After contacting room service they eventually brought the key to the room whereas the receptionist was supposed to hand over the keys upon check-in. We then had dinner at the Connexion restaurant. Service was slow and the food was well below average. The meat was dry and the vegetables nearly raw. The salad looked like it had been sitting on the side for a few days. The rooms were clean and so where the bathrooms, both in good condition. We previously stayed at the Sheraton Airport and I would definitely return since it provides far better facilities and service compare to the Steigenberger.

<Content>Loved It We used this as a stop over hotel for our trip to the Bahamas from Manchester UK.We were really impressed with the room - which for some reason was in the Business Suite. Very very clean. Bathroom spotless. Bed clean linen - excellant. What a lovelly sleep we had that night.Reception great - with English speaking. Breakfast was fantastic. Not what I have been used to on the continent in the past. Very high quality food and good service.Had a meal on the night - awsome steak - a bit pricey but worth every euro. Bus every 15 minutes to airport again complimentary and clean.Will definately use this when stopping over at Frankfusrt airport in the future.

<Content>Airport hotel with smoke ventilation issue At the end of our 9 day German visit we wanted an easy last night to catch our early US flight in the morning. We saw the Sheraton at the airport but *that* didn't seem very German! So we headed to the more Teutonic sounding Steigenberger. The friendly desk clerk offered a corporate rate of $140, which I suspected was about as good as I could expect at the airport. I requested a non-smoking room with large bed for my wife and I.When we got to our room we found that it was obviously a single with a single bed (i.e. the size of a small bunk), with only a single bath towel. There was no floor space to speak of...I estimate the room at about 200 sq ft and the bed at 18 sq ft. I called the desk to request a room suitable for two persons. They offered a smoking room with a king, with the caveat that if the smell was too strong they could come to spray something.I have lived in hotel rooms since 1979. I've never had a room so filled with cigarette stench that it bothered me. I accepted the new assignment, room #550.After a 10-15 minute wait a bellman brought us a new key and we headed to #550. Upon entering we found a king bed room with double the space as the last one. We settled in and immediately both of us noticed the smell of fresh cigarette smoke. Seriously, it was as if someone was under our bed going through a pack of Gitanes!We smelled under the door to the connecting room and in the bath and couldn't identify the source. My wife prepared for dinner and I read, annoyed by the intense, yet mysterious smell of smoke. Finally I concluded that it was beyond tolerable.Any reader who has ever sent back a dish in a restaurant will identify with my dilemma. If you send back a dish it makes it very difficult to complain a second time! Here, we had already changed rooms once because our first room was impossibly small with inadequate linen. The windows were secured by special locks, so I called housekeeping to open them. They arrived with a special hex-key and did so. We opened the windows wide onto the 40 degree cool night expecting that to rid our room of any stench of smoke.Dinner in the Unterschwienstiege was a very nice buffet...which cost about $114 for self-serve dishes and three beers. Pricey? There didn't seem to be any more economical option if we had salads with our meal. As we had come to expect in Germany, the restaurant smelled of smoke because the smoking section was only about 15 ft away.Upon returning to our (very cold) room we didn't smell any smoke. We closed the window most of the way and went to bed. Within minutes the room began to smell of fresh smoke. Again, it was like someone was under our bed puffing on a fresh smoke! It was a long, cool, night with our window open.We aren't anti-smoking fanatics. I spent five years in Asia and weeks in Egypt where cigarettes are a way of life. Yet, for some reason, this room was the worst...ever.I mentioned it to the uninterested cashier on checkout...I wasn't fishing for a discount nor did I get one...but I had hoped for a bit of concern because there was obviously a problem with the venting of this wing. No interest shown. So good luck to future guests...if you don't want smoke get a non-smoking room...as long as it's big enough for you.

<Content>Don't be fooled This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. Upon arriving in our room, we blew a fuse. I called the front desk to report the problem where I was berated for not knowing how to turn the lights on as there was a keybox to activate electricity. When I requested someone come up to assist us with the fuse, I could hear the clerk whisper how stupid we were that we could not turn on the lights. Additionally, the air conditioning was stuck in the on position (in December), the room was dirty, and only lukewarm water worked in the shower. The restaurant was ridiculously overpriced and there was an 8 Euro charge per person to use the sauna. The staff was rude and unhelpful. The only positive aspect of the hotel was the airport shuttle.

<Content>Very Good chain hotel We stayed there for a couple of nights between connecting flights. Because of long haul flights we just wanted to sleep and didn't mind that we didn't see much of the city. I thought it was a very good hotel: clean, efficient and quiet in a woodland setting. The rooms were a good size and while the decor was not to my taste it was very acceptable. My only complaint was the smell of smoke in the lifts and public areas. Also, there is no ATM on premises. The staff were helpful. There are restaurants and coffee shops which are attractive although we used them sparingly. Instead, we used the free shuttle to ferry us to and from the airport terminal where we found food, a pharmacy, post office, ATMs, reading material. From the airport you can get a train into Frankurt itself. The hotel is nice but very, very expensive (given the $A) and as it's a large, company hotel owned by Lufthansa it is full of airline staff and is rather impersonal. You wait quite a while for lifts/elevators. If you after local colour I guess it's self evident that you stay in Frankfurt proper.

<Content>great hotel stayed here for a layover on the way back to the states. very upscale business type hotel. very clean, staff was friendly and helpful. room amenities were great - slippers and robes, soaps, basket of fruit, mineral water. didnt eat at the reastaurants so unsure of quality there. the free shuttle to and from the airport runs every 15 minutes. overall, great stay.

<Content>Don't give credit card number Hotel was good but toileteries, coffee etc not kept in room as we find in american hotels. In these days of cabin baggage restrictions, toothpaste in room etc would have been good. But main concern was they took my credit card number saying thats the only way they can activate my room phone for a 3 minute free international call that they offered since my flight got delayed by a day in Germany. I used less than 3 minutes, since I timed it, but they charged me for it. When I checked out I asked the reception if there are any charges and they said No charges.

<Content>Needs a decorator, new carpet, and amenities. I don't expect much from airport hotels, just a quiet room and clean bathroom ... and that is almost what I got here. I have been disappointed in the hugely overbuilt Frankfurt Airport Sheraton in the past so I tried the Steigenberger Airport Hotel, which was less than half the inflated price of the former. No signs to the shuttle bus, but that is the airport's fault, I suppose. Quick check in with a reasonably friendly staff, who were, however, unable to confirm my flight for the next day, which was annoying as it turned out that the time had changed. The room was quiet. It was large enough to be comfortable, and it was reasonably clean ... except the carpet was woeful. The bathroom had no amenities except liquid soap. Cheap, that. The little pool (once I found it as the elevators are mislabeled) was clean, and a refreshing splash after a long flight was nice. There was one real surprise. The old dimly lit lobby restaurant/bar was not inviting, but I was hungry and the more pleasant German restaurant did not have much to offer a vegetarian, so I went in to the dispiriting place and found the food to be wonderful, and the staff attentive. This barn of a hotel would be nicer if they didn't park a car in the lobby. Has no one heard of decor?

<Content>Priceline calls this a four star!! The hotel rooms here are tiny, with a bathroom barely big enough to turn around in. No toiletries are provided, and there's no coffee in room. Even though we had booked and paid with priceline, we were required to provide credit card for mini-bar. But the mini-bar was locked! A person had to come unlock it for us. We ate at the Bistro restaurant in the lobby, as the cheapest dining option, and it wasn't cheap. The airport Sheraton includes breakfast for the four star price, but not Steigenberger. 21 Euro for breakfast. But the shuttle ran on time and efficiently, and it is located VERY close to the airport.

<Content>Shockingly worse than last time My wife and I were eager to return to this hotel after a wonderful overnight 2 years ago. Now- disappointment! good points - the excellent food at the Unterschweinstieg German restaurant. comfortable bed in a quiet room. However- the airport shuttle bus was bouncingly uncomfortable and the driver offered no help with our heavy luggage. Another traveller's luggage fell and just missed my wife's leg. The room we received was very small compared to last time and they told us we had received an upgrade. The business center access to internet was extremely user unfriendly and despite some help by front desk we could not get into the system so had to ask for our money ( 3 euro for 20 minutes) back. Breakfast buffett is again good but expensive ... no offer of a lower price for only continental (cold) selections. next time we will try for the Sheraton instead

<Content>5-Star...no way! We were recommended this hotel and one other by the friendly airport hotel desk. Since the price difference was only 8 euro, my husband asked the differences between the two. We were told the Steigenberger was a 5 star, closer to the airport and had a nice spa/pool area so that is what we chose. Similar to other reviews, we found the hotel staff to be extremely rude. The room was okay; the pool area average. The hotel is typical of any other airport hotel you鈥檇 find in the States. Nothing about this hotel warrants a 5-star rating. We also ate at the adjacent hotel buffet which was horrible and my husband let them know it. It still makes me sick to see the $89 charge on my credit card bill. It was a shame that was our last meal in Germany before returning to the home.The only positive thing about this hotel is the location and shuttle to the airport.

<Content>Just what we needed Arrived in Frankfurt after a disastrous encounter with Florence (Italy) airport. Tired, needed space to rearrange luggage etc. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Room was spacious, well-appointed, spotless and had everything we needed. Several good dining options. Quiet even though near airport. We highly recommend this hotel for an airport-based stop-over. Frequent shuttle is a bonus.

<Content>Check the Elevator First This hotel lacks good customer service for the price we paid. We stayed at this hotel just a few nights ago, and I experienced claustrophobia for the first time in my life when we got stuck in the elevator. Although we were rescued within 10 minutes, it seemed like the longest 10 minutes of my life. Thankfully the elevator phone worked. After our rescue, we were taken to our room where we were placed over the freeway noise, and the extra bed we requested and paid for ahead was not in our room. We were moved to another room with a bit better location, but still no extra bed. It was finally taken care of, but no offer of any compensation or apology from the staff. Don't take the service elevator either. When we were settled in our room, we took this elevator which took us to a lower floor where we got stuck in the stairwell. All the exit doors were locked. A disappointing ending to an otherwise great vacation.

<Content>Only rate is 5 star I was staying at this place during an international exhibition because all city hotels were fully booked. This hotel rated 5 star provides service of a 3 star establishment at highly exagerated prices. Beside the free shuttle bus to the airport which runs at 20 min intervals there is nothing recommendable at this place. Really disappointing!

<Content>Redneck Alert, Snobs only get service here. Got there, in a rental Mercedes, at 730 pm Friday night, 3-31-06. To fly out to USA, next day. Porter was good with all luggage and walmart bags from EuroDisney. Check-in staff/front desk was quik, and they expected us from Reservation 4 weeks earlier (noted on computer we told them late arrival). Put bags in room and went to park car at Garage less than 1 minute away.($20 euros a night,about $24 US Dollars)....then,,,,we try to get some food....We all come down to 1st floor,(me,ex-wife,18 yr old daughter,15 yr old son,) ask where the restaurant is,,,pointed in the right direction, we go down a hall, 830 pm, road weary, we need food,,,,go into 1st room on left, no receptionist,,,so we sit down. Oops, no go, receptionist shows up and says this room for Lufthansa board meeting people. cool. no problem, she did her job, we left to next restaurant on the left (inside the hotel),,,Receptionist there was quick to note , that her restaurant was for people with suit/tie and dresses for the women....OK, she pointed to the OTHER restaurant,,,down a sidewalk,outside the hotel. Realize,this is not downtown.This WAS the last shot we had to get some food for the night. there are no gas and go's near here....there was a buffet, in the 3rd/outside restaurant(under the cover of the main hotel)...we were quikly seated right beside the kitchen outlet. we did our buffet thing, (all food,even the fish, had a horse radish/rotten mustard taste to it,)the bread was good we all agreed, probably leftovers from the other 2 restaurants,,(notice all 3 restaurants have the same back/common kitchen) the wait staff had no intention of serving us a coke, my daughter graciously shared hers with me, after 3rd asking of waitress to bring me a coke. So disgusted I was with the service, and the seating by the kitchen for mostly american speaking people, I left no tip, which I did hear a hearty laugh from the waitress as I left paying my bill in full. Good Karma of the day came when my ex-wife, seeing my disgust, said, but at the end of the day, she will still be a snotty waitress/hating her job/miserable attitude...that goes for all the waitstaff in restaurants there, at that hotel....Next day, different Porter, helped with luggage back into the trunk of the Mercedes....Different front desk people also, were friendly.

<Content>was allright I usually stay here before flying back to the states on a morning flight. The shuttle bus is very convienient. I avoid parking charges by returning a rental car after I arrive at the hotel, gas station is right down the street between Hotel and airport. Also stock up there with beverages, sandwiches etc.unless you absolutely have to have a restaurant meal. Rooms are ok, soundproof, a/c works (not always the case in europe even in higher rated hotels)

<Content>Don't go if you expect 5 Star service! I have so far only given positive reviews to hotels and this is one of the few hotels where I have to say it does in now way deserve its 5 star rating. I was stuck in the executive tower which feature normal rooms which are allready somewhat worn. While the overall features and amenities certainly seem 5 star the service def. is NOT. My reservation was bungled up, they first refused to cancel a double booking which they did, not me. They don't offer valet and I had to scour the lobby myself for a luggage cart. They don't own their own parking garage and you have to pay in the garage instead of having it added to your bill. On the second night I dropped off the rental car in terminal II and wanted to take a shuttle bus to the hotel. The shuttle broke down at the terminal with hotel guests in it an the hotel was unable to provide alternate transportation. I then had to take the airport shuttle to terminal 1 and take the second hotel shuttle to the hotel. All in all took me longer than an hour to do all this. Good thing I had no luggage or a flight to catch! The hotel insulted me further by offering a drink coupon to console me after I complained about the inept service. Hardly 5 star service or convenience and typical German inflexibility! Stay at the Steigenberger Esprit instead, it has good rooms at much more reasonable rates and at least doesn't pretend to offer great service!
