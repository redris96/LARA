<Content>Simply the best My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Chancellor for 4 nights at the beginning of December and loved it.This is the second time we have stayed here, and after a break of three years we didn't know if it would still be as good, and it was even better!!It is spotlessly clean, had the most comfortable bed out of everywhere we stayed whilst on our six week vacation, is in the best spot right at union square, and has the best and most efficient staff that we encountered.This, I am sure is because of the General Manager Mr Wes Tyler, who we had the pleasure of meeting while we were visiting. He cares about the hotel's reputation and it shows in every aspect of the running of the hotel.Breakfast in Luques restaurant was faultless every morning, and the staff were friendly and very efficient, especially Yesmie ( I hope this is how her name is spelt) she was probably the most efficient wait person I have ever encountered.Susan at the tour desk, who I believe has been there 35 years, knows everything there is to know about SF, so it worth picking her brain for information.All, in all, we had a wonderful time at the Chancellor and plan to go back in about eighteen months.Hotels can make or break your holiday, and this one certainly makes it. As my husband kept saying whilst we were there Why would you stay anywhere elseCongratulations Mr Tyler and staff on a job well done!!

<Content>super little hotel in super spot My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in December before returning to NZ.This hotel was in a fabulous location- right on Union Square and the trams went right past the door!The room was a bit on the small side but it had everything we needed and was clean.The staff on the front desk were very helpful as was the lady who organised our taxi to take us to the airport.We would definitely stay here again. There is a Borders next door and a Walgreens in the same block. The hotel restaurant does a good breakfast.I recommend hiring a bike down at Fisherman's Wharf and cycling over the Golden Gate bridge down to Sausalito- and get the ferry back past Alcatraz!Also a great little bistro we found on the Powell-Hyde tram line called 1550 Hyde in Hyde St. www.1550hyde.com. Delicious food and nice atmosphere.

<Content>Great hotel in the perfect location We stayed three nights at the Chancellor in mid-december, and it was perfect for us. The location is excellent, the hotel staff was extremely helpful and the room as advertised.The room was small by U.S. standards, but larger than many rooms of comparable quality that I have stayed in in Europe. The room was funished nicely and kept clean by the staff. And anyone who reads reviews on this site or the hotel's website should not be surprised by the small size of the room, as they seem to go out of their way to make sure people understand what type of hotel they are.Overall, we found everyone at the Chancellor to be very nice and the hotel to be an excellent value. We will stay here again.

<Content>A Rough Start...but Recovered Everything we could say has been said...This hotel is a good value for the location.The management has taken great pains to make it pleasant in spite of its age.The heating system is poor, uneven and loud. Each room does have its own portable heater to get the temperature up.The manager aggressively addresses problems.

<Content>Nice Hotel Our stay was in september during our honeymoon and San Francisco was our first stop, we were only there for a few days and knew we wanted something central and not nessecarily luxurious and this is what you get. The rooms are pretty small but they are well kept and very clean, the location is right on union square where there is plenty of shops etc but as a tourist you may find yourself spending quite a bit of time around the fisherman wharf area.I was a little annoyed that there was no mention of any congratulations on our honeymoon as it was on our booking especially as other reviewers had mentioned they got champagne etc on a special occaison, anyway this wasn't a big deal but it is the little things that make the difference. Overall if you want a hotel that is central, clean and for a decent price, I don't think you can go wrong with this place.

<Content>Good value at the Chancellor I was in San Francisco for a conference and had a lovely stay at the Chancellor. I am female and was travelling alone but felt perfectly safe in this hotel. The rooms are not plush but are tastefully decorated with proper duvets, TVs, little bowls of sweets etc. The bathrooms are tiny but very nice with good, hot showers. The free tea and coffee - and free wifi in the rooms - are nice touches. The best thing about this hotel is the location - right on Union Square. I didn't eat at the restaurant (it's worth queuing at the famous Dottie's true blue cafe round the corner for brunch!), so can't comment on that.

<Content>Comfy Bed in Cozy Room Great value. While room was small, it was beautifully appointed, had a great, comfy bed and lots of little extras that made our stay really nice. For example, they have pillow options available upon request (satin ones to keep your hair-do nice, down ones, body pillows, knee pillows, etc.) . The bathroom was tiny, but the tub was DEEP, so it would make for a nice bath. Also, this is an old building (thus the small rooms), so the windows open--a great bonus for sleepers who like fresh air. Lastly, the location is so convenient: Union Square is literally right out side the front door; the famous Sears breakfast place is next door (and if that's too crowded, the hotel's restaurant serves a great breakfast); and public transportation, including cable cars are steps away. Would definitely return and recommend it without reservation. Rooms at the back of the hotel were very quiet. Rooms at the front may be noisy, ask at desk.

<Content>Better than expected My family booked our stay at the Chancellor at their 800 number, based on the favorable ratings from Trip Advisor. Helpful young man gave us the same internet rates, locked in the room rate, adjoining rooms, with a queen next to 2 twins on a high floor. We were not disappointed. Can't beat the location, as noted in most other reviewers, as with all historic SF hotels elevators, rooms and bathrooms are cozy. This hotel is spotlessly clean, very well maintained, the recent renovation did wonders. very tastefully done. Nice linens and furnishings. Far better than many other overpriced SF hotels that we have stayed at. We will be back. One of the best deals was the room rate with cost of parking included when requested. Added about $15 to the room rate of one room, it is off site and about a block away but an excellent value with in and out privileges. Sorry you won't find a fancy monogrammed robe in the room, but they do have a portable heater, and an umbrella for your use in the event of a weather change. It is next door to Borders Books, a 24 hour Walgreens for those last minute needs. Did I say this hotel is spotlessly clean and well maintained! Enjoy your stay.

<Content>Overall okay experience with a few minor issues Booked this hotel for three nights via Expedia for under $500 Canadian.Good:- Free wireless Internet- Excellent location - less than a block from Union Square- Comfortable bed and great pillow menu- A rubber ducky in the bathroom - hilarious!- Large walk-in closetBad/Ugly:- Room was quite cold (San Francisco was going through a bit of a cold spell) and the central heating system was not very reliable. Thankfully there was an electric portable oil heater in the room.- No coffee or tea in the room- Bathroom looked very dated and tub was chipped and discolored- Ironing Board cover was extremely discolored - I was afraid of ironing my shirts in case the stains would transfer from the cover to them!

<Content>Perfect place I lived in San Francisco for many years and wanted a well-priced downtown location. I requested and received an upper floor room with a view. A high floor and a view of Union Square. Perfect. The room was small but very clean, had a large closet, desk, sitting area and a regular sized bathroom. The staff was terrific, the location unbeatable and I would definitely stay there on my next visit. I fell asleep and woke up with the wonderful sound of the cable car bells. I was home! I know this city and you cannot beat the price for this location. Highly recommend.

We approached a number of hotels but were not happy until we got to the Chancellor where we were delighted to obtain a room which had everything we needed and the staff were kind and helpful.The central location was great and access to everything was so easy.I will certainly book the Chancellor again when I visit San Francisco to see family.JaniferAustralia

<Content>Great choice My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of a 3 month RTW trip. I had researched extensively on trip advisor and chose this hotel based on the reviews plus the hotel's own website. Our TA booked it for us, at a cheaper rate than we could, so that was a positive to begin with. On our last trip to San Francisco we had stayed at Fisherman's Wharf, but wanted to stay at Union Square this time.We were extremely pleased with everything about The Chancellor. The room size was fine, especially after having spent some time in Europe, where rooms can be very small. The bathroom may have been small, but had the requisite bath (and a nice deep one), shower over it, washbasin, toilet and a shelf for toiletries, so what more do you need? Not to mention the rubber ducky and the toiletries. I enquired whether the ducky was complimentary - not only was it, but I was given another (better) one as well. The body lotion is lovely, and there was also shampoo, bath salts, shower cap, cotton balls and cotton buds. The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were fine. We did not avail ourselves of the pillow menu, but there was enough there for the fussiest of sleepers. While we were there, the TVs were being changed for flatscreens. We had plenty of space in the wardrobe to hang things. We left one suitcase in it on a stand, and had the other one in the room. There was also an in room safe, which we used, an iron and ironing board, which we didn't use and an umbrella which, thankfully, we didn't need.We availed ourselves of the tea and coffee (and the occasional cookie) in the foyer, but do prefer to be able to make our own in the room. However, again it was better than the hotels where we stayed in Europe, none of which had any free tea or coffee, in the room or elsewhere.We ate breakfast in the hotel twice, and found it to be tasty and filling, and cheaper than other places. It was actually the only time on our holiday where breakfast was not provided, so found this additional meal to be an expense we'd rather not have (the Australian dollar had dropped dramatically in value while we were away, so everything became much more expensive than we'd anticipated).Our room was on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel, so was noisy with the windows open. However, when we wanted to sleep, we just closed the windows and used the ceiling fan for cooling. And I did enjoy hearing the city noises, anyway, and at least we had a good view.The staff were always friendly and helpful, although I never did see Wes, the manager. I had enjoyed reading his trip advisor posts, both in the review section and on the San Francisco forum. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel on our departure day, which was helpful, as we had a 10.30 pm flight (all 14 and a half hous of it) home that night. A 12 noon checkout was also good - it gave me time to pack and rearrange our luggage that morning.For the price we paid and for the location I highly recommend this hotel. If we ever make a third visit to San Francisco, we'll definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location, Great place!! We stayed at the Chancellor for 5 nights in early November.My husband and I were traveling with our 23mth old son, although the room was a little squished with a crib in it, it was livable. The rooms were lovely, very nicely decorated and comfortable. The location of the Chancellor was perfect, shopping was close, public transport was a breeze. The staff were friendly and helpful.Really nothing to fault about our stay!Though if you are traveling with a child (who has bottles still) please remember it is an older hotel that has been renovated, so there is no in room fridge or microwave. This can be difficult but we made our way around it!

<Content>Return visit We stayed here in April, and when returning to California decided to spend a couple of nights back here.Again, couldn't fault the hotel in any way. I think what they get so right is that the staff on reception are all so friendly without overdoing it. I enquiried about the make of the body lotion, and on returning to my room discovered five extra bottles of it - nice touch.The rooms are fine and the beds are very comfortable. As always mentioned, the location can't be beaten.After staying here we went to Yosemite, but decided to return to the Chancellor for another night before setting off down the coast - back into the same room (three times in this room - may ask for a different one for a change if we ever go back).It really is a great hotel, but most of all the staff make it what it is. Oh yes, and the cookies are great, especially the cranberry ones!

<Content>Fantastic Honeymoon Location We have just returned from our California driving Honeymoon and the first 4 nights of our trip were spent at the Chancellor. We originally had a different hotel booked for our stay but after reading the reviews on TA we decided to change to the Chancellor and we're so pleased we did. The location was fantastic, there was so much to see within a short distance. The Cable Cars stop right outside the door to take you to the other places that need exploring.Check in was a breeze, we were put in room 1205, so on the 12th floor, with a side room overlooking Union Square and Macy's. The room was fantastic, very clean and tidy and with a nice bottle of Champagne wating for us! I have stayed in many smaller rooms than this with no space to store your luggage so this room was fine for us. The bed was fantastically comfortable. The bathroom was a little small but everything worked fine and it was very clean so it didn't cause any problems. We had food credit that came with our room so we ate breakfast in Luques each day and it was lovely food. The service was great, there was a never ending supply of coffee and the menu was so extensive neither of us had the same thing twice.To be honest I don't have a bad thing to say about the Chancellor. Will I return to San Francisco - yes, will I return to the Chancellor - most definitely. And I would recommend the place to all of my family and friends who may be thinging about visiting.

The position is central for accessing most areas of San Francisco, the room although small, was well eqiped and comfortable, the staff were very helpful, coffee and cookies were always available free of charge in the lobby and there were plenty of local restaurants to choose from. For a city hotel and considering what we paid there was little that we could fault.

<Content>Great Hotel Just returned from our 3 week trip, driving down the West Coast from San Francisco to San Diego (and flying on to Las Vegas) and this was our favourite hotel. We stayed there for 3 nights.The location is great; hop on hop off the cable cars.The bed is probably one of the most comfortable we have ever slept on.The breakfast menu is extensive, the portions huge and tasted great.The coffee and cookies in the lobby is a nice touch (even though I was sent 'downstairs' on a number of occasions to bring a few back to the room).Parking is fine. Although it seems a bit daunting at first driving to a car park in a city that you've just arrived in, it really is easy to find (they provide you with a map) and is 2 minutes walk away. For the money saving and the ease of access, we preferred this over the valet parking option.We would love to return to San Francisco one day and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great City Hotel The Chancellor was a great place to stay in the city. Right in the middle of Union Square we were far enough away from the Wharf and other high tourist areas, but everything was still so close! It was nice because it was relatively quite at night since the stores were all closed. We are from Cleveland so the time change had us up at 6:00. No worries though - one morning we beat the rush of the Sears Fine Foods (right next door to the hotel  definitely worth a stop) for breakfast (one morning there was a pretty long line at about 9am) and then we caught the cable cars with the locals as soon as it started its run - I think around 7ish?? The hotel was a nice stopping ground, but if you are someone who likes to spend time in your room I would be a little cautious - the rooms are pretty small. This was perfect for us and the right price. We would definitely stay at The Chancellor on our next trip to the city.

<Content>Great place to stay at the Union Square We stayed at the Chancellor hotel at the Union Square from 21st to the 29th of Aug, for a conference at the Grand Hyatt and we really enjoyed it.Check in :Easy and a friendly. We had requested a refrigerator in the room (based on one of the TA reviews鈥?it really was very useful)Room:Really comfortable for two people. The walk-in closet really expanded the space so that you could store your suitcases and not bump into anything. We had asked for the topmost floor overlooking the Union square, based on TA reviews and were glad for the choice. We weren't bothered by traffic or noise, and in fact found the music filtering in every evening from the Union square really charming. The sound of the cable cars and fire engines wasn't bad enough to disturb our sleep.Bathroom:Slightly on the smaller size, but big enough when we used it one at a time. Wished we had used the comfortable bath-tub (and the rubber duck).Lobby :The hotel lobby is intimate and cosy enough that you welcome coming back after a cool and tiring day. The freshly baked cookies with different types baked everyday (chocolate chip, raisin etc), coffee and apples were appreciated. Infact after the first day, when we had Starbucks, we didn't really feel the need to have any coffee elsewhere. ( I usually obsess over my coffee, and I really liked it).Location:(I hate saying location, location, location, location) Great. Just right next to Union square, a hop across to cafes, diners, small bistros, delis, a cable car stop right across, and very convenient for our conference also- just a block across.Staff:Rory, Steve, and the other guys at the reception- very helpful. Any question we had, use of the business center to print our boarding cards, picking up a Fedex for us and calling us up when it came- very helpful.LuquesFilling breakfast with cheerful staff (especially Nancy). We had breakfast a day before the conference and it was really good. Bacon usually is too salty to eat, but even an occasional non-vegetarian like me enjoyed it. My wife had the veggie menu and felt her breakfast was ok.Smell:I know somebody had mentioned some smell in the lobby. I didn't really notice any smell except the nice smell of popcorn. There was however some funny smell in the passage outside our room. Just a minor point, and not really a big issue, as the room was comfortable, (non smelly) and the location cant be beaten.Would we come back here- Yes! in a heartbeat.. Just loved San Francisco, and the convenience and homely feel of the Chancellor had a lot to do with it.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Just returned after a 3 night stay at the Chancellor. Loved it!The location is superb; shops, cafes and cable cars on the doorstep and Union Square across the street. Yes, the room and bathroom were small but they were freshly decorated and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfy and had nice, soft pillows. We were able to check-in 3 hours early, which was handy and were given a quiet room on the back of the hotel, which meant we never heard any street noise (just next door's TV!)We caught a cab from the airport and used the hotel-recommended shuttle-bus service, Lorrie's Shuttle, on the way back. We would probably use them both ways next time, as they are cheaper than a cab and you can book them directly from the hotel's web site.The hotel facilities were great - a small bar off the foyer, a pleasant cafe for breakfast (and lunch) and a guest computer  printer for flight check-ins etc. We found all the staff helpful.The one-day MUNI passes are very good value for all public transport and give you the freedom to jump on and off the cable cars. You can buy them from the tour desk for $11 (cash only).Loved San Fran and loved the Chancellor!

<Content>The extra little touches made it memorable We stayed here for four nights, the final leg of a 3.5 week tour and what a way to finish. I'd let the hotel know that we were celebrating our Silver Wedding Anniversary and they left champagne, champagne flutes and a photo frame in our room on the first night. A lovely personal touch from the hotel.The room was extremely comfortable with a great view of Union Square and it is in an excellent location with cable car stops just outside. Free tea and coffee was available in the lobby all day, another bonus. Breakfast in the restaurant was good value and great quality.Considering the central location I felt it was good value for money and I wouldn't stay anywhere else if I'm lucky enough to go back to San Francisco.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel ! We spent 5 nights at the Chancellor Hotel. We had a very enjoyable stay. The rooms are very clean and I loved the walk-in closet! The bed and linens were comfortable.Even though we did not try the pillow menu, it is a great feature. (the pillows we had on the bed were perfect for us). Also, the option to rent (very inexpensive) a foot or bath massager is a good idea. Those hills are killers !We were on the 13th floor (no bad luck here !) and had a nice view toward Union Square. With the window open and the ceiling fan on, our room was ok for temperature ... It was quite warm the week we were there. Remember that Sept  Oct is summer in San Fran. The staff was all friendly and very helpful. From storing our luggage when we arrived early to buying muni passes and answering all our questions on directions etc... Thanks to all for the great service.All the little touches made the Chancellor a perfect choice... the coffee, tea, cookies, apples in the lobby... the candy and rubber ducky in the room ~~ All made us feel welcome !

Only a few blocks from one of the largest shopping areas ive ever seen and the cable car runs on the street right in front of the hotel and takes you directly to fishermans wharf. my girlfriend and i had a few drinks at the lobby bar which was manned by a friendly bartender whose name i wish i could remember. lucky for us the hotel was kind enough to store our bags after checkout so that we could explore the city. we've recommended this hotel to everyone we knew who were heading to the bay.

<Content>Great Location and Terrific Staff! We stayed at the Chancellor on the recommendation of a friend and made the reservations directly through the hotel. The rates were easily comparable to any others available. The hotel is located close to Union Square on the Cable Car line, and it was therefore easy to get around via public transportation.One of the desk clerks went out of her way to be helpful and for that I was quite grateful. We received an unexpected gift just before we left on Saturday evening, and had no way to get it home. Desiree R. took it upon herself to take it to a UPS store on Monday morning and made arrangements to have it shipped to me. I think that was above and beyond the call of a desk clerk's duty, and that kind of service, I hope, is typical of all their employees.We would certainly recommend the Chancellor Hotel to friends traveling to San Francisco.

It's in a great location, they accomodated our early arrival, had a welcoming present for us in our room (they knew it was my husbands birthday), the bed was comfortable, the room was spacious enough (really, who is spending tons of time in their room in SF anyway???) and the staff were friendly. There were definitely sounds of the city to be heard from our open window at night, but again, it's San Francisco! The only bad thing I would comment on was the water pressure - the shower could have been a bit stronger, but I wouldn't let that stop us from booking here again. Had a wonderful time.

<Content>Location, Service, Comfort My husband and I celebrated our honeymoon in San Francisco from October 12-16. We arrived too early to check in but the staff gladly held our baggage until check-in so we could go explore the streets of the city. I had requested we have a room on a high floor as my husband and I prefer height in a hotel room; we were on the 15th floor, the highest floor of the building. Upon checking into our room, we were surprised to find champagne, chocolates, and a gift from the staff in celebration of our marriage. Our view overlooked Union Square. The staff were all friendly and quick to help with any questions or needs. The room had a large walk-in closet -- a rare gem in a dense city like San Francisco -- and was well-appointed. The price simply couldn't be beat as I did some extensive research before we booked this trip. The bed linens were nice and comfortable, the room was extremely clean and the operable window allowed sun and wind in to relax us after walking up all those SF hills! Should we return to San Francisco for another visit (who wouldn't??) we will definitely stay at the Chancellor again. Its location on Union Square lends itself to a variety of dining, shopping and transit options. There is a cable car stop outside the hotel and the Powell Station where you can catch the Muni or BART is only a couple of blocks away. If you are considering the Chancellor, just go ahead and book it!

<Content>Outstanding hotel Stayed here for 3 nights October 4th - 7th. The trip served as a birthday celebration for my wife and being Patriots fans we travelled to see them play the 49ers. I e-mailed Wes ahead of time to let him know the theme for the trip out west and his staff and himself were very welcoming. There was a bottle of wine, a throw blanket(49ers...but it's the thought that counts), and a picture frame present for my wife. This hotel is as advertised and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be centrally located to everything, and to experience customer service at its best. Thank you to Wes and all who made us feel welcome.

<Content>Awesome! Really liked the reviews of this hotel and delighted to see that they actually take the time to respond to some of the comments people make! Shows they take pride in what they do!! So we booked it and very pleased we did.Staff were very friendly and very helpful. Location was fabulous and the hotel amenities were brilliant. Particularly like the on-tap tea and coffee available in the lobby all day - lovely to come back to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon! The bedroom was very clean and tidy. I have to say, I was really worried about the fact I'd neglected to ask for a quiet room and we were then given a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the street. However, I needn't have worried because once the windows were closed, you could hardly hear a thing except for the ding ding of the cable cars - great double glazing!! No problem with there only being a ceiling fan instead of AC either (I find AC units are difficult to regular and just end up making me ill).Overally, great location, great service, great value for money. Definitely would stay here again!!

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Chancellor My husband and I are just back from our first trip to San Francisco. I chose the Chancellor based on reviews on Trip Advisor, and we were not disappointed. I e-mailed the manager, Wes Tyler, several times prior to our trip with questions and he always responded promptly, which was a nice touch. I'm not sure one would get this at a larger hotel. EVERYTHING about our stay at the Chancellor more than met our expectations. We had booked shuttle service from the airport with Lorrie's, which I found on the hotel's website and which I'm sure saved us considerable time as we were unfamiliar with getting around San Francisco. We arrived early in the morning and our room was not yet ready, but we had expected this and left our bags to go on an Alcatraz tour. When we returned, we went to our room which, as requested prior to our arrival, was a corner room with a view of Union Square (room 1203). Surprise! Waiting for us was a bottle of sparkling wine, two Chancellor wine glasses, gift-wrapped photo frame, and nice note from the hotel staff congratulating us on our recent marriage. What a way to welcome your guests! The room was painted in lovely shades of green and taupe, with nice prints on the walls. The bed had a soft white comforter and many pillows. Television, armchairs, dressers, lamps, etc. were more than adequate. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept like babies for the four nights we were there. The bathroom was plenty big for the both of us, and well-appointed with soap, shampoo, lotion, tissues, cotton balls and Q-Tips, hair dryer, and makeup mirror (plus the rubber ducky was a cute touch!). The ceiling fan and open windows provided more than enough ventilation. The large closet was much appreciated, as was the iron, ironing board, and in-room safe. The room was very quiet at all times, and street noise was not bothersome. All of the staff that we encountered were efficient, friendly, and helpful--particularly Steve (helped us with restaurant reservations), Susie (answered transportation questions and arranged shuttle service back to SFO), and Matt (brought our bags to the room). Everyone that we saw truly seemed to enjoy working at the hotel. We visited both the bar and restaurant and had pleasant experiences along with moderately priced, tasty meals/drinks. As many reviewers have previously noted, the location of the Chancellor can't be beat for just about anything a tourist would want to do in San Francisco, particularly shopping and dining. If we ever return to San Francisco (which I sincerely hope to do, because I fell in love with it), there is no way I would stay anywhere other than the Chancellor. THANK YOU!

<Content>Great hotel in great location We stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for 4 night at the start of our California trip. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We had asked for a high floor and got it and we had side views of Union Square. The room was nice but very warm in the evening and would have been better with air conditioning. The bar staff were friendly, drink prices were reasonable.and there was a good atmosphere. Cookies and coffee were available all day. We didn't have a car when we stayed at the Chancellor and we didn't need one. The location was ideal, right at the corner of Union Square and opposite the cable car stop. We managed to get around the city by cable car, walking and the hop on hop off bus. We would definately go back to the Chancellor hotel.

<Content>Ideal LOcation Booked as part of a road trip, we arrived by car and had valet parking, although slightly more than parking ourselves it was well worth the extra to just unload and get our room.Friendly front of house staff informed us about the free cookies, fruit etc in lobby and our cases were taken up to our room. Rooms are clean, and have all the necessities, including free wifi. Some have mentioned size as an issue, but coming from the U.K. we felt it was good for a boutique hotel in a city. Bathrooms are old fashioned (vintage !)but the deep baths are fab to soak in.Dinner at Sears next door recommended. One point to mention was the really informative and helpful female bartender - a font of knowledge about bars and eating in the area. Will visit again.

<Content>Great location! We did alot of research before booking this hotel and we were not disappointed. Before, we left I checked the weather and found they were having a mini heat wave and so I was a bit nervous as I knew there was no AC at the hotel, I needn't have worried the ceilng fan does more than enough to take the heat away so if that is a worry for you, don't, you do not need AC here!!The location is wonderful and the staff are very friendly and helpful and the cookies in the lobby are a really lovely touch.I had read the reviews about small rooms and so was suprised to find that the rooms were of standard european size and not small at all to my standards. There is also plenty of room to store your cases which frees up even more room.We checked in early and were pleased to find our room was already ready for us as well as there being a welcome gift in there for our upcoming wedding. It was a really wonderful touch and made us feel really special.There was only one drawback of this hotel and that is my new husband is now obsessed with collecting rubber ducks!!!We would definately stay here again!

<Content>Well placed hotel We booked this hotel, as a direct result of reading Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed, we asked for a quiet room on a higher floor and that it is precisely what we got. OK, there was no view, but we could here the cable cars (we had our window open), which gave a good ambience. Yes the rooms are small - not unlike many European city hotels - no problem. All staff were pleasant  helpful.For breakfast we went to Lori's dinner on Mason St - but there are numerous other places.

<Content>Still good second time around We stayed for three nights at the Chancellor as a prelude to a long motor tour. We have stayed there before and were so satisfied with the experience that we never really considered going anywhere else. This time was equally as good.We had asked for a quiet room to help us through the first night's jet lag and we were not disappointed. It was on a high floor to avoid the traffic sounds but still had a partial view of Union Square and Powell Street. It was not air conditioned but we have never found this a problem in San Francisco and I think the age of the building must make installation extemely difficult. The room was fairly small by US standards but beautifully decorated and properly serviced. The staff are all cheerfully efficient and the restaurant has a good choice for breakfast (and lunch, if you want to stay indoors. We never have!). The Tour Desk booked us a nice wine tour so that I could drink before starting to self drive.The rest of our time was spent revisiting our favourite locations, travelling by cable car or local bus. The Chancellor's location is ideal for starting such expeditions and, in view of this and its many other charms, it is very reasonably priced.We were not impressed by Sears Restaurant, the nearest to the Chancellor. It may be historic but this does not excuse poor food and indifferent service. However this has no connection with the Chancellor, apart from proximity.

<Content>Good choice for San Francisco Just off Union Square on Powell St, the hotel is right in the centre of the action but seemed quite quiet in terms of streat noise. Our initial room was large with a very comfortable bed, nice bathroom and free wi fi. After some noise problems with an adjoining room, we were upgraded to their best suite and the staff were very apologetic. Neither room had any shower gel, just soap and shampoo/conditioner. Reception had free coffee and cookies in the morning and afternoon which was welcome. Borders book shop next door excellent source of maps. We were trying to keep meal costs down but enjoyed two good quality meals just around the corner on Mason Street at Lori's Diner, a 50's themed diner and at Cafe Mason...the later had an excellent Loin of pork, with vegetables and rice for about eight pounds. Beers seem to be around 2.50 for a bottle, whatever your tipple.If you have the time...get across to Tiburon on the other side of the bay...$18 round trip...it's a peaceful haven with super views back to SF and the ferry goes right past Alcatraz to boot.Final hint - buy the local Muni card...$18 for three days unlimited local transport including the touristy cable cars.

<Content>A pleasure to stay in this hotel We want to add a another positiv review after staying in this hotel for 4 nights in September.We loved this hotel because of the following (in random order):1. the location: spot on Unioin Square - cable cars, shopping, China town are all right outside the door2. the beds: very confortable3. the quiet room (1106, i think it was - corner room on the 11th floor)4. the extra storage room5. Sears: just next door, serve the best breakfast - try the 18 Swedish Pancakes!!!6. transportation: very easy to get other areas of town with the busses that stops near by hotel7. the internett: PC available for free in the lobby and also wireless internet in room8. the cute lady in the kiosk in the lobby9. the cleanliness of the roomWe have no complaints at all! We hope this hotel make it to the top of the hotel ranking ;-)

<Content>Just starting to lose some of its lustre I've stayed at the Chancellor a couple of times, and for the first time I was slightly disappointed. I should point out the positives of the hotel still vastly out-weigh the negatives: the location, the quality of staff, the sweets and cookies etc. are all reasons why I would recommend the Chancellor to someone who wanted to stay in downtown San Francisco. However, I would now have to issue a couple of caveats to that recommendation, and that the hotel is just beginning to look a little bit tired...for example, when we went into our room, the first sight of the bathroom was not pleasant, with a bath-tub that had definitely seen better days to the extent that we decided to have showers during our stay. I know Wes will read this, so I hope he takes this as constructed criticism from someone who genuinely likes this hotel - I would just like to point out to him that with some small investments in certain areas - redecorating the bathrooms, improving the tvs would not go amiss.

<Content>Perfect spot! I wanted a weekend in SF withOUT a car. The Chancellor is the perfect location for that. They even had a link on their website to Lorrie's Airport Shuttle making getting to the Chancellor a breeze and getting back to SFO equally comfortable. The room was comfy and quiet with a ceiling fan that kept the room perfectly fresh and cool. I was thrilled with the huge soaking tub. I asked for a room on a high floor on the quieter side of the building and they met my needs perfectly. The bed was wonderful. The closet was nice to have to hang out my things. The coffee, cookies, and bowl of fruit in the lobby were a nice touch. The breakfast spot NEXT DOOR called Sears is worth the short wait...perfect waffles, Swedish pancakes and international visitors: eat at the bar for conversation. The Cable Cars run right out front of the Chancellor and you can get the tourist transit pass at the activities desk in the Chancellor (3 days of Cable Cars, Buses, Trolleys--so fun. If I have any complaint it was that smoking was allowed in their bar that is out in the lobby making the short wait for the elevator stinky late at night. The Chancellor is so lovely and the staff is AMAZINGLY welcoming, helpful and courteously friendly. Thank you. I will be back!!

<Content>First Class Hotel in San Francisco Just back from a road trip to California, where we started off with four nights in the Chancellor Hotel.We booked this hotel for four nights based on Trip Advisor recommendations, and we weren't disappointed. The hotel is an boutique style establishment, and is steps from Union Square. It has been commented that the rooms are small, we didn't think so, I would say they are of a similar size to European non-chain hotels. Our room was very clean, tidy, and well maintained, the ceiling fan kept the temperature just nice, and with a walk in closet and a very nice bathroom, they are more than adequate.What makes this hotel so good is the staff, they are enthusiastic, polite, and well informed, they make a visitor to the hotel feel so welcome, and nothing seems to much trouble for them. A special mention must go to Yesmie and Mao in Luques restaurant, they are so cheerful in the morning, they along with the excellent breakfast, made for a great start to the day. We will return to San Francisco in the near future, and we will book into the Chancellor again without a shadow of a doubt.Well done to Wes and all his staff.

<Content>Pleased with the Chancellor Hotel I booked the Chancellor after a lot of research, including on TripAdvisor, and I was pleased with my choice. I was travelling alone on business, and had struggled to find something within a fairly tight budget range that was in a safe location.I was allowed to check in early, which was hugely appreciated as I'd arrived from Australia and had already seen 1pm twice that day. My room faced Powell Street, which is, admittedly, noisy, but it didn't stop me sleeping as the bed was so comfy! The cable cars bells and traffic noise are all part of the atmosphere anyway, although the guy at a hotel down the road with a whistle gets pretty annoying!The location, as others have noted, is excellent. I went everywhere (including out to Palo Alto and Mountain View) on the Bay area's excellent (if complicated) public transport system, which is very good value for money. The staff at the hotel are generally friendly and helpful, although I did find the woman at the tour desk rather pushy - if you just stick to the buses around the city and avoid the expensive cable cars, you really don't need a MUNI pass, its cheaper just to buy ordinary transfers.Check out at five in the morning was very efficient too. All in all a good stay.

<Content>Good hotel - excellent location We stayed at the Chancellor for 3 nights whilst sightseeing in San Francisco. The hotel is in an excellent location, just off Union Square. One of the terminus points for the Powell-Hyde cable car line was only about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Riding this cable car is an easy and fun way to get to the Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39 areas. If shopping is your thing, there are many, many shops and department stores within a few blocks of the hotel. Our room was well-presented, clean and of a decent size. The only real problem was the lack of air conditioning in the room; this was no surprise as the hotel's website makes clear that A/C is not available. It was very hot during some of our stay in San Francisco and the room's ceiling fan wasn't really up to keeping the room cool.Tea, coffee and cookies are available free-of-charge in the hotel lobby. Breakfast was not included in the price of our room. There is a restaurant within the hotel. We ate breakfast there one morning, which was ok but a little expensive.

<Content>Great Hotel!!! My boyfriend and I stayed in the Chancellor Hotel from 1st - 7th September inclusive. The hotel is in a fantastic location and has a fantastic service! All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The housekeepers did an excellent job every day!! The week we stayed was absolutely roasting hot weather, but we didn't find having no AC a problem at all. The ceiling fan was more than sufficient. The rooms are a bit small, but thats only a minor complaint, as I had done tonnes of shopping and was running out of space to put it towards the end of my stay!!!! Everything about this hotel was excellent. I would gladly recommend this hotel to any customer, whether young or old!!! Thanks to all the staff, especially the housekeepers, for making our stay at the Chancellor Hotel so memorable.

Our first U.S. hotel was the Chancellor. What a way to start a holiday, a lovely hotel with real nice, pleasant and helpful staff. Enjoyed sitting in Luque's bar talking to Alicia and watching her pour our beers on her recommendation. Cosy hotel with a great location and have vowed to go back there. San Francisco was superb and we still have a lot to see, we were only there 4 days before flying on to Las Vegas and NY to complete our holiday. Once again, Thank you to all at the Chancellor.

<Content>Location Location Location I was originally booked into a different hotel when I first started planning this vacation but after checking with TA, I decided to look for another and came across the reviews for the Chancellor - on the strength of that, I asked for a change to this hotel. I have not been disappointed.The location could not be better if you are without a car - I elected not to pick up the hire car until we were due to leave and am glad I did now, like every big city, cars can be as much a hinderance as a help when you aren't actually in them!We had no trouble getting around on public transport, the hotel is so conveniently located, Macy's can be seen across the square, Bloomingdale's down the street maybe 10 mins walk if that.Any number of restaurants and bars close by to eat, including the hotel's own restaurant.Some reviewers have mentioned street noise at night - well there is some, our room overlooked Powell St. But it didn't bother us at all, certainly no worse than should be expected for somewhere in a central location.The rooms are clean and tidy, ours was small with single beds but more than adequate, Hotel staff friendly and helpful.Overall, this hotel was just right for our needs and I have no hesitation recommending it - would definitely stay here again.

<Content>OK, but spoilt by officious service in restaurant and rude concierge We booked two nights in the Chancellor on the strength of trip adviser reviews. The check-in desk people and bell help were both great, and it was good to have tea and coffee. The room was smaller than the Hilton, but comfortable.However, the waitress in the restaurant for breakfast was extremely officious and and the concierge was no help at all - she seemed to just want us to go away. this we did and went back to use the wonderful concierge service in the Hilton from which we had just moved.Overall, we preferred the Hilton.

The hotel had loads of character and we had a great time staying there. The rooms look like they had been recently renovated, and were clean and spacious. We loved the free lollies in the room, which were re-filled everyday! We saw the popcorn and coffee in the lobby, but didn't realise they were free til now!! Probably a good thing, because we ate far to much - the food is fantasic in San Francisco. The staff were like the hotel, full of character and some quite quirky, but all very willing to help. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Loved the Chancellor Ioved the pleasant soothing decor of the room, overlooking Union Square. It had a ceiling fan, was cool and you could open the window. There was lots of room and the bathroom though small was very cleverly arranged. The only negative for me was the smell in the lobby as another reviewer mentioned. I have a nose like a sniffer dog (my husband says) and I tracked it down to the popcorn dispenser. I happen to hate the smell of popcorn, so maybe it was OK for those raised on that smell. I would suggest relocating the dispenser, to remove the smell which is a bit of a surprise to us foreigers, in particular. The staff were delightful and always pleasant and helpful.

<Content>Outstanding hotel We stayed at the Chancellor for six nights during the San Francisco leg of our honeymoon trip. I chose it after seeing the great reviews it had on Trip Advisor, and can only say that it is thoroughly deserving of the praise it has received on here.We stayed in room 1205, up on the twelfth floor, and had lovely views of Union Square and Macy's. Although I had told them in advance we would be arriving in the evening, about 9pm, I was still a little worried that they might have forgotten and given our room away; this ended up being totally unfounded, as the reservations and front desk staff were very efficient and had everything noted down perfectly. They had even noted it was our honeymoon, and congratulated us when we checked in, and we had a lovely little gift waiting for us in our room from them, which was wonderful. The hotel is very swish, with a pleasant lobby and bar area with marble floors. Our room was great, spotlessly clean, with a lovely comfortable bed. The cleaning staff were great, as we'd sometimes only go out for a couple of hours late morning, and by the time we came back the room had always been made up. The staff on the front desk were really helpful, warm and knowledgeable about the local area. The hotel's location is also really good, as you are very close to all the shops of Union Square, and you can easily get to buses and the metro for travel around the city. Union Square is very touristy, so we were pleased to get away to some of the other parts when we weren't shopping.There was no air conditioning in the room, but with the ceiling fan we had no problems with temperature at all - although it was quite foggy while we were there, so was never that hot outside. We also had no problems with noise in the room; you were too high to be disturbed by any street noise, and you could only hear people outside your room as much as you would in any hotel.I really liked my stay here, and was very very pleased that I chose the Chancellor. I wasn't sure if you were meant to take the cute rubber ducky home with you from the bathroom, but I did, and he is now a nice reminder of our lovely stay there in my bathroom at home.I would definitely recommend this hotel, and it would be my first choice for any future trip to San Francisco. It is well deserving of its rank on here, and is also a lot cheaper than many of the hotels with similar ratings.Thank you Chancellor Hotel!

<Content>Just a 5point rating again... :) One of my favorite things about Chancellor is that Mr Wes Tyler, General Manager keeps responding the reviews. Please do not laugh, but it was a major point I choose this hotel for the first days of our 2 weeks journey in Bay Area. And it was a really good choice. The hotel is located right in the heart of the city, a great starting point for your walking tours on the streets of San Francisco.The people at the front desk are very helpful and friendly. We asked for a room at the highest floor available at arriving. We had a backyard view we were not interested in as we used the room only for sleeping. The room was very clean and tasteful equipped; we just loved the calming green and beige/brown colors. And the pillows smelled great!The 鈥渧ery-best鈥?was the breakfast at the Chancellor, especially our waiter. It is a shame but I don鈥檛 remember his name. He was always smiling and friendly talking to us even if he had to run. He knew from the second day on how my boyfriend likes his coffee and took care the pancakes have just the right temperature when arriving at our table. Thank you!We would definitely stay at Chancellor next time.

<Content>Understated Elegance We travel to San Francisco many times a year and occasionally stay at the Chancellor Hotel...it is our only choice on our infrequent wish to stay in Union Square. The Chancellor is fine old world elegance and sophistication. Staff at The Chancellor are consistently professional and expertly courteous. Though the rooms are small to tiny with small bathrooms, all our needs are met quite efficiently with attention to the smallest detail. Beautiful linens, comfortable beds. Old World is the description that comes to mind. Warm and secure. Very fair price for Union Square, plus parking of course...still one of the best rates in Union Square.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Great Service Booked this hotel on the advice of the reviewers. It was definitely everything that I expected and more. The rooms, although a touch small were clean, pleasant, and having a window that actually opened was a great plus. We were used to small hotel rooms travelling Europe so it didn't bother us at all. We were hardly ever in the room, as SF has so much to offer. The lobby was spacious and comfortable, and there was always fresh fruit, coffee and cookies. This was such a wecome sight when coming in from a long walk up and down the hills of SF! The bar in the lobby was wecolming as well, with 2 flat screen TVs that usually had a ball game or some other sporting event on. The people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. There was a menu in the room offering many different types of pillows, should you require something softer, more supportive, or hypoallergenic. There was also a list of spa equipment to add to the bath tub should you feel like a foot or bubble massage after a long day of walking. The tub was very deep and long, and a bath after a long day in SF was just what the doctor ordered! The location is great, as everyone else mentioned, right outside is a cable car stop (good to ride on at least once for the novelty) and shopping in the area is abundant, with Macys, Saks, Neimans, all across the street. Dotties True Blue Cafe, a wonderful breakfast spot was about a 3 block walk, ( and you need that walk, especially after you eat dotties fabulous breakfasts). A wonderful Mexican restaurant, Colibri, was also a couple of blocks away. If you get a chance eat at the Slanted Door at the Ferry Building for lunch or dinner. Food is fabulous. The Chancellor was just the perfect home base for all our SF explorations.

<Content>Very comfortable, great location The Chancellor hotel is a wonderful old hotel that we thouroughly enjoyed staying at for 6 nights. It is in a great location in Union Square on Powell Street, there is a cable car stop just outside the door, MUNI is only a quick couple blocks away. And if you like to shop, all the big, fashionable stores are at Union Square! The rooms aren't large, but they were certainly big enough for two of us and our luggage (we stayed in two different rooms). The second room we had was on the 4th floor overlooking busy Powell street but the hotel had a white noise machine we could use. They have free cookies, popcorn, and fruit in the lobby and a computer we could use. If you like a hotel bar, they have one but it isn't very large. Overall, an excellent stay and excellent service helping us with arranging tours and transportation. They also have a pillow menu where you can select up to two different types of pillows to try :)

<Content>It's old, small and historic, just as advertised I knew this was an old historic hotel with small rooms, no air conditioning, and small bathrooms when I booked it. Even so, after having stayed there, I just don't think it's a property which deserves an above average or excellent rating. In my opinion, it's just average and after all, what's wrong with an average rating for an average hotel?

<Content>Reviews are right on for this one We stayed at the Cancellor Hotel in July during part of our honeymoon. The reviews on this website are right on spot regarding the hotel. The hotel is older and the rooms are smaller but very clean and the staff is very helpful. They made our honeymoon special with champagne and a gift in our room at check in. On a side note, we loved the restaurant next door for breakfast called Sears.

<Content>Awesome location, great price This hotel is smack dab in Union Square, which is a perfect location for a tourist to San Fran. Although the room is very small, it is cozy and well decorated in soothing greens and browns. The room overall is very functional, with a very large closet so your bags don't overwhelm the room. The bathroom is also tiny, but well decorated in small tiles and a deep soaking tub. The place overall was extremely clean, and so relaxing and charming (it is a very old/historic hotel). It was so fun to roll out of bed and be in the middle of it all, and the staff was accomodating and very friendly. The cleaning crew cleaned in the afternoon unless you put a sign up requesting early cleaning, which was very nice.Although the place was wonderful overall, it was slightly noisy since you are right in Union Square, and during our stay there was some construction right across the street. We were never bothered by the noise, though, unless the windows were open. The walls are slightly thin, and although not generally a problem because it attracts a pretty quiet clientele, we did have to ask the person on his cell phone next to us to keep it down at 4 a.m. The bathroom is not well-ventilated, so they ask that you keep the window open while you shower, which is slightly awkward to get to and has no curtain. The window is small, however, and tucked back over the toilet. There is also no heat in the hotel, so you must use a stand alone radiator, which works okay, but not great. This was only a problem a couple nights since we had unusually cold weather. The lobby also smells slightly moldy, which several people noted during our stay. These were the only cons about the place and were honestly very minor in comparison to how great the place was.For the price, this place was fantastic and I would recommend it again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Outstanding hotel, outstanding staff. Like in many big cities, finding a comfortable and decently pricedhotel in the downtown of San Francisco can bea unsurmountable challenge. After reading all the good reviews on Tripadvisor we decided to try the Chancellor and we now have found our home away from home in SF.My wife and I booked a 4 night stay from the hotel website. They had a special for stays of 3 nights or more which made it a real bargain.We flew into SFO and took a cab to the hotel. As soon as our cab pulled up in front of the hotel we were greeted warmly by Martin, the hotel bellman, who took care of our bags. We got to the hotel before check-in time and were prepared tohave to wait, however, the room was ready and check-in wasa breeze. When we made the reservation we had requested aquiet, mid floor, room and that's what we got. We went up to the room on the 7th floor and a couple of minutes later Martin showed up at our door with our luggage. Martin notonly brought our suitcase into the room but he set them up onthe luggage stands and showed us where everything was.Martin was so genuinely warm and welcoming that we knew we had made the right choice by staying at the chancellor.The room was wonderful, with a queen bed, two armchairs and a coffee table. It had a large walking closet so overall I would notdescribe it as small. The room was tastefully decorated and very comfortable. Once thing that impressed me was that although the hotel is right on Powell Street, one of the majorarteries of downtown SF, and a stone's throw away from busy Union Square, our room was indeed quiet and we slept like babiesat night, despite leaving the window open.The room had wireless internet which worked flawlesslyand we even had a pillow menu which allows you to ordervarious types of pillows. The bathroom was very nice with one annoying little thing.The toilet is smaller than usual. What's odd is thatthere is actually plenty of room for a bigger one. Since the rooms have recently been renovated I was wondering if the toiletis a remnant of an old bathroom layout where the door clearancerequired such a small design. It would be nice if the toilets werereplaced. This being said, it's manageable even for a 6'5 blokelike me.There's a restaurant (Luques) on the ground floor of the hotel.We had breakfast there one morning and the food was verygood. Very conveniently, the hotel lobby has a booth were you can get information on tours, book tickets for various attractions, buy stamps, etc... We bought our Muni passes there. The passesallow you to use the buses, metro and the famous Cable Carsfor 3 or 7 days. Note that there is a Cable car stop right in frontof the hotel. In fact, if you do not mind standing up in the Cable car you are probably better off catching a ride in front of the hotelrather than queuing for ages at the bottom of Powell street.This is actually a general tip. Cable cars are never filled up to their max capacity at the first stop of the lines. I guess that'sto allow other people to hop in along the way. Therefore, if you are traveling from Powell St or Fisherman'sWharf which seem to always be crowded, just walk to the nextCable car stop and you should be able to hop in on the nextcar.Both metro and Bart are a short walk away from the hotel. On ourlast day we rented a car and that evening we decided to use thevalet parking service. We parked the car in front of the hotel (thereisn't much room to park on Powell St so if you can't find a spotjust drive around the block until there's an opening), left the keyswith reception and they took care of everything. We paid around30 dollars which compared to what some of the other hotels around charge for parking is a rather good price. There is alsothe option of parking the car yourself for a smaller cost.We checked out the next morning. We had arranged with the front desk to have our car delivered at the time of our check-out.The valet brought the car over but there were not free spots on Powell (you cannot double park because of the Cable cars) so he had to circle the block a couple of times. A couple of hotel staffeven went out on the street and started regulating the traffic infront of the hotel so that our car could be parked.This is an ideal hotel for a romantic getaway or a businesstrip to SF. If you are traveling with small children, however,you might want to look for another location because, as thehotel website states, it is not recommended to have morethan 2 people per room. Incidentally, the hotel website isvery well designed and you can download a very complete list of room features and hotel amenities that should help you indeciding if this hotel is for you. Also, don't forget to check outthe specials on the website for some very good deals.We really had a fabulous stay at the Chancellor. While we were there my wife and I really felt at home and not in somehotel room. In an age where customer service is often littleless than a afterthought, the Chancellor shines by the genuinewarmth and professionalism of its staff. From the bellman and the front desk, to the chambermaid and the maintenance people,everyone we met at the hotel was great.This is probably the real secret to the Chancellor, its people.You really get a sense of a team working together to pleasethe guests. We love SF but we loved it even more with the Chancellor.There's only one problem with this hotel. You will be sad to leave it.

<Content>A charming place to stay The Chancellor exudes charm and character. The staff are exceptional and the location is as good as it gets - one min walk from Union Square. We stayed at The Orchard Hotel when we first arrived, it was twice the price and is further away from Union Square. Our room was compact but exceptionally clean and comfortable. This hotel reminds me of an old New York hotel. After three weeks travelling in CA and staying in all types of accommodation (5 star, BB's etc) The Chancellor is one of the nicest places we have stayed.PS. the breakfast is good!

You are right on Union Square and are close to all public transportation options.The onsite restaurant was a good option for breakfast and we found it better than a few of the breakfast spots within a few blocks of the hotel (Sears, Lori's Diner).The room was clean and a good size for two people. Our room was on the front of the hotel and there was a bit of noise from Powell Street but the hotel was nice enough to provide a white noise machine. This made sleeping very easy.I'd stay here again in a heartbeat - excellent location, great value and great staff.

<Content>Great Hotel in Heart of Union Square This is a great hotel right in the middle of San Francisco. The staff is very helpful. The rooms are clean and well furnished. Besides our bed at home the bed at the Chancellor is one of the most comfortable that I've ever slept on. My only complaint is that the walls seem a little thin. We could hear the people next door watching TV. The Powell Cable car is right in front of the hotel. Shopping and restaurants are a stone throw away. The restaurant in the hotel is great for breakfast. The staff there are extremely helpful. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.

The room had modern decor, the bed was really comfy and it even had a jar of sweets in the room- nice touch! Another great touch was the coffee/tea/cookies/apples available in the lobby. The staff were very friendly and helpful and overall this hotel was great value for money. We would definitely recommend it and hope to stay there again ourselves.

<Content>Very pleasant stay at the chancellor As far as central locations in San Francisco go, you can't get it much better. As we had a room pretty high up on the backside of the hotel we were able to sleep with the windows open, without any noise penetrating from the streets below. The room had a walkin closet, with ample space for all the luggage we were carrying with us, and the bathroom was a decent size as well.The staff downstairs were very helpful, the lady in the concession stand in the lobby helped us with our tourarrangements and some of the other questions. It is located extremely central, so it is very easy from there to start your trips, whether it is shopping (50 yards to union square) or the cable carts (passing by the hotel) that tickles your fancy.When staying in San Francisco this is as far as I am concerned a very good choice. For the price it can not be beat.

<Content>Location! Well, SF is pricey. However, I believe the Chancellor is a decent option within the under $200 range. Yes, the rooms are rather small, and the decor not as fresh as one would like. but it clean, and the location is probably one of the best in the Union Square area. So, the Chancellor is a very decently priced option in the Union Square area, if you don't plan on spending too much time in the (smallish) room with the cable cars ringing outside.

I adored the painted green wall  the green chairs. it added some life to the room  made it feel very cozy. it was a very chilly SF summer during my stay  the heat could have been better in the room. luckily there was a portable heater in the closet. Friendly staff, comfy room, clean and a great view. btw, if you're not used to city noise, ask for a room in the back. i got trolley noise which was fine by me but i'm sure others wouldn't be happy.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in Union Square This was a great hotel. I traveled with my mother for a week long workshop in the area and just needed a decent place to stay for a decent price (hard to find in San Francisco). This place was much better than decent! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, the food in the restaurant (we only ate breakfast there) was delicious, and the rooms were very tidy, tastfully decorated, and had everything we needed - and even brought us a mini fridge upon request. The rooms were a quite a bit smaller than others I stayed in but it did not bother us one bit. I would highly recommend this hotel also for location! You are right in Union Square which has plenty of shops and restaurants as well as cable car rides and museums. Great hotel!

<Content>Great Experience I stayed at the Chancellor last year over Labor Day. First off the Location is perfect for doing all the things one would want to do in San Fran. The best part is the the Rail is right by the hotel so if your like me and dont like to spend money on cabs it's perfect.The saff was great, and helped out with booking a car for a day, and always made sure the room was clean. The staff also booked my activities as well.The room was clean and if I didnt know any better I would think this hotel would charge alot more than they do. Price was great compared to others in the same area that arent as nice.I am going back this Labor Day was well!!Overall this Hotel is a perfect fit for anyone wanting all the above!Great experience!!

<Content>Excellent City Base for San Francisco What a great hotel! Before we travelled I e-mailed the manager (Wes Tyler) with a request and also mentioned that we were there for a special occasion. He organised my request and also arranged a surprise gift for us! Where else would you get service like that?From the time we arrived we felt welcome and the staff were very professional and friendly. I don't remember their names to mention but I do remember Rory on reception because he is from Ireland.One of the best things about this hotel is the coffee, tea and cookies in the lobby which are available all day. This makes a big difference if you just want a quick refreshing cup of coffee at any stage during the day. There are also apples in the lobby but make sure you finish eating them before stepping on the cable car as you are not allowed eat on them.The location of the hotel is first class as it is at Union Square and the cable car stops right outside. You can walk to all the shops, visit the visitors information centre on the square where you can buy a three day travel pass for $18 and the train station is just down the road.Our bedroom was great and the ceiling fan was efficient at keeping the room cool. It was not as big as the rooms you would get out of town but it is certainly a good size for a city centre hotel.Wes, if you read this review you will realise that we appreciate all the hard work you and all your well trained staff do to keep their guests happy.

<Content>Location, location, location The location directly on the Powell cable car line is very convenient to many attractions. And it is just uphill from and beyond the noisy crowds of Market Street. The rooms were very clean, nicely appointed, and rather small. Complimentary coffee, cookies and newspapers in the lobby were appreciated. Staff were polite, professional and helpful. It would be nice to have a view - but hotels offering that tend to charge twice the price. Besides, there is plently to view outside: San Franscisco is not the place to hole up in a hotel room all day!

<Content>Loved this hotel This hotel was perfect for us. We stayed 4 nights with our two teenagers on 15th floor. The location, the service, the value and the atmosphere were just perfect. We didn't need air con and loved hearing the city wake up and go to sleep. Even though you are right next to Union Square we did not find it noisy.The trams stop outside the hotel (but are very busy going North during mornings and South during evenings), a Muni card is worth getting as the trams are $5 per ride and SF has great public transport system

<Content>We enjoyed our stay at the Chancellor In early June of this year my wife and I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel, Union Square, San Fran. Our stay was quite comfortable notwithstanding that the room was a little tight compared with other hotels that we had been staying at during our holidays in Canada and the USA. This minor issue was more than compensated for by the location, price and friendliness of the staff. We had breakfast at the hotel dining room each day and found it to be excellent. The Eggs Creole - Benedict were particularly great and I must E-Mail the hotel to see if I can get the recipe. The young man who was holding down the Tour Shop for his mother in the Hotel Foyer was very helpful and the young lady who served behind the bar was also very pleasant. Whilst we were in San Fran I took the opportunity to visit the Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill and was pleasantly surprised to note that the Chancellor had sponsored one of the brick steps leading up to the tower, something the reception staff at the Hotel was unaware of. All in all we would stay at the Chancellor again when in San Fran and recommend it to other travellers who are looking for reasonable digs without having to go over the top with costs. Incidently, we chose the Chancellor after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic hotel! The Chancellor Hotel is the best in San Francisco! I stayed there for 3 days at the end of June, and absolutely loved it! The location is perfect, right on Union Square with great transport links to everywhere else in the city. We had the corner room on the 13th floor, so I am not sure if it was a bit larger than usual but it was a great size. The bed is one of the most comfortable beds I have found in a hotel with duvets instead of the usual blanket. We also got a good recommendation from the front desk for a Pizza place two blocks north of the hotel called Uncle Vito's. Not much to look at from the outside, but great pizza!I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, it feels stylish and boutiquey whilst being in the centre of the city and best of all at a good price! What more could one ask for?

<Content>Great hotel This hotel is just excellent!! Location is perfect, the rooms were nice and clean. And the hotel staff is so friendly and helpful. I was really impressed about how service minded they were! My friends and I stayed for 4 nights and had nothing to complain about. I will definately book Chancellor for my next stay in SF!:)

<Content>ChancellorJun08 A pretty good location but hotel is quite small - a narrow yet tall building with no real view except from a corner of Union Sq. The room was quite small but it was a nice, bright  clean. The breakfast was quite good. Often the problem in SF hotels is the parking and we had to not only unload the car ourselves but park it in a nearby garage and of course there's a charge. I would have thought the hotel could at least arrange to valet park cars if you paid for that. SF in June was hot  sunny one moment, cold grey  cloudy the next! The Gay Pride Parade was fab - lots of colour and sound and outrageousness - GREAT!! [Next year try and get ALL the floats to have music playing as it is SO much better that way (and with smaller gaps between the different groups).] If you have never been to one you MUST eat at a Cheesecake Factory as they are simply superb!!

<Content>"When you find a GOOD thing.......stick to it..........!" Returned to the Chancellor, bringing friends this time, so 'repeat business' says it all really.Delighted with the tasteful refurbishments since our first visit.Same with the friendly service by ALL staff at the hotel.The location ensures you are a tourist 'in the thick of it' but the management style makes sure you are treated as a valued guest.We find no reason to consider changing our San Fran. accommodation. See you again next time!

<Content>Great Location We had a great 3 days at this hotel at the start of our holiday. When we checked in (very efficient) we were told we had the best room - we did!! Top floor with a view of Union Square. The room was excellent, the staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was any trouble. Coffee and cookies on tap all day. SFO was having a heatwave at the time but we did not find this to be a problem at all - a fan was available if we wanted it. Housekeeping was always good. The hotel could not be faulted and we would stay here again without a doubt. A great hotel in a great city.

<Content>The only place to stay in SF - an absolute gem! Last time I went to SF in 2006, I narrowed my hotel choices down to 2: the Monaco and the Chancellor. I ended up choosing the Monaco, which I subsequently regretted. Last week, I was finally able to correct my mistake and enjoyed the most wonderful stay at the Chancellor. I cannot fault this hotel - everything from start to finish was perfection. All the hotel employees were courteous and efficient; the food at the hotel restaurant, Luques, was delicious (open for breakfast. lunch and dinner - we just had the breakfast), and the service prompt and friendly; the room was spacious and beautifully appointed; the hotel had wonderful maps and anything else you needed for your stay in SF. Full disclosure: Like the previous reviewer, I was also upgraded to the top floor, which I'm sure had larger rooms. This hotel has everything - even the option to borrow a noise machine if you need one (I never travel without mine, and did use it in SF, as I am a light sleeper). The bed was amazingly comfortable - and you can request different pillows if you wish (we did not need to do this, though - ours were perfect!). The bath products were wonderful and smelled great and the linens were unbelievably soft.The location is unbeatable - you are steps from the cable cars and the Market Street lines, which can take you right to Fisherman's Wharf or the Ferry Building, respectively, and other places as well. Not to mention there is a world of amazing shopping at your feet when you step out the door! Any questions we had were answered courteously and promptly, and the valet process was great. If you have any questions at all, do not hesitate to ask any of the staff - I was in a state of disbelief with regard to how consistently friendly, cheerful, and helpful every single member of the staff was. That alone makes this hotel a standout, but it is an exceptional hotel for so many other reasons as well! If you have forgotten anything or need anything, there is a Walgreens nearby. I went into the Borders next door to the hotel to pick up a local magazine. Cabs were plentiful and easily found just outside the hotel at any time of day or night. The Chancellor is officially the only place I will stay in SF, and I will recommend the hotel to anyone and everyone without hesitation. It is truly a gem of a hotel in the heart of SF. Thank you, Chancellor and Wes, for a unbelievably wonderful and pleasant stay. I cannot wait to return!

<Content>A Gem My two children and I stayed at the Chancellor for four nights this month during a two week road trip from South Carolina to San Francisco. I had read the reviews and chose the Chancellor because of location primarily. We were checking in after three nights in the Bellagio in Las Vegas so I wasn't sure about how the kids would react after all of the flash and grandiosity of the previous hotel but they loved the Chancellor as did I for several reasons. First, of course location, location, location. So close to great eats (Sears was awesome for dinner and breakfast), great shopping, parking (reasonable), drug stores, transportation whether you want a quick ride to the Wharf on the F line or a thrilling ride on the cable car. It was warm in SF when we were there but we opened the windows and everything was fine with very little noise. Because the hotel is small and we saw the same employees (who would quickly recognize us) over and over again, the children were able to be a little more autonomous than usual so they were allowed to go downstairs alone to get the complimentary popcorn, apples, and cookies. My son used the ethernet connections in the lounge with me in the evenings and everyone was so friendly to him. My debit card was lost at one point and I called the front desk to ask about the location of a Wachovia bank in SF. They called around and found one that was open that day, a Saturday, called the bank to confirm the hours, mapquested the directions, highlighted the route and sent me on my happy way. I think that the age and size of the hotel give it a unique and friendly feeling that really makes you feel a part of SF. My 10 year old daughter took the yellow duck she was given at the Chancellor into every hotel pool we visited on our way home. I watched as it floated around as she was playing and on several occasions adults picked it up and read the inscription on it and asked my daughter about it and that began a lengthy and colorful conversation about her awesome trip to SF and her stay at the Chancellor. Thanks Wes.

<Content>Favourite hotel in SF My wife and I spent 9 nights at the Chancellor Hotel, which has become my favourite hotel in SF (third time there) due to the central location, good service and traveller friendly prices.We were quite hot a couple of days due to having a room out to the street and the sun. But we shoulnd't complain that the weather was generous to us during our stay.

<Content>Loved this old hotel that has some smart touches and tries extra hard! We recently had a 4-night stay at the Chancellor and it was one of our best hotel stays ever! First, as a family of four, we knew we are not the ideal customer for the Chancellor, which only has small queen or twin/twin combination rooms. But the location, service, parking option, and price were right so we went for it. The central location just off Union Square and on the cable car line is perfect.Our visit didn't get off on the great start because a really expensive two-bottle pack of wine (from our Sonoma Valley winery visit) was inadvertently left on the sidewalk outside. Matt apparently got everything except for the wine and we didn't notice until we were in the room. It was just as much our fault for not making sure we had everything before we headed up. Well, by the time we realized the wine was missing, somebody was probably already enjoying some great wine!With all that said, Matt was friendly, helpful and informative (and later apologetic about the wine). Check-in was very smooth. The hotel uses a parking garage a block over and, with the in-out privileges, it was very convenient whenever we needed to drive somewhere. Another nice thing is that the Chancellor lets you leave your car in front of the hotel while you check-in and get your stuff upstairs.As other reviewers have already pointed out (and we well knew), the rooms are on the small side and don't have AC. However, the high ceilings make the room feel bigger and the ceiling fan helps cool the room even though we were in SF during an unusually warm week. Despite the tight space, we packed our family of four in and still managed just fine. One unique thing about the Chancellor's rooms are that they each have a small walk-in closet. My 7 year old son liked sleeping on the closet floor so we all had enough room to sleep and get around! The beds were comfortable and we all slept well. The room had nice little touches like free candies, wi-fi access and an in-room safe. And unlike the vast majority of hotels who can't be bothered with it, they recycle! Also, we liked the fact that they only launder and replace towels that you place on the floor, and not all towels each day. On the downside, there was a step up into the bathroom that could pose a tripping hazard, the toilets are very loud (loud enough to be heard in adjacent rooms at night) and there was no refrigerator. Also, our third-floor room only had a view of the back of an adjacent building 10 feet away. We forgot to ask for a view. Oh well....What separates this hotel from the average is the exceptional staff and thoughtful touches around the hotel. Everyone we encountered was very helpful and friendly. Cookies, fresh fruit, coffee, iced tea and ice water were plentiful in the lobby/bar area.We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Luques, several mornings, and we enjoyed the pancakes, waffles and french toast!Overall, it was a great stay!

<Content>Excellent Customer Service! We stayed at the Chancellor from Jun14-17 and absolutely loved it. The location was great, right beside Union square and near all the shops. Ton's of restaurants in the area within walking distance, sushi, pizza, chinese, all american, whatever you are in the mood for. It was easy to get to, we took the BART from the airport, took about 25minutes to get to our stop, just followed the directions, cost was $5.35each one way, walk to the hotel from the BART stop was slightly up hill along Powell, Cable car line, approx 4 blocks or so, took us maybe 10mins. Lovely reception area, check-in could not have been quicker, staff at front desk were very friendly and welcoming. They gave us a package at check-in giving us a discount for the dining area as well as 2 for 1 drinks at the hotel bar. We also received a coupon for the 11% discount at Macy's given to foreign passport holders. Now to the room. I had done my homework and was expecting a smaller size room based on everything I'd read and yes the room is smaller than some, however it is not the smallest room I've ever stayed in and I have travelled a LOT. The room was efficiently layed out, with nothing in the way of the other and SPOTLESSLY clean. I loved the rubber duck in the bathroom and the bath salts that soothed my aching blistered feet. There was more than enough room for two girls who planned on shopping and bringing takeout back to the room. The closet was huge, walkin with a safe in the back, iron, ironing board and an umbrella, just in case, I love it! There was a jar of candy on one of the tables, mint, butterscotch, cinnamon, Jolly rancher, nice touch, we had several. Room service was available, not particularily expensive, however we did not order anything becase coffee was always available and freshly baked cookies as well as apples. We would grab a coffee and cookie in the morning as well as a complimentary newspaper . As mentioned in previous reviews, there is no air conditioning, but the windows in the bathroom and the room open, allowing for air to circulate and there is a fan overhead if you need it, but I don't think you will, average temp during summer is in the mid 70's and it cools down at night. We did not use the fan. We had two single beds and covering up with the lightweight duvet was more than enough to keep us warm or cool at the same time. The bed was extremly comfortable. There is a tour desk in the lobby. They will make arrangements for any tour you like, pick up from the front lobby. We took a day tour of the city, highly recommend it, it took us to all the spots you must see, first time in SFO. If you don't want to book a tour, from this location you are within blocks of China town, taking you maybe 10-15mins to get there. We walked from the Wharf back to the hotel, took us 45 minutes, most of it uphill. No problem. Now to the part that made the biggest impression on us, the hotel staff. It wasn't just the staff at the front desk that were friendly but everyone that worked there said hello to us and smiled. Once we were getting into an elevator and the bellman who was already in the elevator got out to allow us to use the elevator first. He insisted, even though we told him we'd wait. The employee's all seemed happy to be there and ready to work, no private converstaions going on that you fear interrupting or conversations that continue while you wait for someone to notice you are waiting to ask a question and that means a lot to me. I hate feeling like someone is doing me a favour by answering a question. We loved this hotel and stay here again in a minute.

<Content>Clean and Perfect Stayed here on June 13,14 2008. It was very quaint and clean. I took the recommendations of folks on TA and am very pleased I did. First, it was clean. 2nd, the staff was very helpful with advice from restaurants to bars to mass transit. The little bar in the lobby was cool. As well as the free coffee and cookies. My gf and I had a queen bed on the 6th floor. It was quiet as our room faced the roof. So no view, but I did'nt care. The room was small, but it is a neat little hotel in Union Sq in the middle of SF, so what did I expect. It met my expectiations and even exceeded them in some areas. It's not the Ritz, they don't claim to be and the price is not the Ritz. The location is perfect in Union Sq. Keep checking their prices as they might drop them for any given weekend if they have not filled up.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel! We were a group of five women who had a top-notch experience at the Chancellor from start to finish. Our rooms were cozy, charming, spotless and, per our requests, close to each other. We loved the cafe downstairs for breakfast (yes, it really is the best Eggs Benedict in San Francisco!) and the lobby bar was delightful. The hotel felt like the perfect hybrid of New York chic and West Coast cool!The location is fantastic, the cost reasonable and most of all the service is excellent. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and provided top service for our entire stay.Definitely contact the Chancellor if you are staying in SF. I loved everything about it!

Staff great from check in to check out and were a mine of information. Room service was very good and the free bottle of wine on arrival as it was my wifes birthday was very nice.One note of caution the hotel does not have Air con which was fine for us but may be of concern to some.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Chancellor for the first 2 nights of our honeymoon and found it to be excellent. The location is fantastic and the room was charming. We don't understand why some people complain about the size of the rooms. There was lots of hanging space in a walk in closet for clothes and also drawers, how much more room do you need for a holiday?! All the staff we met were really helpful and friendly, even when we popped in during our 8 hour stopover on the way home when we were no longer guests.I would definitely recommend this hotel and already have!

<Content>Great Stay with the personal touch This being part two of our holiday,the first being the Signature in Las Vegas,the rooms were a little smaller.However the hotel is perfectly situated on Union Square is clean and well run and its staff a great team.To mention a few,Alisha behind the bar Matt the bell boy and the Oriental gentleman ( sorry didn't know his name) running the breakfast room all added the personal touch by chatting about anything you wished to ramble on about.Yes,you can always gripe about minor issues like the well worn air conditioning comments but this is San Fransisco not the warmest city in the land. We got exactly what we booked , a quiet room and mid height all as requested.The little extras like cookies and coffee in the lounge and the candy in the room all added to the hotel going that little bit further than many of the other impersonal hotels in the area.If I had one request (not complaint) it would be that the bar could stay open a little later mid week.To summarise ,great location, very comfortable and clean rooms,good breakfast menu and caring and friendly staff.What more do you need.Thanks for helping to make ours a great vacationJohn and Rhona

<Content>Fun little hotel I stayed at the Chancellor with my grown daughter because we had just 2 days and wanted to shop and sightsee. I picked it because the reviews were so great, and I really loved it. You can't beat the location, and the parking set-up worked well for us, since we had a car with us. We left it in the garage most of the time and used the cable car in front of the hotel. Mostly we walked.The room was very small, as was the bathroom, but it was so clean, cute, and neat that we were fine with it. We had been warned through Tripadvisor reviews that the rooms were small. Best of all was the service! Everyone was just real friendly and very helpful. We had a blast!Highly recommend Beach Blanket Babylon if you can get tickets.

<Content>Perfect! What a pleasant place to stay! Immaculately clean room with an extremely comfortable bed. And how refreshing (literally!) to stay in a hotel with windows that open letting in fresh air. I've paid far more to stay in SF at places that weren't half as nice. Nice and quiet too - never heard any noise from within and the bells clanging below as the cable cars rumbled by were very soothing.The Chancellor also holds my personal record for the quickest check- in. Straight up the desk and checked in the most polite fashion in no more than two minutes.Very convenient location too - Union Square is just across the street, the cable cars stop right outside and it's just a few minutes stroll to the stores of Downtown.

The battender in the evening was terrific and was very personable.

And on checkout we were not asked how our stay was..If we had been I would have mentioned it.

<Content>Charming and Convenient We enjoyed our 3 day stay at the Chancellor, a Saturday through Tuesday stay. This was our second visit but they had redecorated since the previous time. We chose it for its convenience and reasonable prices. We liked being in Union Square and close to everything. Although our room faced Powell Street and the Trolley, the window was pretty effective in shutting out the noise. The hotel room was very nice with pretty decor, attractive bed linens, and comfortable pillows. I thought it was charming that warm cookies were at the hotel desk when we checked in at 4:00 and a little later fresh popcorm was available near the bar. The discount coupons for the bar and the restaurant were a nice touch. The desk staff and the bellmen were delightful and efficient. One of our breakfasts was at Sears next door, which is known for its small size pancakes. We would definitely return to the Chancellor.

<Content>Excellent stay - a rare find in the heart of SF. What a wonderful hotel! Great location, best price, excellent value. The standard rooms are very clean and well appointed, and the beds are VERY comfortable - best sleep I've gotten at a hotel in years! Additionally, the staff is amazingly helpful and courteous. Parking is a problem, as it always is in downtown SF, and the parking structure for the hotel is a block away. However, the hotel staff made the whole experience much easier with helpful directions and allowed my car to remain parked in front of the hotel until after the bellman brought all luggage up to my room and I got settled. Additionally, the hotel staff gave me directions everywhere I wanted to go, hailed cabs for me, and allowed me to use their computer and printer at no additional cost. Also, because they do not serve dinner in the restaurant Sunday through Tuesday, they suggested I get take out from next door at Sears, printed out an online menu for me to order from, and suggested I eat in their bar, where I would be most comfortable and could use my laptop. Oh by the way, the hotel offers FREE WiFi access to all guests, in rooms, lobby and bar of the hotel. What a great experience! I would definately stay here again!

<Content>Great Hotel Having read many excellent reviews on Trip Adviser before booking, we decided on the Chancellor - we liked that it was an older and smaller hotel than some . We also liked the evident interest the manager takes in the reviews written on the hotel - we can only assume he acts on anything which is pointed out if at all possible.After a long journey from Ireland, we were greeted by a friendly Irish manager at reception and efficiently checked in. The bellman, Matthew I think, was lovely and clearly loved to work there -always a good sign. He talked well about other staff and management and how long some had been with the hotel. He gave us helpful information on the area. We had a wonderful breakfast one morning- beautifully presented, and served by two lovely Asian staff. The room was cozy and spotless. We had asked for a room high up and quiet and our request was honoured. We thought the complimentary coffee in the lobby was a lovely touch.The location couldnt have been better - we were able to either take buses, trolley or walk to Fishermans Wharf.We thought the value was excellent for a stay in a major city in a downtown hotel.We had been in SF before but would definitely stay in the Chancellor every time from now on. It was homey in a way which you'd expect from a family run B  B in Ireland! Great to find it in a hotel too. Thanks Chancellor.

<Content>good old fashioned service fourth time in san francisco, first time in the chancellor.we usually stay at the much more expensive hilton around the corner. in the future we will stay again at the chancellor.stayed twice on this trip once at the start and once at the end of april. the location is spot on, right on the powell street cable car line on union square which is a great area to stay.the public areas are very nice with comfy sofas in reception and gorgeous fresh cookies, free aswell!the rooms are small by american standards but what they lack in size they make up for in quality. the rooms are very nicely decorated with a nice comfy bed too. the staff were fantastic. i wish i could remember all of their names to thank them in this review. the young male desk clerk and young doorman spent ages making sure my vista computer would pick up the internet in the hotel. the breakfast was very nice and as a guest we got a 10% discount voucher too.overall the hotel provides very good quality rooms and good old fashioned service. didn't get to meet the manager whose comments on here played a big part in choosing the hotel as you can tell from what he says, how much he cares about the guests and that has obviously been passed down to the rest of the staff too.

<Content>A Gem! I am so happy I consulted Trip Advisor before I booked this hotel last minute. It is in such a great location in Union Square, right next door to Sears -- a wondeful breakfast spot; rooms remind me of an old NYC apartment. So nice and tastefully done. Modernized for today's comfort but not modern. The old touches are still preserved. I can't say enough good things. Staff was very helpful. Would definitely recommend and stay again on our next visit to San Francisco.

There are so many options for public transportation within steps of the hotel. On our last day in town, it was raining and the complimentary umbrella came in handy. Of course, the rubber ducky was a cute touch to the room decor! I would stay at the Chancellor again, hands down!

<Content>Unbeatable Location and Service We had a lovely 9 night stay at the Chancellor in May, thanks to Tripadvisor's accurate guest reviews. Thank you Chancellor staff, you're the best! Everything we were looking for in a smaller intimate hotel, about 100 years old: location, location, location, fine service, a charming place for an anniversary trip. We were also in SF for a family wedding at the ritzy St Francis across the street. After studying the different Union Square hotels, we emailed the most promising, requesting a special extended stay quote, and then wrote the Chancellor, asking could they improve on the best offer received, which they did. We were able to stay for 9 nights for less than $1,500. They even had a card  anniversary gift for us. My son and daughter in law also reserved for a shorter stay. They were also delighted  kept saying what a charming hotel (how did you ever find such a gem?). All in all, it was better than we had anticipated. Kudos to the fine staff, who responded promptly  courteously, even providing a small fridge on request. Susan, who effortlessly handles gift shop and concierge duties, arranged for terrific sightseeing trips: wine country, the redwood forest, Monterey and Carmel, Yosemite Natl Park, city sightseeing. We saved so much money on accomodations, we were able to do it all. Airport shuttle is just $14. (Don't forget SF can be chilly  windy even in August. Dress in layers, and Enjoy.)

<Content>Recommended (This was a father/son get-away, booked by mom, reviewed by son, and entered by mom!) I found this hotel through T/A and choose it based on reviews. The first morning they were there, I received praise from both saying much they liked it, and that I had made a great choice. Whew! These guys were so impressed with the architecture, the rooms and the staff. Comments on the beds were positive - soft and nicely appointed. Views from the 13th floor were great. They were never hot. The days were pleasant; nights cool. They slept with the window open, with no noise from outside. The bathroom was not roomy, but served the purpose. (This room sounds much like a very special hotel we stayed in on a trip to Edinburgh, Scotland; small but tasteful.) We are so spoiled in this country by mega-motels, and they are nice for certain purposes, but when you want a comfy bed in a stylish environment, at a reasonable price, in a great city, the Chancellor fits the bill.The location was perfect - much better than the tourist trap of the Wharf. The staff was so helpful and friendly. They didn't eat in the hotel, so can't comment on dining. (A great coffee bar around the corner was Cafe La Taza, and for fine ($$$$) dining they went to Farallon, and had a spectacular meal.) The guys thank ya'll for a great weekend, Wes and staff!

<Content>Perfect for us Never having been to San Francisco, we relied heavily on such reviews as this for guidance. We were very pleased with our choice of the Chancellor. When booking, I inquired about any special rates they were offering, and they generously extended a special winter rate, even though it was due to expire before our arrival. The rooms were very clean and the beds extremely comfortable. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant was exquisite! The location was perfect for getting around easily, and the bell hops were extremely helpful and also very pleasant to talk to and get advice. Our local newspaper had recently listed the Chancellor as a best kept secret in SF and they were right! Even though we were in the front, there was little or no street noise. We checked out on May 13, apparently before the heat wave, so I can't comment on the lack of AC, however, our windows did open a crack, if necessary. The TV was average, no big screen, however, we came here to site see, not watch TV!! I would highly recommend this hotel as extremely comfortable, very clean, chic decor, excellent service, great food, good location. The bar was not large, however, in the evening we always found other travelers from around the globe to visit and share stories with.The little restaurant nextdoor was also excellent, Sears. Right across the street is the Drake, where we walked over and had a drink in the Starlight room overlooking the city and had dinner at the great Italian restaurant in the lobby of the Drake. All in all, a very comfortable and chic boutique hotel.Joe and LisaBirmingham, Michigan

<Content>Great Place - what a value! We picked all of our hotels based on TripAdvisor reviews and this one was the best! The Chancellor is in a perfect location (unless you want to avoid shopping which is plentiful here) for all San Fran travel. Tons of food nearby, starbucks across the street if that's your thing. The staff were great - saved us a place to unload, gave great directions to avoid horrible uphill climbs and were generally really pleasant. The cookies, always available tea/coffee and candy were a nice bonus. The rooms are smaller than some - but we don't spend much time in a room when we travel. The beds are super comfy and the room is well decorated. Water pressure and temp were good - often hit or miss in larger hotels. So glad we stayed here and will definately return.

<Content>Great Value We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our cruise to Panama Canal and S. America. We arrived from our ship before normal check-in time but the girl on the desk was very accomodating and asked us to hold on for a few minutes and she would sort our room out. Within 5-10mns we had checked in to our room!Yes it was rather small but that was no problem to us, we were used to inside cabins on the ship! It was very clean and comfortable looking. The only problem was it was rather warm in the room, just for reference we were NOT there in the 'heatwave', the outside temp was VERY cool for that time of year. We could not understand where the heat was coming from as there was no heat coming out of the radiators? The roof fan did help to cool it slightly as it was too noisy outside to leave the window open. The view of Union Sq was good from our room. The complimentary wine and jar of sweets in the room was a nice touch as was free coffee, cookies etc in the lobby. It was handy having a tour desk in the hotel, we booked a City Tour. The staff were all very helpful regarding tips for eating out etc. The position of the hotel was very handy to the shopping and eating out etc but we were very disconcerted with the vagrants that hung around the hotel and Union Square at night begging etc. I reckon San Fran needs some zero tolerance like NY did a few years back. We saw a tourist practically knocked over by one man who got so close to him rather robustly begging. All in all I would recommend this hotel for it's good value for money, staff attention and location.

<Content>For the birds We knew what we were getting into by selecting a hotel with no AC- but after looking at the average temperatures for SF- we thought we would be ok. So selecting the Chancellor was our choice and this review is not really about the heat. We were in SF during the recent heat wave- it was very hot and miserable to sleep at the Chancellor as we had a front room, the window had no screens (there were crows on the balcony- not exactly something you want to wake up to) so our room had no air flow. It was so helpful (not) that they offered us electric fans as we checked out- in that heat situation- those should have been offered to all guests. The room was a good 20 degrees warmer than the outside temperature. SO- if you happen to go during extreme heat- ask for a room in the back and the extra fan.As for the room, it was very small and while updated in its decor- it was old. The bathroom was also very small (the door barely clears the toilet) with no frills. I would have no problem with this- but it also wasn't very clean. It needed a good scrub and some major cauking.On the positive side, they had a nice lobby restaurant and the location was great.So between the balcony crows and the dirty, small bath. We won't be returning to the Chancellor- but SF was fun.

<Content>Chancellor is a great find - but not for everyone Just returned from three nights at the Chancellor and have mostly very positive things to say about the Chancellor - we would definitely stay there again when returning to San Francisco (which is a wondeful city - everyone should visit). The location is perfect - a few of blocks from the cable-car turnaround, across the street from Union Square, within walking distance of excellent restaurants and bars... I could go on, but suffice it to say that for travellers and tourists, I strongly recommend it. (A quick hint: if you're looking for great breakfasts, go a few blocks south to Cafe Bellini, pick up a sandwich or danish, and enjoy some outdoor dining on the steps in Union Square.)Although our interaction with hotel staff was relatively limited, I must give special mentiont to Rory, who greeted us on arrival late Friday night: in the midst of a very trying set of circumstances (he was alone at the front desk, confronting an ever-increasing line of people waiting to be checked in, a pair of guests whose door-keys refused to work, and someone who kept calling on the phone to ask for driving directions), he maintained his composure and was polite and helpful throughout.As many good things as I have to say about the hotel, it isn't for everyone. I greatly enjoyed the jar of complimentary candy in our room and the free popcorn in the lobby, but some people might see these as gilding the lily. Although I've seen the term boutique applied to the Chancellor, I don't think that's entirely accurate - to me, the term implies a hotel which has been recently renovated to offer the latest in design elements and luxury amenities. That's not the Chancellor. You won't be finding a sleek bar in the lobby, or flat-screen TVs in your room - what you're getting is an older building that could use some renovating, but which with apparent attention and effort has been well-maintained and is certainly punching above its weight. As an example, the beds are very comfortable, but the lobby is dated (if still quite nice). It's an excellent value, it's a great location, I would strongly recommend it - but if you're looking for a cookie-cutter chain environment, or more emphasis on fancy bottles of shampoo and pricey designer bottled water, this isn't for you. The Chancellor offers accommodations with some quirks (both good and bad) and a bit of personality - precisely what some are looking for in a lodging experience, but not exactly what caters to everyone.

<Content>small but comfortable we were there the hottest weekend ever!!!! going there, we knew the hotel would be a small boutique hotel and would be w/o air conditioning. we didn't know how hot it would be tho. having said that, we were still comfortable enough when going to sleep. luckily, we had the quieter rooms in the back and were able to sleep with the windows open for fresh, cooler air. little city noise but didn't we mind that. we are after all in the heart of the city. our room didn't have a view but we were out all day so that didn't bother us at all. i love the fact that we were able to walk everywhere cuz trying to hail down a cab was not an easy task. bell guy, MATT, was able to hail a cab for us in front of the hotel, but to hail down a cab in the city was near to impossible. but with the central location of the hotel walking in any direction was safe and easy. the staff, from the front desk associates, to the bar tenders, to bell men, and to the nice lady at the tour desk, couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.

<Content>Second Time Around - Even Better! This was the second time we have stayed at The Chancellor, the first being in 2006. The rooms have been refurbished since our last stay which is lovely but we were more than pleased to find the service and staff had not changed...they were as attentive, professional and as helpfull as ever. The Chancellor truly is the place to stay in SF. Best location, best price, best staff and best cookies! ....we will be back again!!

<Content>Great Hotel in a great city! After much deliberation and going through the reviews on TA we decided upon the Chancellor and glad to say we weren鈥檛 disappointed. We decided that the Union square area was more suited to us as there was only myself and girlfriend travelling. The Chancellor exceeded our expectations within 10 seconds of check in as we were upgraded for free to a suite, which had two full separate bathrooms, separate living room, fridge, and the all important tea and coffee making facilities. We had requested a room on a high floor with a nice view if possible our suite didn鈥檛 have a view so perhaps they we unable to give us a normal room with a view so they bumped us up to the suite? This was just my thinking anyhow and I鈥檇 have taken the suite over a view anyhow!! We have very little interaction with hotel staff in general unless we have a problem-we had no problems in the Chancellor so our interactions were limited although all the staff were warm and friendly from the cleaners to the front desk staff. We booked our wine country tour via the tour desk in the lobby and our return transport to the airport she was very helpful. With our upgrade I can鈥檛 offer insight into the normal rooms but the suite was probably decorated as the un-refurbished rooms from the website my girlfriend preferred the look of the older rooms anyhow. There isn鈥檛 really allot I can add from previous reviews-the location is excellent with plenty of dinning options and everything you鈥檇 need in and about Union Square. To me the only problems people seem to have with the Chancellor are caused by them not doing their research! The Chancellor is a charming well presented Boutique hotel with great service, it doesn鈥檛 pretend to be luxurious or fancy and their rates reflect this! It鈥檚 a shame that the Chancellor and San Francisco are on the other side of the world from us otherwise we鈥檇 return sooner rather than later! Great hotel that I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate recommending to anyone.

<Content>Great City to visit First stop on our whistle stop tour of the USA.We arrived at the hotel late and not in the best of moods after a long flight from the UK and with all our luggage missing. The reception staff were very helpful and offered to look after our luggage during the night, should it arrive, and it did.We had a room at the front of the Hotel and if offered great views of the street and cable cars, but the downside was the back ground noise for most of the night. it was not a difficult discussion to request a room change, because we had not unpacked. The room transfer was carried out while we were enjoying the sights of San Francisco.The Hotel is in great location for exploring the city, on the main cable car line for different points on the water front, not to mention the underground, and bus service, and of course the shops.Like all hotels in the USA you have no drink making facilities in the room, but next to the bar they seam to have coffee and tea on tap all day, not to mention the cookies in the morning, and fresh pop corn most evenings.In the reception they have information desk so can book all your trips, not to mention the Lorries shuttle for the return trip to the airport.We found the hotel very clean and comfortable and would recommend it to everybody.San Francisco is great city to visit, it felt very clean and most of all very safe.

<Content>Perfect Chancellor Booked the Chancellor after reading all the good reviews on Trip Advisor and they were spot on. This was the first of seven hotels we stayed at on our California trip. Arrived, with my husband and thirteen year old daughter after a long flight and were checked in quickly and efficiently. As requested we had inter-connecting rooms numbers 1302 and 1303. We were very happy with the space we had and slept well on particularly comfortable beds. We had a view of Union Square and Maceys, the latter being of particular importance to my daughter! As was the free supply of popcorn available in the lobby! Great breakfast choice and smiling helpful staff. For dinner ,Scala's Bistro is directly opposite, where the steak is superb. The location of the hotel is excellent.The cable cars run directly outside the hotel and you can get an open top tour bus from outside Maceys. We had a fantastic time in San Francisco and if we were lucky enough to return would definitely stay at The Chancellor.

<Content>Pretty good BUT.... I booked based on reviews on this site. There are HUNDREDS of hotels in SF, and I thought: #5 on the list means it's a good hotel! In all, pretty good! HOWEVER... this is definitely a 3*** hotel, so be aware of that. It's like a nice-ified Day's Inn. Totally do-able, but it definitely is not in the same category as the Marriott or even many of the boutique hotels nearby. I felt like this hotel was 'charming' in the European type of way. If I were in France, I'd love this hotel. But, being from LA, and having tried many many hotels in SF, this one is just above average, not really deserving (IMHO) of being #5 of the TripAdvisor list.That said, it IS a good hotel. I have been to SF numerous times, and always like to try new hotels since there are so many. Chancellor IS indeed in a great location - 1/2 a block from Union Square, and right on the Powell Cable Car line. For vacationers, the location really can't be beat. Service was great - very friendly and courteous. Room was clean and I liked the bright green decor and the pillows. For the price (I booked a king for $160), I would prefer something like Hotel Diva around the corner.

<Content>Excellent Boutique Hotel! Having previously read the reviews on TripAdvisor, I felt quite confident on booking this hotel, and I was not disappointed. We arrived following a long flight, and a sharp introduction to driving in San Francisco (don't!) - we had a simple and very friendly check-in and were straight up to our rooms (which as we had requested were close together).The location is fantastic.. a short walk to the main shopping area, and easy (right outside the hotel) cable car connections towards Fishermans Wharf.The rooms were recently refurbished, and nicely decorated. Excellent walk-in closet, the bathroom was a little small - but thats hardly a problem! I thought it was great that you could plug your MP3 player into the radio, so that you could listen to your own music. And the nice touch of a pot of sweets was lovely!Coffee/Tea were provided in the hotel lobby free-of-charge so you could just help yourself whenever you fancied one - again a nice touch.Off-site parking is available on Sutter Street (quicker to walk to than drive to!) but none-the-less ideally placed. They also do valet parking there if thats your preference.The only downside really was that there was no AC, and the rooms can get a little warm. Yes, you can open the window, but it does get quite noisy with the cable cars... however after the first night I found I could get used the cable car bells, however the emergency services are not quite so quiet!!!Loved the little bar in the hotel.. only thing it closed at 9.30pm every night we were there... thats pretty early. I believe Friday  Saturday nights it is open later. Drink selection is pretty good.Overall, we had a great stay, and we would certainly return to the Chancellor if we find ourselves back in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Location This hotel is a great find. Right in the centre of San Francisco in Union Square, close to all the shops and attractions, with the cable car stop outside the door, and not that expensive. Our room was very nice, a bit small, but who cares, we didn't spend much time there and it had everything we needed. Nice en suite bathroom, wardrobe, iron, ironing board (so useful) TV, hairdryer and all the usual stuff. The bed was very comfortable, slept so well. Note that this hotel is not air conditioned. We were there in April so this was not a problem. Reception were super efficient. Ordered a taxi for us and as we walked into reception were told you're all checked out, no problem, and your taxi is outside - seamless! We did not sample the breakfast in the restaurant so can't speak for that, it was not included in the price, and we found a great place round the corner. There is also a great place next door but we couldn't get in - long queues. Overall, this is a great hotel for tourists on a budget who want somewhere decent and central to stay. Definitely recommended.

<Content>Very nice stay... We very much enjoyed staying at the Chancellor Hotel. the room was very clean and modern. it wasn't luxurious, but for the price it was great. the staff were very helpful and friendly, as were the housekeeping staff. we had a room that faced powell street, and it was crazy noisy, so if you are a light sleeper, i'd not recommend getting a room facing that direction. we didn't mind the noise ourselves, and were not really in the room all that much to worry about it considering how awesome the location is, there is tons to do until all hours of the night. TIP: ask for the memory foam pillows instead of the ones on the bed, we slept like logs on them. (they actually offer a 'pillow menu', so take advantage and sleep on what you like!!!) Make sure to bring your own toiletries, they don't provide spa ones like alot of hotels. (shampoo and bar soap, thats it.)

<Content>loved the Chancellor Have just returned from 2 short stays (2 and 3 days) pre and post cruise at the Chancellor. We booked this hotel based on the good reviews. I would not normally risk a 3 star hotel but the Chancellor was fabulous. The room was big enough for us, very clean and comfortable. The service was excellent, the restaurant for breakfast and lunch was very good. The extras were great cookies and coffee available all day, popcorn in the evening, vouchers for discounted drinks and restaurant, pillow menu and a welcoming gift as we were celebrating an anniversary.The location could not be bettered as it is so convenient for transport and shopping, bars, restaurants etc. This hotel is a credit to the manager as it really cannot be faulted. Excellent value for money. We loved San Francisco and should we ever visit in future, we will not bother looking at other hotels = the Chancellor is the one for us.

<Content>Love the Chancellor We have stayed at many hotels in Union Square and prefer boutique style properties for the character, charm , history and more personalized service they can offer.The Chancellor has all of that and much, much more.The Management and Staff here are not only efficient in their job but give that little bit extra and always with a relaxed and friendly smile . Nothing was too much trouble with any of the staff we encountered. I cannot remember everyones name but Steve and Rory on the front desk, Susan at the Tour Desk, Yuko and Mao all were great.Apart from all the above the hotel is in an absolutely perfect location on Union Square and all the rooms have been recently refurbished. The amenities in each room are all you need and although the rooms are on the smaller side being an historic hotel I really do not think they are all that bad. I have encountered rooms in Europe and Asia a lot smaller .I would urge anyone staying at the Chancellor in future to use the restaurant.Breakfasts here are the equal (my wife says better) than other well promoted places nearby and I know you will not get the excellent service with a smile we got from Mao each time. That's an added extra at no cost.What else can I say.This is a great little hotel in a great city.Do yourself a favour and give it a try and I guarantee you will be back.I know we will.

<Content>Chancellor Hotel, San Francisco--Excellent! I stayed at the Chancellor for two nights, and I was very impressed. The location is perfect, the rates are highly competitive, the rooms are nicely decorated and spotless, and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.I loved the extra touches, like the candy dish in the room and the rubber ducky for the bath. When I got to the airport after checking out, I realized that I had left my jacket in my room. I called the hotel, and they FedExed it to me with no problem.I can say with confidence that whenever I come back to SF, I will stay at the Chancellor, and I'm recommending it to friends and colleagues.

<Content>Great hotel, great locations We stayed here recently. While the room was slightly small, it was spotlessly clean and given a thorough service every day, which is very important to us. The pillowmenu is a nice novelty touch, if not adding uch overall to the stay.The location simply couldn't be better with all of the shops of the union square area within spitting (or walking distance). I would recommend this without hesitation for anyone looking for a very reasonable priced hotel in SF.

<Content>Great Hotel I am writing this review late but I wanted to put my positive review up here so this lovely hotel gets the credit it deserves. We also booked our stay at the chancellor based on the reviews in trip advisor and I must say it lived up to all expectations. I contacted Wes Tyler via e-mail during the holiday weeks to make a reservation. He was very helpful and made the process quite easy. In addition, he was kind enough to extend a special the hotel was running for an additional day, making this stay a tremendous value. In terms of the hotel itself, our room was beautifully decorated and quite comfortable. I do not look for large hotel rooms when I travel because I am not traveling to San Francisco to stay in a hotel room the entire time; I am there to see the city. That being said the rooms are clean and the hotel is well maintained. In addition, the location of this hotel is perfect. It is easily accessible to public transportation leading all over the city and to the airport. The hotel staff is very nice and there are some very nice touches that they include. The hotel provides an umbrella for your use, it was in our closet. Since it rained almost every day we were in the city this was greatly appreciated. They have fresh coffee and cookies (really good cookies!) all day and offered apples and muffins in the morning. They have two computers in the lobby that guest can utilize. My husband inquired about a firm pillow and was given a list of several different types of pillows that he could choose from. When we returned from our outing his pillows were in the room. Finally, the rubber ducky in the bathroom is a cute touch.We enjoyed our stay and we were impressed by all this hotel had to offer for such a great rate. We would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Beleive the Hype The Chancellor Hotel comes highly recommended. The staff were friendly and approachable. The location can't be beaten- close to train, tram, bus and of course the cable car.The room was very similar to that on their website. It was clean, comfortable and quiet considering the location.It made an excellent base for exploring SF. Would definitely use again if lucky enough to return to SF.

<Content>Great Location We stayed here as part of a 50th birthday celebration for my husband. The hotel is in a great location for San Francisco sight seeing and right by the shops! The rooms are small by American standards but very comfortable.The service is great and Wes the manager even arranged a bottle of fizz and a gift for my husband-San Francisco is of course a lovely city to stay in and the hotel made it even better!

<Content>It grew on me When I first got to the property I was a little shocked at how old everything looked. It looked like some run down motel. We had come in at 2 in the morning, had just mistakenly driven thorugh the tenderloin and it was Friday night. The area was hopping with clubs and drunken teenagers. Needless to say we were a bit put off thinking it was gonna be like a seedy place.But then we realized...during the day totally different experience. Service was great, the hotel is a historic building and really refined. the place next door has the best breakfasts, its in the middle of all the shops, parking was cheap compared to the rest of the city. the room was clean, the tub was nice and big for a bath, the bed and sheets were comfy. There are some great bars on Sutter just 2 blocks away. And the value! I would definitely stay there again. Only thing is there is no AC. San Francisco is never really hot but when we went it got up to 85 degrees. It was ok though the room stayed relatively cool, plus not having an AC is soooo sustainable like everything in SF.Stay at Chancellor. Best bang for your buck.

<Content>Great Hotel We have just returned from a lovely stay at the Chancellor. We had let them know that we were coming from our wedding in Las Vegas and there was a bottle of sparkling wine and a photo frame, nicely wrapped in our room. The hotel staff were efficient and friendly, especially the restaurant staff and the the little lady in the gift shop. This is obviously a hotel that is run by an observant and hands-on manager, his details are readily available and special touches like the cookies in reception (only quibble-they ran out by the time we came back from our days out!) and pillow menu show that they are actively trying to maintain their standards by providing thoughtful service rather than gaudy chandeliers and exorbitant prices.

<Content>As good as everyone says This hotel is definately as good as everyone says. We were not disappointed at all. The location is absolutely fantastic being right on Union Square with all the shopping you could possibly want and a cable car stop right out the front (which takes you down to Fisherman's Wharf). Chinatown is a short 5-10 minute walk away with Japantown being a bit further away and easy to get to on the bus (great for Japanese food!)The rooms are very nice. They might not be huge by American standards, but by European standards they are a good size. Everything was spotless and very nicely furnished. We asked for a high floor room and got the 11th floor which looked down towards Union Square. It was very quiet, even with the window open.We booked a package deal which came with parking which was located around the corner (a minutes walk away), as well as a voucher for food/drinks. This paid for our breakfast which was delivered to our room and was massive! A great way to start the day! The price was fantastic at about $150 per night for the parking and $25 voucher.The staff were very friendly at all times and very helpful. I would definately stay here again next time in SF.

<Content>What a find! After extensive(!!) research on Trip adviser we chose the Chancellor based on the rating and reviews- and it was defintely the right choice- Location is fantastic, the cable car passes the door, Bart and Muni a few blocks walk and a muni pass is such good value that its a necessity! Right from check in the staff were helpful and friendly, and I really felt it was genuine! Our room was on the 4th floor, not huge but had everything we needed, bed was amazingly comfortable. I'm a very light sleeper and I didnt have any problems with street noise, even tho we faced the street, in fact once we'd moved on to the next leg of our trip I missed the background noise of the cable cars passing! The hotel is not a modern, anonymous chain - it is a great example of a traditional San Francisco hotel which has history and charm, unique touches like the rubber duck and cookies and popcorn in the lobby set it apart, and after visiting both the Mark Hopkins and the Fairmont we saw that they were both in a similar 'classic' style to the Chancellor, but the Chancellor is half the price!There is so much to see and do in San Francisco, one day we viewed cityscapes from the top of the Coit tower in the morning and in the afternoon dipped our toes in the pacific ocean at the beach! its also nice to get out of the city - we did a wine trip to the Napa Valley which was a fab experience! Easily found and booked online before we went - the company was called Wine country shuttles. Also, for a romantic evening watch the sunset over the city from the Top of the Mark, with a glass of locally produced Domaine Chandon!We'd highly reccomend the Chancellor, and look forward to visiting it, and San Francisco again!

<Content>Great location in San Francisco We stayed at the Chancellor for 3 nights in Marchl. It was everything that previous guests have stated. Great location - very central for shopping, eating and getting around. Front desk staff were helpful when asking for directions/bus or tram stops. There is a great diner next door where we had breakfast during our stay - sorry, we didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment. The rooms are small, but look exactly as the photo's posted on this site and are clean and comfortable. Bathroom is small, but clean. If you come to SF there is so much to do and see, you are not going to be in your room that much. It's a perfect place to crash, drop off your shopping, have a rest and then back out there! No, it's not a luxury hotel, but you are not paying luxury prices - go to the Four Seasons if that's what you want. I would highly recommend the Chancellor. I think it's great that the Manager takes such an active interest in the reviews.

<Content>Affordable,Comfortable,Great Hotel! My top ten reasons I liked the Chancellor Hotel (in no particular order)...1. The staff was extremely friendly 2. The beds were really comfortable3. The huge walk in closet and the comfortably sized bathroom made up for the small room4. The room and bathroom were clean5. The hotel is entirely non smoking6. It is close the all the union square attractions and on the street car line!7. The hotel tries to be environmentally friendly encouraging recycling and reusing. 8. The over head fan and the window make things comfortable. Trust me you won't miss the A/C and you might actually have to use the space heater depending on the the time of the year you are there.9. There is fruit, tea/coffee, cookies and muffins in the lobby and restaurant too.10. The rates were affordable !I had a great stay. I am looking forward to going back to San Francisco in the future just so I can stay at the Chancellor again!

<Content>Good price  We stayed at The Chancellor for 6 nights at the start of a trip around California. We picked it because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. The hotel is not fancy, or luxurious but the furniture in our room was obviously quite new and the maids kept everything spotless. The room was quite compact but we spent so little time in it we really didn't mind.It's a very nice touch that they have free coffee in the lobby, and all of the staff we encountered were friendly. The area just behind the lobby where the tea and coffee is served is a little bit dark and some people may find it slightly off-putting on arrival but it's really no reflection on the rooms (ours was actually very bright and quiet) so reserve judgment.The area around Union Square is not one of the many really nice neighbourhoods that SF has to offer but it's so well placed for all buses, cable cars, BART, etc.that it actually is perfectly placed to explore a variety of them during your stay.As I said, not a fancy choice, but a dependable, clean and reasonably priced one slap-bang in the middle of the city.

<Content>Honestly--This Is A Great Hotel I chose this hotel as for my budget it was the top rated hotel-No 5,and every positive report seen was true.We had an e-mail the day before we travelled to confirm room would be ready,so no nasty shocks upon arrival, cannot find booking and full.---great PR that e-mail.The staff at reception upon arrival were friendly and helpful and our room 1400(I reqested a high room when booking in January), was clean and airy. The furniture was clean and the beds were very comfortable with good mattresses and most important of all the bed linen was pristine whiteThe bathroom was very clean and well supplied with a few extras like cotton balls and buds and tissues and of course the YELLOW DUCK.In the room too we had a small room off,for cases, hanging spaces, an ironing board, umbrella and safe.The TV was good with stacks of channelsand we also had a modern alarm clock into which you could plug your MP player.Down stairs you have a lobby,bar and resturant with FREE tea or coffee and cookies from mid afternoon till evening time.The staff were very friendly (especially Mao in the resturant-a little gem) and all were very proffesional in they're jobs .The location of the hotel is a plus point too, being only 250 yards from Bart station, overlooking Union Square with all the best shops you could wish for nearby and a cable car stop outside the hotel. This hotel has been set up and run to care for its clients and it does so in a very efficient manner, I will, upon my return to SF hopefully in not too distant future, return to this hotel , not bothering to look elsewhere. I can say honestly, hand on heart this establishment is a credit to the city and I would without question recommend it to anyone.Read reports in Tripadvisor about other hotels--rip offs, dodgy areas, paperthin walls and torn dirty bed linen---you will get nothing like that here---what they promise in the brochures is exactly what you get and delivered in a friendly proffesional manner.

<Content>Better than expected!! We just got back last night from SF where we stayed 4 days at the Chancellor Hotel and loved the accommodations!!! After reading many reviews on TA we were prepared and knew some of what to expect. Once we got there, our room wasn't as small as we expected! We compared the hotel to being on a cruise ship - and actually the cruiseship rooms are smaller than ours was - no big deal. The beds were, yes, so comfortable and fluffy - my husband wants to buy sheets like theirs now :) And every person part of the Chancellor staff was so friendly and answered our endless amount of questions. We will definitely stay here again!!!

<Content>Loved it - great value. My husband and I stayed at the hotel from April 2-6 as a fun stop before a trip to another city. After a very long and terrible day of air travel, the friendly woman at the front desk was efficient and gave us supplies as our luggage did not make it with us. Our room was stylish, clean and comfortable. It was not small considering the age of the hotel. Throughout our stay, the staff with whom we interacted (front desk, housekeeping, bell, concierge) were all very friendly and helpful. At one time, I called the guest services line for help connecting to the internet - it's free by the way - and they were so helpful, the young woman offered to come to my room to help. I have stayed at many more expensive hotels, including one in Union Square, but I have never written a review until now - probably because I chose The Chancellor from other reviews on this site and feel like I now have to pass it on - its charming details are abundant and it is a great value.

<Content>Good value, right near the shopping We weren't too fussed about our stay in San Francisco. We were only there for 2 nights, after a big trip from NYC and Las Vegas, that we wanted a more toned down hotel, but was close to transport and the shops. And the Chancellor Hotel did it's job. The front desk was always very helpful, and provided us with as much assistance as they could, especially when it came around to booking our airport transfer. The lady at the bookings area was a bit scary - I can understand why people feel like they're being harrassed. But she does a good job at telling you as much as you need to know. Although, we found it a bit annoying when trying to book for Alcatraz, and she said she had been waiting on the line for hours, and no one had picked up the phone, when we got through straight away on our mobile! The room was slightly smaller than we thought, but it did it's job. There's a good size wardrobe to put your suitcases, even though we didn't use it. The bathroom is also on the small size, but does it job as well. All parts of our room was clean. The only thing I can say is that there is an ice machine opposite the lifts, which was in front of our room. So that was a bit noisy at times.In terms of location - it was perfect. The cable car went by right outside, which was handy to get to Fisherman's Wharf, or over to Westfield Shopping Centre. Union Square is just outside as well, but do be careful as there are quite a lot of beggers (especially on Market Street - it's very very scary!). Chinatown is a good 10-15 minute walk (up a steep hill!). Right outside, you could see Macy's, Victoria's Secret, and around the corner Nike, Tiffany  Co, Gucci, etc. Heaven for shoppers!In the end, for the money we paid, it was definitely worth the stay.

<Content>Loved the Chancellor! We stayed one night at the Chancellor and enjoyed the great location, access to the trolley, room, and delicious breakfast. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room, located on the backside, was very quiet while our friends' room, located on the front side, was noisy with trash trucks visiting at various time during the night. Try and request a room off the street. Check the website for specials. The Chancellor is a great value and lived up to its reputation on Tripadvisor.

<Content>good enough hotel Stayed there for only a day and a night , in transit. Overall, it was, as I said, good enough, though a little pricey for an old hotel( had a cheaper stay at Grand Residences Marriott at Lake Thaoe and it was a fantastic studio ), but then again this is SFO. The room is clean and well maintained. The corridors were narrow and the elevator was small. Bear in mind though to request a room with aircon. I was shocked that the room did not have one. Even if the weather is not hot, I wanted an aircon so I can close the windows. As a result, we kept the window open and it was so noisy outside ( cable car noise, some construction)... I think this is one of the setbacks. It has a good location though and a very good view. The reviews were so great I was a little disappointed.Will I stay there again? I'll have to think about it.

<Content>Prime Location  My girlfriend found the Chancellor through TripAdvisor, and after looking at a few other places, she and I decided this was the place for us. After our stay in late March, early April, we are not disappointed. The hotel was clean, the staff was nice (willing to help with whatever we asked - be it directions, advice, etc), and the location is excellent for access to the cable cars, buses, Chinatown, the financial district, and of course, Union Square. There is a coffee shop next door, and a Walgreens just up the block. We bought our MUNI pass at the desk (the 3 day pass was the best for us). The rooms are small, but not tight. You have a large closet, a comfortable bed, and you can even pick from a number of pillow types (down, fiber, poly, buckwheat, bead, etc) at no extra cost (I've never seen this before - and it was a nice feature). We couldn't get the internet to work for us, but that wasn't really an issue since 1) we didn't need to get online much and 2) they have a computer/printer in the lobby for your use. The staff worked to get our computer up and running on their wireless (and would have done more if we had wanted). All in all, the cost of the hotel is not the cheapest in town, but the value is very high due to location, amenities, and the overall price-point of everything in SF. If we don't stay here again, it would only be because we wanted to try another part of town - we have no complaints about the hotel.

<Content>Great location, reasonably priced, good service I abandonned our booking for Diva Hotel when I read the Trip Advisor Reviews of it and opted for Chancellor Union Square instead - much cheaper and consistently good reviews. The hotel is in a great location and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant (especially the decorator who was working on our floor that week - a really nice gent) . We asked for a quiet room and couldn't hear any traffic noise at all, so slept soundly. The hotel is quite old fashioned (in a nice kind of way) and its age and size inevitably make maintenance and upgrading a huge job, so don't expect perfection. Nonetheless it is clean and tidy and things like the bed linen were of good quality. My only (minor) criticism was that in the twin room we had there was rather too much furniture for the size of the room, which made it feel a bit cramped - there was actually ample room with a kind of separate storage room/cupboard, but things like arm chairs and coffee tables in the main bedroom made it feel a bit corwded and you couln't really sit at them easily and comfortably. All in all good value and a good experience. Thought the warning leaflet in the hotel about cancer risks from chips and burgers was hilarious - symptom of the litigatious culture in USA. We had a great time in SF - we walked up adn down all those hills through most of the very distinct neighbourhoods. However, we were shocked by how many destitute people there are on the streets. Most seemed to be have mental health issues and weren't in anyway threatening - it is just startling to see this in the richest country in the world.

<Content>Great Value  We had a great stay at the Chancellor. Yes, the rooms  bathroom are small but for 2 people, our room was just fine. The location is outstanding. It is steps from Union Square and is near public transportation (F-line, cable car). Chinatown is an easy walk from the Chancellor. The rates for a room were very reasonable compared to the other hotels in the area. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant and it was very good. The service at the hotel was also good. We asked them for some recommendations, directions,  etc. and they were always responsive and friendly. Parking is a concern in this area so I would advise purchasing parking as part of the hotel package. There is a garage that the hotel uses around the corner. Also around the corner is the complementary health club guests may use. It was a nice place for a free workout. Very clean, up to date facility.They do not have air conditioning at this hotel so I'm not sure what it would be like in the summer. We were here in the early Spring so it wasn't an issue. We would stay at the Chancellor again!

<Content>Why stay anywhere else? Just returned from a week in the Bay Area and the Chancellor was everything we hoped for. San Francisco is an expensive city and the Chancellor has to be the best deal in town. I mean, seriously, for $128/night to stay in a CLEAN, comfortable room right in the heart of the city! You've got to be kidding me. I've stayed in smaller, dirty rooms for twice as much in NYC and London.The location is perfect. The trolley stops literally right outside the door, and there are hundreds of places to eat and drink in the Union Square area, not to mention all the shopping right across the street. If you are renting a car to go out to wine country, all the major rental places have pick-up locations right around the corner. This is great news if you don't want to pay for a car at the airport and park it in a garage for a couple of days while you're in the City.The staff was super friendly, from Rory at check-in to I think it was Matt who helped us with our bags. Everyone had a smile and a nice comment whenever they interacted with guests.Room size was fine....just as advertised. Clean and comfortable with plenty of hot water. If you are spending all your time in your hotel room while in San Francisco then you are missing out on a great city.I wouldn't even think of staying anywhere else. There is no reason to. Clean, convenient, affordable and really good free cookies. The Chancellor is a great base for exploring San Francisco.

<Content>Fantastic stay at the Chancellor Hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel April 2  3. We chose this hotel after reviewing many SF hotels through Tripadvisor. Our trip to SF wasn't a pleasure getaway persay, as I had an appointment at the Comprehensive Cancer Center at UCSF. Although we were in San Francisco for medical reasons the Chancellor Hotel made our trip so pleasant. There was a very informative gentleman working the front desk (Mike) when we arrived. He was so helpful in giving us information about the public transportaion...he gave us the bus number to catch to get to my appointment...explained how to get to the bus stop  how to purchase the muni passes (thanks, Mike!). I would highly reccomend the Chancellor. The staff is great, the rooms are clean, the beds are amazingly comfortable  I love the pillow service! They have a list of different types of pillows to choose from, you call the front desk with your preference  they are brought to your room. Nice touch!We had a cocktail in the lounge our first night there  the bartender was super friendly. My husband was craving Italian food and she reccomended a little Italian restaurant that was out of this world good. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning and it was really good as well. The Sears restaurant next door has an amazing breakfast too.Overall, we were more than pleased with our stay at the Chancellor Hotel. Hopefully, the next time we are back it is strictly for pleasure (no medical appointments).Thank you Chancellor!

<Content>Chancellor - why go anywhere else? Overall - great for location, staff efficiency and friendliness, price and convenience. Would we recommend it? - YES - I can see no reason to stay anywhere else. In fact we have already passed on the details to friends and family who will be there next month. Why did we choose the Chancellor? 鈥?from the great reviews on Trip Advisor.The details of our stay ....We had a 5 day stay at the Chancellor Hotel in March 2008 - 3 days before we left for Las Vegas/Grand Canyon and 2 days on our return. The location and the service were first class -- we had front rooms on both occasions and it was just magic to be able to hear the SF cable cars as they passed within a few feet on the hotel - there is a stop in both directions just steps from the door - making it easy to get to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf etc. The rooms might be on the smallish side 鈥?but we did not intend to stay in the rooms for long and we knew this beforehand from previous reviews. Some nice toiletries in the bathrom saved us buying when we got there, although there was a Wallgreens just 2 minutes away which stocked anything a visitor could need,We had great views of Union Square - with Macy's and the Levis Store about 4 minutes away. Down on Market (10 minutes walk downhill or 4 mins. on the cable car) was a huge Mall with all the usual US stores -- a great place to exercise your credit card!The staff were unbelievable -- because we were on a 5-hour city tour when we needed to check in on-line for our SWA flight to LV - Shamina on the front desk did all this work for us and our boarding passes were at the desk when we returned that evening and she also checked our final flight time home with the airport a few days later, and changed the time of a Lorries Shuttle pick-up for us. Thank you Shamina. We were able to leave a bag in the hotel while we flew east and picked it up on our return -- very handy as it saved us carrying too much weight on the internal flight. Also as it was my birthday when there -Wes Tyler had arranged for a bottle of champagne and a gift in the room - thank you Wes! The convenience of having the restaurant on the ground floor for a large US breakfast and the bar in the evening for aperitifs was great. The bar closes early but we were able to stop on walk home from dinner for our nightcaps! Muni passes can be bought from Suzie in the lobby and there is an ATM machine in the lobby too. We bought our last two Lorries Shuttle vouchers from Suzie too.Thank you to all at the Chancellor and yes 鈥?we will be back!

<Content>Did not live up to the reviews My boyfriend and I were very excited to stay at the Chancellor based on the great reviews here. The front desk staff did their jobs but didn't seem like they wanted to be there, i.e. no smiles, not quite friendly. Also, the woman working the info/tourist desk practically assaulted us trying to give us brochues when all we really wanted to do was get to our room. If we want info we'll come to you.The room was what I expected based on the reviews. While I did know that there would be no A/C I did not know that there would be no screens on the windows. Unfortunately, we had a few flying bug guests staying with us that night.We were only booked for 2 nights and the second night when we returned after a long day of sightseeing, we saw that our room had not been made up. We spoke to the front desk and they appologized and brought some extra pillows but really to me that is inexcusable. I know people make mistakes but we were really annoyed.While the hotel is in a good location and was clean I would try a different one next time in SF.

<Content>Great Hotel in a great location We really enjoyed our stay at the Chancellor. The staff was superb. The rooms are not very large (as one would expect for a classic hotel of this age), but they are clean and modernized - more than enough room for people who want to enjoy SF by day and only need a comfortable place to relax and sleep. The only real complaint is that the bathrooms are small and hard to accommodate two people getting ready at once. But the ambiance, and more importantly the friendly, attentive, courteous staff make up for any of it's few shortcomings.The following warning does not reflect in any way The Chancellor Hotel:San Francisco is a wonderful place full of adventure and history but there is a professional criminal element alive and well. My wife was pick pocketed during our stay on one of the cable car stops. It was a professional set up involving multiple people and was executed with perfection. The San Francisco police will not respond to a non-violent crime, so they are free to operate unabated. We had to fill out a police report ONLINE! So please be careful, as this completely ruined our stay and really turned our opinion about this seemingly wonderful city.

<Content>Love this place! WOW! We stayed in this hotel for three nights over Easter weekend. We were traveling with our older teenagers and college aged son and needed three rooms. The price was incredible! Check their website for deals! Total for all three rooms combined averaged about $450 each night. The off site parking (around the block) was $22/day. We booked two rooms with 2 twin beds and one room with a queen bed. The rooms are on the small side and the bathrooms are small. The furnishings are very nice as is the decor in the rooms. Not dingy or dirty but extremely clean, bright and on the newer side. If you want a hotel that is upscale and don't mind the small rooms (we were hardly in them). This is the place! You absolutely cannot beat the price or location. If you want a view, you need to ask. Some of the rooms in the back don't have great views, but we were on the 12th floor and our window looked out towards Union Square. I would recommend it for a shopping/dining getaway weekend (save your money for shopping and dining.) This is a great find. We've stayed at the Westin St. Francis and Stanford Court before (without kids) and I would stay here again without them. I don't believe the rooms have air conditioning, but there were ceiling fans in the rooms and there aren't many times you need a/c in San Francisco any way!!! Give it a try! WOW!

<Content>Staff friendly but hotel rooms a bit tatty Recently stayed at the Chancellor as part of a large group. We booked 7 hotel rooms in total. On arrival we checked in and the girls on reception were really helpful, however only 2 of the 7 rooms were ready for us. We were disappointed as it was after 2pm so we did expect the rooms to be ready, so we ended up dumping all the baggage in the 2 rooms so we could go out.All the rooms were really small and as 2 of the rooms had babies in them and therefore needed cribs (which resembled something out of a orphanage but were clean and comfortable) there wasn't much room at all. Although reception were pleasant and helpful they did not really allocate the rooms acording to who was staying in them, as the largest room was given to one of our group who was staying on his own rather than being given to the family who has a baby. So we swapped rooms between ourselves.We stayed in room 906 whcih was clean and tidy and had a bowl of sweets, which was a nice touch. However the bathroom was old and tatty and in need of some renovation, also I was convinced I could smell vomit in the room. The location of the hotel is very close to Union Square which is excellent for shops. Howvever there seems to be a lot of homeless people hanging around this area, (much more than when I visited San Fran a few years ago) this was very intimidating at night, so next time I would be tempted to stay near the Wharf rather than Union Square.The hotel lobby has free tea and coffee and cookies (which were lovely) and there was a residents bar which did great cocktails - however this closed really early (around 9.30pm) which was a bit disapointing.Had breakfast once in the hotel and the fried eggs over easy were delish!. Also there is a fab restaurant next door that did fantastic fillet steak.All in all I enjoyed it but would not stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful Stay at the Chancellor Just got back from our California coastal trip starting in San Francisco at the Chancellor. I chose our 4 different hotels, including the Chancellor, after reading great reviews consistently on all on Trip Advisor. The Chancellor was everything and more that we thought it would be - very clean, centrally located, with very friendly and helpful staff. After reading reviews on Trip Advisor, we knew the rooms were smallish, that there was no a/c, and that the hotel was an older boutique style establishment, none of which negatively impacted our stay in any way. I would recommend the Chancellor to everyone.

<Content>Oldie But Goodie I have to echo the many other favorable comments about service and value. If you are staying in SF and need access to the business district this is the one. (I travel worldwide and stay in many expensive five star hotels.)My colleague needed a razor after the hours of the small hotel gift store and the clerk immediately sent out for one and it was brought to his room.Although the clerks were not too knowledgeable when I asked about restaurants with specific cuisines both clerks offered to help with one handing me a Zagat book and the other looking up information on the computer.The waitress at the breakfast restaurant anticipated my needs perfectly.The hotel is about 94 years old so don't expect contemporary and fancy decor, but do expect a very fine intermediate level business class hotel.I noticed that the hotel displayed 2005 and 2006 awards from Tripadvisor. I expect that the award for 2007 is in the mail.

<Content>You did it again, Wes!!! Wes, you are the man! You have to be the best general manager of a hotel property in the country! You and your staff are absolutely the greatest. For those of you reading this review--stay at the Chancellor when you visit SF---don't waste your time looking at other properties. You want convenience? You'll be right in the middle of the Union Square action, literally less than 50 feet from a cable car stop. You want value? At the Chancellor, you'll pay less than half of what you'd pay at most of the places around the Square. You want a competent staff? These folks actually say hello when they get on the elevator with you, and they act like they enjoy trying to help you. You want a place with character? You'll love the deep tubs, cozy rooms, and the rubber ducky you get to take home with you. Not to mention the delicious cookies and coffee available all day long.Yes, the rooms are small, but how much space do you need, anyway? No air conditioning, but how often do you need it in SF, anyway? Believe me, this place offers a more than merely comfortable stay.This was our second stay--we enjoyed our first one (2 years ago) so much, that we came back and brought our kids and their spouses with us. Wes made sure we had three rooms together, with great views from the 15th floor. The kids loved the place, too!I can't end the review without thanking the Chancellor folks for helping us have a great family trip! Wes, you did it again!

<Content>Very Satisfied My wife and I spent a week at the Chancellor and we were very satisfied with the stay. Based on what I had read about SF hotels, I was expecting a small room - it was smaller that what I would expect in, say, Chicago but was candidly larger than I had been led to believe.I would say that the pro's are (1) the terrific staff, (2) a great location (3) a clean, bright room and (4) a very competitive price. I had a problem with my internet access due to a switchover in the hotel's wireless network and the staff bent over backwards to get me back online. My rate of $160 per night (AARP) was at least a third less than the nearby Hyatt where I attended a conference. We used the 7-day passport (MUNI) at $24 pp (a bargain) and the Chancellor's location provided great access to the routes that we required. I also introduced myself to the GM (Wes) who frequently posts on here to let him know that TA steered me his way. The only negative that we noted was thin walls - we could pretty easily hear our neighbors (and quickly concluded that they could hear us too!).My wife and I both concur that we would not hesitate to rebook at the Chancellor if/when we return to SF.

<Content>Excellent base for all our needs My mother and I stayed here on our trip to San Francisco and we had an excellent experience, I contacted the manager directly and asked for a room high up with a view of union square and we got exactly as we asked for.Our room was small but spotless and very cosy as we found that the nights got quite cold in San Fran.The bed was so comfy and the room was cleaned everyday.We had breakfast in the tea room that they had and it was very good, there was a lot of hype about sears a couple of doors up but it was expensive and as we usually just eat a typical british breakfast ie tea and toast,the Chancellor was much cheaper and more pleasant as we didnt feel rushed.The free tea, coffee and fruit etc in the reception came in handy.Susie who works at the tours desk was most pleasant she was very helpful in organising our trips and always had a smile on her face, infact all of the staff we encountered were friendly and very aproachable.The location was excellent we are shop-a-holics and all the stores we needed were on our doorstep ,we were not far from a huge mall which was great for cheap eats,and meant we could drop our heavy bags back to the hotel and return to the shops to burn the credit card a bit more!I would recommend this friendly hotel to anyone wanting a bit of san franciscos charm and to get a real feeling of how friendly the people are in this wonderful city, I will go back some day and will not hesitate to stay in the chancellor again.

<Content>Great Location! Check in was very efficient even though we arrived early the staff were very helpful and arranged for our luggage to be stored and for car parking for us.The location was excellent - cable car right outside and with Sears opposite and Macy's down one block you couldn't ask for anything more!The room was big enough with a large comfy bed and they have a selection of pillows available (e.g. anti snoring!) but the pillows which were already on the bed were fine.The bathroom was quite small but clean and all you needed.Our room was at the back so was quiet but I could imagine the front of the hotel could be a bit noisy.Free internet in reception and wireless in the roomsVery handy tour desk in the foyer which sells Muni passes for the cable cars/trams etc.All in all a great hotel which I would definitely stay in again.

<Content>Perfect stay Had a perfect stay at the Chancellor. Location is right in the middle of everything. Staff VERY helpful and very friendly.Rooms are small, but still sufficient. And I prefer to use the bathroom by myself, not at the same time with my partner. For one occupant at a time there is plenty of room in the bathroom. Didn't miss air condition at all, there is a fan which was not even needed at the time of my stay. Open window during night....and as to the street noise: well, you choose the location (heart of the city), so how come people still expect no street sounds??The pillow service was a very nice touch! They offer about 10 different pillows to choose from.....so take your pick.I had had the package that included parking. Sutter garage is very close and once you have reached the garage they park your car for you.... Would definitely stay at the Chancellor again! Xenia from Germany.

<Content>Average My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights after a wedding in Las Vegas.First problem was unloading the car outside, there was nowhere to park.Next problem was when booking in, we were informed there was a mistake in the price that we paid directly to the Hotel some 4 months in advance, we were told that it was an extra $160 to pay.Why in the previous 4 months they could not have informed us is anyones guess, so paying the extra was a big let down.Finally when we stopped off in the bar on our last night for a drink we were told the bar was closed, it was 10.45pm.We went out to another bar and lo and behold on getting back at 12 midnight the bar was open.All in all a nice hotel but our experience was soured

<Content>Great hotel, great price Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Chancellor. Very good location and a very good price. Staff was helpful, rooms were clean and well appointed. The pillow menu and in-room 'spa' options were a nice touch (but not used). As mentioned in previous posts there is no AC but it was not required. Rooms do have a ceiling fans to circulate air and the window does open. The free wi-fi and in-room safe was a nice bonus as well. The Powell-Hyde cable car line runs right infront of the hotel, Chinatown and Union Square are within walking distance too --Saturday we walked from the hotel, through Chinatown, then all the way to Pier 39. Will stay again.

Lovely staff, excellent location, low rates. You'll have to accept a bit of noise during the night due to garbage trucks (as far as I could guess). Conclusion: I will definately be coming back to this hotel if I get the chance to go to San Francisco again.

<Content>Excellent Stay at the Chancellor We recently spent a long weekend at the Chancellor hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff is very professional and courteous. The location is great as it is close to Union Square and the Powell Street Bart Station  Muni stops (Cable Cars, F-Line streetcars, and buses). You can easily walk to the hotel from there. So you can take the BART from either Oakland or San Francisco airport and get off at Powell Street and the hotel is less than 1/3rd of a mile away.The room was comfortable for two people. It was very clean and maintains the charm of an historic building. The bathroom is small with good space utilization. We asked for a room on a higher floor and stayed on the 12th floor (there are 15 floors). You could hear the street noise with the window open but it wasn鈥檛 bad at all. I had my laptop with me and the Free WiFi service was easy to use in the room. There is also a computer with an internet connection  printer in the lobby for guests to use.We ate breakfast at the restaurant which had excellent food and service; a great way to start the day. We would definitely stay at the Chancellor again, however due to the lack of air conditioning we would only stay during cooler weather.

<Content>Small with NO Air Con The hotel is in the middle of downtown which is great if you are looking for the downtown city life and not the cute charm of San Fran. The hotel's curbside passenger loading parking was full which made check in a pain because it is located on a very busy street. Once in the check-in was fine. The room however was very small and the bathroom was Tiny. The decor was nice but it looked more like a surface renovation than a deep clean renovation. New Paint, and some trendy decor doesn't change the overall feel or quality. Pillows were horrible and left me with a neck cramp the next day! The worst part of the hotel is that it doe not have any air conditioning! again, no air conditioning. Being that san fran is usually cool you wouldn't think it would be a problem, but when we open the windows the street noise was so loud we could not sleep, and with the windows shut it became very stuffy. Seriously, what kind of hotel does not have air. I had a different hotel booked the next night and called them at 8am the next morning and they let me check in early because I couldn't even imagine getting ready in the tiny bathroom at the Chancellor. My husband and I could barely fit in the bathroom at the same time and we are very small people! No counter space either. My advice is book a hotel in an area with more charm, unless you want to be downtown, then i would suggest a hotel with Air conditioning! I do not recommend this hotel. save your money.

<Content>great location/sensational service On arrival we were greated warmly, and the check in process was easy. They even offered to store out ski bags without being asked to.Rooms were compact, yet very clean.Location cannot be beat, with Union sq across the road and the cable car stop outside the door. If shopping is your thing, you cannot be located anywhere better.The staff went out of thier way to make us feel welcome, offering advice on local attractions, local restaurants, booking tours and advising us on ways to save a dollar or two on transport etc.Hotel restaurant only open for breakfast and lunch, and the breakfasts wereplentiful and resonably priced.Hotel bar is cosy, and a great place to have a quiet drink before heading out for dinner, the bar staff always offering ideas on what is on and available for the tourist.This is a hotel where you get value for moneyWould definatly reccomend to anybody staying in San Francisco.I cannot fault this hotel.

<Content>loved the Chancellor My husband and I just spend 5 nights at the Chancellor Hotel and loved it. Our room the first night was rather noisy with it being street side on the second floor. We asked about being moved to a quieter room the next day and they did it with no problem whatsoever. The front desk clerks were all helpful; one of the girls even printed my boarding passes for me since I would be out and about when the time came to do it on line!The complimentary tea/coffee/cookies/popcorn in the lobby was great as were the complimentary newspapers.The room was nice, big enough for two, with a great shower!The hotel has a nice little bar/lounge.The location is wonderful. Access to the trolley car, street cars, buses, etc were all within minutes.We loved it and would stay there again.

The room was small but not so small as to be a problem, with a huge closet and a comfortable bed. Everything looked very nice. There were no noise problems from within the hotel, though anything overlooking Union Square will have street noise. On the whole, finding this place was a big win.

My days in SF were planned in the restaurant over breakfast 鈥?both the food and atmosphere are wonderful. And although I had purchased maps and guidebooks the hotel placemat became my most used map that when everywhere with me.The hotel is charming and the reality was better than I expected.

<Content>Just spent 6 nights in this fantastic hotel! I was in San Fran for the NADA convention and was notified by our VP of Marketing that we were staying at the Chancellor. Uh-oh I thought to myself. No brand name hotel? Being a constant business traveler, I usually like the brands because I know what to expect.Wow. The Chancellor made me realize my expectations were pretty low! I was extremely impressed with this place. The hotel is beautiful- although it's old, it has been fully refurbished and is absolutely pristine. The guest rooms and the lobby are filled with character. The rooms are beautifully furnished and they are absolutely spotless. I'm a slob and the maid removed all evidence the mess I created every single day. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the free in-room WiFi was icing on the cake.I was most deeply impressed by the staff of the hotel. I didn't catch names, but every person who helped me was oustanding. I was amazed when my breakfast was brought up to my room and the person who delivered it started asking me how I like the room and then explained how it had been completely redone. This was a great indication of the pride this person felt in the Chancellor- if you're going to engage me in a chat about how the room was redone while you deliver my breakfast, you're obviously pretty proud to be working there.That sums up my experience with the Chancellor- everyone seemed to be proud to be there and the ruboff of that pride was excellent service all around. It was so great to get to experience a city like San Francisco while staying in a hotel like The Chancellor. I am now looking to return to San Francisco with my wife and family for leisure. If we do, The Chancellor will have first right of refusal of my business. Nice work! I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location My husband and I stayed at The Chancellor for four nights in September as part of our honeymoon having travelled from the UK to get married in Las Vegas. I e-mailed Wes in advance and when we arrived we found that we had been allocated a two room suite with two bathrooms which was absolutely fab with views across Union Square.The staff at the hotel are absolutely great. Prior to our stay here we had been at The Venetian in Las Vegas and whilst the rooms there are superb you just feel like a number. When we arrived at The Chancellor the receptionist made a point of agknowledging the fact that it was our honeymoon and the staff made you feel truly welcome.This was my second stay in San Francisco and I really think you would struggle to beat this hotel. For the few on here that have left negative comments they need to consider what you should realistically expect from a 3 star hotel at these rates. The hotel is in a first class location, the rooms are spotlessly clean and the staff attentive, I don't know what some people want however I honestly think you will struggle to find a better hotel than this.The tram stops right outside the hotel and in the evening we were able to walk everywhere without having to take a cab. San Francisco is a buzzing city and we throughly enjoyed our stay. I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel and only wish we had met Wes in person to thank him. If you are reading this review whilst shopping around for a hotel stop looking and just book the chancellor as it's a gem.

<Content>Great Value Stayed here Feb 1-3 because of the top 10 rank on this site. And we agree, it's a very nice hotel, especially for the price (we shopped and it was half what we would have had to pay at the St. Francis one block away). Clean room, very comfortable bed, efficient staff, great location. Rooms are small, and we took out and used the space heater that was in the closet. But free Wi-Fi in the room, free cookies, coffee and newspapers in the lobby, and free access to a very nice regular health club 1 block away (not some cheesy fitness room with 2 machines, a TV and a water cooler) make this a great deal, especially if you get a promotional rate. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Incredible Staff,Terrific Stay We chose the Chancellor based on reviews on this site and management responses and were totally happy and impressed with our choice. Every staff member was genuinely concerned with our comfort and patient with our requests for directions and restaurant recommendations. Rex and Alicia in the bar were gracious, funny, and informative; the housekeepers were quite pleasant and extremely thorough, and the front desk staff were quick and efficient without being curt.  The location is excellent, easy to acess public transportation, shopping, and a great selection of restaurants. Our stay here was the highlight of our 3 city vacation and we'll be sure to stay here again on our next trip. Great job Mr. Tyler!

<Content>We were impressed We are semi-locals who live two hours from San Francisco and come into the city 8 or 10 weekends a year, for playsThe Chancellor was not new to us, but we had not stayed there for several years, partly because we only stay for one night on the weekend, and partly because I use a consolidator kind of thing to find the hotels with the best parking deals.We had a midweek matinee and a good parking deal at the Chancellor, so we decided to go back, which I had hoped to do anyway because of all of the wonderful recent reviews and I wanted to see the room refurbishing. We decided to make it a two night stay.There are two main things which impressed me, especially as compared to the myriad hotels in San Francisco that we have visited over the years.The first is the staff. I swear that the general manager, WesTyler, must have trained this staff in customer relations. Or else they are just genuinely great people...they don't ACT trained, it seems genuine. The front desk clerks are smart, efficient, friendly, and alert. The bellboys keep track of when your room is ready if you arrive early and efficiently keep track of various people's luggage. both checking in and checking out. The woman at the Tour Desk (which we did not use) is available for questions and help...she is probably the equivalent of a 'concierge' in a larger hotel. (She will also laugh with you when you come in from the rain soaking wet.)The staff in the restaurant is not only efficient and attentive, but cheery and fun. They really seem to enjoy what they are doing and always wish you a good day when you leave.If you run into a member of the housekeeping staff in the hallway as you are entering or leaving your room, you can always count on a greeting with a smile, ...good morning...for example.The refurbished rooms are delightful, with a classy decor, beds and linens and comforters you wish you could take home with you.SO....this is an older hotel, brought up to boutique/charming style. Don't expect 300 square foot rooms, air conditioning, huge modern bathrooms. You may find a welcome walk-in closet. You will not have air-conditioning, but you will have a window which opens and a ceiling fan to circulate the air. Actually, you will need not to worry about A/C at all in SF.You will need to worry about heat, if you are in your room during the day on cold days. The hotel has an efficient way of turning on the heat at about 5 o'clock in the evening and turning it off later in the morning, but if you are in your room during the day and get cold, look in your walk-in closet you will find a modern electric 120 v radiator which you can trot out to warm your toes. It is not really a problem, just a caution for extra cold days if you plan to stay in.OKAY, Wes.....your turn. But please share what I said about your staff with them. They are truly incredible.

<Content>Good location and great staff Warm and friendly greeting by all staff which was much appreciated after a long flight. As mentioned in previous reviews this is a hotel with plenty of character, definitely not a modern box. Our room was freshly decorated and whilst a little small the walk in closet was a real bonus. Much thought had been given to the comfort of guests with the provision of such items as complimentary bottle of wine, pillow menu, umbrella (much needed in San Francisco), deep bath etc. The location couldn't be better in the heart of the city and a few steps from the cable car.The hotel breakfast we sampled was first class. Complimentary coffee, fruit and cookies were always available.Excellent hotel representing superb value for money.

<Content>Highlight of our honeymoon! We stayed at the Chancellor for 3 nights last week at the beginning of our honeymoon. We booked at this property because of the excellent reviews on this site and also because we loved Wes Tyler's smart and funny management responses. It was absolutely the right choice.We arrived at the hotel around noon, and the checkin was smooth--despite our early arrival, our room was ready within 15 minutes. The room was lovely, and there was a bottle of champagne, glasses with the Chancellor logo, and a lovely picture frame waiting for us. The front desk and concierge staff were friendly and gave excellent directions to all the places we wanted to go. The coffee and cookies in the lobby were a homey touch, and the coffee was so good I never felt the need to go in search of Peet's! We used the pillow menu (the memory foam pillows are amazing), and we asked the first day for a refrigerator, which was delivered and cold by the time we returned from lunch in Chinatown. We had drinks in the bar each night that we were there, and found Alicia to be a funny and informative barkeep. Housekeeping did a wonderful job of keeping our room clean and comfortable.The location of the hotel is terrific. It was easy to get anywhere we wanted to go, and right on the cablecar line. We were just a couple of blocks from the bus line, Chinatown, the world's largest Macy's, and a mall housing some really wonderful restaurants. We especially enjoyed our meal at Out and About, a Vietnamese restaurant. My husband and I run a 32 room inn with a full service restaurant in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, and came home with lots of ideas to improve our own guests' experience. We loved that the Chancellor provided an umbrella for our use (found in our room closet), especially since it rained for most of the time we were in San Francisco. The guest computer, complete with printer, next to the front desk was easily accessible. We had a wonderful experience staying at the Chancellor, and will definitely return. Next time we hope to meet Wes Tyler to compliment him personally for his well run hotel and excellent staff.

<Content>Love, Love, Love this Hotel I normally travel with my husband but this trip I am solo. When I checked into the Chancellor yesterday, it felt like coming home. This is probably my 10th trip to this hotel, and I would never stay anywhere else in San Francisco. One of the many reasons I enjoy this hotel is that it is a true San Francisco style hotel. It is not a large, boxy, giant roomed modern hotel. Why come to an interesting city like San Francisco and stay at a place like that? You might as well go to Vegas if that's the experience you want. This is is quaint, cozy, old school San Francisco. If you've ever looked at any of the houses or flats in the City (and I have, since I lived here for 20 years), you'll see the same sort of architecture. Things are compact here in San Francisco with interesting little touches, and that's what you'll find at the Chancellor. Yes, the rooms are small. That makes them cozy and sweet. Most of them have a gigantic closet to store your things which more than makes up for their compactness. Staying here actually makes you FEEL like you're in San Francisco. Add to that the sounds of the City floating through your room and you have a complete San Francisco experience.I can't believe someone complained about the Chancellor's decor in another review. Clearly that person should have stayed at a giant no-personality chain hotel. The Chancellor's decor is old school SAN FRANCISCO, which is what makes it so wonderful. It's also hard to believe someone would complain that they have to sign and initial the check in form! Being a hotel owner myself, I realize the need to point things out to people personally and to actually ask that they initial something to confirm they've read the point in question. Plain and simple, all of those items are important, and many people just don't take the time to read details. To the hotel, it's good business practice. To the guest, it takes an extra 3 or 4 seconds, if that. The kind of person who would take offense at that probably should have just stayed home. My husband and I have been coming to this hotel for almost two years. In that time, the faces at the hotel haven't changed a bit -- we see the entire staff time and time again. To me, that's the sign of a great establishment: essentially no staff turnover. They have always been courteous and friendly and ready to help with any request given them. We love the breakfasts in the restaurant and believe it is probably the best breakfast in the City. And the hotel prices are fabulous compared to other hotels in San Francisco. I personally can't believe they didn't win a 2008 Travelers' Choice Award this year, after having won one in the past (for Best Bargain), but then it appears that many hotels that have won awards in the past didn't win them this year. They will always be THIS traveler's choice.Keep up the great work, Chancellor. You're doing everything right. I'm here at the hotel now and will be back again in a week. See you guys again then.

<Content>A truly great bargain This is my second stay at this hotel, though this time my wife joined me, so there were two in our room. I have only good things to say about the Chancellor. This is a hotel that speaks of the caring attitude from top to bottom: ownership, management, employees. Even with two of us in the room, which is on the small side, as anyone reading reviews of this hotel is well aware, we managed without a problem. The room was quiet, clean, newly decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was reasonably priced and tasty; service was cheerful and professional. In fact, all of the staff was courteous, knowledgable and helpful (e.g., they take it as a challenge to get you online via their WIFI system, which I am finding is difficult to do with Microsoft's Vista software, but they persisted in helping me -- and succeeded, more than I can say about the other, much more expensive, hotel where we stayed on this trip). In a city like San Francisco, what more does one really need? In fact, many of the more expensive hotels we have been to could learn a lot by observing the efforts that everyone associated with the Chancellor makes to help you enjoy your trip. By the way, if you wish to have a quiet and peaceful room (though without a view), request one in the back.

<Content>Great location and friendly staff The best thing about the hotel was the location - very close to Union Square, MUNI and AMTRAK connections as well. The check in staff were helpful and courteous. There is no dinner or room service but there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby that you can walk to safely at night (which could not be said of all locations in SF!!) The room didn't have a coffee maker in it. The hotel breakfast was OK - service was good but you could probably get a better breakfast and at cheaper price from one of the local cafes.The room itself was small but clean and in good condition. The bathroom was very small indeed. I think the whole set up would be a bit crowded with two people.The free WiFi was a bonus. The hotel web site has a link to Lorrie's Shuttle service from the San Francisco International airport which was convenient too.I would stay there again.

<Content>Great location, good value Stayed here for 2 nights in January 2008.I had a renovated queen room on the 4th floor for $100 a night. Location-wise, the hotel is a few steps from Union Square, so perfect for shopping and dining, which was why I chose to stay here.First impression of the hotel isn't great - hopefully they plan to renovate the lobby and elevators soon. You also have to initial about 6 different clauses when you check in, whereas with most hotels a signature and a credit card suffices. This is a petty point, but the hotel logo is also outdated and needs to be something more modern, to go with the renovations.The room itself was great. The renovation meant the room had a modern lick of paint and new modern bedroom furniture...the green was a good choice. I slept well in the bed and could have chosen from a list of 10-12 special pillows to order to my room. There was a large walk-in wardrobe/closet which made up for the size of the room, a little on the small size, and an in-room safe, which was appreciated. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been renovated for 10-20 years but was clean and I appreciated having a proper bath tub, which for the non-Americans means a tub you can bathe in up to your shoulders. Much appreciated after a long flight!With the current exchange rate, this was a very good deal for a hotel in a great location.

<Content>cozy accomodations, helpful staff I stayed at the Chancellor when I was in town for business and was very pleased to have a nice non-chain hotel with a deep bathtub and comfy attractive accomodations. The big draws for me were free wifi, location and the decent price. I had some trouble getting the wireless working properly and the desk staff were incredibly helpful and accomodating helping me get set up and making sure everything worked fine. The rooms are small but totally decent and I enjoyed the old-style bathroom especially the decent sized tub. Extra touches like the apples/cookies in the lobby and pretty botanical prints in the room made my stay here very pleasant and not another run-of-the-mill hotel stay. The bed was conmfortable with ample blankets and pillows and even an extra wool blanket in the closet which was a welcome change from all those indeterminate fuzz blankets you get at other hotels.The only two drawbacks I encountered were minor. There was no coffee maker in the room -- not a huge deal in this city with so much great coffee but it does mean you have to get dressed to have some or get room service -- and I did feel the walls seemed thin. The person in the room next to me had a cough and I felt like she was right next to me. When she was on the phone, I could hear her whole conversation. Neither was a very big deal to me but for people hypersensitive to either issue, it might be worth knowing.I've also really appreciated the general manager's responses here and getting to read his comments on his own blog. It really is the mark of someone who cares about his business and how it is being perceived and appreciated.

<Content>Wonderful Location but Basic Hotel The best thing that this hotel has going for it is its location. Situated in the middle of Union Square - the hotel was a short walking distance from all the shops and good restaurants. The hotel was probably one of the worst that we stayed in in terms of decor - it was very dated and the rooms were very small with very old bathroom facilities. When we checked in we were told we had a lovely view from our room only to discover we were looking straight into a brick wall.The staff were friendly enough but not welcoming in my opinion. They were much more friendlier in the restaurant part and served a lovely breakfast!We didn't spend too much time in the hotel because we were busy exploring all that San Francisco has to offer so the fact that the hotel wasn't great didn't really matter because the location was superb. I think if I were going back to San Francisco I would consider staying in a hotel in Fisherman's Wharf because this is where we spent most of our time. Lovely restaurant up above the Chancellor Hotel though - great food but service a bit slow!!

<Content>Great location Very convenient location - trolley stop right outside the door and handy for shops. This is an older building, so some parts were a little shabby but the room was newly decorated, the bed was large and exceptionally comfortable for the standard of room and the staff were helpful and friendly. Restaurant and bar a bit limited but for the price paid per room, their charges were perfectly reasonable and there was always free coffee in the lobby - nice touch. Would stay there again.

<Content>Perfect end to our Honeymoon. We stayed at the Chancellor Hotel from 15th - 18th Oct '07 as the end to our Honeymoon. It was perfect. We arrived at about 10pm and were greeted by friendly and professional staff. Our room was great - nice size and clean. A bottle of sparkling wine, a gift and a credit voucher for the restaurant had been left in our room. A lovely touch. We had a view over Union Square too. Front desk staff were able to direct us to a great cafe (Uncle V.... - can't quite remember the name) for a late night pizza - their recommendation was spot on.On our first morning the lady at the info shop in the hotel was so informative and helpful - without her help i'm not sure we would have got to the Golden gate Bridge on the local bus!We experienced room service - both breakfast and dinner, which was fabulous. We also ate breakfast in the restaurant on two mornings - again great.We had a drink in the bar each night before heading out - friendly staff.All in all it was the perfect end to our honeymoon - i wish we had spent longer in San Francisco as we only touched the surface of things to see and do.We are planning a return trip in 2009 and will definatly stay at The Chancellor. It has a wonderful location, the staff are excellent, rooms are great and the little touches show the thought that has gone into the service provided. I loved the rubber duck in the bathroom!!What more can i say except thank you to everyone at The Chancellor and we shall see you in 2009.

<Content>Excellent older hotel in a prime location Stayed for 6 nights in November in a top floor room away from Powell Street. The room was spotlessly clean, average size and reasonably appointed. Even with the window open there were no noise issues. Rooms have no airconditioning but do have effective ceiling fans which was fine for my stay - sometimes its good to get fresh air! I found the staff to be excellent, friendly and very helpful at all times. I didn't eat in the restaurant, so I can't comment on that.Overall I have to say the Chancellor is exceptional value, especially given its prime location. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

The location was awesome...close to shopping and great food, the trolley, and within walking distance of the bay. The staff was friendly and the room had just been redecorated and was great. They were still in the middle of renovating the other side of the floor, but we had no noise problems. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Small rooms but good hotel My wife and I stayed for four nights recently and found the hotel was good. It is advertised as all the rooms having been redocorated as recently as November '07 but the bathroom in our room looked only to have had a superficial makeover.With the date of the hotel I expected the rooms not to be of the modern size but was surprised at how tight our room was, and the bathroom was tiny.That said we enjoyed the hotel. We had one lunch in the hotel restaurant and thought the food was good, the small bar was OK and the staff very helpful. For a small break, right in the centre of SF I'd stay again, but maybe not for 4 nights again.

<Content>2nd time- Just as good After having such a good time in the Chancellor we made a quick return. You feel like you have stepped into a good quality 1950's hotel. The place hads a certsin charm which can only be experienced. The Hotel could easily be just as busy if they put the prices up $50 a night. Dont raise them though if your reading this Wes.We never tried the food in the hotel because the food in the local area was great. I would highly recommend the place next door for the best breakfast I have ever tasted. Try the pancakes. For Dinner we had good meals at the Dinner 400yrds up the same road as the Hotel.other things we loved- Free Internet useCookies and tea for free.Location,location,location- All the main shops within 800yrds of the hotel. Great bars. Right on a tram stop totake youto Fishermans warf. Mark a day off to wander down there. Staff all very plesant and helpful.Slight down sidesThe rooms are not the biggest, but due to the age and style of the building they can never be any bigger.The bar area is fine for a quiet drink, but nothing more.we will be back.

<Content>New Years In SF My wife and I stayed here over New Year's Eve and we were throughly satisfied. The room, although small when compared to most modern hotels, was very clean and very quaint. We were on the top floor with a nice view of Union Square. Note - If you don't care for traffic noise you may want a room not facing the street. The staff was very friendly and helpful and since it was New Year's Eve they had extra security measures to prevent unwanted guests into the hotel.The location of the hotel is EXCELLENT. If you are into shopping, Union Square is surrounded by big retail stores. Food-wise, we couldn't pass up Sears Fine Food (next door to the hotel) home of the little pancakes. Note - get there early (before 8am), when we left there was a line out the door! We also had dinner across the street at Scala's Bistro. It was very busy so instead of waiting 30-40min we took a seat at the bar and had dinner there. The bartenders were nice and the food was good but nothing to write home (or TripAdvisor) about.The hotel is right on the street car line which is awesome! You can make it to most of the major tourist spots on this system. Also, the hotel is a few blocks away from the Powell street BART station which is great if you are flying in and not planning to rent a car.All-in-all, I would definately recommend this place and I would stay here again.

The extra bits and bobs and friendly staff are what makes this hotel even better. The room are fairly small but all the extra touches more that make up for this.... wow super soft pillows and bed, jar of sweets in your room, free fresh cookies, tea and coffee in the reception area. Free internet access in your room and there is also the use of a computer in reception. Small bar with friendly bar staff all making this hotel special. Top tips for San Fran.Sear for breakfast almost next door to the hotel.... The line can be long but it's very fast moving.Alcatraz visit... Do the night trip 16:30 as you will get to see a bit more. Like the hospital area and the bird man's cellWorth doing.... Flying over and under the golden gate bridge by helicopter. We did this with SF Helicopter tours - Amazing experience.IMAX Cinema.... worth a trip if you love films like we do

<Content>The Only Place I Will Stay Fram Now On!! We could not ask for more!! Greeted by warm cookies and an even warmer staff, my fianc茅 and I were very pleased. Upon check-in we recieved a map and coupons for Macy's!! The lobby has a very inviting atmosphere, with a sitting area and large picture windows looking out onto the street. There is a cozy bar and restaraunt, both of which have excellent service. We ate breakfast at the restaraunt and the food was delicious!! Our server was very friendly and offered suggestions and help with any of our questions. When we got to our room we were thrilled. It had been updated in a beautiful green and chocolate brown scheme , but still retained all the important vintage touches to remind us it was a classic. Our room looked out to union square park, and at night it was so beautiful. My favorite part of our room was the HUGE closet. We could easily tuck away all of our luggage along with our purchases, allowing us to relax in a clutter free room. We were provided with nice pillows and bed linens, but there were several option available if we weren't pleased with what they provided. The bathroom was a good size with a nice deep bathtub to soak away a day of shopping. The hotel is located right off of union square, so you don't have to deal withquote as heavy foot traffic, but you are literally steps from anywhere you could want to be. Borders Books is right next door and open late if you might want something to read. All in all our experience here was an 11 out of 10, and I am so thankful our friend recommended us!!

<Content>Value for money in SF We decided to book the Chancellor based on the many good reviews we read on Tripadvisor and, we must say, we鈥檝e been guided very well as usual! We found the hotel very comfortable, we stayed at a 14th floor room, and we haven鈥檛 been disturbed from road noises, although Powell is very central and a cable car street. The room dimension was more than enough for our needs, very comfortable beds, with a wide choice of pillows on request. The temperature in the room was quite OK, and not hot as it happens in many hotels. Enough tv channels, the wi-fi connection worked perfectly. We liked the room design, the hotel in general is old style and charming, but with all of the comforts you may need. The bathroom was a bit small, and wc position a little bit cramped, but that did not represent too much of a problem. The personnel of the hotel was very kind and helpful when needed.In general, and if you consider the extremely central location, this hotel is value for money, and when we will be back to SF, for sure we will sleep there.

<Content>Its all in the details Well its been said many a time but the location of this hotel makes it a winner, and the price is fab but its all the extra touches that give it an addtional edge the pillow menu, sweetie jar in room, umbrella to use (we didn麓t need luckily!, free cookies, tea and coffee in lobby, they also laid on addtional breakfast items xmas day as the restaurant was closed, helpful friendly staff also contibute greatly to the winning package.If i had to be picky ( i work in the travel industry for a tour operator and part of my job is checking over properties before people arrive) the t.v reception was poor and the internet did not work in the room also i would have liked a fridge in the room. Our room was comfortable and warm with a great view of union square but i heard some guests were cold in the non south facing rooms. So i麓d suggest requesting one when you book. We had some kind of storage cupboard next to our room too which was noisy early in morning with staff banging aboutThese are minor things however and i would definately return and highly recommend to othersSan Francisco is a great city and this is a wonderful base

<Content>Pleasant Stay Old fashioned hospitality in a perfectly maintained hotel, at a great price, in a top notch area! The employees at this hotel are friendly, helpful and welcoming. Plus the hotel is attractive and clean. The manager should give himself a pat on the back as he obviously knows his job and does it well. Our room looked just like the web site. Starched white bedding against a nice green wall. Looking out our window we could see beautiful Union Square all decked out for Christmas. The elevator worked and was never overly busy. The free coffee in the lobby was better than the diner's next door...and always available (along with cookies and daily newspapers). The free internet in the lobby was helpful as were the people at the front desk who seemed glad to help you find restaurants etc. We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel's restaurant because so many tripadvisors raved about Sears which is next door...so wanted to try that...but saw a very intersting specials board when we got back, and wished we had eaten there instead. The hotel gave us free cable car tickets which we used to go to Fishermans Wharf where we took a boat to Alcatraz. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping. Saks 5th Ave is across the street and there's a huge Macy's, and too many other stores to name them all...lots of designer shops too. Union Square is sort of in the middle of the city, so every area is within walking distance. We walked to China town, the Embacardo, and Nob Hill.

<Content>loved the Chancellor My husband and I stayed at the Chancellor in December and had a wonderful experience! It was our honeymoon and they were nice enough to give us champage to celebrate! The location is fantastic and Union Square has so much to see and do. The beds were really comfortable and the service from all hotel staff was great. The only downside was one night we wanted to have a drink in the lounge but they had to close early. However there were plenty of other places close by so it was not a big deal. Overall this hotel is a great value and we will stay here again when we come back to San Francisco.

<Content>excellent location, pretty quiet, nice staff I've stayed at the Chancellor 2 or 3 times, and it has become the place I stay when in SFO. The attractions are in order of attactiveness: location, staff attitude, quietness. The location works for most of the Market/business dist area and I stay here for Moscone conferences as well. The place is consistently well staffed by people who notice you and ask if they can help in a proactive fasion. The rooms are a bit small, but that's what you get with an older property. And with an older property you also get more solid and quiet construction. I found most of the fixtures in the room of higher than average quality. Everything worked in my rooms there. There is no exercise equipment there, but I never care in SFO since it's a walkers paradise. While the property itself doesn't have some of the things I usually associate with an excellent rating, the location and value of this hotel combined with the consistent service level propels to this level.

<Content>Brilliant hotel! My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights over the Christmas period and had an excellent stay. We originally booked on the strength of the previous reviews and the very reasonable price we got (including parking), not to mention the great location a stone's throw from Union Square, the trolley stop and loads of shopping. We were not disappointed.The hotel itself is attractive, clean and recently renovated. Our room was on the small side, but this wasn't a problem - it was well appointed and had a very comfortable bed. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the little bar in the lobby was great to grab a quick night cap after a long day out! The free popcorn and freshly baked cookies were also a nice touch.All in all, a gem of a hotel and definitely recommended.

<Content>A little gem in busy Union Square Having decided on Union Square we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel for a well earned Christmas break. After reading the reviews of the Chancellor we booked it direct with them (cheaper than other so called discount travel sites). Upon arrival we were really pleased with the location and also the look and feel of the hotel. The staff were extremely helpful at check-in and also recommended local places to eat which we used and were very pleased. The room was very clean and being up on the 14th floor at the front corner we had an excellent view of not only Union Square but also the skyline beyond the bay. Bed was extremely comfortable, room had all the facilities we required and very relaxing. Room isn't the largest compared to some of the larger hotels but is more than adequate for what we needed given the amount of time actually spent in the room ie sleeping (did I mention the bed was very comfortable?)Staff at the hotel were all very friendly, knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions. Loved the individual feel of the hotel compared to chains we have stayed in previously eg the rubber duck in the bathroom was a lovely touch (especially as we had a Santa duck). Cookies and hot beverages in lobby were always plentiful no matter time of day. Overall would highly recommend this hotel. You can't go wrong for location, atmosphere, price, convenience, friendliness, cleanliness and beautiful old architecture. Would definitely stay here again should we return to San Francisco.

<Content>A wee gem What can I say that hasn't already been said by other reviewers? This hotel is a wee gem, an oasis in a desert of corporate anonymity. The hotel is quaint and quirky, with so many personal and unique surprises - thank you for the champagne, photo frames, rubber ducks (complete with Christmas hats!), popcorn, coffee and cookies. Everyone there was friendly, helpful and genuine - Alicia and Rex in the bar, Mao and the restaurant team, Susan at the Tour Desk, Rory and the front of house staff. Didn't meet Wes the manager but he's obviously doing a great job, setting the high standards that his team lives up to. The location is excellent, the rooms are great but it is the people who work there that make it so special. I would highly recomment this hotel to anyone who appreciates the personal touch and who wants an experience, not just somewhere to stay.I had the best holiday ever in San Francisco, it's a fantastic city. Thank you to all at The Chancellor. Happy New Year

<Content>Great Value on Union Square Stayed for 4 nights in two rooms over Christmas. Worked out really well for us. The bed was super comfy. The shower had plenty of hot water. The room was quiet for us. The room isn't large but has a couple of chairs and a desk. Free wireless internet too. San Francisco is one of those cities were if you are spending lots of time in your room, you just ain't doing the city right.Our 3rd floor room faced Powell street which is where the cable car runs and they start at 6:30am. This didn't bother us but we also don't sleep late. I'm guessing if you are a light sleeper who wants to sleep in you should ask for a room either higher up or not facing Powell. BTW, our 19 year old teenagers had no problem sleeping late! (Based on my other reviews I seem to be a little more sensitive to noise than others.)The front desk was very helpful in recommending places to eat.Only complaint (and the GM seems to read these comments) -- more chocolate chip cookies and fewer cinnamon raisin! Wow, that should be the complaint about all hotels right?We rented a car for a few days to go north along the coast. We self-parked which is no big hassle -- just around the block.We really liked the hotel's restaurant for breakfast. We ate there two days and service was fast and friendly. My coffee was refilled so quickly one day that I lost track of how much I drank and spent the day wired! The Sears Fine Food place next door gets lots of hype and a line of people standing out in the COLD for maybe 30 minutes to get in. It was good but not that good. The french toast at Sears is in my opinion better but the eggs were better at the hotel.We took BART from the airport and walked up Powell to the hotel. That was exactly 1 hour from the domestic terminal to the hotel's door.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed here just the one night here in November on the 9th Floor, had a good view of Union Sq. As mentioned previously this hotel is in a great location short walk to shops, trams, restaurants etc. The room and bathroom were perfect for us not that small. The only minor issue was the loud tv noise coming from the next room in the early hours of the morning, the noise appear to come though the locked door that separated the rooms, but was not a real problem, as we were very tired.

<Content>The Absolute Best! We stayed at The Chancellor Hotel on Union Square for our 30th wedding anniversary. It was fantastic. From the wonderful staff, to the great bedding, to the wonderful Lemon Drop martini! The GM, Wes Tyler, outdid himself. To help us celebrate, Wes gave us a room with a great view, a bottle of champagne with Chancellor glasses and a very nice picture frame to commemorate the occasion. I would highly recommend this hotel. The location is perfect. Just across from Union Square and very convenient to the trolley. Next time you visit SF, make sure you stay at The Chancellor Hotel!

<Content>Great place for Central SF Most travellers' reviews were good for this hotel, which is why we chose it. Our experience bears out the truth of these. Whilst the rooms may be considered small by US standards, they are perfectly adequate, well furnished, and very clean. There was more than enough space to move about easily, with comfortable chairs, as well as a desk. The free wifi was particularly appreciated. The huge walk-in closet for clothing and baggage, meant no clutter in the bedroom. The hotel staff were wonderful; very helpful and friendly. Full marks to them for customer service. We are horrendously light sleepers, and found the hum of a heating unit on a roof below (we were on the 6th floor) a bit disturbing as we like to sleep with the window open. Because of this we asked if we could change our room, and this was done very quickly and without any problem. A tip - if you want a really quiet room, ask for one at the back of the hotel above floor 10. We took breakfast every morning in the hotel's restaurant, Luques. Excellent food and service and great value. Try the scrambled egg with greens! We also liked their Protester breakfast - juice, coffee, fresh fruit cup and wholewheat toast - and there are other options.We would definitely stay here again. The only thing we would suggest as an improvement - and this goes for ALL US hotels - a means of boiling water in the rooms. Coffee and tea in the lobby is not terribly convenient if, like us, you need an early morning cuppa to get going!Andrew  Amanda

<Content>Location, location, location We visited San Francisco in mid November 2007. This was a fantastic place to stay in the city. Its location is perfect - right in the main shopping area and restaurants (can walk to Chinatown in 10-15 minutes) and is located right next to the tram line for easy reach to Fisherman's Wharf (for the ferry to Alcatraz), to the Castro and other SF tourist locations.The staff were really helpful with offering advice on places to eat, the breakfasts were really tasty and filling, and there is free internet located next to the main reception for booking the Alcatraz ferry in advance ! The rooms were clean (although small, but understandable for a city centre building) and beds really comfortable.For parking, we recommend you go for the valet option as its hassle free and your car is delivered to the outside of the hotel quickly. There are recommended parking lots nearby if you choose to self-park.Take a trip up the lift in Macy's on Union Square to the Cheese Factory restaurant for a great view of the surrounding area whilst you eat a great value meal with generous portions. We did this at night so got a great view of the Square all lit up.To summarise, we really liked this hotel as it was in a perfect location in the heart of the city and our stay was most enjoyable.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed here for 4 nights, great position, staff were very helpful especially OJ who gave us great advice about the area and always a lovely smile. Our room was the 2 room suite and we were very happy with it. The position on Powell st is great, a short stroll to Union Sq shopping, the Trolley cars to Fishermanns wharf are right outside the front door. Chinatown is an easy walk. I was travelling with my daughter(17 yrs) and we felt quite safe walking around in the evening. Lots of restaurants around the Chancellor. We caught a cab to little Italybut walked home thru Chinatown, which was great and fun for shopping.We asked about different restaurants and the staff were very helpful with recommendations and directions to some great places.If I return to SF I would definitely stay at the Chancellor Hotel again, it is not a big flash hotelif that is what you are looking for but had more of a homely feel which we really enjoyed. The cookies and fruit in the lobby is a nice touch.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel with 5* plus emphasis on Customer Service Having booked 11 months in advance with Wes Tyler direct based on reviews from Trip Advisor, I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed.The Hotel exceeded my expectations and quite frankly fail to understand how any one could complain about it. After all who wants to spend any time in your room whilst visiting SF. That said the rooms were sufficiently big enough with a huge walk in closet. A Bed and pillows to just curl up and sleep the night away.The bathrooms were big enough for the purpose.As this was a birthday surprise for my husband there was a bottle of wine and a souvenir gift awaiting us.Nice touch.As I said the personal touches- coffee and cookies in the lobby this was a nice treat to have each morning, popcorn in the bar in the evening,ice machines on each floor. Just little things that go a long way.The free internet access also was great.All of the staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable.I would recommend this hotel to anyone as a must, its so convenient right across from Union Square and the Cable Car stops right outside.I must also say the second part of our trip was a stay in Las Vegas at the Bellagio. Well quite frankly in my own opinion it was terrible! no customer service no personal touches and when asking for advice, unless you were going to tip them big style they couldn't help you.Wes thanks again to you and your stafff for making this charming hotel a gem in San Francisco.

<Content>Great boutique hotel We chose this hotel because of the reviews on this site and were not disappointed. We were given a room at the back of the hotel on the ninth floor (quieter). The room itself was on the small side but spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Location-wise this could not be better, right on Union Square with a Cable Car stop right outside. We bought the 3 day Muni passes ($18) and used them for travel throughout the city. You do not need a car! The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the breakfast staff who remembered us after the first morning. We also found the tour desk very helpful and really enjoyed the half day tour to Muir Woods and Sausilito. You can also book shuttle buses here to the Airport for around $15 per person. Nice touches included the free coffee and fruit in the Lobby plus the free internet access. Overall great value for money, excellent helpful staff, and the best location in S.F. What more could you want?

<Content>Why did we wait so long The first time I stayed at The Chancellor was in Dec. 1990 when I went Christmas shopping with three friends. We stayed at other hotels in and around Union Square during the past 17 years and they were OK. Living in the Central Valley we are frequent visitors to San Francisco.I came back to The Chancellor by a twist of fate. My mother, aunt and sister from New York wanted to visit San Francisco in September after attending my son's wedding. When we were talking about it, my aunt found a an index card my uncle (now deceased)had typed with information about The Chancellor. It had a hand written note on it that I liked it. On a fluke, we called the phone number on the card and sure enough the reservation clerk at The Chancellor answered in person. Same phone number 17 years later and a real live person!!! No recording!!! We booked a room for my husband and myself and suite for my mom, my aunt and my sister right next to us on the 15th floor. We had a wonderful time! The staff is top notch, so courteous and helpful. We love the extra touches of coffee, tea, cookies, fruit, newspapers 24-hours 7 days a week. Luques Restaurant has delicious food and superb Eggs Benedict ... Yum....During the Sept. trip I booked a suite for the Dec. 1 and 2, 2007 for myself and my three Christmas shopping friends. This time we got the suite on the 14th floor, which is in the back of the hotel and much quieter. We had a fantastic weekend and really got into the Christmas spirit!!! We did lots of shopping, eating, walking ....and laughing at Beach Blanket Babylon!! My friend wants to go back to SFO in January and already booked another hotel down the street. The desk clerk was rude and snappy 鈥?So, I wonder how our stay will be????I would rather stay at The Chancellor!!

<Content>Loved the Chancellor My husband and I stayed at the Chancellor from the 22nd to the 28th of Nov after reading many reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed, it was excellent. We had a room on the 2nd floor and despite initially being worried about noise, we found that it was fine and we slept brilliantly. The bed was very comfortable and the choice of pillows is great. All the staff were incredibly helpful and efficient, checking in and out really quickly and the restaurant staff remembered us each morning which was nice. Yes, some might say the room and the bathroom are small, but that is to be expected in a hotel of this type. I live in a new build house in Scotland and my bedroom at home is a lot smaller than the one at the Chancellor! Overall, I think this is a wonderful hotel and if you do your research properly you will not be disappointed. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I hope to return soon.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised I was a little dubious of this hotel because of its 'historic' tag, especially when approaching the hotel, since it is a rather old building. However, on entry my fears were allayed. The lobby was very nice, and the staff extremely friendly. The room was small, no doubt, but I don't think as painfully small as others have made out. The decor was quite nice, although the bathroom was very basic, but okay. Extremely clean though - so no need to worry about that.The location is fantastic, right on union square - the shopping district and a few bars and pubs there too.Some nice touchs too, like the complimentary cookies and fruit, as well as teas and coffees, which you can just pick up from the lobby on your way in/out. Free internet too on the lobby computer was very useful.Doubt you'll find a better deal for the area and price.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed in the Hotel durngthe 1st week of October. The room was on the 10th floor which was perfect. The hotel had a nice atmosphere. The staff were also very helpful, Susan in the gift shop was a character. The free tea/coffee and Cookies were great, and filled a big gap after walking around the steep streets.The Location was perfect, just about the best you could get for sight seeing and shopping.with the tram stop right outside the front door you couldnt beet it.Only small grip is that the Bar area was a little bit soleless, I think that they have decided not to compete with the numerous bars in the area.Would we come back= yesWould we recommend it= yes

<Content>Exactly what I wanted! My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel from August 7-8, 2007 (sorry for the delayed review, but I couldn't let this hotel go without my praise!) for his birthday. I bought tickets for two Giant's games and wanted to find the perfect little hotel for us to stay in. Location: I've been to San Fran many times before, and I love Union Square... so, this hotel couldn't be more perfectly located. Right on Union Square with a Cable Car stop right out the front door, with very easy access to public transportation (we bought a 3 day muni pass for $18 dollars, a great deal because PT in this city is very convenient), and LOADS of shopping nearby. Cost: I wanted to go on the cheaper side for hotel cost, since I had just spent a bunch on baseball tickets, so you really cant beat the price at the Chancellor. I did a ton of research on TripAdvisor and other hotel websites, and I knew that this was the place to stay. I got a great rate of around $100 per night, and I had origianlly only booked one night at first. After arriving at the hotel we realized that we had found a true gem and we immediately called the front desk to see if they could accomodate us for another night. The front desk was more than helpful in extending our stay and also made sure we wouldn't have to move our stuff into another room the next day. Simply flawless and friendly service. Room:I requested a room that was on a higher floor, newly renovated and facing union square. When we checked in we got a corner room on the ninth floor overlooking union square. Perfect. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was small but very functional. This is an older building so it has it's quirks and imperfections, but that all adds to the charm... so just keep that in mind. From reading past reviews, it seems that they are very good at accomodating every guest's requests... but I'm sure that there will be times when people's requests can't be met, but thats just how it goes. This hotel really goes out of its way to make their guests happy, so no one should let a little thing like tat ruin their stay. Service:Again, the service here is fantastic. The woman at the front desk was so nice and helpful, and make checking in a total breeze (we even arrived several hours before normal check in time, but this didn't seem to be a problem in our case). The bartender was also quite friendly and mixed some good drinks. Overall, you get great value for the money you pay. In a city like SF you can expect to pay tons of money at any hotel, so paying the rate you pay at the Chancellor, its almost like robbery! Simply cannot say enough good things about his hotel. So if you know what you are looking for: a smaller hotel, great location, charm and quirks, with great service, you shouldn't look any further than the Chancellor.

The cable cars can be accessed directly across from the hotel. We loved the coziness (and cleanliness) of our room, the positive atmosphere, and friendly staff. We are so glad we did not stay down in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Thank you to everyone at the Chancellor for making our stay great!

<Content>Three Star++ I've stayed at three 3 star hotels (and 1 4 star) near Union Square. The Chancellor is the best. Rooms are painfully small, but meticulously clean, well appointed, and supplied with many amenities not often found in 3 star hotels. The bed was the best hotel bed I've ever slept in. Choice of pillows: synthetic down, real down, buckwheat, and others. Down (?) comforter. Room noise is low for a hotel in this location. Location is ++++, right off Union Square and close to cable cars and BART. Highly recommended for travelers on a budget.

<Content>Best hotel for the price and location The staff were amazingly nice, the room small (but more than fine), and the location was great. I asked for and got a quiet room in the back of the hotel, and on check in was given discount coupons for breakfast in the hotel, for drinks in the lobby bar, and for Macy's. Lest that sound cheesy - it felt good, like taking some of the cost out of an expensive city. From the front door, I could see the Christmas tree in Union Square, and the decorated front of Macy's. I will not only stay there again, I will recommend to friends and family as the best hotel for the price in San Francisco.

<Content>A Business Stay I spent four nights at the Chancellor on a business trip (I am writing this review on my last night), and I have to say that, given the comfort, charm, friendliness, location and price of the hotel, the Chancellor is one of the best hotels I have ever experienced in San Francisco. No, the rooms are not like a Hyatt or Marriott, but that is a good thing in my mind. They are clean, with very comfortable new beds, and the room feels welcoming and charming rather than plastic. The staff are always accomodating and helpful, and the free WiFi saved me money since I did quite a bit of work from my room. I even got thank-you notes from housekeeping when I left them tips! The location is ideal for me, close to my home office, BART and Union Square shopping. There is access to a terrific fitness center around the corner (Club One) which even has a pool. And it is so very affordable. I want to thank everyone at the Chancellor for making this trip so enjoyable for me.

<Content>Can't beat location, service Stayed for 4 nights at the Chancellor Hotel this past Thanksgiving Holiday. Yes, it is an older, European style hotel but the wonderful and attentive staff made sure everything was in order and rooms were stocked daily (toiletries, recycle trash bags, nice fluffy pillows). Not to mention the coffee, tea and cookies/apples that were always available in the lobby. Best perks were the free internet (stayed at Embassy Suites by the airport first and internet wasn't free in rooms--for a business hotel?)..and of course the FREE valet/parking which is unheard of in Union Square!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, great service!!!! We booked this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor and had high hopes and expectations. We were not disappointed!!!!!!!! We received such a warm welcome from everyone as soon as we walked through the door it made us forget the 11 hour flight we had just been on. The staff on reception were friendly and helpful, the discounts for the bar, restaurant and Macy's were a very nice touch, we were also given a travel pass that previous guests had bought but had left with 3 days still left on it, this was a pleasant surprise and saved us some money and helped us find our way around San Francisco. Our room was clean and modern and there was nothing wrong with the colour and carpets as a previous reviewer has stated!!!! Yes the rooms weren't huge but that wasn't a surprise and our room was more than sufficient and who goes away and spends most of their time in their room??????? We couldn't fault the food at breakfast and it was always nice to be greated with a smile and a happy hello. The location was spot on, right in the heart of Union Square and close to transport links to the rest of the city. All of this helped make a great holiday but there was one thing that changed this and made it a fantastic holiday and it was Susan on the Tour Desk!!! We booked trips, the shuttle to the airport and a car through Susan, she was friendly and helpful and I don't think there was a day that we didn't ask her at least one question and she never let us down with the answer, she was there 12 hours a day and she was there all 8 days we were, does she ever have a day off??????Overall the Chancellor Hotel is a great hotel in a great location and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!!!!!

<Content>good hotel, nice lokation and very friendly personell!! We stayed at the chancellor at the end of our roundtrip through california, arizona and utah. It was a really nice hotel with very friendly personel, who where ready to answer all of our questions at any time and gave us great tips on where to go and eat. Nice clean room. The lokation is great, central in the city on union square, from were you can get almost everywhere. The only thing we regret is the poor shuttle service, which we were shown at when we asked tot call for a cab to the airport. We were cramped in to small fan with 7!! persons, when we complained the driver just ignored us and said that it was'nt his responsibility. This was the only negative thing we experienced at our stay.I would like to recommend this hotel very much.......but don't use the shuttle service!

<Content>Always a pleasure I've stayed at the Chancellor everytime I visit San Francisco - first in 1999 and around 7 times since, the last time being Nov 2007. I've found the hotel, facilities and staff consistently very good and will definitely return.Location - right on Union Square and therefore excellent location for shopping, plenty of restaurant choice, Chinatown, Cable Car runs right past the hotel down to the wharf. Some may find rooms at the front a little noisy however its never bothered me and this stuff is all part of staying right in the heart of the cityRooms - SFO hotel room sizes are similar to NY ie you dont get a huge room but I've always found the room size to be good and more than sufficient for my requirements. As one recent reviewer mentioned, the bathroom is on the small side but its all works and is clean with plenty of hot water for showering and soaking plus the nice little touch of the rubber duck or the tub - can I buy these?Staff - I've always found them welcoming, friendly and efficient. They really seem to like working here - always a good sign for me.General - An older hotel and some (those who may like ultra-modern hotels) may regard the Chancellor a little scuffed around the edges but for me that just adds to its character. Add this to very reasonable cost, great location and consistently good staff and you have yourself a little gem. Highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Value but thin walls The Chancellor actually gets 5 on service/value  2.5 on ambience. I got $100/night via Expedia-great rate for downtown SF on Union Square for an older but upgraded facility that had free and reliable wireless internet, free access to a health club 1 block away, free paper, coffee, cookies, immaculate,  excellent customer service. Comfortable bed but room small, dark, somewhat depressing, mournful-green decor. Real problem-thin walls. In my first room, my neighbor came in at 3 AM, loud conversation, easily heard, awful night. Not the hotel鈥檚 fault though they were more than gracious in getting me a room on the top floor, away from cable car noise,  with much better light. Also retrieved a couple of things I forgot in the course of the move. Could still hear conversation next door but not at all hours of night, an improvement. Bottom line-excellent value if you are a deep sleeper.

<Content>Exceeded our Expectations We chose the Chancellor based on other Trip Advisor reviews. It exceeded our expectations for three-star hotels in every way. We've stayed in other hotels in the same Union Square neighborhood before but think this is certainly the best value. We were able to get a parking package which is critical for this area of San Francisco -- parking rates can be as high as $38 a day. The parking lot was just 1/2 block away which was another nice change from the other neighborhood hotels we've stayed in. The room was a little small, but obviously recently remodeled and even had a view. The bed was wonderful and the bathroom was small but sparkling clean (yes, it had a tub). One caveat: the hotel is on a boiler system, so there's no heat available until late at night. The hotel gave us a portable radiator that kept us warm until the building heat kicked on. The lobby has free coffee, newspapers and cookies. We enjoyed the breakfast at the small restaurant, Lucques. The staff was friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay here again.

<Content>A great value in San Francisco We stayed at the Chancellor hotel for three nights in August of 2007, and have nothing to complain about. The location was great, the rooms were very nice for the price paid, and the staff was attentive to our needs. The hotel is on the cable car line and close to many restaurants. When we visit San Francisco next time, we will definitely stay here!

<Content>Don't Stay Here! We booked a recently renovated room. What we received was a room with a worn, dirty bedspread, dirty bathroom floor and tub, and soiled furniture. The bed was so brick hard and uncomfortable that we were unable to get any sleep. We asked for the newly renovated room that we booked or a suite, and were told that none was available. The desk clerk did have a cleaner worn bedspread and better linen put on the bed, but the bathroom floor and tub still looked dirty and worn. The bathroom was so small that you could barely sit on the toilet without bumping into the sink. The remote didn't work for the TV, but it didn't matter because it was an old model with bad reception. Since it was my birthday, they did give us a nice bottle of wine. Also, they offered to comp our room or let us find another hotel. We chose the compensation since it was too late to find another hotel, but it was a miserable night on a brick hard bed. The room picture on the internet must have been taken a long time ago, because it did not reflect the actual room.

<Content>Great hotel in superb location! Having read all the Tripadvisor reviews for the Chancellor Hotel, my wife and I booked 4 nights for our first ever stay in San Francisco. Having read many good things and being particularly impressed with General manager Wes Tyler's responses on this site, I am pleased to say that the hotel lived up to all our expectations. We had a friendly welcome upon check-in by Steve, the guy who dealt with us and the process was quick and very efficient. He also gave us a map and told us to come to reception with any queries. I had made a request to Kevin Vossen prior to travel for one of their reburbished rooms on a high floor with a good view of Union Square and they were able to fulfil this request so thanks very much Kevin!! Brilliant view of Union Square day and night and the windows did a great job of blocking the noise out. The room was nicely decorated and clean. It was more than big enough for our needs and the bed was very comfy! Bathroom was clean and maybe a little small for some but we were happy with it. Having complimentary coffee and tea available (along with the cookies) is a really great idea and gives the guests so much freedom and free use of their computer for internet access is an added bonus. One of the best things about the hotel must be it's location to Union Square, the San Francisco centre and everything else. It's fantastic! We could spend all day sight seeing and then spend the evening shopping with it being so easily accessible! Union Square is also close to all the main transportation routes so is ideal as a base. We were originally going to stay on Fisherman's Wharf but upon visiting it are very glad that we didn't. Too touristy for our liking and a bit further out. Our recommendation is stay around the Union Square area, you won't regret it! So, to get back to it, we throughly enjoyed our trip to San Francisco and our stay at the Chancellor Hotel. San Francisco as a city is really great and our stay was made all the more better with us staying at the Chancellor Hotel. Well done Wes and co. keep up the good work! We may not be heading back to SF for a while yet but we hope that when we next return, the hotel will still be keeping up it's high standards and we'll be staying there once again! One last thing! A nice and thoughtful touch is to have an umbrella in the room closet for us to use - came in handy on our last full day when it absolutely rained all day!!!

<Content>The perfect City Hotel My Family stayed in the Chancellor Hotel earlier this year for a family wedding being held in San Francisco. Between us we had roughly fifteen rooms in the hotel. The staff could not have been more accomodating to our party. As most reviewers have said the rooms are on the small side but this is to be expected for a city hotel and the location more than makes up for this.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Franciso as I don't think you'll find a better hotel for this price. I look forward to returning to the Chancellor in the near future.

<Content>Loved the Chancellor We recently visited San Francisco for our first of many trips and were very pleased to see the cleanliness of the City. We booked a small boutique hotel based upon reviews that we had read on Trip Advisor. We knew going in that the hotel would be an older hotel and the rooms not large. We also knew the hotel would be classy but not offer every amenity like pool and spa on site and shops. We chose this hotel for its location on the Powell cable car line and easy walking access to Union square and the available shopping. We had also heard many positive reviews about the staff and the General Manager, Wes Tyler.Check in was prompt and efficient as promised. No difficulty finding the rooms or getting around the small hotel. The room was small and there were unusual quirks that went along with the hotel鈥檚 age such as threshold steps going into the bathroom (can make an interesting trip to the loo in the middle of the night), short shower head/spray and no air conditioning but the positives out way the negatives many times over. The room had very high ceilings, very quiet floor, could not hear the neighbours or elevators but could hear an annoying metal sound coming up from Powell Street that I was not familiar with and it had me baffled only to find out it was the doormen of the hotels in the area hailing cabs with a whistle. This ended mid evening and did not keep us awake. It must be a California tradition to cover the hotel beds with many pillows. It was quite nice. The bed was very comfortable. We were greeted in our room with a large jar of tasty candies and a delicious bottle of California wine, corkscrew, wine glasses and a birthday card because it was my husband鈥檚 birthday. Large bars on glycerine soap in the bathroom were appreciated along with a little yellow surprise staring at us on the shelf (find out for yourself what it is). That shows the hotel鈥檚 sense of humour as well as a nice personal touch. We bought the Muni pass for 3 days for $18.00 each that gave us unlimited travel throughout the City including cable cars, streetcars and buses that allowed us to get around San Francisco extremely easily without having to rent a car. We purchased the pass in the lobby at the Chancellor hotel.Upon recommendation from the front desk at check-in, we went to the top floor of Macy鈥檚 for lunch at the Cheesecake Factory and had a great lunch. By nighttime we were exhausted due to traveling time and we decided to just order sandwiches from the hotel restaurant and we brought them to our room. This was very convenient. The food was good and reasonable. Also in the lobby were delicious cookies, apples, teas and coffee available to all guests free of charge 24 hours a day. Very nice touch!Our stay was made very enjoyable due to the helpful front staff in particular, Rory, a dignified and attentive person who fulfilled our every whim and offered helpful information and directions. He was very pleasant to talk with. Wes the General Manager met us one night in the bar and offered us additional directions for the remainder of our trip to California and even provided maps and shortcuts and told us about the new wine region of Paso Robles. Thank you Wes for arranging the excellent weather as requested. The friendly bartender could carry on a pleasant conversation as well as keep you abreast of the sports scores (too bad Boston won). Also, having free internet in the lobby made it easy to communicate with family members at home. The most favourable thing about this hotel can be summed up in three words. Location, location and location. Good value for the money and looking forward to our next stay at the Chancellor Hotel.

<Content>Experience the charm! My husband and I just returned from San Francisco where we spent 4 nights at the Chancellor Hotel on Union Square. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and my husband's 60th birthday by taking this trip. We chose the Chancellor Hotel based on reviews from TripAdvisor and we couldn't be more pleased with the choice. Kevin Vossen, the Reservations Supervisor, not only helped tremendously with providing accomodations due to some health-related issues involving my husband, but also made us welcome with celebration gifts. Although we had read reviews that the rooms were small, we found the space more than adequate (and we are not small people). The room was beautifully decorated, very clean, had the coziest bed with great pillows, and was overall...charming. All of the staff we met were helpful, courteous and pleasant. We received assistance with our laptop, were given detailed instructions for navigating the city, got a great recommendation for dinner in Chinatown, and got smiles with each request! This is a lovely, period hotel with the best location in the heart of the city! Easy access to great shopping, fine dining, and the cable cars! We highly recommend the Chancellor Hotel as it has warmth and charm and offers great value for the price!

<Content>Location couldnt be better We stayed ay the Chancellor for 3 nights this week. We loved the historic charm of the hotel. Our room was very clean, had a HUGE walk in closet. The bathroom was small but it was fine. The bed was SO comfortable. We didnt take advantage of the pillow menu but it had some cool options. The hotel is right across from a cable car stop which was great. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and if you like to shop youre in heaven. We walked to Chinatown and down to North Beach. For breakfast we went right next door to Sears. I went here when I was about 6 and it looks the same. I highly recommend the oatmeal. Yes, the oatmeal. It was amazing. The husband had the famous pancakes but I honestly thought the waffle was much better. OK, back to the Chancellor. The staff at the desk was helpful with directions and gave us printed directions and a map to Golden Gate park. The park is out of the way but worth the visit. We spent the morning at the Japanese Tea garden and then walked to Haight Ashbury (overrated) The only bad thing I can say about the Chancellor was the walls were very thin. We heard the phone conversations and TV programs from the room next door. News, weather forecast, traffic, and stock woes all before 8am. Overall the location, price and service was great, the room was comfortable but not luxurious. I wouldnt recommend this hotel to elderly travelers because the walls of the tub are very high to step in and out of.

<Content>Fantastic! My husband and I travel to San Francisco 2 or 3 times a year, and like to try out a new hotel each time. We prefer the Union Square area, but always face a conundrum: The smaller, renovated hotels are convenient, but often a bit rough around the edges. Of all the area hotels we've stayed in, the Chancellor Hotel comes closest to getting everything right. For starters, the location really is ideal. It's between Borders Books and the venerable Sears Fine Food, just steps off Union Square. The attractive lobby is open and airy, and the employees are impeccably helpful and polite. Our room, on an upper floor, was very tastefully decorated, with high-end bedding and contemporary appointments. The bathroom was squeaky clean, with modern fixtures and period details. Yes, the room was a bit on the small side, and the soundproofing could have been better. But those are the realities of an older hotel. It was ideal for us. I can definitely count our stay at the Chancellor Hotel as one of the best we've enjoyed in many years of travel to the City.

<Content>Loved it! Just returned from our 4th stay at the Chancellor. We wouldn't stay anywhere else. The staff are eager to help in any way possible and the location can't be beat. The rooms are small, but very clean. We ate breakfast in the restaurant 1 morning and enjoyed it very much. It is apparent that the General Manager cares, he was working the front desk at check out, not hidden in some office like General Managers of other hotels we have stayed in. Our only regret is that we will not be able to return until next January. We suggestg eating at Fior d'Italia if you are in the mood for Italian food. We love the Veal Parmigana.

<Content>Great location, nice friendly staff We tried for the Packing Package when we booked online but it was not being offered. When we called the hotel directly and mentioned we had stayed there before they were very nice and gave us the package. They also try very hard to give you a quiet room if you request it. It's an older hotel and the rooms are clean and average size for the Union Square neighborhood. If you like being in the heart of it, the location is great and in a very safe area. The staff is friendly. The parking is either valet (an additional cost) or park yourself at a garage around the corner. We chose the park yourself and the advantage of retrieving your car quickly is a plus in our book. There are times in the past at other hotels that we have waited up to an half hour for our car. We would definitely stay there again.

We enjoyed the above-par service, the clean and cozy room (yes, a little tight but workable), the coffee and cookies in the lobby 24/7, and cozy bar where we could enjoy a cocktail in a quiet atmosphere -- all at a very reasonable price. Best of all, the hotel is totally non smoking!! Location is perfect, right near Union Square and in front of a cable car stop, within walking distance of many fine resturaunts and shopping areas. Kudos to the Chancellor for making our stay in San Francisco most enjoyable!

<Content>Fantastic stay What was great about this hotel apart from the great rates and superb location, were the little touches that made my stay perfect. This was the first long haul holiday with my wife and 10 month old daughter. The hotel provided on request a decent cot and a fridge at no additional cost. Upon checking in I was issued with 4 free travel tickets for the trams, which were readily used. The bed was very comfortable and the room clean and pleasant to stay in, this was important as my daughter being so young needed to be in bed by 8.00. The rooms were not the largest I have stayed in, but were cosy. The restaurant was fine (decent breakfast) as was the bar, but being with child we could not utilize to their full potential. The free coffee or tea and complimentary cookies were a nice touch.The staff were helpful and courteous although having all that i needed I never needed press them for anything. Overall everything I needed with no effort . Great hotel.

<Content>location, location, location only the beginning, beginning, beginning General Manager Wes Tyler recently referred to the Chancellor as a 鈥渟imple hotel in a great location.鈥?Me thinks Wes is too modest. Certainly the Chancellor enjoys an unbeatable 鈥淔ive Star鈥?location on Union Square and the property itself is more of a three star hotel, longer on historic charm (the wide moldings, original bathtubs, wrought iron banisters) than luxury.But simple? There is nothing simple about assembling a staff who take such obvious pride in their work as evidenced by keeping the place spotless and extending themselves beyond the call of duty to provide helpful suggestions about nightlife, restaurants, and transportation. There is nothing simple about the extra touches that make a stay here enjoyable鈥攆resh coffee and cookies 24/7, 鈥渇our star鈥?sized towels, pillows and linens in a three star hotel, free wifi in the rooms, and in-room umbrellas in case of rain, or the option of a free newspaper In the morning from a menu including the SF Chronicle, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal or the NY Times. There is nothing simple about the manager asking guests their preferences and selecting a room suited to individual tastes. Or about the bowl of hard candy, the welcome bottle of local wine, or the rubber ducky in the bath. These touches require a certain obsession with being the best hotel possible, within the limits of the hotels architecture and age. This commitment to excellence, perhaps commonplace when the Chancellor was built, has become a rarity in our time. The hotel is old but is by no means rundown. The paint our room was fresh and the carpet was new. Furniture has been updated.But it is not the Marriott or Ritz Carlton.As Wes frequently writes...do not stay here if you are looking for a luxury hotel. Rooms here are adequately sized but not spacious. Our room featured a queen bed, writing desk, small end table flank. The walk-in closet was huge. Since we were able to place all of our bags in the closet, we had more useable space in the room itself. Bathrooms are charming but not very large. There is no air conditioning. Do stay here if you are looking for lots of value for not much money...an immaculate room....and welcoming staff....and lots of little touches..... The Chancellor is rated by TA readers as one of the best value hotels around. Given the prices for other hotels in the heart of SF, we wholeheartedly agree. We spent more for dinner for two than for our room! Wes, thanks to you and your staff for helping to make our trip special and for a reminder of the real difference a commitment to excellence can make.

<Content>great location We stayed here for two nights a few weeks ago. The location is great, right on Union Square. A bit of noise from the trams going past, but the sound of the bells being rung is part of SF. The room was fine, really liked the goose-down pillows and soft duvets. Didn鈥檛 try out the pillow menu, but a great idea as a pillow can make or break a good night鈥檚 sleep. The bathroom was okay, a bit in need of freshening up though. Scratches on the bath etc. overall a good stay, but nothing spectacular as I was expecting when I saw that it was rated 3rd in SF. I can鈥檛 comment on the service or food as we ate out all the time, but they were quite happy for us to check out at 6am due to a tour pick-up. Try the diner up the street. Real chrome and 50s kitsch. overall a nice hotel in a good location.

<Content>Superb Amazing hotel in a great location.This hotel should be 4 or 5 stars for the service and the quality of the room, and proves how flawed the whole star system can be as I have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels which have been much worse than this one.Firstly the location is second to none. You are staying right on union square in prime central location. You are staying right next to all the most expensive hotels, and the most expensive shops and restaurants.To get there from the airport I would advise taking one of the shuttle buses which will cost only $14 plus tip, much cheaper than a taxi.The service throughout the hotel was excellent. The room was a good size, and it was located in a quiet area as I requested, although I thought the whole hotel was quiet.The hotel has wi-fi throughout, and if you do not have a computer you can check your emails on the computer in the lobby for free! The room had a nice size bathroom, which a good shower/bath. There is a fan in the room, which I preferred compared to the air-conditioning systems found in most hotels which always give me a sore throat.There is also a television and a clock which can play your mp3 player through its speakers.As for San Francisco it is very nice. Would definitely advise booking Alcatraz as soon as you get there as it is always booked up during peak season for at least a day, so if you are only staying a couple of days book it before you go there, and if you are staying a week or so, then do it as soon as you get there.The tour bus, located in Fishman's Wharf is a good way of seeing the city (and is close to the place for buying Alcatraz tickets) so I would advise seeing Fisherman's Wharf, buying your Alcatraz tickets and doing some of the tours on the first day so that you have a good orientation on the city.Enjoy,

<Content>Great location, funky room, good price Having spent ages researching hotels and b and b's in San Fran, I ended up with the Chancellor based on trip advisor ratings and the candid photo's - these were ten times better than the home page pictures on the current hotel owned website which really put me off initially - update your site guys! You need to do the rooms justice! From the site I thought the more basic rooms would look like the homepage pics but they don't which is a good thing!Couldn't really fault our stay - loved the room - must have been done up recently (again, does your website make this clear Chancellor Hotel?) in a very funky but restrained way. Felt like a retro, botique style and not stiff, prim or chintzy like so many overpriced supposedly up market places. Bed was fab - good mattress, choice of pillows. We overlooked union square but despite that, not too noisy (12th floor)Bathroom could be a little too 'retro' for some people - think the fittings are the same as before renovation and looked a little old but spotlessly clean so who cares? If you are fussy about your bathroom this could be an issue but all we want is enough space and a decent shower and for it to be clean to it ticked all our boxes there. No fridge in room which seemed odd at first but didn't really miss it and you can get ice down the corridor. Breakfast room service was OK but never been over impressed anywhere so can't fault the effort. Staff were great accross the board - friendly and helpful at desk and in the bar, prompt room service. Gave the place a really pleasant atmosphere. I asked for a room that I saw on the trip advisor site and got it which i hadn't expected and it was my girlfriends birthday - they supplied a card and bottle of good, red wine which was a really nice touch. Thanks Chancellor!Location is very convenient. We weren't that keen on Union Sqaure area itself but if you want to shop - this is the place to be. Best things going for location are the cable car right outside to take you to more interesting areas such as North Beach, Russian Hill etc. Unless you are taking a boat trip, advise staying well clear of Fisherman's Wharf (although sea lions are great fun!) as its tacky, packed and doesn't do San Fran justice - much better to hang out in funky neighbourhoods or go to Golden Gate state park. Ferry to Sansaulito highly recommended - pretty little town with great eating options over the bay. China town, city lights bookstore, north beach cafes and bars all an easy walk away - these were our favourite places to hang out and wander and Chancellor was the perfect place to come back and chill after walking around all day. We would go back and will recommend to anyone for a good value, relaxing stay in a great hotel.

<Content>The Chancellor - A great little hotel Travelling with my husband, twin 18 year old boys and 89 year old mom, we found the Chancellor was just right for all ages. The rooms were surprisingly quiet considering the hotel is in the heart of all the action in the Union Square Area. It is an older hotel so the rooms are not huge but big enough. The hotel has the charm that comes with an older hotel.The room was nice and dark at night without a lot of light coming in from the hallway. If you like to be in the heart of things when you travel you cannot beat the location. The boys loved being so close to the Cheesecake Factory at Macy's. Although the hotel does not have its own gym, guests are give a pass to what my boys described as an excellent gym nearby.  The boys and my mom really enjoyed evening snacks of cookies, popcorn and coffee, available for free in the lobby. The lobby was a great place to gather in the evening because of the nice casual atmosphere at the hotel. It has a staff that give great service just the right amount - genuinely friendly and helpful. One of them gave us great advice for places to dine that only a local would know. The Chancellor is very well-priced, well-located and well done! I would definitely stay there again and again. -Wendy .

The rooms, although smaller than the usual American standard, were perfectly adequate and comfortable. The staff were extremely helpful and the extras provided made our stay at The Chancellor very memorable. The coffee  cookies, on tap 24/7, is a great boost, along with the apples and popcorn. I would certainly recommend this hotel, in fact I have been doing so back at work and to my friends. If I go back to San Francisco I will certainly be staying at The Chancellor.

<Content>Europoean Style Hotel I have used Tripadvisor extensively for the past few years. I decided to give the Chancellor Hotel a try due to it's reviews. Hotels as a whole are expensive in San Francisco  this one seemed to be a bit more moderately priced. My expectations were not high but my hopes were. As we entered the lobby my heart sank as it is drab, dreary  dull! We continued up to our room in one of the tiny elevators. Following the narrow hallway to our room, it made me think of historical hotels we've stayed in in NYC  Europe. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered our room! Although the room was very small (no room for a roll away), it was tastefully decorated. It's bedding was excellent. It had 4 pillows (you can request a variety of options), a fiberfill mattress topper, as well as 2 duvets with excellent linens. The carpet was newish with a tasteful plaid. The windows had sheers plus black out drapes which allowed sleeping in. Ours looked out on Powell  since we were on the third floor, when the window was open, it was very noisy. However, when closed it was very quiet  did not cause us any problem. ( They should do commercials for the effectiveness of their windows.) You would not be able to sleep with it open due to the noise, however. The hotel is not air conditioned but a ceiling fan was very efficient  served our needs. The bathroom is so tiny two people can't be in it at the same time, unless one wants to stand in the bathtub. However, it has a nice makeup mirror, good shower head,  plenty of lighting. In the room we appreciated  took advantage of the suitcase stands  safe  ice machine down the hall. In the lobby we enjoyed the gratis coffee, cookies, apples  newspapers provided. All the staff we met were pleasant  accommodating. We were very impressed with Susan who books tours, etc, as she seems to work at least 12 hour days in little more than a closet. Other than the lifeless lobby, the hotel is lovely.

<Content>Best Place I have Stayed We stayed in the Chancellor for a week in July this year and loved every minute!The rooms were lovely, clean, well designed and decorated and the wine and picture frame were a fabulous touch.We ate breakfast in the hotel twice and I can well recommend the chocolate chip pancakes!My husband loved the coffee, cookies and popcorn on offer in reception and used these each day!The best thing about the Chancellor though has to be the staff, they were all polite and helpful making you feel like you were the only guest they had to look after, it really made our holiday!

<Content>Chancellor hotel a great stay We booked our stay last week at the Chancellor hotel after reading many of the good reviews right here on Tripadvisor.Well, I am happy to say now that our 1 week stay is over, the hotel certainly lived up to its billing. The staff was courtious and helpful any time we needed anything. Wes was kind enough to give us a top floor front location along with Sparkling wine with glasses for our 25 anniversary which we were celebrating early. Had many good laughs and conversation with Rex, the bartender to wind up several of our nights. All in all I would highly recommennd this hotel to anyone. Do keep in mind that it is a boutique hotel. Which basically means the hotel rooms are on the small side, but that was to be expected. They are clean and well appointed. If anyone is having doubts about this hotel, please put them to rest and book your stay in this fine hotel.

<Content>Great location Arrived at half past three in the afternoon to be told that the room was not ready, was not too put out as we had only came from Dallas, would not have been to happy if we had just gotten off a transatlantic flight. However soon forgot about the delay when we saw the room 1103. It was lovely with a great view of Union Square. Loads of room, great bathroom and huge closet. Lifts were great never had to wait long for them. Staff that we did speak to were pleasant and Susan at the tour desk was a great help. This hotel is brilliantly situated for everything and we will be rebooking when we return to San Francisco.

<Content>Excellent value Being on our honeymoon and having just left the Bellagio in Vegas and heading for a stay in the Chancellor in San Fran we were slighly anxious to say the least. We were anxious for nothing and did not need worry. On arrival we had a complimentary bottle of sparking wine and a lovely photo frame waiting in our room. Lovely touch. The room was a fine size, clean with a very comfortable bed. A great pillow menu available if thats your thing!! A nice touch also was the tasty sweet jar in each room which was filled each morning. If you like cookies and coffee well then this hotel is your paridise. They have complimentary coffee, tea and cookies available all day in the lobby. The only but..... is that they put the cookies up by the reception desk later in the evening and you feel guilty taking them!!! Well probably only because we were we savages......Should be ok for most people.The staff were very friendly, the location was prefect, tram outside your door, and good value shuttle service to airport available. To sum it up and given the price you pay for this hotel you could not ask for better value. I would consider myself being very critical of service and value for money but COULD NOT FAULT THIS HOTEL. Thumps Up for the Chancellor. Brendan Walshe  Amanda O'Shea, Cork, Ireland

<Content>Good hotel, great location - poor breakfast. As the last reviewer said we also booked this hotel on the recommendation of many on TripAdvisor. We haven't been disappointed.The location is superb, especially given the price. The cable car is right outside the door along with all the shops you could possible ever want. I've found the hotel staff friendly too and the wi-fi connection (which I'm using now) is a nice bonus (when it is working).The only real downside is the poor restaurant facilities. They stop serving at 2.30pm and the bar stops at 9.30pm. Didn't find the staff in the restaurant too good either.Highly recommended.

<Content>Loved it! As an Australian from quiet Adelaide who had not been to the USA before, I didn't know quite what to expect. I booked this hotel on the recommendation of other Trip Advisors.The Chancellor Hotel, was in a great location, had friendly staff and went out of their way to assist in all of our requests. We had three rooms booked as there were six in our group. All three rooms, while small and old, were clean and had everything we required. The free apples, cookies, coffee and internet access were a nice touch. Their tour desk was helpful and booked several things for us quickly and efficiently - they sell stamps and postcards (get the postcards down the street for 1/2 the price) they even posted our postcards for us.For the price, service and location, I would definitely recommend the Chancellor. While there are beggars on the street nearby, they did not hassle us and I felt safe at all times, even late at night. The street is busy, full of people, cheapish eateries and the cable car stop is directly outside the front door of the hotel. The hotel staff recommended a great Italian restuarant, so it's worth asking their advice on where to eat. The shopping in the area is great, with big brands and a huge Westfield about 5 minutes down the street.It's a hotel where they take an interest in their guests. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>Great location, fantastic staff - the best place to stay in san fran. We rang ahead before we arrived to check we could have a courier package delivered to the hotel, and let slip that the package was our weding photos and we were on our honeymoon. The staff put us in the best room on the top floor (15th) and we arrived to find a bottle of champagne and card congratulating us on our wedding. What a great welcome!The trams run right outside so its really easy to get around. Much less touristy around Union Square than down Fisherman's Wharf area. Stay here - its great.

<Content>good location We were recommended this hotel by travel agent as opposed to staying at Fisherman's Wharf. I am glad we took their advice, we did not rate Fisherman's Wharf. Hotel rooms were small but very comfortable, had been recently refurbished so everything was very clean and fresh. Location was excellent, minutes from Union Square and on the cable car route, close to theatres and shops and within walking distance of China Town. Rory was a particular helpful member of staff. Some members of staff I found not exactly unfriendly but not very approachable. Would recommend this hotel.

Free sweets in your room (yum), free cookies at reception, and free popcorn. The world famous pancakes next door are over rated, so don't bother (especially when the Q is huge at the weekend!).

<Content>The maneger was a jerk ! At the time we reserved the roomsin July,2007, we had requested an early check in, if possible. I had reserved 3 rooms for 5 nights for three of my employees,my wife and myself. Upon arrival at 1:30 two of the rooms were not ready . Despite travelling all day we took the opportunity to sightsee for a couple of hours. The check in desk assured me that they would be ready no later than 3:00. When we returned at 3:30,the rooms were still not ready but we were assured that they would be ready shortly. So we waited and waited. At 4:30 the second room was ready and the third room was ready at 4:55. I thought the wait was excessive and I asked to speak to the manager to register my concerns. The general manager promptly arrived and told me he was sorry for the wait. However, when I tried to get a word in during the 2+ minute conversation(?) the guy kept talking and talking, never letting me express my complaint. Finally, fed up with this, I held up both hand and said fine, I'll go to my room. Sensing my irritation,he offered to buy me a beer! A BEER ! So much for customer relations . At the Chancellor Hotel it seems to stop at saying I'm sorry. The staff especially Harris and Rory were excellent. GRF

<Content>Good for the Price We recently spent two nights at the Chancellor in September, 2007. I felt the hotel represented itself very well on their website. It鈥檚 an historic hotel and has been recently renovated. It has no air conditioning. They mentioned that on the site, but because the windows needed to be left open at night for comfort, it meant the noise from the street below was quite loud. The cable car runs right in front of the hotel and they run until 12:30 a.m. That means the ringing of their bells goes on well into the night. We bought a floor fan from the pharmacy next door and all was well. The rooms (and the hallways) are very small, but were immaculately clean. The beds were comfortable and they offered a whole menu of different types of pillows and sound machines, to help make you comfortable. We were on Eastern Standard Time, which meant we were up long before the restaurant opened in the morning, but they have a little coffee bar in the lobby that is available 24/7 which was a nice touch. Ditto, the fresh-baked cookies!If you like being at the heart of things downtown, it was a nice place to be.

<Content>Just a Fantastic Hotel Booked up for 3 nights at the Chancellor for the penultimate leg of our honeymoon fly drive. And like most people we booked up on the strength of Trip advisor, loving the fact that the almost legendary Wes Tyler takes time to answer his critics and tell it like it is!Location is superb - slap bang in the middle of town just off Union Square. People have spoken about the noise - it was no louder than any other major city - and if you want quiet go to country retreat: We came to San Francisco for the bustle! Having said that we had no bother sleeping - quite the opposite. The beds are superb and the refurbed rooms very comfy.You want shopping? Then Union Sq is on your doorstop and Market St just 5 mins away. The trams pass outside the front door and will take you to Fishermans Wharf where you can bike the Golden Gate. A host of restaurants and bars all within 2 mins walking distance - you have to try the cheesecake factory on the top floor of Macy's - leave some room for desert!The service here is brilliant - you can happily use the internet for nowt and even print off what you need too. The front desk staff were both welcoming and helpful. The bar was well stocked and the barman friendly but my only possibly gripe would be to keep it open longer! I tried the breakfast at the restaurant and it was quality. All in all Mr Wes I would say don't change anything. This place has real charm, character and you cannot fault the service or location. As for the price? Bargain - cheapest hotel of our honeymoon and the one we enjoyed the most. If you are planning to stay in San Francisco then you must give this place a try!

<Content>Good, but not as good as I expected from reviews on here I'll say we were disappointed, not because the hotel was bad, but because from reading the reviews we thought it was going to be the best hotel of our trip and it wasn't. We expected the friendliest staff in a charming little hotel with lovely food. But to us, it just seemed like another decent hotel. Staff were helpful enough but nothing exceptional. Breakfast was far from being the best. And the hotel DOES look like it needs updating, especially the carpets which are worn out indeed.However, the room we were in was quiet (not paper thin walls at all) and clean, which is the main thing. The duck was a nice touch, but we also had one from the hotel we stayed in the night before so weren't impressed by that either. But to be honest that's not what I go to hotels for, as long as the staff is decent and the room is clean it's good enough. Also, I would stay there again, simply because of the fact that for the price the location cannot be beaten. We felt safe even late at night and we were right by the shops.PS: there is no air-conditioning indeed, but being San Francisco you don't really need it, and the hotel is not trying to hide it as it says so on their website. We stayed in mid-June and the lack of air-con did not bother us at all...

<Content>Great location The location of the hotel at union Square is perfect for accessing all areas of San Francisco and the cable car passes right outside. We were on the 13th floor overlloking Union Sq, so had a great view of the city. My partner was celebrating his 40th birthday and there was a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine, chocolates and a photo frame waiting in the room when we checked in as a gift, which was a lovely touch and a great start to our stay in this great city. The room was spotlessly clean and the general attitude of all the staff towards customer service is excellent. All staff are very friendly and helpful, a special mention to Matt who seems to really enjoy in his job.Great place, a great stay and I would not hesitate to stay at The Chancellor when I am in San Francisco next

<Content>A Fantastic Find My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 11/9 - 18/9/07. I booked the trip as a surprise 40th birthday present for him but we decided to travel in September to coincide with our wedding anniversary. Like many other people I had emailed Wes in advance and he pre-allocated us a nice room (room 1003). It was a corner room with a side view of Powell/Union Square and we couldn't fault it. The decor was lovely, the bed was nice and comfortable, the bath amazing and the power shower was an added bonus. Unlike some people we didn't find the room small - it had a Queen bed, dressing table, coffee table, two chairs and two bedside tables. The closet is massive  you can easily store your suitcases out of the way. The bath is also huge and you can actually fit two people into the bathroom fairly comfortably. In addition to our great room we also received a load of gifts from the hotel in recognition of both my husband's birthday and our anniversary - whilst we really, really appreciated this it is not the free stuff that sets the hotel apart from others, but the attitude of the staff and the absolute attention to detail. Everyone we encountered was professional, helpful, happy and keen to help. The free cookies and coffee are welcome (and delicious) but the hotel breakfast in Luques is also really good. Portions are huge, service is great, there is a wide range of choice with daily specials and the prices are reasonable - we dined there several time and it was always great. In addition to Luques we also found two really nice restaurants - Scalas, directly across the street (beautiful Italian food  great service) and Colibris on Geary Street - if you do go there the guacomole is a must. It is made fresh in front of you and is delicious - and the creme brulee is even better.The things we enjoyed most in SF are as follows:A trip to Muir Woods and Sonoma Wine Country. We booked with Extranomical (as recommended by Wes) and it was a fantastic experience. This company showed us 3 different wineries and also lots of the sights  history of SF; A trip to Alcatraz - we took the evening tour, which is really atmospheric but you must book in advance if you want to go; A bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito  then the ferry back. Sausalito is well worth a trip but note some bike companies will only hire if you have photo ID - Blazing Saddles does not ask for photo ID; The Musee Mecanique at Fishermans Wharf is a museum dedicated to old arcade games  attractions. Everything works and only costs 25 cents to play - it's a great laugh.Our Top Tips - If you plan on riding the cable cars, buy a MUNI pass. You can get 1, 3 or 7 day passes for various sums. A one-way cable car ride costs $5 but you can use your pass on the cable car, MUNI  buses; All ATM's charge $2 or $3 per transaction. If you use the one in the hotel lobby it charges $2 but you can redeem your receipt for a $2 discount at Luques; Macys offers tourists 11% reduction on purchases - just take your passport when you're shopping.Finally - thanks again to Wes  the staff at the hotel - we would highly recommend you to everyone and hope to return very soon.

<Content>Handy for cable car Front desk staff at the Chancellor are so friendly and helpful. Gave us good advice on places to eat , which were all excellent.Rooms were very comfortable, perhaps slightly smaller than some US hotels but nonetheless excellent.Only grumble was about service at breakfast, which was slow and not particularly friendly, but as there are plenty good breakfast outlets nearby, this would not prevent us from staying there again.

<Content>Excellent stay, Excellent choice I traveled to SF by myself on business, for a conference at the Moscone Center. Needed a hotel within my employer's rather stingy daily limit. I was somewhat familiar with the Union Square area but would not have found the Chancellor without the great reviews from the TripAdvisor community. My first use of TripAdvisor for business travel but it won't be my last.This is a great property for business travelers. The room and queen bed were totally comfortable. The decor (see traveler photos) is warm and welcoming. Loved the high ceiling and ceiling fan for that at-home feel. My room had a walk-in closet with two luggage racks. Plenty of hot water in the bathroom. Staff friendly and not intrusive. No problems checking in at 10:30pm. Very quiet within the hotel. There was some city noise coming from Union Square but that's probably true of many area hotels. Overall a very clean and updated room yet the old-time charm of the building was still present.Wireless internet service free, fast, and reliable...encrypted with a separate network per floor. Two AC outlets on the desk. Really important features for those who need them.I did not try the on-site bar  restaurant but did see a couple of guests taking advantage of their restaurant table to review business plans. There is access to a nearby gym if you need it (I didn't have the time).Staff was helpful arranging shuttle and holding my bags after checkout while I spent a final day touring sites I never reached on previous trips: marina district, Palace of Fine Arts, Presidio/GG Bridge, GG Park, Haight-Ashbury, Alamo Square, and a sunset cocktail at the Top of the Marks (Intercontinental Mark Hopkins hotel, the view is well worth the cost of your drink). Get a muni pass and get going! The Chancellor is directly on Powell Street cable car line and you can board about 30 yards from the front door towards Sutter Street.I won't bother posting my photos as those from other travelers are quite accurate. I will definitely return to the Chancellor in the future on trips alone or with my wife.

<Content>Great stay. . .yet again! My husband and I stayed at the Chancellor for 5 nights (7-12 September 07). This was our second visit, and part of an anniversary trip, so I contacted Wes the manager before we travelled and he helped me to arrange a special treat for our arrival. Not only did we find a bottle of wine and a special gift for our anniversary, but some beers and nuts for my husband (he is a simple pleasures kind of guy!) The hotel room (1103) was great - we had a corner view of Union Square, and although we could hear the cable cars quite clearly, they just added to the experience of San Francisco. We purchased a pair of MUNI passes from the tour desk and made full use of them during our stay. We travelled regularly on the cable cars (which were quite busy, but another part of the San Fran experience). We also walked down to Market Street and caught the F Line historic trams, which go all the way along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's wharf. Top tip - take the $20 trip across the Golden Gate Bridge - it only takes 1 and a half hours, but you get to stop off at the Palace of Fine Arts and take pictures of the city from the other side of the bridge. We also took a $10 sunset cruise under the bridge, which was well worth the money, if a little chilly!!Anyway, back to the hotel - I didn't get the chance to meet Wes in person to thank him for his help in making our stay special, but I didn't really have the need to speak to any of the staff apart from at check-in, as we had no problems the entire duration of our stay. That said, whenever we made our way through the entrance foyer, we were always hailed with a greeting by whoever was on the check-in desk. Little things like that, along with the jars of sweets and rubber ducky, made our second stay at the Chancellor just as good, if not better, than our first.We had no reason to stay anywhere else when we came on this trip, and we still have no reason to change on our next visit. Look out Chancellor - we'll be back!!

<Content>Great place to stay The Chancellor Hotel is a great place to stay if you want to be in the very centre of San Francisco near to all of the shops. Though it is also not very far from anywhere else as we walked to e.g. Ferry Plaza within about 20 minutes. The Trams go right past the door on the Powell / Hyde line so there are no problems with having that San Francisco Experience.The room we had was not huge but was plenty big enough and the linen was crispy clean. The whole place is a little faded but this didn't bother us as we aren't into luxuriousness in our hotels as we spend most of our time OUT of the room and not in it! The room we had was great because whilst the hotel is in a busy area of SF, our room looked out on the side of the hotel and was on the 13th floor so we didn't have the traffic noise that maybe some of the rooms on the front, lower down may have had.The hotel staff were very friendly and were more than happy to assist us with information and even gave us a list of hotels to book on our last night because the Chancellor was full.The parking is literally only a 2 minute walk away and was well worth the additional money we paid to know the car was safely stowed and yet we could get at it for a trip to Berkley at the drop of a hat. All in all good no frills hotel and inexpensive for its central location and amenities

Yes, the rooms are tiny but if you are spending alot of time in your room you are missing a great city. Super friendly staff, easy check in and out, close secured parking. Free newspapers, coffee and cookies in the lobby, safe area. If you are a shopper this is your hotel!

<Content>Amazing Hotel The Chancellor is an excellent hotel and was a perfect place to start our honeymoon in USA. The staff were amazing - so helpful and friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble.We booked our 3 night stay directly through Wes the Manager at the hotel and we requested a room with a view of Union Square. We were given a beautiful re-modelled room on the 11th floor with a great view!! So thank you so much Wes - our wish was granted! Also we were left a lovely honeymoon gift of a bottle of wine and personalised photo frame - what a lovely surprise.We had breakfast at the hotel's own restaurant and it was absolutely lovely - great choice and generous servings! We also treated ourselves to room service on our first morning which was perfect.We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco - superb location, friendly staff and a lovely welcoming home from home atmosphere - thank you so muchGemma Running and Samuel Green

<Content>Great Stay! From making the reservation to checking out, we really enjoyed the Chancellor. Great location a few doors up from Union Square, with the Powell Street cable car running past the door (listen to the clanging bells from your room and you know you are in San Francisco.) Yes, the rooms are not over-sized but they are not small either. Our room--901--had been recently and tastefully renovated. The things that matter were great: the excellent shower massage, comfortable bed, in-room safe, etc.Had two fantastic breakfasts in Lucque, the hotel restaurant, ate too many free cookies, and got some great tips from the front desk people.We'll be back, hopefully much sooner than later.

<Content>Wonderful Stay, Wonderful Location, Wonderful Price We stayed at the Chancellor from 6/29-7/1. We had booked directly through the Manager, Wes.We had told Wes it was a special occasion and he made sure we got a quiet room as requested and even left us a bottle of champagne to enjoy. It was a very nice touch that we didn鈥檛 expect.The location for the Chancellor is great. It鈥檚 within walking distance to the stores and the cable car stops right in front of the hotel. The rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. We even took advantage of the pillow menu the second night. Every time we asked a staff member for help they were more then happy to give it.Take advantage of the muni pass you can buy at the concierge. They have a 1, 3 and 7 day pass for riding all the public transportation. It saved us a ton of money. I would stay at The Chancellor again in a heartbeat.

<Content>great place to stay we stayed there for a week in august and it was fantastic-it was our honeymoon and i emailed wes before we left and we had a bottle of wine and a lovely picture frame waiting for us-what a lovely touch. the staff at reception are great-a girl with dark glasses did a lot of work to print out info on how to get to petaluma so we were very grateful for that-it is so central and perfect for people who want to do some shopping-there is a great bar with good food about 5 mins away called foleys-highly recommend a visit-would stay there again in a heartbeat. the rooms are clean-not huge-who cares when you can explore the city from somewhere central! SF is great and so is the chancellor hotel

<Content>great value for your money!! We stayed at the Chancelor during the weekend of the 40th anniversary of the summer of love. (1st weekend of September) and it was great!. From the excellent staff to the rooms and the location; for us everything was great! The whole staff was extremely helpfull and friendly, the rooms were great and the location was superb! I was afraid we'd have to worm our way in the room after reading the rooms were small but this was certainly NOT the case. (we had a corner room on the 13th floor) Sure you dont have a whole ton of space but it was more than sufficient for a hotel room. I think if you want to experience San Francisco with their charming historical buildings then this is the place to stay! If you want a very spacious but nondescript room that could be anywhere in the world then by all means go to one of the large hotel chains. The water pressure is great in the shower. The beds are very comfortable. Even though we never used it, the room service menu is reasonable and has a good selection. Everything was very clean and again the staff was extremely helpfull when we had questions or requests. The days we were there, it was pretty warm (hot) outside and even without an ac the room was comfortable. We absolutely loved San Francisco and will certainly come back and stay in the Chancellor again!! A big thanks to the staff for helping to make this an unforgettable trip!!

<Content>Loved the Chancellor! Now I can see what all the fuss is about! I loved this hotel, from the great service to the location...no need to have a car, as everything is within walking distance. Checking in and out was quick, and they even had a room ready hours before the posted check in time. The room was nicely decorated, and felt larger with the high ceilings. Loved to hear the music and street sounds, as I had a front-facing room. Very comfortable bed with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was small, but clean, and the bath salts were a nice touch to sooth my sore feet! Coffee and cookies in the lounge were appreciated, and made the mornings that much quicker to get off sightseeing. There was as kiosk in the front lobby selling various things, although I only saw staff there once in my entire stay. I had the option of staying elsewhere, but chose the Chancellor and am thrilled I did!

<Content>Chancellor the Best Bet in San Francisco Ever since a friend of mine introduced me to the Chancellor Hotel on Powell street at Union Square 4 years ago I have not stayed anywhere else in San Francisco. While initially I thought that the location, reasonable rates, easily accessible parking, and comfortable rooms made it special, I have come to recognize that what really sets the Chancellor apart is the staff, their helpful attitudes and the exceptional service they provide.My biggest concern is that providing this review will make it more difficult for me to stay in the Chancellor for my next trip to San Francisco. This is indeed a special place.

<Content>Fantastic stay - would definitely return! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Chancellor hotel for 5 days in August. We selected the Chancellor based on the TripAdvisor reviews we read beforehand and I have to say that we were not disappointed. This was our first trip to San Francisco and I don't think it will be the last - for all subsequent stays we will choose the Chancellor. Location: You couldn't be better placed to explore the city. The hotel is right in the middle of Union Square, giving you easy access to great restaurants, shops and bars. We found it very easy to walk to all the key areas including Chinatown, Nob Hill, Fisherman's Wharf and the financial district and if we didn't feel like walking, then the cable car and cabs stopped just outside.Room: Was exactly what I expected. Bearing in mind the price, you aren't going to get 5* luxury but I am exceedingly fussy when it comes to hotels and it ticked pretty much every box for me. The room was adequately spacious with nice furniture. The bed was very comfortable and they offer every type of pillow you could possible imagine. The bathroom was fine too with a great shower and free toiletries. The room was cleaned daily. It could get a little warm from time to time, but I found I was cold a lot outside so it was a relief! A tip though, I would request a room away from Powell Street as it could get noisy with the cable car right outside. We were relieved to have a room at the back!Food: We ate at Sears for 3 mornings running which I can highly recommend. However, we ended up using the hotel restaurant for the last 2 mornings and I have to say that I wished we had gone there every day instead! The food was very good quality, a great selection (from unhealthy to healthy), reasonably priced and the staff were very helpful. Staff: The reception and restaurant staff were exemplary, particularly Rory who was very helpful with directions, change and advice for exploring the city. The tour desk lady was also good, although a little abrupt at times. We found ourselves using the reception staff more as they always had a smile. The bar is serviced by their 'employee of the year' who was good but didn't seem to favour the tourists so much, more the regulars! If you want really friendly service I would go elsewhere. All in all, this should be your No.1 choice for a hotel whilst staying in San Francisco! A couple of other tips for the city in general:- Book a night tour to Alcatraz - easily the spookiest way to explore the former prison and escape a majority of the crowds- A wine tour to Napa is well worth it - we used San Francisco Shuttle Tours and it was a brilliant day out with a very helpful tour guide ([--])-The bay does get cold so bring warm clothes and sensible shoes for all those hills- If you get time, hire bikes from Blazing Saddles and head over the GG bridge to Sausalito which is a beautiful little riverside town - very picturesque. - SF doesn't seem to have a late night life - we headed out for a drink at 10pm on a Friday night and everywhere was shut!

<Content>I have recommended The Chancellor to friends We found the Chancellor Hotel on Trip Advisor - and were very happy we did.The location is excellent 鈥?great shopping and dining all around the hotel. The BART, cable car, and street car are all within 3 blocks (do not rent a car - buy the MUNI pass).The rooms are small but very clean and nice - awesome bed and pillow menu.The staff could not have been any nicer 鈥?from the front desk to housekeeping.All this being said 鈥?it must be the best value in San Francisco as the room rates were at or below most in the area. If we visit San Fran again, we will stay here again.

<Content>Best Location, best place to stay and service I really did research before chossing the hotel to stay at SFO. And when I finally decided to go with Chancellor, the rooms were sold out. So I called up the hotel directly and left my details to contact me. They prompty called me back when they had a cancellation. The customer service rep provided me with all teh details and I selected the one with Parking. Off site Parking is only a few yards away.(very convienient).I checked in at around 12:45 midnight. Took me ONLY just 5 mins..that was awesome. The room was really clean (may be a bit small compared to other cities) but I loved the place. Room service was excellenet...When I checked out, it didnt even take a minute...The hotel is located on Powell street. A great location. I would definitely go back again to Chancellor.

<Content>"Amazing!! From Liverpool with Love!" Stayed here during our 2 week stay in USA for our 1st Anniversary. Staff are fantastic!! Nothing too much for them!! Young lad at reception seemed to work 24 hours a day!! He was brilliant!!! Great sense of humour!! Room was perfect!! We specifically asked for a room at the front because we wanted the City Centre hustle  Bustle!! We were disappointed because it was really quiet!! Those that have complained must be narrow minded infrequent travellers who are professional complainers!! I have travelled the world and paid $1000's on hotels and it would be great if they were all this good!!! Keep up the good work!!!

<Content>wonderful hotel wih great services It's one of the best hotels for a 3-stars class in San Francisco area. For the last 4 weeks, I have been staying at 5 different hotels in the Union Square area of San Francisco. This is the best one so far. I will not hesitate to go back to the Chancellor Hotel again.The room is nice and clean and it reflects recent rehab. and renovation; yet it maintains its classic character with modern comfort.The service is great and courteous...a lot better than other hotels that I stayed recently in the vicinity. The staff' s always available and very helpful, with a smile, and is ready to accommodate your needs.For me, one other attraction is that the hotel is located rigth next door to my favorite restaurant, the Sears fine foods...

<Content>Highly recommended My wife and I and our two teenage sons stayed at the Chancellor for 5 nights in August, 2007. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend the Chancellor to other travelers. Foremost, the hotel offers excellent value for the price in terms of its terrific location. We had connecting rooms on the 8th floor facing the front. While the rooms are not large, they are very comfortable and nicely furnished. The staff was consistently very helpful and the restaurant was great for breakfast. The hotel also offers nice extras like coffee and cookies in the lobby, free newspapers, free Wi-Fi access, and complimentary access to a health club a block away. The tour desk in the lobby is also very helpful. The only issue to keep in mind is that the hotel does not have air conditioning and keeping windows open at night could be a problem for light sleepers. We ended up closing our window overnight to cut down on the noise from the traffic below (the cable car goes right by the hotel).

<Content>LOVED it ALL! I just have to say that a lot of these reviews are bizarre! Checking in was easy and simple. I flew in with my friend and check in wasn't until later but they put a rush on the room. We went to grab breakfast and when we returned, the room was finished. The room had a great view of Union Square. The room was really beautiful and amazingly gorgeous. It was clean, everything was great. I can't even describe how wonderful it was. The furniture was amazing, dark and really great. The bathroom was somewhat small but it fit our needs. The closet was a large size and had a safe. The hotel gave options of spa amenities that we could use. They also gave the option of pillows from firm to softer and for legs, etc. It was much more than I expected. There is also a bar and a restaurant and a complimentary computer that you could use whenever. The the two nights that we stayed there, it was comfortable and more than I really expected. It's near everything that we could have dreamed about. It's near the bars, shops, food, everything! This hotel is amazing and really something true to the heart of San Fran. I wish that everyone stays here because it was worth more than I paid, honestly!

<Content>Great experience and location This hotel is charming: it is perfectly located in Union Square on Powell Street (with the cable just in front). Rooms are very nice (European like, so a little bit small compared other hotels but quite sufficient), cleanness perfect, very friendly staff. You have free wifi access. Breakfast was delicious !You have everything located close to the hotel: shopping, book stores, restaurant, and with the cable in the same street it is very convenient to go everywhere.The parking is located 1 block from the hotel ($22 per day), you can have your car whenever you want, it is very convenient given the mess to park in SF....Definitively recommend it.

<Content>A Great Place on Union Square Our recent stay at the Chancellor turned out to be a very pleasant experience and a great value for the money. The reservation clerk at the hotel built a custom package that met our needs perfectly. The room was on a upper floor and faced Powell St., as requested. The rooms here are small (as expected, but it doesn't rain in S. F. in the summer, so who stays in their room!) However, there were multiple amenities, even the promised rubber ducky, the beds were comfy with upgraded linens, the bath was also small, but well-equipped with multiple mirrors, hair dryer, extra towels, etc. and there was a huge closet ! We had a food credit, which we used at the on-site restaurant for breakfast, delicious food and a great server at 7AM in the morning! The desk clerks were exceptionally helpful, always cheerful, and the cookies, tea and coffee were always out. This hotel has free internet service for guests, so we we were able to print out boarding passes very easily and check email too. This hotel is also a short walk/bus/BART to just about anywhere you want to get to and the desk clerks will help you figure it out! We also had a car for part of the stay, the in-and-out was very convenient and the parking garage attendants always pleasant and helpful. I have stayed in several other hotels around Union Square and this one beat them out by a mile!

<Content>Great location for shopping! We stopped here for four nights on our honeymoon.This a small hotel but presented well. The front desk staff were very welcoming and made an effort to treat us as valued customers. As it was our honeymoon they had allocated us a very nice room, quite high up and freshly decorated. The style of the room was very nice and the finish was excellent. Looking at the floor plan it was one of the biggest on the floor, however, had we been stopping any longer it may have started to feel too small but for a short stay it was fine.In the room we were greeted with sparkling wine and a souvenir photo frame which was a really nice surprise. The rubber duck was a great quirky touch in the bathroom. The free Wi-fi was also a bonus and very useful.The location of this hotel is fantastic. Opposite Sak's, two minutes from Macy's and next to Borders Book shop (great for a late night coffee and cake).We could hear very little street noise but we were quite high up. There was no air con but the ceiling fan was fine.I would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Great accommodations and service The Chancellor San Francisco clearly deserves its great reviews. The location, service and cleanliness are five stars, and the rooms are good three star rooms in a well maintained boutique hotel. Bottom line, the quality to price ratio cannot be matched. In a city with overpriced hotel rooms for questionable accommodations, the Chancellor is a standout.

<Content>Great starting point to a beautiful city I booked this hotel through Trailfinders and after researching it on tripadvisor.com . Excellent location-just off Union Square-close to not only cable car stop but also Alamo car rental a 5 minute walk away. Chinatown in close proximity too.Small lobby but well staffed efficient reception and very informative trip service desk with adjoining small shopping kiosk.Rooms were fine-don't be put off by the fact there is no air-conditioning-the ceiling fans were fine.Also we expected it to be quite noisy at night-not at all-no problems. No coffee/tea makers in the rooms but in the lobby coffee and teas available around the clock-just help yourself and no charge. Also mouth watering cookies and muffins as well ! A jar of sweets-replenished daily-was also in our room. I musn't forget there is even a pillow menu-you can try different pillows to aid your sleep !Close by were excellent shopping and dining facilities. We had breakfast twice in the hotel-daily specials-all around $9. I've had better but it was very convenient.Staff throughout the hotel were very helpful without being in your face.I would thoroughly recommend this as an excellent base to explore this beautiful city and surrounding area-about 35 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf so take a cab.

We were extremely pleased with the room we were given and my wife was very surprised and happy to receive a birthday card from the staff, together with a bottle of wine to celebrate and a gift of a photo frame.

<Content>Great staff, great hotel Our 4 night stay at the Chancellor was fantastic. The entire staff could not be more friendly or helpful. The location was great; we had no trouble getting anywhere from here. We did not shop much but for anyone looking for shopping this is an ideal location as well. We had requested a quiet room and were given a room on the 15th floor in the back. We never heard anything and so were well rested for each days adventure. Our room size was adequate and very clean.The staff was extremely helpful recommending restaurants, always had a smile and made us feel genuinely at home. The cookies on the counter were much appreciated each day when we returned from a long day of sight-seeing, before getting ready for dinner.The Chancellor came highly recommended on many travel sites and we now know why. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others. You will not be disappointed. Thank you to the staff for making our stay so enjoyable!

<Content>Wonderful Service I came to S.F. with my boyfriend- check in staff was attentive and friendly with advice. Got up to our room and was surprised to hear a knock at the door. A hotel staffer came in and gave us a bottle of wine and two photo albums, compliments of the manager! Apparently my boyfriend e-mailed the hotel explaining our vacation, and asked for a room on a high floor if possible. The attention and care we received far exceeded my expectations for such a low price for a hotel downtown in San Francisco. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting! The elevator was slow, but its an old building so its to be expected, the service more than makes up for it!!

<Content>Superior Service All Around We just spent 4 wonderful nights at the Chancellor Hotel from August 5 - 9th. We were on our honeymoon, upon arrival there was a bottle of wine awaiting us in our room. The entire staff went above and beyond to meet all of our needs. I can't say enough about how polite everyone was. We owe special thanks to our housekeeper Alice, she had found a memory card to our camera we never knew we had lost, it had some of our pictures from our wedding reception on it, we would have been devestated had we gotten home and discovered it missing. The hotel was exceptional clean and the rooms were more than sufficent as far as size goes. The location couldn't have been more perfect, close access to many restuarants, shopping and of course the cable car. We would definately stay at the Chancellor again and again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the San Francisco area.John and Betty P.

<Content>Excellent......well done Wes and staff We arrived after a long journey from Ireland to a wonderful reception from the Check In staff. We were in room 905 with side on view of Union Square and newly refurbished - extremely comfortable room and the welcome note, chocs and wine were a really nice touch. We cannot add too much more to previous reports, the hotel delivers on everything. It has its own unique personality is so smoothly run that your stay is bound to be perfect but if you do have any queries/issues I am sure that Wes and his staff will do whatever they can to resolve them. Really liked the little bar, just off reception. Alicia is a great bartender and is very friendly with a bright personality. We had breakfast one morning - very good and room service one afternoon (when the legs really needed a break), it arrived promptly was reasonably priced and very tasty. If we were to return to San Francisco (and I do hope we will someday), we would definitely return to the Chancellor - great location, great accommodation and great staff. Well done to you all.

<Content>Tripadvisor reviews right on the mark yet again We stayed for three nights and booked it based on reports here and a Manager that cares about the hotels reputation.We were thrilled with our room on the 10th floor facing the back of the property which was nice and quiet.We received great service from check in to check out,staff that cared that everything was perfect and were pleased to offer advice on directions.As reviewed here, this hotel is great value,a location exactly where you want to be in the City,close to everything that you need,and a spotless room and bathroom.Walk to 44 Belden restaurant,Fino restaurant and The Jersey Boys a must do show if it is still on.Right next door the must eat at Sears for breakfast.You can get Bart from the airport and get off at Powell St and stroll up the street to the Hotel.Get the tram outside the door to the ferry for Alcatraz,[book on line before you leave] a must do,and shop at the big stores all around the area.This hotel is a must, for a visit to this great city.Will stay here on our return.

<Content>Amazing Hotel in a Fantastic Location Found this hotel through TripAdvisor, booked it and then found it was recommended in guide books.This hotel provided everything we imagined and more. The main criticism on TripAdvisor is the rooms are small so we weren't sure what to expect on opening the door. The rooms aren't large by American standards but a couple from England disagree! More than adequate space, enough to fit in a queen size bed and chairs and table with a walk-in closet and ensuite bathroom.The hotel has a certain charm about it which we didn't experience in any of our other hotels during our stay. The restaurant served delicious breakfasts at a reasonable cost. On arrival we found the hotel's signature items ... the plastic duck in the bathroom and monogrammed towels but also candy, sparkling wine and a picture frame. Hotel staff are extremely friendly, helpful and welcoming.Union Square provides a great location for this hotel, with the cable cars outside the front entrance, with buses, F streetcar and BART a short walk away. We actually did a lot more walking than expected as Union Square is superbly located within the City with a lot of the main tourist areas a short walk away - though the hills were incredibly hard work!Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and we intend to return. Thanks Wes for a fantastic stay - we have fallen in love with San Francisco and the Chancellor...

<Content>Previous reviews spot on! We have just returned from a four night stay at the Chancellor. On return I have checked the latest reviews on the hotel and have nothing to add - everything is spot-on! I too liked the fact that the manager responded to comments (other managers take note). We were on 13th floor overlooking the road, yes it was a little noisy at night but I have stayed on the 30th floor in NYC and you can still hear the traffic, it is a city when all said and done.We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast a couple of times and also, as we were up early, ate at Sears next door. However, when we walked past at 9am another day there was a queue going half way up the street so if you're hungry, get up earlier! We also had dinner in the evening at Sears which was very good - the chicken smothered in cheese - excellent! We also went to Lori's Diner up the road which we enjoyed, good old nostalgia trip and perfect onion rings.Would cetainly recommend this hotel to anyone who asks, perfect base for sightseeing and shopping (we like Macy's restauarnt on the top floor - The Cheesecake Factory - very good views and excellent lunch) and easy for collecting our Alamo car hire which is just around the corner.Am envious of anyone who is just about to return there, I'm sure you will love it, just ope the weather is a little warmer and that you see the Golden Gate Bridge - it wsa covered in fog all the time we were in SF!

<Content>A Gem in Union Square Thank you Chancellor Hotel.The staff was very helpful ( printing out directions for us) There is a Computer in the lobby for use at no charge.I had found the Chancellor on Trip Advisor and booked two rooms for my Father -in Law and my husband and I . We had been in monterey for a family wedding and this was our last night before flying home.The rooms are very small but it reminded me of European hotels but this one is much nicer than what I stayed at in Paris. The rooms were newley refirbished and very very clean and fresh. Very tastefuly decorated and we loved the curtians that keep out the early morning light. The hotel offers several types of pillows you can chose from if you do not like the ones in your room and its Free !!. Think of Down, hypoallergic, scented and many more.The beds have tailored bedding with down comforters. The room has no A/C but a celing fan and the windows opened up to let in lot's of air. You do need to close them at night as the city is loud, unless you like that. Yet, when they are closed you don't hear a thing. Impressive windows. The room has a safe, iron  board, soaps, shampoos etc and the signature yellow rubber duck for the bath. We were well taken care of and I would highly recomend the Chancelor... as long as you don't need a large room and like spotless and cozy comfort.. We did. They may have larger rooms I didn't ask but I am sure the excellent staff at the chancelor Hotel would be happy to help. They also offer portable spas for your in room bath. They charge a small fee but I am sure after a busy day in the city a little in-room pampering at such a reasonable fee is worth it. On another note, the Cable Cars pass by the hotel and you can purchase a day pass for $11.00 vs. $5.00 per ride. The hotel offers valet parking and they had our car back to us very quickly in the morning.. Thanks. Union Square is perfect for us who don't want to be in the touristy Warf area and the Chancellor Hotel gets a big A plus from me. Many thanks to Wes the manager.... :)

<Content>The Chancellor Provided a Magical Start to our Vacation! After reading reviews on this site, we thankfully booked a room at the Chancellor through roomrate.com. By the positive interaction I had had with Wes Tyler, who is the hotel's general manager, and his staff prior to our vacation, I was already certain we were going to have a wonderful stay at the hotel. We rode BART from SFO to the Powell St. station. We had a bit of an uphill walk on very crowded sidewalks to get to the hotel but it wasn鈥檛 too bad.Upon check in we were delighted to hear that we had been upgraded to a Romance Suite. This was a wonderful start to an amazing vacation. The lobby of the Chancellor is very lovely. Be sure to check out the elaborate crown moldings. The girl at check in was very welcoming and told us our room would be ready shortly. The delicious cookies I had read about were awaiting us in the lobby so I used our extra time to try one out-Yummy! We also bought our muni passes right there in the lobby. Soon our room was ready and we rode up the elevator to room 1502. I want to add here that contrary to some of the posts I had read, although our room was on the 15th floor ,we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator. We were pleasantly surprised again by the Chancellor with a wonderful collection of gifts including a lovely wooden picture frame, chocolates, champagne, glasses and a thoughtful card congratulating us on our 20th anniversary (Thanks Wes!). We were so touched. The suite was two adjoining rooms that seemed to have been two identical regular rooms at some point. One had a sofa bed, two chairs, a desk, TV, and a full bath. The other had a queen size bed, armoire, a 2nd TV, side tables and ANOTHER full bath! Upon entering the room with the bed, we felt as if we had tiptoed into the twilight zone. It was so bizarre; the bed had our same Croscill bedding that we have at home! What are the chances? Besides this, the print behind the bed is the exact one that I have in my living room here at home. The armoire was also strikingly similar to ours. I guess Wes and staff really wanted to make us feel at home but I must say it was a little freaky! It is an old hotel with lots of character. I loved the enormous arched windows in both rooms as well as the crown moldings and walk in closet. There were also hard candies and magazines provided in the room which was a nice touch. Both bathrooms had a slight step up to them as well as VERY deep bathtubs. Although the tubs had handrails, I could see where the bathrooms could be very difficult for anyone with mobility impairments. The bathroom amenities included swabs, cotton balls, soaps, shampoo/conditioner (bring your own if like me, you don鈥檛 like the mix), lotion, bath salts and an adorable rubber ducky (the ducky can go home with you, I asked!). The hotel also offered free wireless service in the room which my husband was very happy about. There was also free internet use in the lobby. In addition to the cookies, there were apples, coffee and fresh hot popcorn provided each day. There was also an extensive pillow menu that you could choose from with magnetic, snore stopping, bath and a variety of other pillows. We found the ones on the bed so comfortable that we didn't feel a need to try any others. The bed was also quite comfortable. Between the armoire, nightstand tables and the deep closet, we had more than enough room to store our belongings. There was also a safe in the room and a radio with an MP3 hook up. In the bathroom, there was a spa item menu that you could rent items from. Everything had to be returned by 12:00 the next day. There was a foot massager, bubble pad, a whirlpool machine and a variety of other items. I rented the whirlpool machine for my aching legs but it didn't seem to work very well, maybe because the tub is so deep. I let the girt at the desk know this and although I didn't ask for it to be done, I noticed I wasn't charged for it when I checked out.As we entered through the door of our room after exploring the city the first day, there was a strange intermittent blinking red light greeting us. Could it be that we had truly entered the Twilight Zone? As it turns out, there is a very large blinking neon sign for Harry Denton鈥檚 Starlight Room at the Sir Francis Drake right outside our room! We pulled the curtains shut which obliterated all but a slight twinkling rosy glow and fell asleep to the ding of the cable cars and the music of the night. We didn't find the light or the outside noise bothersome. We did have the window closed every night but the ceiling fan provided sufficient cooling. In case you don't already know, there is no air conditioning in the hotel! The trolley does stop right outside the hotel, but during our summer stay it was very busy unless it was early in the morning. There are many bus stops nearby and Chinatown, Nob Hill and North Beach are an easy (although sometimes hilly) walk. There are also lots and lots and lots of stores withing walking distance. We had a view of many of these as well as the square from our window.We did have the pleasure of meeting the celebrated Wes Tyler during our stay. He was as nice in person as he seems to be in his responses in the TripAdvisor forum. There was a fire drill planned at the hotel later in the day and although he seemed busy, he still took the time to meet with us. We thanked him for our spacious room and the thoughtful gifts that were left for us. All of the staff at the hotel were very friendly and personable throughout our stay. Check out was very simply and quick too.If you are expecting a luxurious, modern, state of the art hotel you will probably be quite disappointed here. If you are expecting abundant smiles and pleasant service, thoughtful (and quacking) amenities, wonderful architectural details in a historic building, and a fantastic location, your expectations will be exceeded!

<Content>Great Place to Stay - Very Professiol and Helpful Staff My wife and I stayed here for 2 days in early August. We were very happy and would stay here again. The hotel while old does have quite a bit of charm. The ceiling fans could work better. I did mention this to the staff and they sent up a floor fan. This more than did the job and hardly took up any floor space. Someone wrote that this hotel is too far from Fishermans Wharf. This is true but if someone could write that in an online review, they also could have checked and seen this online. The cable car to Fishermans Wharf is across the street and the bus is a 5 minute walk. The location is across from Union Square on a main street. Very hard to beat. We stayed on the 10th floor and did not have an issue with street noise by any means. The closet space is also extra large. While the rooms are not large by any means, the space is more than adequate. I have stayed in rooms that have less space and much smaller showers. Bottom line is you get good value, a good location, good staff and a good room. We would not hesitate to stay here again on a future trip.

<Content>service, service ,service! We read about Chancellor on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try. Sometimes boutique hotels do not meet the standards of their larger competitors, that is not necessarily the case here. The Chancellor has done an outstanding job of putting staff in place that understand customer service. They were extremely helpful in all ways at all tmes.The Chancellor has a lot of character. It is an older hotel that has been maintained very well. The rooms are not large, but they are adequate. The one thing the hotel does not offer is air conditioning. It would have been nice to know this since we arrived in a 'hot spell'. But the front desk brought in a fan that worked very well and we slept comfortably. Our room had a large, wonderful closet so we did not have to trip over our bags. The bathroom was snug, but certainly adequate. They had a nice jacuzzi tub that was large and my wife thoroughly enjoyed. The location is great, Union Square and the cable cars stop almost right in front of the hotel. The outstanding characteristic of this hotel to us was the service. The desk staff was friendly, very helpful and accomodating. The cleanliness was certainly a reflection of the staff commitment as well.It is definitely worth staying here just to experience true service standards.

<Content>Great inner city hotel - and great ambiance We read lots of reviews before booking and I agree with another writer that Wes's willingness to read and respond to comments was a plus.Yes, it is old and small but having stayed in lots of city hotels around the world where space is at a premium it is only to be expected. The location makes it worth it. Very central and the tram stopping outside the hotel makes a fun addition for tourists.I can't believe the guy below who thought a $10 note would get him respect. First because it is not required here - all the staff were great; helpful and friendly and there were always lots of front desk staff and porters around who helped us for no consideration and second because he's so cheap!!!Small, quirky shaped (in our case) rooms but very clean and comfortable and quiet. With an average temperature around the 70s AC is really not required; and the fan was adequate.Some recommendations regarding eating - hotel breakfast was very good and reasonably priced but we enjoyed Lorie's diner (one just up the road and one just down the road) - great fun and very efficient - the kids loved it.We ate at the restaurant next door which sometimes had long queues (forgotten the name) but it was very disappointing (dull American fixed menu - sorry) and service was poor - 10 minute wait at the bar for a table but no bar service and no wine list offered at the table. There was one but it took so long to get it the food was delivered!The Italian restaurant opposite the hotel was the fantastic - we didn't book a table (advised) but as we were early (6pm) and agreed to eat within the hour we got a table. Really great food served by friendly staff and the same price as the other restaurant. Wish I hadn't been with children as it had a very buzzy cocktail bar section and it looked fun.A find which was only a short 5 mins walk away was a small,classy but again reasonably priced French restaurant called Anjou. Off the beaten track but I'm sure the hotel staff can direct you. Food cooked by a chef who's travelled and was on site. Enjoy your stay - we did!

<Content>Extraordinary Hotel  My wife and I just returned from our summer vacation trip to San Francisco. This year, we stayed six nights at the Chancellor Hotel after reading many excellent reviews of the property on TripAdvisor. The hotel far exceeded our expectations. We stayed in Room 1000, requesting this particular room after reading reviews indicating how nice a room it was. The hotel graciously granted our room request. The room overlooked Powell Street, and on a clear day, we could see the Ferry Building Clock Tower. The ceiling fan combined with an open window provided more than adequate air circulation. The sounds of cable cars and street traffic were all part of the SF experience and were welcomed by my wife and me. Many people have noted the excellent location of the Chancellor with respect to shopping, tourist attractions, restaurants, etc... All of this is very true. We used mass transit (cable cars, streetcars, Muni trains and buses) to go wherever we wished to go. This was very economical (7 Day Muni Passport) and convenient. We took advantage of the Giants baseball package on two of the days of our visit. This not only allowed us to have terrific field level seating for the baseball games, but also provided us with food/beverage credits in the hotel restaurant and bar. We ate breakfast in Luques Restaurant (within the hotel) on three different mornings. The food was excellent (especially the French Toast) and the restaurant staff very pleasant. In fact, the entire hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and at home. Our room was more than adequate in size for two adults. The safe within the room was a very nice feature as was the extra large closet, and the housekeeping service was excellent. The hotel staff was gracious enough to store our luggage during the day we checked out until late afternoon since our flight home was a late night flight. It was a pleasure indeed to meet Wes Tyler on the afternoon of our departure. Wes is to be commended for running such a terrific hotel. On future trips to San Francisco, my wife and I would not dream of staying anywhere other than the Chancellor.

<Content>Great location, small bathrooms, excellent bang for the buck I stayed with my wife and small baby in the Chancellor for three nights and I had a good overall stay.The location is excellent, near Union Square, with many shopping places and restaurants and theaters nearby. It is also on the cable cars route if you want to use them. However, it is not a good location if you are mainly going to visit Fisherman's Wharf.We had a rental car and it was a little complicated to load/unload our luggages, but the garage a half block away was easily accesible and open 24 hour/day, though a little pricey ($22.00/day, because of the location). You can also get valet, but it will cost you $34.00/day and you may have to wait longer.We had a room on the 15th floor (1500) and it was on the small side, but not too bad, considering it fit a crib without too many problems. The bathrooms are very small, although the tub is large and the shower good and they change/add toiletries daily. There was a little mold on the paint near the shower, but I think it can be fixed easily with some paint job. The closet was astoundingly enormous, a walking closet! with a safe and ironing board/iron. There is no A/C, we had a fan in our room but it was never hot. We liked being on the last floor (15th) because the ceiling was really high (20 feet at least) and the window was as well really tall, plus I think we got less of the street noises. We did not try the restaurant for breakfast but appreciated the free cookies and coffee available at the bar.Staffing was helpful and corteous, there is a small tour organizing area with a very nice lady that was helpful to us in a few occasions.Overall a pleasant stay, would recommend to others.

<Content>Great central location Stayed five days at the Chancellor Hotel, great location, great weather, close to everything, shopping, siteseeing, trolleys, Union Square, China town and easy access by trolley to Pier 39 and the waterfront. Did not use a car during our stay. Selected the Chancellor Hotels from several in the area due to non smoking hotel, no pets allowed, and for discount given for 5 day stay. The best value of the ones considered.Staff was attentive and helpfull and provided suggestions on restaurants, transportation and events in the area. Restaurant in hotel was convenient and great for breakfast.Room was mid level at the rear of the hotel, as per our request, it was well furnished, quiet, clean, good size for an older establishment with a large closet, window opened for fresh air. We look forward to a return trip to San Francisco and staying at the Chancellor Hotel.

The location is great, right near one of the tram stops and close to restaurants and shopping. The room was kept really clean. You can help yourself to coffee, tea and cookies in the reception area and there is nice bar for a drink at the end of the day. Sweets in the room were a nice touch. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Ok but was expecting more for the money Spent 3 nights at the Chancellor Hotel on Union Square. Location is good if you want to go shopping but the Piers and Fishermans wharf are too far away and on foot are about a 45 minute walk.The room was too hot, rather small and the bed was way too soft. Not sure that it was great value for money either - I had a suite in Caesars Palace, Las Vegas for the same money the following week.Overall it is ok but not as good as I had hoped.

<Content>Excellent location This is all about location...if you want a reasonably priced hotel centrally located you'll find it hard to beat. It's literally feet (about 20!) from Union Square - you have restaurants, diners, all the main shops and a great atmosphere on your doorstep. In terms of the accommodation itself - it's good, very clean small room with small but adequate bathroom. I would definitely return.

Also adjacent to a cable car line which can take you to Fisherman's wharf (if a moment of madness seizes you).The staff at the hotel were very friendly, helpful and courteous. We would thoroughly recommend a stay here.

It is right in the center of things with lots within walking distance. There were numerous clerks that were very friendly and helpful with advice on all manner of things and were available all hours. Also, Gray Line will stop here for pickups. On a Saturday, I checked out at 5:30 a.m. and cabs drive by so frequently I had one within minutes. I would highly recommend.

We have travelled extensively in the U.S. and Europe for the past 40 years, and have seldom experienced a hotel that pays as much attention to detail as this one does. We stayed in Room 1004, which was just renovated, and very quiet.

<Content>Super! We stayed in the Chancellor Hotel in June, 2007 and had a wonderful experience. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and the hotel lobby and bar were nice. Our room (1203) far exceeded our expectations. The decor was very tastefully done, and the bed and bedding very extremely comfortable. We found out upon check out that our room had recently been redecorated. So if you reserve a room, I recommend that you request a refurbished room. The other rooms may be nice as well, but we were extremely happy with ours. We booked our room through Expedia for $99/night + taxes. The location could not be beat! We were right on Union Square, and the trolley stopped right in front of the building. City busses were also very accessible and take you pretty much anywhere you need to go. Great bars and restaurants abound! Go to Dottie's True Blue Cafe (522 Jones St) for a great breakfast!Traffic in that area is a little crazy. If you are driving a car, there is a hotel loading/unloading zone in front of the hotel (going south on Powell Street). Park your car there, unload your bags, and request parking instructions from the front desk staff. They'll give you a map to the parking garage, which is just around the corner. Parking is $25/day in that garage.

<Content>Not Impressed We stayed 4 nights in beautiful San Francisco in April 2007. We were scheduled to stay at the Cancellor Hotel for the entire trip. However, we decided to only stay for 1 night. The rooms were terribly small for the rates. In this case, we were basically paying for the location. Their website was much nicer than the reality. The best thing about the hotel were the cookies at the front desk.

<Content>Loved the Chancellor! We stayed at the Chancellor from June 27th to July 1st, it was our first trip to San Francisco and we booked the hotel due to the good reviews on Trip Advisor.We were not disappointed.....this hotel was great, perfect for us. It had a lot of character and the staff were so helpful and pleasant. I had booked directly with the manager, Wes Tyler and got a good rate and at the time of booking had requested a room on a high floor with a view of Union Square. We got a room on the 15th (top) floor at the front of the hotel with a great view (thanks Wes!!!). The room was spacious and had a huge cupboard which took both our cases. The room was clean and comfortable and we had a great stay. Alicia in the bar was very helpful and answered all our queries on bars/restaurants to visit. The lady on the tour desk arranged our shuttle back to the airport and provided information on busses and cable cars - we bought a 3 day Muni Pass for $18 each - excellent value!If we ever return to San Francisco we will definitely stay at the Chancellor! It is a lovely hotel.Helen

<Content>What!!! No A/C? First off, I can't believe this hotel doesn't have a/c, geesh! Also, only 2 elevators? What's up with that? The rooms were so small and the outside noise was unbearable and what is up with the paper thin walls? I could hear everything my neighbor was saying! We nearly starved in the morning by their non-existent breakfast, cookies and coffee only! To top it all off, we were harassed by a vagrant outside the hotel!OK, none of that is true. Did I trick you Wes? I read every single review before visiting this hotel and researched the hotel's web site and others. I got exactly what I expected and we had a great time. I am always hot, but there really is no need for a/c in SF. We actually closed the window at night because it was a little chilly. I can't see a need for anymore than 2 elevators? We never had to wait more than a minute or two for it to come. The rooms were a bit small compared to other hotels I've stayed, but we spend only sleeping time in the room. Even if we spent more time in the room, I don't believe I would have a problem with the size. Yes, when the window is open, it is very noisy outside, but I enjoyed it. I live in a quiet suburb and it was exciting having the business of the city right outside. When I did want it quiet, we closed the window and hardly heard a thing, we were on the 6th floor not the 15th. I'm not sure what people are talking about paper thin walls. Our walls in room 600 were solid masonry. Maybe we didn't have any neighbors during our stay, but I couldn't imagine it being noisy still. The hotel never advertised any breakfast of any kind, so this was not a shock. But the cookies were delicious and we had one everyday, I'm not a coffee drinker, so that didn't bother me. Sears Fine Food next door has a great breakfast. And yes, there are homeless people and street entertainers on the streets of San Francisco that will ask for money, but I don't know if there are any hotels in SF that can say this won't be the case.Overall it was a great stay and like most people have said, the rooms are clean, the staff is helpful (all of the staff I encountered spoke English very well), it's a great value and great location. If you do just a little research, you will have no surprises. The last thing too, any hotel with a GM who cares enough to read all these reviews and takes action is the GM of a hotel I'd like to stay.

<Content>Very nice hotel and staff We really couldnt ask for anything better, we had a great stay and the price was right. We have stayed at alot of hotels that cost alot more and recieved alot less. The Chancellor had everything we needed in the way of comfort, location and service. The staff was great they were very friendly and helpfull. The room was very comfortable, clean and quiet and had just been newly remodeled. We were walking distance to almost everything and the trolly stop was right outside the door. The hotel is older which adds to its charm but it is maintained and kept as well as any 5 star hotel that we have stayed in. Thanks to everyone at The Chancellor for a wonderful time. Jim  Holli M.

<Content>SPECTACULAR in SAN FRAN!!!!!! What an amazing place to stay in San Francisco. I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said on here by hundreds of other posters. The location is amazing, simply central to everything. Cable car right outside your door. What I can offer is that I really don't understand people who have posted on here and complained the rooms are too small. NOT TRUE. It is a nicely sized room for a boutique hotel of its vintage and quite honestly still comparable to many rooms that are much much newer. Bless you all that read and post on this site but I think too many of you, especially those of us here on the West Coast have been spoiled by the luxury SUITES in Las Vegas and compare those to regular hotels. Remember, those are suites and they're primary goal is to get you into their hotel so that you gamble and leave all your money behind. That's not so with this hotel. I found the staff to be extraordinary, they never tried to upsell me anything, whether it be tours, upgrade rooms or even their room service or restaurant. In fact I asked several of the staff for advice on numerous things and they always suggested what would be the easiest and cheapest way of doing things. I found that very refreshing. They spoke to me as a friend and not some pre-rehearsed routine like so many of the big hotels do. They weren't trying to take my money, they were trying to help me enjoy my whole San Francisco experience. I'm not sure what General Manager Wes Tyler puts in their water, but whatever it is...it works. They entire staff has bought into it and the funny thing about it is, I think he's told them to just be themselves and not worry about impressing the guests...BUT I AM IMPRESSED. As I mentioned earlier, this hotel is everything you need or want, the location is great, the rooms are great, the rooms are spotless ( big thing for me ) the amenities are great but most of all the people and service here is second to none. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and I hope that Mr. Tyler has some big plans to celebrate the Chancellor's 95th and 100th Birthdays because I will definitely be back.!!!!

<Content>Perfect hotel to start our honeymoon We had the pleasure of starting our honeymoon at the Chancellor Hotel as part of our three centre west coast US visit to San Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. I chose the hotel as it was recommended by Trailfinders who said their guests loved it, and despite extensive research on the net and Tripadvisor I could not see another hotel I would prefer.We arrived at the hotel at 1.30 am after a nightmare 24 hour, 3 flight due to plane delays, journey from the UK (7 hours late). After taking a minibus from the airport we checked in and were warmly welcomed, no queue due to lateness of the hour. I had emailed the manager in advance and he had allocated us a high floor (14th) room with a view of Union Square as requested. A bottle of wine on ice and a lovely giftwrapped photograph frame were waiting for us due to this being our honeymoon. I must be in the minority as I did not think our standard room was small at all, average and above average compared to many UK hotel rooms (it was half as big again as the room we spent our wedding night in, in Scotland, although I appreciate many US hotels have larger rooms) and, given the massive walk-in cupboard with two luggage holders for storing our suitcases and hand luggage, I found the room spacious and not cramped at all. Nice sized bathroom with toiletries and bath salts as well as the renowned rubber duck! I also chose from the pillow menu the next day. I knew there was no air conditioning as it is listed against all the information you read about this hotel, e.g brochures, Tripadvisor, net info and hotel website so It's really not a surprise. We found the ceiling fan to be sufficent in October. We never had to wait long for a lift/elevator and I never noticed any shabbiness in the bedroom or public areas which other guests have remarked upon (and our visit was some time ago before renovations). Maybe I am lax in choosing not to inspect every surface and drapery looking for minor flaws but I was on holiday and it all seemed ok to me.The location is spot on, right next to Union Square and 2 cable car routes. It's not far to walk to get onto the various bus routes either, Susan at the Tour Desk told us the buses we needed to get to Golden Gate Park for example. She also booked our return transport to the airport. We received two complimentary $5 cable car postcard passes on check in, but as we purchased the excellent value $18 3 day muni passes, we kept these as souvenirs. I loved riding the cable cars for fun as well as for getting places. We found the people very friendly and the city very cosmopolitan, I was surprised how much at home I felt. Had a lovely boat trip on the Bay under the Golden Gate Bridge and a separate ferry trip to Alcatraz which is unmissable - make sure you get the audioguide tour. An ex-inmate Darwin Coon was signing copies of his book on the day we visited Alcatraz and answering questions - an unexpected bonus.The hotel does a nice breakfast and we used our 10% discount coupon given at check in for this. We also had to visit Sears Fine Foods next door given the high recommendations it receives but I found little difference between the two. We also had a good value breakfast at Lefty O'Doul's two blocks away and enjoyed visiting this bar at night too. Met some very interesting people! Alicia at the bar at the Chancellor was attentive and my husband had a few drinks here through our visit whilst waiting for me to get ready oh and to watch the sports on TV. Various complimentary foodstuffs and tea/coffee are available in the lobby although we never took advantage of these due to eating so well. Location wise we much preferred the city centre location as compared to Fisherman's Wharf (an easy cable car ride away), plus you can walk lots of places, Chinatown is not far, and we used the buses, cable cars and streetcars to go further afield. I had added San Francisco to our trip after deciding against Hawaii and it went from being our third choice city to first place. I definitely left my heart in San Francisco and can't wait to go back. And we will be very disappointed if we don't get a room at the Chancellor.

<Content>LOVED LOVED LOVED the Chancellor!!!! We stayed at the Chancellor from June 18th through June 23rd. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The location is excellent - right in the heart of Union Square. With a Cable Car stop right outside the door and buses within walking distance it is very easy to tour the city with the Chancellor as your home base. I loved the old world charm of the hotel. Yes, our room wasn't the biggest room I've ever stayed in, but it was recently updated and really pretty. The huge walk-in closet provided a nice place to store our suitcases, bags, etc,. without cluttering up our bedroom/sitting area. I especially loved the glass doorknob on the closet door. It reminded me of my Granny's house when I was little. The bathroom is small, true, but very efficient and ample for what needs doing in a bathroom. The bed was very prettily made with a very cushy white comforterand was extremely comfortable. The Chancellor offers a pillow menu, but my pillows were great so I didn't even consider changing them. 1103 is a corner room with a street view. I know that some people have complained about the street noise, but personally found it added to the ambience of the city. I loved going to sleep and waking up to the ding ding of the historic Cable Cars! I also have to give kuddos to the staff of the Chancellor. They were all so helpful and friendly. I enjoyed visiting with them very much. They were also very helpful when I was deciding on the best possible mode of transportation to wherever I was headed to on a given day. The free internet access in the lobby was a great way to stay in contact with home and I ate more than one delicious cookie that was available in the lobby every day. In short the Chancellor is a GREAT place to stay while visiting San Francisco!!!!!

<Content>Stellar Service at the Chancellor When planning my trip to San Francisco, I researched hotels for months. I chose the Chancellor because of location, price, and most importantly, the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. Not only was I not disappointed, I was totally blown away by the high level of service I received from the entire staff.This was my first time traveling a long distance alone with my 15-year-old daughter (we're from the east coast), and I was pretty anxious about the trip. My daughter has type 1 diabetes and is insulin-dependent. She is also a typical teenager. Having read about the small rooms, I was somewhat concerned that we would drive each other crazy. I requested a quiet room on an upper floor and a refrigerator for my daughter's insulin. We were given a corner room on the 14th floor at the back of the hotel. I found the room size to be perfectly fine. It was very clean, bright, and not crowded at all. As others have mentioned, the closet is very large. We had room for all of our stuff, and knowing how changeable the SF weather can be, we brought enough clothes for a month-long stay! The room was extremely quiet with the windows closed. However, our location was perfect for leaving them open and enjoying the sounds of the city without being overwhelmed by the noise. I can't speak about thin walls because the room beside us was empty during our entire five-night stay.The central location is excellent. We went all over the city and only used public transportation (get a Muni pass!) and foot power. Exploring SF this way really enhanced our experience.I cannot speak highly enough about the staff. One incident will stand out for me forever. The refrigerator in our room froze several cartridges of two types of insulin, and they could no longer be used. My health insurance company refused to allow me to use a co-pay when replacing the insulin. The total out-of-pocket cost was over $350! I was very shaken and upset. When I spoke to hotel staff, they immediately offered to buy the insulin for me. A member of the desk staff, Mike, walked with me to Walgreens, waited with me while the prescriptions were filled, and paid the pharmacy for the insulin. While we waited, he was very kind and reassuring. He told me over and over that I should not worry about anything and should just enjoy my trip. I am a single mom on a very tight budget. This meant the world to me. I will never forget that kindness. I get teary-eyed just thinking about it.Wes has stated over and over on Trip Advisor that if you need something, just ask. My experience is proof that he means what he says. I wish I could give the Chancellor more than five stars because they earned it. Wes, I know you read all of the reviews here. I wish I had met you in person. Thank you for everything. My daughter and I had a wonderful experience at your incredible hotel!

<Content>Very good place to stay with excellent location as well. We stayed at the Chancellor and had a nice time. Its is a traditional type of older property but service, cleanliness and staff are all excellent and the price is very reasonable. The hotel is very conveniently located and SF is fantastic of coarse. I highly recommend staying at the Chancellor.

<Content>A Wonderful Stay I had researched many hotels in SF but kept coming back to this one and I am glad I did. It was a perfect stay in a perfect city. My room arrangements had changed and the reception staff had no hesitation about changing my room which was done immediately on checkin (which was earlier than noted time). The tourist information was informative and friendly. My room was very comfortable and at the rear of the building so was very quiet. Bath products were heavenly and I just loved the little duck smiling at me every morning. Beds were comfy and room was a good size. Of course the location is superb, close to shops, transport, and theatre around corner (jersey boys was excellent if you get a chance to see it). Free internet at reception. Iam sure I will be back again. You cant go wrong with the Chancellor.

<Content>Great location Only stayed one night here, after reading the great reviews on this site. Very glad we chose to stay here. It was our first time to San Fransisco and the hotel was in a really good location to everywhere we wanted to go. Right next to Union Square and tons of shops and places to eat, on the cable car route and within walking distance of Fishermans Walk (although I have to admit getting the cable car back!). Staff were very friendly and bed was comfy. Only one thing I would mention - the walls were very thin. At 6.30am our neighbours decided to watch 'Blades of Glory' at max volume. We could hear Will Ferralls every word. I think the film is great - but not at that time of the morning. Everything else was great, we would return if we ever visit San Fran again.I read a tip on here to eat at Sears (next door) for breakfast - thanks, it was lovely!

<Content>Great Place To Stay in San Francisco June 16, 2007 - Just returned from a week in San Francisco. This was our first trip to this wonderful city, we had all kinds of recommendations on where to stay. Based on those and many hours of researching on the web, we chose to stay at the Chancellor Hotel in Union Square mainly because of the price for the room and the location of the hotel. We made a wise choice, the location of this hotel is excellent for a tourist and the price was about average for a room in the city. Located right in the middle of the retail center of the city, the are many retail stores, restaurants and local pubs to chose from. Do NOT rent a car when you go. When we arrived in the city, we took the BART train from the airport to the Powell Street station, which put us four blocks from the hotel. Only cost us $5.15 each for the train to the Powell street station. To get around the city, you can use the Cable Cars, which are right out front of the hotel, or catch one of the city buses which can get you to just about anywhere in the city at $1.50 a trip. However, you can purhase in the Hotel Lobby a Muni Pass which gives you unlimited access to the cable cars and buses during your stay. As for the hotel itself, it was very nice, it is an old hotel but has been well kept and is in great shape. The staff was very friendly, they were more than willing to help us with our questions and directions to various places in the city. In addition to purchasing your Muni Pass for transportation, you can also book all of your tours in the lobby at the same prices you would pay anywhere else. Very convenient. The only negative we have for this hotel, and it is not a big one, was the bed was pretty hard, took a few days to get used to. The rooms are small, but who wants to stay in their room when there is so much to do in the city? Highly recommend this hotel for a stay in San Francisco, made our stay a great one...Would definitely stay their again.

<Content>Great choice This was a great choice for our San Francisco vacation. The location can't be beat if you want to be near a lot of attractions. Coming from the airport, BART drops you off a quick few blocks walk away at Powell/Market (slightly uphill, so I wouldn't want to walk it with lots of luggage); Union Square is across the street with great shopping and some good restaurants nearby; the cable cars run by the front door (although it is not easy to get ON the cars at this location) and Chinatown and Market Street are an easy walk as well. We like to walk the city so we actually walked from the hotel to Fisherman's Wharf on two occasions, and also to and from the Embarcadero, North Beach and locations in SOMA without much difficulty as long as you choose your hills carefully.The room was clean and quiet. We were on the back side of the hotel on an upper floor so we got very little street noise. Considering there is no AC and the windows are were consequently open, we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are a bit small by US standards but quite comparable to better European accomodations. There are about 9 rooms per floor and they all seemed to be very well maintained. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the cookies at the front desk are a nice touch. Complimentary coffee and tea is also available near the two elevators.All in all, an excellent value and location. I would absolutely stay here on my next visit.

<Content>Very Nice Stay I stayed at the Chancellor for 8 nights, for a combination of personal holiday and business. My husband and I found the Chancellor to be very conveniently located,clean and with friendly and helpful staff. I was grateful for the 24 hour fresh coffee service in the lobby, along with easy-to-access free use of the lobby computer to check my email, plus in-room internet access. The concierge in the small lobby shop was very friendly and helpful. And it was a nice surprise to find popcorn, fruit and muffins available in the lobby throughout the week. All in all, a very good value and a pleasant stay.

<Content>Absolutely Loved the Chancellor! My family stayed in a suite at the Chancellor June 5-9th and had an absolutely wonderful time. When we go to San Francisco, the Chancellor is always our first choice because the staff and management go so far above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and memorable. The staff are extremely nice and helpful, the hotel has lots of character and charm, really comfy beds, an extensive pillow menu, fantastic cookies anytime you want them (the white chocolate macadamia are to die for!), complimentary rubber duckies for the tub (one of those old fashioned deep tubs that is perfect for a long soak after walking in San Francisco all day), the cable car stops almost at the door and the hotel has a union square location that absolutely can't be beat! I never would have believed that we could afford a hotel in San Francisco that is this wonderful - I'm ready to start planning our next trip!

<Content>Great Expectations Exceeded Chose to stay here in March on the back of the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor. There is not a lot to add that has not been said so many times before. GREAT service; GREAT location; GREAT value! It's not perfect but then where is? What is not in doubt is that Wes Tyler is totally customer focused and he runs an outstanding operation in which his staff follow his great example.On the subject of his example, I e-mailed a couple of weeks before my stay to ask for a high floor room with a view of Union Square if possible and specifically said there was no need for a reply - I was confident he would accomodate me if possible. In response got a personal reply from Wes in less than 24 hours (he was on holiday in Scotland at the time!) to say he would do his best to sort it. The result ...a room on the top floor of the hotel with a great view of US!Don't be put off by the minority who find fault - this is a great place to stay in San Francsico and I would not consider staying somewhere else.Thank you Wes for a fantastic stay - keep up the great work.

<Content>Nice hotel: great location, friendly staff, decent price My wife and I stayed here in early June of 2007. The location is very convenient - on Powell St, right on Union Square, along the cable car line. Sears Fine Food (an excellent breakfast restaurant) is right next door, and of course, there are all kinds of stores all around Union Square. We choose to pay for valet, which was convenient, but be aware it takes ~20 minutes to get your car - just plan ahead. The room itself was small, but adequate. Nothing too fancy, but nothing unsatisfactory either. Don't expect elegance, if you want that, go somewhere else. This hotel's strengths are its location, decent price, convenience, and friendly staff. We had a very good experience overall and would stay here again. We paid $160/night, with valet included.

<Content>Great Value to Price Ratio This hotel is smack dab in the middle of everything and a good value for the location. The front desk service was excellent and fast. We never used the room service but when we called downstairs with some questions about the city (we're tourists) they were more than happy to help us navigate around.The elevators are fast and everything was really clean.The only complaint was the really thin walls of our room. We could hear quite a bit of noise from our neighbors. I don't know how they could ever remedy that but I guess there has to be at least one flaw in an otherwise good hotel for the money.

<Content>You get what you pay for! We stayed here due to the great rate being offered and the favorable comments on TripAdvisor. This wasn't a terrible hotel and our room was certainly clean and serviceable but it wasn't a deal. The rooms are small and the hotel is being renovated to some degree but on our floor the carpet was in bad shape. Elevators are limited and the breakfast offering was almost non-existant. (Coffee and cookies). The location is great--half block off Union Square but the cable car tracks run past the hotel and that means that there is no double parking to unload and they have very limited curb space in front of the hotel. (My wife drove around blocks while I got us checked in without luggage and then the bellman drove our car around while we went up to put the luggage in our room.)There are many nicer hotels in the area for slightly more money.

<Content>Best Buy in San Fran! What a combination. The coolest, mellowest front desk staff always eager to help.Rooms that were a tad small but totally functional, quite stylish, and beds more comfortable than I would've imagined for a hotel that is such a value.I still am amazed by what a deal this place is. Literally steps from Union Square and right next to everything, including being right on the trolley line! If that weren't enough, just follow the street down and BAM! There's the BART station. I only got to stay one night but next time I plan on spending a week.The only negative is the smell of the lobby, it is quite old and musty no doubt. The room hallways too smell musty, however the rooms smell like...hold your breath...Twizzlers. Seriously! Appreciated the ceiling fan! Very nice touch.Great clock radios complete with CD player and aux in for MP3 players!And I thought I wouldn't get ANY sleep because of all the street noise down below...BUT the window when closed made the room sound like a tomb!Also I'm glad I got up before 10 AM on my own because there was drilling and hammering going on in a room close to me around this time. But whatever, small price to pay for all this PLUS free Wi-Fi.

<Content>Will definitely return to the Chancellor Hotel We have just returned from a fantastic weekend in San Fran. June 1st - 3rd. The Chancellor Hotel was great, I would not hesitate to recommend it. We received a warm welcome from the Desk staff, and found our room (#1205 ) to be exactly as expected, only cleaner. Every thing was spotless, even the fire escape outside our window was as clean as the inside of the building. We were welcomed by a personlized note from Wes and the Staff waiting for us inside our room, together with a bottle of wine and a picture frame. I have read some of the reviews on this site so I will add my comments regarding some of the complaints. We heard very little from other hotel guests while inside our room, only the occasional door opening and closing. The room did get a little warm but the ceiling fan took care of that and my husband and I had no trouble sleeping. The room is not large, but we had no problem with space, the closet was spacious enough for all of our luggage as well as our purchases, so the room remained uncluttered and plenty big enough for the amount of time we spent there. We helped ourselves to coffee in the lobby, and found that to be very convenient, along with the cookies and fruit, which were always available. The woman at the tour desk helped us with all of our transportation needs very effieciently. All in all, I am happy to say, this hotel was a great choice and I will definitely be back. To Wes and your wonderful Staff, thank you for a memorable weekend!

<Content>Pretty good hotel This is a pretty good hotel. It's good value given its location and features. However, good value means that you get a lot for your money, it doesn't mean that you get the Four Seaons at Motel Six prices. I stayed on the 13th floor and I don't know if this was a pre-renovation room but it could certainly use some updating. The furniture looked a bit old and worn, and the decor was okay, but not what I would consider a 'boutique' hotel. Having said that, everything else was above average. The bed was great, the windows provide very good sound insulation, and the bathroom was just fine. As to noise, yes, you can hear the street and you can hear your neighbors if they cough loudly. If you're sensitive to noise (I am) I recommend bringing ear plugs (I did), which will easily blank out the noise. I didn't try the restaurant or bar, so I can't comment on those. I was very impressed with the staff, who were unfailingly friendly, helpful, and efficient. They're probably this hotel's greatest asset.The location is also very good, close to lots of shopping and Chinatown, right on the cable car route, and a 5-10 minute walk to the Powell subway station. I would recommend this hotel if you want a good base to explore San Francisco from without paying too much, but don't expect luxury.

<Content>OK, other than the welcome Arrived after driving RV from Yosemite to Oakland then shuttle round San Francisco before reaching hotel, so, less than relaxed. Desk clerk more businesslike than welcoming, the only part of registration that stuck in my memory was the stricture that I would be charged a fee if I allowed the bath to overflow, a point requiring my signature on the reg. form. Have baths with overflow outlets not reached the west coast? Found our room to be overlooking the street and on 2nd floor, should have asked for another but didn't. Room itself was nice, reasonable size  clean, but no coffee or tea making facility  no bottled water. Noise on first night - revellers outside from 1:40am onwards - kept me awake. I know it's a city centre hotel  some noise inevitable but not much attempt made to minimise same, eg., double-glazing is aimed at heat retention rather than noise reduction. For second night we had purchased ear-plugs, very fortunately as they really diminished the noise from the road-works taking place outside overnight. Position of hotel very good, all facilities within a few minutes walk. Would not return to this hotel if certain others in area were available.

<Content>Great Location For Dining and Show My wife and I drove up to the city and stayed at the Chancellor for one night, after seeing an afternoon performance of Jersey Boys (fantastic), and eating at Aqua afterwards. The hotel was perfectly located for this, as we walked to the show, and then to our restaurant afterwards. No cabs necessary. Our room was very clean (although the hall stairwell carpet was dirty), the help was polite and attentive, and we also enjoyed the tiny bar on ground level. So all in all, very nice, and at a really good price.What prevents me from giving a higher rating was the noise level in our room. We were on the second floor, with Powell street directly outside of our room. The traffic noise, with the regular cablecars, then deliveries early morning, was high. Both my wife and I had difficulty sleeping, even after 2 bottles of wine at dinner! If you get a room such as ours, bring earplugs. I read many of the reviews before booking this hotel, but didn't see any problem with noise noted. Maybe these people had rooms off of the street level, on a higher floor. If it weren't for the noise issue, this hotel would rate a 4 to 5.

<Content>Just Awful! We were incredibly disappointed in this hotel. Please don't ruin your trip to San Francisco by staying here. First of all, the hotel is very, very shabby and there is NO air conditioning of any kind. You must have your window open to get any air at all, which means you must hear the street noise and traffic from the city streets below. Furthermore, not only was the open window noisy, but it also let in a bunch of flies which we could not get rid of. Our room was smelly, shabby, and noisy and there is no way I would recommend it to anyone. We go to San Francisco several times a year, and have done so for many years and I can honestly tell you there are many, many better places to stay for the same price in this lovely city. Avoid this place!!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - Highly recommended This place is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It has an excellent location on Union Square, the rooms while relatively small (it is a boutique hotel after all) are very well designed and really clean, with a safe, tv and cd player in each room.The staff are so nice and friendly - they just can't do enough for you. Mao in the restaurant (great breakfasts by the way!), Alicia in the bar (free popcorn was fab!), Matt the bellboy and Susie on the tour desk to name a few were all so good to us - no request was too much. The free coffee, cookies and fruit in reception is a great touch.All in all this was the best hotel we stayed in on our tour of the States.

<Content>Overall Happy Stayed May 2007, in town for business.Room 1300The +:- Great location, close to cable car, shopping, food!- Very pleased with the staff- Nice view, high floor, no significant noise issues - had to close window anyway at nights - chilly!- Free coffee and cookies downstairs in the lobby- Liked the small hotel character and the lack of a huge/commercial lobby- They had accommodated my request for hypoallergenic pillows and high floor (thank you)- Free wireless internet access with no problemsThe -:and Wes, don't get upset please...:-)- moldy smell upon entering the room- room needs updating (I think they are in the process), carpet needs help..., bed headboard needs replacing/cleaning, room needs better electricity plugs and they need to e made more accessible, lamp shades have stains- room needed more dusting, especially the walk-in closet and the bed headboardOverall, I was pleased and loved the convenient location, but I can only give 3 dots (neutral/average), only because of the above negatives. I was there for business and stayed by myself. I would return for a similar trip, but not for a family/couple stay until the renovation is completed. I think when the rooms get upgraded I will be able to give 4 or 5 dots.

<Content>Ok but I would not rave about Chancellor I would agree with most other reviews with one or two caveats.Position and price are the main things going for this hotel. Staff were courteous and efficent.Caveats are as follows:1. Our room had no airconditioning, only a ceiling fan which was totally inadequate with the warm weather we enjoyed during our stay.2 Breakfast was greasy and tasteless, quantity rather than quality, and not cheap.We only ate in on first day of our three day visit.3. Bathtub was smallOtherwise our stay was satisfactory.

<Content>Thanks again to all you Tripadvisors Yup, the rooms are small. But, with people living in homes built upwards is that any wonder. Space is at a premium in this town! Our room was clean and well equipped. There is no a/c, but we did not need it. There is a fan.At night they offer free coffee and cookies. We took their SF Giant Package and it was an incredible deal. You get two tickets per night for every night you stay or you can use them all on one night, if you have friends. The tickets are lower box seats and their face value is $33 each so do the math. Then, you also get $25 per day for use towards food at a very respectable restaurant in their lobby. Use it for room service, breakfast or lunch. The lunch we had was very, very good.The front desk staff was wonderful. In a city where the average room rates far exceed what we paid per night ($179) this place was a excellent choice. Thanks TripAdvisor members for the recommendation!

<Content>I WAS VERY SATISFIED AT THE CHANCELLOR While visiting graduate schools in the Bay area, my son and I stayed two nights at the Chancellor Hotel. We were very pleased with our reception from the front desk to the housekeeping. Everyone was pleasant , accommodating, and professional.We were on the thrird floor front, and the street noise really was not bad. So many complaints about the rooms being small must be from very large people. Granted you'r not sleeping in a handball court, but there was more than ample room for the two od us, our bags etc.... I have no complaints, and would return again. By the way, the cookies are fantastic!

<Content>Chancellor a Grand Place My husband and I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel May 5th - May 12th. We had a fabulous time. The rooms were lovely and clean. The staff friendly, polite and knowledgeable. We were originally assigned a room on the 14th floor, but after 2 nights reguested a room on a lower floor, our reguest was met with no guestions and we were moved to the 5th floor (my husband likes to take the stairs), our bags were even moved for us while we were out enjoying San Francisco. We had a room facing Union Square and the bells of the cable cars, the saxaphone player and sounds all a part of the grand experience of San Francisco. The sounds were easily diminished by closing the window. The staff in the lounge and restaurant were also very friendly. The 9 dollar breakfast in the restaurant more then enough for one person, and delicious. My only word of advise is if you are allergic to wool, have them remove the blanket from your bed. I acquired a rash on my legs I believe to be a reaction to the wool blanket. This is in no way a negative regarding the hotel, just a helpful hint. My experience at the Chancellor Hotel fantastic!! My kudos to Wes Tyler and his staff for their great hotel.

<Content>Great place Very nice experience. Great staff. I was there by myself for one night. NOT a place for kids, rooms are probably a bit to small for their energy level. Although the rooms are small they are very clean and comfortable. This is an older building that is lovingly cared for. The location is perfect for the single / couple looking to explore San Francisco. For the price, its the best deal going near Union Square and right on the trolly line.

<Content>The Perfect Choice Just returned from USA where the Chancellor was my first stop. I booked the hotel based on reviews on this website and my own research. Have stayed in many different types of hotels around the world, so knew what european boutique was.Was given a room on 13th floor at the back of hotel when I checked in (had made no special request). Was exactly as I expected and was not disappointed. Yes bathroom was small but you don't spend your holiday in the bathroom. Loved the baseball rubber ducky and the jars of sweets. All staff I dealt with were very helpful and accomodating. The coffee and biscuits a welcome treat after a long day. The free PC/Internet access at the main desk was an added and very welcome bonus for an international traveller.Location is excellent. If you stay in SF for a few days, check out the MUNI pass. Saved lots of money using it on cable cars and street cars.Had a great stay in SF and the Chancellor was the cherry on top.

<Content>Excellent value, but not luxury Good value ($112 inc tax), excellent location, good room and facilities (though we seriously missed tea/coffee facilities in the room - free but downstairs is not the same!), bathroom a little small and tired. Though we knew it was non-smoking when we booked, the lack of any balcony etc meant having to leave the hotel for a smoke - be warned if you are a smoker! Breakfast downstairs was good value.Only real moan was about the beggars/trash searchers around Union Square - not the hotel's fault, but not not expected an upmarket location in the grand old US of A (especially after 7 weeks in Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia where we saw no beggars at all).

<Content>A great place to stay in San Fran I was responsible for finding accommodation for myself and 5 colleagues and breathed a sigh of relief as the Chancellor hotel was ideal. It is in a great location, and I found the following particularly good: friendly and helpful staff, access to pc and internet at the reception (at no charge), tea, coffee and biscuits available at any time of the day/night (again, no charge), spacious room with a safe, iron and umbrella  the best thing - massive bath! This hotel is not a luxurious 5 star hotel but it's friendly, clean and central 鈥?and I think for all those reasons it鈥檚 reasonably priced. My colleagues and I were more than comfortable and really enjoyed our stay. I would definitely use it again.

<Content>Fantastic!!!! We stayed at the Chancellor for 5 nights from April 27-May2 and had a fantastic time.The hotel is situated just off Union Square and is a 5-10 min walk from the Powell bart station(20min ride to airport). It has a central location for all of SF.We were on the top floor and overlooked Union Sq and had views to the water.Check in was quick and efficient. The room was of a good size and there was a complimentry bottle of wine and a nice photo frame for us. It was clean and the bed was very comfy. Shower was good and toilets and towels were also spotless..The room also had a free of charge safe deposit box in it.We didnt eat in the hotel at breakfast as everyone seemed to reccomend Sear fine food nexy door and after going there i can see why!!.I would advise to Contact the Chancellor General manager Wes Tyler first to see what deal he can give you, thats what we did and it was cheaper than the websites.I would reccommend this hotel and when we go back to San Francisco we will definatley stay there again!!

<Content>Chacellor Hotel My daughter and I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for six nights and it was perfect. Our room had ample space for two women with lots of luggage. The walk-in closet kept the room very tidy and had plenty of room for storage of our luggage. The single feather beds were verycomfortable. I especially like that the blanket was wrapped with two sheets. Not all hotels have caught on to this idea yet but the Chancellor has. There is also a down duvet on top of each bed. The room was cleaned daily. Coffee and tea are available all day in the lobby. I took traveling mugs and my own tea bags with me so just went downstairs and filled them up with hotwater and was set to start my day. (Americans aren't known for tea so I always travel with my own) The front desk staff were very helpful with giving directions. The Chancellor is in a perfect location for city transit.The Street car stops right outside the door. Market street is a shortdownhill walk from the hotel where all of the other buses we needed were. We never got lost!! We booked all of our tours on-line from home or from the computer available in the front lobby. The internet was always available to us when we needed it. We did purchase a Muni 7 day pass in the hotel lobby. My daughter had hers pickpocketed from her on our first day in the city. So please be careful. The passwas the same price at the hotel as it is at the terminals. The woman that works at the information booth in the lobby is very cute and warned us about where to be especially careful in the city when it comes to pick pockets. We did pay a premium price for the room but went at a peak time. The hotel suited our needs and I would recommendit especially due to the location. On our last night we treated ourselves to spa treatments right next door at the Lux Salon. Very reasonable prices and delightful employees.

<Content>Good location, Good price Stayed at this hotel in April 2007. Fantastic location, walking distance to all the shops  China town. 5 minute walk to Market Street which is where you get the trams  tube. 10 minutes on a tram to Pier 33/39 which is where the Alcatraz  Golden Gate Bridge Tours start from. Hotel reception really nice, staff friendly  helpful. They have free tea  coffee in the lobby. The bedroom was nice though on the small side but that may be because we didn't arrive till 1am  it was their last room! We were happy all round.

<Content>THE CHANCELLOR IS AN EXCELLENT VALUE--CAN'T BE BEAT  We stayed at the Chancellor last week for four nights. The hotel was everything I expected it to be. We were fortunate enough to get a model room on the 10th floor. Yes, the rooms are small, but this room was very cozy, with a big walk-in closet and a great bathtub. The bed was to die for. I've had a two-level spinal fusion so a comfortable bed is a crucial thing for me. This bed was the best hotel bed I've ever slept in, even considering high end hotels. It was soft, but not too squishy. Nice linens too. Again, keep in mind this was a model room. Room 1000 to be exact. Great staff, good breakfast, nice little bar. Great rate of $109 per night. We did not hear a thing thru the walls in our room. And yes, you can hear the street noise, but we enjoyed the ambient noise of the clang clang clang goes the trolley, ring ring ring goes the bell. After all, you won't hear that noise in any other city in the world. Wes Tyler the General Manager was a pleasure to deal with. We are recommending the Chancellor to everyone we know.It's a great value. Don't miss it if in San Fran!

<Content>Great honeymoon! Stayed for four night at the Chancellor after reading all the wonderful reviews on this forum. It was great! I requested for a newer room as it was our honeymoon, and we got room 1003. We had a bottle of champagne and a jr of sweets upon our arrival. I think this equates to service any 5 star hotel gives. In fact, maybe even more! Unless you are staying in the honeymoon or presidentail suite, how many other hotels give complimentary champagne? Beautiful room. Good size. Comfy bed. Loved their pillow menu! The bathroom was a bit small, but really really spotlessly clean. Never got to try their tub though.All the extra touches makes this hotel really special, eg the pillow menu which I had mentioned, the rubber duckie. Was a little disappointed that we were not told there was complimentaty choc chip cookies and apples and popcorn at the lobby. Guess we should have kept our eyes open. Didn't realise it until the last few moments when we were waiting for our shuttle in the lobby. Would have been nice if the front desk mentioned it to us upon our check in. Would have made our stay a lot more fun - to come back to this wonderful hotel and grab a cookie on the way up to our room :)But nevertheless, great hotel with a more-than-fair price. The so-called noise din't bother us at all. Why would anyone complain about falling asleep to the bells of the cable cars?

<Content>Loved this hotel I just returned from my first trip to San Francisco this past week. I just want to say that my stay at the Chancellor was the best. I booked my room thru Expedia and got a fantastic rate. As a single woman traveling alone it is very important to me to be located in a central area and also feel safe and secure. After doing research on the internet I felt like the Chancellor was the hotel for me. The location is the best - right on the cable car line and right in the middle of great shopping and restaurants. Yes, the rooms are on the small size but I didn't come to San Francisco to stay iin my room. I was usually out and on the go by 8:00 each morning and did't get back to late in the evening. I did not have any trouble with the walls being too thin. The beds were very comfortable and the large bathtub was great. I did not eat in the hotel restaurant but did enjoy the cookies and coffee in the lobby. Everytime I had a question about the city I found the front desk to be very courteous and helpful. I had a wonderful time in SF and if I go there again, I will stay at the Chancellor without a doubt.

<Content>Enjoying the Chancellor as I write this I am staying at the hotel right now and I must say everything is right on as far as the reviews. The location can't be beat and so far the staff has been very nice. I told them it was my anniversary and in my room waiting for us was a nice bottle of wine with a note congratulating us on our anniversary. Yes the rooms are small but it adds a certain charm you don't get at your typical cookie cutter hotels. For those of you looking to stay at a nice clean hotel at a fair price in an incredible location, then the Chancellor is the perfect choice.

<Content>Great value, excellent service We stayed for 5 days at the Chancellor and had a great time. Rooms aren't very big, and there is no air conditioning, but you don't really need that with the mild weather in SF, plus each room had a ceiling fan.This is an older hotel, yet it has some charm and everything is reasonably updated. The staff at the hotel was wonderful. Since we were staying for a while, we asked to be moved to a room with a better view. The staff was right on top of it the next morning, and personally escorted us to a nicer room. They couldn't have been more helpful. Location is excellent. Right on a trolley line and can walk to almost everything. Each room had a iron  board as well.Street noise was a little much even on the 14th floor. Late at night you could hear someone playing old classics on a sax somewhere.. part of the SF experience.. sighAll in all, for what we paid ($136/night) it was a great value and great experience. Be sure to check out their website directly for specials. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Great value and a great hotel We returned to the Chancellor at the end of our touring holiday in California because we liked it so much, and it was very good value at such a great location (Union Square).We had booked a special package (Romance on the Square) with champagne, chocolates and an 11th floor room overlooking the square. The price included free cable car tickets and huge breakfasts There was unlimited free cofffe, tea and biscuits also free email access. When we returned, they gave us a suite on the top (15th) floor with a four-poster bed and 2 TVs  bathrooms.The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly, and the rooms were beautifully decorated.The location was perfect for sightseeing, shopping and for getting to  from the airport by BART train- an airport shuttle bus is also available.Stay there - you'll be glad you did!

<Content>Thouroughly enjoyed our stay We stayed 5 days at the Chancellor after arriving at the Oakland airport at 11:00pm at night. Due to the late arrival and that we were travelling with an 18month old, we took a taxi straight to the hotel, which was probably the best option at that time. The taxi didn't have a car seat and we didn't travel with one, but it is up to the parent to choose to travel as such on vehicles like buses/trolleys/taxis. The taxi was a small SUV style and the driver was conscientious. The hotel staff was always professional and helpful. They were able to accomodate a small fridge for our son's food/milk even at the late hour of arrival (12:30am). We only ate at the hotel restaurant one morning but the food was good and the staff was very nice. Susan at the tour desk was always helpful with info and booked a Muir woods/Sausolito tour for us along with a rental car reservation for later in the week. The hotel location was excellent with the trolley being right outside. The rental car facility was about 3 blocks away. They picked us up at the hotel, but we returned from Napa Valley late, so I parked it in the garage above the rental facilty and walked back over in the morning to return the car. We enjoyed San Francisco very much. I recommend if you do the Muir/Sausolito tour and want to stay longer in Sausolito, just stay and take the ferry back to San Fran. In addition, we toured Napa and Sonoma and afterward drove straight west and came down the coast. This added a few hours to our return time, but if your not prone to car sickness it is definitely worth it. On our last day, we had a midnight flight out, so we left our luggage with the front desk for our last day of sightseeing. On our return to the hotel, we decided to take the BART to Oakland Airport even with our little one and 4 pieces of luggage. Matt at the front desk took the extra time to help us with our luggage to the station, which was a huge help, and we had a nice inexpensive trip to the airport on the BART and Air BART.We would definitely stay at the Chancellor again.

Yes, the rooms are compact but they are clean and have everything you need for a city stay.The staff are friendly and accommodating and the rooms were serviced daily at times convenient to us.The complimentary coffee, biscuits and popcorn were a very nice touch. there is nothing like a cup of coffee, a biscuit and an oversized sofa in reception for people watching after a day sightseeing.We would certainly stay there again if visiting the city.

<Content>great location great staff ! What a nice place to stay! Allthough the rooms were small and the bathroom very small I liked the Chancellor. Its location can't be beet its great. This hotel is on Union Square were all of the best in shopping and eating can be found. The area is fantastic! The Chancellor was built in 1914 according to the staff and some old photos in the lobby. Because of its age the rooms are small but nice.Very clean, I read some reviews and noticed nothing but clean sheets and towls. Some of the furnshings could be updated but its not bad. I went for just one night but checked in early and checked out late the next day. The staff from the front desk to the toure desk to the restaurant were of a high standard. They were so nice and helpful. Our room faced the back and only had a view of tops of buildings but it was very quite. I read some say the walls were thin but I did not notice any noise from either side both rooms were in use. This place has lots of old California charm and a nice confortable lobby. I got a very good deal for $75.00 . I will stay here again if possible.

<Content>Iffy.... Well, I am not sure if I really liked or did not like this hotel. There were good things and bad things..GoodLocation is great! We were close to so many great things and the trolley stop in right out front. Staff- they were nice. Bathrooms were very clean!Bad-Paper thin walls. I heard everything my neighbor said. It was awful.Bed- hard as rock. I actually woke up with a backache.Overall impression of the hotel could be better. The rooms are very very tiny and they def need to redo the hotel. The decorations, carpet and bedspreads are old and shabby. Carpet looks dirty. If you are sharing a room with someone you do not know, get TWO rooms. I felt like I was back in college in my dorm room...Ask for a room in the back of the hotel or high up. You can hear everything on the street... If you are looking for a hotel that is inexpensive, close to the sights and just want to drop your stuff off and go- this is the place. Just bring earpplugs and expect to feel very close to the person you are sharing a room with.

<Content>Chancellor blows the chance to impress!! This hotel definitely caters to those who don鈥檛 care about their accommodations but simply need a place to drop off their luggage. The great location and quaint motif are sadly offset by the paper thin walls surrounding a sardine-small room and a lack of customer service. My wife and I decided to go to San Francisco for our five year anniversary. On our first night we were unable to sleep due to the rice paper thin walls. We were able to hear the neighbors鈥?television and the details of their conversation. A majority of the staff do not speak English but when you鈥檙e lucky to find someone who does they have no desire to help you. I asked for information and assistance to book a show. They simply gave me a couple of numbers and told me to help myself. On our second night my wife woke up at around midnight parched from the hustle and bustle of the day. I called the front desk to purchasesome bottled water. To my dismay they told me they don鈥檛 offer that since they don鈥檛 have room service. The restaurant and convenience store were both closed. I asked if there was a vending machine nearbyand they replied that there were none on the premises. They directed me to go to a drugstore and begrudgingly I went in the middle of the night in my pajamas and a jacket I regretted doing so immediately when I was accosted by a vagrant asking for asking for money. He was relentless and wouldn鈥檛 leave me alone. Needless to say this will be our last stay at Chancellor Hotel on Union Square.

<Content>Charming Chancellor Hotel My husband and I just spent 4 nigths at the Chancellor Hotel on Union Square and absolutely LOVED it! The hotel was clean and charming with coffee, tea, cookies and fruit available in the lobby 24 hours a day. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location... perfect! All lines of public transportation are readily accessible. Dim Sum in Chinatown is within walking distance as is GREAT shopping! On Thursday and Friday artists filled the square with their wares. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the Chancellor... it is the ideal spot for a couple's getaway!I would recommend getting a MUNI pass. We made our money back in one day and the passes were good for three days. Also highly recommend Sears restaurant next door for a hearty breakfast that will last you through dinner!

<Content>Enjoyed Our Stay On a college visit to the Bay Area we stayed at the Chancellor for an evening after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews had been overwhelmingly favorable, and we agree. The desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly, while the room was pleasant and cozy (small), which was absolutely fine, as our primary criteria for selecting the Chancellor were price and location, and on those counts we could not be more pleased. The pluses have been noted, while a minus would be the rather thin walls, so hope for quiet neighbors. Great restaurant (Sears) next door.

<Content>great location, great price, but thin walls the chancellor hotel is in an ideal location! cool old building. right across from union square, right on the cable car line, bus stops are a block over. plus there is a borders bookstore right next door and sears fine dining on the other side, which by the way, has a great breakfast! the sweet lady at the hotel's mini convenience store was very helpful and found us a nice tour.our room was small, bathroom super small, but we only paid $111/nt which included valet parking. so we got what we paid for. it was clean but things were old. there were black stains on our towels, but they happily gave us new ones. our only issue really was how thin the walls were. we stayed 3 nights and thankfully we had different neighbors each night. the first and last were tolerable. the 2nd night though, was maddening! there was one lady, who sounded like 20! she wouldn't stop talking on the phone until after midnight! we know all about her special diet, her kids, etc... anyways, we didn't get much sleep because she was at it again early in the morning. we were going to change rooms if it happened the next night but luckily, the next guy was much quieter. it's hard to blame the hotel for being next to a loud mouth, but really the walls were pretty thin!we would stay there again, but would pay more for a nicer room.

<Content>Perfect Stay We stayed for two nights at the Chancellor and couldn't have been more pleased with the location, the rooms and the price. It's in a central location -- right in the middle of Union Square which has lots of great shopping. It is next door to Sears Fine Food and across the street from Saks Fifth Avenue. We easily walked to China Town, North Beach, Ferry Plaza Farmers Market and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Although small, the rooms were spotless and quiet (we requested rooms in the back). The price was excellent -- we will definitely stay there on next trip to SF. Don't miss Dottie's True Blue Cafe for breakfast -- it's awesome!

<Content>Hygiene problem The hotel is conveniently located in downtown SF and it would be a good value if not one problem. On the arrival I found that bed sheets in my room were quite worn out and had black spots on them. I asked to replace them and it was done. There were no spots anymore but several thick black hairs on my pillow and sheets. Disgusting!!! The hotel changes sheets daily and a few times the sheets were good and other times they were worn out and/or had hair on them. No problems with towels.

<Content>great location We think the Chancellor Hotel is great value for money in an unbeatable location. The rooms were clean and although other reviews complain that the rooms are too small - we had four large suitcases and found the size of the room perfectly acceptable. The lady who gave tourist in formation in the lobby of the Chancellor spoke poor English and wasn't very friendly or informative although the reception staff were friendly and helpful. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would definitely stay there again next time we visit San Francisco.

And, we are extremely happy that we did it. First, the location of the hotel is as good as it gets. There is a shuttle bus running around the clock door-to-door from the airport to the hotel. The cable cars run right outside of the hotel, so we could hop on one randomly as we walk. Although we were strangers to the city, we found it absolutely painless to do our visits using public transportations because everything is nearby. We took BART to Berkeley and used MUNI around the city. We also found ourselves right in the center of a shopping and restaurant haven. We were able to find vegetarian or vegetarian-friendly places with fabulous food (such as Asia SF, Golden Era, both of which are highly ranked on TripAdvisor) all within walking distance. And, we were thrilled to find that even China Town was only 3 blocks away. We made a pretty aggressive to-do list for the trip, and we were surprisingly happy to see that we got to do them all, because we didn't lose any time on transportation. Second, like a lot of others said, although the room is small, it is clean, lovely, and extremely quiet. At the end of the day, nothing beats a peaceful good sleep. Overall, we feel it's really worth every penny we paid, and we definitely will book it again when we visit San Francisco again

<Content>The Chancellor is GRRRRREAAAAAAAAAATTTTT!!!! Where do I start???? I decided to stay in San Fran for a weekend onmy way to Fresno. This was my 1st time there, and I am a 30 something single woman, from Atlanta so i was looking to just 'do me'. I had called ahead and asked Wes (The General Manager) to hook me up with a room next to someone cute (lol). He told me he wasnt sure if he could guarantee that, but would make sure I had a nice room. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by the nicest doorman-Matt.....he helped with my belongings up to my room. When i got to my room, I was greeted with a very nice smell of strawberries and fruit. Fabulous air freshner!!!! I also had a nice designer bottle of water, a picture frame and a note from Wes! He put me in one of their 'model' rooms and it was very nice! Just right for a single person, or a couple. The bed was very cozy!!!! I had no problem with noise or anything!!!! The staff was nice and I recommend this place to any single traveler or a couple that wants a cozy getaway! Also visit the Starlight Room right across the street. Sunday it was 80's nite. Lots of fun!!!! Close to everything!!!!!! Thumbs up to Wes!!!! And the Chancellor Hotel!!!

<Content>Perfect hotel for us!! I would highly recommend this hotel. As a first time traveler to San Francisco this hotel could not of been in a more perfect spot! It was wonderful to catch the trolley right outside the hotel, and be able to hit all of the tourist attractions! Yes the rooms are small, but very neat, and clean. Plus there is so much to do and see in San Francisco that you dont spend a whole lot of time in the room anyway! The staff were extremely helpful, and courteous. When we arrived they noticed that our reservations were made for twin beds, and offered to switch my husband and I to a queen room, without us even asking. We wouldnt think of staying anywhere else but the Chancellor, you cant beat the price, especially for the location!! Thanks for wonderful experience.

<Content>Great overall value! What a great value in a great location! I thoroughly enjoyed my one-night stay. Easy to get in and out of this hotel. Staff was very available and knowledgeable. I found everything very convenient about this hotel. Attractive interior. Seemed less crowded than other hotels in the area. Rooms are a bit small but cozy and just right for a short stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Just a smooth, pleasurable experience all around, and the value was great. I hope they continue to do a nice job with what they do!

<Content>Perfect choice!!! This reservation was made by a mom for her daughter who is a senior in college. I wanted a safe, clean place for two 22 year old girls going to the big city for spring break! After much research, the Chancellor Hotel was selected. It was perfect! The girls LOVED the quiet corner room on the 10th floor because of the HUGE closet and comfy beds. They thought it had just been redecorated! The location was primo for their mission of shopping  sightseeing! I wish to thank the GM, Mr. Wes Tyler, for making their stay a little more special, too. They have already decided to make the Chancellor Hotel their home base when they return to San Francisco as will I when I visit San Francisco.

<Content>Excellent example of an intimate small hotel! Having just returned from a seven night stay at The Chancellor I wanted to share my experience with everyone here at Tripadvisor. The Chancellor Hotel was a wonderful find! It exceeded or expectations. It sounds too good to be true...BUT IT'S NOT!!!!The Chancellor has an old world charm unlike the sterile chain hotels. It is charming with an intimate feeling, small enough to feel at home but right in the heart of The City, accessible to everything. The staff was friendly and welcoming, informative and efficient.There are so many touches that make the hotel special. First, and foremost, it is clean and well cared for with much attention to detail. Ammenities such as comfortable beds, a pillow menu,ceiling fans, a walk in-closet with with a safe, a portable heater, iron and ironing board and an umbrella, plus ample room for hanging clothes as well as storing luggage . The bathroom had a soaking tub complete with bath salts and fine toiletries(as well a a rubber ducky!).There were sweets and coffee in the room as well as delicious Italian Roast coffee,cookies and apples in the lobby, along with free newspapers and WIFI computer access. All make it exceptional in my opinion.I had the good fortune of communicating with Wes Tyler, the general manager, on the forum before our trip and he went out of his way to make our stay at The Chancellor VERY special.My biggest disappointment was that we were not able to meet him and thank him personally because he was away during our visit. Perhaps next time! And there WILL be a next time!We may have been spoiled by the suite of rooms we were given on the 15th floor but we found no problem with the size of our accomodations. Given that is an older hotel we expected something smaller. And there wasn't much more you could ask for...all the ammeneties you could ask for were there. And add to all of that LOCATION, LOCATION,LOCATION! Being right on Union Square on The Powell Street Cable Car Line! We had great weather and had the windows open all week and were able to enjoy the sounds of The City that make it so unique. Even the local street musician playing the saxaphone put us to sleep at night.There are so many things to say about San Francisco and The Chancellor in particular I could go on and on but I'll save some of that for other sections of the forum.I do want to mention,however, that if you are staying in The City you will not have to rent a car. Just get a MUNI Passport (1,3 or7 days). It offers you unlimited accessto all Muni transportation ( buses, streetcars,trollies, AND also INCLUDES the Cable Cars!!!! )(Although we are afraid the MUNI might go broke considering we rode EVERYTHING and went EVERYWHERE for our 7 day $24.00 Passport !!!)Kudos to The Chancellor, the staff and especially to Wes Tyler.

<Content>Great Place to stay This hotel is absolutely fantastic because of the combination of price, location and service. The rooms are very nice - clean, comfy and quiet. The staff is very friendly. They have free WiFi connectivity and use of the internet is free. The coffee on the first floor is also very nice. The concierge lady was very helpful (don't forget to tip!).Also, the Sears food place next door is one of the top 10 places to eat in SF - great pancakes!

<Content>Very enjoyable stay We stayed at the Chancellor for 3 nights in January as a stopover from the UK to Australia and chose the hotel from the comments on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed with our choice as the position on Union Square is superb with easy access to all the sights, shops and restaurants. Breakfast in the hotel was very good and next door is Sears famous for their breakfast menu.Although not a modern building everything was very clean and comfortable and the staff very helpful and friendly.Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.

I loved the small touches like the jar of hard candy, the bath salts, the umbrella, the pillow menu. You can't beat the location- just steps from the cable car stop. I highly recommend the Chancellor!

<Content>Truely a home away from home  My husband and I chose this hotel 11/06 for a pre-cruise accomodation since it is only 25 min from the SF airport and 10 min from the cruise port. We also had easy access to Fisherman's Wharf, 10 min from Chinatown and in the heart of downtown SF.Our visit proved to be quite memorable and the hotel exceeded our expectations. We chose to book again 2/07 with our very picky relatives. Initially, we were skeptical since the hotel was an older building, smaller rooms and not a big chain hotel, which they were use to.Again, the hotel met ALL expectations. My relatives commented: this hotel had character and charm, the room size was of little importance since it had the necessities of making it a comfortable stay, the staff was extremely helpful with booking our dinner reservations with a VIP card, booking our SF city tour at a reduced rate and being available when needed.If you want something different than the normal hotel chain room and service....this is the place to stay. YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR HOME AWAY FROM HOME....

<Content>Fantastic We Stayed at The Chancellor from 8th - 13th March. To start with the weather was fantastic, into the 80's every day (which although unusual for the time of year was very welome) The hotel was everything i expected from reading the reviews on trip advisor. The staff were all excellent, friendly and welcoming. THe hotels location is perfect, step right out into the thick of the action.I had contacted the manager Wes Tyler to help me sort out a surprise for my husband, which he did with great ease and very quickly. The feeling you get from the staff is nothing is too much trouble. All the touches already mentioned a million times on trip advisor are true, the free coffee, cookies and computer access, the rooms are comfortable and we had a great view on the 15th floor. I would definately stay again and recommend to anyone who listens.There is a problem with the homeless, but they seem friendly enough and a little bit sad.DON'T walk up Turk st like we did looking for a bus stop - rough area, very scary!!

<Content>Very convienent Stayed with my wife and two teenage kids. Had two adjoining rooms on the 7th floor. Rooms are compact, but staff very friendly. Had two breakfasts in the hotel and were good, but also tried next door up the hill (Sears?) which was also good. Trams outside, Powell St station dowh the road, (BART from SFO easy). Take the tram to the other stop (not bay) and walk along the front to the fort under the GG bridge.Also use the F line trams.Don't be put off by the beggars down the hill from the hotel. It's the only area for this.Go to Alcatraz on the first 9.30 ferry. It's the quietest time.

<Content>As good as the New York Algonquin at a third of the price! We spent three nights at the Chancellor during March break and not only did it meet our expectations but went beyond. Upon arrival in the bright elegant lobby, the very pleasant and efficient check-in clerk welcomed us an assigned us a room on the seventh floor. Unfortunately when we arrived the door was open displaying electrical tools on the floor and cables whichmeant that someone was working on something in the room. We returned to the front desk where apologies flowed from the clerk and a new room was immediately assigned to us at the back of the building (blissfully quiet!) on the 2nd floor. The beds were very comfortable (single twins),l the room small but elegantly furnished and the bathroom also small spotless with a jet-flushtoilet and a shower with superb water pressure. My friend immediately remarked the similarity of the Chancellor to the Algonquin Hotel in New York without the exorbitant cost (our rate was $92.75 a night) or the pretentious attitude. Little luxurytouches abounded such as the free Wi-Fi for your laptop (there is also a terminal in the lobby for guests with a printer that's free to use) the jar of candies on the table, the excellent first rate bathroom toiletries,the safe in the closet,the ceiling fan, pay for play movies that literally were still on at the theatres when we were there(Dreamgirls,Children Of Men..etc), the pillow menu,the free coffee and tea and cookies and muffins (all wonderful if you are not a big breakfast person as we are not first thing in the a.m.) and a choice of free newspapers. All ofthe staff without exception were courteous,professional and knowledgeable.In fact the sign of a good hotel in my estimation, is one where you actually look forward to returning to at day's end earlier rather than later. The little bar in the lobby is a good place for an aperitif before going out for the evening and just as nice for one's morning coffee while poring over that day's paper.The location of the hotel is unbeatable. On Powell Street at Union Square, it is a five minute downhill walk to the Powell St Bart and Muni transit systems and to the terminus of the cable cars that everyone should travel at least once on. As we were there for three days we bought Muni Passports for $18.00 each and good for three days. Seeing that a single ride on a cable caris $5.00, we saved a bundle as we travelled the very user friendly transit system constantly. Also at Union Square is the half-price theatre ticket booth where we got tickets for Beach Blanket Babylon, the hysterically funny musical revue that is an institution in San Francisco. It is not to be missed! Restaurants abound in the area, however a lot of them seemed to be designed for tourists. We avoided them and had some wonderful meals off the beaten path but never more than a ten or twelve minute cable car or bus ride away.May I wholeheartedly suggest the laid back and casual North Beach Lobster Shack (532 Green St) where we had delectable Maine lobsters (two 1  1/4lb lobster dinners for $50.00), the amazing Swan Oyster Depot on Polk and California for lunch (not open for dinner) where the cracked crab, shrimp and oysters are the freshest anywhere and scrumptious (be prepared to line up as it only seats about twenty people at a counter but it is worth every minute of the wait), Brandy Ho's on Columbus for excellent and inexpensive Hunan style chinese cuisine (their dumplings are wonderful!) and The Zuni Cafe(another San Francisco gourmet institution) on Market and Gough for a high end smart casual lunch or dinner. They are famous for chicken for two which is roasted chicken with a bread salad dressing and which is jaw droppingly delectable.. A dinner for two with appetizers, main course and drinksand coffee (no dessert, as we were full) came to under $100.00.. Within an eight minute walk from the hotel, we also discovered a wonderful Indonesian restaurant on Post St, aptly named The Indonesia where everything we had was very delicious.We had a wonderful experience in one of our favorite cities and it was in no small part to the charm and comfort of the Chancellor.

<Content>Great Location Great Value We stayed at this hotel for three nights in March 2007 after reading reviews by others on Trip Advisor. The hotel was really good value and in a superb location just minutes away from Union Square. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was small but decor was good, bed very comfortable and bathroom fine. A 'walk-in' cupboard was useful for stashing cases and had a safe, ironing board and iron and a portable heater for chilly nights. Just a few yards away was Lori's Diner which was fun and inexpensive and the Sears restaurant withthe 'world famous l8 pancake breakfast'! Great shopping in the area and the new mall Westfield had an elegant Nordstrum store with a curving escalator right up to the lounge beneath the dome on the 4th floor with comfy seats for a rest between shopping. For those with less to spend try Ross a few stores along for real bargains - also Kaplans govt. surplus store which sells genuine Levi 501's for $27. Don't miss a short walk to Maiden Lane to see a fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright building, and a walk around Chinatown - choose the 'gift supermarket' to buy your souvenirs at rock bottom prices with nobody hassling you.Keep a few dollars available for the homeless beggars who sell the newsheet on the streets in this area.

<Content>Overrated, but not horrible Stayed in room 1400 (corner room). Really small room. Was able to touch both walls of the bathroom while standing in the middle (I'm only 6' tall). But, no biggie, room was functionable. I consider this place Quaint. Staff was nice - no complaints about them (no kudos either, they didn't go out of their way for us, but they were always nice). Also, the cable car route starts down the street, but there's a line all the time to ride it, so it's no advantage. The Irish bar around the corner (Lefty's I think) is great for breakfast. Also, easy walk to Chinatown and then to Little Italy.I personally think people were rating this hotel so high because they liked the location and also that this hotel is at least $50 cheaper than the nearby chain-brand hotels. Otherwise, I've stayed at Courtyard Marriotts better than this. PS - eat at the Crustacean - best D-crab you will ever eat!

<Content>Highly Recommend the Chancellor Hotel on Union Square!!!! Our stay at the Chancellor Hotel on Union Square was excellent! The staff was friendly and helpful, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location was outstanding as the cable cars ride past the front of the hotel. There are so many nice restaurants and shops near the hotel and the location is extremely safe. We will definitely go back to the Chancellor when we return to San Francisco later this year!

<Content>It was perfect We stayed midweek, one night. When I called, the employee gave us the parking/room pkg for $10 less than the internet price I was calling about. All staff were very friendly; room was very clean and although it's an older hotel, it has modern amenities, including an updated CD/radio with plug for IPOD. If you are a bath person, you will love the deep and long tub. They even provided a package of bath salts! The bathroom was small, but the tub made up for room size and it wasn't so small to make one uncomfortable. We've had much smaller bathrooms in Europe and in BBs. The location was perfect - we never needed our car. By all means, get the parking pkg. The parking garage sign showed $27 for 24 hours parking. We paid $116 (plus tax) for the room, INCLUDING parking. You have to drive your car to the lot yourself and walk back to hotel, but that's ok becuz the garage was a very short walk from the hotel. We will stay there again and were surprised that we could get such a perfect location and more than decent hotel for that price.

<Content>Excellant Location, Excellant VFM - Staff great! Fantastic location - on Powell - so next to the tram, easy to get about - main buses and streetcars at the bottom of the road. Close to the shops and Chinatown. Excellant value for money. Rooms were clean and tidy and had everything you could need - iron, safe, umbrellas, rubber duck - seriously.The only downside - didn't think much of the restaurant - but who eats in a hotel when you are somewhere like SF?!My partner unfortunatly contracted food poisoning (from the restarant opposite, Scala) on the last night - the concierge was fantastic on calling out a doctor etc and were patient whilst I had to run around arranging flights etc and allowed us to stay in the hotel extra late. Unfortunatly the hotel was full so could not stay and extra night, but they arranged a room at the Cartwright round the corner - and the bellboy pushed our stuff up there - so excellant customer service.The Valet parking was cool too (if a little dear - like $50)Check out the Gold Dust lounge for a drink - down the road - the band in there played all the ol' faves and had a nice friendly atmosphere

<Content>Does what is says on the tin We needed a room for the night, in transit from Auckland to London, for the 2 of us and our 18month daughter.We wanted somewhere central  not too expensive.The reviews here were helpful and I emailed their info@ address, but as I didn't get a reply, I emailed Wes directly.He could not have been more helpful  gave us what seemed like a good deal on a 2 room suite.The hotel is just off Union Square, as are a number of more poncey hotels  there are loads of shops, restaurants  diners very close by. As with every US city I've been to, there were a few mildly deranged beggars and god botherers on the street corners, but the immediate locale and Union Square itself felt safe.The lobby is small and pleasant, with a couple of sofas and a free PC terminal for web access in the corner.The luggage gadgee and check-in staff were helpful, as we were too early for our room to be ready.The suite was small, but perfect for our needs - it was on the 14th floor at the back, so relatively quiet. The bedroom had a queen bed, a chair  TV unit. The lounge had a sofa, chair, desk and couple of tables, along with a large TV and a fax machine (!). There were also two bathrooms, one for each room (so the lounge can be used as an extra bedroom with a put-up bed, or cot / crib)There is free wireless access, which was fast and useful.All in all, it's a good solid 3* hotel in a central location and is good value, particularly if Wes gives you a deal. Recommended.

<Content>What a great location and a nice hotel! The hotel exceeded our expectations! We stayed in a room with a beautiful view of Union Square on the 15th floor. We loved being in the middle of the city, the cable cars run right outside of the hotel's front doors and the location could not be better! The hotel is situated right by Union Square, which is central to everything in the city and very easy to get around. We loved all of the shopping that surrounded the hotel, right next door is a Border's which came in handy when I needed to buy a book to read. Overall, the hotel staff was very friendly, free cookies and coffee are definitely a plus! Before we went, I emailed with Wes, the manager, and he was extremely helpful in answering my questions. He told me how to get to the hotel from the airport (take Bart) and we also got a nice surprise when we got to our room! I told him that it was my husband's birthday weekend and also our six months wedding anniversary, so we had a bottle of wine and a picture frame waiting for us in our room with a gorgeous view! We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to all of our friends.

<Content>Chancellor: Amazing Hotel, Beautiful Suite, Perfect Location Finally getting around to posting a review of the Chancellor, a wonderful boutique hotel in San Francisco.A few months back, I started making plans to attend MacWorld San Francisco, which takes place every January. My wife and I had a baby girl last March, and she was 10 months old in January, making it OK for us to take our first baby-free vacation. :) After ensuring that my in-laws would be able to keep her for a few days, we started making plans.MacWorld started on Monday, January 8th, so we made arrangements to fly out there the Friday before (the 5th). My wife would stay through the morning of the 9th and fly home, after which I'd move to the official MacWorld hotel (the Marriott on 4th Street) for the remainder of my stay.But for our time in SF together, we wanted a smaller hotel, a more romantic hotel than the gigantic Marriott. We started looking on TripAdvisor, epinions, and some other places, and found that the Chancellor Hotel got consistently good reviews, and was less expensive than many places in the Union Square area.The one liability of the Chancellor seemed to be that some rooms were noisy, particularly rooms that had a connecting door to the room next door. However, people raved about the staff, particularly Wes Tyler, the general manager, who has a very noticeable presence on TA, responding to people's comments, compliments, and complaints.So, I sent Wes an email, explaining the situation. I told him that this would be our first vacation since the baby was born, and that it was my wife's first trip to San Francisco in nearly 20 years. He responded quickly with an amazing offer -- if I'd book directly with the Chancellor, he'd upgrade us to a top floor suite for the price of a regular room ($125/night). Of course, we took that deal!!!So for two months, we waited for our SF vacation, and January finally came!!! After a moderately-tearful departure from our little girl, we boarded our Southwest flight in Birmingham, changed planes in Las Vegas, and arrived at Oakland International in the late afternoon. After a harrowing shuttle trip (I will never use SuperShuttle again!) we arrived at the Chancellor around dinnertime.The front desk clerk was efficient and polite, and got us checked it quickly. The lobby was understated, clean and pretty. A few comfy chairs in the front near the windows, with the bar and lounge at the back of the lobby, next to to the elevators. We boarded the elevators and headed up to the 14th floor to see our room.It was, in a word, gorgeous!!! What they've done for these top floor suites (I believe there are 4 total) is to combine two regular rooms into a suite. So we entered into a living room, with a couch, a comfortable chair, coffee table, small dining table, and TV. There was also a coffee maker and refrigerator.Through the connecting doorway was the bedroom, with a gorgeous four-poster bed, an armoire hiding another TV, and two chairs. There was also a gift package for us, consisting of a bottle of champagne, two Chancellor champagne flutes, and a boxed wooden picture frame with the Chancellor's name on it. Lovely.The view from the room was very nice, overlooking Union Square from above. In the day time, you could also get a glimpse of San Francisco Bay between the skyscrapers.Each half of the suite had its own bathroom, with a large bathtub and Chancellor-labelled rubber ducks. We took one home for our daughter, of course!!!That first night, the temperature had dropped substantially, and the Chancellor's heating system wasn't quite making it toasty on the top floor. A quick call down to the front desk resulted in a small space heater being delivered to our room. (On subsequent nights, the temperature in the room was just fine.)The location of the Chancellor is as perfect as it could be. Right on Powell Street, a half-block from Union Square, directly on the cable car lines. An easy walk to Chinatown, which is what we did for dinner the first night. Also an easy walk to Market Street, and the connections to the BART and SF Muni transit systems.On our last day at the Chancellor, we checked our bags with the bell desk after checking out of the room. My wife did some Union Square shopping while I headed over to MacWorld to check in, and to the Marriott to claim my room there. After an afternoon visit to the Anchor Brewing Company for their tour (highly recommended, if only for the SIX glasses of free beer!) we caught a cab back to the Chancellor to pick up our bags. The staff was again very helpful and assisted us loading our HEAVY bags into the cab.All in all, highly recommended. The Chancellor is a beautiful, charming hotel in the perfect San Francisco location. If you can talk Wes into upgrading you to the suite, so much the better!!!

<Content>Great for what it is If you are looking for a great location, friendly service, and above average accomodations, this is your place. It is located right off Union Square and convenient to everything downtown. The rooms are a little on the small side and a little dated. They are however, comfortable and clean. There are also a few extras, some at a small additional cost, that make things nicer such as foot baths, tempur-pedic type pillow, aroma therapy type items. The beds were comfortable. They have an arrangment with a fitness center a block away that allows you free visits. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. All in all, this was among the best values I've found in many trips to San Francisco. As long as you're not looking for 5-star luxury, I would highly recommend the Chancellor. One last thought, like everywhere in SF, the parking is expensive. Check out some of their package deals that include parking.

<Content>Central Location in San Francisco I stayed through the weekend of 2/3 and this was my first time in San Francisco. The Chancellor Hotel was a great start to a San Francisco visit. The hotel is centrally located: the cable car, streetcars, buses, BART and muni subway are all close by so you can go to any part of San Francisco. It is in the middle of a nice shopping area: Saks, Macy's, Borders, See's Chocolates, Walgreens, Starbucks and great stores and restaurants on Market Street are all nearby or just blocks away. Union Square Park is across the street, so there's a nice place to just sit and catch your breath during the day.The hotel itself is one of the older hotels so it has a lot of character and rooms have high ceilings. Although the hotel is older and rooms are smaller proportioned, the rooms are very prettily decorated and well-maintained and clean. All the staff people were very nice. A lovely touch was that coffee was available to the guests at the hotel at all times of the day. In the morning, the continental breakfast provided coffee, muffins and cookies. This hotel is all non-smoking, which is something that I really appreciated. The area around the hotel is pretty safe for a big city.I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it's a pleasant place to stay, secure, clean, and centrally located.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Amazing Value I stayed at The Chancellor Hotel for 7 days last week and could not have been more satisfied with my stay. The hotel is perfectly situated, well-maintained and very affordable given its superb location. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The extra touches (ex. cookies - those yummy cranberry ones!; rubber ducky in bathroom; pillow menu, etc.) are great too. I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends/colleagues who are planning trips to the Bay Area.

<Content>Okay but could have been better We stayed at the Chancellor in late December including New Years Eve where we anticipated that things would be happening at the Square.However, due to the riots of New Years Eve 2005, the Union Square grassed area was fenced off this year ensuring that everyone would attend the riots down on the foreshore in 2006!The Chancellor is one of those hotels where everything seems okay and pleasant enough but things just do not seem to come together.The room was okay but nothing special. The entrance was functional and check in smooth but nothing special.The biggest plus was that the Cable Car stop was very close and the major shops were reasonably close. There is also a 24 hour pharmacy four doors up. But once again, nothing ignited me about the place.The thing that saddened me most about SFO was the amount of poverty and maybe this jaded me against the Chancellor.I think next time I am in SFO is to head down to the Wharf area. It seemed reasonable alive even at 11am in the morning.

<Content>Perfect for SF getaway We stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for 4 nights and found it to be a great choice for a city break in SF. The room we had was basic but perfectly clean and well-maintained. The free internet access in the foyer was a big advantage! Above all the location was ideal for getting a real flavour of the city, and made it easy to go out in the evenings without worrying about getting taxis etc. The only downside was on the last night we had hired a car, and had some trouble with moving the car to and from the hotel car park. However I think this is more a SF problem, and I wouldn't recommend driving around the hotel area unless you have nerves of steel!

<Content>Excellent Value for Business Traveller An excellent value for what it is - a three star hotel. Though the rooms are a bit small and showing their age and the lobby a bit utilitarian, the Chancellor works hard to provide four/five star amenities in the room (iron, safe) and lobby (cookies, concierge, etc.). Great location. I recommend the hotel room and parking 'bundle' - very convenient. Strictly self-service which I prefer. Check in, check out, delivery of the car all handled perfectly. I probably would not stay there with my family, but I would definitely stay there again on my own.

<Content>Great! I have stayed at the Chancellor on 2 occasions, the last being Feb 2006. I would like to say that I think this hotel is really good. The rooms are kept very clean, nice and bright, beds are comfortable too. This hotel enjoys a great location on Union Square for everything. Very convenient to catch the cable car too. Yes this hotel is old and in my opinion its kept very well by all the staff. The breakfast is excellent in the restaraunt and I can particularly recommend the daily fruit shakes! waiter was also very friendly. There is really only one thing that was slightly annoying.. on my second visit there, after checking in we went to our room and after 45 mins our luggage did not arrive! I called the front desk and was told they were on their way... after a further 30 mins I went down to reception only to find them in the same spot that I left them, right by the front desk so I took them up to the room myself. A minor point I agree, however it was pouring with rain in San Francisco so we were wet and really needed a change of clothes, otherwise I would not have minded this but there was no apology given whatsoever. Besides this, I would have no hesitation in staying here again on my future visits to SFO. Thanks... manager and staff do a great job - keep it up!

<Content>Expect Some Quirks and You'll Be Fine The Chancellor is exactly what I expected based on most of the reviews here--brilliantly located, inexpensive, staffed by nice people and a bit quirky because it is an older structure. Plus it's right around the corner from Dottie's True Blue Cafe, where I had the best breakfast of my life!My room was against a shared wall with the adjacent building, and at about 7 each night, when the tenants on the other side of the wall got home, a stereo went on and played until about 11. It wasn't terribly loud, but I'm super sensitive to noise. I called down to the front desk about changing rooms, but the hotel was fully booked that evening. However, the gentleman at the desk offered to have a white noise machine sent up. That did the trick. The night before my check out, I had a memo slipped under my door indicating that the plumbing would be worked on through the night and the water would be back on early in the morning. When I got up to shower at about 7am, the water pressure was quite low. By the time I checked out at 9am, there were several people in the lobby who were upset because they had no water at all. I was very glad to have gotten my shower in. The desk staff said there'd been some complication with the plumbing work through the night and that they were working to fix it. Bottom line--I would definitely stay here again. The rates and location are staggeringly good. I'll just be ready to go with the quirkly flow of the Chancellor.

<Content>central location i chose this hotel because of the reviews on tripadvisor - and the location was very central - just off union square - a short walk down the hill brought you to the cable car to fishermans wharf, and the shopping mall. the room wasn't as spacious as some other hotels i've stayed in but considering the location you couldn't expect a huge room. it's best to ask for a room facing the back - it doesn't have a view but means you can get some sleep. there's free internet access in the lobby and a small bar- staff were very friendly. on our last day in san francisco we hired a car as we were driving down the coast- i wouldn't recommend attempting to drive in the city - too many one way streets and scary hills.

<Content>Just perfect :) My husband and I loved staying at the Chancellor Hotel when we visited San Francisco for the first time last June. We are planning on going again this year, and plan on staying there again. The service was perfect, and we loved the charm of the building as well as the friendly people who worked there. The selection of pillows was awesome. I also loved the soaking tub, which I used every night after a long day of walking all over the city. The bed was very comfortable, and I thought the size of the room was just fine for two people.

<Content>Great Hotel for the Money We just returned for a long weekend celebrating my wife's birthday in San Francisco. We decided to stay at the Chancellor based on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed.It is true that this is an older property and the rooms are small, but they are spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The rooms have nice touches that you would expect in a more expensive hotels like safes and umbrellas for use if it rains. There is a selection of different kinds of pillows that you can ask for which was nice.The staff was excellent. They were not only willing to help us, they were eager to help us. Even the maintenance man who spotted me looking for the ice machine on our first night stopped what he was doing to show me where it was located.A few weeks before our trip, I emailed Wes Tyler, the General Manager, and told him we were coming for my wife's birthday and asked if we could have a room on one of the upper floors with a view of Union Square. When we arrived, we got not only the room we wanted, but it had a bottle of complementary champagne and a birthday greeting for my wife. We certainly did not expect that. This is a great small hotel. We will be back.

<Content>Wonderful Boutique Hotel I had the pleasue of staying at the Chancellor Hotel for 2 days during the Macworld Conference this year. It was my first time to stay here, but certainly not the last. I booked a quiet room on a higher floor, and they delivered. I didn't come to San Francisco for a view -- I came to see the city up front and personal, so having a big, fancy room with a city view was not important to me. I found the room (906) clean, well-stocked and comfortable. The walk-in closet with safe worked perfectly to secure my belongings while at the conference. An extra blanket and pillows were available in the closet, and many other choices of pillows and spa items are available from the front desk just for the asking.The front desk personnel were very accomodating, allowing my brother and I to print out our boarding passes from the provided computer and free internet service. Coffee, tea and free cookies were also available at the desk -- no need for a coffee maker in the room.The charm of this hotel is unbeatable. If you want something modern with extra large rooms and frills, this is not your place. Please, Mr. Tyler, keep the charm and uniqueness of this hotel in mind with your remodel; I like it just the way it is. Complainers can go elsewhere!

<Content>A hotel that makes the most of itself A short note to add to the yes votes for this hotel. You simply cannot beat the location -- or the price. The staff were professional, knowledgable and courteous. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Your laptop won't connect with the wi-fi in the rooms? See the front desk, they'll give you an ethernet cable and you can log on sitting at one of several tables in the lobby area. Want some coffee or a cookie after a long day in SF? Help yourself to both in the lobby, compliments of the hotel.There are any number of hotels that are grander and more luxurious (and I've been to many of both), but when it comes to the quality/price ratio and management that has figured out how to make the best of itself, this hotel ranks right up there.

<Content>What's to say that hasn't already been said? Stayed at the hotel for 6 nights to attend Macworld 2007 with my wife. Got a package deal through Expedia and saved about the cost of one night's stay. The GM seemed quite responsive to questions and requests, so I thought I would drop him an email and find out for myself. I received a prompt response and got exactly what i requested (high floor room with a bit of a view, and breakfast recommendations).So many people have already said great things about this hotel, so I'll probably repeat a few here. This is what stood out for the hotel in my mind -- some stuff might seem minor to most, but it's little things we sometimes take for granted:-- Polite, attentive staff: Everyone always said 'hello'.-- Elevators: My wife doesn't like elevators that feel cramped and old. These ones got my wife's approval. And not only that, they were fast, and there were two.-- TV: Reception was perfect, and included HBO. The last two hotels we stayed at had issues, and it's always nice to watch a little television after a long day on your feet.-- Free coffee in the lobby: not only free, but always hot! I've stayed at hotels that offer free coffee, but don't keep it very warm after hours. -- Free newspaper: always a nice touch.-- Location: Maybe the most ideal location in Union Square if you really want to be picky: For example -- 12 minutes by foot to Moscone, 15 minutes by foot to House of Nanking in Chinatown, and neither involve a big uphill walk!If anyone is interested, our room (1403) was relatively quiet (the only thing you ever heard was the fire truck or police sirens), very spacious (for a boutique hotel), and had an OK view of the Square.What has been a bit of a tradition with my reviews is some tips that I could share that may help some fellow travellers:- Lori's Diner: Nothing special, but the food is priced well, especially since their website has a 20% off coupon. Google it and print a few for your trip.- Sushi joint: my favorite is Sanraku on Sutter. Sit at the bar, chat with the chefs, and watch'em work!- Chinese food: House of Nanking on Kearny. They rush the patrons a bit, but so what? The food is great and two people can leave with full tummies for $20.- Pub crawls: Thirsty Bear and 21st Ammendment are quite good. Try the watermelon wheat beer at the '21A'. The 21A is a bit of a walk from Union Square, but it is doable. Google for them both to check out the menus and exact locations.- Out-of-town excursions: If you are an Apple-fan, head south to Cupertino to see the Apple Campus. If not, head south to Palo Alto and have lunch at Stanford University. Free shuttle around the campus. We ate at Ciao! in the Terman Engineering Complex. Good food for a great price.Enjoy your stay at San Francisco!

<Content>happy and satisfied I booked the evening for my girlfriend and I to stay on a wednesday night in the city. She arrived earlier and had no problems checking in. The location was great, right across the street from the Sir Francis Drake Hotel. The booking staff was efficient. The concierge wasn't too helpful, and looked at me funny when I asked if anything 'special' was going on in the city during the evening. Our room was reasonably sized for san francisco. It was on the fourth floor and we used both the elevator and the stairs. I requested a quiet room which was an option on the hotel website. We didn't have any problems with noise. The bed, TV, bathroom were all fine.There were a bunch of coupons in our room for discounts at retailers and also for discounts at the hotel bar. So, we went down to the hotel bar and had a couple of drinks, which were good. We went over to the Starlight Room on top of the Sir Francis Drake hotel during the evening, which was fun.On the whole, it was a pleasant experience and a great location to hang out from. I can imagine a better hotel experience, but I'm not sure I'd risk a worse one by straying from this hotel the next time we go to to the city.

We can wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviews. The location is fantastic, the hotel and staff great and it is a great base to explore San Francisco. It is a refreshing change to find a hotel at a reasonable price in the centre of a city. We will definitely stay here again when we are next in S.F.

<Content>Fun, Full and Friendly Sorry for the late review. Stayed here in Jun 2006 as on a whilwind trip of some states from the UK.Loved the Chancellor Hotel. Found the rooms to be clean, comfortable and tidy. The bathroom was fine with plenty of hot water etc.The staff at the front desk were very helpful. They let me use the internet to check my mail from home, advised us on how to get the best from the transport system and went through maps so that we knew where we were going.All in all, great value for money, centrally placed and easy to find. Just what us foreigners need after a few beers late at night.Wes - Like the fact that you have the front to answer criticism good and bad. It is a shame that other GM's don't use your example. That was one of the reasons that we chose the hotel via trip advisor. Keep up the good work.

<Content>damp and cold A few problems:1) When booking, we reserved room with two queen beds. Instead, we were told when we arrived there were only twin beds. We had three guests in our room, so one had to sleep in a cot.2) The room is very small, very cold, and damp. When we complained about the condition of the room, we were told that there was no heat available for this room, and basically just to stick it out.3) I became ill halfway through my stay. When I called down to room service to order tea, there was no response. I tried twice more before calling the front desk. No response from the front desk. I tried once more. No response.4) I walked downstairs, saw a note at the bar that said No room service or bar service, as staff is at a holiday party. Okay, understandable. I walked over to the front desk, where not one, but TWO women were standing chatting. I mentioned I called and that I would appreciate a pot to take some of the hot water available in the lobby up to my room. They said the kitchen was closed and they couldn't get anything for me. I walked up the block to Walgreen's.5) Overall, the service offered at this hotel is minimal. No concierge, no bellhop, no doorman. I couldn't even catch a taxi out in front. I walked to another hotel to do so.I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>What a deal! We went to SF to attend a wedding reception at the Sir Francis Drake, which is directly across the street. You can't beat the location which is half a block away from Union square and opposite Neiman Marcus. The walls were a little thin, but it wasn't an issue at all - and I am a VERY light sleeper. The Chancellor is apparently one of the only older hotels in this vicinity that has switched out the windows, therefore minimizing the outside noise. Friends who stayed at the Drake were not happy with the price, accomodations or the noise, although the wedding reception and food was incredible. The only downside I observed was that there was not an A/C in our room, which typically is not a problem in SF, but might be in the summer months. Other than that, this was a clean, small room that was a fantastic find for under $140.

<Content>great, with one negative The only negative I have about this hotel is that the walls are VERY thin and I could hear both couples in the rooms next to ours. I mean, I was following conversations. There is not much the hotel can do about this but I concluded that we'd stay at this hotel again on a weeknight b/c our weeknight stays were with travellers who were a little more quiet than the weekend occupants. Things I LOVED about this hotel: This place has TONS of personality. It's a place you will remember out of any other normal hotel. The rooms were comfy. Wi-fi was a plus. No fridge in rooms, but that's ok.I loved the complimentary tea/coffee and cookies. The location was perfect. Staff was very friendly and helpful.Our stay was great, minus the loud neighbors/thin walls.One little tip: if you take a right outside the door, and then a right at the corner and walk up a minute or two there is a great coffee shop with the best fresh-squeezed oj you'll ever have!

<Content>Fantastic Value Stayed at the Chancellor for 3 nights in late November with my wife and 6 month old daughter. We could not have asked for a better experience. Everyone from the desk staff to the bellmen to the housekeeping staff were courteous, efficient and eager to please. When we called down to request the crib we had reserved for our daughter, it arrived at our door within minutes.As for the hotel itself, the lobby areas are very well maintained and the room was spotless. And, while not enormous, the room was certainly more spacious than anything you could get in New York for three times the price. Make no mistake - this is not the Four Seasons, nor does it claim to be. What it is is a very clean, friendly hotel in one of the best locations in the city. If you're looking for snob appeal, keep looking. While I didn't get a chance to meet Wes in person, my compliments to him for running such a tight ship. Next time we are back in town, we will certainly be back as the Chancellor is, in my mind, one of the best values in hotel accomodation that I've encountered.

<Content>Great Location for the Buck We stayed for 4 night Dec.6th-10th. The hotel was exactly what I expected from the reviews. The rooms are on the small size, but adequate. The location is awesome. When people say If location is what is important--Well when you travel, I think location is the most important, especially in a city.Our check-in went without a hitch, and we didn't ever find that we waited very long for a elevator, as some reported. My wife was cold one night, and since the hotel works on a boiler system and the temp. wasn't low enough for it to go on--a simple call to the front desk and they sent up a portable heater.The only negative was that the walls are very thin when you have an ajoining room. The first night the people in the adjoining room had a baby that started crying at 4 a.m and didn't stop. Was up the rest of the night. They folks at the front desk offered to change our room until they realized that the folks with the baby checked out.We had our children join us for one night on Sat. The Chacellor doesn't normally accept one night reservations for a weekend, but Will was nice enough to accomodate us with another room since we were already booked for 4 nites.All in all, you cannot beat the value of this property. Great location and very pleasant staff.

<Content>Paying for Location I stopped over at the Chancellor hotel for 5 days in November with my boyfriend and overall sadly we were left disappointed by our stay.My main criticism of this hotel relates to the poor quality of the rooms. The decor and standard of my room (and others that I saw when the maid was in!) were shabby and in need of repair, rather than charming or full of character. I may sound it, but am definitely not an overly fussy guest (!) having generally enjoyed my stays at different types of small/large/cheap/expensive hotels and accommodation, all over the world.Reading some of the other reviews, to ensure that you enjoy your stay, I recommend emailing Wes the General Manager beforehand so that he will juggle things in your favour.If you are not overly concerned by the standard of the rooms and location is everything to you, then this hotel is definitely for you. I think this hotel relies too heavily on its location in San Fran (and friendly lady selling refreshments in the lobby!) and should really consider investing in a significant makeover to the benefit of all its guests..

<Content>Location, Location.... This hotel has an awesome location. Just came back Dec 9th after a three day stay. Only used the rental car once - walked or cable car everywhere. Hotel was neat and clean - staff courteous - But the room - oh so small. We had just been in a large room in LA and it was a disappointment. No in room coffee!! What a shock! PJs to the lobby. No fridge! Warm beer! And no view for those in rooms at the back - request one with a view - But the location made up for some of the inconvenience -

When we got to the hotel on Friday, each of us received a tote bag filled with goodies such as discount coupons at the stores near by, picture frame, and discount coupon at the hotel bar. We were very delighted with the personalized touch. It is an older hotel. So we knew that rooms were not going to be spacious and fixtures were not going to be new. But they were clean and comfortable. You can not ask for better location. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very good. The staff was always very courteous and professional.

<Content>disappointment This was our second stay at the Chancellor . Our first visit having been enjoyable we opted for the Chancellor again. This time rooms were shabby with a feature of one being taped down flooring. Service was poor.with reception staff given to sharing private jokes while attending to guests.We were eventually given rooms of a slightly better standard and went on to enjoy the Chancellor's best feature...its location. It is unbeatable. Not included in my criticism of staff is the lady in the foyer kiosk. Want to know anything about San Francisco ? Just ask. ...and the maintainance man who told us all about the history of the hotel and in particular the old cocktail bar .He also showed us round it .

<Content>Wonderful Stay We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Chancellor from Nov 9-12, 2006. I found a great 3 day rate on the website. After I booked, I emailed Wes, the manager, to ask for a quiet room on a high floor..and he delivered. Although it was right next to the elevator, we had no problem with any noise, other than from the street. It was kind of nice to hear the cable car go by. On the second night, I realized that I could get a white noise machine and I loved it!!We were traveling with a service animal and when I told Wes about it, he made sure that we had a brand new bowl set in the room for him!! It was a nice treat. All of the front desk staff were very attentive and asked daily if we were doing OK and needed anything to make our (or the dog's) stay more comfortable. We did not get to eat in the restaurant, or the one next door (Sears) but there were lines out the door every morning. The location can't be beat . Room was small but we were hardly ever there, so it really did not matter much.. I loved the TUB.We will hopefully be back. I guess my one recommendation would be to someday replace the carpeting. In some places it was starting to bubble. All in all, we had a great trip.

<Content>A Hidden Treasure I booked a one night stay here on Nov. 21. I was in much need of some R  R. My job is stressful (I'm a teacher), and my family can be stressful too. So I ran away for a day before Thanksgiving. Once you step through the glass doors, you are transported to another era. The front desk woman was very friendly, as was the bell person (at check-in and out). I recommend the parking valet because it's much easier. I had called a couple days before to request a room away from the elevators. I was given a nice room in the back on the 12th floor. It was a good size and comfortable. I kept forgetting to step up into the bathroom and I thought it was a little small. But the shower pressure was great and the tub was deep. If I had time, I would have soaked in the tub.In the morning, there was the basic hum of the city, but nothing major. Maybe on the Powell St. side, it was noisier, but that's the charm of San Francisco. The staff is incredibly nice. It's in a great location and the cookies and coffee in the lobby are an added treat. Also, this was the first hotel that I've been to that offered an umbrella to use in case of rain.I will be staying here again, and again, in the future. I've stayed at several other hotels in the Union Square area, but never walked away thinking I'd return.

<Content>Viva Chancellor! We are from Veracruz, Mexico, and we personally planned our visit to San Francisco, no travel agents in the middle, just the phone and Internet. My husband suggested The Chancellor Hotel as the best option. I wanted to stay at the Best Western Motor Inn Civic Center (cheaper), but after reading some reviews about its sketchy location, we bet for The Chancellor, and everything was absolutely great! (then, we went to Civic Center and, yes, it was sketchy). At first, we were worried for some comments we found here on TriAdvisor, but every single doubt was answered via e-mail by Kevin Vossen, who gave us a special rate of 109 per nignt plus taxes. We also requested for a room with a view, and we got it: 1204. We were there from November 4th to 12th, 2006. Check-in process was made in minutes, and that was something I appreciated, especially after finding out part of our lugagge was missing. Every member of the staff was absolutely nice and helpful, even the Tour Desk lady, who receives some bad reviews from time to time... she even said Nice jacket to my husband, when he was wearing a colorful one ;) (Thank you!) I guess talking about Chancellor's location is not necessary, because everybody knows it's perfect! Cable cars are steps from the door, wonderful stores around, Walgreens (24-hour open) in the corner of the same block, and across the street, Lori's Diner, the most delicious restaurant we have ever found. Decorated in 50's style, fantastic milkshakes, hamburgers... all the menu is perfect, so, don't miss it!San Francisco has a lot to offer... Our top ten (not arranged in a special order): 1.-Golden Gate Bridge (we walked it!), 2.-Japanese Tea Garden (relax!), 3.-Japantown and 4.-Chinatown (very different from each other), 5.-Alcatraz (amazing views), 6.-Lombard Street (so different), 7.-Victorian houses from Alamo Square (you will feel in a movie), 8.-Castro District (the gay and friendly neighborhood), 9.-Haight Ashbury (so hippie... Janis Joplin and Jimmie Hendrix lived there), 10.-Cable Car and Railway museums (we talked to a lady who told us cable cars from Veracruz were in San Francisco in 1982!)... Bonus.-Ghirardelli Square, where you MUST get a brownie! **SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT! Don't rent a car, because you will spend so much money in parking lots. Try to get a 3-day, 5-day or 7-day MUNI pass, which are valid for cable cars, railway and city buses. We got our 7-day passes (for 24 USD each) and they were worthy. Transportation system in San Francisco is great, you will find a big map in every bus stop, so, if you make a mistake (like we did), there's nothing to worry about, you just get off the wrong bus and take the right one just by showing your pass, no extra fare!**Just a suggestion for The Chancellor: check your website, because you can't make a reservation through it. That's what happened to us, so we tryed by e-mail and we got a positive answer from Kevin Vossen.

<Content>Perfect location! Chose to stay here following excellent tripadvisor reviews and am really glad we did!Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 3 nights in nov 06 and absolutely loved it. The location is perfect, we could see the whole of Macy's from our window. It's also on the tram route which we used to go to Alcatraz - tip: book in advance before you get to San Francisco. When we were there the next available tickets were a few days away.The room was a good size and clean with a few lovely touches like the rubber duck in the bathroom. We found the complimentary internet access in the lobby to be very useful. The room also had complimentary wifi access which we didn't use but were quite impressed by.The reception desk staff were most helpful. Even allowed us to make a call from the desk when we were having trouble getting through to a number.The only downside was that the walls were a little thin and we could hear next door's television quite clearly although we did have an adjoining door to that room which might have been the cause. If we ever visit San Francisco again, we will definitely be staying here.

<Content>We had a Wonderful Time ! My husband and I booked a week in San Francisco in mid September and we stayed at the Chancellor Hotel based on reviews from this forum. The weather was really great and we wore shorts every day. The hotel was in Union Square and was in the hub of alot of things to see and do. The street cars stopped right in front of the hotel and it was nice to just jump off and pop into our hotel. The hotel was close to great shopping and alot of nice places to dine was a stones throw away. We felt safe and had no problems figuring our way around. The hotel staff was so very friendly to us and we loved to grab a cookie or a piece of fruit at the end of a busy day before we went to our rooms. The hotel took great care of us and kept our rooms clean and tidy. Even when I forgot my favorite sandals behind when I went home, I called right away to housekeeping dept and the wonderful lady sent my shoes back home to me ! It was our first time to San Fran and I truly fell in love with your wonderful city. It was an adventure for us to explore all the neat places to see and places to eat. We visited Alcatraz with the audio tour. It was a great highlight for us ! Excellent tour ! We went to Solsilito Island, visited the Japanese gardens, toured Coit tower, the Exploratorium, Fisherman's wharf several times, Lombard street, the ancient fortune cookie factory, chinatown, Ghirdelli square for their awesome sundaes, Christie Park, the golden gate bridge and rode those wonderful streetcars everywhere ! I loved the ring a ling sounds from my hotel window and sometimes we even got a bit of jazz playing down from the streets drifting up to our hotel room. San Francisco is sooo wonderful and I fell in love with the city. I shall be back and we shall book again at the Chancellor hotel because we were taken care of by great staff ! Thank you for a wonderful visit !!!!

<Content>Brilliant !! We stayed here in room 1500 from September 22-28 on vacation from England. I'm afraid I do not have anything very original to say except that we had a great time! We arrived on the evening of the manager's meeting with guests. It was good for the manager's to be visible and most helpful to be able to chat with them.  A few non hotel tips which other guests may find helpful-* Always book your Alcatraz trip in advance* If you are in town for any length of time buy a MUNI travel pass.* A matter of taste of course, but think it is better to stayhere rather than Fisherman's Wharf - more central for everything.* Suggestions for eating - Loris for breakfast which is just nearby. Mortons for steak-it is just around the corner.As a lot of other contributors have mentioned the main difference with this hotel - it is the customer service ethos of the staff, We found everyone helpful and friendly, especially the bar staff.I think this service level is epitomised by Wes Tyler himself.I contacted him prior to arrival as it was a special trip for my girl friend's 50th birthday. On arrival there was a gift in our room along with a voucher for the restaurant - how thoughtful.Wes also helped us with tourist information before our arrival. Fortunately we got the chance to meet him and thank him in person. I am sure if you let him have any requests before you arrive he will do his best to help.All in all we had a great time and delighted we consulted Trip Advisor and selected this hotel. We would say you definitely get what you pay for - and then some!!As a general point, I am very surprised that other hotels do not respond to customer feedback in the way the Chancellor does - it seems a strange omission to me in a service environment.Once again, thanks to Wes and his staff for a great stay in San Francisco.

<Content>Great location Having studied the reviews of the hotel on this site i was confident i would enjoy my stay at this hotel.I checked in at about 9pm and was checked in quickly. My room on the 5th floor was clean and adequate for my stay. I was disappointed with my view, facing i think the rear of another hotel and some fans, but not everyone can have a front facing room!The hotel served a purpose for an excellent price in a excellent location. Check-in could have been more informative, but there were lots of information leaflets and booklets in the room. I had a cookie while i checked in (but only because i knew about them). However when i checked out, the guy was excellent, offered to hail a cab, offered coffee etc....The Chancellor was clean, comfortable and quiet and i would stay there again.Fell in love with San Francisco and will return....

<Content>The absolute best for location and value Our party stayed here from November 10th to the 15th and really enjoyed our time at the Chancellor and in San Francisco.We were a party of four and emailed the hotel a few weeks prior to our stay to request adjoining rooms. They made good on their promise and we had two sizeable rooms with good facilities on a high floor (1406/1407).The rooms are basic and not all that up to date but for SF they are sizeable as I said, clean and fully functional. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom a good size and again clean.The hotel lobby has the appearance of a much more expensive hotel and the breakfast in the restaurant is great, although the free coffee and cookies in the lobby are also a nice touch.The few requests we had of the front desk were all dealt with professionally and promptly. Basically, we couldn't fault the place and now the best part...it's location.You are right on union square near all the shops, the cable car station (which takes you straight to fisherman's wharf), chinatown, bars and nightlife, and also the BART station which we took across to Oakland for the Raiders game.I have stayed in Fisherman's wharf and you somehow feel safer on union square as well as having more to do and see within walking distance of your hotel.The Chancellor is amazing value and a much better hotel than much higher priced establishments (eg Holiday Inn, Wharf).Next time in SF, we will stay here again, no question.

<Content>Great hotel with Five star service Stayed at the Chancellor for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon at the beginning of November.From the moment of our arrival the staff made us feel welcome. I'd e-mailed Wes Tyler the week before to ask for a room with a view and also mentioned it was our honeymoon.The room we were given on the 13th floor had a great view over Union Square and we were also provided with complimentary champagne and a Chancellor Hotel photo frame which was a nice touch.As other reviews have stated, the rooms are fairly small, however I've never understood why anybody needs a huge hotel room. I go on holiday to see places not stay in my room! The room was cleaned meticulously every day and had all the facilities we needed. The location of the hotel could not be better - accessibility to all the attractions is great due to the cable car stopping right outside the door and all the other MUNI links being accessible from the bottom of Powell Street.My only advice is that if you need a taxi I wouldn't ask the bell boy to hail you one. When we asked him, he told us that we basically had no chance at that time of day because all the taxi's coming down the street would go straight to the hotel opposite (where the bell boy had a whistle to flag down cabs). He did try though. Eventually he advised us to stand in line at one of the larger hotels a couple of blocks down the street as we'd be more likely to get a result. This should not be taken as a criticism in any way as I'm sure the larger hotel was much more expensive than the Chancellor and was able to employ someone to spend all day hailing cabs!!When I'm next in San Francisco I'll definitely stay at the Chancellor again. Why do I say that this hotel offers 5 star service? The highest star hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon was the 4 star MGM Grand in Las Vegas - in my opinion, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff at the Chancellor blew the impersonal MGM Grand customer service out of the water.

<Content>Very pleased with the Chancellor Just wanted to say a huge thank you to the Chancellor Hotel and manager West Tyler for making our first trip to San Francisco a fabulous experience. The Chancellor Hotel was exactly what we had hoped for.....great location, clean, had character, etc. The room was actually larger than we had expected after reading reviews on tripadivsor. The bed was extremely comfortable...probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on, and noise was never an issue. We would not hesitate for a second to stay at the Chancellor again and will definitely recommend it to any of our friends and family who may be heading to San Francisco.

<Content>A Perfect Find We stayed at this lovely hotel 1st - 4th November and absolutely loved it. Without going into too much detail as all the previous positive reviews pretty much sum it up, the location, personal feel and GREAT value for money were an absolute pleasure.We stayed on the 13th floor which has great views of Union Square. Obviously if you have your window open it is a very noisy area, however I can only assume the windows are triple glazed as when shut you can't hear a thing. The hotel has a European feel about it in decor and layout. Great service in the intimate cocktail bar, fantastic breakfast in the hotel restaurant , reception desk staff that simply couldnt do enough for you and a fab little kiosk that help you with your tourist requirements.Should we find ourselves in San Francisco again some day, this will be our first port of call.Thankyou

<Content>Great Location, Great Value I stayed at the Chancellor for two nights in October and found the property to be well located, the staff to be friendly and helpful, and the rooms to be clean and comfortable.You will not be blown away by opulence, but the property is by no means dingy or unclean. Everything about the place is solid if unspectacular... everyting but the price! I could have spent almost $400 to stay at a Travelodge in the city, but instead I payed $140 at the Chancellor and that pushes my rating of the hotel into the realm of Excellent!I phoned the hotel the day before my arrival and requested a non-connecting room as high up as they could put me and they happily granted my request. I had no problems with noise from other rooms or from the streets below. Conveniently located, affordably priced, clean and comfortable. I couldn't have expected anything more. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Bravo!

<Content>absolutely perfect We stayed at the Chancellor for 6 nights from the 17th of October. I have to say that I couldn't fault the hotel at all. I've stayed in a lot of hotels around the world and the things that are important to me are location and service and for both of these the Chancellor scores top marks.The hotel is right off union square, 2 minute walk to the shops and within easy reach of a few good restaurants.The service in the hotel was what makes it stand out for me. We were staying for our first wedding anniversary and there was some nice goodies in our room when we arrived - a great personal touch. The staff were so welcoming, friendly and always ready with restaurant recommendations which always came up trumps.The rooms are fairly small and basic but when you are on holiday in a place like San Francisco you don't spend a lot of time sitting in your hotel room!!! My only tiny small negative comment is that the shower doesn't suit someone who is 6 foot 3 - I had to crouch down to get my head under it!!!Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone going on holiday to San Francisco - if we ever visit the area again there will only be one hotel we stay at, we really liked the Chancellor that much.

<Content>Great stay at the Chancellor We stayed at the Chancellor for five nights in October as our younger sister and friend were running in the Nike Women's Marathon. The location of the hotel was excellent...Nike Village was set up in Union Square as was the start line. Even though the hotel was booked solid, probably due to the Oracle conference as well, our request of adjoining rooms was granted. All the staff we had contact with were so friendly and helpful. The free use of the computer was welcomed as we were able to do web check-in. Our rooms were great and we loved the pillow menu...also the fact the blanket was in between two sheets. We had breakfast most days in the hotel restaurant and it was very good food and service. Our only disappointment was that we did not get a chance to meet Wes Tyler...our shuttle arrived before he could get to the lobby. Oh well, maybe next time... if we return to San Francisco, we will definately stay at the Chancellor.

<Content>Great Value for Money We stayed at the Chancellor from 3rd to 7th October 2006. It was a fantastic location (so much better than staying near Fisherman's Wharf) right on Union Square. We had a room at the front which can be a bit noisy so bring some ear plugs if you're a light sleeper! We recommend going next door to Sears for breakfast (can be long queues on a Saturday) they offer a great variety (the fresh fruit bowl was enormous). The rooms are a little dated but clean and perfectly adequate. If you're after 4 star this isn't it but it's great if you want somewhere with a good location at a very reasonable price.

<Content>Couldn't fault it....... Firstly, we would like to thank Wes Tyler for his generosity and excellent customer service during our honeymoon stay at The Chancellor. We stayed at The Chancellor for 4 nights in early October and booked through an British Travel Agent. When I advised Mr Tyler that it was our honeymoon, without hesitation he upgraded our room to a suite and 'threw in' a Romantic Package aswell (as detailed on the website).The room was of good size and the room was cleaned promptly on a daily basis. We had no problem with any frustrating noises - just the sound of the bustling San Francisco streets below.As other reviews have mentioned, the hotel is ideally located on Union Square, with great access to the whole of San Francisco via various modes of transport. Also good restaurants within walking distance - in all directions !The coffee and cookies within the reception area, are a lovely touch, which we enjoyed....maybe too often ! We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to friends/family - indeed we already have.If you are wanting 5* luxury within a large corporate chain, Hilton, Radisson, etc - this is not the hotel for you. However, if you want a hotel which has a family feel, friendly staff, great location, excellent value for money and provided excellent customer service - I wouldn't look any further than The Chancellor Hotel on Union Square.A credit to San Francisco.

<Content>never again We spent two nights at the Chancellor. The location was great for us- but the hotel was not what I expected after all the great reviews on this web site, which is what I used to make a decision about which hotel to stay at. The rooms are awful. Small is not the only problem. The people are friendly, but I need more than that from a hotel. I would not choose this hotel again. Also, they tried to put through a hold on my card for expenses that was higher than any other hotel I've stayed at did under the same conditions. We were pre-paid for two nights, taxes included, so I can't figure that one out. They said it was computer generated? Never happened to me before, and I would never stay here again.

<Content>Couldn't have picked a better place When I first booked this hotel I was a little nervous because of all the bad reveiws. But compared to other hotels in the area I thought it was the best and closest to the attractions. It turned out to be great!!! The parking (as many have complained) is a bit tight. You have two parallel parking spots in front of the hotel. Which if you come at the busy time of day would be hard to maneuver. But luckily we were a bit late so we had no problem at all. We splurged and got the suite. Which I definetly reccommend. I had read that if you want a quiet room to ask, and that there was a room where you could hear the cable cars and a jazz player played all night! I thought it romantic so I asked for a room with views of the cable cars. We heard great music all night and had a great trip. This hotel is close to all the main attractions just a cable car away. The only con was although nice, the staff was fake and a little stuffy. They all seemed to have fake french accents. That was tacky. But I enjoyed my stay and may come back if i'm ever in that part of town again. I also love how the manager takes time and cares enough to respond to the negative reviews they get. Overall I would definetly reccommend this hotel.

We had requested a room on an upper floor with a view of Union Square and this is exactly what we got. Nice touches, sweets, pillow menu, cookies and coffee for breakfast. Lovely lady on reception gave us perfect driving instructions which brought us directly from Salinas to the front door of the hotel without one mistake. Sorry the I can't remember her name but it started with an S and she had an accent. Would definitely stay here again.Mary Cochrane

<Content>Very Nice Stay at the Chancellor We recently spent Sept 26-28, at the Chancellor. The posted room photos (Sept 29) mirrors our room exactly. The rooms are clean, small, but not too small, and the walls a little thin. Nice size closet and great tub! There are free newspapers and coffee in the lobby which was nice. The hotel staff is great. The first night we made the mistake of leaving the window open and the street noise was a little bothersome鈥攂ut as one reviewer said, the hotel IS right in the city and on a trolley line鈥攚hich is part of its charm and the location the reason we stayed there in the first place. Subsequent nights we left the window closed and turned the fan on and slept very comfortably. Even the others in our party, who usually would not stay at a hotel without air conditioning, slept comfortably with windows closed and fan going. The hotel is very central. The free wi-fi made it very easy to plan our sightseeing. We went everywhere by bus鈥攗sed the trip planner on the Metropolitan Transit鈥檚 511 transit website to plan our bus route and bus number# (---). The hotel was full during our stay and a large group of Japanese students filled the restaurant in the morning. Not a problem -- we just went next door to Sears Fine Food. We had very good service and the really enjoyed the small Swedish pancakes (get there early or you will have to wait in line). We had a very nice stay at the Chancellor and will definitely stay there again on our next visit.

<Content>Good experience at the Chancellor This was my first time in San Francisco and I chose the Chancellor because of the good reviews on this site. Firstly, the room wasn't as small as I had been expecting, going by other's experiences. But then again I was on my own so it probably was more spacious. I had come from a stay in a New York hotel, where you literally couldn't turn around without tripping over the bed or your suitcase so it was a welcome change! Bathroom was great, loved the oversized tub and shower water was always hot and had good pressure. I did feel that the wall between my room and next door were a little thin - one night I could hear murmurs of conversation quite loud and was expecting a full night of it ahead. However, it seemed like friends left the room soon after so wasn't too noisy. I had a room on 14th floor so noise from below wasn't a big problem. Even though it was warm, I kept window closed and could turn fan on if it felt warm. Service downstairs was friendly...only problem I had before checking in was getting a confirmation email that confused me completely. I had booked the room for 7 nights and had been given an average price per night. Then I got this email a couple of days before with a totally different room rate for the first 2 nights and then another rate for the remaining 5. When I worked it all out in my head, it came to the same total amount as the original price I had agreed. It just confused me - I wish I hadn't got that subsequent email when everything had been agreed on booking. Only other snag is that I came back one day at around 4 o'clock to dump some shopping and rest for a while before heading back out. My room was just about to be cleaned so I couldn't really go in. It wasn't a big deal, I said I'd come back in 20 minutes and it was done by then. As I was on an upper floor, I suppose it was just the time of day when the staff could get to it. But it's a minor gripe when the room was always clean, the staff were accommodating at all times and the price was good for the great location in San Francisco. I'd definitely recommend it and would stay there again if I'm ever in the city again.

<Content>Chancellor is okay, but not great I booked this hotel solely based on TripAdvisor. I would suggest looking elsewhere. First the good then the bad.Good: great location. Right across from a cable stop. Almost the center of Union Square area. Bookstore next door, great restaurants in the area, safe and clean streat. Hotel was clean, staff was very friendly and helpful, lobby charming, free coffee and wireless, quaint old hotel (with old pictures as proof). You feel like you stepped back in time. Bellhops were the nicest. We were there for their managers' greet that they have once a month-nice touch. A lot of activity in the area. Very professional staff.Bad: no air. Other than a ceiling fan, they have no fresh air to bring into the room, air conditioner knob doesn't do much and it's too loud outside to even consider sleeping with the window open. Rooms very small (European style). A bit long in the tooth (chair was stained, a little rust in bathroom, but not too bad). Walls paper thin. Not only heard slamming doors and speaking, we understood their conversations. Because you cannot run an air conditioner or fan, you can't block it out. Between the noise on the street and the noise from the room next door-far too noisey for a light to moderate sleeper. Summary: Be prepared to pay $200 for a very small and noisey room. Next time I will pay a little more for a better stay likely off of Powell Street.

<Content>Excellent location The hotel is clean and comfortable (with a pillow menu should need it!!), but it's main selling point is it's position - perfectly located in the heart of San Francisco, just across the road from Union Square, and on one of the excellent tram lines.Ultimately, SF has so much to offer you should spent little time in the hotell, but when you do, the Chancellor is perfect as a well-run city-centre hotel.(Just as a word of advice, we almost stayed in a hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf area of the city - glad we didn't; this area is a bit tacky and seasidey with little to really offer other than trips to Alcatraz, which is not to be missed. Much better to stay around Union Sq, and take a tram ride.)

<Content>As a Travel Agent, I will be sending my clients here!! As a travel agent, I had 4 hotels in mind for my recent stay In San Francisco. I selected the Chancellor, and I'm So thrilled I did!.From the moment we arrived until the moment we left (Just today), the staff were very friendly and were quick to provide any assistance needed. The hotel rooms are kept very clean, with a huge walk in closet, equiped with umbrella, iron, Board, safe, and plenty of hangers. The bathroom in our room (1500), didnt' have a window, and was a tad on the smaller side (typical for the older hotels), but it served our purpose well, and I must add the towels in this hotel are the BEST smelling towels ANYWHERE! The hotel does have access to an all night parking garage, just about 2 blocks away, which requires you going several blocks in reality to get there, because of the one-way street situation, however you can request valet parking for a few dollars more. (might be worth the grief if you would rather not deal with busy traffic). No car, in my opinion, is necessary in San francisco, unless you plan to take a trip out to Napa or other surrounding areas.The hotel is right next to Sears Restaurant, serving its Famous pancakes. This hotel is not only surrounded by great shopping and restaurants, but you are only about 5 blocks or so from the main entrance of Chinatown, a great convenience!The Cable car runs right out front which makes it great when you are coming back from the Wharf or other areas, you can jump right off and be at the hotel.This hotel is a gem! You will be spending almost half of what the other hotels across the street charge (Sir Francis Drake and Crowne Plaza), but you will be getting the same location, and possible more of old San Francisco Charm in your hotel.You truly can't go wrong here!!! Thanks again to the manager and staff for making our stay a great one!

<Content>Location, location, location After much research, I chose this hotel based on price and the reviews from other tripadvisor members. I was extremely happy with my choice. I don't think there is a better location, if you want to be in the heart of things. Everything is at your doorstep - the cable car stops at the corner, hundreds of great shops and a multitude of restaurants and diners, all within walking distance.The service was wonderful and the staff were extremely helpful. Of course the complimentary internet access, coffee, fruit and yummy cookies are great perks!The rooms are a little small, but VERY comfortable and clean. Sears next door is wonderful for both breakfast and dinner...try their famous pancakes!I would definitely recommend this hotel; I think it is great value for money compared to other pricey hotels in the area.

<Content>Chancellor Hotel - Exceeded All Expectations The Chancellor was exactly as described on tripadvisor.com (and the main reason we booked it). It was very good value for the money (we reserved the park and breakfast package) the rooms were clean and confortable and the staff was professional and curtious. The parking for the hotel was located around the corner and it was too much of a hassle to park (however, a car is not needed while you are in SF) The hotel restaurant was a little pricey, but afterall, this is San Francisco. A recommended restaurant is the Marine Memorial restaurant around the corner on about the 12 floor...you get a great meal, a wonderful view of the SF skyline and almost no one is there (many people believe it is a private club, which it is not)We would definitely stay here again and look forward to visiting this incredible city again in the near future.

<Content>Atmosphere and Service The hotel had an old San Francisco feel that created a wonderful atmosphere and ambience.I booked with the Chancellor primarily because of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and I wasn't disappointed. This is a great hotel. I requested a room with lots of light and a view if possible, and I received it. The staff was incredibly helpful and the food (I only had breakfast) in the restaurant was very good.As for the room (I was in 1003), it was on the small side. For one person it was quite comfortable but probably not what you are looking for if you want a romantic getaway. I loved the bathroom with the huge soaking tub and the window that looked out onto the fire escape. There was wonderful natural light in the bathroom which is something you won't find at other hotels. I could picture Sam Spade crawling out the bathroom window and escaping down the fire escape when the person he was investigating arrived back at his room.There was a big window in the room which i always left open a bit. You could definitely hear the street noise, but I got used to it quickly and it created a feeling that i was really in the city. The flashing pink sign from the starlight dance hall across the street softly flashed through the window at night. Someone might find that irritating, but I found it charming and it didn't interfere with my sleep.The free wireless worked perfectly for me.The bed was very comfortable.The closet was spacious, but the drawers on the chest under the TV did stick , and I figured out I couldn't close them all the way.The staff were all sweet, solicitous, and polite. I was only there for a few days but they recognized me and treated me with familiarity.The lady selling the tours I would call the Tour Nazi. She's very intimidating, but I think she is an independent contractor with the hotel. HOWEVER, the assistance she did give me was right on target and just what I needed. Just be prepared for her firm, no-nonsense manner.Unfortunately, I had to cut my stay short in San Francisco and at the hotel. I had to check out earlier than planned. I gave the front desk the appropriate notice, and they didn't blink an eye about it or give me any grief.I could go on and on about the hotel. I would definitely stay there again. However, just because there are well-deserved high reviews of this place, don't expect a luxury hotel. This is a hotel for mature, reasonable people who want a nice, comfortable place to stay in a great location.

<Content>A real gem in the heart of the city As three female friends travelling from Australia we thoroughly enjoyed our 'Three to a room' Chancellor experience! We knew from other reviews that the rooms were small so it was no hardship when the third bed was moved in. We simply moved the beds, put the suitcases in the large walk-in robe, moved the chair and table and rolled out the extra bed for the 4 nights we stayed there! It wasn't a problem, in fact we enjoyed the feeling of having a 'sleepover' . We were charmed by the hotel, the staff and the welcome we received. We loved being able to get coffee and cookies at any time of the day or night , we loved the noise of the cable cars and all the sounds of a big American city. We wanted a real San Francisco experience and staying at this hotel gave us everything, friendliness, character and easy access to all the sights. We will definitely recommend this hotel to all of our friends and hope to stay there again on our next travels through San Francisco.One final tip if you are going 'three to a room' is to request a corner room - Rm 500 was great for us.

<Content>Its All True........Excellent Place to Stay My wife and I stayed in the chancellor hotel for 3 nights during our honeymoon in the states. I had spent literally hours on the internet planning the trip, hotels etc. and partly based on what i'd read i choose the chancellor. We weren't dissapointed. It's situated right on union square, a more central downtown location you won't find for the same price. The room was well equiped with internet access, it was medium sized and very clean with sufficient storage space and a safe. The cleaners came daily and changed towels etc. and generally tided up. The hotel doesn't have air conditioning but don't be deterred because the fan on the ceiling is sufficient and (apparently) san fran doesn't get that hot during the summer as it's next to the ocean. We arrived really tired having flown from europe and the staff were extremely helpful. They gave us a bonus breakfast card for the value of $42 ( although its not a huge amount for 2 people for 3 days, still they didn'thave to give it to us) and they left a bottle of champayne in our room as i'd written during the booking that we were a honeymoon couple. The hotel is in good condition. Guests can have free coffee, biscuits, newspaper, fruit and internet access in reception area. The cable car runs right outside the front door too. All in all we had a delightful stay at the chancellor and the prices are very reasonable ($150/night for the room) and the service is great. We will definitely be returning one day.

<Content>good hotel in great location We stayed at the chancellor for four nights at the start of our honeymoon. The hotel is in a really great location to see the rest of San francisco, the trams run right past the front door. The room in the hotel wasn't huge but was really clean and comfortable, and to be honest with you there's so much to see and do that we weren't in our room that much. The staff were lovely, especially when our bags had been lost by the airline when we first arrived. There's free coffee and cookies every morning and free popcorn on an evening! If you want some nightlife I would reccomend the starlight room,it's really cool(you just need to ignore the drinks prices!)

<Content>Great Location, nice friendly helpful staff, very pleasant stay in sanfrancisco We stayed in the Chancellor from August 10 to August 16th. As you can see from the date we travelled on Thursday 10th, the day of the horrendous disruption of flights from the UK, so it was such a relief when we arrived at this Hotel to be greeted with a lovely nice clean room. For 2 of us the room was just fine, over looking powell street (one of the main streets around Union Square). The Hotel staff were very friendly and gave us a print off of bus routes to Fisherman's Wharf, Monster Park (where the 49ers play), Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park (which is in a completely different area, despite having the same name). The Hotel is in a great location, basically on Union Square, so good for shopping. The attractions of 'both' Golden Gate's, Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz are only a short bus or tram ride away. Overall we found the Hotel to be excellent value for money in a good location.**Oh, and there's free Coffee and Tea in the lobby area**

<Content>Convenience and friendliness We spent three nights at the Chancellor in August. We had a room on the fifteenth floor with a view of Union Square (lucky I guess since we didn't request it), and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. From reading some of the reviews, I expected to find a tiny room, but although it wasn't spacious, it didn't feel cramped. High ceilings and a large window gave the room an airy feeling, and it was clean and the bed comfortable. We closed the window at night to keep out the chill, so we didn't notice any noise. There were lots of extras such as wireless internet, CD player/radio/clock, umbrella and iron in the closet, plus other amenities.The staff was friendly, we felt welcomed, and the location is convenient to shops, many restaurants, cable cars, and other transporation. There was a tour desk in the lobby (open 9am to 9pm) where we bought our muni passes, and we could also have made arrangements there for tours or a Dollar rental car. There was a bar and restaurant (open for breakfast and lunch) off the lobby, although we didn't use either. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Chancellor again. In fact, I hope I get the opportunity.

<Content>Comfortable with historical charm My girlfriend and I stayed at the Chancellor on our roadtrip. Our first issue was stopping the car and it was difficult given the tight streets with the cable car tracks right in the middle. We had to do a big loop in order to drive up facing the right direction, but that鈥檚 just San Francisco. Stopping in front of the hotel for the valet parking was difficult when we arrived in the evening since the whole block was full of parked cars despite it being a no parking zone. Eventually, we got the valet to take my car to their undisclosed parking location. Be aware that you need to give 20 minutes notice to get your car back. There was a mix-up one time when I asked for my car and they somehow brought the wrong one. But the error was corrected quickly and the staff was friendly. The valet parking cost seems like a lot but considering the price of the rooms and the nature of driving in San Francisco, it鈥檚 quite reasonable.The room was a touch on the small side, but given the location and history of the building, it was a minor concern. We were provided with a spacious closet that included a safe which was a nice touch. The bathroom was fine and the little touches made it feel cozier (like the rubber duckie and the not-often-provided cotton swabs). Watch the lip walking into the bathroom though because you might trip or at least hurt your toes. Another nice touch to the room was the pillow menu. We couldn鈥檛 be bothered to ask for different pillows, but knowing that they had a varied selection of interesting pillows was comforting.The Chancellor had one computer in the lobby for public internet use. The set-up seemed like the computer was off-limits, but all you have to do is ask to use it. The room is set up for wireless internet access, but you need your own laptop of course.One really helpful thing was the map they provided. It had all of the major tourist attractions and really made it easier for us to plan our trip.All in all, we were quite comfortable at the Chancellor and the staff was very friendly (including answering our questions about the 4.0 earthquake that happened while we were in San Fran). Considering the charm of the building coupled with the excellent location next to Union Square, the Chancellor proved to be a good choice for our vacation.

<Content>Great Hotel !!! We stayed at the Chancellor hotel for 8 nights in August while visiting San Francisco. We couldn't have been happier with the whole experience.We had requested a quiet room on a high floor , the room was clean and tidy and everything we had asked for. The friendly and helpful staff made us feel very welcome and they were always on hand to answer any questions we may have had.The location is perfect, right in union square and literally 5 mins away from everything, shops , Restaurants and bars. Also on the famous San Francisco Tram line so perfect to get around the city.An ideal base for any trip to San Francisco.Thank you for a pleasant stay we had a fantasic time and loved the city of San Francisco.

<Content>What a gem this hotel is The Chancellor has one of the most honest websites I have come accross. When you read it and the postive trip advisor reviews you know what you will get. You will stay in a real hotel that has not been modernised by the big chains. You will know this hotel represents excellent value for money hotel and you will know it has small bedrooms and bathrooms. You will know the staff will be polite and friendly and the hotel will be nice and clean. You will know there is no A/C and you know that if something does go wrong the staff will help you sort it out. Finally you will know you are in an old building in the heart of an historical city .So that's exactly what you should expect and that's what we got!We stayed for four nights in July and booked a suite and a twin room for the children. The rooms were small but had everyhting we needed including a huge wardrobe so we could get the suitcases out of the way. The bathrooms were a little dated BUT they were immaculately clean, an adequate size and had an excellent shower. There were nice touches in the rooms - A jar of sweets (candies), the little yellow duck in the bathroom and the bottle of wine. A CD player in the rooms was a bonus as was the wire to connect ourt MP3 player to it. The pillow menu is a great idea. Things like this make you realise that you are staying in a hotel where the managers really care about the comfort of their guests. We enjoyed the coffee and cookies in the lobby, we appreciated the help offered when we asked questions. We liked being in the centre of town. We took good advice from the gift shop and bought a pass for all the public transport which was great value for money. Yes we did hear the noises of the city but how much better is that than being in the sterile envoironment of a triple glazed air conditioned room? We travelled the ocean to experience all the SFO has to offer and that includes her sounds. I am fortuntate that I stay in many quality hotels. I have to say that, as a city centre hotel, the Chancellor takes a lot of beating. We loved it and, if we return to SFO, this is where we will stay. I say to you all again.....read the honest website and the good reviews. The Chancellor is an hotel that delivers what it promises - nothing more and nothing less.

Matthew was charming and full of good tips too. It was a bit noisy at night if windows were open, but then we were in Union Square! The bar is cosy and my son loved the complementary popcorn and cookies. The lobby was great.

<Content>Highlight of our Trip! The place just keeps getting better and better. We were a bit exhausted from a long drive, and we were ready to get checked into our hotel. We made our way into a nice lobby with friendly staff and complementary cookies. There were lots of other little touches in the room that will leave a lasting impression but I will leave that for you to discover.It is nice old style city hotel with the benefit of some modern conveniences such as movies on demand and wireless internet in the rooms. I suppose the rooms are a bit small, but we had a big closet in our room with luggage holders, so we never felt cramped at all.The breakfast is very good. We spent five nights and had breakfast five mornings.We were on the 10th floor, so maybe we were above a bit of the city noise that others have complained about, but we found it to be very quiet.If you like the idea of a hotel with some character in a great central location, I highly recommend the Chancellor Hotel.

<Content>Completely satisfied! My son and I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel and had a lovely experience! The rooms were charming -- very clean and quiet. Before making this reservation, I noticed that at least one party thought her room was too small, but I found it very adequate in size. I was somewhat expecting to be turned off by the size of the room based on her comment, but it was not a problem at all for two people. The staff was outstanding. We actually ordered breakfast as room service two mornings and it was delivered promptly. On the second morning, I noticed that our breakfast order was still on the doorknob, so I called about it. The polite gentleman who answered the phone in the restaurant apologized and assured me that I could order right then and he would bring it up to our room in 10 minutes. That is exactly what happened, and we were not at all inconvenienced. It was an absolute pleasure dealing with the front desk. Tthe valet was also very helpful, hailing taxis for us both mornings. The front desk also gave us excellent recommendations on places to eat. They handed us a good map of San Francisco when we checked in, and they recommended a total of three restaurants that were all outstanding. I would definitely stay there again. Oh yes, the showers were great too! I would recommend this place to anyone. It was a great location too -- just a few blocks from Chinatown and right next door to Borders.

<Content>Absolutely THE BEST We (two 50ish  two 20ish) recently returned from a tremendous holiday in California which commenced with two nights at the Chancellor Hotel. We had booked two rooms months in advance and the accommodation more than met our expectations. What a tremendous start to a memorable holiday. The hotel has a fantastic location right across from Union Square. Whether walking or cable car - everything is right at your feet.The Chancellor hotel is gorgeous. It reminded us of something right out of an old movie - classy! From the lobby to the roof top, this hotel has true charm.We were absolutely impressed with the service, cleanliness and the attitude of everyone. The d茅cor of the rooms reflects the architecture and is refreshing and relaxing. The hotel Manager, Wes Tyler, has his heart in this San Francisco hotel without a doubt! If you plan on going to San Fran ..stay at a hotel that reflects this great city.We have recommended the Chancellor to everyone heading off to San Fran and, with any luck, we will be back soon. Merci鈥e absolutely loved it!

<Content>Great historic hotel We spent two nights in the Chancellor and were very pleased with the room, bathroom, location, and service. The hotel is in a very safe area on the cable car line and close to BART. The only disadvantage was the lack of air conditioning. We did go to the city in the middle of a heat wave, but the room still did not cool off during the cool nights. I would love to stay in this hotel again but would want to check out other rooms (on another side, another level) that might be cooler.

<Content>you dont know when your lucky!! Stayed at the Chancellor 6-9th July.This place is an absolute bargain. Nice rooms the best location you could ever have and just the right of level of comfort without declining into decadence. If you go to San Francisco to sit looking at your room then good luck!. Its perfectly located to use the cable cars, you can walk to china town and we caught the bus to Golden Gate park and Haight ashbury.Had a nice little bar , with many local customers, which says a lot and provided some interesting conversations.Just be clear what your priorities are when you book. (see Mr Tylers comments above) I was delighted ,would stay again for sure. A similar hotel in a similar location in the West End of London would cost $400-$500 per night so grab the bargain which is the Chancellor!!

My husband and I travel a lot and we have never been in a hotel where they give you a choice of pillows! We had a drink at the hotel bar with our drink coupon before we went to a play. Bar has a friendly atmosphere. Location of hotel is excellent and in a safe place. We loved the Chancellor and will be back. The staff was great and helpful. We didn't know about the cookies until we reread the reviews. The ONLY thing missing was a coffee pot in your room but they did have free coffee downstairs. The hotel had everything one needed and I can't wait to revisit!

<Content>Location! The Chancellor was a great value in Union Square. The room and the bathroom were perfect for a weekend getaway. The only con... the heat wave! I thought the evenings were going to be a little cooler, especially since that's what I had read on the boards . Of course, management cannot control that and we did the best we could with the ceiling fan and showering before going to sleep. I think that's the best advice we can give anyone visiting now during the summer.

<Content>great base for exploring city Couldn't think of a better place to be based in order to explore this wonderful city. Just across from Union Square, the Chancellor is central to just about everything San Francisco has to offer. The staff were welcoming at all times - even when we checked out at 4.30am - and the little extras such as free internet, cookies at reception and a welcoming bottle of wine in our room made for a great stay. We were able to do just about everything from here - made tour reservations in the hotel lobby, found out where the nearest laundromat was and where to get baseball tickets - although the amount of time we actually spent at the hotel was miniscule compared to our time out trekking the city. Would definitely recommend to others.

<Content>Choose the Chancellor, you won't go far wrong!!! Holidays are very important to us, so we always invest a lot of time and research when booking our hotels. We are so glad we took this time out, as the many great reviews of the Chancellor pursuaded us to choose it over many other locations around the city such as fishermans wharf, nob hill and chinatown.For those of you who are still undecided, please choose the Chancellor Hotel. It's location on Union Square is perfect if you want to tour the city, spend time shopping, eat/dine or even take in a show. The cable car stops just outside, and you are also close to other means of transport.We had a fantastic view of Union Square from our room as we emailed Wes Tyler ahead to request this. Wes replied within a day, superb customer service which beats many Five Star hotels I have stayed in.The hotel itself admittedly is basic, but I liked this, you must remember that this is a base camp and you rarely spend that much time in your room. Don't be put off by this, the hotel is clean, staff are friendly, food is great and beds are very comfortable, they even provide you with a pillow menu!!!The iron and ironing board were a godsend as my travel iron has seen better days and a digital safe is also included.If you are on your way to San Francisco, we hope you enjoy it as much as we did. It's truly a unique and wonderful city.

<Content>Nice location, shame about the room This hotel has such a great location it's difficult to really consider other faults, but I had a few during my stay which are worth mentioning.Firstly I arrived during the penalty shoot-out of the France-Italy World Cup final. Despite the cheery greeting by reception there was no offer for help with luggage at all. They must love their soccer!Secondly the room was a bunker. It was located on the second floor and so dark (due to having a window overlooking a fire escape and surrounded by walls) you needed to have the lights on during the day. Lastly room service wasn't available on the day I was there (apparently only Weds-Sats only!.Overall great spot but shame about the other negative points.

<Content>Great Hotel Like the previous reviewer from Cairns we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Chancellor. The location is great, near the shops, the cable car stops and right next to a Border's bookstore. The hotel was clean and the extras were a nice touch. Highly recommended and excellent value. Must also compliment the manager Wes who was always responsive to our emails whenever we had any questions.

<Content>Chancellor made our stay a great one My wife and I stayed in the Chancellor from 7/9 to 7/11 and we can't think of any complaints. From booking our room over the phone to arriving and checking in etc.. the hotel staff was superb. Everyone was very friendly and professional and it made for a great stay. The Union Square location made it easy to get around. We liked the size of the rooms. They were more than sufficient and clean and that's all we needed. Kudos to Mr. Tyler and staff for restoring our faith in hotel customer service.

<Content>Great Location..nice hotel We stayed at the Chancellor for two nights. You cannot beat the location, it's perfect. I would have really liked a room on a higher floor with a view, but it was a busy time (Semicon), and ours was just fine. We did have a minor mishap. We had a concert the first night in Berkeley, and we wanted to check in to the hotel, get our bags upstairs and head out. We got stuck in some traffic, so we got to the hotel with NO time to spare. I asked the clerk at the desk if we could leave the car at the curb while we dropped our bags in the room. She said it wouldn't be a problem, as you are allowed 20 minutes at the curb. Well we were back within 10 minutes and our car had already been sent to the valet parking garage, apparantly there was a miscommunication amoungst the staff. It only set us back 15-20 minutes, but it was frustrating and we didn't feel like the staff was very apologetic about it. That was made worse by the valet driver visibly showing his disappointment at the lack of a tip...I didn't feel like tipping when my car shouldn't have been taken to begin with..call me crazy. The valet driver doesn't work for the hotel, so I didn't hold that against them, but it was tacky. Other than that incident, I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. They helped with resturant recommendations and directions to different attractions. I would not hesitate to stay here again....in fact I probably won't even bother looking elsewhere.

<Content>Great Stay !! We just visited on July 13th and 14th (wife and I). The Chancellor gets such great reviews here on TA that I will dig deep to find some criticism. Sorry, could not find anything to complain about. Great location, Great value, Cosy room, Great staff,. Even the other guests all seemed nice. I left one morning at 4:45 and the Doorman was very cheery ( I suspect all the Doorman are cheery in their sharp looking suits as compared to the outfit the Sir Francis Drake guy has to wear across the street) I will only stay at the Chancellor when in Union Square.

The rooms were small but cosy and the location is fantastic...walk down the road and you have all the big stores (macys, abercrombie, american eagle, borders, virgin etc), its very convenient. Plus theres a little free coffee shop service downstairs which we loved. We will definately be back and we want the same room (800) that we stayed in!!

<Content>A respite from the noise and bustle We stayed in San Franciso for four nights and, as expected, found it very noisy and busy, particularly around Union Square. But the hotel was a gem! We slept brilliantly (wish I could say that now we're home with jetlag!) and the pillow menus were great - I slept 3 nights on a buckwheat pillow, lovely. Free coffee, cookies and apples in the lobby were very good. Some nice touches like a token for buy one get one free glass of wine at the bar. We booked the romantic package for the first night which enabled us to have a great room on the 15th floor with view of Macys and Union Square - so pretty at night. I must admit we didn't find the hotel staff as friendly as Seattle but they were approachable and helpful. The rooms are fairly small - but that wasn't a problem - and the deep bathtub was lovely (and yes, we did keep checking it to make sure it didn't flow over!!). The closet space was very useful although the rail could do with a dusting(!!). Apart from that, the room was very clean and well maintained.Definitely recommended for a central place to stay in San Francisco.

<Content>Kudos to the Chancellor My husband and I just returned from an anniversary trip to San Francisco and a four night stay at the Chancellor Hotel. We enjoyed our visit and the hotel very much. As many have said, the rooms are a bit on the small side. But so what? You're in San Francisco--you won't be spending THAT much time in the room. The room was comfortable and clean. Amenities were above and beyond what you find in some of the larger chain hotels. The deep tub w/bath salts--and the rubber ducky--made for a nice extra after a long day of walking up and down (and up and down... and up and down) the steep hills.The hotel is in a very convenient location for taking public transportation, making it very easy to get around. If walking is your thing (it isn't really mine) the hotel is close enough to everything that you can walk easily. You can grab a trolley car in front of the hotel, or easily grab a cab (we used both the Muni system and took cabs---both were effective from this hotel).The staff was very friendly and helpful. We made tour arrangements in the lobby and that was great. Susan was very helpful. The tour company picked us up at the hotel in the morning and dropped us back off at the end of the day. Very convenient.The bar is small and cozy and is a great way to either start or end your evening. Alicia, the bartender, was very helpful and gave us dining and sight-seeing tips. It was nice to be able to visit with other guests in the bar area.I would also like to thank Wes Tyler. I e-mailed him prior to our trip and told him it was our anniversary and asked if we could possibly have a room with a view. We arrived to find ourselves on the 15th floor with a view of the water and of Union Square. If that wasn't enough, on the day of our anniversary, we returned to the room to find a nice little surprise waiting for us. We appreciated (and enjoyed) the sentiment very much. I'm not sure when we'll be back in the area, but I will certainly recommend the Chancellor to interested friends.

<Content>Great stay at the Chancellor I usually Priceline hotels often staying a 5 stars for 2-3 star prices. SInce I was traveling with my sister-in-law and did not want to share a double bed with her I went the more traditional route. Based on reviews from TripAdvisor I picked The Chancellor. From my intial call to make the reservation, to their personal call to confirm the reservation a few days ahead and answer any questions, to the treatment we received during our stay, I was very satisfied. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location could not have been better. The room was clean and I enjoyed the bath salt's. If they could accomidate 4 to a room I'd be there this month when I travel with my husband and kids. Excellent experince.

<Content>Solid hotel for budget-minded travelers I agree with most of the posted reviews that the Chancellor is an excellent value in a very expensive city. Overall the pros (clean, very friendly housekeeping staff, great service from bellboy Martin, super location, great price) definitely outweighed the cons (mattress and bathroom fixtures had seen better days, brusque desk staff), and we will stay there again next time we are in SF.

<Content>Fantastic Location and Great Hotel I searched the Internet looking for a good hotel in San Francisco and boy did I find one! Location, location, location. Right on Union Square which is beautiful, on the cable car route and Muni bus stop what more could you ask for to ride around this beautiful city. My friend and I were on a three week tour of California and this was by far the best hotel we stayed in!!! Yeah the rooms aren't large but you are staying in SAN FRANCISCO what are you doing in your rooms? But they were comfortable and clean. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. If I visit San Francisco again I will be certainly staying here...

<Content>Not the most glamarous This isn't the worst hotel but definately isn't the best. The rooms were tiny and so were the beds. The bathroom looked like it haden't been updated since the 1940s but the rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. It was also a great location. Maybe it was because we had just come from staying in Pebble Beach and Monterey, but I wouldn't stay here again. But for the price, its worth it.

<Content>Great experience and they really do take care of you Alright, I've been reading reviews on TripAdvisor for quite some time now and havenever written a review myself simply because i never deemed it necessary. Not in my interest you might say.But I really must show my appreciation of how much of a find the Chancellor Hotel is if you really want to have a good time in SF for a budget price yet still have a comfortable room and good service.Now i'm a fairly young guy- mid twenties, but I'm pretty picky. After booking the hotel I was expecting a good location, clean and efficient rooms and a decent bathroom, not much else. But after staying there this past weekend with my girlfriend, I was really impressed on how much they've kept their standards high. We had a romantic time, even had a view, and the room has EVERYTHING you need. Safe, extra towels, extra covers, MP3 player, etc. . .The rooms aren't huge, but they aren't tiny either. European is a good word for it, but the spacing is just right for two people and the beds were comfy. (I've lived in Europe for a few years so I can say that). Location is great, right across from Francis Drake Hotel which has a cool bar with a view in it, and right near the trams. Almost everything is accesible. Plus the staff were very helpful, even when one dude at the front desk had lost his voice completely the poor guy still strained his throat to tell me (very quietly but politely) good dinner spots on the map. Honestly, I was very impressed. And that's really not easy.Would definetely stay there again and have recommended my picky friends to stay there aswell when they go to SF.

<Content>Chancellor is a great Hotel Just got back from staying at the Chancellor Hotel from 6 thru 12 June. Most reviews were right on the money and this hotel is the best bang for your dollar. Clean rooms with a great location and a staff that is so helpful. Matthew gave us suggestions for two restaurants that were reasonable and had very good food. L'ottavo (Italian food) on Sutter St. just a few blocks from the hotel. Foleys (Irish Pub) on O'Farrell only a few blocks from the hotel. We also got a 3 day Muni pass for $18.00 for the Trolleys and public transportation. This was great because we would hop on and hop off all day as we saw all the sights. At the Chancellor you can pick up the Trolley just a few doors away. We also had fun renting a tandem bike from Saddles down at the Wharf. We took the bike path along the bay and up and across the Golden Gate Bridge and back again. If we had to do it over again we would have continued down to Sausilito after we crossed the bridge (as this is all down hill) and then take a ferry back to the Wharf. Just a reminder that the seats on these bikes are small so your butt is going to be sore during and after the ride. The bar at the Chancellor is small so you can talk to other guests and locals and share their experiences both good and bad. One couple told us how wonderful Muir Woods was but their tour didn't give them enough time there ( a little over and hr) . The tour would have cost us $44.00 per person so we rented a car at Thrify on O'Farrell for $29.95 per day. When we got there they also gave us an upgrade for the same price. We hiked for 3 1/2 hrs early in the morning and had a calm wonderful morning among the huge trees. We then drove up to Sonoma (wine country) then down to Sausilito. We continued on and toured areas in San Francisco and drove down the famous Lombard St. Can't wait to visit San Francisco again and definitely would stay at the Chancellor again!!

<Content>Great Location The location of this hotel is perfect, right in the middle of it all!. You can catch the cable car, or if you like walking up and down hilly streets....you can walk to just about anything. Chinatown and Union Square are especially close. The rooms are small, but very clean. The staff was friendly, and there is a small bar area in the lobby. Vallet parking was very nice if you have a car with you. So, for those who are out to explore San Francisco and not the hotel this is a great place, at an affordable price....I paid $150/night, which included vallet parking.

<Content>Excellent location, brilliant room and friendly staff We stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for 10 nights from 30th April. We had no problems checking in, they had given us a room with twin beds as requested on the 8th floor. The size of the rooms has been moaned about here but the room was not too big, not too small. Our room was cleaned every day and sheets changed too. I cannot fault the cleanliness of the hotel at all - the maids did a great job and were very friendly too! Location wise this is just the best you can get - slap bang in the middle of shopping, restaurants and transportation. Some people have commented on the noise if you are at the front of the hotel and open your window. We hardly noticed the noise at all and to hear the cable car bells as they go by only adds to your experience of San Francisco in my opinion.Upon ckecking in you are handed some leaflets detailing tours that they can book for you - we went on the Muir Woods and Sausilito tour which I would definitely recommend. A coach picked us up from the hotel and dropped us back 4 hours later after seeing some great sights.They have a computer in reception which offers free internet access which is brilliant - most hotels charge the earth for this! They also offer free coffee, tea, cookies and popcorn :)We would have no qualms in recommending this hotel to anyone who wants a clean, friendly hotel in the centre of the city. Enjoy!

What a great location. The rooms were small by U.S. standards, and I'm glad it wasn't hot (no air conditioning). My best friend and I shared a room with twin beds and were quite comfortable. Hotel was clean and nice.The hotel staff was VERY friendly and helpful. On the Thursday evening of our visit, there was a manager's reception, with beer/wine and very tasty hors d'oevres.To top things off, we all LOVED the rubber ducky in the bathrooms. Would definitely stay here again.DON'T MISS Sears Restaurant - right next door. GREAT breakfast.

<Content>A fine hotel We opted for the cruise special - $160 per room per night (not currently available on their website but similar to their current Summer Value Package). We stayed 2 nights (May 11- May 13) before flying back to boring England (nobody ever left their heart there).There was a mix-up involving our pick-up from the Cruise Terminal which was quickly resolved. A compensatory bottle of wine was waiting for us in our room. We thought this was rather generous - unneccessary but very kind all the same. The breakfast component of the bread and breakfast package (and I don't believe this was made clear on the website) was worth $14 (as is now clearly stated on the Summer Value Package). This, in contrast, we thought was rather cheap as $7 per person wouldn't buy much at all (three quarters of a blueberry omelette, I think). After a quick chat with the front desk, this was upgraded to $28 which is sufficient for two people to indulge in one of their four (very tasty) breakfast packages (e.g. juice, tea/coffee, toast, vegetable omelette) valued at $12-13 approx.So my only suggestion to the management is to do likewise - change your current and future packages from a $14 per room restaurant allowance to (a more realistic) $28.Note: In the UK, bed and breakfast for any class of hotel has no such restrictions.This would be our only criticism of a deservedly top-notch hotel.Previous reviews correctly report on the myriad positives - Great location, excellent front desk, excellent tour desk, excellent rooms......in fact, excellent everything.

<Content>Great 5 day stay I was very pleasently surprised with the service of this hotel. They do a lot of little things that show they care about their guests. The hotel is old but kept up very well. The Wireless Internet service works great but if you don't have a computer they also have one available by the front desk for guests to use. The bathrooms are a little small and I felt that it could have been a little cleaner but I consider myself to have very high standards when it comes to how clean the bathrooms are. We stayed one night at the Downtown Hilton during this visit and would pick the Chancellor over the Hiton any day.

Ask for a room on a high floor and facing away from the street.Cable car stops right outside. Macy's store right opposite. Breakfast good.

<Content>Perfect place to stay My wife and I stayed at the Chancellor for 10 nights. Before I left, I emailed Wes telling him that this was a belated honeymoon stay and asked for a nice room with a good view. We weren't disappointed with the room we were given. Also found a nice gift had been left in the room for us which was much appreciated!The staff were always curteous and helpful. The location couldn't have been better and the information desk ran by Susan was a bonus as you can get everything including advice, cable car passes and stamps for postcards! The restaurant and bar at the hotel was very convenient and we had breakfast there once. Unfortunately we didn't know that we had been given a card with credit on (it had been left in the room for us when we arrived and didn't know what it was for until we checked out).The rooms were reasonably sized and very clean (very important for us). I don't know why people have complained about the size of the rooms in previous rooms OR the noise! If you want a central location, of course you are going to hear a bit of activity outside. Having said this, we weren't disturbed by it at all. It was so convenient to be able to pop out in the evening for a late snack.We also hired a car for the weekend and because of the great location of the hotel, only had to walk a couple of blocks to get to hire car companies. Also, the cable car lines run right past the hotel which is very very convenient!This pretty much confirms what most people have been saying about this hotel. It is not one to be missed at such an affordable price.Overall, a big thankyou to Wes and his staff. I would definitely stay there again and would most certainly recommend this place to others visiting San Francisco!

<Content>The Chancellor is the best We just returned from a 5 day trip to San Francisco and the Chancellor and we echo the comments made by almost 100% of the respondents here:1) The Chancellor is perfectly situated: it sits in the absolutely BEST area of SF. Close to the cable line, Union Square and ideally situated in the middle of anywhere you want to be. 2) The staff at the Chancellor ARE the BEST. We ask a lot of questions and these guys (and gals) never tired of answering us. They actually seemed to love providing data on how to catch various bus/cable car/street car lines, good restuarants, etc.3) The Hotel is awesome. We loved all the things other people mentioned like extra deep tubs (especially after walking all day).4) Loved the cookies 24 hours a day, the decaf, regular coffee and tea, as well as apples.5) I walked for blocks in every direction around Union Square...I checked out every hotel. Chancellor is the best...hands down. Oh, there may have been fancier places...but they felt so...cold. The Chancellor did just what we wanted it to: it made us feel like we were part of the San Francisco family.And our time there was in a word...wonderful.Thomas

<Content>Frustrating stay -- Not bad, not great. My boyfriend and I visited for three nights at the end of March. While we enjoyed our visit and thought that the Chancellor was certainly a value, there are a couple things I would warn fellow travellers about:If you are a light sleeper, request a room that isn't adjoining with another one (doesn't have a door in between). We had a couple with a very small child next door to us, and we could hear every noise that the baby made, including when it started shrieking at 3 in the morning. I realize that it is an old building and so might have thin walls, but the noise was unbearable. We called down the desk to see if we could switch rooms, but were told that since it was past 10 o'clock there was no way we could switch because there were no other rooms made up. This seemed unnecessary -- why wouldn't you have rooms made up in case guests need to switch or a guest wanted to check-in late at night? And how were we supposed to know that it would be too loud to sleep until we had actually tried to go to bed? They also claimed to have white noise machines available, but one was lent out and the other was broken.We did end up switching rooms after a night of bad sleep, but the whole thing was a hassle and extremely frustrating. The second room was much much quieter (no adjoining room). The rooms were decently sized, bigger than what I expected after reading reviews. The pillows that came with the room were horrible, but that was remedied by calling down to the front desk and ordering off of the pillow menu. All in all, it seemed like the hotel could have spent more effort on getting the little things right in the first place and less on luxury add-ons that just seemed out of place (the pillow menu, or the spa menu in the bathroom). Also be warned that the location of the hotel is right on Union Square, and while that might be great for those who are visiting the city for the first time, I wouldn't stay in that exact area again. Everything around the hotel is extremely touristy, which makes it hard to do things like grabbing breakfast or drinks quickly and cheaply. It's a good place from which to see the city for the first time, but the whole cable car/giant chain stores/lots of homeless people/bad food thing gets old pretty quickly. (I realize that's not the Chancellor's fault, but the area in general).I also find it kind of odd that the hotel comes on here and defends itself rather than letting guests critique their stay fairly -- it's intimidating and I would keep that in mind as a potential guest reading these reviews.

<Content>Loved The Chancellor!! Took the reccomendations of this site and booked the Chancellor for 3 nights in April. Loved it! My 16 yo daughter loved its character. Is very central to many places/ares/transportation. Nothing fancy, but very clean and functional. two single beds were perfect for my daughter and I. They were more than helpful for anything we needed. Concerns about the homeless in the area: had no trouble at all; most are very friendly.We had no problems at all with any noise, other than the occasional sirens heard outside open window at night. We were there on a perticularly warm day...upper 70s...but room never was too warm at night. Highly reccomend!!!!

<Content>Excellent The hotel is really confortable, and quiet , though it is centally located on Union square netx to Border library. The people working in the hotel is really excellent. Tip: If you rent a car, buy room with parking valet, because it is really difficult to park in this area and it is very expensive. (if you are car-less the cable car stop is just in the front of the hotel.From our room on 15th floor we had an amazing view toward union square. The room standard is really high:you can have free up to 15 kind of pillow, radio clock, iron, iron table, cable tv, and wireless internet access, and moreover a small gum duck for bathing :)

<Content>Charming hotel in excellent location I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel while on vacation in the Bay Area, and I was very impressed. The location, room rate, services, staff, and the cookies available in the lobby were great! My room was spotless, and although I was apprehensive about noise when I first opened the door to my room (I had one on the front), I found that the windows a very good job of soundproofing (basically all I could really hear was the cable car bells).The hotel is right on the cable car line and about 10 seconds walk from Union Square, so the location cannot be beat if you want to be near shops, cable car, good restaurants, and a lot of the theatres. Parking is close by and works well (you drop off your car in the parking garage and it's parked for you). I have to say that I researched various places quite carefully prior to booking at the Chancellor (actually I spent about two hours looking at various places, with a wide range in price). What tipped the balance in favour of the Chancellor is that the general manager has taken the time to actually respond to comments on this web site: I felt that the service and general level of attention would be better than elsewhere, given that he is obviously concerned about how his hotel is perceived. And I was right. I'd recommend this hotel, especially for first-time visitors to San Francisco.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel with so many extra's! Just got home from our trip ~we stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for 5 Nights! The location is outstanding we loved having the cable cars right outside our door and some very nice restaurants makes it even better! Our stay in the hotel was great upon check in we were early and so the front desk staff took our bags as we ate in Luques Restaurant in the hotel, great food and service and very comfortable! By the time we were done eating the staff indicated to us that our room is ready if we would like to go freshen up, which we did! We were on the 11th floor corner view of Union Sq. it was beautiful! Our room was as expected from previous posters we enjoyed the tall ceiling/architecture and large bathtub the beautiful drapes (as some other posters mentioned the bedspread was worn, BUT that did not interfer with our stay). Prior to booking our stay I had personally contacted Mr. Wes Tyler the Hotel Manager and mentioned to him it was our 25th Ann. and on arrival we had a bottle of sparkling wine, a some extras! LIKE that is going above and beyond! All the extra's like the candy jar, pillow menu, coffee/teas in lobby and the fruit was an added bonus! We were hardly in our rooms but we slept very well on the white crisp sheets did not find it warm in our room at all and no noise! Suzie at the tour desk was very helpful (I wished I had not booked our tours online as she was very knowledgable. All in all we had a great time, so many laughs and we will return without a doubt  will book at the Chancellor hotel great value great location! Thanks for all the memories! OH the weather was outstanding for the whole week!

<Content>Great stay Very happy with our stay here in April 2006. Check-in was efficient and room was nice - and it was nice to have free tea/coffee and a bath after a 12-hour flight! The room was perfectly adequate in size- have read some comments here about that but these people must either have unrealistic expectations or spend way to much holiday/vacation time in their rooms!The location is perfect; from SFO airport the train (BART) takes you directly to Powell Street, from which the hotel is about 3 blocks north. You're in the heart of the shopping and commercial district, within an easy walk of North Beach and Chinatown, you can take the cablecar to the waterfront from right outside the hotel (though if you can't get on, walk back to Market Street and there are frequent trams (streetcars) to Fisherman's Wharf). You walk down to Powell St station to get trams (streetcars), metro or BART to anywhere else in the city or bay area and there are buses nearby (eg 15 to North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf a few blocks east).If you just want a ride on a cablecar but can't get on the ones to/from Fisherman's Wharf (they are VERY busy) either go out very early or late in the evening, or you can get on the California Street one whenever you like as this doesn't serve the main touristy area, and runs close to the hotel (albeit up a hill!).

<Content>Grim Stayed for 4 nights with my 14yr old son first week in April. Location is great for shops and cable cars run right past the hotel. Breakfast was fairly poor so we used some of the local eateries. Room was a bit on the small side and at the back of the hotel. Because it was on one of the lower floors we had to put up with the A/C units going on and off throughout the night on the low level rooftop outside of our room, sound insulation was pretty poor. All in all I wouldn't stay there again, and I'm generally not too fussy.

<Content>Great value  Stayed here for four nights. Apart from the weather, which turned rotten just before we arrived in SF, it was a great stay. The hotel is just off Union Sq, but not enough to say it's off Union Sq...if that makes sense! Anyway, rooms are typical good budget hotel, good size, clean, everything you'd need in the bathroom etc. But don't stay here is you are planning on lounging around in the room/watching films  orderning room service. It's not plush - it's very good value for money, and in a great location. Only issue was with the check-in staff who were beyond rude. Asked them if they might have a UK nokia charger (left behind by previous guest...most hotels have boxes of phone chargers) and was told 'no' straight off by the lady, without her even thinking about it....I pressed her..and she said she'd check with housekeeping...and rang up the room to say 'no'....just utterly rude...and while I was asking the other checking lady was looking at me like I had two heads! Luckily didn't have to deal with them until I was checking out!

<Content>Best Value in Town It is a bit difficult to rate this hotel, because one wants to make sure the traveler is not expecting something luxurious. This hotel is not fancy, but it has everything you need and should save you money if you get an on-line deal like I did. I stayed for four nights at $125/night, and that came with a gift card worth $28 for the restaurant. I also got a 20%-off coupon for the restaurant for when my gift card ran out. The lobby is attractive (contrary to what one reviewer thought), with oversized, comfortable couches for seating (Anyway, just look at the hotel's photos, that's how it looks.) The restaurant is very nice, and the food is very good. I did not have lunch there, but the breakfast was great -- much more variety and better food than I expected. My room was number 604, and it looked a lot like the one pictured in the other traveler's candid photos. The walls were off-white, and there were two pictures that were attractive. The window treatments were lovely. The paint was clean and fresh-looking everywhere. There was a huge, walk-in closet with plenty of wooden hangers and two large, metal luggage racks. The closet would probably help to make up for the smallness of the room for a couple staying for an extended period. As a single traveler staying for a few days, I did not find the room to be especially small. Shampoo, conditioner, kleenex, bath salts, shower cap, soap, and hair dryer (and appropriate outlets) were supplied. The soaps were nice -- glycerine for hands and face, and a thick round cake for the bath -- the same as in fancier hotels. New soap was delivered when I didn't even need it. The towels were bright white, and the bath towels were thick. The bathroom was immaculate, and everything worked really well. There was a swing-arm, magnifying mirror, and the bathroom could be lighted by an overhead, incandescent fixture, or a fluorescent one over the large mirror. One feature I really appreciated was the massaging shower head. The bathtub was very deep, and the guest was offered various spa ammenities at additional cost. The closet door featured a full-length mirror. There was free wireless everywhere, and free internet in the lobby (It was pretty popular.) There was an iron and ironing board, a free in-room safe, and an umbrella for use during my stay. Several different complimentary newspapers were available in the lobby, as were coffee, cookies, and apples. The heat in my room worked very well. The large window could be opened, and there was a ceiling fan over the bed. My room had a noise (like a din) coming from outside, but it did not disturb my sleep. My room was not on the street side. The carpeting was nice. My bed felt comfortable to me. Room service was available, but I did not use it. The room type that I had really does not make a great first impression, but I think it could easily have been made more appealing -- different bedspread and fabric on the chairs perhaps. I notice the suites have light fabrics on the beds and chairs, and this looks prettier. (A room decorated like the one I stayed in is pictured on the website, though, so there should be no reason for complaints.) I was not crazy about the dark wood on doors and elevators -- that may have contributed to the few negative reviews about appearance -- but perhaps that is part of the historic ambiance. There was no mini-bar, but there are Walgreens everywhere, and the one closest to the hotel is open 24 hours if snacks and drinks are needed -- and, of course, that is usually preferable to paying exhorbitant prices for such things in a hotel room. The reviewer who thought you could get a better room for the price was wrong. The location cannot be beat, and the ammenities are truly fine. I was staying with colleagues for a conference, and I boasted of many perqs that their much more expensive rooms did not offer. The TV was certainly large enough, and the reception was perfect. I had little need for the staff, but when the public-access printer had no toner and I wanted to print out my boarding pass, one clerk was most helpful in a joint quest for a solution (I should have asked his name, actually.) I would not choose this hotel for my honeymoon, but it is perfect for travelers wanting to stay in a safe, picturesque area and have money left over for nice dinners and events rather than spending it on trappings they will spend little time admiring.

Quiet room with a view (13th floor). Bed was comfortable and the umbrella in the room was a god-send! Free local phone calls and use of business centre for internet was appreciated. The complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning even tasted like coffee -- a nice change! It was very convenient to be able to get a daily transit pass for cable cars and MUNI right in the lobby. Highly recommended. Will definitely return.

Who could ask for anything more? While I was sorry I didn't have the opportunity to meet the famous (and very funny on this site) Wes Tyler, the rest of the staff was great. We ate breakfast everyday at the hotel and found the avocado omelet to be YUMMY. San Fran is great, I highly recommend the tour of wine country. It was fabulous and I learned alot to impress my friends..haha Thank you Chancellor Hotel for the wonderful stay in San Francisco! We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else!

<Content>Wonderful hotel My wife and I loved the Chancellor. We selected it on the basis of the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and the fact that it was the only hotel where the manager made a point of answering the few bad reviews. We thought this would be a well managed hotel. We were not disappointed, the room was perfect, the service wonderful in all categories and the location in the very heart of the city extraordinarily convenient. This hotel is truly a very well managed operation and we highly recommend it. Other guests to whom we spoke shared our point of view.

<Content>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Wow! After researching hotels for months on different travel sites, including TripAdvisor, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to stay at the Chancellor Hotel. I'd been to San Francisco about 10 times in the past and had only repeated hotels once...never having found the perfect hotel for the greatest price in the best location.I search no more.After a short series of emails with Wes Tyler, the GM of The Chancellor, I was offered a deal too good to refuse. The occassion was my boyfriend's birthday and his first trip to the Bay -- and we were not disappointed by the accommodations with which Wes set us up! The Romance Suite on the top (15th) floor, corner room which included a separate living area with couch, desk, table and chair, TWO bathrooms (very handy for us ladies!), a gorgeous cast iron canopied very comfortable bed with quality linens, plenty of seating, a fan which cooled the room plenty, great toiletries, walk-in closet, free candy, a small refrigerator for leftovers or drinks, plenty of tourbooks, and a working window with a fire escape with which to take amazing views of Union Sqaure and the Bay! Whew! We were also treated to champagne by Wes, which was truly appreciated.The front desk staff was quick and friendly. Checking in and out was a breeze. The 24-hour supply of coffee was very much appreciated (tea, too) and the cookies were a nice treat. Location -- can't be beat. Next to Sears Fine Foods (a touristy but fine breakfast spot), steps from the cable car stop, across the street from a great restaurant named Scala's Bistro, a block away from Union Square, three blocks away from HM (clothes paradise), and four blocks away from the subway (and bus lines) from both SFO and Oakland. I can't think of a better mix of quality, cost-effectiveness, location and just plain coolness than The Chancellor. Many thanks to Wes and staff! We'll be back again soon!

<Content>A+ The Chancellor gets an A+ from me. It is apparent that the hotel is well-managed in every detail, and has a staff that knows their jobs and cares about making you feel like you're a welcome guest. In the lobby there is a plaque with a picture of several employees that had been there for 25 years. I chose a room in the front because I wanted to be able to open the window to let in the fresh air and to hear the sounds of the city below. There is a diagonal view of beautiful and bustling Union Sq. With the double-paned window shut, it was quiet except perhaps for the squeaking cable cars. I loved sitting in the arm chair and table near the window and enjoying the free newspapers and coffee and cookies in the morning. I also took advantage of the free access to the modern health club and pool around the corner. The parking garage, one street away, was quick and easy. I had a great 11-day stay at the Chancellor.San Francisco is one of the most unique and beautiful cities in the world. In addition to all the outstanding tourist attractions, shopping and restaurants you see in the brochures, the whole city is an attraction. The waterfront is unspoiled and spectacular, especially the views from the walkways along the Marina, where there is plenty of parking space. You can explore the neighborhoods on BART, the Muni, the buses, or the wonderful antique street cars, whimsically gathered from all over the world, that run along Market Street. Enjoy.

<Content>Great Value This may be the best value in the US for a hotel in the tourist center of a tourist city. The Chancellor has a 1920s feel. The rooms are nothing fancy and on the smaller side, but they have a lot of character. The bathroom, for instance, has a real high-sided tub with shower, not a modern shower. If you want luxurious and up to date, best go elsewhere.If you like an older feel and want value, this is the perfect hotel. I booked online and paid $89 (pretax) for my room-- not a special rate. The room had a partial view of Union Square. The wireless access was free-- I was on business and this was very useful. The hotel has an arrangement with a neighbor health club for free use. The staff was friendly and helpful. Everything was clean and well-kept. If I had paid $200 a night, I would have been satisfied. I was almost a little fearful of what I would get for the price, but wow...

<Content>Wonderul Location, Wonderful staff This hotel is on the cable car line with stops just outside the door. The ride to Fisherman's Wharf is about 15 minutes and great fun. The hotel is across the street from high end shopping and within walking distance of some great restaurants. The staff was wonderful, they did everything possible to make sure our stay was enjoyable. I have two less than wonderful comments: 1. Our room, 1208, was in need of updating; sad carpeting and bedding. 2. Our room was not air conditioned. This was not a problem since temperatures were mild and we left windows open. However, even on the 12th floor, street noise often was distracting. That said, though small and dated, the room was clean with nice toiletries and two comfy chairs. We would definitely stay there again.

The location is superb, the rates are excellent, the staff was friendly, nice and courteous and the rooms were clean (yes, and small). We stayed on the back side of the hotel, no view, but quiet!

<Content>Reminds me of a sultry dorm room I only stayed here for one night as a vacation day before a business trip. Since my company wasn't paying for the hotel on my day off, I choose to use a discount hotel website that doesn't tell you the name of the hotel before booking. Basically, it is a place to sleep that is indoors. I'm 6'5 and the bed is 5'10. The TV is the exact version my 87 year old grandpa has, except smaller. On a bright note, they had free cookies at the front desk - on a sad note, they were not good. The bathroom is clean, which is always a good thing. The room itself is very small - it reminds me of my dorm room from college, except with uglier carpet. That's about all.

<Content>We shall return! My husband and I just returned from spending our entire vacation week at the Chancellor. Yes, when we first walked into the room, it seemed small. But of course I've read everything on tripadvisor and we expected that. It would have been small, had we brought kids with us and tried to put a cot in there. But for the two of us, who used the room for a late-afternoon rest each day and then for sleeping each night, it was just perfect. The walk-in closet and drawer space meant we could truly unpack and get rid of our suitcases. The bathroom had plenty of shelving and great supplies. The tub was big enough for 2 to soak in. Plenty of hot water, and everything in the room and bathroom was very clean and pleasant.We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, offering good suggestions when we asked about restaurants and showing us exactly which buses would take us where. In a week, we never had to take a cab, and we explored every neighborhood in the city.We had specifically asked for a high floor, overlooking Union Square, and that is exactly what we got. We were blessed with warm, beautiful weather all week and had our room and bathroom windows open a few inches the entire time. There is also an overhead fan to help cool the room down when the sun streams in. The two elevators are new, very quiet, very fast...just excellent. We never heard a peep from our neighbors. If street noises bother you, just bring some of those little foam earplugs. Or walk a few steps up the block and get some at Walgreens.There are complimentary copies of the SF Chronicle, NYTimes and USA Today in the lobby each morning. Excellent coffee and tea, and always some cookies and fruit there for the taking at all times. Freshly popped popcorn many afternoons. Problem-free wi-fi in the rooms or in the lobby, free local phone calls...all these little things added to the comfort and economy of our visit.The best restaurants are NOT in Union Square, but half the fun of being there is venturing out to other areas and finding new favorites. We found the absolute best breakfast in San Francisco several blocks away. The hotel's breakfast is very tasty too.We can't imagine paying two or three times as much for a more modern (sterile) room in another hotel. Give the Chancellor a try!

We had a corner room, which I think may be a little larger, and found it to be very nice with a view toward Union Square. We were able to watch the Chinese New Years parade from our window. The hotel is very convenient to all the tourist locations and the cable car runs right outside the hotel. We walked to Chinatown easily and there are lots of restaurants and shopping within a few blocks of the hotel. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. All in all, a very good value for the price.

<Content>great hotel We read all the reviews before going to SF and decided to stay at the Chancellor Hotel. The reviews were all correct. Could not ask for a better spot. would stay there next trip. It was great to step out the front door and hop on the cable car.

<Content>A True Gem in the Heart of San Fran The Chancellor Hotel is a wonderful hotel. Its location is fabulous - right on the Powell Street Cable Car Line and in the heart of Union Square, and its easy to get to all San Fran has to offer. The Staff are excellent and bend over backwards to help you in any way they can. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated and a pillow menu is even offered to guests!! I felt very welcolme and comfortable in the Chancellor and recommend it to everyone visiting San Fransisco.

<Content>Great stay! I had e-mailed Mr. Tyler prior to our trip telling him that my boyfriend was flying in from Hawaii to visit my family and I for the holidays. We took a one night getaway to the city and Mr. Tyler had pre-assigned us to a corner room on the top floor and had champagne waiting for us along with a card! The staff was very accomodating (we checked in a little early) and the room was very roomy for a hotel right in Union Square. I didn't think the bathtub was as small as other people had written in other reviews... we quite liked it and the rubber duck was a cute touch. =) The Chancellor Hotel is in a perfect location and we would definitely stay there again! Next time, we hope to stay longer than one night!

<Content>location great, but not a destination hotel We booked the Chancellor based on the rave reviews on this site; we were similarly enthralled by the location, but not terribly excited by anything else. The plumbing was loud, the room was tiny, the window opened onto a metal maze of a fire escape, the umbrella broke as soon as we opened it, and the lobby bar was the least appealing place in the city. Stay here if you want a central location and don't plan to spend much time in the room, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.

<Content>Great deal, great location, great staff, etc. We spent five days at the Chancellor in early January of 2006. The location is fabulous, and the rooms, while not large, are certainly adequate (I've stayed in smaller ones nearby). It is modestly priced for the area, but has comfortable beds, and some nice amenities (multiple pillow choices for example, a room safe, hard candy in jars, wi-fi in room, to name a few). The staff was very accomodating (at arranging cabs, etc., or in helping me figure out how to connect to their wi-fi). There is a cozy bar that's open until about 9 or 10. Coffee and cookies are pretty much available all the time.We didn't eat in the restaurant, but there are lots of great places to eat at most price ranges nearby.I've stayed in four hotels in that area in recent years,and this is the best combination of comfort and value. It is not airconditioned, which is pointed out in the materials, but there are ceiling fans and windows that open to allow the almost always cool SF air in if you are hot-natured. When windows are open,the sounds of the city come in, which I found soothing, but tastes differ on that. When the windows are closed, its amazingly quiet to be on such a busy street. All in all, we highly recommend it, and hope to go back.

<Content>Great base for San Francisco We stayed at the Chancellor hotel for the second time and as people say the location is brilliant. The best of the hotels of this price range on Union Square. Actually what I like the most about this hotel is that you don't feel like a number like you do with a lot of experiences in the US. There are the sound issues, you have to know that before going in.I love the location right next door to Borders bookshop which is open till 11pm at night unlike in New Zealand where we live, and the shops close at 5.30pm! I go into the book shop after dinner and browse the great range of travel books on San Francisco. If you are a shopaholic you have to get the Frommers book by Suzy Gershman's Born to Shop San Francisco. She has a lot of tips also about getting around SF and which neighbourhoods to visit for great shopping, like Fillmore St. If you are going to SF get a room at the Chancellor, it will save you the money which you can spend on getting around by taxi to some of the great places to see just outside the centre!

<Content>You can't argue with value like that. We stayed at the Chancellor hotel after originally choosing another hotel but after reading reviews of the Chancellor we changed our booking and we were not dissapointed. It is everything it claims to be and the reviews we read were spot on. Excellent location, price, friendly helpful staff and comfortable rooms and best of all as much tea as you can drink! I particularly liked the christmas decoration of a scale model of the hotel in the lobby made out of breakfast cereal and other interesting food stuffs. Believe the reviews and stay at the Chancellor it's absolutely worth it.

<Content>Excellent hotel, Great location We stayed at the Chancellor for five nights and it was great. The location is incredible, the boutique-stores, restaurants and Union square itself are just a few steps from the hotel. Our room was well equiped with all things you may need during your staying and the staff was friendly all the time starting with Erica at the front desk. We hope to return soon to San Francisco and of course our election will be the Chancellor.

<Content>We'll be back to stay at the Chancellor every single time. The Chancellor was perfect for us. We had read about the sound issues people had had, and requested a quiet room. Unfortunately we got a corner rear room that while providing a decent view of Union Square also allowed some of the street traffic noise to make it's way up 13 floors. No worries though prepared with ear plugs sleep was not a problem. We didn't notice any problem with the bathrooms, and quite enjoyed the hallway of a closet that the corner room provided (our traveling companions got the adjoining room and we found their closet to be much smaller). We loved the coffee that was provided pretty much around the clock, we must have saved $50 not having to buy coffee a couple times a day. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the Bartender offered some great tips for New Years eve. Although we ended up back at the hotel bar pretty much every night. (Great prices on the half bottles of wine!!) Biggest selling point for us though convenience! My wife is/was 6 months pregnant and not in the mood for walking miles and miles. She is also an admitted shop-a-holic, the location of the Chancellor and the price allowed her to spend hours shopping with out having to walk more than 2 minutes or so to get to her first shopping center. After picking up a Map from Macy's that listed all the shopping in the area she was able to spend 2 whole days shopping and never be more than 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and a bed/restroom to recoup. This close proximity also allowed me multiple options as far as bars to watch the bowl games. Stop by and check out Union Square sports bar a few blocks down the road as well as the Mediterranean restaurant next store. Both excellent choices.

The little touches meant a lot including the chocolate chip cookies, the rubber ducky and the candy jar. It has a great location on Union Square. I would recommend to others.

<Content>San Fran Chancellor Hotel The location of the Chancellor was pretty much in the center of San Fran. You must call for your car as the parking is tight. When you needed your car, they would bring it in 10 minutes. There were restaurants in walking distance, and many stores if you wanted to shop. China Town was a couple blocks behind the hotel. Take the cable cars as the streets were steep all over, or taxi, etc. The rooms had European decor, very comfortable beds  pillows. Extra blankets if needed. Old style hotel where they take your luggage to your room. There was a restaurant in the hotel, and the food was delicious. Cookies  fruit were always in the lobby for a quick snack, and magazines to read. It was quiet, and the bath tub was huge with shower. Everything was there that you needed. I would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Excellent hotel in fabulous location This is a comfortable, clean and affordable boutique hotel just off Union Square. It is an excellent location for tourists as the cable car runs from union square, there are loads of buses on nearby market street and powell street BART is a 5 min walk. Also plenty of shops and restarants just outside the hotel. We asked for a quiet room beforehand so had no problem with noise. there is always hot tea and coffee available.This is the hotel to be in if you want to be in a central location close to public transport.We spent 5 nights here and I'd go back without a doubt.

<Content>Good value, excellent location Excellent location - 0.5 block from union square, right on the powell st cable car line, a few blocks from powell st BART/MUNI station.Rooms are not huge, but for a city centre hotel they're certainly acceptable. As noted in other reviews, the bathrooms are quite small compared to some places - full bath with shower over, basin and WC, and enough room to stand two people if they're quite friendly! - but the hot water was plentiful and the shower powerful. I don't go on holiday to stay in the bathroom, so the size doesn't matter much!Furnishings in the room were in good condition, bed was comfortable, all electrics worked and room was clean. Housekeeping staff were quietly efficient.Modern amenities are provided within the constraints of what is clearly a historic building; there's a modern TV with video on demand, free WiFi, room safe, ironing board etc. But a ceiling fan instad of aircon (I guess aircon is not an issue given the SF climate?) and no coffee making in the room (available in lobby, or in Borders bookstore next door)

<Content>Fantastic Experience We stayed at the Chancellors for a week in September -I'd chosen it after reading reviews on here and was NOT disappointed.The place is small - the rooms are small and there isn't much of a view, but its advertised as a boutique hotel, with small rooms and charm. It certainly has bags and bags of character. The staff can't do enough for you, especially in the bar where they showed genuine interest in our day, recommended restaurants and routes and helped us try out a few new cocktails. You can use the internet for a dollar for as long as you want if nobody else is waiting. There is coffee available all day for the jetlagged to wander down and collect at 5am if they can't sleep. The free cookies tasted fab, loved the rubber duck in the bath and the pillow menu. The foot spa rental after a day of sightseeing is inspired.In summary, don't go for luxury - its clean, functional, quirky, comfortable but, for me, the friendliness of all the staff and the ability to pop back in the afternoons for a rest and a free cuppa, plus the wonderfully central location made this a bargain gem and really made our holiday.

<Content>When inexpensive means tacky If you can climb the streets of San Francisco and then spend the evening with no way to even heat water for tea, much less have coffee, then be the Chancellor's guest. I requested a microwave, and the dead-pan answer was that they had coffee and hot water 24 hours a day in the lobby. Not good. And the notes from others about no climate control should be taken seriously. Chancellor will respond that the windows can be opened. My window jammed when I locked it to get some safety from the antiquated fire escape, and I called immediately for someone to come and free the lock. When I check out the next morning, the lock was still jammed. Staff attitudes are questionable: chambermaids friendly enough. Desk staff, bartender, appear as if trained to avoid eye contact, and not even return smiles, much less originate them.

<Content>Bang "in the middle" for your Buck We stayed at the Chancellor for 4 nights from 11 Nov 2005.Booked on the net 3 months before travelling out, we checked in no problems and our requested lower level floor with a Union Square view was satisfied.The room was clean and tidy with plenty of storage, bed was very comfortable and bathroom was small but very functional great deep bath and powerful shower with a rubber duck to keep you amused!I found all the staff to be very friendly and knowledgeable, a real non-chain appeal permeated throughout our stay.The bar in the lobby was very layed back and friendly with a good selection of Californian wine and plenty of beers and spirits, free nuts and pretzels on request along with a couple of plasma TV's showing the latest news and sports. The bar area was being renovated whilst we checked out (mid Nov 2005).The Chancellors location cannot be faulted for visitors wanting to stay in the heart of San Francisco within 5 mins of all the main shops and cable car stop.There's a choice of at least 3 restaurants within 30 seconds walk of the front door, handy when you've had a tiring jet-lagged day sightseeing.Taxi fare to and from SFO international was about $40 including the tip.As for visitor tips - there's one I would definately recommend. Buy a MUNI Passport ticket to cover your stay. If you're in town for 5 days buy a 7 day ticket, believe me you'll save money!!Example: 2 people making 2 return trips on a cable car in one day would cost $40 ($5 each single trip); buy a 1 day MUNI Passport for $11 each and that covers your trips plus you can use it on buses and the tramcar along Market St.Wish I got one on our 1st day !!This would only apply to overseas visitors but one thing that we thought was a bit annoying upon check out was that our credit card was already charged before we had agreed the bill. This meant that a refund of a service back to our card was made in US dollars which the card company make a charge for to convert back to your currency, so if they inadvertantly charge for something you didnt use or buy then you are out of pocket anyway.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a stay here - I would definately book again for the nice atmos and the very central location.

<Content>What a Find! We stayed four nights in the wonderful Chancellor Hotel. When we arrived, we found an attractive and clean room with a candy dish full of candy that was restocked daily; a pillow menu with choice of pillows; cookies, tea, and coffee available all the time in the lobby; and a location that couldn't have been any better (cable car stop right outside the front door and surrounded by a veritable shopper's paradise). We did have a problem with the bathroom. We are large people and the toilet was so close to the wall that we couldn't sit on it comfortably. When we inquired about the possibility of changing rooms, we were soon moved to another room that had just enough extra space to make it workable. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and actually moved all our suitcases to our new room while we were out sightseeing! We ate breakfast one morning in the restaurant in the hotel--excellent food, friendly wait staff, and reasonable prices. Next time we go to San Francisco, we definitely plan to stay at the Chancellor!

<Content>Good Staff/Location/Value, Average Room, Stuffy We just got back from a one night stay at the Chancellor Hotel on Union Square. We live about an hour away and came into town for a party in the city and didn't want to drive home. Here are my general thoughts - both good and bad.The Good1. Kudos to management for coming here and reading and responding to the comments on this site. I think that says a lot for the management and, regardless of what else I say here, they are to be commended.2. The Chancellor is in a great location in San Francisco and is a good value for the money. The bed was comfortable and the room, while somewhat small, was clean and fine for our purposes.3. The staff was very friendly and professional.The Bad1. There is nothing management can do about this, but be advised that the bathrooms are really small. They have a deep tub, which *is* a nice touch, but there is really only room for one person in the bathroom at a time. The pictures posted on this site are accurate. 2. In the case of the rooms facing Union Square, the lack of air conditioning was a real issue for us. Granted this is San Francisco, and it rarely gets ridiculously hot, but here is the dillemna: We were on the 13th floor facing the street. More quiet than the lower floors I would imagine, but there is still plenty of street noise. So you can keep the window closed, but then the room gets really, really stuffy and the ceiling fan just doesn't do enough to rectify that problem. You COULD open the window, but it is on the fire escape so there is a potential stranger access / safety issue that is not unreasonable in a major city. There *is* a little bolt to hold it closed, but it is not big enough to allow any real air in the room. EVEN if you did either the full open window or the small latched opening, it would be useless as you would have to open up the blinds to let the air in...and there is a huge Harry Denton's Starlight Lounge neon sign directly opposite the higher floors and flashing outside all night long. So you have to choose between stuffiness (which is made worse by the smallness of the room/shower and the warmth of that filling up the room) and the neon light flashing in your room all night long. My wife and I both woke up due to the warm stuffiness in the room several times throughout the night.There it is...warts and all. I think that the Chancellor is a good value hotel in a great location with a good staff and responsive management and would recommend it with the caveats listed above. There are nicer places to stay in SF, but not at this price in this location. By the way, some people we know stayed at the Mosser 1/3 mile away. YECHHH!

<Content>very nice Great location and very nice hotel! We had a great time using the Chancellor as our base for 2 days in San Francisco. The staff was helpful and the room was small but nice. We stayed on the 14th floor, looking for a quieter space with this hotel being on Powell St and the Cable Car line. We found it noisy during the day - but who cares. We slept with the window open at night and found it to be quiet enough. Oh, and the pillows were very nice. I'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>terrific value, great location, highly recommended We stayed for 7 nights in mid-September 2005  had a great holiday. We picked the Chancellor based on Tripadvisor reviews (no other hotel nearby could offer the same good value combined with great reviews)  for the location, and we were not disappointed. I booked by contacting the hotel direct, months earlier,  got a confirmation e-mail shortly afterwards. My requests for a quiet room, facing the back, high-up, with no connecting doors were met (the only noise we had was a loud radio or TV one evening, but it stopped before we went to bed). The view at the back of the hotel was still quite striking, especially at night. Hotel itself has some character, with a beautiful art-deco type mirror behind the bar. Lifts were effective; we did use the stairs a few times, but 15 floors is along way! The room was quite big enough and (like Wes, the manager, whose responses on Tripadvisor are highly entertaining) I found it no problem using the toilet ! No A/C needed - ceiling fan was only needed a couple of times, and we left our windows open during the day. Room was very clean; the shower very effective; the bed comfortable; the safe worked (2 other hotels we used on our holiday had faulty safes); the choice of pillows a terrific idea (as a sufferer of back  neck pain, this made a real difference to me); the laundry came back promptly; the bar service was good. The staff were excellent: check-in took about 30 seconds; bags were taken up to our room immediately; the housekeeping staff were friendly and always said hello (in Vegas, they avoided any eye contact, and one rarely saw them); when we needed a light bulb replacing and I wanted a special pillow, the staff responded immediately; all the staff smiled  made us welcome; the lady at the tour desk may have never actually smiled, but she was polite  helpful; the restaurant staff were efficient most of the time (though on 2 mornings they were slow and forgot part of our order), so we ate breakfast at the hotel 6 out of the 7 mornings. The food was good, and the free coffee (including de-caff.)  cookies much appreciated. There was a 'meet the staff' evening one night, with free food and wine, and we got to meet Wes, the manager - if they hold one while you are there, I recommend you go. Location of hotel is brilliant: cable car stop just outside; short walk to Powell St cable turntable, metro, BART and bus stops; ATM in hotel and one next door; Sears for breakfast 2 doors north; Lori's diner for good burgers c. 200 yards north; Wallgreens chemist/store on same block; loads of shops around Union Square; some beautiful architecture in the area, and good restaurants; several film locations (Vertigo, especially) nearby; many of these places, and other tourist destinations, are easily walkable from the hotel.We would highly recommend the Chancellor. We plan to visit San Francisco again one day, and we will book again with the Chancellor, with no hesitation. Thanks to the users of Tripadvisor for helping us choose it, and thanks to Wes and his staff for an excellent stay.

<Content>What a great place to stay in San Francisco I booked the Chancellor to attend a conference. The initial room assignment was not to my liking and they moved me immediately to an alternate room. The WiFi service was good and was included in the room rate. I loved the large tub after long days at the conference. I enjoyed walking outside the hotel and catching the cable car down to Market Street to start out my days at the conference at the Moscone Centre. I ate breakfast next door at Sears. It was no problem to get a seat at the counter. The bed was comfortable and I always felt safe. I took the BART to and from the airport, it was only a 10 minute walk from the Powell Street station to the hotel. I would recommend buying a Muni pass that gives you 7 days trnasit on the buses and the cable cars, it was great value. I will be staying here again next year.

<Content>Great Place. Great Location. And More.. While check in was a little longer than expected, this gem plied us with cookies and terrific coffee while we waited. Our room was not ready when we checked in, however they cheerfully checked our bags and took our cell number to let us know when things were set. We went to lunch and we got a call. Our room was on the smaller side, but lovely with a view of Powell street. Be warned (or warmed!) that there is no A/C at the hotel - but the room had a ceiling fan and with the breeze you didn't need it (at least for us Floridians). At night it actually felt cold to us. This was a delayed anniversary trip and they went through the extra trouble of having champagne in the room when we checked in and a nice note - Nice touch. If you want a quieter room - ask for the back. The Powell street rooms you hear the cable cars and street traffic. To us it added to the ambiance - for others it might be annoying at night.The small bar in the evening is cozy and inexpensive. The bartender is jovial and friendly -and she mixes a mean martini. The bar on top of the Sir Francis Drake across the street is very hip and happening with great views. I'd pass on breakfast on dinner at the hotel. Next door the breakfast is awesome - get there early on the weekend because there will be a line! or up the street there is a Lois's dinner (there is a number of them in town). It is very easy to get to this hotel from the airport - BART blue line to Powell. Exit BART station and board the Cable car (or walk - uphill!) for 5 blocks. You can't miss it. It's $5 for Bart and a day pass on the cable car (actually all MUNI) is $10, $18 for 3 days. You can buy it from the kiosk or the conductor. The hotel also sells passes.Overall the staff is excellent. They are willing to help anyway they can.A great stay, and a good value, if you are looking for a european style smaller hotel in a centrally located downtown area.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great Location We stayed here for 2 nights in September and found staff courteous, rooms presentable, beds comfy. I don't think you could do better for location and price. I booked direct with the hotel and then, about 10 days later, received an offer of a cheaper rate from an internet booking company. I contacted reservations and they responded very quickly and matched the offer with no quibbles. and email confirmation - and a nice touch just a couple of days before we left the UK, another email confirming the times and dates of our arrival. Thank you Chancellor, we would definitely stay again. P.SCookies and coffee were great too.

<Content>Great hotel, but one little problem I just got back from a long weekend at Chancellor Hotel on Union Square. It is a very nice older hotel. The staff there were all very helpful. The location could not be better. The one problem I had was that my skin is very very sensitive and I had a rash develop from either the contact with the sheets or towels. Which is something that happens to me sometimes when I travel, but not normally as bad as it was this time. So it is something to keep in mind if you have sensitive skin.

<Content>Friendly hotel but small rooms We prefer smaller hotels and normally stay in them when we are visiting a city. For this reason and based on the glowing reports on TripAdvisor, we selected the Chancellor Hotel for our recent 5 night stay. While we found the staff to be particularly friendly and the cookies in the lobby a nice treat, we found our room--and especially our bath--to be unusually small. You had to adjust your knees to close the door when you were sitting on the toilet! The hotel appears to cater to traveling groups because every morning the lobby was completely closed off for a breakfast for a group of Danish visitors with only a narrow passage available to reach the front desk or door. And, this may sound picky, but a group of art students staying at the hotel (the dining room was closed off for them in the mornings) would congregate at the entrance of the hotel to smoke, making entering and exiting particularly challenging. On a possitive note, the location and value are excellent and while I might not stay there again I would not discourage someone else from doing so but would like them to be aware of the shortcomings.

I initially found it difficult to find a quality hotel at a reasonable price in San Fran. That was until I found the Chancellor via Trip advisor, I didn't look back. I contacted Wes Tyler personally, who was nothing short of fantastic, he accommodated everything my parents, husband and I needed. He helped us out with some great rates, included a complimentary bottle of wine for my husband who celebrated his birthday whilst we were there. He also helped us organise our Alcatraz trip (a must whilst your there). Everytime I contacted him, he replied promptly even though there is huge time difference between San Fran and the UK. He even provided us with info on areas/where to stay around Yosemite. I felt extremely confident before even leaving the UK we would have a memorable stay..... we did.The bellman - Matt immediately took our cases and opened the door, we were checked in within 2 minutes by extremely courteous reception staff and in our room within 5 minutes of arriving, just what you want after a long journey. I actually took the time to meet Wes and thank him halfway through our stay. We were staying (thanks to Wes) in a Suite which was lovely, the rooms were beautifully decorated and we even had a view of Union Square, perfect.I would recommend this hotel to anyone, its worth the money, and the staff are fantastic and courteous at all times...stay there and see for yourself, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Had a great stay at the Chancellor I stayed in the Chancellor for four nights in September. I really cannot say anything negative about my stay. The location was great, I was able to get to anywhere I wanted in the city with ease through public transportation or walking. The staff was friendly and it was a great value. My room was clean and comfortable, larger then what I thought it would be. If I visit the city again, I would stay at this hotel as well as recommend it to friends and family.

<Content>I'll be back! Excellent choice for a business hotel. Location is convienent, staff was courteous, efficient and friendly. The WiFi worked without a problem. I was in town for a convention and it was a very short 10 minute walk to the Moscone Center. As a frequent traveller, I'm calling the Chancellor my home away from home while I'm in San Francisco.

<Content>Excellent Location The Chancellor Hotel offers a wonderful location for an excellent price. The service was pleasant and non-intrusive, just how I like it!We had a room on one of the lower floors, which meant it was quite loud. Not a problem for us, but if you prefer a quiet stay, make sure you ask for a higher room.The pillow menu is a nice touch.I would absolutely recommend this accommodation to anyone travelling to San Francisco.

<Content>A Real Find! If you like smaller european-style hotels where the rooms aren't huge but the service is and you're right in the middle of wonderful shopping and the vibrant life of San Francisco, then you'll love the Chancellor.Wes Tyler and his staff will be your hosts and will treat you like guests, not customers. The Chancellor's own web site even gives you the email addresses of Wes (the manager) and key members of his staff so they can help with your requests even before you arrive. How many hotels have you stayed in where you remember the manager's name after you leave? That was a new experience for us, but his interest in our comfort and enjoyment of San Francisco made him a friend we'll not forget.The hotel is not air conditioned, but anyone who knows San Francisco will tell you there is seldom any need for it in the 'city by the bay'. And don't be fooled by the relatively low rates - the decor and ambiance belie the prices. We're already looking forward to a return trip to San Francisco and the Chancellor Hotel.

<Content>Most Disappointed Having seen all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor for the previous couple of months, we booked The Chancellor for four nights at the beginning of September. Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to our expectations, and was certainly not the same hotel that other reviewers had been praising. We were incredulous that when we arrived, the doorman stood and watched whilst we carried our luggage in without even opening the door for us. This attitude, combined with unfriendly staff on the front desk and a very tired and shabby looking bedroom, led to a disappointing stay at The Chancellor. We would not recommend staying at this hotel.

I'd recommend opting for the self-park rather than valet since the parking garage is nearby and waiting for the valet can take a while. Definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel all round We spent 5 nights at the Chancellor and could not find fault. It is excellent value for money. The hotel has wonderful character, facilities and is in a fantastic position right on Union Square. Little features like free homemade cookies and tea/coffee in the lobby all day, the 'pillow menu' and WiFi internet access add to the experience and I would definitely stay again on another visit. Staff also very friendly and breakfast menu and food very good.

<Content>Great location, excellent value I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for two nights at the end of August. I chose the hotel because of the location near Union Square and price, but was also impressed with the friendly staff and the comfortable rooms. Why spend a ton of money on a luxury hotel when you can get a great room at the Chancellor and spend your extra money on shopping or dining? This was my first time at the Chancellor Hotel, but it will not be my last!

<Content>Wonderful, Great Location The Chancellor is fantastic! When I told Wes Tyler, the General Manager, that we were celebrating our 40th anniversary, he upgraded us to a suite on the back side on the 14th floor away from the noise. The suite was larger than we antisipated and could not have been better! we were checked in early and a bottle of champaigne was waiting in our room. The location is as good as it gets. We ate breakfast at Sears next door. The staff, from the desk clerk, the bellman, the maintance man, to the tour desk lady were all over the top. They made you feel as if you were the only people there!Although we were concerned about the lack of air conditioning, the overhead fans and the ability to open the windows kept us very comfortable.I could not imagine a better place to stay, especially concidering the cost.Thanks Wes, for a wonderful stay.

<Content>Great We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights at the end of august 2005. We reserved online on the web site of the hotel, rate was something like 125/per night including continental breakfast for 2.The room was nice and clean (room 1105) even if some furniture didn't look brand new.Everything was perfectly working in the room (bath, TV).We had a nice biew on the Union Square and on the CheeseCake Factory restaurant.Breakfast was very good, if you don't want the continental breakfast you can use your coupon for a 7 USD value on any other choice.All the staff was very firendly.So I will say this was a nice hotel and I think a good value/price, when we search online most of the hotel in the area where near the double of the price.

<Content>A return visit and a wonderful treat! My husband and I Ilive just across the Bay , and at least once a year plan a visit to the Giants ballpark and a stay at the Chancellor. We recently wanted to spend our 30th anniversary in SF and thought we might stay somewhere a little more luxurious. But why mess with success? Rather than pay double the price and be disappointed we opted to stay at our tried and true Chancellor.I sent an email to the manager, Wes Tyler, indicating that we were return guests and had referred a lot of our friends who had also stayed there and wondered if he could provide us a high floor room with as much a view as possible. Was I pleasantly surprised by his response ---he upgraded us to the 14th floor suite as a gift for our anniversary! What a wonderful gesture! But it didn't stop there. On our arrival to the room there was a bottle of champagne chilling on ice with a lovely note congratulating us!Why go anywhere else? Even if you DO have the money! We who live locally and enjoy getting to the City appreciate the value at the Chancellor without compromising anything. Stay at the Chancellor and enjoy a quaint hotel, with wonderful service, some thoughtful extras and right outside your door is the bustle of one of the most visited cities in the world. Thank you once again for a great stay and a thoughtful gesture. The Chancellor remains our San Francisco hotel.

<Content>Great Location  I have to admit that it's not a big room, but it's in SF and I was perfectly satisfied with the size (I'm from Tokyo.lol). The front man arranged us early check-in  the door-bell chased me to the Powel St. after I checked out because he was worried about my heavy luggage. As other reviews, the location is perfect to go anywhere  I could have enjoyed in my short stay there. It was the second time to go to SF but the first time to stay Chancellor Hotel. I'll go back to the hotel again!

The hotel was spotlessly clean, employees were professional, always polite and very efficient. The hotel was quiet so our sleep was never interupted We will be back to visit San Francisco and will stay at the Chancellor. Quick tip, take the BART from SFO to Powell station. Cost to us was $4.95 a person, visitors center upstairs where we picked up our Muni Pass which was very convenient and economical

<Content>One night at the Chancellor Stayed in the Chancellor for a stopover night.Wanted to get some quick shopping in and figured where better to stay than the heart of the city?Close to everything, Union Square views, cable cars outside the door, 5 minutes walk to Market Street. Excellent location.The rooms are clean and well presented and while not huge are more than adequate for a couple.We got moved from the second floor to the 4th floor because of the hum of the air-con units outside the window. Wouldn't have bothered me, but my light-sleeping missus wasn't having any of it. A quick call to Reception and we were shown 3 other rooms to take a choice from! Room 406 is beside the fire escape to the rear and was pretty quiet -my missus was well happy!Result.

<Content>I would stay here again I like this hotel a lot. We stayed for four nights, and I think it really added to our San Francisco experience. We were on the 12th floor and yes we could hear the bells of cable cars in the morning, but I thought that was nice, after all we were in San Francisco, isn't that what we're supposed to hear? The staff was very nice and accomodating. The only problem we had was a noisy neighbor who had to keep his tv and clock radio volume at ridiculously high levels one night...but that was not the hotel's fault just an inconsiderate guest. I recommend the Chancellor if you are looking for a place to stay in SF.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location My husband and I just got back from a 5 night stay at the Chancellor Hotel. We couldn't have been more happy with the hotel or the location.The hotel was charming and as stated in many other reviews a great space with a nice deep bath tub, pleasant staff members, and free daily coffee, newspapers, cookies, and fruit. Upon arrival we were able to check in over 2 hours early which was a very welcome suprise after a busy morning traveling. Our room was spacious enough for the two of us and were pleased with the large closet space and candy jar :-) The hotel restaurant was a nice place to catch an early morning breakfast (not too expensive), but many other choices were available within walking distance. Every day upon returning back after a busy day of sightseeing our room was always cleaned and ready.The location of the hotel could not have been better - right in the heart of Union Square. Cable car pick up steps away from the hotel with the turnaround just a few blocks down (as well as the streetcars and Muni). Easy wallking distance to Chinatown, restaurants, shopping, and theatres. Just a tip that across the street in the Union Square center is a half price tickets booth where you are able to purchase shows at 1/2 the price for nightly performances.We had a great experience and a wonderful trip. If ever returning to San Francisco I won't even have to think about where we will stay because it will be at the Chancellor!

<Content>Conveniently located I have stayed at the Chancellor Hotel, twice. Conveniently located, with cookies  coffee served all day in the Lobby. Bedroom great, though the long bath too large for me. Shampoo was excellent. Toilet seat too close to the door, leaving no comfortable space. Staff were friendly except for one in the restaurant who was discriminative towards me (I am Asian) Perhaps she thought I couldn't afford to pay her a big tip. When I asked for her recommendation of food at the hotel's restaurant, she replied to say I don't know, you are going to eat, not me!!! and a few minutes later, she was so nicely explaining about the food to a caucasian couple who probably earned less money than I do.

<Content>The best hotel in SF We stayed at the Chancellor on the first night of our honeymoon (we were flying out to Maui from SFO). From start to finish, this hotel was class! Excellent service (champagne in our bedroom, special pillows) and the front desk staff was phenomenal. Our every need was met! On top of all this - the hotel is very well maintained and the rooms while small are ample. The location simply cannot be beat. My husband and I walked everywhere we needed to go, and took a cable car to Fisherman's Wharf that night. The cable car picks up right across the street from the hotel. I have stayed in at least fifteen to twenty hotels in SF (we live in Sacramento, so we visit the city all the time). Of all the hotels we have stayed at, the Chancellor is by far the best. I will be heading back soon!

<Content>outstanding! I just returned from a two-night stay and it was all wonderful. The hotel is in a beautiful location and the hotel itself is outstanding. I asked for a quiet room and they didn't hesitate for a minute - they gave me a quiet room facing the back. The staff was very helpful: Rohan (the 'h' is silent, he tells me) was the one who nicely helped me with the room and a young lady (whose name I didn't catch) was very helpful in offerring to help me set up my laptop to receive e-mails in their wired rooms (take her up on her offer, if you have trouble; I figured it out ten minutes before I was due to check out. Guys don't ask for directions, but I took that too far). You can book the hotel with confidence. I have no complaints whatsoever.

<Content>Great value My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our one night stay at the Chancellor in two adjoining rooms. Both rooms were quite clean and spacious (for SF) with high (~12') ceilings. We were in a front room on the fourth floor and were not bothered by any street noise. Also when closed, the sliding windows were extremely effective in shutting out street noise. The absence of air conditioning was not a factor at all - as SF was quite cool and the air in each room was well circulated by the overhead fan. My daughters (4  6) loved the deep bath tubs and the rubber ducks. My wife noted the shower water pressure could have been stronger - but not a big deal. The ever-present fresh baked cookies (white chocolate cranberry/oatmeal cranberry/ chocolate chip were favorites) and coffee in the lobby were a welcome treat. The front desk was quick at check-in and check-out. And the concierge helpfully called our taxi upon departure. The Chancellor has the ambiance of an old-style continental hotel with an attentive staff. We look forward to returning for a longer stay on our next visit to San Francisco.

<Content>Could not be more convenient After driving up Highway 1 from LA it was nice to leave the car in the garage for a few days, although San Francisco is not as hard to drive in as people told us beforehand.For its location the Chancellor is good value, close to pretty much everything. You don't need air con: the ceilings are high and the fans are more than adequate. The rooms are not large, but you would not expect that in the middle of town.The only thing that would have been nice is a greater selection of complimentary breakfast stuff for cheapskates like me. After a few days I was a bit tired of cookies.Other than that, what's not to like?San Francisco tip - Alcatraz tours get booked up days in advance. We turned up, expecting to go the same day, and in peak season it seems we were over-optimistic.Other SF tip - don't expect LA weather every day, even in summer.

<Content>Chancellor - Great Hotel The Chancellor is a great hotel. The location is perfect. The hotel is small, but it was very comfortable. I believe there are 10 rooms per floor. No complaints about this hotel. The walk in closets are a nice touch. I thought I would have problems getting to Fisherman's Wharf, but to my amazement, the cable car took me right there. It's best to take the cable cars early in the morning or late at night, no lines. Make sure to get a multi day pass for the cable cars, muni metro and muni buses; it's a great deal. This city has the best transportation system I've ever seen, and I'm from NYC.

<Content>Great value, excellent location! We visit San Francisco at least twice a year and stay at the Chancellor Hotel. The Union Square location is perfect and the hotel is a great value!We have stayed at boutique hotels and expensive, well-known hotels in the city but the Chancellor won us over with their friendly staff. The rooms are small, which is to be expected, in any of the city's hotels except for the new tower hotels. The rooms have comfortable beds, large closets, large tubs with shower combo and a friendly rubber duckie! Excellent coffee and tea, as well as cookies, are available in the lobby. Luques, the hotel restaurant, serves an excellent breakfast and room service is delivered quickly. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The location on Powell Street puts you in the center of the city's major tourist sites: Union Square, shopping, restaurants, China Town, the Theatre District and the cable cars...all within walking distance.

<Content>Some problems I was excited to stay at the Chancellor Hotel after reading all the reviews. This hotel was certainly a bargain. We were able to get it pretty cheap from Priceline. I always wonder if we get our hotel from such a website, does that indicate we will get a bad room? We were on the top floor with no view. We saw the backs of builiding and ugly rooftops. Because we would be out of the hotel 90% of the time, I didn't mind. The front desk staff was very nice. The door man helped us with our bags and was very courteous. The hotel doesn't need A/C. It was freezing in the middle of July and the fan does a fine job cooling you down. With the windows open, however, you do hear garbage trucks and a lot of noise from the city (trolleys gear up around 6 or 7 am). We stopped downstairs to try to figure out how to get a trolley pass and we quickly found the reservation desk. The woman behind the reservation desk was unreal. I have never experienced such behavior. She was taking a personal call while we were standing in front of her. She actually put her hand over the phone and asked us what we needed, gave us a short answer and then went back to talking on the phone. It was something you would see in a sitcom. My husband got out money for a trolley pass and he stood there with the money out for over a minute while we listened to her telephone conversation. So, we didn't get the great treatment that it appears other reviewers received. The trolleys were always full and after buying a 3-day pass to use them, we were very upset that we ended up walking the majority of the time. We found out later that if we would have walked 2 blocks we would be picked up without a problem (this is something the reservation desk should have told us) Parking is around $30.00 plus tax a day, which is another expenditure you will need to budget in. We also had a problem with someone trying to get into our room around midnight on our second night. I was happy to be checking out the next day and moving onto Napa Valley where it was quieter, where you don't need to pay for parking and everyone was very accomidating.

<Content>Look no more, Stay Here!!!! I visited San Francisco for the first time in 2003 - what a fantastic city. Like New York, where I am from, it is a city that is meant to be walked (the hills are not that bad). There is also so much to do and see. If you are a tourist stay away from Fisherman's Warf, it is so stale. The only locals there are the people who work there. It's a tourist trap and it is very sad to see in a city that has so much to offer. EXPLORE.Anyways, my stay at the Chancellor Hotel was really great. It was clean, quite affordable (especially in 2003), and conveniently located for a first time visitor. I was on a bit of a budget so was unable to rent a car but did not need one. I relied on public transportation and also explored alot of the city by foot. The public transportation is great during the day and evening, but late at night it seems to stop. I remember one night after going to a club waiting for one of the electric trolleys on Market Street. I waited....and waited, someone else showed up who was also waiting. I thought that this seemed promising as I found it unlikely that he would also be a tourist so the trolley should be here soon. Time continued to pass and I decided to ask him how frequent the trains run late at night, it turned out that he too was from New York (our public transportation runs 24/7 so we were both accustomed to this). Soon a car pulled up and one of the passengers asked what we were doing, they gave us the impression that the trolley was not coming and since I had not seen any taxis and my fellow New Yorker was going in the same direction I asked if we could have a ride. They let us and I was brought back to the Chancellor.Back to the Chancellor, I stayed there about a week and a half and did not spend much time in the hotel aside from the first day when I had a bit of jet lag. My only complaint would be that the linens and towels seemed a bit worn, not dirty, but worn. The room seemed large to me, but I live in New York where apartments are small and I was staying by myself. The furnishings and decor are nothing out of the ordinary and very modest. It looked like a hotel. The staff was friendly and seemed aproachable if you had questions. Again, the Location could not be better for a first time visitor. I would definitely recommend it to a friend so I suggest that you consider staying here. Also, if you are looking for some inexpensive, interesting entertainment when visiting, head to the Audium. It is located not far away from the Chancellor. A friend had told me about it and said that I had to go. She was right! It is run by this older couple and was started in maybe the 60's or 70's. It is basically an electronic musical performance. The listening room has speakers embeded in the ceiling and floor so the sound envelops you. It is basically old-fashioned surround sound and is really alot of fun. Visit ---- for more information.Have a great time in San Francisco,Matt

<Content>A nice stay at the Chancellor For the price, this hotel's location cannot be beat. It's central to almost everything that there is to see and do in San Francisco. The rooms are a bit small, but comfortable and there are several nice touches such as the pillow menu. They also have an oversized bathtub which I considered a bonus, especially after a great deal of time spent walking and site seeing. I would also recommend the hotel restuarant for breakfast and Sears Fine Foods, next door, is very good for dinner. I wouldn't complain if I were told that I had to stay at the Chancellor again. :)

<Content>When A Hotel Is A Home... My wife and I arrived in SFO on a Friday morning; we traveled from the airport via the subway (BART) to Union Square stop (Powell Street) and walked up what seemed to be a monsterous hill (given this was our first time in SFO we were impressed - the hill was nothing compared to the Russian Hill area). We checked in with Wes Tyler (General Manager); we went to a room on the 5th floor and my wife was not overly pysched by the view or location again, first time in SFO). So, she called and explained our situation...I sat on the edge of the tub just trying to catch my breath...Wes was great...He said comeback in an hour...We came back and Wes had (way) upgraded our room location. After reading some of the pooh-pooh reviews about the Chancellor Hotel, I was simply blown away by the unfathomable idiocy of some people. Wes hit for us a homerun, when we striked out at a couple resturants, we said let's go back to the hotel and regroup, it was like home. The Chancellor is NOT for everyone, some stuffy old bag was complaining to the front desk, all I heard was let me tell you about my first night here... As Wes has commented here before, it is an older hotel, the ceilings are 12-15' high. There is no AC and there does not need to be, we were cold with the window cracked open and the ceiling fan on. There is no swimming pool, but why go to a hotel in the center of Union Square if you want to swim in a pool in the basement? There is not much else to say, the Chancellor was a key, central part of our first trip to SFO. Wes - Thank you and please thank your staff as well...

<Content>Great San Fran Hotel Great little hotel with excellent location. Some reviews stated small room but if you are a frequent traveler to San Fran you know this is very roomy compared to most. A big walk in closet, nice deep tub, table and chairs, workdesk. Also, the windows are very thick so when shut the street noise is almost undetectable. No A/C but in San Fran this is usually not an issue since the windows do open. The staff where terrific as well. Free day passes to the St Francis health club next door is a great feature. St Francis guest do not even get free use, they pay a $12 fee. Would definitely suggest to friends.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This hotel is excellent. I stayed there for 4 days, and absolutley everything went perfectly. Best of all, Ms. Song, at the tour desk, was very helpful. She arranged our rental car, gave us tips and directions, taxis, etc.The location of this hotel could not be better. It was easy to get from/to, and you could walk to anything. The trolley comes right to the front door also.Several other reviews complained of noise in the front rooms. I did not find that to be the case at all. We stayed on the 5th floor, at the fron of the hotel. It was quiet at night. The soudproofing was quite good.The bathrooms were not as small as I expected, and the rooms were a nice size. At no time dod I feel cramped.I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It was an excellent value.

<Content>Great Hotel and Excellent Value! I stayed at the Chancellor on July 5th and 6th. I arrived a day earlier than planned, and the hotel was able to accomodate me immediately. All of the staff that I encountered was friendly and helpful. The room was smaller, in the European style, but it was a perfect size for me. The tub was wonderful-it was very deep and perfect for a long soak after a day in the city. The bath salts and rubber ducky were an excellent touch. From the hotel, it's easy to access BART and the cable cars, and it's within walking distance of great shopping, resterants, and theater. For a first time San Francisco visitor, it is darn near perfect.The Chancellor is an outstanding value for the dollar. I highly recommend it for its value, cleanliness, and convienance.

<Content>Great location We spent a week (6/21-6/28) at The Chancellor and really enjoyed everything about it. We had a corner room facing Powell Street. We had been concerned about the lack of AC, but it was never a problem. With the windows (room and bathroom) opened, we had a wonderful breeze. The cookies (in the lobby) were wonderful and the location is perfect. We bought a 7 day pass and did everything with the use of public transportation. We took a city tour, Muir Woods and Sausalito, and Montery/Carmel bus tours...all were good and picked us up from the hotel.Dinner a John's Grill was great ...about a 3 block trip. Other good places to eat in the area are Uncle Vito's (great pizza) and David's Deli.This hotel is a great choice.....

<Content>Great location, great price! The location really couldn't have been better. It's surrounded by good shopping and fast transportation. I was dissappointed when I discovered that there was no a/c (because their website mentioned climate controled rooms, but apparently were referring to the heater), but it wasn't a problem. A little warm in the day, but nice and cool at night. The asian woman in the lobby at the tour info. booth was a bit harsh in her answers/directions, but if you have a dry sense of humor, she's hilarious! A few suggestions for the first timer's like us: Buy a MUNI pass at the SF Visitor's Bureau right off of BART @ Powell St. With the pass, you can get anywhere in the city. You can get all kinds of brochures there too with discounts to most anything you want to see. Also, if you want to see a show, go to the TIX stand (right accross from the hotel basically) for 1/2-price same-day shows. We saw Hush Up...Sweet Charolette, and it was hilarious!

<Content>Affordable and yet classy My partner and I stayed during the very busy Pride weekend. They are located right across from Union Square. Walk a few blocks to Market and you have Muni and BART station. The staff is very hospitable and friendly. The reception clerk immediately offered a choice of rooms, stating that she wished our stay to be enjoyable. There are delicious complimentary cookies in the lobby, as well as a variety of quality complimentary coffees. The hotel is very clean with a subdued elegance, despite its age. Clearly there has been a lot of recent remodeling. The room had a great view of Union Sqare and it was very quiet. All comforts were to be found: ceiling fan, internet access with keyboard, extra pillows and instructions for ordering specialty pillows, extra tissues and toilet paper, rubber duck for the bath, vanity extendable magnifying mirror, hair dryer, cable TV with HBO, fancy digital alarm clock with built in CD player. We were also given a discount coupon to try the restaurant, Luques. We went for lunch. The menu choice is not large, but the price is very reasonable and the food was excellent. There is no parking at the hotel, but either valet or self parking are available nearby at an affordable price.

<Content>Can't beat the Chancellor My husband and I, along with his sister and husband stayed for an extended (Canadian) long weekend on May.What can I say, but the reviews are all true. Great hotel, reasonable rates, meets all your needs, great location but has a small bathroom (how much time do you really spend in there anyway).Not a cloud in the sky for our entire visit, the hotel was comfortable at night with the window opened (a lot of sirens on the street a couple of nights - but hey, it's a major city centre - it happens).Having only one elevator caused delays only a couple of times.Front desk gave advice and directions whenever we needed it, even the bellman offered us his ticket to the Giants game when he knew that we were going.I think staying in Union Square is the best place for a new tourist to stay.Great place all around!

<Content>a weekend in San Fancisco My husband and I just returned from a weekend in San Francisco! This was our second time staying at the Chancellor and over all, it was a GREAT trip. We were so excited when we called just a few days before we left to find that they were having some kind of a promotion. We got a great deal for our rooms! We love the location of the Chancellor, we never have to use our car. We love to shop and it is soo close to every shopping place imafinable. And if shopping isn't your thing, you're just a cable car away from everywhere else in the city. The staff at the Chancellor is wonderful and we love the location of the hotel. The only thing that I might complain about on this trip was the water pressure in our shower. It was AWFUL! I didn't remember it being that bad the last time we stayed there. Maybe it depended on the room, Room 800.Overall however, we LOVe the Chancellor and will definitely be staying here again.

<Content>Good choice Thought this was an excellent choice for San Francisco - really good location near to lots of good things to see and places to eat. We had 2 interconnecting rooms of a good size with lots of storage (very useful as we had lots of luggage), with lovely big bathtubs and very comfortable beds. The staff were all very helpful and attentive.We paid $99 per room per night via San Francisco Hotels, which I thought was excellent value for the quality of accommodation and location. The lobby where you got the neverending supply of coffee and cookies was a bit small and could get a bit full of tour groups and people with luggage, but that was the only downside.We stayed in the height of summer and did not notice the lack of air conditioning. We had rooms at the back which I would recommend, we were disturbed on our last night by some noise, but otherwise we slept soundly.

The room was very nicely decorated, very quite. The only negative was the size of the bathroom was small but with amenties like the Pillow menu, the cookies and the coffee/tea there is really nothing I can find fault with. Mr Tyler was also very Helpful in all of my requests and I will defintely be back!I left my heart in San Francisco .....

<Content>Chancellor was a disappointment My husband and I stayed at the Chancellor for four days in June and would give it mixed reviews. Yes, the location is great right at Union Square, but the hotel lobby needs renovation badly and the beds were uncomfortable. The rooms were quite clean, but they either face busy Union Square or a huge bank of air conditioners that don't turn off until 11 or after. Because the weather was unusually warm, we were quite uncomfortable since the hotel itself does not have air conditioning and had to request a move which was quieter and cooler in a corner room. Wifi was spotty to non-existant in our room and to make matters worse we were refused a AAA discount when we checked out because we had signed a paper when we arrived. The staff seemed uninspired but they did accomodate our move graciously and generally were helpful, especially with the wifi. The restaurant served a good breakfast and gave service with a smile.

<Content>Location, ambience, price! Well, all the great reviews I've read here these past many months were right about the Chancellor. First of all, I was glad I stayed in the Union Square area instead of the Wharf; there was more to do in the evening, and the beggar situation was nowhere near as bad as I expected. As for the hotel itself, who said the rooms were small? I thought they were just right for a couple, and besides, the closet was huge! It really gave us a place to stash the suitcases. We had a nice view of Union Square and the cable cars going by, and the street-level horn player at night added to the atmosphere.Nearby is everything...all the shops, eating places of all kinds (we liked Lori's Diner just up the street, it was cheap and good). Just two doors down is a Borders book store, the big stores like Macy's and the rest are very close as well. Although only one elevator was working, the wait was never long. Nice touches:- The clocks over the elevators with the times for SF, Honolulu, NY, London, Tokyo etc.- Coffee and various teas in the lobby, along with the Chronicle, NY Times and USA Today newspapers.- The rubber ducky and pillow menu. - A deep bathtub.- A retro feel to the whole hotel, not shabby in any way, but clean and classy looking.- The good vibes here, I've never chatted so much to people in elevators as I have here!Overall we enjoyed our stay here very much, and would definitely recommmend it to any couples looking for a safe place to land in SF. Get a MUNI pass from the tour desk, our 3 day pass for $15 was a bargain.

<Content>Great Value and Location Just returned from SF, stayed 3 nights at the Chancellor. We were very pleased with out stay. Comments regarding previous reviews: the single elevator really didn't pose much of a problem, however we were on the 5th floor so never had to wait long. I understand the elevator renevations are to be completed by the end of June. We had a room facing the street-and it was noisy at night, garbage trucks, etc. I was prepared and brought ear plugs and slept soundly once I put them in! The noise is my only complaint. The hotel is very conveniently located-the cable car stops right in front of the hotel-never had trouble getting on during the weekdays. We ended up taking the cable car to nearly everywhere we went. Lots of shopping very close by. Room was sufficiently spacious, large closet with floor length mirror. Would defintely return to this hotel considering it was relatively inexpensive. Recommended restaurants: Puccini  Pinetti 129 Ellis Street-3-4 blocks south of hotel, Italian, wood-fired pizzasZarzuela's-Fun Tapas restaurant at Union  Hyde intersection, cable car stop at the intersectionPier Market at Pier 39-Seafood restaurant with a to-go counter, benches nearby to enjoy the food. To-go counter serves some of the same menu items at cheaper prices.

<Content>Would stay again Stayed for 2 nights mid May. Since we had a rental car with us from our prior week in Southern CA and needed it again for 2 days later, appreciated that the Chancellor's price included parking and was still very reasonable. Room was small but fine, everything clean, and the coffee/tea (I especially appreciated that there was tea), fruit, cookies 24/7 were a nice touch, as was the pillow menu! We only had to wait for the elevator more than a minute one time, and so what...we were not in a big rush where three extra minutes were going to matter one way or the other. Hotel very convenient to cable car and BART. They put us in a back room as we'd requested. The staff were very friendly and helpful...when we arrived in SF for our 1st time ever and were a bit flustered about finding a spot to park the car temporarily, etc., they helped out a lot. My only suggestion would be to tell people who will be arriving by car and needing the parking, a bit more detail by phone or email about what to do if there is no spot in front of the building. Overall, great stay.

<Content>Surpassed Expectations It was everything as stated and more. Location, price, amenities etc. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The lady at the tour desk was very helpful and patiently answered all of our questions. Her help was invaluable. I recommend buying the muni pass for unlimited travel (available at the tour desk). It more than pays for itself especially if you want to ride the cable cars more than once or twice.The rooms were charming and provided more amenities than many brand name hotels. I would classify it as a genuine boutique hotel and highly recommend it to everyone. I am a retired airline employee who's traveled the world and I know a bargain when I see one. Folks, this is it!Date of stay: May 18-20

<Content>Don't believe the hype My wife and I were staying at another hotel while on business and decided to stay the weekend at the Chancellor (we booked it before we left). Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to the reviews. The room was small (not unexpected based upon other reviews), the room was very old and in need of a major renovation (a little surprising), the elevator was still broken (wow - I had assumed that would be fixed... how long do these things take to repair? and how many months ago was that first posting about the elevator being broken?). Staff - were marginal. They weren't so friendly / helpful but not bad either. Overall, the hotel didn't live up to the other reviews. Going back and looking at them now makes me think that they almost look too good to be true. The hotel is not a diamond in the rough, it is a budget hotel. Not terrible, but not good either.

<Content>Good Value, very central We spent ages choosing a hotel in San Francisco, with the help of Trip Advisor. It was a good choice, very central. The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful (seems to be the norm in SF) and the bar was a nice place to pass some time, the bar staff were really nice and chatty, with recommendations of places to go. A really nice place to stay. There was lots of coffee (and the tea wasn't bad, anyone British)and cookies in the morning. The only thing was because it is so central, it is quite noisy,as it faces onto Union Square. It has no Air Conditioning, so even in April we had the windows open. The cable cars run till late and the garbage trucks run in the early hours of the morning. The rooms are quite small by American Standards, but we had plenty of space for our four day stay, and the bathrooms were very clean with lots of good products.Lois's diner on the corner one block down is great for breakfast, or any time, and there is another one at Ghiradelli Square. Suprisingly cheap for such a central location, like the Chancellor.

It is on union square. The room was clean. There was some outside noise but it did not bother us. The breakfast in the hotel was awesome.

<Content>Great hotel!! Great location!! We stayed four nights and definitely would stay again. Had a corner room on the 12th floor that was big with a walk in closet. Everything was very clean and comfortable. The fresh fruit upon arrival was a very nice touch along with the cookies and apples at the front desk. The location was the best, cable cars right outside, no problem. If you do stay longer than three days do purchase a pass for $15, well worth it. They do have ones for 7 days as well that you can buy right at the hotel. We ate at Lori's Diner a block up very good with big portions and at Uncle Vito's a couple of blocks up for dinner. (good pasta and pizza) If you do have a car, it is a 20 minute wait but call in the morning and let them know when you would like the car and it's waiting for you. We didn't have a problem with the elevator, the other one should be open in June. They do a excellent job!!!

<Content>Wonderful place to stay! My husband and I returned recently from a six day stay at the Chancellor. We read many reviews before making our decision and are thankful we booked the Chancellor. It is not the place to stay if one is interested in spending the whole day in the room in a hot tub pampering oneself. We went to enjoy the city and wanted a clean, comfortable room in a perfect location. We got that and more. The whole staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We asked for a corner room above the fifth floor located on the back side of the hotel to be away from the street noise. We left our windows open during the day, but closed them at night and left the ceiling fan on. The bed was very comfortable, and we slept soundly. We asked for a refrigerator which was in our room and chilled upon our arrival. We arrived at noon, but our room was ready, so we were able to check in immediately. The large closet and room safe were really appreciated. Our first stop was Chinatown to buy fresh fruits and veggies to keep in our room. Walgreens is nextdoor, so we bought soft drinks and other snacks as well as getting our film developed at the one hour photo. The location could not have been better. All transportation was within four blocks and the Muni pass was worth every penny. During our stay, we toured all sections of the city and were able to get on and off any place and time we wished. We used buses, trolleys, and the BART. A car was not needed except for a trip outside the city. On Geary St near Powell, Lefty O'Douls has an inexpensive menu and a piano bar we really enjoyed on Saturday night. We also got a great sandwich to take back with us on our flight. I could go on and on about our wonderful time. We can't wait to go back and will positively stay at the Chancellor.

<Content>Great Hotel! I recently spent three nights in the Chancellor Hotel and loved it. It was a perfect size -- big enough to offer amenities that one doesn't find at tiny hotels, yet small enough to feel cozy and friendly. Everything was spotlessly clean. And you could not ask for a more friendly, pleasant, helpful staff. I recommend it highly.

<Content>Would stay here again We stayed at the Chancellor blindly - we had never been to San Francisco and didn't know what we would get. It was a great choice for us. Our room was very small, because the hotel is old, but it was clean and had all the necessities. We were rarely in it anyway so size was not a problem. The cable car stops right in front of the hotel which is very convenient. The hotel has a travel desk which is awesome because it helps you plan your days to get the most of your experience. We were there from late Wednesday night until Sunday afternoon and we saw a lot of San Francisco thanks to the planning help. They helped us to arrange a bus tour of the city (picked us up at the door) and a bus tour of wine country. Both were reasonable and well worth the money. They also helped us figure out the public transportation and then we were really free to explore the city. We were in a great location - very close to many attractions and restaurants. We had drinks at the bar a couple of times. The bar is VERY small but friendly and actually surprisingly lively on the weekend nights. We had breakfast in the restaurant (good) but didn't eat meals there. (WAY too many great restaurants in the city to eat at a hotel!) We paid $79 a night for our room and considering the hotel prices in SF we thought we got a bargain. We look forward to staying there again. It is not a swank, posh hotel, but it is in a great location and had what we needed.

<Content>Great value - Great Location We visited San Francisco from 28/04/05 - 04/05/05 as tourists. We had no idea where to stay or what would be the best location so the reviews on this site were a great help. We definitely chose well with The Chancellor. The Location could not have been better within easy walking distance from Unions Square, Nordstrom Shopping Centre, cable car, China Town and restaurants too many in number to mention. The staff were friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. The lady at the tour desk was very helpful with booking day trips. We picked the Grey Line city tour combined with the Alcatraz trip ***** and a day trip to Monterey and Carmel also *****. The drivers on these trips are amazing, their knowledge of the area is boundless and they never stop talking. One restaurant worth a mention is Sears right next door to the Chancellor, people queuing to get in is always a good sign, but time it right and you will get straight in. We had breakfast and dinner at Sears and would recommend both. Cable cars are great fun but if you can manage the hills try walking it is amazing the little treasures you come across on foot. We would definitely recommend the Chancellor to anyone on a budget; it offered every thing it promised. The only disappointment we found, and it was my fault really for not checking, was that there is no in room tea and coffee making facilities. The hotel does provide 24hour self serve tea and coffee free of charge in the foyer but this requires someone to go down and fetch it. Not something you necessarily want to do in your jim-jams when you have just woken up.

<Content>Ambassadors for San Francisco and America鈥︹€?#x201d; A big thank, we had a wonderful holiday-what ambassadors for San Francisco and America鈥︹€?br/>I feel I must write this, as we are all too quick to criticise and very rarely take the time to give praise where due.My Husband and I were visiting San Francisco from England for the first time, we stayed at the hotel on in April for 5 nights and I can only endorse all the previous comments. All of the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is superb, right in the heart of everything.The coffee, cookies and fruit in the lobby were a nice and very welcoming touch 鈥?in our busy schedule we never had chance to sample the restaurant, but I feel sure it lived up to the rest of the high standards throughout the hotel.The rooms were exceptionally clean and the little touches of the rubber duck  umbrella were much appreciated.I would certainly recommend this hotel, should we have the good fortune to visit San Francisco again - it would be our first choice.

The Bellman Rienaldowas real nice and remembered us throughout our stay. The Restaurantwas also very good. We ate at Sears Fine foods next door and had a goodmeal but the hotel restaurant was just as good! Our room was small buthad the character of a European Hotel.

<Content>Perfect-Perfect-Perfect My 12 year-old daughter and I planned a trip to SF for her Spring Break over the Easter holiday. I did ALOT of research on hotels, and since we were travelling alone, I wanted a safe, convenient hotel that was not too expensive (we stayed for 6 nights).I narrowed my search to about 5 hotels and when I read the reviews regarding the Chancellor, I was most impressed that the General Manager took the time to reply to some them. I booked directly with the hotel (and received a better rate than if I would have booked via any online travel site-Expedia, Travelocity, hotels) and I mentioned to the gentleman that this would be my daughter's fist trip to SF and asked for a room with a view. When we checked in, the gentleman checking us in was the same one I had booked the reservation with and he remembered me! It was so nice! Check-in was super fast and our room was a corner room on the 13th floor facing the street. We had great views of Union Square and loved opening our window to hear the hustle and bustle of the street and, most importantly, the sounds of the cable cars going by. We never heard our neighbors and inside the hotel it was super quiet.The room was wonderful: it was clean, spacious and quaint. The closet was HUGE and the bathroom had nice touches (the rubber ducky). We felt completely safe in this hotel. The hotel had a nice clientele of guests that were a mix of American and European. The location is beyond compare! Once I saw where the other hotels were located (and the quality), I was so thankful that I booked with Chancellor. It truly is a world-class hotel with a lovely staff and a location that is perfect! Any time I go back to SF I will stay here and I would highly recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Exceeded my expectations and I expected much. A BIG BIG thank you to all Tripadvisor members who recommended the Chancellor. Thanks even to those who tried to nit-pick because it caused the general manager to reply and it was obvious from his replies that he was very proud of his hotel. I thought, This just HAS to be a well-run hotel. - so I booked it.I was not disappointed; the Chancellor met all my expectations and then some. My wife, who is very fussy about rooms being clean was very pleased with the cleanliness and comfort of our room. We stayed eight nights and had a great time in SF. The hotel is near to: cable cars (just outside), trolley busses and trams (a short walk to Market St) and the shops. It was dead easy to get to Fisherman's Warf even when the cable-cars were were busy over the Easter holiday - we just took the F-Line from Market Street.One of the lifts was not working while we were there, due to renovation, but it caused us very little inconvenience.The staff were very polite and helpful and one of the reception staff TWICE helped me out when I had got into a mess with shuttle-bus bookings.I live a LONG LONG way from SF but, if I ever get to go there again, I shall definitely be booking into the Chancellor.

<Content>We are lucky to have this hotel in SF We have stayed here on several occaisions this past year and were never disappointed. The staff is very attentive but low-key. The hotel is well maintained. The rooms are quiet and well appointed. The location is superb. Overall its a great value. It can take time to get your car if you want it between 10 and 11 AM. We look forward to the completion of repairs that will bring elevator #2 back on line. For those who complained about slow checkout, maybe the hotel should offer checkout through the TV like some other hotels do. Wes, you need to lighten up a little on your reaction to some of these reviews. You can't please everyone, but based on this website, you come awful close to it. Keep up the good work.

<Content>Lovely Hotel we stayed their, 27-feb-05 for 4 nights and The hotel is gorgeous, our room was extreamley clean, the decor was nice and modern (plain/fresh looking) and the location is 2nd to none!! we had a brilliant stay in San Francisco only one night when we went out we had our Wallet stolen, which ment we had to cancel all of our credit cards and had very little cash on us, anyway as soon as this happened i went to the front desk to make them aware that if they have not yet already taken the money of off my card that now it will proberbly will not work as i had to cancel them all, basically the hotel people didnt ask if we were ok they just wanted to know how we were going to settle our bill, i think that this was most unconsiderable, as we were thousands of miles away from home with no food, no money and all the hotel cared about was me settling the bill, i mean its not like i couldnt of settled it at a later date. they had all my details so it was not like i was trying to get out of paying. i think that if you had thought more about the safety of your customers rather then there money you would be the best hotel ever. thanks for everything as i was a very nice stay, but i think you should take note of what i have said as this could happen to another customer and if they was not lucky like us, i mean getting money the next day then i dont know what we would have done as you didnt look like you wanted to help us at all

<Content>Great Location, Wonderful staff We spent 8 days at the Chancellor on Union Square during February. The hotel is perfectly situated for shopping and touring - there's a huge Macys right across the square. The cable car runs right outside the hotel and goes all the way down to Fisherman's Wharf where you can do loads of things - within the hotel there is a tourist desk where Susan will arrange pick-ups for you - to the airport, coach tours, the lot - she was extremely friendly and very very helpful! We did a tour to Muir Woods - excellent and great views of SF from across the bay in Sausalito!The hotel rooms are clean and although the beds are a bit small; we would have preferred Queens, the overall comfort is great for the price. We thought the little extras like the jar of sweeties and cotton buds in the bathroom were nice and made it seem very homely.The staff are all very friendly and helpful and we would definitely stay there again.For dinner, we found an excellent, reasonably priced, diner around the corner called Daily's Grill - highly recommend it. And for the best breakfast ever go to Taylor Street Cafe - 3 or 4 blocks away but absolutely worth the walk - best breakfast I have ever had in the USA!!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel I stayed at the Chancellor with my partner in the last week of February this year (2005) and what a fantastic stay it was.Clean, good sized rooms, the little rubber duck in the bathroom, the gorgeous cookies and coffee in the lobby and the handy apples all add up to make this my first choice for any return visits to San Francisco.The best thing about the hotel, though, is the location. Smack Bang on Union Square, a 5 minute walk to Chinatown and a Cable Car stop right outside.The staff were wonderful and always helpful.Highly recommended

<Content>Excellent! I've just returned from a 9-night stay at the Chancellor, and I must state that it was fantastic! Before booking the hotel, I read reviews on Trip Advisor, and thought everyone is going over the top on this one, but having stayed there, I'm joining in the praise-giving!The best bits? It's CHEAP, but you wouldn't think so with the service they provide! The location is out of this world...right on Union Square, on Powell Street (so you can easily get a cable car to Fishermans Wharf) and within walking distance (15-20 mins max) of places like the Moscone Convention Center south of Market. The room was perfectly sized for me - I can't understand why people were saying it was too small, but maybe it would be a stretch with 2 people staying, I don't know. Nice touches included the jar of sweets and the rubber duck - a coffee machine would have been great, if only to wake me up in the morning (as the bed was too comfortable!), but that's only a minor issue as there was coffee available in the reception area. It was also really quiet - despite being in a busy area, I never really had a problem sleeping, and it was certainly in a safe location.Thanks also go to the lady on the Tour Desk, who I probably annoyed too much with my requests for bus tours, sweets, drinks, transfers to the airport etc...but she carried out these requests with no fuss at all.Problems? Nothing major, and certainly nothing to reduce the review by 5 stars to 4. I think most have commented on the fact only one lift works - although on the 11th floor, I never found this a problem at all (no more than 5 minutes waiting), and while I was there, it was clear that everything was being done to accomodate this (e.g. notifying residents), so I can't really call this a problem. However, I did once try to walk to the 11th floor (of 14, I think) and, even as a fit(ish) 20-something, I was really tired by the time I got to the top! Also, room service in the evening was only provided Wed - Sat: I would have liked this to have been provided on other nights, as (travelling alone) I found it really awkward walking into restaurants and asking for a table for one...however, there were PLENTY of local restaurants only steps away from the hotel, so I guess it's a business decision - I normally ate my food at the bar, and it didn't appear that the service was over-subscribed, so I guess most people would prefer to eat out at a local restaurant instead. Finally, I wouldn't really book here if you're a smoker (the hotel is completely non-smoking), or if you're looking for a party atmosphere (e.g. a stag night/bachelor party) - go to a cookie-cutter hotel for that!Overall, great! If I return to SF, I'll certainly return here.

<Content>good value for money I stayed there with my two sons in July 2004. First I was a bit surprised to be given a room with two single beds when we had booked for a party of three. But on the one hand, there were enough blankets, sheets and pillows to prepare a third bed on the floor, and on the other, I wasn't out for complaining and relocating but for the beauty of SF. When I later heard from other travellers that they had paid as much as I had for staying in veritable dumps (in San Francisco) I began to understand why the Chancellor is always getting such a good rating from customers. It's just good standard for little money.

<Content>Value  My girlfriend and I recently spent four nights (Fri thru Mon) at the Chancellor and couldn't have been happier. The location, on Powell St. about a block above Union Sq., is perfect: it's about a 10-minute walk from the BART station at Market  Powell (easy  cheap to get to either SFO or Oakland Airport) or, perhaps more importantly, Chinatown; the Powell/Hyde cable car is right outside the door; and its location places you within an hour's walk of most things you'd want to do in town. And SF is a beautiful walking city.Our room, if not commodious, was cozy, comfy, quiet (tip: we were on the top floor NOT facing Powell) and spotless. It also had a nice view of the SF skyline (not postcard-worthy, but still cool). One thing significant in my chosing the Chancellor was that guests have free gym privileges at the Westin just down the block. Also, if you're driving, the hotel has reduced-rate parking at an indoor lot just a couple blocks away (unlimited in/out).Overall, we got great value for our $$, and would happily stay at the Chancellor again.

<Content>A *MUST STAY* hotel My partner and I got to the hotel on Friday the 25th for a three night stay. After a quick four block walk from the BART station, we were a little early for check in. Knowing that check in wasn't until 3pm (it was 10:30a), we didn't think it'd hurt to ask if our room was ready. It wasn't, BUT, this is where this hotel's sincere hospitality we've all been reading about started. The young girl at the desk was very apologetic to us about the room not being available, but she actually called Housekeeping to see when it would be ready. They gave her an approximate time for our exact room and she offered to hold our luggage. She recommended a couple of things to do in and around Union Square to pass the time and should check back later, all this time calling me by my last name. Within 2 hours, we came back (still waaay before the 3 o'clock hour) and happily said our room was ready. It's a great way to start a vacation. No complaints whatsoever with the room. 14th floor, overlooking Union Square. Elevator wait, no problem. No air conditioner, no problem. Not the right pillow we wanted, no problem. Great towels, great closet, the ceiling fan a great touch. The window fully opened letting us take the views and the sounds all in. We took advantage of the free cookies, coffee, apples, and candy (in the room). We befriended the lady behind the Tour Desk. I think her name was Susan. Despite what was previously said about her in a another post, she was genuinely friendly. She reminded us of Edna, respectfully, in the movie The Incredibles. :-) She was full of recommendations and answered our questions before we even asked. This is where you buy the 3 day or 1 day Passport for the Cable cars, MUNI buses, or trolleys. GREAT value. She has the usual Cokes, bottles of water, aspirin, etc. for sale. You can also buy tour tickets from her as well.We did eat at the restaurant there. Luques (?) I think was the name. It was Sunday morning we ate breakfast there. Good, fast, a little on the high $ide, but nonetheless worth it. The location of this hotel, as said before, is unbeatable. Wether going north bound or south bound on the cable cars, the stops are literally 30 steps away from the front door. You have anything you want within 4 blocks of you. Shopping, a WalGreens, the Laci Diner (open until 3am on the weekends), Chinatown, BART, Market Street, you name it. And do take advantage of the public transportation San Fran has to offer. I have never been on a public bus in ANY major city before this trip, and when I did, I felt safe and relatively comfortable (even on a rainy Saturday night). Didn't take one single cab ride anywhere. Also there are plenty of bus stops within 2 blocks of the hotel going in any direction. With San Francisco and all of her glory, every night we were still looking forward to coming back to the Chancellor even after taking in the sights and sounds. And every night we were met with Hi, how are you?, Good evening, How was your night?, etc. Truly heartfelt and meaningful. What else is there to say? We will be back. Absolutely not a place to forget. Thank you!

<Content>Great for European families! We stayed here for 4 nights from february 10th and enjoyed the family package [well worth looking at, as you can use your continental vouchers to help pay for their great Union Squarebreakfast]. The hotel is fine, clean and well organised. The lift wait was a minor problem once - but how else can they refurbish.It's right on a cable car line, right near Union Square and the Bart and other Muni transport. It has various restaurantsof different price ranges on the doorstep [though their ownLucqes is fine aswell] and for families travelling a 24 hour pharmacy nearby.The rooms were clean, larger than I imagined, well appointed with those rubber bath duckies an extra treat. All staff were great with us and the coffe and cookies in the lobby a good wayto talk to staff and get touristy information. We even found out from one of the staff that there was a O'Shaughnessy Boulevard- so we had to go and find it.I thought for San Fran prices our deal was good value for money,no worries here. The O'Shaughnessy family, Manchester, England.

<Content>Will never stay anywhere else!! Well, the reviewer in front of me stole most of my thunder but it's worth repeating because this hotel ROCKS!! My wife and I stayed at The Chancellor for two nights on our way to our annual trip to Lake Tahoe. Check-In:We arrived at the hotel an hour or so before check-in time and were informed that our room was ready (yes!). We were shown to our room and what is waiting for us after our long journey from Florida? A very NICE bottle of champagne on ice. We felt like king  queen, what a great touch. I don't think they do this for everybody, but I'm not sure. I had had some previous correspondence with the GM about his comments on this board and his superior commitement to his hotel by e-mail.The Room:We requested a room facing Union Square and located on a high floor. Guess what - we were on the 14th floor and faced Union Square. We travel a lot and I have NEVER stayed in a room more clean, EVER. This includes The Ritz and a couple other 5 star hotels. The rooms are plenty big for two people. There was a small desk with chair, a queen sized bed, 2 cocktail chairs with table, a dresser, and 2 nightstands (i think). A large walk-in closet was great for holding luggage (we had a ton), clothes, and shoes. The bathroom was normal sized with a tub/shower, a sink, and a toilet (obviously). The bathroom had obviously been remodeled quite a few times over a 100 year period but maybe could use a little touch up. It was sparkeling and spotless, but the tile and floors could be replaced or touched up. This is my only mildly negative comment.Personal Touches:This is where this hotel really shines. We have never seen anything like it!-Fluffy, oversized, monogrammed towles and washclothes were heaven.-Rubber ducky in the bath was great.-High quality coffee in the lobby 24/7 - free!-Cookies and fruit in the lobby 24/7 - free!-Mixed hard candy jar in every room - free!-Pillow menu to die for. (they even have a pillow with music/speakers in it)-White noise and sound machines available upon request.-Foot massagers  bubble bath machines available for small fee.-Umbrealla located in every room (chances are you'll need it at some point)-Room safe with your personal access code.-Harry  David chocolate on our pillows on Valentine's Day.-Cieling fans in every room.I know there are more but I can't remember tham all. Needless to say, we were thrilled with all the above.Location:Can't be beat! Walk about 10 steps and you're at a Cablecar stop on Powell Street (Chinatown, Fisherman's .Wharf, etc...) You can walk to Chinatown (it's a small hike). All the shopping around Union Square. Buy your MUNI pass about a half block away. Many great bars and restaurants within walking distance. What more can I say.Staff:Absolutely great!! We NEVER walked through the lobby without somebody asking us Can we do anything to make your stay better? or How is your stay at The Chancellor so far? or Do you need any tour information? - You get the point. Everybody was extremely friendly and helpful. Smiles all the way around at check-in and check-out. You can tell it's a great big family atmosphere. I agree with the above review regarding the bartender, but would never let one employee blemish the entire staff.Misc.:-Elevators were being upgraded and it was really no big deal. We were on the 14th floor and only had to wait about 4-5 minutes a couple times. We justed talked to others waiting and learned some things we didn't know about the area.-We never ate int the restaurant but it looked nice. We did have a great meal at Sears next door one night.-We loved that the entire property was no smoking!!I think that about covers it but I'm probably forgetting some things. Hope this helps future visitors to San Francisco! Please stay at The Chancellor!! I would be happy to answer anybody's questions. I check this board frequently.Mike

<Content>Upsetting Experience My granddaugher and I were in SF over Chinese New Year/President's weekend. We arrived early, understood that the room may not be ready. We sent to lunch, came back around 2:15 - room not ready. Granddaughter feeling ill. We ask when can the room be ready, but never got a response back from the clerk or housekeeping. Around 2:45 I ask a different clerk when the room would be ready. Did not get response back from housekeeping or follow up by the desk clerk. Around 3:00 I ask yet another desk clerk when will the room be ready. She did give me a discount on the room as it was not ready on time, but at that point the money was not an issue - I just wanted a room, any room, as my granddaughter was feeling worse. Time passes ............ we finally get a room around after 3:30.But the keys do not work. Housekeeping has to open the door for us, but now my granddaughter is upset and starting to cry, I am upset, so we go down to the lobby and say we are not staying, we are leaving. The desk clerk says you are welcome to leave, but you must pay for the room. Needless to say, we are all upset at this time, and there is no talking to the deskclerk. So, we leave the hotel, and go home. We never stayed, we were in the room at most 30 seconds, we are upset due to the management staff, and yet we must pay for a room that we did not use. I felt that the management staff could have done better, that all they needed to do was follow up on my requests for a time when the room would be ready. In short, the Chancellor will never receive a recommendation from me.

<Content>If you love Europe, you'll love the Chancellor! We booked two rooms last week (Feb '05) based on reviews we read online. All I can say about those rare unhappy traveller reviews is that they must only like cookie cutter chain hotel rooms! The Chancellor is a piece of Europe in the heart of San Francisco. Clean, outstanding location, wonderful staff, ambience, and affordable! We brought another couple from Florida as a surprise for his birthday. Unknown to me, the staff put a chilled bottle of very good private-label wine in their room with a congratulatory card. A really CLASS touch! They have traveled extensively and were very happy with the Chancellor. Everything about this hotel is good old fashioned guest service -- thick, monogrammed towels, genuinely helpful and friendly staff, jar of candy in the room, fresh apples and cookies in the lobby, rubber duckies in the bathroom for your bath(!), and even an umbrella in the closet should the weather require! The rooms are on the small side, but that is typical of a hotel built 100 years ago (pay attention here all you people who want 1000 sq. ft. rooms!!!). Nonetheless, it was very adequate for two people and CLEAN. The elevator service was slow because they are renovating, and 1 of 2 were offline. But we still never had to wait more than 4 or 5 minutes. I have waited that long in big hotels with whole banks of elevators. It is well worth paying a few dollars extra for the valet parking! I think the only thing that did not impress me was the bartender on duty that night in the lobby bar. He was very lethargic and lacked the enthusiastic personality the rest of the staff exhibits. Maybe he was having a bad night. If not, they need to replace him or give him some Dale Carnegie lessons! If you are a light sleeper you'll want a higher level room -- lots of city noises including the cable cars. And don't forget to review their menu of pillow options! The most unique thing I've ever seen in a hotel. Awesome, convenient location. The cable cars are a must-do, fun experience. If you want Hyatt, pay the money and go get your cookie cutter room. If you want a unique experience, stay here!

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location My wife and I spent four nights at the Chancellor Hotel January 17-21. The location is excellent - right in the middle of everything. Street car line right in front of the hotel, BART station four blocks away. The price was outstanding for a downtown hotel - we even got our fourth night free. Room was small, but clean and functional, and hey, you don't go to San Francisco to spend a lot of time in your room! Only complaint was that even though it is a non-smoking hotel, someone was smoking in another room and the smoke was coming into our room through the bathroom ventilation. I guess if some idiot insists on smoking there's not much you can do about it, but at least the front desk responded quickly to our complaint and investigated, although they were not able to locate the source of the smoke. Overall this is a great hotel, with a great location, a great price, all in a great city. I would highly recommend the Chancellor Hotel.

<Content>Loved our stay!! The Chancellor was a great place for us to stay. We loved that Sears Fine Foods is next door. The staff was very friendly and the room was quite clean and very quiet(we were on the back side). Chinatown, Union Square and cable cars were very convenient. We will stay here again!!!!

<Content>great place to stay My daughter is a SF state university student and I like to fly down, we meet up for a couple nights and have fun in the city. Our last stay was at the Chancellor and we had a great time. It is close to the BART station, close to shops and restaurants, has cookies, fruit, coffee and tea in the lobby, the people were polite and the beds were comfortable. The price was terrific. Location is perfect. What more could you ask for?

<Content>Location Location Location! HiI am a single woman travelling on my own and I couldn't have chosen a better Hotel for safety and convenience. The Hotel is located right downtown and I used nearby public transport easily - cable cars, buses and the BART system. I also walked around the city and surrounding areas heaps and found so many attractions within walking distance - Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard St. Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul and many other tourist landmarks. I also walked to the Theatre on Green Street one night which was only a fifteen minute walk. I could easily have jumped on a cable car and been there in 5 minutes if I wanted but I really loved walking around taking in all the sights and sounds and smells. What a magical city!The Hotel was what I expected in a good way although the room was a little smaller than anticipated, but not tiny. If you ask to stay on a higher level you'll get a great view of the city or Union Square and as I was high up I opened the window at times just to hear the 'ting ting ting' of the cable cars. I love a good bath so the oversized bathtub was wonderful, especially after a long day sightseeing. Little extra touches like the complimentary 'help yourself' hot beverages, cookies and apples were greatly appreciated. The cookies were seriously some of the best I've ever tasted!Found the staff not particularly friendly or rude, just kind of 'neutral' which I think could be a point of improvement. They were efficient though which is important and when I requested a bar fridge for my room they had one there within 5 minutes. Also have to say the lady on the Tour Desk went out of her way to help me with information and directions and other such things so thanks to her! Many comments about the lift have already been written but I have to say it does make things a little inconvenient especially if you're staying on a higher floor. Seems this project has been ongoing for some time and before I stay there again I'd be keen to know when it will be rectified. Having said that I definitely would like to stay there again so I hope this will soon be fixed. The price is very reasonable considering the Hotel itself and its location and overall I would highly recommend the Chancellor. San Francisco is a wonderful city and if you're comtemplating whether to go or not - JUST DO IT!! I want to go back because there is SO much to do and see and the city itself is just so pretty. Locals were very helpful as well and I did not feel unsafe at any time which is important for anybody.

<Content>extremely neat hotel just returned from CA -- spent two nights at the chancellor hotel in SF. the location is absolutely perfect (great shopping, dining, and a great base for exploring the entire city). yes, one of the elevators was out of service, but we took this as an opportunity to chit chat with other guests while waiting for the functioning elevator. our room was VERY clean, staff extremely nice AND professional. thanks, monica, for assisting me with my reservation, and the nice front-desk guy who made our check-in very smooth (we arrived super late on thursday).mr. manager -- please don't yell at me, but it really DID get very hot one night, even thouth we had the window open and the fan on. i'm aware that it is not your fault, but the street artist with his saxophone did get a tiny bit annoying after a while :) does he prevent me from returning to the chancellor hotel? not a chance!

<Content>Nice Choice at a great price We stayed at the Chancellor on a Friday night in May 2004. The hotel is located right at Union Square which was great for shopping. I read in some reviews on Trip Advisor that it can be a bit noisy being situated right next to a cable car line. With that in mind I requested a room higher up to get us away from the street noise and the hotel staff was very accommodating. If you're sensitive to noise, I'd recommend asking for a room on the upper floors. The bedroom and bathroom were a bit small but everything was clean. Our breakfast at Luques Restaurant was enjoyable with good food and friendly wait staff. I'd recommend the Chancellor and stay there again.

<Content>our stay at chancellor After reading all the positive reviews on the Chancellor we decided to try it. We signed up for the family suite package as we were traveling with a child. Our one main criticism that actually made us leave was that there were no appropriate channels on the tv for kids, no vcr and no way to hook one up. I realize other people may not care about this but after a busy day of sightseeing, we like to relax and watch TV and we couldn't. I was surprised that there was no Disney channel or Nick or Cartoon network or any child friendly channel when they called it a family suite. It was also a bit too noisy for us as there was a street performer just under our window. We also had requested a refrigerator which was confirmed at least twice but when we got there we never got it. We moved to the Hyatt Embarcadero which all around was a better fit for us.

<Content>Wow what a surprise From reading about a zillion reviews before booking a hotel for myself and my 14 yr old daughter to spend a weekend shopping at Union Square in SF, I was expecting a small but quaint, fairly clean room with a great location. I got all of that, but the room wasn't just fairly clean it was spotless. I accidently spilled a 1/2 gallon of bottled water on the carpet and anyone who has spilled something on carpet knows you blot it up, not wipe it up, well, I grabbed a couple of bathtowels and started blotting... the towels were soaked but quess what?? NO DIRT, NONE. The carpets had to have been cleaned or the towels would have been dirty. I was impressed the room smelt clean when we first entered, and it was. The location was excellent for shopping with my teenager and the valet parking was included with the room, so we didn't have to fight traffic, we just bought a three day muni pass and zoomed around town on the cable cars. The people where very helpful in the hotel and one of the elevators was broken and being repaired, but our wait for an elevator at the longest busiest time was never more than 5-6 minutes top. The price was great, the service was great and the room clean, it was a safe location, and for the price you cannot get a better deal.

<Content>Pretty good value Amazing location. One elevator was unavailable the entire time we were there (Dec 25 - 29th). The other one only held 6 people and was quite slow. There is a scary sign at the entrance about the building containing some sorts of hazardous materials that can cause cancer or something. Rooms are good, since if ur on vacation u don't plan on spending a lot of time there.

<Content>Good Experience We stayed at the Chancellor over the christmas holidays in dec '04. It was a very good experience - the hotel is charming, the staff is helpful and nice. The only complaint is that there was only one elevator working...so i would check to see if the second elevator is working before making a reservation on one of the higher floors. The location was amazing - we had never been to san fran before and the cable car ride to the wharf was right across the street. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that was traveling to san francisco (and especially if they're looking to shop!).

<Content>Hotel is a good value My husband and I stayed at The Chancellor in mid-November and were relatively pleased with our 2-night stay. Its best feature: no locked-out hotel workers striking in front of it to harass you and other guests! (I sympathize with the workers, but they sure made SF look bad.)You cannot beat this hotel for location and price, given the rates of other Union Square lodging choices. It really is right on the street car line and is within walking distance of China Town, MoMA, etc.I don't know that I would stay at The Chancellor in the summer (no a/c and we never could figure out how to open the windows so it may be impossible), but for autumnal afternoon temperatures in the 60's and evening lows in the 50's, it was just fine. Ventilation in the bathroom was poor, but given the hotel's age, I was not surprised. It was clean and tidy, even if the room was small; there was enough space for us and our luggage. My only real complaint is that it would be nice to have some color in the room - we had whitewash everywhere with the furniture  carpet providing the only relief (I don't count the 2 tiny prints on the wall, nor do I count the wallpaper border in the bath). Our view over Powell Street was fine. The staff was nice, although the Asian woman at the information desk in the lobby was probably the least enthusiastic person I have ever met in my life. Someone wake this lady up!Thanks to the reviewer who recommended Sears Fine Food in a review on this site - we ate breakfast there and it is GREAT. And right next door to the hotel, so you have an advantage in terms of proximity. Get there early, though; the joint had a line 25 people deep at 8:00 a.m.! Another good breakfast place is Lory's Diner; there are, like, 5 locations within 3 blocks of The Chancellor.Lastly, be advised: if you're booking this hotel through an online service like Expedia or Orbitz, you will NOT be getting the sample European-themed room with the beautiful white canopied bed that is shown on those websites. You'll get a much plainer room. But it will still be clean!

<Content>Couldn't better the location Only just got around to writing this review. We stayed here in June for 4 nights after chosing it based on other tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed. Yes the rooms are small but then how long do you spend in your hotel room in a city such as San Francisco? And if want a quiet hotel why are you staying in heart of a major city? Our hotel overlooked Union Square but we didn't have any problems sleeping. The location of the hotel couldn't be better - right in heart of the city.I really don't think you can fault this hotel for its facilities and location for the price - if you want 5 star luxury stay at Westin St Francis but if want a clean, friendly hotel that doesn't break the budget then stay at the Chancellor. If we ever return to San Francisco which I sincerely hope we will as I loved the city then this will be our first choice of hotel.On another note we also bought a three day Muni pass which was excellent value - the city is too large to travel on foot and having this pass meant we could hop on and off transport without having to fiddle about for change - we must have had at least 3 times the value in journeys.

<Content>Great Location, good value I was very pleased with this hotel. San Francisco has so many choices that it can be somewhat overwhelming, but my husband and I were happy with our choice. The location is right in the hub of the city,and we were even able to take the bart to the Powell St. station from SFO. It was only 4 blocks to the hotel from the station and cost $4.95 per person as opposed to the shuttles which were about $12 to $14. You can buy cable car passes right in the lobby also. The rooms were small, but very clean and nice. Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Loved the chancellor Recommend it highly. Chose it on basis of price, location, and trip advisor reviews. Location was great, rooms fine (a list of ten kinds of pillows to choose from!), and staff superlative - friendly, helpful, and appearing to genuinely enjoy their jobs. The woman on the bar went so far as to get someone to 'google' something for us to settle our debate on something. Only caution - the cable cars run down the hill in front of the hotel, and union square is busy, so you must either close your window or sleep heavily. Aside from that, can't imagine why you wouldn't be very glad indeed to stay there.

<Content>A Great Value! First of all, I want to thank everyone who has posted on Tripadvisor.com. All the posts here were priceless in helping me make a decision on a hotel in San Francisco. My wife and I recently spent 4 nights at the Chancellor Hotel on Union Square and it was everything that everbody on this board said it was. The hotel is old and the rooms are small (especially the bathroom), but it was more than adequate for our stay. Our room was clean and comfortable with a king size bed, overlooking Powell Street. The bells of the cable cars lulled us to sleep at night!The Union Square location was incredible. We were within walking distance to some world class shopping and plenty of restaurants in all categories. We purchased a 3 day Muni pass ($15), which I highly recommend, and we were able to take advantage of San Francisco's incredible public transportation system including the cable cars. We took advantage of the pillow menu and each ordered specialty pillows. There is no air conditioning here so I wouldn't want to stay in the hot weather, but the ceiling fan was fine in November. Also, because of the size of the rooms, I wouldn't suggest staying with a family. From the time I called and made a reservation to the minute the bellman took our luggage out to the shuttle van upon departure, the staff was absolutely superb. Very friendly, helpful and down to earth. I'm almost embarrassed to say that I paid a ridiculous $89 a night! The Chancellor is definitely a hidden gem. If you're travelling on a budget, like we were, I highly recommend the Chancellor on Union Square. If anyone needs further information about this hotel or location, feel free to email me.

<Content>Good Choice We just stayed at the Chancellor for 5 nights. It is a wonderful hotel, great staff, very helpful, clean rooms. The rooms are not huge, but very comfortable. They were able to accomodate us with an infant by providing a crib and a mini fridge at no extra charge. The location cannot be beat with the cable car right outside, tons of restaurants and being right in the middle of downtown. The also provided an excellent map of the city.I only have 2 small issues- the parking was expensive at $25 per night off site ($22 plus a $3+ tax) and room service is not available every night of the week.Other reviews here mention the elevators being slow- I thought they were fine. In addition, they are currently upgrading the elevator system.Also, I recommend Scala's restaturnat right across the street. The risotto was out of this world!

<Content>Believe the Positive Posts! I must have read over 125+ reviews in this forum before taking a chance and booking The Chancellor. I now feel that I need to give back to this forum.First let's get past the cons of this hotel. If you are looking for very large room with extremely nice decor, you are not going to find it here. If you need to sleep in a room that is 100% quiet without any street noise, you are not going to find it here. If you are used to staying at a 5-star, this is NOT the place for you!My wife and I just returned from a five night/six day trip to San Francisco (part vacation and part work ... for me at least!). We arrived early Tuesday morning (11/02/2004) and took the BART to Market/Powell station. Cost is only $4.95 per person. This is cheap in comparison to a shuttle for $12.50 or a taxi for approximately $40 plus tip. The trip was about 30-45 minutes long. Upon exiting the station, we needed to walk 4 blocks up a slight hill to get to the hotel. We arrived at approximately 9:00AM and proceeded to check in. We were told that the specific room that we had requested (queen with a view of Union Square) was not available yet, but we were offered the option of getting a room that was available immediately. Now tell me, when was the last time you arrived at a hotel that early and was offered an immediate check in? We decline and stored out luggage and proceeded to sightsee.The location of the Hotel is on Powell between Post and Sutter. The cable car stop is located right outside the hotel, with the start point at Market and Powell. The cable car is fun to ride but access to different parts of SF are limited. Also, at $3 per person, the Muni system at $1.25 with at least a 90-minute transfer is really the way to travel around the city. Unless you are used to the stress of driving in a very congested city, don't even think about using a car around town (more about this later). Several Muni bus stops are located not more than 2 blocks from the hotel.After doing some sightseeing, we checked into our room at about 2:00pm. I must say, that ALL the employees of the hotel were extremely nice and friendly and willing to answer any questions and help in most any way. We should know, because we were constantly asking about transportation, eating and questions in general. We wound up in a corner room (1003), located around the corner from the elevators and the ice machine at the far end of the hall. On one side there was another room (we did not hear anything next door for the entire time we were there) and opposite was the emergency exit to the fire escape. We overlooked Powell and were able to see Union Square from our window. The first thing that my wife and I did was race to the bathroom to see if we had a rubber duckie waiting for us and sure enough, there it was! The bathroom was on the small side, with the toilet such that opening and closing the door while seated would be difficult. The tub, however, was a large and deep cast iron one. Since neither my wife nor myself planned on spending any significant time in this room, we were able to easily overlook any shortcomings.The room itself was much larger than I had imagined based upon the reviews that I had read. I was expecting a room slightly larger than a cabin on a cruise ship! We had a queen bed, a desk and chair and a table at the window with 2 additional chairs. Yes, it is true that there isn't any air conditioning (just a ceiling fan), but at this time of year, none was needed. And yes, the carpet was a bit warn, but it was clean and I didn't plan on doing anything other than walk on it. We did happen to get a glimpse of another room, and it did appear to be somewhat smaller than ours. I guess the corner room might offer a little more space.Although there was only a 3-draw dresser to store clothes, the closet in the room was a walk in! Plenty of room to hang stuff and store unneeded luggage. Also, it contained extra pillows, blankets and an umbrella, not to mention a digital security safe.The Pillow Menu is for real! My wife and I tried a number of different pillows during our stay. Our favorite was the 鈥淏etween the Knees鈥?pillow. We also asked for and received a noise machine. We kept our window all the time. We were able to hear noise from the street, but mostly during the day and somewhat at night (cable car, occasional car horn, and crowds). I guess it was heightened by the fact that many hotel workers were on strike and you could somewhat hear their chants. Bottom line, though, was that I was so exhausted by the time we came back to the room, that we both slept like rocks (the beds are comfortable and very, very clean).I actually booked my hotel stay on Travelocity. The daily rates provided by Travelocity were better than those that I received directly from the hotel ($99 TWTh, $125 F, $145 Sat). Travelocity even gave me a FREE night ($89 TWTh, Free Fri, $125 Sat). My 5-night stay was approximately $455 with taxes and fees. The hotel also has either on-sight valet or off-sight self-parking for an additional fee (I think for an additional daily fee of $30 and $20, respectively). You can come and go as often as you like. Travelocity, however, offered the on-sight valet parking for only an additional $18 per night. This beats the average going rate of $25, and that usually does not allow unlimited in and out).The hotel鈥檚 apple bowl is always full and on occasion even cookies are available at no charge. The apples were a great snack to hold us over until our meals. We did not try either room service or the hotel restaurant.The following is additional information for those that are interested.We rented a car for one day to travel outside the city. We went to Monterey and visited the aquarium (awesome!) and we took the 17-Mile drive in Carmel (wonderful views). The car rental place is located 3 blocks from the hotel (220 O鈥橣arrell). There was Alamo, National and Budget. I reserved using Orbitz (where I usually find the best rates) and got a Saturday daily rate of $30 (the weekday rates ranged between $26 and $28) for a compact. At the rental place, they offered us a convertible (Sebring) for an additional $10. It was just what we needed for a sunny drive. The drive was about 120 miles and took 2 hours. Since the rental place was closed by the time we returned Saturday night, we needed to park the car until the morning. The parking lot on the corner where we rented from charged only $12.50 for the late night special (in by 7:30PM out by 9:30AM). Very cheap!As I said before, I would not use a car to get around in the city. Our stress level went from zero to 10 when we returned on Saturday night. Driving in an unfamiliar city at night is hard, to say the least. Then you have to deal with the wacky street directions, which do not permit left-hand turns across traffic on many streets. When we were only about 5 blocks from the parking lot, it took us literally 45 minutes to get there, making a lot of right hand turns!China Town is located a few short blocks away. And above that is Little Italy. We had the best rotisserie chicken and pasta at Gira Polli, located at Union and Stockton. Not only was the food good and reasonably priced, but the staff was friendly and the owner Noreen spent almost 30 minutes talking with us after we had paid our bill! Also at that location, on Stockton, you will find a great Italian bakery (??) and an extremely good gelato place (Sue鈥檚 Fruits?). There is also a magnificent church to visit diagonally across the street. For pizza, try Golden Boy. Pretty good (compared to NYC)!Since we live in a land locked state, it is always a treat for us to get fresh fish. Personally, my wife and I no longer go out to eat fish where we live. For the same amount of money, we splurge and get our seafood from Whole Foods (where we know that it has not been previously frozen) and cook it at home. Same amount of money spent, but it all went into the price of the fish! We ate sushi at a nearby restaurant (2 blocks from the hotel) on the corner of Sutter and Mason. Sushi is at it鈥檚 best when it is made with fresh fish! Now, for the most part, Fisherman鈥檚 Warf is a tourist trap. We did, however, go with some locals to Scoma鈥檚, which is rated as one of the best seafood restaurants in SF. Plan on spending about $50 per person, but well worth every cent!You haven鈥檛 been to SF unless you have had Dim Sum! Probably the best Dim Sum restaurant is Yang Sing (2 locations). Plan on approximately $20-$25 per person, again, worth every cent for the food and experience!We also ate at a great french resturant called Le Centrale, located just opposite the gates to China town.Finally, the museums --- Most are free the first Tuesday or Wednesday of the month. Some others are free one day a week. The Legion of Honor (near the Presidio) is a great museum for those that are into paintings and sculpture. They have a very large collection of Renaissance artists and one of the largest collections of Rodan sculptures. The Exporatorium located between Golden Gate Park and the Presidio is an excellent hands on museum. My wife and I had a blast there! While in the area, there is really great Teih and Vietnamese food (real hole in the wall authentic!).We also went to Alcatraz. I wasn鈥檛 sure if this was going to be cheesy, but it turned out to be a very informative trip. The National Park Service runs it. We spent about 3 hours (including the ferry). Cost is $16 per person (including ferry and audio). Unfortunately we did not have nearly enough time to see many of the other museums that SF has to offer.Our only bad experience was at the very end of our trip. We took a taxi to the airport (SFO). The fare should have been between $36 and $40. Our driver told us that 101 was backed up with an estimated time of 1-1/2 hours. He took us around the horn (I-280) for an ultimate fare of $52. I do not really think that highway 101 had any traffic early Sunday afternoon. I guess when they ask where you are from, the response should always be 鈥渇rom here.鈥?br/>Overall, a fantastic trip. If we were to come here again, I would not hesitate to stay at the Chancellor again!

<Content>Excellent stay We spent 4 nights at the Chancellor in October 2004. The rooms weren't excessively large but everything that we needed was there plus a few things that weren't needed but made the stay more fun (sweets and a rubber duck!). We were on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel but were never disturbed by road noise. The bar was comfortable and the restaurant food very good. Coffee and biscuits in the reception area were a treat. The location is ideal for exploring the city. A Muni pass is a must.

<Content>Great Place to Stay What a great location for any trip to San Francisco. If you like large rooms, this is not the hotel for you (nor are most hotels in SF). But, if you like clean, comfortable, and convenient, with a very European feel and excellent service, this hotel is fabulous. Also, its restaurant has wonderful food (Luques). Great rates (the hotel matched the lowest rate we found on expedia) and valet parking service was prompt and professional. Wonderful location for shopping (one block from Union Square) and sightseeing (on cable car route). If you choose to book, request a room streetside 9th floor or above (15 floors) for direct sunlight, view and much less curb noice. On 12th floor, the street sounds were romantic, not annoying. We travel to San Francisco for pleasure at least 3 times per year and will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Chancellor I just got home from a fabulous first visit to San Francisco and I have to say my stay at the Chancellor was more than great. I used trip advisor as a guide in picking out a hotel, still I was not sure I made the right decision... Once I got to Chancellor I knew immediately that I made a great decision. First the location is unbelievable, in the heart of Union Square where the best shopping is with the fanciest stores anyone can imagine, close to the best public transportation in the US. I am from Chicago and I thought we have good public transportation but that was until I got to SF and I used MUNI absolutely everywhere from one end of the town to the other, great connection with minimum wait, get MUNI pass it's also good for the cable car which happen to have a stop right in front of the hotel.Chancellor Hotel... friendly staff with a great sense of humor, rarely found anywhere else. To check in took exactly 2 minutes, I guess they also know what they are doing...:) Elevators, every entry that mentioned the elevators were saying they are slow, let me tell you the elevators are fine, true it's not like the Devil's drop at Great America but they work just fine, and you know what if you think these are slow evators than go to Europe and I would love to hear one's opinion than. Europe's elevator have the speed of a snail race, that is if the elevator works at all. The rooms... When I opened the door I expected to enter this room a bit bigger than a closet, considering everyone mentioned how small the rooms are, Well... the rooms are perfect, actally I was a little surprised to see that was not small at all. From the room we had a great view of the union square. The beds were so comfortable and sooooooo clean. I am a very picky person who ALWAYS checks every layer of the bed sheets making sure it's clean and no surprises. I was surprised but this time it was because beds were so white, crisp, clean NO funny smell... Bathroom, again very, very clean, very well stocked, even Q-tips, and yes the ruber ducky was there waiting for us, nice touch. In the lobby, 24 hours hot coffe, tea, fresh homemade cookies, yummmm and fresh apples... Great way to start your day with.Overall I have to say I was very satisfyied with my stay at the Chancellor. Next time in San Francisco, I can guarantee I will be checking in at the Chancellor. And for the management: Congratulation on a great staff you have, keep them happy, they deserve it, afterall they keep your customers happy and I am sure you know that is not always an easy task... God Bless! :)

<Content>Perfect Location! My wife and I stayed at the Chancellor back in July. I couldnt say more about the hotel. They were very curteous, and after we checked in, they sent a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room. The pillow menu was great, and the location was perfect! Walk across the street to a cable car, lots of friendly little diners in the area too. If we ever go back to San Francisco, we would stay there again. It was a charming little boutique hotel!

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed for 3 days at the Chancellor in late september. It is really a nice place to stay in SF. Perfectly located, just one block away from Union square. The hotel has an old fashion style which in our opinion is very charming. The location is excellent: you just walk out the door and you allready see the cable cars in front of you! Your in the heart of the city, just one block from Union square.Our room was not to big, but had everything you need:nice bad, a clean bathroom, TV (HBO), safe.Roomservice and desk were very friendly and helpfull. At the lobby you always find free coffee and cookies. A little shop is also there. Breakfast is not cheap but excellent.We had booked the self-parking, which in my opinion is better then the valet-parking: you just walk one block to the parking lot and pick up your car whenever you want, valet-parking takes some time especially at check-out time.We would stay there again at any time.

<Content>Great location and value My wife and I stayed at the Chancellor from 9/30/04 - 10/4/04 and couldn't have enjoyed it more. The location is excellent and the Union Square area is full of excellent dining and shopping choices. We especially enjoyed the Chancellor's free pillow menu - our favorite was the Buckwheat pillow which guaranteed a good night's rest. The Chancellor has a small hotel feel and it is a charming place to stay. We would stay at the Chancellor again with no hesitation. The only downside to San Francisco is parking which is costly - $ 30 per day for valet parking.

<Content>Great Experience Because of the price I didn't expect much from this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised! I used the reviews from this site to make my choice and I was very pleased. The hotel's location was incredible, right in the middle of great shopping. I felt safe in the hotel as well as outside on the street even after dark. You can catch the trolley right in front of the hotel and their is a great breakfast place, Sear's, next door. Two blocks away is some of the best pizza I've ever had Uncle Vito's. Our room was small but clean and had lot's of cute details including an umbrella and a rubber ducky in the bathroom. The hotel itself is beautiful. The staff was so nice and truly seemed to care about our experience in their hotel. I will agree with the other reviews that the water pressure needs a little work though. I will glady stay there again and plan to recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Good I really quite liked this hotel. It had a certain charm but don't ask me why. This hotel is ideally located in Union Square and is close to the main tram stop at the bottom of Powell Street. The bay area will take around 30 minutes to walk but trust me the queue for the trams are usually much longer.I found the room very spacious and cleanliness of this hotel very good. For the price, I found it good value and had a pleasant stay.

<Content>A very pleasant stay My wife and I, along with our 7 month old baby and 3 year old daughter stayed in at the Chancellor for 6 nights in September. We did our research beforehand on this website and the hotel was exactly what we expected. The Chancellor provides great value in an excellent location. The weather was a bit too warm for our liking, and so, if travelling with children, keep in mind that this hotel has no air conditioning. Nevertheless, it does have a ceiling fan, and our request for a fan was dealt with promptly. We had a room on the top floor overlooking Union Square, and noise was not a big factor for us.Particularly nice was the bellhop who brought my delayed luggage up and addressed me by my name, and then remembered it for the duration of the stay - made me feel like a VIP!Other things that we liked - we had a small bar fridge put in our room - very useful when travelling with a baby; the free newspapers were great (NY Times, SF Chronicle, USA Today) as were the free coffee/tea/cookies; the room safe was very useful.Overall a very enjoyable stay at the Chancellor!

<Content>Like staying at a friend's house! I just returned from a three night stay at the Chancellor Hotel. I felt very welcome there -- it was almost like staying in the spare bedroom at a friend's house. From the moment I checked in, EVERYONE was very friendly. Of course, the hotel is small-ish, and cozy, but, I went to San Francisco to see the city, not to stay in an overpriced, stuffy chain hotel with a staff that's too fabulous to deal with me. For the price, location, and comfort, I'd TOTALLY stay there again. (And not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.)The only real low point of my trip was the picketing neighbor hotels. I could hear them when I went to sleep, and they woke me up around 6:30 every morning. I can't blame the Chancellor Hotel, though. Actually, the staff was so great, I believe that if there WAS something they could've done about the noise, they would've done it.

<Content>Extremely Pleased I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Chancelor in San Francisco and I couldn't be happier with the building, location and service we recieved. The hotel is extremely clean and right in the heart of Union Square. From there it was very easy to use public transportation to get to all of the outlying neighborhoods we wanted to visit. The staff was friendly and knowledgable. Although we didn't eat at the restaurant, the food looked great and prices were in line with other restaurants in the area. We visited while a hotel workers strike was going on at some of the larger hotels and from our room in the back of the Chancelor, the noise was minimal. I really pitied the people who paid top dollar to stay at one of those establishments and then were assalted with banging drums and air horns from 6AM to 10PM each day. I have been burned in the past by booking a hotel sight unseen on the internet but this one turned out to be a real gem. You don't have to worry, all the good things that you hear and read about the Chancelor are true.

<Content>Great location and price The Chancellor Hotel on Union Square is a great location to visit San Francisco. Cable car stop right outside the entrance. The room we were in was small, but comfortable, clean and we loved the Rubber Duck. Tried their pillow menu. I got the snore-no-more and my wife appreciated it! WI-FI access in lobby bar. Staff were great, very helpfull. The price was great- paid $120 per night including valet parking.

<Content>Excellent Location  We stayed in the Chancellor Hotel at the beginning of September as part of a four city break in the USA (Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco and New York). The hotel was excellent value and only seconds away from the cable car stop. The extra touches like the rubber duck in the bath room (I didn't realise I could take it home!), and the jar of sweeties made me smile, as it felt that the management had put some thought into how they can make their hotel unique and memorable, offering extra services at reasonable prices. I found this a welcoming change after the annoymous but very plesant stays in the larger chain hotels we stayed in (Wyndham, the Mirage and W). For the price and location the Chacellor was excellent value, I knew what to expect as the hotel looks exactly like it appears on the hotel website. The Chancellor was also extremely helpful when we needed to cash travellers cheques. A superb base to explore San Francisco!

<Content>Great location, but... You certainly can't beat the Union Square location for the price, but there were some disappointments which may have been largely circumstantial for us, to be fair. We got a package deal through Travelocity, which gave us a 4th floor room overlooking the tops of some lower buildings either behind or next door with loud fans and generators which, with the window open, could have kept anyone up all night. On top of that, it was boiling all weekend, unnaturally hot for SF, and there was no air conditioning at all, just a ceiling fan, which made for an uncomfortable night's sleep with the windows closed to keep out the noise. Slightly tacky and a little unnerving was the little tour booth in the lobby. The vibe coming from it seemed a little desperate to push its wares and services on you rather than quietly accomodating, as a regular concierge would have been. The front desk was excellent, though, and everyone was very pleasant and ready to help. Breakfast was pretty good, too!

<Content>definitely not elegant but inexpensive and convenient The Chancellor is in a fantastic location for sight seeing and convenience. Nice staff. It is not nearly as pretty as other small Union Square hotels we've stayed at and loved: the Kensington Park and the Warwick Regis. The chancellor is definitely no frills. Bathroom has vinyl and linoleum, old looking grout, and plastic tub. No marble or ceramics here. The room is PERFECTLY clean but quite unimaginative. No lovely little touches- chairs are old and bedding is plain. The tv sits on the dresser, is not housed in an armoire or anything. I think it looked like a very clean and cheaply decorated Motel 6. HOWEVER it is about $40 a night CHEAPER than anywhere else we've stayed and we loved spending that money on play tix instead, etc. If you were staying several nights the savings would be considerable. It is probably not the place to hole up in for a romantic snuggly weekend. But if you are interested in seeing the whole town this is a perfect and inexpensive place to lay down your head.

<Content>Great location! Stayed at the Chancellor for 5 nights at the end of August -- clean and comfortable room and good value for money. The real selling point of this place is its location, right on Union Square and central to the fun things and to shopping! Trams run right outside to take you to Fisherman's warf and although my room faced the road/tram lines it wasn't noisy at all.Things spring to mind that I'll tell friends that go to San Francisco: Fisherman's Warf didn't strike me as a great place to stay, there is not a whole lot to do there that you can't do in one afternoon and I'm glad that I didn't spend the extra money; for only $35ish for the whole day and a ferry back, renting a bike is a great way to explore north of San Francisco and its great to cycle across the golden gate bridge (hardly any of it is uphill by the way -- you'll appreciate this when you get there and realise quite how hilly it actually is!); there is a show called Beach Blanket Babylon which is a hilariously funny topical musical and well worth seeing whilst you're there -- most tickets are sold out at least two days in advance unless you want to queue at 5 or 6am.Oh, and if you're staying at the Chancellor, you can get a much better deal on breakfast (average food, average cost) by going next door to Sears which is apparently world famous for its pancakes. I don't know about that but they are delicious and not as expensive as at the hotel!

<Content>Average- Good value-I guess We visited the hotel in July 2004. The hotel is in the perfect location- Right by union square. With regards to the room quality and size, I found it a little disappointing. The bathroom is very small. We are not in San Francisco to stay in the room but we all like to have a fairly spacious area. I felt confined and clustered. The price is great with regards to the location. The restaurant in the looby is very quite and the bar is small. If you are there to relax and take it easy, it is a good value hotel. If you are young and looking for a liitle action, I recommend you go the Sir Drake Hotel instead which is just across the street. Other than that I must conclude that I am satisfied, not anything more.

<Content>Great Location The Chancellor is one of the best located hotels I've ever stayed in. Right in Union Square, you are just steps from great stores and it's a fantastic starting point for sightseeing.I didn't know what to expect from the hotel, but was pleasantly surprised with the room. It's not huge, but the bed is big and comfortable, and the closet seems to go on forever!The bathroom is a good size, and like others I found the rubber ducky an amusing bonus. You can also choose from a menu for pillows! Sadly I didn't get chance to sample the range on offer.My only negative feedback would be for the front desk. While the staff were polite, I did have to wait a while to be seen on more than one occasion. Having said that, the lady who books the tourist trips must surely be the friendliest hotel employee in the world!I had stayed at another hotel in the city on a previous visit which was shabby, in a menacing part of town and not worth the money. By contrast, The Chancellor is bright, safe and perfectly placed!

<Content>The price is right! After we paid $60 dollers a night for 4 nights in mid July 04 I checked this site and thought there must be two hotels of this name and we had paid for a dud !!To be honest we visited the City last summer and knew the location but where still worried there had been a mistake with the price , but no. This is an excellent hotel no matter which part of the service you look at, the rooms, staff, public areas even the normally surly reception staff where up-beat, friendly and helpful.I would have no problem in recommending this property, we paid $280 a night for a suite in a Hyatt in San Diego and as nice as it was the Chancellor was better.

<Content>Best Hotel in SF I have stayed at the Chancellor Hotel at least three times in the last 12 mos, the most recent being in June 2004. I enjoy it more every time. The rooms and towels are clean, and the candy dish and rubber ducky in the room are something you just don't get anywhere else. I've tried a bunch of pillows from the pillow menu, which is fun. The Chancellor will also give you a free pass to use the gym next door at the St. Francis Hotel, but people staying at the St. Francis have to pay to use it! Now that's a great deal, especially considering how much less a room at the Chancellor costs. My only complaint is that the free cookies and tea and coffee in the lobby are too tempting, which is not really a complaint at all. This is a great hotel!

<Content>Good value We paid $109 for our twin room. The room was small but adequate but the ceiling fan was not enought to cool the room. We kept the curtains closed for most of the day but it was still hot at night. The bathroom is very small but the location made up for any downfalls. The cable car is on the doorstep and Union Square is a two minute walk away. The constant supply of coffee, cookies and superb fresh apples helped the budget. The staff were helpful and courteous with a lobby shop that sells transport tickets. The hotel is very near diners and all that San Francisco has to offer. A tip, ask for a quiet room at the rear of the hotel, no view but a peaceful sleep.

<Content>you get more than you pay for We stayed at the Chancellor for a weekend in the Fall of 2003. At $89 a night on a weekend we were not expecting much out of the hotel, but with the prime central location, we couldnt pass it up. This hotel exceeded our expectations. While the room was tiny, it was nothing to complain about considering the steal in price. The view from our room was great, you are right in the heart of Union Square, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were spotless and the tubs were big. This is by no means a luxurious hotel, but I really feel that we got far more than what we paid for at this hotel. When traveling on a budget, we will never stay anywhere else but here in the city. It is a GREAT DEAL!

<Content>Comfortable and great value We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chancellor and agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews. Great location, especially if you have a short stay in S. Francisco and want to be handy for all the attractions - just across the Square from Macy's. We stayed on the fifth floor at the back and as the hotel is older in style the solid walls meant that it was very quiet and we heard no noise at all. Perhaps the bathroom could be a bit bigger and more modern but it was clean and functional. We liked the free jar of sweets in our room! Also the free coffee/tea at the reception area and the super cookies baked fresh every day. Found the staff helpful. We would stay here again if we were returning to S.F. Good value.

<Content>What a place to spend a weekend!!! Well, where do I start - four of us came to stay at the Chancellor Hotel for 5 nights in mid-June and loved every minute of it! Check in was quick and polite, the rooms were very comfortable. But it was the extras that really made it - I ordered one of the special pillows from their selection. It arrived within 10 minutes. My Mum hired a foot spa from their range of relaxation products and said it was worth every penny of the $5 she paid after walking up and down the hills all day!!! The little touches in the rooms - the jar of sweets on the table, the rubber duck in the bathroom and the helpful and friendly staff give this hotel a personal feel which you don't always get in other hotels. The location was outstanding, so close to the shops and you could jump on a cable car right outside the front door. The restaurants in the area were superb and very varied - from Uncle Vito's just up the road, the Tempura House and Lori's diner, we never had a bad meal during our entire stay. We were a short walk from Chinatown and had every amenity close by (drugstores and laundromats very handy).The lady at the tour desk in the hotel was really helpful and we booked a trip to Napa, a city tour and our airport shuttle with her - all of which were excellent and collected us right on time. The restaurant was great, with a good choice of breakfast dishes, and really cute coffee mugs which you can buy as a souvenir of your stay (and we did!!!) We had spent two weeks in the U.S, first in New York and then in Las Vegas before arriving here, and this was just the best way to finish our trip. We had never been to San Francisco before, but I can guarantee we will be coming back and will be staying here again for sure. This was a quality place and well worth every penny. Next time we are planning our trip this will be the first place I book, just to make sure we get a room!Well done Chancellor Hotel!!!

<Content>We will return next year. Family vacation to San Francisco and we are going to return to this wonderful city. Stayed 6/12 6-15. Used this site to 'hunt' for a suitable hotel location. Worried a bit that these reviews are overblown, but not having a better option, I went with the sites recomendations and landed on the Chancellor. For others reading this I can now say 'rest easy' there is little risk with the Chancellor. I travel a lot and stay in all kinds of hotels all over the country. What I say next comes from 65 - 80 nights on the road per year. The Chancellor is not 'perfect' but if your goal is to find a safe, clean, friendly place, with professional staff in a great location and at a price that allows you to focus your resources on seeing the City and doing the other things without feeling buyers remorse, then this place will meet that goal. This hotel is older (1914), designed and built in a different era. It lacks the modern uniformity and the cookie cutter design approach of a Westin or Hyatt or Hilton. Hallways are narrow and twist and turn. The elevator is small, older and a bit slow for a traveling type 'A' like me, but hey, use the steps to go down. With that said, this hotel is as clean and quiet if not cleaner and a more quiet hotel than that of the larger more expensive hotel chains found elsewhere. Rooms are smallish but at this price do what we did, get two adjoining rooms. Room for all !! Great rest - beds are clean and comfortable - at a very good price.Great Location. Can walk around as its a safe area - a few beggars perhaps, but this is a large American city not unlike any other large American city in that regard. Easy acess to cable cars, taxis and BART - no need for a car while in the City. Fun tip : Rent the Blazing Saddle bikes and ride across the GG Bridge. Yolanda the desk person ( who assisted with our extra nights stay ) and Matt the Bellman ( who secured me an extra rubber duck) were names I recall for service. I can't recall anyone else at any other hotel I've stayed at over the past year. Can you? It's that kind of place.

<Content>The Chancellor: I only wish I could have stayed longer! I stayed at the Chancellor after reveiwing tons of hotels on this site. I was not disappointed. I did book directly through the hotels website though, and would recommend that as the price was better than any other site. I paid 89 for my night, 101 after the taxes. That was an excellent deal for the place as my 13th floor room overlooked Union Square. Some other reviewers complained about noise, but the only problem I had was when my neighbors had their television up a little loud. With the window closed, I couldn't even really hear the street noise. I am a great lover of SF, so the cable car bell was actually charming to me.I found the decor to be tasteful. They avoided that crappy fake border/stencil stuff that many other hotels try to pass off as decorating. The room was impeccably clean, with opening windows, a ceiling fan which cut any warmth and black out curtains that made the room almost pitch black in the middle of the day if one so desired. There was also a deep tub that I took full advantage of. Others have complained about the size of the room, but for one or two people, it was quite comfortable. Besides, you're in the city, why stay in the room if you don't have to!? The hotel staff was excellent and friendly. I was able to check in a full 2 hours early after a quick email to the hotel site. The service, even just on their website, was prompt and courteous. They held my luggage after checkout because I had a couple of hours to kill before leaving. There are a bounty of shops, restaurants and entertainment within easy walking distance and the public transportation is almost ridiculously easy to use. If you need a refrigerator in your room, request it ahead of time because mine didn't come with one. That is really my only complaint. I just wish I could have stayed longer. I loved the Chancellor and would recommend it to anyone. You aren't going to find a better deal for the price.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for one night this month (June 2004) after reading countless good reviews on this website, and these positive reviews were right on... the hotel is perfectly located, in the heart of Union Square, and it's close to many restaurants and shops -- and right on the cable car line. The staff is friendly and the coffee and cookies in the lobby are an extra perk. The rooms are small, but clean -- and the pillows are good! If you're looking for the Four Seasons this isn't it, but I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune yet wants to be in the heart of San Francisco in a nice place. An excellent value.

<Content>Great location and value Stayed here for 4 nights in March this year after reading the reviews on this website. The location is great for an easy walk to all the central stores and restaurants and is right on the main cable car route.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the accomodation was fine, although the room was more European in size and not the typical king size of corporate hotels. Hotel restaurant was adequate for breakfast at an average $12-15 cost per person.Room rates were good at $99. Would definitely stay here again just for it's location.

<Content>Definately Recommended We booked at the Chancelor after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed; we were there over the Memorial Day Weekend. The room was small, but plenty big enough to get changed and sleep - which is all you need it for anyway! Good bed/pillows, very clean and the staff were outstanding - we were travelling in California for 2 weeks and the Chancelor staff were way above average from other places we stayed. We asked if there was a mini fridge in our room when we arrived and there wasn't, BUT within 10 minutes of getting into our room, one was brought up. Very impressive. During our 3 day stay, we asked front desk staff about a number of things (places to go/eat) and all recommendations were perfect. The only thing I regret about writing this review is that the Chancelor just might get too popular! We will stay there when we return to San Fran!

<Content>Helpful staff, great location! Moved to the Chancellor from another hotel to save money and the first thing they did for us was give us a lower rate because we were staying for 6 nights, so we saved more than expected! We were given coupons for Macy's and meals/drinks at the hotel restaurant, all of which we used. Our bellmen were great; the woman at the tour guide desk is most helpful. Were able to purchase public transit passes there and didn't have to wait in line at the bottom of Powell. Rooms small, yes, especially the bathroom, but very clean. Like having the window in the bathroom too! Quiet. Great location. Would return.

<Content>The reviews are correct! Great place and location I picked this hotel specifically from the reviews on tripadvisor. The reviewers are correct, this is a good place with a great location. The Hotel is cozy but it is clean, safe, and friendly. Don't waste money on a cab from SFO, the BART is a moderate walk away. I say moderate because it is uphill, but not as arduous as the walking that sightseeing would entail. Another tip, yes, there is a trolley stop in front of the hotel. The problem with the Trolleys is that they are usually full. Don't waste too much time waiting on them, start walking and you can jump one if it happens to have space. (we were there on a holiday weekend though). I will stay here again.

<Content>Just great! My 6 nights stay with my brother at Chancellor last May was just great: the hotel is located right on Union Square, within walking distance of all attractions. The room was very comfortable and clean, with two separate beds and a nice bathtub. The staff was very helpful, too: the check-in was at 2 pm but if you arrive too early, they can keep your luggage safe just for free!And last but not least, the price is very reasonable (71鈧?per night). So was else can we ask more? I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Our stay was too short! We spent the night prior to our cruise at the Chancellor. This is a wonderful hotel in a great location. We didn't experience any of the noise that others complained about. I actually enjoyed hearing the cable car bells as the went past the front doors. The only disappointment we had was that Sears, right next door, was closed for remodeling. When you consider what other hotels in the area charge - this is an exceptional deal. Everyone in our party is eager to plan a return trip to the Chancellor.

<Content>Shoppers dream! We had 4 nights in the Chancellor 1-5 May 2004 and found it to be a great little hotel. The staff were very friendly and the room, although small was spotless and well furnished. The location of this hotel is a shoppers dream and easy access to all the sights to be seen can be done on foot from here. Value for money it certainly was, and we would return to the Chancellor and certainly recommend it to anyone. The coffee and cookies in reception is a nice touch especially after a days sight seeing.

<Content>Great location On a hectic schedule we only stopped here for one night, but I'd recommend this hotel as being friendly, clean and with some excellent touches. For example this was the only hotel we stayed in which gave you a rubber duck for the bath! Free coffee and cookies in the lobby is a nice gesture, too.Yes, the room was small, but not too small by any means, and getting to the hotel then to the parking garage when you've never driven in San Francisco before is a bit of a baptism of fire, but not the Chancellor's fault.

<Content>excellent all round hotel I stayed at the chancellor hotel for 3 nights in march 04, We booked through trailfinders UK before travelling and paid 拢80 per night. It was excellent, the staff were extremely friendly and approachable. The rooms were spotless and cleaned well everyday. The location is perfect for sightseeing around SFO, the cable car stop is literally 2 mins walk from the front of the hotel. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in san francisco. The breakfast (not included) was also excellent.

<Content>Location, service  We spent our honeymoon at the Chancellor and these folks really made it special. We had narrowed it down to a few other choices but the Chancellor rose to the occasion and offered everything we were looking for during our week stay at an affordable price.The self-parking situation is very easy, affordable and convenient. We we impressed with our room overlooking Powell St. with cable cars running through the day. The atmosphere was exactly what you'd expect SF to be and more! 'Round the clock coffee service in the lobby was especially nice and the staff is one of the friendliest you will find anywhere.We even returned a month later for a show audition that happened to be around the corner and the location once again couldn't have been more perfect. Guess what? We got the gig and might even stay at the Chancellor again while we look for something more permanent in the city.It may not be the biggest, tallest or fanicest hotel in SF but it's by far the friendliest, most convenient and charming downtown hotel I've ever stayed. As theatre/musican performers we've travelled the world and the Chancellor is as good as they come!Bravo Maestro!

<Content>Great Place A family of four we shared two adjoining rooms for three nights and after a little mishap with the booking resevation things were back on track real soon. A great rate and an excellent hotel right in the heart of the city. The staff were probably the most friendly I have met in over 25 years of travelling USA. You were a name to them. The coffee, cookies  free newspapers were a great start for bored dad. Sweets and rubber ducks in the rooms kept the young adults entertained. The rooms were a little small but adequate with a choice of pillows and an umbrella, iron etc. If you're planning a visit to SF then you can't go wrong with the Chancellor. Highly recommneded

<Content>Location Location Location My wife and I stayed at the Chancellor for three nights in March 2004. The location of this hotel could not have been better for us, we put the hire car to bed and walked all over the city. The cable car stop was just right outside the front door (walk down to the truntable or you will never get on). The room was a little bit small but the walk in wardrobe helped with hiding the luggage. Breakfast was included in our deal and it got us of to a good start. Would I stay at the Chancellor again, yes I would.

<Content>An Amazing Getaway! Our four day trip to San Francisco was perfect, due to the excellent accomadations provided by the Chancellor Hotel. The location is perfect and the hotel itself is very well maintained. During our stay we NEVER heard anything from either of the rooms next to ours. The staff was extremely friendly, and very helpful. If your looking to get the lowdown on the local nightlife, I would strongly suggest asking the inhouse bartender. Her recommendations took us to many of the local hotspots. Perfect location, perfect service, and a perfect stay await you.

<Content>Great location Excellent location but I counted 8 homeless people who asked me for money within 4 blocks of the hotel. But hey, what do you expect from a downtown hotel with Saks across the road and Macy's across Union Square. Ours was a quiet room on the 10th floor facing Powell. The corner room we had according to the floor plan is one of the larger rooms. The rooms in the middle of them are the smallest. Coffee and cookies great. One cable car tip. If you go to catch a cable car walk a block or 2 towards Market to catch it. They call the island in the middle of the road at Powell and Post fantasy island. The cable car is always full by the time it gets there.

<Content>Great Location but reserve a room on the higher floors! We enjoyed our visit to San Francisco and the Chancellor Hotel was a great place to stay. The staff was EXCELLENT! Friendly and Helpful. The cookies and coffee are a great touch. But....beware of rooms facing Powell Street on the lower floors! The street noise is incredible! From trolley cars to trash trucks (at 5 am) we heard it all! The room was nice (a little small) but we were rarely in the room. All in all a good deal for a GREAT location. A shopaholics fantasy! A tip.... most shops will ship your goods home tax free and may even waive the shipping!

<Content>Great value city centre hotel My wife and I stayed at the Chancellor 2nd March for 3 nights as part of a longer trip to San Francisco and Lake Tahoe (for skiing). We booked the hotel on the strength of the reviews here and were not disappointed. We can endorse everything good that has been said about the hotel - it is in a great location, the rooms are clean and comfortable, there are many nice touches like the pillow menu and sweeties (candy) provided in the room. The staff are polite and very helpful.I researched the hotel scene in SF extensively and I doubt whether you can beat this hotel on what they provide for the price. OK, you could get a bigger room and more opulence elsewhere but your bank balance will suffer!Great job Chancellor, what we travellers need is more of your type of hotel - keep up the great work! We definitely intend to visit SF again and the Chancellor will be at the top of our list.

<Content>Great Value! I selected the Chancellor based on comments placed at this site and was not disappointed. Comments were right on. Small boutique hotel, great/convenient location in the heart of Union Square, reasonable rates, very friendly/helpful staff, the coffee in the lobby was a definite plus and the pillow menu was a nice and different touch. Room was a bit small but bed was comfy, Room was clean. Might feel a bit cramped if you plan to spend most of your time in the room. On another note, I'd left a favorite scarf in the hotel room and had it back within a week. I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>great value for the money I selected the hotel after reading tripadvisor comments. At the end of my one-week stay in March 2004 I was not disappointed! Took the BART from the airport for 5 $ and could walk to hotel with my baggage in 10 minutes. Right by Union Square and walking distance to Moscone Convention Center. I requested a quiet room and got one (no view, but quiet). Everybody was very helpful. The breakfast is a little expensive if you don?t have coupons or order extras: I would prefer a buffet). Good restaurants and coffee shops are close. There is no a/c but in spring that was no problem. The room was clean. I?ll come back!

<Content>Superb location, nice clean rooms A friend and I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel for 4 nights. The location was excellent - right next to Union Square where there were lots of great places to shop and tons of restaurants, and very close to most major attractions. It's a great place to stay for those who do not have cars - the cable car stop is right in front of the hotel, and the hotel is a very short walking distance to the MUNI and BART stations. The hotel is very clean and nice. The rooms were not very big, but good for 2 people. The walk-in closet was very useful - an iron and ironing board as well as an umbrella were provided (which came in handy). There was also a very small safe located in the closet. This hotel provided more hangers for your clothes than any other hotel I've ever seen. Also the large bathtub was nice although the power of the showerhead could be a lot stronger. They also provided coffee, tea, cookies and fruit in the lobby of the hotel which was great. We tried the restaurant downstairs for breakfast which was good. The front desk was very fast and efficient. We enjoyed our stay here and would go back.

<Content>Chancellor Grade: B-/C+ My family (Mom  Dad plus 2 teenage girls) stayed at the Chancellor for 7 nights in mid-February. Location was SUPER...cable car to Fisherman's Wharf/Alcatraz boats right in front of hotel--buses 2 or 3 blocks away--subway/street car about 4 or 5 blocks. Walking distance to Chinatown and SF Museum of Modern Art plus other venues (look at the map). Many beggars in the Union Square area, but they were mostly benign--we walked around until 9-10pm without feeling threatened. Large bookstore right next door.We did not rent a car for our entire stay...but we did pick up a two day rental @ the Alamo rental right around the corner. I also saw a Budget-Rent-a Car within close proximity of the hotel. Valet parking was about $35 (tax incl.)...but for one night, it was worth it. (We drove to San Jose to see the tourist trap Winchester Mystery House and to GG Bridge/Muir Woods/Mount Tam/Stinson Beach/Rt 1 --check National Geographic Scenic Drive Website for map of this 45 mile route...the scenic vistas were the best I've EVER seen.A good # of restuarants around the hotel...fabulous dim sum @ Great Eastern (Jackson St.), decent Hunan cuisine @ Hunan Henry's, Italian food at Puccini  Panetti's was good, the retro-diner up the street was barely OK. The breakfast place right next to the hotel is closed for renovation.Look into getting a SF CityPass. For $35, it included unlimited public transportation including cable cars, Alcatraz, several museums (SFMOMA and Exploratorium were excellent), and some shopping discounts (free chocolate @ Ghiradelli Sq.!)Accomodations were adequate. We had reserved a 1BR/1LR/2BATH suite, but the kids found the living room sofabed was VERY uncomfortable. I called the front desk and was informed that the hotel was sold out and to call the day manager (Rachael) in the AM. We were provided a roll-away bed and the kids camped out on the first night. The next day Rachael moved us to adjoining rooms with queen sized beds (for less money--$79/night per room plus tax). These rooms were smallish, but OK since we spent most of the days touring. Bathrooms were small, but very clean. Shower water pressure was not so great...but there were pressure balancing valves that eliminated scalding. The tubs were a little deeper than a standard tub, but no big deal. We also requested a refrigerator for the room...no charge. With windows closed and drapes drawn, the (11th floor) rooms were quiet. However, if you opened things up, you heard sirens/horns honking/etc. Furniture was a little beat up. Sheets/towels were clean. Hotel staff was excellent.Coffee/apples/cookies were always available in the lobby. The elevators are small and sometimes a little slow. We did not eat in the hotel restuarant. The very small hotel bar had a happy hour with some free food, but we never tried it.Bottom line: You absolutely can not beat the $79/night price for this excellent location. The Chancellor is NOT luxurious, but is adequate and clean.

<Content>The Chancellor isn't enchanting I was disappointed in the hotel after choosing it because of the reviews here.The location was great, right in the heart of Union Square.The service was quite good and I enjoyed picking out a special pillow from the menu.The room was quite small and quite old. I love older charming rooms but this one was just old-moldy tiles in the bathroom, the shower head was shorter than me (I am 5'5) water pressure low, etc.The biggest disappointment was the paper thin walls. I could hear every word that my neighbors were saying. Thankfully they went to bed early.The good news was that I could order a white noise machine.

<Content>Loved the Chancellor! Based upon the reviews I read on TripAdvisor, I booked a three night stay for business for the end of January/beginning of February. I loved it! I found the room to be clean and cozy. And the bathroom was just the right size for one person traveling alone. I stayed on the 11th floor towards the back and found the room to be quiet.The pillow menu was on the bed and I did try a couple of different pillows (the buckwheat was great) as well as the free passes to the Westin's gym - it as a great gym and also included spa services that you could purchase a la carte. They had a big walk-in closet to store your clothing, an iron and ironing board, and an umbrella (that I had to use a couple of times).The staff were courteous and very helpful. The hotel was conveniently located to restaurants and shops.I loved the scale of this hotel and their low-key approach to things. The cookies/coffee/tea/fruit was a nice touch. I will go back and stay there when I return to San Francisco.

<Content>Great location. This hotel is at Union Square and convenient to most everything. The rooms are small but I've found this to be true in other SF hotels - space is at a premium here and this is to be expected. The bathroom has very little counter space but what fabulous bathtubs and hey - a free rubber ducky! I stayed on the 12th floor at the back of the hotel and heard very little street noise and got good nights' sleep - not the case with other hotels in the area!!! If a good night's sleep is important to you this is the place to stay. Also nice are the parking arrangements - if driving, pull up in front of the hotle in the passenger unloading zone - it's okay to leave your car unattended if travelling alone. Then you will be directed to a parking garage that is a 2 block drive because of the 1 way streets but is really only a half block away on a perpendicular street. When I was there (Feb 2004) the parking rates were $22/day for self park and $30 for valet. There are unlimited in and out privileges with either option. The bathroom was stocked with hair dryer, conditioning shampoo (you'll still need to bring conditioner if you're used to using it), lotion, bath salts, shower cap, q-tips and cotton balls. They also have internet access on the t.v. for a $10/24 hours fee. I did not find the menu for the pillows but found out on check-out that it is in the binder. I could not find any electrical outlets except those in the bathroom. The concierge was very helpful with driving directions. I will definitely stay at this hotel again because of the quiet rooms, reasonable prices and big tub.

<Content>Excellant value, we loved the Chancellor My family had never been to San Francisco before so, we looked on Trip Advisor for help to choose our hotel, the Chancellor received excellant reviews time and time again, so we booked over the internet. The hotel was perfect for us, great service and location (cable cars stop just outside), food, clean rooms, although, bathroom could not be much smaller. Excellant shops and shopping arcades were closeby as were all forms of transport. I will most certainly stay there again and on top of that it was excellant valve for money. Thank you Trip Advisor.

<Content>Great Service, Great Price, Great Hotel This hotel was a great experience for us. We stayed in San Francisco for 5 nights. The hotel is right next to Union square and the cable cars - not a problem with noise. My fiance and I slept prefectly throughout the night. The bath tubs are huge and perfect for a relaxing bath after a long day. The front desk staff and bellmen were fantastic with directions and places to go, along with restaurant recommendations. There is free coffee and cookies, which were both delicious. This was a great hotel at an extremely affordable price when booked on expedia. I recommend this hotel to everyone!!!

Rooms a bit small but you easily get over that when you consider your location next door to Union Square. Unbelievable guest service and hospitality for a small hotel. Very polite staff willing to help with anything. Free passes to Westin St. Francis gym next door. Will highly recommend for someone looking to stay in SF for a good rate and great location. Nothing bad to say at all.

<Content>Perfect for those without cars My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights during the holiday season. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They have complimentary coffee/tea and cookies in the lobby. There is also an umbrella in the room for you to use during your stay, which was extremely useful for us. The location is nice if you don't have a car, but if you do, parking costs $20/day self-park (a short walk away) or $28 valet with ins-outs. With that and the hectic driving conditions, I would probably not recommend staying here if you have a car. Otherwise, it's a pleasant stay...a little old for my taste, but that was expected.

<Content>Wonderful European-style hotel on Union Square We stayed at the Chancellor December 26-27. We had two adjoining rooms for our party of 4 adults and 4 kids. The rooms were very clean and well equipped. Our rooms fronted on Powell Street, but the double pane windows kept almost all street noise out. The rooms are on the small side, but that is more than compensated by the wonderful location and the bargain prices.You really could not ask for a better location. It's on Powell street, just a half block up from the St. Francis and across the street from Saks. The cable car goes right by the front door.If you have a car, the self-parking at $20 with in and out privileges is a good deal. The garage is just around the corner, and the car is parked for you by attendants at the garage (the self-parking means you must drive the car to the garage--big deal!).In the lobby are complimentary coffee and tea, cookies and apples. We loved the Chancellor!

<Content>Wonderful and a bargain This place is a gem. Located on Union Square, a short walk from the Bay Area Trains (BART), which can take you directly to the airport for under $5, and with the touristic cable cars and a line of cabs just outside, you get clean, comfortable, good-sized rooms, walk-in cupboards, friendly and helpful staff and lots of other goodies. They gave us all a free breakfast on Christmas Day and there are cookies and various types of coffee and tea in the foyer all day. They really do match any price you find on the internet, so do a price-check here and call them - you won't be disappointed! The only negative experience I had was in hearing the neighbours too well - the walls seem to be quite thin. But the rest made up for this, and it didn't stop us from sleeping.

<Content>Tips for enjoying the Chancellor I should have written this ages ago, but . . . we stayed at the Chancellor Hotel twice last year, and would definitely stay there again in the future. Wonderful service--the best of any hotel I can recall--as well as a great location and economical price. A few tips: 1) It may be my imagination, but the rooms facing Powell Street seem a bit larger than those on the inside. And we didn't find them noisier, in spite of being over a busy street. 2) If you like to things on the spur of the moment, use the self-park option--the garage is very close--rather than valet parking: the valets have to park quite a distance away, and when traffic was heavy, they weren't able to get our car back to us immediately (I think they ask for 20 minutes' notice). 3) Pull/push your door shut completely, to make sure it latches (a good idea at any hotel). 4)Take advantage of the bathtub! 5) When strawberries are in season, go next door to Sear's Fine Foods for strawberry waffles.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! This hotel was friendly and courteous! We checked in later then 3pm--got caught up shopping, first visit to San Fran--so the hotel called us to make sure we were still coming. Of course we were!! We arrived to check in, excellent location easy to find! Very welcoming staff. For July 4th, great rate included parking. The room was small with 2 twins, which I was aware when booking. Our room was along Powell Street a bit noisy, for the light sleeper. I am not, so no issue for me, plus it was 4th of July! But they did have a menu for pillows to select from! The motto is correct: the cable car literally stops at the door!! It was great!! When I return again to San Fran, I will be visiting the Chancellor.

<Content>Excellent Value for the Money My first trip to San Fran with my husband...he chose the Chancellor and made an excellent choice. It has a location to die for...fantastic shopping, dining, attractions, just a short walk or catch the trolley right near the hotel entrance. Delicious homebaked cookies in the lobby, firm matteress, a large walk-in closet, and friendly helpful staff are a few outstanding features. Housekeeping found my 18K gold topaz pendant on the floor by my bed and left it on the TV for me! If you work out in the mornings, ask the front desk for your fee pass to the gym located at the Westin just down the street. Excellent value for the money.

<Content>Perfect - if you don't have kids! I go to San Francisco often and this is my favorite place to stay. The combination of price, location and quality is hard to beat in the city. The rooms are clean and has what looks like new double-pane windows to protect its occupants from those noisy and cool nights. Its located in the heart of Union Square, the cable car stops right in front of the hotel to take you to Fisherman's Wharf, and Chinatown is less than 5-minute walk. This is not a well-known hotel, but they deserve to be! Love the complementary coffee, tea, apples, and fresh baked cookies in the lobby. Highly recommended! The only thing missing are rooms with two double beds for families!

<Content>Convenient hotel I stayed here on a couple of weeks ago and opted for the parking package. It was an extremely wise move considering the parking charges nearby. The parking lot was about 200 yards (turn left from the hotel and then right onto Sutter Street by walking but for the car, it's left from Powell onto Post, first left again onto Stockton, first left onto Sutter and then on the right!) and it was great to drop the car and pick it up. The hotel was comfortable and despite facing Powell Street, did not hear too much noise. It is superbly located for Union Square and Market Street. Food-wise, there is a breakfast cafe next door called Sears Fine Foods which is opened from 7am-3pm but I think it is closed on Monday and Tuesday. Lori's Diner (one block from the left on Sutter/Powell, another branch is on Powell Street) is a 50s style diner, serving burgers, etc.Scala's Bistro is immediately opposite and serves Californian-Italian cuisine. You may to book on Friday and Saturday.Because of the location, you are no more than 10 minutes walk from the shops though take advantage of the tram to reach Fisherman's Wharf.
