<Content>Never again, terrible For the price I really expected so much more (I stayed in one of their suites).Their photos on line looked way nicer then the actual room. The walls where PAPER thin. I could hear the person in the next room taking a bath (at 6am) and the sound was amplified and echoed through my room.I payed the extra 10 bucks for their business package. I was still charged for parking (they took it off eventually, but I had to ask them twice). Even though my checkout time was 4pm (part of their business package) the maid service knocked on my door 3 times! (I should mention, I had a do not disturb sticker on my door) Then, the maid service actually called my room to find out what time I was leaving. I have NEVER had that happen before, late check out or not.Lastly, I was locked out of the elevator twice and had to go to the front desk to get back in to my room.I will never stay there again.

<Content>My new Seattle Hotel! After a surprisingly low rate from Priceline, I was skeptical, but the deal was sealed and the price too low to say no to. I live just outside the city, but I stay in the city about once a month, and will probably stay here 90% of the time from now on. The outside is nothing to write home about, but enter the lobby and you're in a lovely boutique hotel. I just don't have anything bad to say, from the amazingly kind and attentive staff to the cool decor, to the view. FREE PARKING is the cherry on top. I am sick of $35 a night piracy at the big downtown hotels.

<Content>A Definite YES! Recently renovated, the Deca is a wonderful place to stay, especially if visiting a son/daughter going to the University of Washington or overnite when enjoying a Husky game (the stadium is within walking distance). The color scheme throughout is upbeat, modern and inviting. The elevator walls are plush navy velvet and the hallway wallpaper and carpeting are extremely appealing. The rooms are very comfortable as well as the beds and pillows. We stayed on the 15th floor with a gorgeous view of downtown Seattle and the Space Needle. Also, they offer 2 free-of-charge computers in the lobby and free Wi-Fi if you bring your own. Remember, if you have a UW alumni assoc. card, ask for your Dawg discount. We saved $29 and parking was free. FYI-just north of the hotel on Saturdays is the local Farmers Market at Brooklyn  50th.

<Content>a fine stay Perfectly nice hotel in the U District, very convenient to downtown as well. It was clean and safe. Nicely designed, not too swanky and not too motel-ly looking. WiFi was pretty weak but I bring my own anyway, so it didn't matter. The room was a bit chilly, but I turned the heat on and it was fine. The staff were nice and helpful. I hadn't thought to ask that the bed have a blanket on it--seems kinda standard, right-- but when i asked for a blanket that wasn't made of down, they didn't have any, so they gave me a pile of sheets. the bed was quite comfortable and I slept like a log.No more free breakfast, but there's a Tully's Coffee in the hotel where you can get a coffee that's probably better than what their free coffee would be. Tons of places to eat nearby-- you're in the best part of Seattle for ethnic cheap eats.

<Content>Excellent facility, awesome prices Well I read earlier comments which may have been during or before rehab. The facility is dated on the outside. They offer different packages including free parking and even gas card. I negotiated a significant discount off the rack rate by talking to them direct. Also got free parking and a $100 gas card for a 3 night stay. The interior is exactly like pictured on the website. Staff friendly and helpful. Size of room is a subjective thing. We had two queen bed, a sitting area with two upholstered chairs and a table, a desk and chair and the plasma screen sat on a long wooden piece of furniture. I certainly felt the room was large. The decor of the room was exactly like the pictures of the rooms on the website.I will certainly be a return guest due to all mentioned above as well as it's proximity to downtown Seattle, ease of getting there and very reasonable rates.

<Content>I wish we would've stay longer! Beautiful hotel! We were staying on the 14th floor (we were so happy to receive a free upgrade to a higher floor!) and could see entire Seattle downtown and surrounding mountains. Great view! Very nice staff. Individual who checked us in was very helpful. Provided us with a speedy check in and great service. The room was rather small, but very cozy and clean. The bellmen were wonderful, always friendly and helpful. Good size TV, enough channels. Unfortunately, we didn鈥檛 get chance to try their breakfast. Would鈥檝e been nice to have a bigger closet in the room. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in Seattle. Excellent location for visiting UW. I wish they wouldn鈥檛 charge for parking, but on the other hand I don鈥檛 know any other full service hotel that would offer a free parking nowadays.

<Content>Fun Hotel in Seattle My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Deca for three days in September. It is a very neat Hotel with great beds, nice employees and an overall good vibe. We utilized the free shuttle and went to Pike's Market and other downtown locations. This saved a ton of money on cab fare but please remember to schedule the shuttle early and tip the driver. Find a different place to have breakfast (like Costas) two blocks away but do have a cocktail at the District Lounge!

<Content>No issues with Hotel Deca... I must say I was a bit apprehensive after reading the posts here, but I can happily report our recent stay at Hotel Deca was very good.We are a family of 4, with one 3 yr old toddler and a 6 week old newborn. The hotel room was large enough for us, although the bathroom was tight.The room was clean and the hotel staff were great, contrary to some posts reported here. I know experiences can vary from person to person, but I have no issues with this hotel. $6 parking at the hotel was a good deal as well. This hotel is well-located within minutes of downtown and the Woodland Park Zoo (our primary destination).Our PL bargain at $60 a night also helped.

<Content>Overpriced, tiny, dirty room The suite was smaller than most normal hotel rooms, it was over $300 a night, the staff was rude, there was hair and gunk in the shower, plus empty cheap liquor bottles in the closet. I will never stay here again.We arrived at the hotel around 2 pm. The front desk wouldn't let us check in, since check in time started at 3. It was a sunny day, so we cheerfully left  went to walk around the U of W campus next door. When we returned a couple hours later, we were given a room on the 4th floor. It was the Junior Suite we were supposed to have, but we had been promised (and paid for) a room on an upper floor (those are the ones with a view). Our room looked out on a parking lot, and we had no view of the water or the city. I went back to the front desk, and they told me all the good suites had been given out earlier - we checked in too late to get one. I tried to explain that we had tried to check in earlier, but were turned away. But the hotel was full, and the clerk was unyielding  snotty.The room was very cramped and small for a suite. There was no bureau, unless you count the 20 tall plastic bin with drawers in the closet. Also in the closet - two empty four-packs of cheap wine coolers. The bathtub had long dark hairs in it (we have short light hair), plus a patch of slimy moldy stuff. The acoustics of the bathroom vents are such that you can clearly hear other people in the bathrooms above/below you. Presumably, they can hear you too 鈥?all sounds are transmitted  shared. And I mean all.The continental breakfast was inattentively served. Very slow to refill coffee cups, lots of fingerprints on the plates  silverware, had to ask repeatedly for things like coffee cream. We got to enjoy hearing the servers insult one another  fight over tips  complain about management. The food was OK, but the ambiance  poor service ruined it.The sofa bed in our room hadn鈥檛 been made up (although we had requested it in advance), and when I called housekeeping they acted like I was making an unreasonable request. Someone finally came threw some sheets on the bed. But no blankets or pillows 鈥?that took another call, and another long wait.We never got more than the initial, single bar of soap. We had to again call  ask for a new bar. How hard it is to put a new bar of soap in the room when you clean it?Beware the rooms by the ice machines/elevators 鈥?both cause a lot of noise.The lobby is indeed very pretty, parking is convenient, and the U of W is a stone鈥檚 throw away. But I would rather sleep in the gutter with the raving homeless people than stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Not perfect, but pretty darn good Just left Seattle and wanted to give Deca a plug for being so nice to our family. There were a few little things that could improve, but the service was top notch.Pros:1) Friendly, accomodating staff. Service with a smile  a sincere desire to please.2) Lobby is a great place to gather to plan your day. In some hotels you feel really self-concious sitting in the lobby, but here you feel completely at ease.3)The free shuttle made it really easy to get downtown. The first day we took the car downtown and had to pay $18 to park - this was a great alternative.4) Spacious room. We were in 1507 which had two queen beds and still enough room for 3 chairs, a desk, and a tv stand. It was comfortable for our family of 4.5) Views, views, views! Nice view of downtown, the Space Needle, and the mountains. This was a big hit with the kids.6) Price. The hotel was about $40 lower than the same level of hotels we considered downtown. We used the money we saved to go on a seaplane ride - a better investment if you have kids!Cons:1) Bathroom is small. If i was traveling by myself i wouldn't mind, but with a family it took a lot of time to get everyone ready.2) The room has a DVD player but they don't have any DVD's to loan you. They should have a library if they are going to have a player,3) They don't have a kids menu. All in all the restaurant didn't cater to kids very well. We didn't see many other kids during our stay, but still...4) could be more green. There was an option to not change your sheets, but no recyle bins, the tempature control was old and only turned on and off which keeps the AC running even when you aren't there,  the fireplace in the lobby is on all the time burning gas.All in all we would stay again. The nice staff, beautiful decor,  good value made up for the cons'.

<Content>Fantastic stay at Deca great experience for our first trip to Seattle, along with our children aged 11 and 6. Incredibly helpful young staff (most are students trying to earn money). Free courtesy car to the zoo, downtown and a shopping mall. Great tips of where to eat and shops to visit, provided by the staff. Our room suffered a burst pipe after two nights stay and we were immediately upgraded to a bigger room with lots of apologies. Great places to eat nearby and although out of town we liked that feeling of staying in a real neighbourhood. Very good value for money and frankly we don't go to hotels to spend all day there, we want to spend it out in the city. Ideally a hotel should provide a clean and comfy place to stay, where the staff are helpful and the location suits your needs and the price suits your budget. We really enjoyed our stay here.

The location is quite good if you decide to stay in the university district, otherwise its a bit far from life.The staff (front desk) ist quite a joke.I felt like jumping into a teenage pyjama party.Desorganised, giggeling, tumb and unfriendly girls.I do not recommend anybody to stay there.I am in Seattle quite often: It was my first an last stay.

<Content>Don't be fooled I booked based on the rave reviews on the site, and was sorely disappointed. We were in Seattle for graduation weekend, and the hotel conveniently jacked its rates way up. This was in no way good value for money. The hotel is 2-star at best. Whoever says it is 5-star based on their world travels must be kidding. The place is shabby, the rooms are small, the bathrooms are at least 20 years old, and it feels like a bad Hampton Inn, remodeled out of a fake boutique hotel catalogue. This is not a pleasant, boutique hotel. It is a run-down pit taking advantage of people who are looking for a boutique experience.

<Content>Mediocre experience at the Deca Totally a mediocre, 2 star place. I'm surprised by many of the reviews here. Got a deal on the Deca, and looked up ratings online. Most places rate this 4 to 4.5 stars. Deca is an old hotel that's been remodeled. We ended up seeing 2 rooms, the first being close to the elevator with water damage on the ceiling. The bed in that room was very hard. We moved to another room. Wallpaper was peeling in some spots. Water damage on the ceiling here. The worst? The bathtub did not drain and we stood calf high in water while we showered. I think some people get dazzled by the new and hip decorations of the lobby, multiple pillows on the bed and the flat screen TV in the room. Honestly, this is a 2 or 3 star experience at best. If you want to stay some place nice, try Inn at the Market, the Sheraton or one of the Kimpton group hotels.

<Content>Elegant, Clever Accommodations Convenient to U District and Downtown Seattle My colleague told me that staying at the Hotel Deca would be a treat, but I was not prepared for what I encountered. I fell in love with the boutique concept of intimate, unique accommodations while traveling frequently for business to San Francisco a few years ago. I did not expect to find anything remotely similar in Seattle, but the Hotel Deca proved me wrong. The clever Art Deco meets Michael Graves style lobby was both stunning and cozy and our beautifully appointed room followed suit. Unlike many other boutique hotels I have frequented, the meticulously styled room was quite large and the king-sized bed was a delight. Throughout our stay, the staff was professional, friendly and, I might add, as elegant as the property itself. The hotel鈥檚 U District location proved to be perfect for my business needs at the University of Washington while my wife had quick and easy access to Seattle鈥檚 downtown and Lake Union tourist destinations. We both decided that the next time Seattle is in our itinerary for whatever reason, we will be staying at the Deca.

<Content>Worst room condition/dirty rooms and baths Still in the hotel, only because booked two nights prepaid. While the front desk and bell service are good, housekeeping is extremely bad. The bathroom is dirty with hairs left on walls, nobody really cleaned bathroom before and during my stay. The carpet in the room was not clean and wasn't cleaned/vacuumed during our stay (same bread crumbles stayed untouched). Towels look to be used for ages having some yellowish stains. The bathroom feels and smells rather like a public restroom rather than luxury hotel bathroom! General feeling was that the room was not cleaned for us when we came in, but rather got 5-minute touch-up to look OK. All amenities and gadgets that they put in the room don't make it looking bad, but rather odd. Couple years ago we stayed in a small 30-buck motel in Southern California - that one was really clean comparing to this dirty monster. Really - my WORST hotel experience in many years.

<Content>It's an OK hotel to be close to the UW We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in April for my husband's depense. Overall I am not impressed with the hotel with the money we spent. There is no discount, so we paid the normal rate. The hotel service is not the best we have seen. Also the bathroom is paper thin. I can hear every noise from the bathroom above me. Trust me it's not a pleasant experience. What does impress me is the HDTV entertainment center and also the IPOD docking station. The hotel itself is definitely well decorated and has some great amenities, but the problem is it's quite old, and there is just so much you can remodel....Oh if you do decide to stay, I highly recommand you to try the awesome restaurants in the U district. There is a great Thai vegetarian buffet right across 45th from the hotel.

<Content>Great find While I've stayed in many sub par hotels that have had a retrofit, and re branded themselves a boutique hotel, the Deca certainly delivers on the promise at a excellent rate to boot. The real selling point for us was the proximity to many of the smaller surrounding neighbourhoods. The service was prompt, the hotel spotless, and the rooms while fitting of the boutique designation were still comfortable (which I've found is frequently lost in the translation). Now this is certainly not in the same category as our home grown Le Germain hotel, for the price it's a steal. Definitely recommended.

<Content>Hip hotel Had a pleasant stay at the Hotel Deca in Seattle. Good for business travel-- comfortable chair with desk, helpful staff that was knowledgeable about the Seattle area. I was there for a conference.Had a nice room on one of the top floors in the corner of the building. There are good views available like this one, so I recommend asking about it. There is a downstairs bar/restaurant. Small TVs, though. So if, for example, you are trying to watch the Red Sox in game 2 of the World Series, you should go somewhere else. :-) Swanky lobby with a fireplace (can't remember if real fire) is a good place to lounge around and meet up with a friend. In the University district. Plenty of good food nearby. I would stay here again.

<Content>Nice Surprise For the rate this was a great value. We were visiting family for Thanksgiving in Seattle and we picked it because the location was convenient to my family's house. We were surprised when we checked in to find a very chic lobby, large rooms that have been recently renovated. It very much had a feel of a chic boutique hotel. The free continental breakfast was more like the Hampton Inn - but it was free. Also it was in a convenient location with lots of reasonably priced restaurants as a result of being near a university and easy freeway (I-5) access to the rest of Seattle.

<Content>Small but nice and clean After reading all the reviews (the good ones and the bad), we decided to stay at the hotel because it's relatively cheap for a 3 stars hotel (around $100 per night on Priceline). Yes, the room is quite small but it is very clean and has all the amenties (big LCD TV, alarm clock radio where you can plug in your iPod, Dvd, comfy bed). The style of the hotel is elegant and I find quite tasteful. While it is not in the heart of Seattle, they do provide a free drop off/pickup shuttle service (which ends at 10PM at night) to the Westin in Downtown. The free breakfast I find was pretty good... bagels, fruit, yogurt, bread, cereal, tea/coffee, etc. I would definitely stay again!

<Content>Interesting renovation, improve room service! This is a nice re-make of a dowdy old building, although even cosmetics couldn't change the thin walls, teeny bathroom, and oddly-shaped room in which I had to lie perpendicular on the bed to watch TV and practically had to lean out the window to see myself in the full-size mirror. Still, a great bed, nice amenities, good sheets. Excellent service at the front desk and speedy room service....but that's where they lost me. I ordered a steak and salad and expected a basic tray at the door. What arrived instead (although in record time) was a plastic bag with cardboard takeout boxes and plastic cutlery. It's not easy to cut a nearly raw piece of meat inside a paper box with plastic cutlery. Considering the $42 I paid for that meal it was pretty sady, actually.

It has always been my first choice when I travel to Seattle for my official trip. Helpful staff, free wifi, have one of the most coolest lobby i seen in the northeast. They even have a fire place in the lobby. The rooms are comfortable, clean and most important safe. What else you want for a hotel.... Maybe the only improvement that they need to inprove is the breakfast. Should cater more varity to suit different taste.

<Content>Best in the area I have stayed several times in the University of Washington area. The other hotels (Silver Cloud, University) are not much, and only a little less $$ than the Deca. The Deca has some class. Clearly this is an old building that has been refurbished, and at least on my floor and in my room, this refurbishment was done well. I think that if I go again I'll stay in Bellevue and drive, rather than going for the local option. But if you want to be within walking distance to the campus, I'll recommend the Deca.

<Content>Unfortunate experience?? Was recommended by a hotelier to stay at the Deca but our experience was not what it should have been. We booked (family of 4) directly with the hotel in Feb 2007 for 3 nights in August. I called in July 2007 to make sure the booking was still good. They had no booking. Re-booked. Before our departure I noticed that my bank account was down two night stay for some dates in July. I called the hotel and discovered they had accidentally charged my credit card for someboby elses stay!! All was refunded - even the currency difference after we complained. Hotel rooms and lobby are lovely. The walk to the breakfast room is just shabby. More could be done to improve the breakfast. The lifts are a very, very, very slow - mostly occupied by the chambermaids. Other guests also agreed.Front desk staff have no knowledge of the area (restaurants etc.) and admitted so.Have to say I would not stay here again.

<Content>Nice facility but the staff is... ... incompetent at best. The rooms are fine (nicely decorated and very clean -- housekeeping does a great job. Comfy bed and pillows too) although the wireless is pretty flakey (and don't bother to ask the staff for assistance -- they either don't have a clue or just don't care).The BIG problem with this hotel is the incompetence of the staff. I do give them props for being insanely cheerful (to the point of being annoying) while they tell you it really isn't their problem, it is your (the guest) fault and to have a good one! Ack. Granted, the average age of the front desk staff appears to be about 23 (and they all have great gum-chewing skills!), so perhaps things will improve as they mature a bit. But until then, I am staying at the new, lovely hotel a few block away. If you do stay here, make sure you get EVERYTHING in writing before you check in. And just beware that customer service is no where on their list of priorities. (In a way, I guess it IS my fault because I had expected to be treated with honesty, courtesy and respect -- silly me! :)

<Content>Unparalelled Value! We decided on a sightseeing/shopping trip and left it to the last minute. Chose The Deca because of the preponderance of good reviews here. We drove down from Vancouver, B.C. and showed up hours early. They dealt with an internet access issue for us on the spot and offered the hotel shuttle to get us downtown to start our day. These people were fantastic. The bellmen/expediters, Joe and Javier, were unfailingly gracious as were the front desk staff. The room was clean, spacious ( we have two kids) and very well appointed. The beds and pillows were the equal of accomodations in more sophisticated joints. There is a very well stocked breakfast buffet (cold) and the little bar downstairs has great atmosphere and staff too. It's all about attitude and Hotel Deca has an attitude that ensures our next stay in Seattle will be with them.

<Content>Rude Front Desk Front Desk were all young woman I guessed they worked here part time and were college students. When checking in I felt like I was imposing and they were doing me a favor. After the cold reception I went to my room and though nicely decorated and clean was too small I couldn't walk around the bed without tripping. Don't stay here I would go as far as paying less for a 2 star than stay here again.

<Content>Nicely refurbished The art deco overhaul of this hotel was nicely done. The outside of the building is still quite blah (but they are apparently working on this) but the interior is complete. Booked the room on Priceline for $79, and received a well-decorated though small corner room with a bizarrely large closet. Rooms come equipped with flat screen TVs, and iPod clock radios (bring your own iPod). Everything was clean and tidy overall. The hotel throws in free parking with your room, so considering the usual hotel parking rates of $20 or more, it's an excellent throw-in. They also include a complimentary continental breakfast served in large room near the lounge. Good basic fixings - hot and cold cereal, toast, bagels, danishes, apples, bananas, coffee, tea. The one drawback may be the university district neighbourhood. There is almost no street life around the hotel, not much in way of shops or restaurants. There's a Tully's in the lobby that closes by 6 pm, a Safeway a few blocks away that's open late, and a movie theatre. But the area is quiet at night, not neccessarily in a good way. There was some police activity one night, and in general, the area doesn't have a great reputation in the city.

<Content>Wonderful Staff Our son just graduated from the University of Washington and we needed a place to put our out of town guests coming to his commencement. We chose this hotel because it is so close to UW, but also is just a few minutes to all the downtown tourist attractions. It was the absolutely perfect choice! The hotel is gorgeous with a large lobby where family members can gather before heading out for the day, and the staff were amazing! Everyone we encountered was so friendly and helpful. My 75 year old parents need a lot of help getting around these days and everyone went out of their way to make sure they were comfortable. One of them even walked with my Dad to the local grocery store a few blocks away because he insisted on walking instead of taking the hotel's shuttle van, because they were worried that he wouldn't be able to carry the bags back by himself! Our family had a total of five rooms, and everyone of them has called me to thank me for choosing Hotel Deca - it will always be our first choice for our out fo town guests from now on.

<Content>Superficially Nice, while Actually Quite Poor The place felt like a cheap one star hotel masquerading as a nicer hotel with its superficially chic, but cheap-on-closer inspection-art-deco furniture.I am a middle-aged professional that travels for business at least once a month. Hotel Deca looked like the appropriate place to stay, given its proximity to the University of Washington.I have probably stayed in over 100 hotels in the past 20 years. I have never met a staff so ignorant.My first question regarded gym facilities at the hotel. The staff person asked another: do we have a gym here? Each time I inquired about gym facilities, I received a different answer.I was constantly faced with inaccurate answers to my questions. I was incorrectly told that there were no laundry services. When I asked about restaurants nearby, I was told to: just walk down the street (it was night). When the wireless stopped working, I was told to: just purchase a cable from the front desk. I noted that perhaps some of the other guests would like to use the wireless service.The staff were well-meaning and friendly, but completely ill-prepared to perform their jobs, and unfamiliar with the norms for a hotel.On my second night I received no wash cloths, shampoo or conditioner. This problem was corrected by the night staff.The room was small, and there are no drawers for clothing, except for a small plastic one at the bottom of the closet.I emailed the manager of this hotel, but received no reply. Generally, unresponsive.

<Content>Let Down! Looking at the hotel pictures and wonderful reviews I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. We booked with hotwire and on arrival the receptionist could not find our reservations nor was a room ready. We were told with a sickeningly fake smile to kindly move away from the desk and she would call us when a room was ready. Three hours later no call we went back and were able to get a room. I asked the same receptionist if we should reserve the free shuttle for later on that afternoon into the city she said no just call half an hour before. I called at 4PM and was told it was all booked up until 7.30... couldn't believe it. We ended up paying for a cab downtown there and back. The bedroom was so small there wasn't room to swing a dead cat. The bed was a full size and was only just big enough for the two of us and we are slim. The bathroom was miniscule and it was difficult to close the bathroom door due to the small size and toilet being in the way. Was very claustrophbic and we were happy to leave after two days. Outside of the hotel is run down it didnt look safe and there are lots of transients walking around. My husband said he saw a homeless person buying drugs from a cab driver right outside of the hotel. The only decent thing was the free breakfast. Oh and the coffee shop closes early and is closed on Sundays. Not worth the money stay somewhere else.

<Content>Great location We stayed at the Hotel Deca over the long weekend for three nights. The rooms are decorated beautifully and were very spacious. I would recommend a room that is high due to street noise. The bathroom was small and did not have a lock or a fan. This may not bother others but it was an issue for me. We did not find noise to be a problem. The best thing about this hotel is the location. We walked to a fantastic Italian restaurant and lots of really cool shops. There are all kinds of things to do within walking distance. This is a college area so it is quite colorful and I don't know if people with small children would like it. We have teenagers and they loved the area. All in all it was a good value for the money and we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Very Nice This hotel is near the Univ of Washington; but only a short drive to downtown. Free parking next to the hotel is a real plus. The young, but helpful staff were eager to please. The Bar/ Rest. in the basement (The District) did not have a broad menu; but the entrees they prepared were done well. I thought I would be put-off by the Art-Deco theme of the hotel, but it was not too obtrusive and I quickly got used to it. I like to walk for exercise and the area offered many options for walkers (or joggers for that matter). The hotel seemed to have mostly business types while I was there, but it would work well for families as well. The bed and bedding were first class. Would recommend the property. PGowdy

<Content>Overall great - but SMALL room First the good news. We felt the location was great. My wife ran in the morning on the U Wash campus and it's beautiful. The library reading room there is amazing -- rivals NYC's public library. Lots of small restaurants nearby (NEVER have seen so many Asian type places in such close proximity -- e.g. literally two Vietnamese cafes a door apart). Trip into the city is easy and hotel has a free shuttle which we used one day. Very friendly and helpful staff. Free and easy parking, which is great. The art deco look is a little odd and strained at points, but I warmed up to it. The only bad news really is that our room, by the outside stairs, was itty bitty. Pay a little more for a larger room. It had one office-type chair, no light by the bed (in fact the only light was a lamp on the desk, so impossible to read in bed unless you move the lamp, which we did). Bathroom is so small that you can barely stand in it and close the door. But it was QUIET, which is a must for me and worth a lot. For the money, all in all, I can't complain too much.

<Content>Good Value, Good location Stayed at Hotel Deca from April 27th to April 29th. Overall the hotel was well worth the money and I believe a better choice than other similarly priced hotels in Seattle.Hotel is in the University District which is a fun neighborhood filled with ethnic restaurants and bars. Felt very safe in the neighborhood even when out after midnight as there were always plenty of UW students wandering around.Hotel lived up to its Art Deco motif and we found the room comfortable and unique compared to the standard hotel. Yes bathroom is a little small with limited shelf space but shower pressure is good which is all I really care about in a hotel bathroom. Rooms also come equipped with an ipod dock alarm clock which was useful as well as flat screen tvs with DVD player.The University neighborhood can get gridlocked with traffic and we had the misfortune of being there on a weekend where the road outside was being repaved but the noise was minimal. Even with the traffic we did find it a convenient location for setting out by car to sight see in other parts of the city.We also visited the District Lounge Bar in the basement of the hotel which was a fun choice as well with an interesting assortment of cocktail specials and a good happy hour with live music. The only drawback was that they stop serving food early.We never did wake up in time for the continental breakfast but again there are plenty of small cheap places in the neighborhood to eat.Overall a great choice for staying in Seattle.

<Content>Below Expectations My house had a power outage so I decided to spend a night at Hotel Deca. I stayed in one of their Deluxe Rooms, but in no way was it deluxe. Maybe my expectations were too high, I was expecting more than a shoebox of a room and was surprised not to find a refrigerator or microwave! The room also lacked a safe which would have been nice. And the worst part for me was the tiny tiny bathroom. There was little space to set toiletries. The breakfast was bland, cold continental items and coffee. The breakfast was included as was wireless internet access, a plus! I would recommend this hotel if you are just looking for a place to sleep. If you are looking for something special or a hotel with extras, I do not recommend Hotel Deca.

<Content>Hotel Deca - Great! Great Hotel! I read the other TA reviews on this hotel prior to selection and offer a few updates. But first my thoughts.Staff was very friendly and outgoing always asking if we needed anything and offering a smile with their Enjoy your day.Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and the decor outstanding (okay, we are into the retro look and the Hotel Deca - rators did a great job). The lobby and seating areas were in the same style and just add to the classiness of building!There were concerns by others about the WiFi, but we had a signal strength of four bars (out of five) on the north side sixth floor. The rooms are a little smaller than average, but having said that, this is a 50's/60's building and as such the rooms were generally smaller in that era. Our feeling was that there was plenty of room for relaxing, sleeping and just hanging out.This hotel is not in the business district of Seattle. It is located in the University District which has its own character. A little funky with lots of ethnic restaurants, and we had a blast.

<Content>Completely renovated, stylish, and clean! After a very bad experience with another hotel in the Seattle area, we called around to various hotels and found Hotel Deca. Their rates were very competitive with other hotels in Seattle, and they were conveniently located just outside of the downtown area. One of the key factors was that Hotel Deca offerred free parking for our selected room type. Otherwise, parking in the downtown area would have added to the daily rate of other hotels.When we checked in, we found that the recently renovated hotel was very stylishly decorated and clean. The staff at the front desk was very professional and helpful. Free WiFi Internet access is availablethroughout the hotel, and I was able to get a good signal from my room. Bed linens, towels, carpet, and bathroom all were clean. Even the shampoo and soap had a pleasing uniqueness to them. The hotel room featured a large (approx 32) LCD TV with DVD player. The alarm clock was an iHome that had an iPod dock, which was a nice feature. The continental breakfast in the lounge was convenient for us to grab somethinig quick to eat in the morning. Though you are in the middle of a college town, it is a very quick drive to downtown Seattle (6-8 minutes) depending on traffic. There are the usual college type restaurants in the neighborhood and a rather good vegeterian restaurant called Aruya a block away. If you want to experience unique Seattle restaurants, then you'll probably want to venture downtown to Flying Fish or Wild Ginger. There are a couple comedy clubs in the hotel neighborhood if you are looking for some nighttime entertainment. We visited the Giggles comedy club, which was fairly priced at $12 with a one drink minimum (but we were also given complimentary passes to come back and see another show on another date). Overall, I would probably look here first if I were visiting Seattle again. The price is fair and the accommodations are great.

<Content>attentive staff, no odors, clean, fun decor, water temp is highly variable Stayed there on university business. Found on internet and booked by UWA. Huge improvement over the last time I stayed there a number of years ago (updated).Excellent hotel and very attentive staff. The most attentive staff of any full service business hotel I have stayed at in the last year. They were at my door in 5 minutes when I asked for something at 11:30pm.  Convenient and free parking. No odor in room, which was excellent. Not even perfume air freshener. This was one of the high points. Too many feathers, had to request some special pillows and blankets to have a feather-free bed, but they came in about 5 minutes. Had a room on the 15th floor with view of the space needle. Excellent and quiet room. Recently updated. Shower has highly fluctuating temperature. You have to be prepared to jump out of shower periodically as it gets very hot or cold all of a sudden. Comfortable beds.Excellent value for U district. Would stay there again.

<Content>This is a shocker We had booked to stay for several nights at the end of our holiday.Arriving to find most of reception being renovated, and far from the luxury room that we had booked, the linen was not clean, the bathroom was a mess, and there were stains on the ceiling - this was a room in need of a makeover.Breakfast was a small offering, served on plastic plates with stale rolls. Not a pleasure.The neighborhood is also suspect after dark - we did not venture out, but there didn't appear to be anything in the way of decent food in the area.We checked out after one night and moved downtown, pleased to have escaped.The only excuse to stay here is if you are visiting relatives studying at UW - apart from that forget it, you will not enjoy the experience

<Content>Lots of positives, a few negatives My wife and I stayed at the UT for five days while visiting our daughter. For the most part, the stay was very pleasant. The hotel was clean, well decorated and, most important, quiet for a large city. The rooms were a little on the small side and if I were to return, I would pay extra for a larger room. The location is excellent for anything in and around the University. It is a relatively easy walk to almost everything or, given the size of UW, as close to walking distance as you're likely to get.The negatives-wireless internet service was sporadic and very frustrating. Any connection you were able to make was precarious at best. Direct connection to the wall data port didn't work at all. We were told reception varies from room to room. More important, we were told that they were in the process of rewiring. If internet/email is important, you should inquire on the status before making a reservation.The second negative is probably more of a perception issue for us small town folks. The neighborhood right around the hotel appears to be a little suspect. The daytime was no problem but, at night, when we ventured out to enjoy the local neighborhood (lots of independent movie theaters, interesting bars and dining choices), I was a little nervous. Nothing happened and I am probably a little too cautious. Regardless, the hotel has a parking area that is well lit and appeared to be secure via video monitors and attendants.By the way, there is a lounge in the basement that has different ownership. (There is no room service.) We had dinner there one night and were pleasantly surprised. It doesn't look like much and it seemed to be having some growing pains, but the food was very good and fairly priced.All in all, I would recommend this hotel and will stay there again, assuming they have solved the internet issues.

<Content>Loved It! The hotel isn't that quite appeasing from the outside. But, the inside doesn't compare to the outside. The hotels interior is of creative sound like no other. It has a fireplace in the lobby with lots of lounge chairs and the rooms, elevators has this gothic theme to it, which was really cool. Our room had the view of WU. It had a ref. and a micro. which was really nice because most hotels don't provide. Although, we didn't read the daily paper, it came in before we even woke up. Aside from the complimentary breakfast and parking, they also had complimentary internet access in the lobby to check your email or print out your flight confirmation or anything. I think for the price we paid was still. This hotel is the by far the best hotel we've stayed at in Seattle.

<Content>If only they had better linens We just returned from a two-night stay at the University Tower hotel. We were dropping our daughter off to UW, so the location was perfect. It was within walking distance to everything related to the university. For the price we paid, it was very comparable to other like hotels. The price also included free parking and a continental breakfast. The breakfast was mainly breads, cereals, some fruits, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, juices, coffee, etc. Just the basics, but presented in a very nice room that had both small tables and sofa areas. Attached to the lobby is a Tullys coffee shop. In the lobby are two computers that you can use to get on the internet for free. You can print five pages for free and additional pages for fifteen cents each. They were a bit slow, but, hey... it was free. Overall, the service was very very good. The front desk workers were all nice and competent. Even the people in Tullys were very good. When we arrived, our toilet was clogged. They immediately sent up someone with a plunger. He fixed the problem quickly, but left the floor totally wet. We had to call him back to dry it. Our room was very tiny with a queen bed. The bathroom was tiny, also, but clean. Because the room is so small, the bed is pushed up against one wall. Some people don't like to sleep up against a wall. The climate control seemed fine, but better yet, there were two small windows that you could open for fresh air. The only real complaint that we had was the low quality linens. The sheets were thin and felt like a blend. If you like the luxury of nice cotton sheets and towels, then these won't do. The thin blanket seemed rather cheap, too. At least the mattress was comfortable. It looked as if either the management or, at least, the name of the hotel is about to change soon. Hopefully, they improve the linens at that time, too.

<Content>Great hotel but noisy A/C was a problem This hotel has a very cool art deco feel. The staff was very friendly and the continental breakfast was a nice perk. The room was nice with a small fridge and microwave. However, when we wanted to use our a/c it sounded like a noisy generator cranking out the air. There was no way we could sleep with that noise so instead of using the a/c at night, we tried to keep our windows open. Unfortunately, our room faced a busy street and we could hear every truck rumble by and every horn honk throughout the night. Our room had a great view of the Space Needle  Downtown Seattle but next time I would give up that view in a heartbeat to try out a room on the other side of the hotel facing the parking lot. It just might make a difference.

<Content>What a great place! We loved the University Tower Hotel. We booked it not knowing where to stay in Seattle. We decided not to stay downtown because it would be too touristy, and this hotel was just what we wanted. We are a young 30's couple, and this hotel fit us to a T! Here's the bad, the rooms are small-but really who is in their room that much, and the pillows are VERY fluffy, but some of you may like that. Now the good-The beds are great! The room is super cute and quiet. They have a great breakfast in the morning and are walkable to tons of cute restaurants and shops in the University District. I recommend going to AquaVerde, just a few blocks away to sit out on the water and drink margarita's personally!It's about a 5-10 min drive downtown depending on traffic, but its nice because you miss most of heavy downtown traffic.

Conveniently located to University area (short walk) restaurants/bars/museums, short drive to downtown Seattle (15 mins. non-traffic), and easy access to I-5. Pleasant staff. Free parking on site which is great compared to some downtown locations. No surprises with continental breakfast. $150/day rate seemed reasonable with competitors.

<Content>What a find! Loved this place We were pleasantly surprised because we thought the price would reflect a run down hotel compared to the price we paid downtown for the W. Free internet in the lobby, great breakfast, stylish rooms and very comfortable beds. Bathroom was small and a little dark, but shower was good. Lobby area has a fireplace and many sitting areas with cool furniture. The free parking is also a bonus - there is a big parking lot behind the hotel for easy in, easy out. Staff nice. The cab ride downtown to eat was around $16 each way, but the money saved on the room fee makes up for being a little out of the loop from downtown. We will stay here again!

<Content>Lovely decor The nicest feature of this hotel is the decor--art deco. It is very stylish.The staff was friendly and helptul.The lobby has actually usable private conversation and lounging areas. The room was small in square footage, but fine. The bath was small and the limited in counter space as it had a pedestal sink and small shelf. The bed was comfortable.I agree with the complaint about the a/c. We too faced the west and had to draw the heavy curtains and turn the a/c on to make it even bearable, never cool. We would have opened the window at night, but the street noise from 45th was loud and constant all night. You might get less of a view, but also less noise if you are located over the parking lot.The continental breakfast was good.

<Content>Modern, clean, great staff, would stay again My boyfriend and I spent 1 night here for a short weekend getaway and we loved it. We're in our 20s and we like the university district. The hotel looks plain from the outside but once you step inside, you'll pleasantly discover a stylish lobby and lounge. The staff was extremely friendly and there is free internet access for guests in the lobby and your first 5 printouts are free. There is also a Tully's coffee right next to the reception area. There is a sizeable parking lot for guests and parking is complimentary.We paid $179US for a Deluxe guestroom and after seeing it, we decided we wanted to pay for an upgrade on their Premier Floor (these are the best rooms with the soaker tubs, all other rooms don't have them). There was nothing wrong with our original room but we decided we wanted something more spacious. They initially told us there was a room available but when they realized it was booked, they gave us a free upgrade to a Premium guestroom (a step down from the best). The new room was spacious, had a lounge chair and a larger bathroom. Loved it! The staff felt bad and even gave us a complimentary movie. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Unfortunately, there isn't counter space for your toiletries but a narrow shelf above the sink. The main door had an air vent that let a lot of noise in and our room was right across the elevator. I was awoken by people coming out of their rooms who were talking somewhat loudly while waiting for their elevator. Try to get a room away from the elevator! Aside from that, everything else was great. If you're into vegetarian/vegan food, there is an awesome cafe down the street called Chaco Canyon Cafe. The mocha smoothie is a must and the pesto sandwich is to die for! There is a Starbucks and Walgreens a block away, a movie theatre, great little cafes, a great Thai restaurant called Araya (closed Sundays) a few blocks down. We spent most of our time in Fremont so we didn't really get to know the area too well. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>A Surprisingly Nice Hotel I recently went on vacation to Seattle last week and stayed at the University Hotel, which I book on Expedia for $129/night. The University Hotel was surprisingly a lot nicer than I thought it was going to be and the hotel staff were very friendly and professional. We checked in at around 1 a.m. and the front desk staff was surprisingly very pleasant at such a late hour. The decor reminded me a lot of what you would find in a Kimpton Hotel and had a boutique feel. Unfortunately the location is not all that great if you do not have a car with you and want to be in downtown Seattle; although the drive is only about 5 minutes. There is however a bus stop a block away you can take downtown. Also another great thing about the University Hotel is that they have a binder filled with take-out menus, from which you can order from local eateries and have it delivered to your room to satisfy whatever cuisine you crave.I would definitely recommend the University Hotel for the great rate I got, which I think is a lot nicer than a hotel you would get at $129/night in downtown Seattle. The rooms were very comfortable and clean with a boutique feel; they also come equipped with a refridgerator and microwave.

<Content>Good value We spend three nights in the UT Hotel and did not regret it. Really nice atmosphere rooms are clean and tidy and freshly renovated, though not too big (at least ours was not). Complimentary continental breakfast is offered and in the bar we could enjoy a very good Jazz quintett together with fine beers from the tap. A bus stop is just round the corner which takes you within 15 minutes to downtown Seattle and if you feel like dining in the University District I can recomment the Indian restaurant which is just round the corner (behind the hotel owned parking lot). Considering that parking is included in the room rate this is very good value for money.

<Content>Best views of Seattle and free parking! This is one of the best hotel experiences I have had while staying in Seattle! We booked a room on a higher floor and hd views of the city that where fantastic. The staff were very helpful and being so close to major road ways helped to get all around the area.

<Content>Great place, great value. I booked this hotel for an interview at UW hospital so it's an ideal location if your travel involves the university. I'm from NYC so I'm used to walking everywhere, so it is within walkable distance to the entire campus within 15-20 minutes. The rooms are very well decorated, clean and mine had a great view of the city. There is a great bar in the basement of the hotel, a coffee shop on the first floor, a great lobby, and a place near the reception to check email which was great.My only complaint was that the walls were a little thin and I could hear my neighbors talking at times throughout the night but it may be because it was adjoining rooms. I'm not sure if all rooms are like this.Parking is free and it is about a 10-15 minute ride to downtown Seattle from this hotel during the day (maybe longer, traffic can be pretty bad).Overall, a little pricey, but worth the money for a pleasant stay.

<Content>Great Value, Loved the Hotel! This hotel was a pleasure to stay in, great friendly staff, nice continental breakfast, clean, stylish rooms, cool decor, centrally located in the Univeristy District. Great value, and very accomodating to provide a shuttle service to the Medical Center. Was able to figure out bus schedule to downtown area very easily. I would definitely recommend the University Tower, and plan on staying here again.

<Content>Great Staff, Great Stay The I-90 pass was closed due to a rock slide and I found myself stuck in Seattle. The Tower staff was very helpful and got me into a lovely room quickly. The decor is nice, if not a little over-done. The room was almost as good as being home.My only complaint would be that the bed was a little hard.I look forward to staying here again.

<Content>Stylish Modern Art Deco hotel -- but bathrooms are small The very stylish art deco decor begins in the 2 story lobby. There's a gas fire place surrounded by bright, stylish furniture, dark book shelves and terrazzo floors. The blue violet velvet panel behind the front desk is repeated in elevators that have aluminum walls and black trim. There are 3 sizes of rooms; I stayed in the middle size($109 per night) with 1 bed and it would have been cramped for 2 people. Floor plans vary from room to room but all rooms have large windows and views. Room decor is also art deco: windows have floor length black  gold striped drapes, beds have shams and bolster; tables and nightstands are light maple finish.My bathroom had a toilet in one corner with pedestal sink next to it and tub on other side of sink. There was no space between these items and the towel rack was almost over the toilet. There was only 1 glass shelf just big enough to hold a tissue box and a spare roll of toilet paper. I had to put my curling iron on the toilet tank. The toilet paper holder was under the pedestal sink's water shut off - and about a foot above the floor. If you want a spacious bathroom or a room with 2 sinks, you won't find it here. Towels were larger and softer than usual; room was equipped with microwave, refrigerator, blow drier, iron  ironing board. The room was very clean. I stayed 2 nights and didn't hear any noise from other rooms. The entire property is non-smoking.  Front desk staff was courteous and helpful. There's a complimentary continental breakfast in the basement and a Tully's coffee shop off the lobby.It's easy to find from the freeway and in the midst of restaurants and shops in the University district.I would stay here again. If you're in the area, stop in just to see the lobby decor (see their web site).

<Content>good place to stay in Seattle Definitely one of the better Best Westerns around. We liked the location near the University of Washington, and the view from our room on the seventh floor was great. The rooms look like they were decorated on the trading spaces tv show--not the most luxurious or highest quality of furnishings, but very thoughtful and creative. There are cheaper, adequate lodging options available in Seattle, but this hotel is still a good value.

<Content>Fabulous views in a great hotel Although the University Tower looks rather plain from the outside, it's a gorgeously renovated hotel in the U District. Don't expect much from the continental breakfast but the ease of getting around, parking, views, and helpfulness of staff make up for what it lacks in free food. Downstairs bar is fun with nice tapas and drinks.

<Content>Be Very Careful About Reservations Here If you reserve a room here, make sure you arrive early to claim it and to avoid our experience.I reserved two rooms here for a colleague and myself through Best Western six months before a major Seattle cultural event we were to attend. We were pleased at the rate for a time when we knew rooms would be scarce and expensive in Seattle. Just before our departure I noticed that the Seattle hotel situation indeed was very tight and that the hotel was offering rooms similar to ours at over twice our price. When we arrived late at night we were shocked to hear that while the hotel acknowledged our guaranteed reservations, it had canceled one of our reservations and sold our room. It claimed it had taken this action because both reservations had been in my name and that the hotel had assumed [without any apparent investigation] that I had made a double booking error. This was an ugly enough situation to find ourselves in late at night even if we'd thought the hotel had erred innocently. However, we soon were convinced that the hotel had decided to ignore one of our reservations and to resell our room at a much higher rate. These convictions were only confirmed to us by the absence of any apology or contrition on the part of the management for such an appalling performance. I cannot help wondering whether this was just business as usual at the University Tower and that we have not been the only victims of such cancellations. In any event, we eventually were able to secure appropriate rooms from the hotel for the remaining six nights of our reservations, and the facilities were fine. But be warned... If you do have a reservation here, arrive early to claim it so that you have a good chance of the management honoring it.

<Content>Loved the hotel and the neighborhood I almost hesitate to write a good review about this place. I don't want it to become so popular that I won't be able to get reservations next time. We stayed at the BW University Tower for 4 days. The hotel and staff were great. The continental breakfast was very good. Tully's coffee is right next door with an ajacent door. There's a nicer restaurant in the basement. Free internet access. The decor is definitely not what one would expect of a Best Western. It's a block from University Ave. There are allot of inexpensive eateries around, a grocery store, and a laundry mat. It was a 15 to 20 minute ride to downtown. There are bus lines to downtown nearby if you don't have a car. We just loved this place. Even though it was right in the middle of a college are the hotel itself was not noisey and there were allot of businese people staying here. We'd stay here again...if we can get a reservation.

<Content>Great Place Very good Value This hotel was great. Right in the heart of UW / downtown area. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance, a movie theatre right across the street, and a farmer's market on weekends within walking distance. This is definitely a young-person's part of town.Hotel was in very good shape, the room we stayed in was very spacious, but as I recalled with the help of another review, there was not much counter space in the bathroom. Wasn't much of a problem for me, but thought I would mention it because it was true. We had a microwave and fridge in our room which was handy for heating-up doggie bag leftovers. They have free computer access with internet connections in the lobby which was nice for checking email, and they even allow you to print directions from mapquest. As other people mentioned, the free continental breakfast is a great value. Not your typical cereal and cold bagel bar. They had a variety of fresh fruit, bagels with toaster, cream cheese, peanut butter, hard-boiled eggs, pastries, orange juice, cereal. The best an included continental breakfast can be. Figure the fact that it is included in the price and what it will save you from buying breakfast out somewhere, and it translates into a great savings. I booked through Orbitz and got a much lower rate than booking through the hotel itself. I can';t remember exactly what I paid, but it was significantly less than the rack rate, so if you are thinking about staying here, you might try that site.

<Content>Great hotel, great location I stayed at the BW University Towers for two nights at the end of August and was very impressed. I travel a lot for work and desire/expect certain things from my hotels. I chose this hotel based on location (needed to be at the University Hospital - only a three minute drive away), price ($120/night), and the good reviews from this site. The hotel is easy to find as it is just off a major road, parking is free and plentiful, check-in was painless, and the lobby area is very unique - not what you would expect from a BW. My room was probably one of the best that I have had. I don't say that because it was luxurious or spacious, since the rooms are small and the decor is nice enough, but my room was tucked away in the corner, away from all the noise of other people and the elevator, with a lovely view across Seattle, and once I was inside, it felt like a little refuge from everything. The smallness of the room made it more cozy and welcoming to me and the bathroom was big enough to serve it's purpose. I could see how two people would possibly have issues with the small space but for the single traveller, it was just fine. The bed was comfortable and the water pressure was fine (14th floor). The coffee shop in the lobby is good - snag a latte there before heading downstairs for the free breakfast. My only complaint with the food was there was no whole wheat bread - minor. The server looking after the breakfast area was great - friendly and fast to clear the tables. He even knew my name by the second day. I believe the highlight for me, food-wise, was the Mandarin Cosmopolitans and the tapas plate that I had at the lounge in the hotel. If you like nibblies and a tasty drink with which to unwind, you must head to the lounge. The hotel is located five minutes from the University Village Mall - a great place to walk around or grab a coffee (three Starbucks) and read the paper after work. The large food store there also has a stellar wine collection. Anyway, to sum up - great, comfortable hotel with friendly, helpful staff and good food and location, all for a decent price. Can't really beat that.

<Content>Not at all like a Best Western First, forget that the Best Western name is on this hotel. Very little about this hotel is Best Western other than the labels, signs, and the reservation system. Think instead chic downtown hotel with a big comfy 2-story lobby that has a fireplace, fancy furniture, attached coffee shop and lounge, all at reasonable prices.The only things about the room that struck me at all like Best Western were the bathroom products and the towels. The bedding fit into the chic downtown hotel category, and the bed was comfortable. Hotel staff were uniformly friendly and helpful, at all times of day and night.My fiancee and I paid a little extra for an upper-story room: these rooms have a view, more space, and a mini-fridge and microwave (both clean and relatively new).There are dozens of eateries, a number of bookstores, a gas station, drugstores, and a Safeway all within a 2-5 block walk in the University District. Downtown is a 7-10 minute car ride away (where you could pay $300-$500 a night for a similar quality hotel). The promotional material doesn't mention anything about internet access, but there was a high-speed jack in our room (bring your own ethernet cable), a modem jack on the phone, and although not officially part of the hotel, the Univ District is full of wireless access, much of it free. For 3.99 a day you can have access through the Tully's coffee shop that is in the hotel building, or if you go outside, you can get it for free through a project designed to bring wireless to the U District. Furthermore, every coffee shop and many other places also have wireless access.The only quibble I had was the water pressure in our room was kind of low (12th out of 16 floors). We definitely will stay here again on a future visit to Seattle. Highly recommended.

<Content>Best Hotel near UDub Stayed at the Best Western Unversity Tower that was recommended by our travel agent. It's a quaint hotel a block away from the Ave (University Way) and another block from the UDub campus. Main purpose for our hotel stay was because our daughter was going to grad school there, we wanted to check out the campus and the surrounding areas. The other hotels in the U-District were not highly recommended.The 5 days there was basically used as a pit stop  resting place to clean up and sleep, the rest of our time was sightseeing and checking our Seattle. The free buffet breakfast was a great amenity and it saved us extra time trying to find a restaurant that served breakfast at 7 in the morning.Check in time was 3pm which was a negative to us because we arrive in Seattle after a 10 hours (with connecting flights) plane trip from Hawaii and we wanted to just check in, take a bath and crash.The hotel is a little funky with its decor and old, small  slow elevators-there's a lot of character with this hotel. We had a microwave and mini-refrig in our room so that was a real convenience with reheating food and storing drinks.Trader's Joe is just a couple of blocks away and the Ave offers some interesting sights. The only thing my wife didn't care for was the small bathroom(no where to put her makeup bag) with backwardsfaucet knobs. Got a clear view of Seattle downtown highrises and the Space Needle.If you're looking for a reasonable priced, clean and well maintained hotel near the UWashington campus, this hotel has the best value.

<Content>The good and the not so good We stayed at the University Tower Hotel for 3 nights. The rooms are a bit small and the bathrooms have no place to put anything, we ended up using the bottom of the side table in the actual room. The rooms are decorated very nicely and the price was great, but the area was not good for walking around (at least for us 'oldies'). One street over are restaurants but more of a younger person's type area, we stuck out like a sore thumb. There is a shopping area about 10 minutes away that had restaurants and was the saving grace for places to eat for us. The deluxe continental breakfast was the best part, tons of pastrys, fruit, breads, cereals, muffins, hard boiled eggs, juices, you name it. You could be there a week and not eat the same thing every day. Our maid service was awful and we even tipped!! Forgot coffee two days in a row, did not vacuum where needed....just not great. So, the good and the not so good......

<Content>Great Deal Great Hotel. You should stay here! My boyfriend and I stayed the night here on a day trip from Portland. The University Tower was BY FAR the best deal we found in the city when you consider what you get. The rating says it's a two star. I work in the hotel industry and can say it's easily a three star. The staff is excellent and the building is well designed inside and out. The lobby is beautiful and includes free computer kiosks which were very convenient.It's not right downtown, but it's a short drive away. Also, our specific room was miniscule but we paid only about 90 bucks for it! WELL WORTH THE SHORT DRIVE AND SMALL room. If you decide to upgrade to a suite this is the perfect Seattle hotel.

<Content>Very happy! Very pleased with the University Tower. I'm a Seattle native and stayed here during my trip home last summer. It has a rather hip vibe to it now- stainless steel in th eelevators and blue flocking on the walls. The breakfastbuffet was better than average- a great selection served in the cozy fireplaced eatery in the lower level. The Tully's coffee adjacent to the lobby was a nice surprise- you can never drink too much espresso! The rooms on the upper floors have great views- mountains or Lake Union. The Ave (University Avenue) is only a block away- lots of shops and restaurants. Room was on the small side but had a big walk-in closet.The only thing I didn't like was having to put all my bags on a cart in the parking lot myself and haul it all up to my room. Would've liked a bellhop.

<Content>Our new fave hotel in Seattle! My husband and I stayed here on a Wed, Thur and Fri in April 2005. I chose this hotel because of the great reviews I'd read on this site, the photos on the website and the unbelievable price we got from Seattle SuperSaver (also a recommendation from this site). It was absolutely perfect for our needs. It was clean and stylish and parking was free. We arrived two hours before check-in and decided to go in and see if they'd let us leave our car in the parking lot a bit early.....to our surprise, they had our room ready and let us check in lickety split!We were on the third floor so didn't have much of a view, but we didn't need one....we were out and about all day long. The bathroom was the same size as the one in our apartment, so while they may seem small to some, it was completely normal sized to us. My favourite part of the room was the chaise lounge which was perfect for watching tv before bed.The cross street that the hotel is on (NE 45th?) was the perfect connection to the University Centre Mall in one direction (best mall ever) and to get to Dick's Drive-In and the Jitterbug Cafe in the other direction.We will definitely stay here again.

The bed was just like those you find in hotels like the Westin and other posh places. It was very clean and made you feel like you just wanted to snuggle up for a great night's sleep and not wake up until the last possible moment! There's no charge for parking (unlike downtown Seattle) which makes it an even better deal. I/we WILL stay here again for sure!

<Content>Much more than expected I have to admit, I'm very critical of hotels when I travel. This place far exceeded all my expectations. Excellent, engaging, well appointed rooms. All don't have mic, fridge and high-speed internet, but they are upgrading all rooms to offer this, and that's the option I chose. Everything worked great. Room was spotless, every day. The front desk staff was enthusiastic and very friendly, at all hours, and surprisingly accommodating. The one criticism (and I'm really stretching here) was that the maintenance staff had an annoying habit of popping on the elevator I was on, while carting along a very large laundry cart, making it difficult for me to actually exit the elevator. Weird complaint, I know, but it happened at least 3 times in 4 days and seemed an unnecessary inconvenience each time.

I have to admit that the first time I stayed here I was a little skeptical of it being a Best Western. I'm definitely a hotel snob and I would rank this place right up with a Westin. The GM, hotel staff and restaurant staff are wonderful. The rooms are spacious and the suites are INCREDIBLE!!! Note though, that if you need high speed internet to make sure to request a room with high speed. Hotel is soon going to all wireless, so this shouldn't be an inconvenience for long.

They were recently decorated with attractive furnishings, were quite large, had good views, and were quiet. Plenty of outdoor parking. Good and free continental breakfast. Also a coffee shop in the hotel for breakfast, but the free breakfast seemed to make the coffee shop unnecessary for breakfast. Many nearby, inexpensive restaurants catering to the University crowd. Its not close to downtown, but there are buses going that way. This is a great place to stay, especially if you have a car.

<Content>Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!!!!! A great hotel at a really reasonable price and very convenient to the University of Washington. I stayed here for two nights during a conference at the end of January 2005 and spent $79 per night for one of their studio rooms. Everywhere was neat and clean and looked like it had been recently renovated. While the studio room was on the small side, it was plenty big enough for what I needed. Double bed, desk, two drawer dresser, tv, huge walk in closet, iron, ironing board and nice large windows. The only complaint was that the bathroom was small and that  made it tough to close the door (no clearance between the door and toilet). Continental breakfast was very nice with yogurt, cold cereals, instant oatmeal, bagels, english muffins, danishes, muffins, fruit, hard boiled eggs and beverages. Free internet access in the lobby and business center with free Wi-Fi in the lobby and lots of comfy couches and chairs in the lobby Fitness center and bar/restaurant in the basement. Front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful and were able to give lots of advice on local restaurants. Definitely a great value and right next to the University of Washington.

<Content>recommended Booking a room at the University Tower Hotel I was bracing myself for the standard two-star Best Western experience. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find little reminiscent of a Best Western property at this location. From its art deco lobby, with its colorful jazz-themed murals, to its well designed and ferociously clean rooms, this hotel approached four star quality. The continental breakfast was rich in variety, though a little tricky to locate in the deepest recesses of 鈥楤鈥?level. There are two free Internet kiosks in the lobby 鈥?handy for checking e-mail and printing airline boarding passes when returning to the airport. And the walk to bustling University Way made for a nice evening diversion. (Grab a drink at Flowers, a remodeled and repurposed nursery, pet the impossibly fat resident cats at Twice Read Tales, or order a taco and a kayak at Agua Verde at the lake end of University Way.) University Tower is definitely a good choice if you have business at or near the U of W. If you are in Seattle to take in the downtown tourist sights, however, this property is not the best choice. While the 71, 72, and 73 buses will get you there in about 30 minutes for a mere $1.50 they can drop you off in some fairly shady neighborhoods. Better to just pick a hotel closer to the city center. University Tower is also not very close to the airport - $40 by cab or $19 for Shuttle Express that only runs on the hour and seems to stop at every hotel along the way.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Value Stayed at the Best Western University Tower Sept 22-Sept. 26 and enjoyed every night there. The staff was very friendly, view was phenomenal (saw the Olympic Mtn. range and if I looked to my left, the Space Needle) and rooms and service were first rate. The location couldn't be better. Seattle's bus system is easy to navigate and the 71, 72 or 73 bus on University Ave (one block from hotel) takes you directly into Downtown Seattle. I had a studio and there was more than enough space for me and my suitcase. The hotel is big on recycling (as is the entire city of Seattle) so be prepared to sleep on the same sheets and use the same towels if you plan on staying more than 3 days (it's not mandatory, but sure is eco-friendly). University Avenue has tons of great little restaurants (Alladin Gyros were great for midnight snacks!) and a slamming tattoo shop (Laughing Buddha; ask for Rain). Will definitely stay here when I return to the Seattle area.

<Content>Don't use their website I loved this hotel, one word of advice...don't use their website to book the hotel-speak to someone in person. They have problems with the website and when we arrived they had no record of us. To make it up to us they put us in a suite on the top floor for a small charge. The staff are friendly and helpful. The decor is beautiful. The lounge downstairs is reasonably priced with great food and live jazz music. If you get a chance to book the suite do so. Big bathroom, huge tub and shower, fireplace, wide screen tv, huge balcony.Great place to stay!

<Content>great experience Stayed at the University Tower after reading the reviews here. It was even better than expected. Fabulously decorated and comfortable room, spotlessly clean, great continental breakfast buffet. Loved the location. Had planned to move to a hotel downtown later in our stay, but liked this area and hotel so much, we just stayed. I highly recommend!

<Content>Great hotel, great location I had a very enjoyable six night stay in this pleasant and relaxing hotel. As a single traveler I stayed in one of the hotel's single studio rooms. The room was spacious with a good sized bathroom and plenty of storage space. The double bed was very comfortable. The room was kept very clean and the hotel was really quiet. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the complimentary continental breakfast offered a wide choice. The University District of Seattle offers a vast range of shopping, eating and drinking experiences but if downtown is your thing, the frequent and very cheap Metro buses will soon get you there. Yellow cabs also seemed to be readily available. The hotel is non-smoking; $250 fine if you do! I'll stay again.

<Content>Good Hotel....Not much life in it.... We stayed on July 25th (which is a Sunday). If you stay there on a Sunday, restaurant/lounge (The District) is not open. That left us having to drive somewhere else to eat. The view is fantastic. The room was clean. Not much of a bathroom. No vanity to speak of. Big walk in closet to hang clothes up. Overall, it was a fancy hotel, but nothing to do while in it. Also no POOL!!!
