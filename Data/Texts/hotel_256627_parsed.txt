<Content>Large Rooms, Central Location Coming to Sydney for a conference I stayed at this hotel for 1 night, before I could move to the hotel near the conference center, which was a shame, beceause this one was better.The hotel is located very centrally in Sydney, which was very convenient. I thought the rooms were quite large with an excellent shower, exactly what you need after a 24 hour flight.The only thing I did not like so much was the breakfast area and the buffet, which cost quite a lot and was a bit disappointing.Conclusion; Good hotel with large rooms and bathrooms at a convenient location, would stay here again.

<Content>convenient location, clean rooms I stayed at this hotel in 2007 for work (APEC), and enjoyed my stay. It was at a very convenient location (short walk to darling harbor) and the room has fridge and microwave. They have hot buffet breakfast included in my rate, which I enjoyed! staff was very helpful as well.

<Content>Good location I stayed in this hotel during June. We had managed to get quite a good deal on a hotel room price and had managed to find it through the Radisson group website.The room itself was very pleasant and it had a great bathroom with a huge shower. The view on the other hand was terrible but its a hotel in a city centre so we weren't too upset about that.  The reception staff were ok but not particularly friendly. The hotel only has a very small eating area which serves all meals. It is just a flight of stairs up from the reception area. The bar is also located here. The serving staff were nice. We didn't eat breakfast here as there are many cafes nearby serving a much better meal at a much better price. We did have dinner one night. We were very tired from a day of sight seeing and didn't want to go out but we found that it was quite pleasant. For every meal they reccommended a glass of wine. The room service menu is pretty much the same as the restaurant menu but slightly more expensive.The pool was a disappointment. The pictures which I looked lead me to believe that it was alot bigger then it actually is.Overall we had a good stay here but felt that it was a hotel geared mainly at business clients.Internet is also quite expensive in the hotel. From the bedrooms you get a free 24 hours but then have to pay 25 dollars per day if you wish to continue. There is a business suite in the hotel but we didn't visit that .

<Content>I love this hotel! I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions in the last few years while on business in Sydney. The rooms are large and its a real treat to have a hotel in which the windows open and with a large balcony. Some people have complained about the noisy location but its right inthe centre of the city. Iwas there while the Pope was in Sydney and Im no sure the city could have got any busier than it was then, but it is the centre of a major city, its never going to be aquiet backwater. I loved the location, but I was brought up in Central London, so I actually like the noise and buzz of a cosmopolitan city.The room service I had was great, and I really appreciated the free internet service - such a change from the profiteering hotels which grab any chance to gouge their guests. The monorail does run right by the hotel, so that might be a bit of a shocker for some peopleI have two minor complaints - it would be really great if the hotel could provide washing machines for guests and I was unhappy to bewoken by someone drilling nearby,in the morning following a flight to Sydney from Johannesburg.In short this is a really good hotel in a very busy location - only stay here if you realy like the buzz of a city.

<Content>Nice for the price We found the Radisson on Liverpool St. to be an excellent value for downtown Sydney. We booked a two queen bed - room and found the room nice size even with two teenagers. The bathroom was very nice and clean. There was a small refrigerator and stove in the room. There were no dishes except glasses. The staff was very friendly. The room was very quiet even though we had a balcony above a busy street. The location worked well for us but we walked everywhere! There were all types of restaurants near us. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>We loved it! I had read the numerous reviews for this hotel and I have to say there are more positive than negative ones.So, I'm going to add my positive review. We spent three nights here and it was fabulous!Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful, nothing was ever too much trouble.We booked a studio hotel room which was perfect for us - we were only there to sleep. The room was situated on the 8th floor and overlooked a building across the street but we enjoy people watching and we saw a few funny things from our balcony. The room was tastefully decorated and clean. It was serviced daily and it was great to see the Radisson helping to reduce their carbon footprint by asking guests to assist with energy saving, this is good to see in these eco-friendly times.We ate in the restaurant a couple of times, which I have to say is quite reasonably priced, the breakfast was great and had a great selection to choose from.The location was just perfect for us as we had travelled to Sydney to attend the Michael Buble concert (which incidentally was wonderful) this was held at the Sydney Entertainment Centre which was a five minute walk away as was Chinatown and Paddy's Market. A supermarket is situated 5 minutes in the opposite direction at World Square. Monrail station is very close by. The closest train station is Town Hall this is two streets away and a good flat walk, great for those with trolley cases coming off the airport train. A tip here, grab a street map from one of the airport stands as the streets are a little confusing until you get your bearings.Sydney is a great city to get around on foot as it is reasonably flat walking and public transport is frequent.Access to and from the airport is great on the train which is $14 one way . We had been told a taxi would be around $50 from the airport. However, that depended on the time of day you were travelling as traffic can become quite grid-locked at rush hour. We discovered a $16 adult day pass which provided access to the bus, train and ferries. We caught the ferry to Manly (which is a quiet spot) and had a wander around, it's a very pretty seaside suburb of Sydney.Sydney is a very large city, which is very busy and it is noisy where ever you go. So, if you are looking for peace and quiet stay out of the city, perhaps Manly or go bush with the roos!

<Content>Basic Accomodation - Not worth what we paid We stayed here on our first visit to Sydney. Although it was near Darling Harbour, I would not feel safe if I was making the journey to the harbour alone.The first room they put us in was looking out onto a wall! The second room was only average. I was very disappointed over all as I expected more from the Radisson. The breakfast buffet was the only up side to the hotel.

<Content>Pleasant stay, friendly staff We stayed for five nights in early April. Previous reviews had made me a little nervous about noise in rooms, but we experienced no problems at all. Our room was a studio, quite spacious with a small balcony, on the 8th floor above Sussex St. Quieter than on the Liverpool St side of the building. Our package, having been booked through business, included a buffet breakfast  free broadband (most welcome!). The small mezzanine restaurant was pleasant but could be a zoo around 8-9am. The staff, including in the restaurant and front desk, were fantastic - pleasant at all times. Having stayed previously in the Sydney CBD, we really enjoyed this location, right next door to Chinatown, Darling Harbour and the blink-or-you'll-miss-it Spanish Quarter. Miros, the tapas bar right next door, provided a welcome late night haven (amazing garlicky prawns and excellent paprika potatoes) after a very long day of meetings. The hotel is about 3 blocks to Hyde Park where we caught buses to Bondi and Circular Quay, and it has great taxi access to the inner northwestern areas of the city (fabulous Italian restaurant called Elio's in Leichhart, cheap ride to Balmain). The Radisson Suites delivered 4 star quality  services extremely well. We will return.

<Content>Excellent service, mediocre apartment Radisson Suites and Hotel was recommended by the conference we attended at Darling Harbor. We stayed a week and wanted a kitchenette and some room to move about. The apartment has a long long (wasted space?) corridor. The kitchen was minimally equipped. Lots of cigaret burns on the 1950's era furniture. Paid $254 a night, a bit pricey for what you get. Would not stay here again nor recommend to someone else. One internet station available for the entire hotel. Pay extra if you want access in your room. The only real plus was location, and the staff was also very helpful.

<Content>Excellent service and staff We stayed in the Radisson in a one bedroom suite for five nights in March. There were two adults a child and an infant. The room was great and the staff were so friendly and accomodating. This hotel was great value for money and in a great location. Darling harbour was a three minute walk and about twenty minutes walk to the Opera house. The hotel facilites were very good and the pool and spa area lovely. The room service offered good value for money although as the suite was self catering we ate in some evenings. One evening it was lashing rain and the Manager ran out himself onto the road to hail a taxi for us.......thats what I call good service. If we were to return to Sydney I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel and location The Radisson Hotel and Suites was a great find in Sydney. Although hard to locate without the address, (not a whole city bock used for the entrance) it was everything we had wanted. Location was great, close to Darling Harbour, next door to Chinatown, and lots of shopping from malls to laundry all within 4 blocks. Staff was very helpful, and very accomodating. Room was big, bright and had a great patio. There were 6 adults in our group and we stayed in a 2 BR suite with 2 rollaways, which were very comfortable. The full kitchen allowed us to cook as needed and keep the beverages cold. We had no problem getting picked up for local tours. The pool and excersise room, although not huge, were very nice, clean and quiet in the early mornings. We would book this hotel again - price was fair in a very expensive city for accomodation.

<Content>Good value Stayed three nights in a 1 Brm suite, containing kitchenette. Very strange suite set-out (not an issue - just odd), as the suite was positioned at the end of the building, and was angled around the building. Entrance contained bench kitchenette with 2 hotplates, large bathroom to the right. Bathroom had basin on one side, makeup bench on the other. Shower was positioned over an extra large roman style bath. This would potentially give problems to people with mobility/knee problems, as the step into and out of the bath is quite high and poorly supported. Otherwise, very clean (except for some minor mould in shower tiles).Further in on the right, the lounge area contained a very tired two seater settee (cheap and hasn't worn well - very little padding and exceptionally uncomfortable). A similar style single chair, also v uncomfortable. Excellent chair provided with desk, but due to the small size of the room, desk positioned immediately in front of the TV cabinet. Sliding door lead out to small balcony, however the view was of high density inner city housing (my colleague in the suite next door kept saying it felt like he was looking out over an alleyway in Shanghai (perhaps also due to the nationaility of the neighbouring residents).Further to the right, off the lounge, was the bedroom with a queen bed (good quality linen, pillows and mattress). Again, a relatively small room, but sufficient. You wouldn't (couldn't) fit more than two people in these suites.Restaurant was poor (breakfast was the only meal taken). Service was slow, hot food ran out, no coffee refills (staff disappeared - off serving room service?)Location is next to Chinatown, an easy walk to Darling Harbour and monorail station. Lots of restaurant choices around, and an expensive 7/11 across the road. Occassional difficulties obtaining taxies due to location.

<Content>Tired but friendly My partner and I stayed at the Radisson this past Saturday and Sunday. The service at the hotel was good to very good; staff were very friendly, and expedited requests quickly. The room was a little tired. While we had a balcony (having booked a one bedrooms suite) this was a mixed blessing, as the room faced the street and the noise on Saturday night was a problem. Sunday night, on the other hand, was fine. The room was very spacious, although the furniture looked a bit tired. Overall, it was OK. The location and staff were great. The noise and the slightly tired decor were the only drawbacks.

Furniture was actually better in the studio apartement.My overall impression was of a hotel that needs to be modernised. No issue with noise [at least for us].The tapas in Miros [next door] were good. Portions were huge.

<Content>A Good Conference Option We booked three rooms - 1 x one bed executive and 2 x one bed suites for a few nights attending a conference at Darling Harbour. The location is great, a few steps to Darling Harbour, Chinatown and the Spanish area with the monorail also very close by. The hotel is on the lower floors of a larger apartment block and has good facilities, pool, sauna, gym ect - all clean and in good condition. My executive on the six floor front corner had a nice but narrow view of the Chinese Gardens, my friends had slightly smaller suites facing Liverpool Street on the 3rd and 5th floors which seemed a little more noise effected than mine. It is nice to have a balcony which is large enough for a table and a couple of chairs if you don;t mind the traffic. This is very central Sydney so noise will always be an issue.All our suites were spacious, well furnished and clean, the bathrooms are very small in relation to the overall size of the suite with an adequate shower over a bath which itself is too small for anyone taller than 5 foot. The beds and bedding were also very comfortable. The lack of a safe large enough for a small laptop computer is dissapointing for a business style hotel. Breakfast was fine but did not otherwise eat at the hotel as there are so many option around the immediate area.The front desk staff were very helpful and responsive and I would recommend this as a great alternative to the conference hotels in Darling Harbour especially if you like a little more space.

<Content>Great location Stayed here on a business trip in a suite which was only a few dollars more a night than the normal room, so check it out when you go to book. The hotel is 5 minute walk to Darling Harbour and your are right beside Chinatown. The room was very spacious, and comfortable. Since it was in the city, there was much of a view. Overall, a very comfortable stay. I would recommend.

<Content>No major complaints as usual. I've been staying at the Radisson now for a number of years and generally find it pretty good,the location is unbeatable,5 minutes walk from Darling Harbour and Chinatown,very close to Pubs/clubs etc ,10 minutes walk to the centre of Sydneys shopping area and 20 min walk to the Rocks where the Opera House and Bridge are.After reading previous reviews i can imagine that if you are in some lower floors there could be a noise problem due to traffic and the monorail but i have always been lucky enough to be given a room higher up.On this trip i checked in late after a flight from Brisbane and the staff were very friendly,there was no one else around and the whole process took no time at allMy room on the 7th floor did smell a bit musty on entering as other reviewers have experienced but in general the room and bathroom were clean and well equipped so no complaints there really.I used the pool,sauna and gym in the hotel which is good although i would suggest that the gym is far too small for the size of the hotel (5 people max at a time),the small bar area is a nice place to meet and have a quiet drink before heading out but i didn't eat at all in the hotel,why would you when Sydney has a fantastic array of eateries !All in all the hotel isn't cheap but you are stying in the middle of a big city and in a great location,no major complaints though and i'll probably stay there next year.Finally my tip for Sydney if you haven't been there before is to walk to the Rocks and take a 20 min $12 ferry ride to Manley Beach,the views of the Bridge and Opera House are fantastic out and back and Manley is a great beach to visit for the day.

<Content>Saved by the SAS Radisson We moved here after vacating an incredibly noisy apartment on the junction of Hyde Park/Liverpool St and were so relieved to be in a decent, quiet property again. We had a one-bed apartment with lounge and kitchen. Nothing terribly fancy, but very comfortable and the bedroom was snug. Although a bit of a distance from the bridge/opera house it's central enough for other attractions. One drawback is the nightlife on nearby World Square where the antics of alcohol-soaked youths is on a par with anything to be found in the likes of Newcastle or Liverpool. Luckily our room was on a high floor: always ask for one on the quieter side of the hotel and as high up as possible. The staff were ultra-friendly and helpful and although this is not a 5-star property you're treated in a 5-star way. Breakfast is fine and the pool and gym are more than adequate if not quite luxurious. As a last-minute booker we didn't get a great deal on price but after the horror of the previous place, we were really grateful to get in the door.

<Content>Never again! As part of our honeymoon we opted for the 'Romantic Interlude' package at the Radisson Hotel and Suites, 72 Liverpool Street, Darling Harbour. I expected a lot more!When we arrived at the hotel the front desk explained we had booked the Romantic Interlude package for 7 nights and would therefore receive a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries every night 鈥?I remember thinking this was a little too much! I was given the impression that people only generally book this package for a night or two. When I originally made the reservation on the Radisson website I opted for the said package but it did not give me an option to book a cheaper rate for the subsequent nights, hence we were stuck with this package and rate for a whole week.Darling Harbour was a stones throw from the hotel but not visible from the Hotel. The view from my Executive One Bedroom Suite was of the monorail and the ramp leading over a busy road to the harbour 鈥?not very romantic.Having just spent the past 10 days in Asia the room was extremely bland and considering the package we had booked the staff had made little effort. The settees in the living area were too small for comfort and smelt of must. The doors to the balcony were extremely difficult to open and when finally open there was no easy way to keep them open, instead they swung closed dangerously fast! Once on the balcony the noise of the monorail and lack of view is frustrating after just a few seconds. The bathroom was ok but the shower was very disappointing (a very small shower head over the bath) and the bath even less enticing 鈥?ventilation could also do with being improved!They suggested they cared about the environment. Their literature stated if we did not wish for our towels to be washed on a daily basis we should leave them hanging in the bathroom, yet everyday we had fresh towels!The room was extremely dusty and everyday there was a fresh layer of dust on all the surfaces. We spoke to housekeeping and they offered to do an extra special job the following day, but even so the dust returned again.After a day out in Sydney we came back to the hotel to find that the door to our room had been left open. I spoke to the front desk, was given a verbal apology and never heard another word. Considering you have to pay to use the safe in the room this is fairly negligent on their part (or perhaps this is their way of ensuring you do pay for use of the safe)!Breakfast was included in the rate, but it鈥檚 not worth paying the extra for breakfast to be included. The food was uninspiring, never seemed particularly fresh and often we had to wait for them to replenish certain dishes. The staff were mostly inattentive and we would go a whole breakfast without being spoken to other than to ask for our room number. On one occasion two members of staff were discussing their gripes about other guests in our earshot making us extremely uncomfortable. On another occasion two kids were sat in front of the TV in the breakfast room, close to our table and we had to listen to both the sound of the TV and the music, which were on simultaneously.Although we had booked the romantic package, there were two nights in the week which they forgot the package completely and nothing was delivered to our room. I mentioned this to the front desk and suggested that with one night remaining there was no point delivering 3 bottles of champagne to our room. Instead they offered to refund the 2 movies we had watched and suggested we watch another for free! I did not want to argue at this point as my wife was already upset with the hotel and last thing I needed to do was cause more upset on our honeymoon.Another issue was the door keys, which on numerous occasions failed to work and at one point it took 4 separate trips to the room to before the manager came and reset the door itself.On leaving the hotel the manager went to collect the car from the carpark and we met him at the entrance to the carpark. We he gave me the keys I saw a note on the windscreen which I commented on, but before I could reach for it the manager had already grabbed if from the car, glanced at it and screwed it up. I was unable to see the whole note but I made out a few profanities in large block letters. I enquired as to the content of the note, but he just hesitantly made some excuses said he would talk to some people and then sheepishly disappeared! This really upset my wife and we left the hotel with a really bad taste in our mouths! Never again would I stay in this hotel and as for Radisson, I will think seriously about staying in any of their hotels again. So much for a 鈥楻omantic Interlude鈥?

<Content>Good location for Darling Harbour and Chinatown We booked a one bedroomed suite for a six night stay in Sydney and the hotel lived up to our expectations.The location was the main attraction. It was 5 minutes walk from Darling Harbour, and 2 minutes to Chinatown, Other attractions, including the main shopping areas, Sydney Tower and the Queen Victoria Building were within walking distance, We had a nice walk (probably 40 minutes) from the hotel through the Botanical Gardens (watch for the bats in the fruit trees) to the Opera House.Hotel breakfast was buffet style, and pretty standard. There was free internet access available in the 'business centre' (a small office with desk).The only negative points I can make is that our suite at some time had contained a washing machine which would have been a useful addition, and that the view from our room was the back of some offices and some scruffy rooftops only a few feet away. On a positive note, the room was exceptionally quiet, and very spacious.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at The Radisson for 6 nights. Hotel is in great location close to Darling Harbour. We booked a 1 Bedroomed Suite which was spacious,clean and comfortable. Yes mono rail was a little noisy but we got use to it. Nice balcony facing towards Darling Harbour. We ate most evenings at Darling Harbour and I found prices reasonable.Didn't use leisure facilities in Hotel but pool was obviously back in use. My only complaint was the quality of the breakfast. The hot buffet didn't look appetizing and was always over cooked no matter what time we ate breakfast. Also I had advised Hotel that my wife has a Gluten free diet and they promised to get in some products for her. However when we arrived for breakfast on the first morning there was a blank look on everyones face. Eventually I went to see the duty Manager and in fairness they did get some products the next day for her.We loved Sydney, the ferry services were superb, the Bridge climb was stunning and The Opera House magnificent.

<Content>Fantastic hotel and location!! My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Radisson for a week and had a fantastic time. Our 20+ hour flight arrived in the early morning, way before check in. However, the front desk clerk was very courteous and helpful and offered to store our bags and we returned in an hour to find our bags taken to our suite for us. The one bedroom king suite was quite spacious and very comfortable. The kitchenette was an incredible addition and we quite appreciated having it. The bed was very comfortable and the balcony just added that extra special touch. The staff were very friendly and helpful and always provided us with ample ice upon request. The location of the hotel is fabulous. Within a 10 minute great walk to Darling Harbour restaurants and ferry. The transportation is also great with a monrail stop and city rail train stop at a 10 minute walk to Town Hall station. We are definately planning to stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a relaxing and fun stay in Sydney. Thanks to much for helping to make this birthday trip an amazing one :)Sincerely,Lucie, Toronto

<Content>Great location, excellent value - couldn't fault it I have just returned from a four night stay at this hotel with my Dad. We had a two bed, two bath suite which had spacious sitting and dining areas, a large, fully equipped kitchen and a big terrace with table and chairs. It was on the second floor and didn't get a lot of light but that was the only thing that could have been improved.Reception staff could not have been more helpful and were extremely efficient. Breakfast was excellent quality and service friendly. Internet access is provided free of charge to guests in a kiosk on the third floor.The location was perfect for our first ever visit to Sydney. Darling Harbour and many other central sights are in easy walking distance and public transport links are excellent.Overall we enjoyed our stay and thought the Radisson offered excellent value for money. I'd definitely stay there again and my Dad is already planning his next trip.

<Content>Frayed but friendly We (a family of five) stayed for five nights in a two bedroom suite in October. Reception staff always smiley and helpful. The pool was closed for renovation but no-one had thought to tell us in advance so my teenage daughters were not impressed. The failure to warn paying guests that a major facility will not be available is unacceptable except in emergency situations. Corridors and rooms probably best described as in need of some cheering up. Our four bedded suite was equipped with four knives, four forks, four wine glasses......you get the picture.The location, in the Spanish quarter, adjacent to Chinatown and Darling Harbour is slightly tatty but very convenient for bars, restaurants and transport.If I were staying in Sydney for five nights again I'd probably pay a bit more for extra facilities and nicer environs but this place is fine for a shorter break and for those whose main priorities are a central location and a clean, comfortable place to get their head down.

<Content>Surprisingly Good We stayed two nights at the Raddisson Hotel and Suites - one night either side of a trip to the Blue Mountains.I must confess that my expectations weren't that high after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor, but my husband and I were surprised once we got up to the rooms.On our first night we were booked into an Executive Suite and for our second night we were booked into a studio, but they upgraded us to an Executive Suite. I have photos of both but had trouble uploading, so will keep trying.PROs:- the rooms were very clean, with good kitchen facilities featuring all the things you'ld expect - dishwasher, fridge/freezer, oven, microwave.- the living room in both suites were a decent size (the second one we stayed in was a bit smaller than the first but still good value we thought)- bathrooms were clean and tidy - the first suite had a double shower no bath, and the second suite we stayed in had shower over bath.- really good location, handy to Darling Harbour, the Monorail, and shops- surrounded by some good cafes and restaurants- the front desk staff were polite and helpfulCONs:- can be a little noisy (street noise) - our first night we were up on the 6th floor and street noise wasn't so bad, the second night we were on the 3rd floor and there was a noticable difference- the beds weren't that comfortable - a little hard, but hey the linen and sheets were clean so a minor complaint really- if you have a car then parking can be expensive here - I think it was an extra $26 a night and you have to pay it because there is nowhere else to park your car around the hotel

<Content>AWFUL HOTEL! There is no way this is a 4.5 star hotel, more like a 1 star. The room was big, but dirty walls and horrible lighting. Very noisy and very uninformed staff. It has completely made me not want to ever stay at a Radisson Hotel again.

<Content>I am glad I chose this one!! Just got back from a wonderful vacation in Sydney. I checked Trip Advisor and the comments were so helpful and true. The Radisson was a great stay. The location can not be beat. It was right down the street from Darling Harbor which we visited almost everday! Our room was roomy and clean. The offered room service daily and the 1 bedroom suite is big enough for a family of 4 ( they can send up extra roll-away-beds for $35 per night). Our room came with a full bar although I wouldn't eat anything from it (chips, sodas and nuts) you have to pay for what you eat and the prices were expensive. It was cheaper to go the the grocery store Coles located up the street for snacks and sodas. I really can't complain though and I would stay here again if I was given the chance. The duty manager was very nice and never got tired of our millions of questions. The waitress Alejandra took care of our dinning needs and really made us feel welcomed whether we were dinning in the hotel restaurant or ordering in-room service ...also the when we ordered food to our room it came up quick and hot!!. I did not like the meat (chicken, fish, or beef) it tasted very different than what I am used to. We loved the dessert. It is pretty expensive ordering food from the hotel but it is an option. There are so many places to eat from within walking distance. There is a great deli (spanish delicatessen )across the street if you just want a real good sandwich and soda. Taxi's galore in the area ( although you really won't need them). China town and Paddy's market is within 5 min. walking distance. Please go to Paddys's market for all of your souvenir's they are 50-70% cheaper than buying anywhere else (same stuff but way cheaper). I went on the last day of my stay and was upset that I did not go there first. So much to chose from ( silk, jewelry, clothes...ect.). We went to China Town and they had millions of restaurants to pick from (some places a little bit ruff looking!) Make sure you get a package deal tour of the main attractions before leaving....was very expensive if you purchased tickets at the door. Kids will love Darling Harbor (parks, play area and sidewalk eateries). Very expensive for dinning out and even for 1scoop of icecream on a cone $4.10. 16 oz soda $3.50 -$5.00. Loved the chips a.k.a. french fries, was the best I have ever had. Not crazy about the fish part. American fastfood restaurants does not taste the same at all! But as the Aussie's say No Worries. Do not do the buy back program at the airport it is not worth it( a fee to have them buy back your leftover AUD$). I doubt you will be bringing any money back from the trip. A lot of things to do with your kids at Darling Harbor very relaxing but fun atmosphere. The weather was mild for winter time but it was raining half of the time but this did not stop us from having a good time. There were sunny days where we sat with the children eating icecream on the docks watching the boats go buy and feeding the beautiful birds. It is a place your family will enjoy.

<Content>Love this Hotel This is an excellent property! I travel to Sydney for business often, and have stayed in many hotels and for the price and location this is GREAT!Although it is down the Chinatown end of town - World Square Centre is one block away for shopping for food or other things. To get to the Circular Quay side of town (Harbour Bridge, The Rocks and Opera House) you can either walk (15 mins), or take a cab. Close proximity to Darling Harbour - 2 mins away.My only drawback with the hotel is the monorail heads right past the window from 7am - 11pm (or until 1am on Saturdays). I did get used to it though.I stayed in a one bedroom suite, full kitchen, seprarate lounge and free broadband internet! Nice and roomy.Fantastic property - will be staying here regularly from now on.

The most important thing about this hotel are the staff who are extremely helpful, friendly and kind. I was highly impressed. Im going to stay there again thats for sure!!!!! I would grade it A++++++. Please do go and stay there and find out for yourself its worth every cent spent.

Free Broadband (yes, FREE! and fast too).The gym  pool were tiny ... but there is a fitness first down the road. I didnt sample the restaurant. But every morning, they had $2 coffee in the Lobby (very good 'Vittoria' coffee).Room had a kitchenette. But no utensils. I didn't ask for any, but I am sure they would have brought some up, along with a smile.

<Content>Excellent staff Hotel is well sited with the Darling Harbour area of Sydney a few minutes walk away. The suite was well equiped, included a kitchen (and utensils) and had a decent internet connection, although the bedroom was a bit on the small size. The one thing that makes this hotel special is the staff, they go out of their way to help you, whether giving directions, talking about Sydney or arranging tours they all go out of their way to give 110%.

<Content>Fantastic. What a location! We have just spent the weekend at the Radisson Suites in Sydney. We were on a girls weekend away so wanted to be near everything. Well we were. This is a great location. We walked to Darling Harbour, Paddy's market and the city. We were also in walking distance of the ferry to Circular Quay and the Rocks. The staff here were wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble. We were at the back of the building so did not experience the noise, however as with previous reviews, I could see that the front units may suffer a bit as the streets are quite busy until the early hours. We were also just down the road from Chinatown. The breakfast buffet is lovely. We did not eat at the restaurant for dinner or get room service mainly because we were always out exploring Sydney. The pool and spa were a hit with us and there is a gym as well. Also a business centre. This hotel has it all. And for a group they were willing to split the king beds to singles for us. We found this one of the most economical hotels as breakfast was included and we could walk everywhere. I highly recommend it.

Accomodations were perfect, hotel very clean, staff extremely helpful. Approx 1- 1 1/2 miles to Sydney Harbor, and an even shorter distance to Darling Harbor. Just a few blocks from Botanical Gardens and Anzac Memorial. A great deal for the price. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic! I am sure that there are much more opulent hotels you can stay in, in Sydney but if you want a good priced hotel in a good location with excellent facilities you cant go wrong - there is nothing bad to say about this hotel.The hotel staff were always pleasant and could not be more helpful when recommending day trips and restaurants. Internet conncetion is also free for hotel guests in the business centre.We stayed in a standard room which was HUGE! The bed was ennourmous and we had an area with a desk and sofa. The bathroom is very spacious and the room also boasts a kitchenette area - perfect for travelling families! The room was serviced every day and always clean. The hotel is about a two minuite walk from Darling Harbour, which has a huge aray of restaurants and bars. In the other direction - the main shopping area and the QV Building is about a five minuite walk.There is no need to travel to a meeting point for your tours as they will collect you from the hotel.

<Content>Loved this Amazing Hotel Im on Visit no.2 I just returned along with my cousins from this hotel in Sydney it was unbelievable and amazing actually this is trip number 2 to this hotel and ONLY will stay at this hotel in Sydney. This hotel is centrally located for everything just at the hear of darling harbour which is superb. To me there is no other hotel in Sydney as this hotel.The Staffs are so welcoming and very accommodating hats off to the staffs who were on duty october 25 in the a.m. also on the 22 of oct. The staffs are always smiling. The best also of this hotel especially for my cousins they loved the free internet. Anyway usually Radisson are very good hotels but this is exceptional its all about LOCATION,LOCATION,great big rooms, lovely amenities, and amazing staffs, I really did not eat at the hotel as there are so many restaurant and other dining options at your doorstep. I also loved the monorail by the hotel. I recommend a friend to this hotel and should was very amazed and loved it. Please dont hesitate to stay here its amazing.

<Content>Great Stay The four of us stayed there for 3 nights in a 2 bedrooms suite in early October. We arrived early in the morning when the room was not ready but a front desk staff was quite gracious by leting us freshen up using the pool facility.The suite we stayed in was extra spacious with 2 bathrooms, full size kitchen, living room, and dining area. It was aslo very well kept and clean. Another great point was the fact that the suite was facing toward the back of the building....no street noise. As for the location, the hotel is situated in a safe area 5 mins from Chinatown, 5 mins from Daring Habour, 10 mins QV shopping arcade. I loved this hotel and will stay there again. The only thing we cannot comment on is the food.

<Content>Good hotel for value at convenient location I went there this Oct with my wife and two kids (11 and 9 yr). We book a studio, which they allow all 4 of us to stay in one room. Their beds are queen size which is ok for one adult and child to sleep. We arrive from the airport early in the morning, although the room is not ready but the reception is very eager to check us in and take care of our luggage. He also suggests a near by McDonald since our older kid is hungry.The location of the hotel is great, very close to China Town (1 block) which you can find tons of food throughout the day (recommend BBQ King if you like Chinese). Also, about 1-2 block to TownHall Station (CityRail) and Woolworths Supermarket. Since our price didn't include breakfast, so most of the time we self-cater in our room. They provide basic kitchenware also, if you request.The size of the room is ok, not that large but since we're not staying at the hotel all day so that's not a problem. Their bed and sheets are very comfort and the cleaning is very good.If we gonna go back to Sydney, this is the hotel that we will choose. The price is ok, great location, nice staffs.

<Content>Fantastic hotel for budget minded travellers This hotel was great. My wife and I had a room with a kitchenette and that was convenient. We booked on-line for $209 AUD a night which included either free buffet breakfast for 2 or a $50 credit which we used towards room service. We were able to book this rate on-line and still had the option to cancel without penalty with 24 hours from the reservation. The hotel is located a few blocks away from the Museum subway station and a monorail station (don't bother) which is convenient. If you like walking, you can walk from the hotel to Circular Quay in about 30-40 minutes. It's also walking distance to Darling Harbor which is also nice. The hotel is located on the cusp of Chinatown. We took a cab to and from the airport which ranged from $25-$35. If you tell the driver to take the non-toll route, you'll save on the cab fare. We would definately stay at this hotel again if we're in Sydney. It was great value for the money!

Quiet enough for all of the family (including 3 small children!) to sleep during the day, while still being really central - 2 minute walk to Darling Harbour and shops, restaurants, monorail etcWe thought it was very good value and met all of our requirements for a stopover stay.

<Content>Excellent for the price We stayed here with another couple last year. We searched for a good deal on the internet and came up with the Radisson. We payed around $120 I think, for the night and that included breakfast. This is right next to the harbour and by far the best option around! Breakfast was great and we spent the evening in the pool. The rooms were actually pretty big and opened right up on the street and provided hours of people watching! A good choice for the price and area, service wasn't that great through.

<Content>Beware room 719 This is our second review of the Radisson the first one we gave it a very good review but advised against a room on the monorail track we should have stuck with the monorail. We have since returned  this time assigned a totally different room. Room 719 is at the back/side of the hotel a totally different config to the previous room. Kitchen is only part of the dining room(not a seperate room) no table or chairs to sit at for any meals you may wish to take in the room. But it was the poo view that turned us right off. This room faces a brick wall on the right painted with pidgeon droppings  the view in front is of the next door office block where one could nearly read what was on their computer screens Yes we can hear you say well you are not in Sydney to stay in your room but not all of us are on holidays where one tends to spend most time away from the rooms we are only in Sydney for business which is why we choose the Radisson for its proximity to the Exhibition Centre in Darling Harbour  as such we do spend mornings  early evenings in the room attending to business  unfortunately the desk is placed directly in front of these views thank god for the blinds which we promptly closed. The view from the bedroom was of the housing block at the back with its green water spa Staff still most obliging  the now free broadband is a big plus which tends to negate the negatives a bit. Tend to think that if you book directly with the hotel (which we did 1st time) you will get the better room as we booked through an agent this time. Still the location is excellent as handy to Darling Harbour/China Town  city.

<Content>Excellent Location The room we checked into was surprisingly big which included 1 bedroom with a generous closet, spacious and well ventilated bathroom with a selection of amenities , open kitchen with some utensils, living area and even a room to store luggage. In room broadband is availableThe restaurant did not seem very tempting but there are lots of cafes near by to grab a coffee and some breakfast.There is limited hotel parking spots available in the garage that is connected to the hotel. Approx $20 Australian a day which is a great rate seeing how expensive city parking is in Sydney. The location is the best for walking ! Right in the middle of China and Korea town. Lots of groceries and restaurants around - you will never go hungry. 10 minute walk to Pitt and Elizabeth street where all the luxury shops are located and great walk to Oxford Street where all the speciality shops, paddington market and cafes are.Only facility that needs improving is the gym. The equipment are a bit old and there is not enough ventilation in the room which makes it hard to breath in while exercising Definately would stay there again

Nice beds - comfortable to sleep in knowing your room is dark enough to get a full sleep out of a night.Suite came with a kitchen and the like. Pretty nifty addition if one has to say so. I've stayed here twice already and will stay here again no doubt about it. High floor rooms are good with a view to go with it.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for easy access to Darling Harbor and night life in Sydney CBD.

<Content>Most comfortable room! I would definitely love to stay at this hotel again for my next visit to Sydney. The standard room is excellent, very spacious with comfy double beds. The bathroom is also big and clean, and though we did not use the kitchen, it was handy to have the long table. The monorail noise was not a distraction and the construction written by earlier reviewer was finished so no complaints from me on this. I also found the location is very strategic, just few minutes walk to CBD, restos and cafes. My only advice for improvement is that the housekeeping should clean the rooms earlier than in late afternoon. Overall this hotel is very good value for guests looking for no frills lobby - just comfy rooms and strategic location.

<Content>Hotel overbooked us and we lost our first night stay! I was really looking forward to staying at the Radisson having already read previous reviews about the hotel. However our stay was overshadowed by their appalling overbooking procedure which resulted in us losing a night at the hotel. I want to make other readers aware that we had booked and paid for this hotel in July 05 for our stay in November. We had a late flight into Sydney and didn't arrive until approx 11pm. At reception we were then told that there had been a maintenance issue with one of the rooms during the day (a flood) and that as a result the hotel was full and there was no room for us. I queried how this could be as having already booked and paid for the room in July surely we would have priority over later bookings - apparently not. After the reception guy continually tried to fob us off with the maintenance issue I asked him if he would just admit that we had lost the room because we were last to check in. After diverting all questions on this issue and after asking to speak to someone else, the Duty Manager admitted that we had lost our room because we were last to check in (I don't think we will ever know if there really was a maintenance issue). Anyway they said they wanted to book us into the Avillion Hotel on the same road. I agreed on the condition that I could inspect the room first. However the Avillion were not prepared to hold the room for inspection so we were then checked into the Four Points and the Duty Manager drove us to the hotel in a minibus. The Duty Manager agreed that our room would be ready the next day and we asked they contact us on our mobile the next morning to confirm this. As we never got a call we returned to the Raddisson the following morning. Even then they got our bed requests wrong so were left waiting a bit longer for a suitable room. Staff advised that the initial offer of a complimentary breakfast would be increased to a free meal and wine in the hotel restaurant which we accepted. A written apology was also waiting in our room. This poor start would put me off staying here again, although I cannot fault the room - it was enormous with 2 double beds and full kitchen area (though no utensils). Our complimentary meal was excellent though the service was really slow and there were only 2 couples in the restaurant at the time.The pool was a welcome bonus and lovely heated spa and sauna.Overall a very nice hotel - just don't take the risk of turning up after 11pm at night!
