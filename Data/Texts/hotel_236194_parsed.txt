<Content>Great low cost hotel The good: it's a great place for it's price, and contrary to what some have said it's actually quite close to the center -- a direct 10-15 minute metro ride. Once you figure out the shortest way to walk to the metro station it's only a 5 minute walk. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the bathroom was a little worn but otherwise OK. The staff was generally friendly and helpful and even let us check into one of our rooms three hours early. It's helpful that the hotel can be booked right on their website http://www.hoteles-catalonia.com/hc/hotel.do?opcio=detalleid=99The bad: the walls are very thin so you hear noises from all over the hotel and street. Since it is in a quiet area of town with little night traffic it is quite possible to sleep well at night even if you are a light sleeper, but trying to sleep during the day could be more difficult. The walk from the nearest metro station is uphill and the hotel can be difficult to find the first time. The food in the cafeteria is not excellent and I recommend taking the option of a room without breakfast. This is not a high class hotel so if you want to treat the special person in your life look elsewhere, but it's good value for the cost.

<Content>Quick 2 nights away Too far way from the centre, very very basic but clean enough. We only booked because it was cheap but now we realise why ! You only get what you pay for. 20 mins from the centre by tube and a 10 minute uphill walk from the tube station. Nothing in the surrounding area, seems to be residential. I would only stay there again if every other hotel in central Barcelona was fully booked !!! In my honest opinon hotel is ok if you don't mind planning your trip by the tube timetable.......

<Content>only if you like dust in your room At arrival, the desk manager told us about a problem with hot water, so they try to change us to another hotel. We didn't agree, so they gave us a room. Only the minimal confort, but we foun over the phone, tv, and radiator, dust of several days; and in the bathroom, a coackroach. The food at the restaurant was good. I won't come back.

<Content>Catalonia Rubens-Great Location and nice! I just got back from a student tour to France and Barcelona organized by www.explorica.ca. The highlight of the trip was Barcelona. The hotel we booked, Catalonia Rubens, was great, convenient, trendy, nice breakfast and safe. It is located right by Parc Guell (Gaudi Park)---Cannot miss this attraction. It is located 5 min from the Vallcarca metro stop and if you're tired at the end of day, a cab ride is 10 euros. the metro ride to city centre is less than 10 minutes. From the airport to hotel, it is 25 euros. The rooms are roomy, bathroom are supplied with amenities and a blow dryer (not all euro hotels provide this). The staff there were friendly and informative. The breakfast there was buffet style, with fresh baked bread, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese, yogurt, cereal, orange juice, coffee and tea. I highly recommend this hotel!!

<Content>Nice little hotel I recently stayed at the Hotel Rubens in Barcelona with an Explorica student group and this was a great little hotel. It was a 10-15 minute walk from the Valcarrca Metro stop and very close to the Parc Guell. The buffet breakfast was excellent with lots of variety and freshly baked pastries/bread every morning. Rooms were also a decent size and modern. - Irene, staff member of Explorica (www.explorica.com) an educational tour company

<Content>Not impressed Well, for a 3* hotel, i was certainly not impressed. The layout of the rooms were very odd, although nice and clean.The food options were the worse though!! I am a vegetarian, and there were not many vegetarian options whatsoever. Not only that, but there wasn't a variety of food full stop!It leaked in the restaurant on two occasions and even a cockroach came to say hello to us! It was a very disappointing stay in general and i certainly would not be going back there in a hurry.

<Content>Average This is hotel is the definition of average Its clean and that's it. The Pictures if you haven't noticed are showing only the ground floor which is really new and stylish. However the next 4 floors are a bit dated and lifeless. Don't book with this hotel if you've got family cause we had a room for 3 and i slept on a wooden plank and a mattress the size of a suitcase. Also don't rely on the electricity, one night we were completely without it and suddenly it got a bit warm. But if you're looking for a quick city break with your partner I would probably recommend it to you cause its location is brilliant.

<Content>Ok for the price you pay We've spent 3 nights in this hotel. We've booked a double room but when we got there we received a twin room, we asked them to change the room but they said they didn't have any available double rooms and that we should have specified in the reservation request that we want a double room with a queen size bed( on the site we've booked a double room was described as a room with a double bed, so we didn't think we had to say that again).The hotel's location is not central, but it's 5 min uphill from a metro station, so it's ok if you don't mind walking. The rooms are simple and clean, but extremely noisy. We could here our neighbours talking, showering, etc and the cleaning lady working in the hallway and the rooms nearby. And as she starts pretty early, it was pretty difficult to sleep.The front desk staff speak English and are very friendly. We didn't take the breakfast in the hotel as it was too expensive. They ask 12 euros/pers for buffet breakfast, while in the restaurants on Les Ramblas we didn't pay more than 15 euros for both of us, including drinks. If you plan to spend a lot of time in the hotel we don't recommend this one, but if you need a clean place to sleep at a low price, it's ok.

<Content>absolute nightmare I have just got back from staying at this hotel. Please can someone offer me a chiropractor now as i have such back pain from sleeping in the most noisy uncomfortable broken bed for a week.I booked into the hotel thinking it looked close to town and from the photos it looked ok.The reception area is very misleading, its nice there, that is until you get out of the lift and onto your floor, where you step into a time warp. the wooden doors are all bashed up, the wallpaper is some type of rattan wicker nightmare with browning cream walls.the first room i was given was a strange triangle room, where if i closed my eyes i felt like i was alongside the grand pre circuit. it was so loud from the traffic.As i was there on business i asked for a quiet room as i couldnt sleep.I was then given a small coffin room where there was enough space to just get out and into the bed, which was broken.It was quiet from traffic, but this time all you can hear is everyone else talking and making noise. After another sleepless night, and worry of impending impaling from the coils in the mattress i asked for a new mattress, or some help flipping the old one over, the lady at reception moaned at me to the maid, thinking i didnt understand them, then sent the handy man up, who confirmed that the bed was broken and he would fix it tomorrow, he didnt come the next day or the next or the next after that. i complained each day and i felt like i was being annoying to them! they werent bothered at all that i was sleeping on a broken bed, infact the staff give you the impression that you are getting in their way , especially if you want to go down in the lift whilst they are doing the cleaning, there are no seperate lifts for them , so be wary of making them wait, one cleaner was quiet annoyed that i happened to join her in the lift.other than all that, the food was cheap if you like your burger to swim in its own grease you'll be fine..Dont go dont go dont go..

<Content>Noisy Location is not great. But the Taxi stop is very close and the metro about 5 mins downhill. Room was a bit plain but the bathroom ok. The biggest problem was the noise from the traffic and other (young people / school groups) in the hotel (No sound insulation at all...). Bring your own ear plugs to this place! Hotel didn't have a real restaurant, only a 'snack bar'. Breakfast and personnel did their job nicely. Rooms were also very clean.

<Content>Served its purpose - not bad was a bit worried when i saw the other negative reviews, but my wife and I found it fine.Firstly, when you come out of the metro, make sure you go up the escalator into the higher level street (has Argentina in the street name), this takes away a lot of the steep slope, so its a pleasant 5 minute walk up a manageable gradient.Rooms are a bit basic and need a bit of a refurb, but were clean, maids came in every morning and cleaned and re-stocked soaps, shampoos etc.Breakfast we thought was very good, loads of choice, choice of fruit,cereal,bacon,eggs and sausage, pastries, croissants, filled rolls (which we took for lunch - naughty!)Staff ALL spoke english and were very helpful, some excellent tips for restaurants, one particular one called Mossel, lovely Catalonian food and very reasonable price.We were maybe lucky with fairly quiet residents, but we could hear the neighbours in the next room which I can imagine could be a pain if you have lager louts next door.All in all good location for seeing the city, clean and functional, would consider staying again.

<Content>not the best option, nonetheless reasonable Second time in Barcelona, and booked this hotel mainly for the price. Location is not its best feature, however there's a metro stop (Vallcarca - Green line) at about 5 minute walk.. Concerning the hotel itself have to say it's a bit depressive one. Nice lobby and entrance bar but the rooms are small, old and need urgent maintenance. Stay away from low floored street rooms unless you like noise.The main breakfast room is on a 1st floor with low ceiling and no windows... Only after 2 days did we discover that you can have breakfast on the restaurant upstairs. Much nicer and breathable. The breakfast itself is poor in choice but satisfying and adequate. The staff: would not say rude, just uncaring... they seem to not care at all if like it or not...In general, would not recomend this hotel unless you're on a thight budget (would rate it at max 80,00 Eur per dbl room/night).There are much better choice in the fantastic city of Barcelona

<Content>Economical and nice location I was at this hotel from May 20-28th. The hotel is in an area of Barcelona called Vallcarca. The hotel is walking distance to great restaurants, supermarkets, shops, cafe's ect. The hotel is also walking distance to Parc Guell which is very beautiful and a must see. I enjoyed staying at this hotel as the area of the city was very pretty and full of culture. The metro is a short walking distance (3 minutes) from the hotel which will take you anywhere you want to go in Barcelona. I would take a taxi at night back to the hotel which only cost me about 10-12 euros from the Olympic Port area. Is the hotel rooms small? yes the room is small, but you really only go there to lay your head down at night so for me it didnt matter and I was quite comfortable. The room was always clean and for me it was great and the price was right with my budget. The bed was not as good as home but I never had a problem sleeping in everyday. If you are a super light sleeper and a very cranky person who gets bothered by other people and noise, I would stay somewhere that has soundproof walls since the hotel can be a bit noisey at times but it did not bother me nor did I let that ruin the wonderful experience of staying in Barcelona and Vallcarca. I would definately return back to this hotel in the future.

<Content>I would not return We booked and paid for our room in advance as we knew we would be arriving late. We chose to book the hotel as it offered parking (we had a car) and also that it had a 24 hour reception.On arrival, we encountered a very rude employee who told us the car park was full and we would have to find a park on the street. He was not interested in helping us. I confirmed our reservation, and then we spent the next hour looking for a place to park our car on the street. We then trekked back to the hotel with our heavy packs (this was a 10 minute walk on hills) to discover that in the meantime he had rented out our room to someone who walked in off the street!! ( we had booked and paid for our room and confirmed our reservation on arrival, so we were not impressed) He continued to be very rude and made no attempt at an apology. He called a neighbour hotel and told us we would need to get ourselves there, so we ended up paying for a taxi to and from the hotel. At 3am in the morning, he advised that a taxi would be at our cost as the hotel was within walking distance. This was not feasible with our luggage, and our car was now parked some distance away!I would not stay at the hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone. The customer service falls short of expectations and I felt the facilities were not as represented on the website.

<Content>Utter disgrace We booked this hotel because it had a car park and 24 hour reception as our flght was to arrive later in the evening. Upon arrival my partner asked where the car park was and was told (with attitude) that it was full. This was a major problem as the hotel is surrounded by narrow one way streets with no parking. We drove round for an hour and eventually parked. When we finally got back to the hotel he told us (again, with attitude and without apology) that the hotel was full and we had no room, even though we had prepaid and he knew we were coming after seeing him for parking instructions. After 30 mins the solution he arrived at was that we pay for a taxi to an affiliated hotel and stay there, then pay for another taxi back again in the morning.This is the worst service I have received and would like to warn others of this so they can avoid it.

<Content>Okay with Huge attitude! The hotel was all right, but the staff was not pleasant. Whenver I called or asked a question they were not welcoming pr friendly and completely discouraged me. The staff was rude and could not figure out what room I was in to relate that to friends and family when calling. One particular hotel representative told my friend to call back using a better phone and hung up abruptly!Breakfast- was all right not memorable.Dinner- was hard to tell what it was, but not appetizing to look at.I would recommend this hotel only if you are on a budget and could deal with rude people.

<Content>in a pinch..... Stayed at the Catalonia for a large Exhibition/Congress in Barcelona Feb.06. Paid EU120/night, which is probably 2x normal price. General comment: very loud - I had a room off the staircase/elevator and there is nothing to damp the noise. Street noise was loud also, the rooms on the main street have to put up with things like 4AM garbage collection. Room was clean, but certainly starting to crumble a bit around the edges. Beds adequate, TV worked fine, bathroom ok except for air shaft with window opening across to neighboring bathroom, so you can hear everything....Breakfast was decent, when I was there, you could have bfst in the lobby bar or the first floor breakfast room. Lobby bar was much more pleasant atmosphere and similar selection of food/drink.Last night I was there, tour bus with teenagers arrived and created lots of noise. There was a security guard wlaking through the halls around midnight.Staff certainly weren't overly friendly; I didn't really ask anything of them, so no chance to see how they would react. I took the risk to have a shirt cleaned and got it back after two days instead of one. This is always risky at tourist oriented hotels. WLAN access worked ok, cost EU9.00/two hours from Swisscom.Location is pretty convenient to the subway, about a 7min walk downhill from the hotel. There didn't seem to be a large selection of shops and restaurants nearby, a small grocer was uphill from the hotel. I took a taxi in from the airport, it cost EU25; from the Fira to the hotel, I can't remember exactly, but a taxi was less than EU10.Summary: If you want a quiet place to stay in Barcelona, or are a business traveler, this is not a good choice. For groups of younger people, seems good enough.

<Content>Don't bother What a place! As soon as we walked in we were impressed going wow this is pretty good for the price, the room wasn't bad to they eye and clean.However it was a nightmere, froze in the middle of the night because the airconditioner was not properly fitted to the wall letting in gushes of wind through. The staff were incredibly unhelpful and very rude. We had our laundry done there which was a big mistake since it cost 85euros (more than our room!!) and we received attitude while getting it back!There were also school kids staying there who made noise till after 1am. After people complained staff went to repremand them however they took the sides of the kids saying people have been complaining about you, sorry do keep it down but don't worry too much (did this outside our room where we could hear it all!)Such disgusting attitudes not worth your time or money.

<Content>Very noise teenagers We went for a week-end trip from Denmark to Barcelona, and we have found this hotel on the internet, because we want to stay near Parc G眉ell.The hotel was good, the breakfast very very good, and the staff friendly - but the noise!!!There were quit many school classes, and they were so noisy, so the last day at 22.30 we got out of bed, and asked for another room!! We could not sleep.We got another room on the 5 floor,and it was okay. But it is not okay, when you have to pick all your things together late at night and move.It was simply not possible for the staff to keep the hotel quit.But anyway, very nice hotel, very nice price, just ask for a room far away from school classes!

<Content>YAY for the Catalonia Rubens Great accommodation! Air con is a BONUS!! The breakfast was AMAZING!! The bed was very comfortable! The bathroom was nice (bath included). VERY CLEAN!!The only criticism would be it's slightly too far away from town - you need to catch a taxi or the underground rail service.

<Content>Reasonably Okayish I would firstly like to inform you that I was with a school group and so as a pupil may not have received the best of everything as the hotel would give to their ordinary customers.Location - near to the metro, but far away from Las Ramblas, in a residential area. Not a good location, in my opinion!Food - absolutely horrible!! Well at least it looked horrible, I cannot comment on the taste of it as I could not bear to even look at some of the food. I can only comment on the other people in the group and well sickness was shared by most who ate the 'pinky' cold meat, which I can only guess was salami. However other people were fine with the food - it just depends what you're like. Rooms - these were fine - nothing great, nothing bad. Clean and insect-free with a clean bed and air conditioning and a television although a little tacky.Staff - fine, until the last day when they literally told us to leave our luggage in the reception area even though we asked where to put it. After returning our luggage had been 'impounded' and they demanded 120 euros[about 拢84] to relese the luggage - absolutely disgusting!!Overall - an okayish hotel where I couldn't eat the food - not exactly 3-star standard.N.B. These are my opinions, so read others I may just be fussy or picky so please don't be put off if you have booked here. If you were thinking of going here take my opinions into consideration

<Content>Great hotel just out of central Barcelona We got a taxi to Catalonia Rubens so the steep up hill to get there wasn't a problem, however, if you're walking there it is about a 15 minute walk up from the train station. The room was clean and quite spacious, soap, shampoo, tissues and shower caps were provided. There was also a TV and air conditioner. The room looked out at a mountain with a church on top which was beautiful at night especially. The hotel is not in the centre of the town but in a pleasant, quieter area with shops nearby. It takes about 15 minutes once on the train to get to Barcelona central. The reception staff were helpful with tourist information and maps and spoke English. The continental breakfast was quite expensive and in my opinion, not really worth it. Overall, I can definitely recommend the hotel.

<Content>Silver lining to the cloud: Great breakfast! Everyone on the staff was very friendly and helpful at this hotel this past June, 2004. However, the room was very cramped and a little run down compared to other hotels of the same category. The walls were also very thin. We did have a wonderful view of Tibidabo amusement park. However, that also meant we had the street noise. We are both very fit people so we didn't mind the hike to get up to the hotel from the Vallcarca metro station. However, if you are not fit, take a cab w/your luggage or after a long day sight seeing. The surprise of the stay was the phenomenal breakfast! It was one of the best during our 2 weeks in various hotels in Catalonia. Also, if you like hiking, Guell Park is just up the hill from the hotel!

<Content>Get on the step machine This is an ok-ish place - the staff are friendly (and if you at least try to use just a few simple Spanish words - like hola  gracias! it makes a big difference. Safe, clean, straightforward rooms, no views, but outside is so amazing why sit in your room?For me the giggest thing AGAINST this place is that it is such a climb up from the metro (watch out which exit you use at the metro too, it makes a BIG difference - exit straight right). As you arrive at Metro Vallcarca exhausted from your day's sightseeing you are suddenly faced with some serious hill climbing (and with a suitcase it is no fun!). And when the metro is closed definitely get a taxi. Also, the lifts in the hotel are iffy; 1 broken  1 broke down while I was there and after the hill walking, up to the 6th floor is tough on the knees. But at least it keeps your backside in trim! HOWEVER, you are a few minutes (hill) walking from Park Guell which for Gaudi lovers is the great thing about stopping here. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Not great The sheets were clean, the beds comfy and the breakfast was good - on the downside, the staff were rude (that's if they noticed you were there), the rooms were noisy with a lovely view of a road about 1 foot from the window and the rooms were pretty poky. Not recommended if you don't fancy a 10 minute uphill walk from the Metro every time you head back.
