<Content>Attention to every detail! We stayed at Grand Hotel Francais for 3 nights. My husband and I have travelled quite extensively and have stayed in many beautiful hotels, Inns and BB's over our travels, and this hotel was no exception. It was rated as a 3 star, but it really could be closer to 5 stars. It was recently renovated and the room was beautifully furnished in very contemporary expresso furniture and pretty textiles. The bathroom, although the smallest we have ever had in our travels, was also very nicely done. The breakfasts in the morning were filling and very nice. A great assortment of cheeses, cereals, yogurts, and pastries. (The croissants were phemomenal - I will never be able to eat another croissant from Canada again!) Also, the gentleman at the front desk was always very friendly and extremely helpful with directions, making dining reservations, even advising us where to get the best Dijon mustard to take back home and he offered to mail our postcards! Also, the restaurant Les Gallopins was recommended to us by a lady at reception and it was wonderful! (must order the Fondant au Chocolat avec Creme Fraiche - worth every calorie!) Our stay in Paris was wonderful, in large part to our great accommodations. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>3 Star Hotel with 5 Star Service! The Grand Hotel Francais was recently renovated and the room we were in was immaculate. One of the best showers I've ever used in a hotel. The service was amazingly friendly and helpful. Every suggestion they made for restaurants was spot on and you could tell that each member of the staff took a lot of pride in their service. The Nation neighborhood doesn't have many Paris sites, but is minutes away from all due to the fact that 4 or 5 major Metro lines run through the area. We enjoyed the fact that it was less of a tourist area and soaked in some real Parisian atmosphere. People in the neighborhood were very friendly as well.

<Content>A 'Grand' Hotel We have just returned from a wonderful long weekend in Paris.Having decided on our hotel based mainly on Trip Advisor reviews, the Grand Hotel Francais exceeded our expectations! The Management and staff were all very helpful and friendly.Our room was spotless, roomy by Paris standards and the bed one of the most comfortable we have slept on for a long time. The hotel is very convenient for the Metro, which we discovered after walking almost the length of the Boulevard Voltaire on our arrivalCan't wait for a return visit to Paris and would certainlystay at this hotel again.

<Content>hotel not a disappointment We must have just been unlucky with our experience of Paris, because what should have been a lovely time was ruined by at least 3 encounters of very rude Parisians and very expensive prices. [expect to pay at least 拢4-拢5 for a beer and 拢4 for a small wine most cafe/bars]But it was completely outweighed by the fact that the Hotel was a pleasant haven to rest a weary head. The manager should have been promoted long ago,-I will never again meet such a Man who was so happy to help and rectify any problems- he was wonderful.The stay was very comfortable and the room [small but ample] clean. The bed was the most comfortable I have stayed on.The only gripe I have about it was that there were no Tea and Coffee making facilities, and being an avid tea drinker and one who takes ages to get ready whilst consuming at least 4 cups doing so, was a disappointment.The other thing...[and I feel awful having to say this because nobody else has] ...is that breakfast was a little uncomfortable [ bit too intimate! ] as we had to keep sharing a table with someone because the room was so tiny [ a converted cellar I think] and there was a maximum number of tables- so if everyone came down at once in the morning it would be chaos!!! The lady waitress was a bit slow on the uptake and didnt understand much of what we were saying but we just didnt let it get to us.Nevertheless this hotel is good value for money and I agree with most of the comments made and the manager has done his best to make sure nobody has a bad time.

<Content>Definately returning Me and my boyfriend stayed at this lovely hotel for 2 nights in February. This was a christmas present from him, so I was a little worried about whether this was the right decision when choosing a hotel. Upon our arrival I we were pleasantly greeted by the friendly staff. They were extremely helpful when pointing us in the right direction of monuments and even advised us to visit particular attractions.We were also very happy with the standard of our room. We are aware these have all now been fully refurbished, though we were still delighted with the general cleanliness and homely environment. We were unaware that our room also had a balcony which wsa a pleasant surprise, as it was very nice to sit out on and drink wine when we came back. The continental breakfast was superb, I could not fault it one bit. I am not normally a great fan of cheese and bread and european breakfasts, however the options were vast and the food and service was of a high standard!We loved our stay so much we have actually booked to go bak on the 31st December for 2 nights again, over New Years. We cannot wait to revisit Paris and this wonderful hotel again and see the new rooms. We are also hoping we get a balcony again, as this was an additional, nice touch!Myself and my partner would definately advise anyone to visit the Grand Hotel Francais...the hotel and staff and location is all great and anyone would enjoy it!10/10!!A big thumbs up!

<Content>Excellent hotel When booking this hotel, my girlfriend and I thought the reviews sounded too good to be true. However on arrival we soon realised that the reviews are to be believed. The hotel itself was very easy to reach from the airport by train and metro (about 45 minutes in all), with the walk form the final metro stop to the front door taking no more than two minutes. The rooms themselves are compact, but this seems to be the norm across Paris. Despite the space the room was in brilliant condition and a pleasure to stay in. The staff were most friendly and extremely helpful. For the price of the room, I would challenge anyone to find a better hotel in Paris. Thank you!

<Content>Friendly hotel experience We have just returned from a 4 day stay in Paris. Chose this hotel due to the excellent reviews and we were not disappointed. Still some upgrading of rooms on level 1 and 2 going on, but only during the day and we were out all day anyway. Had fantastic room which even had a table and two chairs, lots of bathroom space with an excellent shower - Room 61. Had two windows but a step up to the little balconies, not direct as on floors below. The bed was great, and nice crisp linen. It is only minutes from a Metro station or a short walk to the main station. In a quiet area by night, but felt safe enough. We booked for tours (Moulin Rouge and Night Seine Cruise) and had a great tour of Paris on our return journeys as we were always last dropped off. The staff at the hotel are excellent, friendly and helpful. We owe a special thanks to Jacques the night porter who made our coffee how we like it each night on our return, and made me a cup of tea each morning. They recommended local restaurants and we chose their top pick on the one night when we were not heading out, and it was excellent. Les Galopins was a superb restaurant and had an English speaking waitress. Would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Praise for Grand Hotel Francais Myself and my boyfriend stayed at the Grand Hotel Francais last week (13th - 17th) and were very happy with our stay. After reading tripadvisor reviews we decided to book the hotel as we had got a good deal. We could not complain at all about anything in our room (61) everything was perfect from the decor to the air conditioning. The space available in the room was fantastic and the shower room, especially the shower with jets that was fantastic. We had 2 small balconies whcih the doors opened and as we were on the top floor we left them open. On holiday it is always a thought sometimes to come back to your hotel but not here we felt very relaxed in the room and enjoyed coming home to sleep. The service provided in the hotel was brilliant, the cleaners were very thorough in the rooms and the reception staff were brilliant - especially the young girl who gave us so much info regarding places to go and how to use the metro. We didnt have breakfast in the hotel but there are so many patisseries near by we just bought from them. We also ate in a recommended restaurant, Les Galopins, it was a fantastic meal, we thoroughly enjoyed it and wasn't too expensive. The metro service is easy once you get used to it and 2 stations were nearby rue de boulets (line 9 - took us to eiffel tower) and nation which has a lot of lines going through and also RER A which takes u to Disney (35mins). We mostly walked to the attractions as the weather was good, the walks are very enjoyable. One thing the hotel didn't have was tea and coffee facilities so we brought our own kettle as we like a cup of tea (Milk is available at near supermarket). We took a Taxi to the airport the day we left because we had an early flight cost approx 45 euros - make sure you are waitin for the taxi and not the other way round (On arriving at the airport we took the RER B to gare du nord then line 5 to oberkampf and then 9 to Rue de boulets).All in all our stay in France and at the Grand Hotel Francais was fantastic. thoroughly recommend it.

<Content>loved the museum d'orsay My daughter and I have just come back from a great 4 days in Paris. We would recommend visiting the museums especially the Louvre and d'orsay. On the night we arrived we went for a meal in the city centre. The bill came to 45 euros for an average meal. I wasnt impressed when I found out 2 glasses of orange juice cost 23 euros! Apart from that the hotel is in a really good location. Nation is an easy station to get to and its about 5 minutes walk to the hotel. The breakfast was ok in the hotel and the room was small but adequate. (Room 63). I would recommend this hotel. Paris is such a great place to be at night. Take a cruise along the Seine at night, its so nice to see people sitting by the river bank, relaxing.

<Content>Great value, new furnishings. My husband and I just returned from a week in Paris at the Grand Hotel Francais. This hotel is a real gem. The rooms are newly renovated and very well planned. Our room was small, but no more so than other European hotels. It had great storage as well as a safe and small refrigerator in the room. The bed was firm and comfortable. The lighting was excellent, with lights over the bed for reading and an alcove next to each side of the bed with an electrical outlet (my husband recharged his phone there each night). The bathroom was clean and new with great water pressure and hot water. It also had plenty of space to put things (very rare for Europe, I've found). This was our 5th trip to Paris and this was the quietest room we have ever stayed in. We were not woken up by road noise which was really unusual for Paris. Our breakfast was included in the room deal we got through Travelocity and the breakfast was so good that we ate there every day. It had pastries, breads, cereals, fresh fruit, meats, cheese, yogurt, etc. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, too. The hotel is not in the central part of Paris, but is right next to a metro stop and a 5 minute walk to Nation, which connects to many more metro lines. We could easily get anywhere in Paris from the hotel on the metro. This is a great little hotel and a great value for Paris.

<Content>Remarkable considering costs. I stayed here for my anniversary in April. The renovated room was impressive. While expectedly small, the room had a pleasant feel to it and the furnishings were surprisingly high-end (lots of nice woods and great ceiling work.) TV is flat screen and shower is much better than what you usually get in Europe.The hotel is close to two metro stops and is in a decent part of the 11th arrondissiment. Nation metro stop should get you anywhere you need to be.Staff was far better than expected. Manager is fluent in english and just about everyone else there spoke at least a little of it. Cute little bar at entrance and decent breakfast room (though 10 euro per person was steep for petit dejuner.) Only real complaint is slow elevator.The best part of the room was the cost. You can get a package deal for under 110 euros per night. Though this is $175, it is Paris and is about half of what you'd expect to pay for a hotel of this quality (closest other hotel on street was same price and a dump.)I work for a high-end hotel chain in the US and even talked the place up to my cohorts (some of the better items could easily be replicated here.) I would recommend this to anyone (couples, kids, pensioners) though you should ask for the highest floor possible as the lower rooms are not yet renovated (ok but far inferior.)

The staff and management were extremely friendly and helpful. Our travel agent went into administration shortly before our trip which was a bit of a problem, but the hotel sorted things out for us and smoothed over what could have been a bit of a nightmare- so we were really grateful.I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, as we throughly enjoyed our stay.

View from the room was lovely and looked out over the Paris rooftops.Location of the hotel was good, excellent rail links and it is possible to walk to the main attactions if you don't mind walking and the weather is nice, or you can get a cab. We found a lovely restaurant nearby called the Marco Pollo (if it's still there).

The staff at this hotel are really fantastic, so friendly and helpful.

Like a previous reviewer we ate at Les Galopins twice too, amazing food and good prices. Would reccommend to anyone.

<Content>Great location and value Excellent choice for us overall.....great location a stone's throw from Nation, one of Paris' primary hubs with RER and four Metro lines (1, 2, 6 and 9) and right above Rue des Boulets station on Metro no. 9!!! So convenient to get all over Paris and easy to and from CDG airport...only 8.2 Euros each way---$12!!! Mgr. Zyad and his whole staff were very helpful in every way; they recommend restaurants and cafes nearby; just ask! Our room was newly renovated 100%...bathroom was ultra modern and fresh. Our only little problem was with the computerized phone system but that was resolved. Ask Mr. Zyad to make you a cup of LaVazza double latte espresso at the bar!!! Hope you enjoy Grand Hotel Francais and the staff as much as we did recently. I Love Paris in the.......... Bobby and Jeannie Moon, Houston TX

<Content>ok choice for a stay in Paris we stayed at the hotel in August for four nights. It's an ok option, with clean rooms, a good breakfast (for France) and friendly service. The room was quite small though, just big enough for a double bed and a tiny adjacent bathroom. The hotel's location is quite convenient, close to metro and RER lines and you are quickly everywhere in Paris.The service is very good and staff at the reception extremely friendly and helpful.If you get a good deal on the room rates, definitely worth considering.

<Content>Second Time Around My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hotel Francais for the second time in June 2007 (the first time was in 2003). We decided to stay here again as we found the hotel so convenient for the Metro and the RER and as you are so near to Nation you have the bars, supermarkets, restaurants etc within easy walking distance.We found the hotel to be clean and the staff very friendly - they can't do enough to help you. The breakfasts are great and the range of pastries brilliant.The only thing I would say about staying in this hotel is be aware that it is an old building and therefore it does not have great soundproofing. The hotel is situated on a busy road so you will get traffic noise. We could also hear the people in the next room use their shower and flush their toilet - it was so loud that it actually sounded like they were in the same room as us. I didn't remember it being this bad from our first visit.I would recommend this hotel for your first trip to Paris as it is so convenient to the RER if you want to go to Disneyland Paris but if I do return for a third trip (I love the city so much) I would probably look around for another hotel.

<Content>Not bad but not great! I stayed in the Grand Hotel francais in 2005. Being my first trip abroad I was a little weary and it did not help when we checked in. I tried speaking French to the manager on the front desk by asking him if he spoke English. He replied to me by sayin no i do not speak English I am a stupid French Idiot!. This did not make us feel very welcome at all! Then our room was not ready so we had to go back in 2 hours! We booked our 3 night stay on the internet and from its description sounds great...only 10 min from central attractions...this is Bastille, not central Paris. Admittedly the metro is only accross the road but it took us 30 min each night to walk to the Bastille to get a bus to then get another bus into central Paris. So overall not a great location, there are lots of hotels more centrally located and same price.the room was very small and the shower had no curtain and the shower head you had to hold up yourself so the whole bathroom got wet!Breakfast was very nice though all you can eat and a great variety.Overall i'd say it's not the best hotel in the world and if you want to see the sights of Paris without travelling every night, look for somewhere more central.

<Content>Nice! We have just arrived back from a two-night stay in the Grande Hotel de Paris, and it was very nice hotel in a central location near Nation/Rue de Boulets Metro stations.Check-in was pain-free with fantastic help from the lady on reception, who also pointed out how to get to the main attractions easily on a map for us.The room was a little small, but it was comfortable, clean and well-equipped. The shower was lovely and powerful and had nice fluffy towels, but could really do with a shower curtain!!!Breakfast was superb - croissants, pastries, cereal, fruit salad, yoghurts, rolls etc This was included in our rate, but I think it was 10 euro otherwise.We had a nice meal last night, after going through Time Out Paris for tips, and after realising that you should really book in advance, we found upon a nice traditional bistro restaurant about 10 mins walk from the hotel, called Au Vieux Chene (rue du Dahomey - we got so lost trying to find this road and the restaurant kindly gave us directions over the phone - but it's right by the corner of Rue Faidherbe and Rue Chazny by the Faidherbe Chaligny metro station). Well worth a visit and the pork was fab.Beware of beer prices though, even off the tourist-trap areas you could get stung for 12 Euro a beer - check first!!

<Content>The perfect place for us My son and I stayed at the Grand Francais in March of this year (2007) and it turned out to be the absolutely perfect choice for us. We had a corner room on the first floor with three French balcony windows, very bright, it was small, but clean and completely sufficient for our needs. The staff, and particularly the hotel manager, were friendly, upbeat, helpful and happily for my sad French levels, spoke English very well. The area of Paris the Grand Francais is located in may not be right at the centre of all the tourist action, but that's one of the things that's nice about it. We did all our sightseeing downtown during the day, then came home to a very lovely residential area in the evenings. Still well within the city, but quieter, and very easily accessible to everywhere by Paris's amazing Metro system. If I'm ever lucky enough to return to Paris, this is where I'll definitely stay again. Thank you, Grand Francais!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We have just returned from a two-week European vacation, having spent our first four nights in Paris at the Grand Hotel Francais. The hotel was terrific, an excellent value, and I would recommend it to anyone. Zyad, the daytime manager of the hotel, (who speaks English) took time everyday to provide us with city maps, directions, and whatever assistance we needed to navigate the city. He couldn鈥檛 have been anymore helpful.The hotel itself is very nice. Its located close to a metro stop, which we found extremely helpful. The rooms are fairly small by American standards, but are standard European size. Although clean and quiet, don鈥檛 expect many amenities. The hotel was a great choice, and we would gladly stay there again.

Extremely clean and cosy! Even though it's on a busy street, it is sound proofed so you're guarenteed a perfect nights sleep! It's right next to a metro station that connect you with the rest of the city. I will definately be back to stay here. I'd recommend it to anyone on a budget and wanting to visit this amazing city!

<Content>We'll be back! My husband and I spent part of our honeymoon in Paris and had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hotel Francais. We booked it as part of a flight-and-hotel deal, and after our stay there, we think we made out like bandits! Our room was very large with a huge bathroom, had a nice view of the side road, and was very clean. It smelled a little bit of smoke (the front desk had warned us that it is hard to keep people from smoking even in a non-smoking room, so we were prepared), but we had brought some Febreze with us (I never go to a hotel without it now) and that took care of it. The location is phenomenal -- close to the Metro as well as bakeries, fruit markets, and restaurants, the front desk staff was very helpful (directed us to good restaurants, helped us buy our Metro pass, and cleared our confusion about how to get to Versailles) and converses well in English. We will definitely stay here again, especially if we get another great deal like we did!Some tips: buy the museum pass -- we loved being able to choose places off the beaten path simply because they were free. Eat at Cafe Bonal near the hotel; the food is amazing. Skip the hotel breakfast, instead get almond croissants from one of the nearby bakeries and some fresh fruit from one of the markets. Pain de Pomme and the Brioche Doree have great sandwich/dessert/drink deals, perfect for the budget traveller!

<Content>Nice hotel! We stayed at the Grand Hotel Francais first weekend in March and found it to be more than adequate for our break.Our room was of an average size, in fact by Parisian standards, I'd say it was big, even! The shower room was pretty small but how long do you spend in the shower room anyway? The room was cleaned every day of our stay and the beds made. The beds were comfortable but the pillows were not! If you have room in your case, pack your own pillow! I slept with 3 and they were still too thin! Overall, the room was clean and comfortable.Breakfast was more than adequate with pastries, yoghurts, cereals, jams, juices and tea or coffee and replenished frequently.Staff were really nice and helpful and will tell you where is good to eat/which metros to use/train times etc etc.Would definitely stay again!

<Content>great choice I have just returned from four nights at the Grand Hotel Francais. I booked the hotel because of the many good reviews from the tripavisor, and I am glad I did so. The staff were pleasant and very helpful, and the rooms were nicely decorated, warm and cleaned everyday. We also received fresh towels and soap daily.The location is superb, with close metro links. My partner and I used the Nation metro station because it had a number of lines running through, and you could get to a lot of places without having to change trains.The breakfast had a great continental choice, although i don't think I would have paid for it seperately if it hadn't been included in the price as the tarif showed it to be pricey.I would definately stay there again, and recommend it to all travellers to paris who are looking to travel on a budget. You can be assured that you are getting a good quality hotel.A little tip for fellow travellers, the price of beer is really expensive. With the price of a pint being up to 8 euros. However if you go into the little cafe bars in the metro station, you can get a beer much cheaper. Also one of the turn offs at the nation roundabout has a cinema, next door to the cinema on the right is a small bar that had a happy hour between 6-8. The price of a nice pint was 2 euros!! Not sure if that was only on saturdays though because it wasn't open on sunday.

<Content>Good value for money We went to Paris for a weekend and stayed at the Grand Hotel Francais. It took some time to find a hotel in Paris, as with London, there are so many to choose from and we didn't want to spend a fortune but also didn't want to stay in a dump. Grand Hotel Francais was a very good find! Hotel is in good condition and clean and staff helpful. We requested a room on the higher floors and got a spacious double room with a balcony on the 6th floor. We paid 鈧?60 for 2 nights including Breakfast through booking.com and really couldn't complain! Also, the location is handy. The hotel is situated in the Bastille neighbourhood with around 2mins walk to Rue des Boulets metro and about 5-10mins to Nation (metro). You can also walk to the Pere Lachaise cemetary in about 20mins.

<Content>Excellent place I stayed at the Grand Hotel Francais for a week between 28th Oct - 4th Nov 2006. What can I say it was a truly brilliant place to stay. It had everything i expected and staff that really would go out of their way to help. Especially the guy (sorry can't remember your name) he was behind the counter during the day. No question about Paris, parisiens or general tourist questions were too difficult. He helped with the most important one during my stay, where can I buy cigarettes? for those of you who dont know, unlike us in the UK were we can buy cigarettes pretty much everywhere, the french have funny licensing laws about tobbaco only allowed to be sold at tabacs, three of which are quite close to the hotel, but don't go looking a 10pm on a sunday night! Unlike some of the other reviews i read about the Grand Hotel Francais I already knew about the Metro and how every city in the world should have one, it is about a 2 minute walk from the Rue de Boulets and about 5 mins from Nation, were you can get the RER to Disneyland. The hotel is a good distance from the centre of paris and most of the top sites but with the metro you are only about 20mins from most places. We walked to Pere La Chaise in about 10 mins.The rooms were small but well kept, lets face it when you are in Paris, how much time do you spend in your room anyway.I cant really think of anything else to write some if you have any questions, feel free to ask me i'll be more than glad to answer them. Unlike some who tell you to search for it.

<Content>Pleasant economical stay in Paris My husband and I spent hours on the internet trying to find a decent hotel in Paris and we were very happy we chose this one. It is conveniently located near the metro and there are lots of eating places in the vicinity.The staff were hospitable and very helpful. Despite our limited knowledge of French they went out of their way to help us plan our 3 day itnerary. The room was small but clean.The noise from the road was not really a problem for us as we were on the 5th floor and kept the windows closed as the weather was chilly. For a 3 star hotel we were happy with the service/facilities.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!From a couple in London.

<Content>Great location This hotel is in an excellent location for access to the metro.The room we were in was on the small side but was clean.We were on the ground floor, which should be avoided ,as the metro rumbles underneath from early morning to the small hours. We had booked for bed and breakfast and were astonished when, while checking out, we were told we had upgraded to a buffet breakfast and had to pay extra. At no time were we made aware that we had a choice for breakfast. The only food available in the dining room was laid out buffet style and we assumed that we just helped ourselves. So watch you aren't caught out by that one! We're still at a loss to think what the breakfast we booked should have been. Any ideas?

<Content>3rd wedding anniversary we were celebrating our 3rd wedding anniversary and i decided to take my husband as i had stayed in paris 3 years ago for my hen weekend and enjoyed my stay.we arrived at the airport and i had pre booked the taxi with the hotel, which worked really well last time i stayed in paris, we waited and waited and the taxi had just not bothered to turn up, great start we thought, eventually we arrived at the hotel by booking a taxi at the airport, i was a little annoyed at this, but upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a male receptionist who was annoyed when i told him what had happened and said that the hotel would pay for the taxi on our departure.check in was quick and went to our room, very clean but small!!!!having read on the trip advisor that the rooms were very noisey due to the hotel being situated on a main road, i thought we would take that chance, being in the hotel industry and knowing how much we customers like to complain about anything given the chance, i thought we would risk it!!!! oh how wrong i was, it was like being in central london!!! the room had no air conditioning and the room was warm due to the nice weather we were having it meant we had to keep the windows open!!!!, if you can survive on 4 hours sleep great, i can't, my husband though did sleep like a baby but i as a light sleeper found it very annoying!The hotel has great staff who will help where they can, showing you on the maps where are great to eat, drink and do some sight seeing.The hotel is in a great location about 10 mins walk to Bastille which has some great watering hols if you go off the beaten track, you will find it cheaper to drink and eat as paris is very expensive on the main drag.the metro is a great and easy way to get around which we found out on the last day.don't think we will be going back to paris in a great hurry.

<Content>Friendly hotel in great location We agree with the other reviews that have commented on the friendliest and helpfulness of the staff in this hotel - they really are nice. And as described, it is in an excellent location for sightseeing plus you can book organized trips with them - we loved the one to Versailles and the trip on the Seine.However, we must also agree that the noise level from the road is pretty bad. As it was mid-June and pretty hot, shutting the windows would have meant suffocating. They definitely need air-conditioning so the windows can be kept shut.I would stay here again but in the Winter!We had a lovely time despite the road noise.

<Content>lovely small hotel - perfectly situated for seeing the sights Our stay at the Grand Hotel Francais was part of a Newspaper promotion with travel by Euorstar. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful and informative. Our room was better than the ones I''ve seen linked to this site, plus we had a balcony. Everywhere was exceptionally clean and well cared for. The only drawback was that as it was so hot at night we had to open the french doors which meant traffic noises were pretty loud (we were road facing). However, the location of the hotel was great for getting around Paris on the Metro. They also allowed us to keep or luggage at the hotel for the whole day after check out at 10am (our train was not until 6pm). I would happily stay there again i we went back to Paris.

<Content>Not very baby-friendly If you're looking for somewhere to use as a base, this hotel is ideal, as it is close to the Nation Metro station, from which you can get to almost any part of Paris. It is also handy for dining out, and shopping for either clothes or local produce.And we have to say that the staff were very friendly, the room was a decent size (although you could barely turn around in the shower room). However, there was no air conditioning, so when the temperature soared to over 33oC it became extremely uncomfortable. A travel cot was provided for our baby and our bed was very comfortable. However, we put the baby on the carpet in our room to crawl around and when I picked him up, his hands, knees and feet were black. I'm not sure when they last cleaned the carpet.Also, the restaurant was OK, but there were no highchairs, and they would not allow us to take the pushchair into the restaurant. The first morning we had to feed our 14-month-old on our laps, which almost resulted in scalding hot tea being spilled everywhere. The second morning we had to feed him in the lobby and take it in turns to go and have breakfast in the restaurant.Apart from this, we had a very nice time there.

<Content>Fantastic staff, shame about the room After reading the reviews on this site, I was really looking forward to our stay in this hotel, unfortunately I was disappointed. Although the hotel is somewhat out of town, it is close to two metro stations, so the city centre is easily accessible. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, probably the best of anywhere I have stayed. Unfortunately the same couldn't be said of the hotel room. The room was of a reasonable size, but smelled strongly of damp, due to what looked like years of water leaking in through the windows. Tthe bathroom was very small, making getting in and out of the shower a bit tricky. The room was fairly sparsely furnished, a few drawers for clothes would have been nice, and the door was difficult to shut, the housekeeper inadvertently left it open one day as they hadn't shut it forcefully enough. That wouldn't have been as much of an issue, if there had been a safe in the room. Although the road noise was audible and the vibration from the metro was noticeable, it wasn't an issue. Breakfast was a little pricey at 鈧?0 a head for a choice of cold pastries, cereal and rolls. The hotel can recommend a number of restaurants in the locality, the Italian a few doors down didn't get a mention, but is certainly worth a visit, as the food and service there was excellent.All in all, a friendly, welcoming hotel let down by the quality of its rooms.

<Content>Fantastic staff The staff at this hotel are extremely friendly and helpful (even with a sense of humour!) and I fail to see how anyone could not rate their service as excellent. The rooms are clean and tidy with everything you need and ours (on the 6th floor) even had two small balconies and plenty of room for our baby's cot. There is a little noise from the metro but again the higher floors are quieter if you can get them. Its about a 2 min walk to a metro that takes you straight into the Champse Elysse and about a 5 min walk to a larger metro station serving various other locations. Def recommend for a reasonably priced hotel with friendly staff suitable for a short city break. Would have no hesitation staying there again - lets hope I get the chance!

My partner had booked this hotel for my 21st birtday and although it is not in the City Centre we found it very pleasant, friendly and relaxing. A great walk to all the tourist destinations passing lots of local shops on the way.My partner had requested for some flowers to be put in the room for our arrival, the flowers were presented beatifuly in a vase. The hotel staff are very helpful, telling us how to get to places, showing us on the map,booking reservations for dinner and taxi's to destinations. The rooms were very clean and had everything we needed for a fantastic weekend. Would recommend this hotel and would love to stay there again.

<Content>Terrible services! I found this socalled Grand hotel by tripadvisor and booked a double room by phone.The hotel is near subway, Although the location is good, but the services are awful. After my GF and I checked in, we found the room is very small PLUS it's very noisy B/C it's third floor and towards the street. So I called the reception to switch the room. But the reception refused to do so, because ALL THE ROOMS ARE FULL. What a lie! We checked out immediately. That's the worst hotel I've ever stayed.

Room is small (but perfectly big enough to 2 of us for 3 days) and comfortable, bathroom clean and tidy with fresh towels every day and good water pressure from the shower.Enjoyed the choice for breakfast - baguettes, croissants, cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit salad, juice, meats and cheeses.Supermarket across the road was very convenient for essentials - water, etcHotel is in great location, literally just 2 minutes from the nearest Metro station (Rue des Boulets) and bus stop (direct to Gard du Nord).Would definitely chose to stay here again.

<Content>Our trip to Paris I want to write a review on this Hotel in return to a great service that we got from them. Me  my husband stayed here for 7 nights last February  we had an awesome stay in Grand Hotel Francias. The room is enough for 2 people  they clean it everyday. The only thing that amazed me was the bathroom. It's has bathtub without a shower curtain, and so we have to sit down while taking a shower or else the whole bathroom will be wet. :) Aside from that, everything is fine.The staffs were great, specially Mahina  the manager/owner. They were so helpful to us in finding our way.The hotel is 1-2 minutes walk to the metro station, bank/post office, there's a grocery infront where you could buy fresh fruits and a lots of bakeries around. We didnt take the breakfast in the hotel because there were a lot of places to eat around - cheap!!I would definitely come back in this hotel on my next trip to Paris.Thanks guys........

<Content>Great Hotel Myself,my mum, my godmother and her daughter stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and could not fault the hotel. I found it to be great value for money. The rooms were very clean and very comfortable. The staff were so helpful and friendly, and really ensured that our stay was comfortable. The breakfast was good with a choice of baguettes, croissants, pastries etc. This is by far the best hotel i have stayed in when visiting Paris (this was my 4th visit.) It was only 10 minutes into the centre of Paris if you take the nation metro line to franklin d roosevelt which locates you to the middle of the champs elysees. Around the hotel were plenty of restaraunts we ate in these every night and never had a bad meal. I would certainly advise anyone to stay at the Grand Hotel and will definately be staying there on my next trip to Paris.

<Content>Marvelous, Darling My best friend and I chose this hotel after researching the comments on this site. Our experience far exceeded our expectations. The hotel was immaculate; the staff was wonderful; the room was toasty warm in chilly Paris; and after walking all day it was wonderful to come back to the hotel for a hot and steamy bath. I highly recommend you ask Zyad, the manager, all your tourist questions. He is a wealth of information and a delightful conversationalist. Also take advantage of the wonderful location to either walk or take the nearby metro to your tourist destinations. I hated to leave; I would highly recommend the hotel for great location, price point, comfort, and staff. Marvelous, darling.

<Content>Little treasure Stayed here over the new year period having booked after reading the existing glowing reports on here and was not disappointed. The hotel is small but the entrance is welcoming and the staff exceptionally helpful and friendly. Our room was on the 5th floor and was compact but satisfactory. The french windows were a welcomed touch and the full size bath also a bonus. Furnishings were basic but more than adequate for our stay. The hotel has a small breakfast room which serves continental breakfast from 7-11 every day and has a good selection of breads, cheese, pastries etc.The only downside to the hotel was the thin walls and you could hear other guests through the night. However, with it being new year this was to be expected and all these typical french buildings probably have the same problem.Although not centrally located, the hotel is a couple of minutes walk from the train and metro stops at Nation and from here you can get pretty much anywhere... 10 minutes on metro to champs elysee/louvre.For anyone wanting a comfortable break in Paris without spending a fortune.. book this hotel.. you wont be disappointed!

<Content>Really great little hotel We just returned from Paris on November 24, 2005. We stayed at the Au Grand Hotel Francais and loved it. We much prefer this type to a large chain. THe hotel staff was genuinely helpful, spoke great English, gave the best recommendations and directions and was just generally great. They fixed us a tray of tea every afternoon; so civilized! The location of the hotel is very convenient to the Metro (subway); the entrance was just across the street. Also, there were two great bakeries across the street where we had fresh croissants and pain de chocolat every morning for breakfast. And a wonderful little Italian cafe a couple of doors down. We would definitely stay here again.

It is on a nice boulevard with some basic shopping facilities. The rooms are pretty small (just like other Paris hotels that I have been to!) but neat and well kept. The view from the room was not much but luckily, did not overlook the road.The breakfast that was included with the room was basic with the option to buy a larger selection.

<Content>pretty good but a bit noisy the staff were friendly, the lift big enough for 2 of us plus a very large case and the room small but perfectly reasonable, and bed clean and comfortable. that said, we were on the 2nd floor at the front of the building, and delighted to find we had a small balcony - until we stepped out onto it - the noise! constant traffic and the metro rumbling away not far below us every few minutes until about 1 in the morning. luckily it wasn't high summer, as it was we had a choice of sleeping with the balcony door shut, and being a bit warm, or opening it and not being able to sleep for the noise. also the waterpipes for what seemed like the whole hotel ran through our bathroom, and gurgled and gushed most of the night. however with the balcony door closed and the bathroom door closed, if a little stifled, we managed to avoid a fair amount of the noise. the walls were also thin, as we discovered when the people in the room next door came back late and argued!. however we did have a budget price offer, we live near a main road normally, and I assume if you got a room higher up in the 7 storey building, or at the back then you would be better off. the bed was excellent, the wardrobe space a bit limited, - a small wardrobe and a few small drawers, but the bathroom was clean, with complimentary shampoos and enough towels for two, the breakfast continued till late 10.30 or 11 the staff were friendly and chatty in english and kindly overlooked my attempts at french. breakfast was continental - cafe au lait or black coffee or tea seemed to be the only choices, plus cereal or fruit, brioches and jams and some assorted pain au chocolats and some meats and cheese - perfectly ok to start the daythough the metro's rumbling could be felt below us, it meant it was only a very short walk - come out of the front door and turn right, and the nearest metro was 2 minutes away, Rue Des Boulets - with an escalator up to the street, just opposite hotel on the way back - heavenly for tired feet- nearer than Nation. it was very convenient for getting about everywhere by metro, train and probably bus if you could figure them out! we bought a 5-day Paris Visites travel ticket which was huge value for getting around everywhere and hopping on and off metros all day, and gives you discounts. recommend the Musee Carnavalet, which is free, and fascinating history of Paris - like a huge junk shop of rich and poor people's furniture and pictures.there is a bar in the lobby and they issue you with a handy free street and metro/RER train and bus map, and the Figaro was a free read at breakfast, even the Guardian appeared on the rack one day!generally a comfortable stay, but if noise gets to you, try to make sure you have a room at the back of the hotel. if you're a city bod, it won't overly bother you, but it was a little trying. and a fridge and safe would have been useful - however we cooled the wine in the basin. if you're going budget then be prepared for some small shortcomings! recommend, but not quite as good as I thought it would be from other reviews - they were obviously luckier than we were.

<Content>Ideal base for visit to Paris Just stayed for the weekend to see the many attractions of Paris.The hotel is very smart and has a peaceful and comfortable reception/bar area.The rooms are small but tastefully decorated with en-suite bathrooms, very clean with a good service provided from the bar and reception personnel. Breakfast is given in the basement in a pleaseant dinning room 7 - 11am. One negative is that there are no coffee making facilties in the room.The hotel is a perfect base for couples wanting to explore Paris as it's just 7 mins from the station at Place du Nation, that has 2 metro lines and RER. Being in the 11er, the price is less expensive, but why pay more when you only use it as a base to sleep.

<Content>A good hotel in a good location We recently stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is in a great location about 10 minutes walk from an RER line which made the airport transfer easy. We checked in quite late at night which wasn't a problem with the English-speaking staff. The rooms are simple, but very clean and perfectly adequate. The bathroom was spotless. Our time in Paris coincided with some very hot weather, so the room and bathroom were quite stuffy, but bearable. We were on the 5th floor and there was street and Metro noise with the windows open, but again, it was bearable.The continental breakfast was great each morning and the hotel staff are all very friendly and helpful.The hotel has lots of restaurants, cafes/bar and shops close by and is very close to the Metro and the RER. The area seemed to be very safe and clean.We would definitely recommend this hotel to people looking for a clean, comfortable and good value tourist-class hotel in a good location. We'd stay there again.

<Content>A Pleasant Hotel This is a very respectable, well run and pleasant hotel. It is also very good value for a major city within the Euro zone. The staff were very friendly and helpful; be sure to ask for their restaurant recommendations.The rooms were very clean and comfortable although a bit small. They were also inclined to be stuffy and being in a large city leaving the window open was not compatible with a quiet night's sleep. Notwithstanding I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel.Nation is a quiet area of Paris a bit off the beaten track but the hotel is near two metro stations and only 2 stops on the RER from Chatelet (and the centre of town). It's also well on the way to Eurodisney.

<Content>Great value - good time. Friendly to English speakers My girlfriend and I had an excellent 2-night stay at the Grand Hotel this week. After seeing so many positive reviews here, we were skeptical that they may have been fakes posted by staff, but once we checked in, we were quickly relieved that this was a lovely hotel. The desk managers spoke English well and helped us get around and choose a great local restaurant, that was off the beaten path.The hotel is located very close (1 minute walk) to the train. Bd Voltaire is a main street with lots of cafes, restaurants, and local shops, which gear more toward the locals, as this isn't a major tourist area. We had a nice lunch for Eur 4.00 just down the street, for example. The downside to it being light on tourists is that when we arrived on Sunday, most restaurants/storefronts in the immediate area were closed. Still, the Bastille is only 10-15 minutes on foot, or 3 on the metro, with the opera and everything else. You will need to add time (15-30 minutes) to get to the key tourist destinations by metro. Our room was above the street, overlooking the corner. We could lean out the huge windows. The room was cozy but big enough for us. Our bathroom was clean and new. Our package included continental breakfast, which was very convenient and tasty.This was a very great value, and we'd gladly stay there again.

<Content>Great little hotel, fabulous staff! Just returned from a long weekend here. Firstly one of the nicest parts of our stay was the friendliness of the staff. The chap on reception (who I believe is Wally the owner) is a great chap. His English is excellent and he's one of the friendlest people that I have ever found in a hotel. He would always make an effort to say hello and goodbye each time you passed through reception. He seemed to appreciate the effort I made in trying to speak French but thankfully his english was much better than my french!The rooms are smaller than I would have hoped but I believe that this is pretty much the norm for Paris. Having said this however they are extremely clean and do have all the features that you'd need - desk, phone, TV, hairdryer (that actually does dry your hair unlike hairdryers in some hotels). The bathroom is small but has great water pressure - the shower is very powerful but the thing that lets it down is that it's a hand held shower - all it would need would be a wall bracket and a shower curtain and it would be perfect!We found the location to be pleasing. Okay so it is a bit out of the centre, however it is between two metro stations. We arrived in to CDG Airport and caught the RER B to Chatalet Les Halles, change to the RER A to Nation. Upon arrival at Nation station, you leave the station, cross the road to Boulevard Voltaire and the Grand Hotel Francais is around a five minute walk on the right hand side. Nation is one of the central stations that has 4 or 5 lines running through it so the hotel is perfectly suited to get to any of the main attractions via the metro. There is another metro station - Rue des Boulets which is closer to the hotel (literally 1 mins walk away), however only the no. 9 line runs to this one. With the hotel being away from the centre it is certainly cheaper with regards to food and drink than residing right in the heart of Paris and is only 20 mins or so away from the attractions via the metro (single metro ticket only 鈧?.40).So in summary, if you're looking for a friendly, economical hotel with clean basic features then this is the hotel for you. Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Great Value This hotel is very central for Paris visitors even though it is not in a tourist area per se. Lots of restaurants and supermarkets in the area for a quick bite or a sit-down. About 20 minutes from Place Bastille. 5 minutes from the Nation metro and train which then connects with all of Paris and beyond. Less than 1 hour and 8 euros from De Gaulle airport. A little over an hour and 2 Euros from Versailles. The hotel is not in the luxury class but a very good tourist class hotel.Very clean room, linen, bathroom. Staff always cheerful and ready to provide advice. Highly recommended! We would return here when we are in Paris again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel  I just returned from a 1 week vacation in Paris. I can't say enough about the hotel and it's staff. The rooms were very clean and were a decent size. The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful during our entire stay. I had emailed the hotel prior to arriving to confirm the reservation, I received a response almost immediately. The hotel was located near a Metro stop which made it easy to get anywhere in Paris you may wish to go. When I return to the beautiful city of Paris, I will definitely reserve a room at the Au Grand Hotel Francais!

<Content>Excellent, Friendly Service My new wife and I spent our honeymoon at this hotel. Although we had booked through Travelocity, I had inquired via e-mail to the management about staying in a room with a balcony. While we were not able to check in until 1:00, after arriving around 9:30, when we did check in, we were completely surprised to find that our room not only had a balcony, but probably the best balcony in the hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and always willing to answer any questions we had.While the location was not close in proximity to the major tourist attractions, it's location from Nation made it easy to get anywhere we wanted to go. We also liked the fact that we seemed to be the only Americans in the hotel, we felt that we were seeing parts of Paris that not all tourists see. All in all we would recommend this hotel to any and all who are travelling to Paris.

<Content>Average Hotel Like some other reviewers, my visit to this hotel left me with a feeling of indiference. There was nothing much wrong with it, it was just very average. The rooms are okay, just a bit small and bland. You can hear the metro running underneath the hotel at night, but its not a big problem. Don't underestimate how long it takes to get to the central tourist attractions from this location - you can easily lose 15mins on the Metro. The Bastile area is walkable (20 mins or so) which is a good area for more affordable bars and resturants. Overall - average, a little dissapointing, but okay.

They were very accommodating and made excellent recommendations on restaurants and nightlife activities. The breakfast area was cozy and a great place to interact with a blend of locals and other travelers. I met a lot of friendly people at this hotel and would strongly recommend it to anyone who's travelling from abroad.

Nation is not the most charming Paris neighboorhoods, and there really isn't much to attract me to the hotel in the future. I'm not saying it was bad, I'm just saying it was profoundly average.

<Content>Give the Au Gand Hotel Francais a try This is a value hotel in a convenient location. There are several very good restaurants nearby. Try the Chardenou - around 35 euros per personThe management of the reception and housekeeping isvery, very good and there is a good bar in the lobby. The staff is friendly and will endure your attempt to speak french. Good natured people!!!!If I were going to make an improvement on the hotel I wouldrecommend that every bath have a high shower and tub shield and that the hotel rotate to harder mattresses for all the rooms.The rooms are typical of Paris as to size.Nearby is the Place Nation and the Rue de Picpus which turned out to beinteresting with a relatively hidden historic cemetery where 1300 guillotined martyrs are buried after meeting their fate nearby in the years 1789-1793 ...about a 12 minute walk from the hotel towards Porte Doree.

<Content>You will never experience better service anywhere! I expected a pleasant stay and the hotel more than delivered. The manager was helpful, kind, pleasant, patient, and all of the previous posts about the good service are correct. I personally witnessed the manager give a guest 50 euros and tell her to pay him back later. (He didn't even make her sign for it or anything!) When I asked him to change our room (to a twin room with 2 beds because of an error I had made with the booking) he happily did so and even moved our luggage for us. Nation IS a little out of the way, and I did hear faint conversation from our neighbors in the other room but it certainly wasn't any louder than the snoring of my traveling companion (smile) but it is a less than 5 minute walk to Nation where you can catch any train going to the major tourist attractions. A short walk to 2 open air markets. Some VERY GOOD restaurants are right in the area. (I personally recommend La Dame Brune!)

<Content>The Grand is grand! Our room was very clean, bright and cozy and the hotel located within a few paces of the bus and metro stops, and within walking distance (20 minutes) of Place de la Bastille, where the off-and-on tour buses stop. But the best feature was the manager, Li Hocine, who elevated French hospitality to new heights. Perfectly bi-lingual, he was a wealth of information about Paris, France and the French, a model of patience with all our requests and questions, and incredibly generous with his time, as well as his euros! When we realised, upon arriving, that we lacked sufficient funds for the tour bus next day, and that the banks would be closed, he immediately pulled out his wallet and loaned us the sum! We would definitely stay there again, and we highly recommend this hotel to anyone eager to visit Paris in the happiest way!

<Content>Efficient, No frills  Decided at 1am one night to visit Paris for a couple of days, searched and booked 10hrs later through boookings, finding a room ready and just sufficient to sleep a family of 4 with 2 children under 5 a few hours later. Even though the initial request for extra bedding wasn't made very clearly we were accommodated and looked after properly. Should you be driving: Reasonably well located, near to the outer peripheral road (just watch out which exit you take from Place de Nation...). Parking at the park house Picpus recommended (10min walk away from hotel).

<Content>OUTSTANDING! We just returned from Paris this week. We arrived at the lovely Grand Hotel Francais very early on a bitterly cold Christmas morning, rather tired after a flight from Los Angeles. We were expecting to be told that check-in time was in the afternoon and that we would have to wait for five or six hours to gain entry to our room. But, no....this was Paris, not New York! We were met by a charming, smiling Frenchman with perfect English who welcomed us, registered us within seconds and sent us off to our toasty, spotless room on the 5th floor with complimentary maps of Paris and an invitation to go downstairs for the all-you-can-eat breakfast....which we did. The breakfast area was pristine and the food was excellent. (croissants, bread roll and various pastries, cheeses, fresh orange juice, coffee or tea, cornflakes and granola, a selection of meat rolls, etc.). Breakfast cost 10 Euros per person. We did try to find it cheaper outside the hotel but found that we got a lot more food for the price at the hotel. So, it wasn't worth walking around the city every morning in the cold just to try to save a Euro or two.The hotel is clean and modern, tastefully furnished, airy and bright. Although it is not perhaps the most centrally located hotel for the major tourist sights that is no problem whatsoever as it is within a five to ten minute walk of three Metro stops so one can get anywhere in central Paris within 20 minutes.Our thanks go to the wonderful, cheerful and friendly staff, every one of whom welcomed us with a smile and a bonjour every time we saw them. We had a super stay and will definitely return. OUTSTANDING VALUE AND OUTSTANDING SERVICE. Louis N.California

<Content>Awful Service We are currently staying at the hotel and the service has been awful. We arrived on Dec. 17th with no problem. The room is a little small, but it was expected. After our first day here my husband and I got sick (on the 18th) from eating some bad food and didn't have our hotel room cleaned for 2 days (19th and 20th). Last night (22nd) we got a call from the front desk saying that the maid felt our room was too messy to clean today because we had 2 bags of garbage and an empty pizza box on the floor, but there are no trashcans in our room! So we had been bagging up our garbage so the maid wouldn't have to pick through stuff, but that was too messy... FOR THE MAID! Isn't that her job? Today (23rd) we got a phone call from the front desk saying our room needed to be cleaned. Not only did the maid not knock on the door and ask us to clean the room, but we were sleeping! So we asked that the room not be cleaned today, like we had done before, and the woman said it was a rule that it be cleaned because we had been ill. This was 4 days after we had been sick. Our room has been cleaned twice since we had been ill and no one had an issue until today. So we got up, out of bed, and went out for a couple of hours. All I can say is the way the staff has treated us has made our stay less than enjoyable. The customer is not always right at this hotel and I would not stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Au Grand Hotel Francais Arrived in Paris on 10-24-04. First trip to France, despite what every one said about the French hating americans, We had a fabulous time and were treated better by the Parisians than we are back home in the good ol' USA. Our stay at AU GRAND HOTEL FRANCAIS was very nice. Great hotel with staff that will bend over backwards for you. They paid for postage and mailed my postcards for me. The rooms were clean, and we had a great view from the 6th floor. Seemed like alot of Brittish and Americans use this hotel. They speak english and will help you with your poor memory of high school French! Close to metro line 9 Rue Des Boulets, which provides easy access to all Paris attractions. I will reccomend this hotel and probably stay with them again.

<Content>Friendliest Hotel ANYWHERE! I stayed at the Grand Hotel Francais for a week in May, and had picked it because of on-line reviews. Have been travelling to Paris for thirty years, and this is the friendliest place I've stayed on any continent. It's not luxury, but clean and attractive. Really, really nice people. Lovely breakfast area, and though breakfast runs about $10, the selection is really quite good, with an assortment of cereals, breads, cheeses, and coldcuts. Other reviewers had noted the slight rumble from the subway that runs under the hotel. Really not a concern. The street makes more noise than the subway. Thanks Mr. Ziad, Madame Blondine, and the rest!

<Content>Great Hotel and Location The Grand Hotel Francais is a wonderful hotel in a great location. After reading some reviews on this site, I was a little concerned about the room size, but this proved unfounded - our room was perfect! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the delicious breakfast is a perfect start for a day exploring Paris. The hotel is not right in the centre of the city but we found this to be a major plus point. The traffic isn't as heavy/noisy, and the prices for food and drink are a lot more reasonable. The Nation Metro station is only a 5 min walk away and Line 1 will take you from Nation to almost all of the major Parisian sights. If, like us, you are travelling with Ryanair, take the Metro from Port Maillot (yellow Line 1) to Nation, look for the BNP Bank - which is on the corner of the Boulevard Voltaire. The hotel is only a couple of minutes walk down the street on the right hand side.

The rooms are european size, specially in Paris where space is at a premium, but the smallness of the rooms is greatly compensated by the kindness and friendliness of the staff. The subway entrace in Rue des Bolets is few steps from the hotel. The location is very nice and safe, and there are shops and supermarkets nearby. Across the street there is a kosher supermarket!.Me and my wife have made the Grand Hotel Francais our second home in Paris.

<Content>Ok hotel. This is a fair hotel. Room was clean, although small. Good breakfast actually. Very filling and the croissants were delicious. Only problem with my particular room was the smell from the bathroom. Pipe problem I think. Solved by opening the large window in the bathroom and closing the door btwn the bathroom and the room. Probably a specific room problem.Other issue is the location: nice, quiet neighborhood. A bit out of the way from the tourist areas. could be a + or -. Near the subway but still ... I would prefer to stay in a more central area next time.

While the roms are charming, one of the best things about it is the staff - they seem to work 24/7, are wonderfullly helpful, multilingual, and a pleasure to be around. We will always come back to this hotel.

<Content>Friendly staff, great value Just returned from a weekend at the Grand Hotel Francais. I can only echo what has already been written. All the staff were so very friendly and polite, most unusual- I even had to question whether I was in Paris! But if you ache for that famous French arrogance and abruptness fret not- just visit the Monceau florist down the road!The rooms at the hotel are very good value- but at 10鈧?each, the breakfast certainly isn't (even if it is all you can eat). Our advice is to avoid the hotel's offerings and pick up a fantastic pan au chocolat from the patisserie across the street.Enjoy your time in Paris!

<Content>Happy to return to We stayed there from the 16th of April and found it to be a great hotel to stay in, its warm very clean with friendly staff from the cleaners, breakfast waitress and the front desk. As other reviewers have said the rooms are small (well they are not for living in) but the bed was very comfortable, especially after walking a marathon around the Paris sites every day. My only gripe was the shower, as it does not plug into a wall mount and with no curtain it is a skill to shower just oneself and not the entire bathroom. One does notice the hum of the local metro passing below because of its novelty but it is not a distraction and is quieter than the cars on the road. If like us you are travelling from Ireland to Beauvais Airport with Ryanair the Metro Ligne 1 travels from Port Neuilly directly to Nation, just 5 minutes walk away from the hotel. ADVISE buy bottles of water from the shop facing the hotel it is extremely cheaper(E0.18 for 2lts). 500ml bottles around the attractions costs around E3.00

<Content>Small but perfectly Formed A lovely friendly hotel. All the staff were a delight. Our room is probably best decribed as compact with no spare space, and although we were next to the lift, we were never disturbed by it. Le petit d茅jeuner is basic, but fresh and filling. The location is terrific - although the Rue des Boulets M茅tro is the nearest, we used the speedy RER from Nation to get into the City Centre. There are handy wine stores and shops, and they are many restaurants along Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine leading to Place de la Bastille. And for those on the budget, the best views of Paris are from the roof-top caf茅 of the department store, Samaritaine, on the right bank of Pont Neuf.

<Content>Good, friendly hotel Pleased with the hotel - rooms are small but very clean and well equipped apart from not having a mirror above the dressing table! We had a corner room which is superior and had 3 windows - the neon hotel sign at night was a but intrusive although the curtains were quite thick and subdued the effect. Breakfast was plentiful and good. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times. Would recommend this hotel - metro links were good and the Nation area is pleasant. A nice, little retaurant nearby is Le Petit Caillou - the couscous is good and inexpensive at 8 euros. Don't use the hotel shuttle bus for travelling from the Gare du Nord - 30 euros for a 5/10 minute journey was rather expensive. All in all, though, a good time was had.

<Content>Just returned with the latest information Just returned March 23, 2004. Overview: This hotel is clean, friendly and in a good neighborhood, and the photo's on thier web site are accurate. It is a short walk to the Metro lines 1-2-6- 9  RER. Guests of the hotel were from the USA, Britan, Germany. Ranged from ages of mid 20's to late 60's and all couples or families. No loud drunks, or uncomfortable situations permitted in this hotel. So if your planning on a girls gone wild spring break, I would tell you to look for a hotel in the Latin Quarter. The hotel staff: Incredibly helpful and every desk clerk spoke english, which is more than I can say regarding ability to speak French. Checking in and out was smooth with no surprises. Rooms: Small if you have never traveled to Europe, but larger than what I have stayed in in Rome or London. Quite with the windows closed, but I imagine that in the summer or warmer weather street noise may bother some people. There is no AC yet, but plans to have it installed are in the works for 2005. Rooms are cleaned each day, and we had no need to hide valuables. If you pack like your staying away for a month for a weeks vacation you will have little options as to where to place your belongings. There is TV, but if your concerned about TV I question your motive for travel to Paris. Beds were comfortable. Ask for a room that would be considered front corner, faces street. You will have 3 windows vs. 1 or 2. Safety: We walked, jogged and rode the metro at all hours. We never had a problem. The hotel is locked down every night and nobody gets in that does not belong. As in any big city the area has a few panhandlers. I found street people to be non-aggressive and I can count on one hand how many times I was approached in the Nation area. I had far more encounters with panhandlers and con-artists in central Paris, mostly in the tourist areas. Resturnats: Plenty of local neigborhood cafe's, restruants, sandwich shops, bakery's, and shopping at reasonable prices. In fact, we did much of our gift shopping in Nation and saved money vs. shopping in central Paris or tourist areas. We did not have a bad meal. There are several in the neighborhood we did not get to. But you can eat some great French food and not pay central Paris prices. Bars and Partying: If you want this activity, walk or metro a short distance to Place de Bastile. Note: Learn some French before you go. Many people are helpful, but since this is not a tourist area and many of the people speak French and very little English. But you are in France. We shopped and ate often in the neighborhood and always had a plesant time. In fact, I think the people in the Nation area went out of thier way to really try to be helpful.

<Content>Au Grand francais -Only Ok We stayed at Au Grand Francais - its location is good - near 2 metros and in a relatively quiet area -only noise was from the Metro after 6am..but thankfully no noises from amorous neighbours!!Concerieges are very friendly -perhaps too much so - I was left with the impression of being watched continually by them - perhaps iots just me but sometimes its becomes too much...!The room was TINY and the big downer was that the shower was only attached to the bath taps there was no hole in the wall to hang it up...great advert for a shower for 2 !! but othertimes a little annoying.Rooms were made up each day .Watch out for final bill - the hotel adds city tax at Euro 1 per person per day which IS advertised but also adds a Sales Tax which IS NOT ADVERTISED. Its not much but they fail to mentiion it anywhere

<Content>Grand Hotel Francais is an Outstanding Value Located in an active, working Paris neighborhood, the Grand Hotel Francais is well-maintained and offers small but well-kept rooms in a classic building that offers great access to all of Paris from the Place de la Nation metro/RER hub. Wally and his staff are friendly, attentive and speak excellent English. Because it is outside of the tourist zone, you will find many great places to eat that are less expensive. This is safe neighborhood that is filled with boulangeries, pastry shops, brasseries, grocery stores and everything else to take care of visitors' needs. Best of all, it won't cost you an arm and a leg because the Grand Hotel Francais has very competitive rates for the quality of the property. We highly recommend it and we have returned often since discovering this little gem several years ago.

<Content>Superb value for the dollar I rented a room with a double bed and bath. While the room was smaller than anything you'd find in the States, the overall value you get for your dollar is without dispute.Taking a chance booking a room over the Internet at this hotel, I can tell you I was more than a little apprehensive of what I would find upon my arrival. So imagine my relief at finding extremely polite and helpful staff, as well as an impeccably clean, functional room. The continental breakfast they also served in the mornings was perfect to start your exploration of the city each morning.The distance this hotel is from the main attractions in Paris is so insignificant, especially when you consider the dollar savings. The Bastille is MAYBE a 10-minute walk at most. Also Metro #9 (Rue des Boulets) stop is within 50 feet of the hotel s entrance, and the Nation station (connects to almost all other major lines) is about 3 blocks (less than 3 minute walk) from the hotel's entrance.As a single, young woman traveling alone in Paris, I couldn't have chosen a better place that immediately put my accommodation concerns to rest.

<Content>Bargain Gem This is a perfect example of a small Parisian hotel that balances the friendliness and intimacy of a family-run place with the professionalism of larger, more expensive hotels. The rooms, if a bit small and spartan, are nonetheless immaculately clean and new, and the bathrooms are pristine. A standard but good-quality breakfast is served in a very cheerful, well-lit room. The neighborhood is excellent--not a tourist district, but rather a real residential quarter convenient to the Metro. But the staff is what will really inspire me to return. The breakfast staff, the chambermaids, and the desk staff were all pleasant and extremely helpful. And the manager, Si Zyad, was tremendously energetic and accommodating, whether recommending restaurants in the neighborhood or looking up obscure museums on the web. When our return flight to the US was cancelled, Si offered us an extra night at the hotel at a discounted rate and spent much of his own time calling the airline (Air India in Paris is not always easy to contact) and checking the airline's website to keep track of our flight. All in all, we were very pleased and will certainly return again.

<Content>Bad Services The room was small and noisy, furniture old, but the worst thing was the very unfriendly manager at check out.He seems enjoying telling offensive jokes like So... you wanna kill me !en? hahha! Terrible! There are a lot of better hotels in the price range around, so avoid to go to this one.

<Content>perfect for us Stayed at the Grand Hotel Francais for 3 nights. It's a great location, definitely away from tourist-ey places, but we like staying amongst the natives, so it was perfect. The Metro station was just a nice, short walk away, and you can get everywhere using the subway. Several tasty restaurants nearby, particularly the Italian place just a few doors down, and the Nation offers several good places. Be sure to try the creme broulee at a place called Le Propers or Prosper Cafe or something like that, it was fantastic. It was recommended by the desk staff and they were right! But, don't ever order Andouiettes, it's very nasty stuff, unless you are into tripe. The hotel room was pretty small, but the bathroom was big by comparison to other places we've stayed, and, hey, it's Paris! If you spend a lot of time in your room you are missing the point. Great service, both by the day clerk Si and by the night clerk who's name we didn't get. Both were very helpful and cordial. they spoke a little English, we spoke a little French, it was great. Please, do all of us American travellers a favor, learn some of the local lingo and customs. For example, greet all shop owner: say hello and thank you-good bye when entering and leaving any place of business. It will go a long way. I would recommend skipping the breakfast at the hotel and hitting a local Patiseree, there are several in the area. We would deffinately recommend staying at the Grand Hotel Francais, as long as you don't require too much pampering.

<Content>Excellent Value Stayed here 6 nights in October 2003 based on many positive reviews from this site and booked at a discount over the internet. Had a basic room which was small, but clean and fairly modern. Management was friendly, helpful and spoke excellent English. We enjoyed being in a neighborhood that catered more to Parisians than tourists. There were great restaurants and patisseries nearby and the Metro is about 70 steps from the front door. The Avis outlet that we booked through for driving to the Loire Valley turned out to be conveniently on the same block.The negatives? Good windows minimized traffic noise (we were also near the back) but the walls are thin and if you have noisy neighbors, it could be a problem. Also, I was surprised that none of the previous reviews mentioned the fact that the hotel sits directly over the Metro line. From about 5am until midnight, there's a subtle rumble that sounds like distance thunder about every 5 minutes. It wasn't as bad as it sounds (kinda cool actually) and didn't affect our sleep at all, but it's there. Finally, our tub had a sprayer and no curtain, which was somewhat inconvenient, but not a real problem.For the price, we found this to be an excellent hotel and would recommend it to anyone. We were perhaps 10 minutes farther by Metro from the sites than hotels on the Left Bank, but thought the quiet, authentic neighborhood and the relatively modern hotel more than made up for it.

<Content>We recommend the Grand Hotel Francais We've just spent three nights at Le Grand Hotel Francais. The room was small but clean and perfectly well equipped for a short stay. We were lucky enough to be given a room that had three French windows and a long balcony from which we had a leafy view down a typically Parisien boulevard. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. The Grand Hotel location is good; although it isn't in a smart area of Paris it is in-between two useful metro stations, both of which were onlyminutes' walk away. Breakfast was fine and there was plenty of it. The Grand Hotel is good value and we would happily recommend it.

<Content>That's our TERRIBLE stay in Paris!We were Being kicked out very rudely! I am from China. On July 31,2003 , After Checked in this Hotel for 20 miniutes , We Were KICKED OUT very RUDEly by the owner of the hotel. We have complained to the Tourist Office in Paris but get no replys until now.AND WHY?!!Here's the whole story:We also found this hotel by Internet . On July 31, We three, including my GF, were travelling in Paris. So when we arrived in Paris, We first Made a phonecall to it ,ask for a room for three person. And the Reception told us, there were only double room and single room available.But my friend thought the price of single room is too high for him.He wanted to find a cheaper one. So When we got to the Hotel,We only opened one double room for my GF and me .And my friend wanted to find another Cheaper hotel or YOUTH hotel.After about staying in the room for about 20 minutes from about 7:00 to 7:20,When we three got downstairs,the Owner of the hotel shouted at us.He shouted:Get out my hotel , you Three people want to stay in one Double room! He judged us by our 20minutes' stay in the Hotel. And he gave no chance to us to say anything. He kept shouting.You can't image how Rude he is.He also threatened us, he said  I am a good fighter , you want to try!!'.....That's a terrible day in Paris!!I've read some good reviews about this hotel in Tripadvisor.If those are true , I can't understand why the same person can Act so different! the only reason I can conclude is that he is racialism!

<Content>Be cautious I'm French and I've been in living in Paris for 5 years. Just to check if the hotels ratings were relevant or not on this web site, I had a look at the hotels for Paris. I first was attracted by the name of this hotel which does not sound really French but rather like a tourist trap. Then reading at the description I've found than the time estimation from Nation to anywhere else was under-estimated (indeed 5mn from Nation to Bastille with the 'Metro' but 20 minutes by foot). Also please note that Nation is certainely not 10 minutes from any place of the Paris tourism's since Nation is located in east of Paris and most interesting places are located in the centre or West. What is true is that from Nation you can go almost every where thanks to its four lines of Metro. Maybe this hotel is actually a nice place to stay but they are not totally honest in its description. And most of the reviews of it are suspicious.
