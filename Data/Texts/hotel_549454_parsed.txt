<Content>Modern hotel close to metro station Location-wise I think this hotel is very conveniently located with a metro station just a few steps away. The Sagrada Familia is totally within walking distance (about 15 mins); alternatively it is only one station away if you take the metro. Also, it is a 10-minute taxi ride from Nord bus station which is where you take airport coaches to and from Girona Airport (the Ryan Air airport). The downside is that it is at an intersection of two busy roads so you might have to bear with the noise of the buzzling traffic. The room was fairly modern, but the desks looked pretty dusty (might have something to do with the hotel being situated at the intersection of main roads), and water kept leaking from underneath the sink in our room whenever I turn on the tap. There is also no kettle in the room and it took ages for the hotel staff to bring us hot water. There was free wi-fi in the room but the connection was pretty unstable. If you really need to use the internet, the hotel has a computer down at the lobby.There is obviously room for improvement to keep up to its 4 star rating but service aside if all you need is a modern hotel with a good location, then this is a hotel I would recommend.

<Content>Not a 4 star hotel by UK standards A contemporary hotel in a good location (Monumental metro literally a 100 yards away), Sagrada Familia 10 minutes walk away. We spent 3 days exploring this great city and didn't spend a great deal of time at the hotel. I have to say that it's not safe to assume that a 4-star hotel will have similar facilities to a typical 4-star hotel in the UK. There were a number of negatives about the hotel that didn't ruin our break, but certainly compelled me to inform others who thinking of booking a stay here.Negatives:* Lack of hotel facilities - an excuse for a bar in the reception area.* Single beds pushed together to make a double - apparently only 4 rooms in the hotel have double beds, make sure you double check if you are getting a double bed in advance* Beds are the firmest I've ever slept on - fine if you like them that way but very hard.* First time I've ever come across this in any hotel but twice around midnight, we came back to the hotel only to find a sign in the window stating 'back in 5 minutes' and the doors locked! We never felt unsafe in the area but a single female traveller might not take too kindly to having to hang around outside the hotel at that hour....* One single toiletry item - shower gel, typical theme in the hotel, a feeling of a lack of facilities.* The biggest issue for me was the fact that the hotel only offer an ironing service and do not provide an iron and iron board to the room. This took us by surprise and if we'd had all the clothes ironed we brought with us, it would have cost over 100 Euros. Perhaps this is a typical policy in Spanish hotels (I've had a similar thing in Athens) but it's a warning for those on a longer break that there is a risk of significant additional costs.* Staff were miserable and we felt like an inconvenience to them at times. A complaint about the twin beds was met with a shake of the shoulders and upon checking out, the receptionist didn't ask if we'd had a nice stay or even said thank you or goodbye - not a big issue, but evidence of a lack of good management and customer care.There is no way this is a 4 star hotel, yes the rooms are nicely furnished, but the sheer lack of facilities made it a three star at best with a BB feel.I would rarely stay at the same hotel twice as it is, but there is absolutely no way I would stay at this place again. I'm sure there are much better bases from which to explore this wonderful city from.

<Content>Eurostar Gaudi Dec. 2007 We stayed here for three nights beginning Dec.2nd. following a nine day cruise. We took a taxi that had room for four and cruise luggage. The taxis charge by the piece and for a larger minivan. We paid about 30 Euros with tip. While checking in, a member of our party had two carryons stolen by thieves in the lobby at around 9am in the morning. The girl at the desk let two men in the lobby while we were checking in. These men were not guests of the hotel and casually walked in, hung around the area and casually walked out with the carryon luggage before our friend knew what happened. I was involved with checking in and providing passports along with my friend. His wife went to the bathroom and our other friends were looking at the lobby internet and reading maps so stay vigilant even in the small lobby of a small hotel. The rooms were clean and modern and we had a good view of the circle and the towers of Segrada Familia a few blocks away. There is shower gel, soap, but no shampoo. They have fancy showers but only half partition of glass so flooding is common. The drainage is very slow. The towels smell like vinegar. The flat screen worked but not too many offerings in English. There are no good places to eat around the hotel. We don't like the cafe bars. The food is horrible and expensive. The good restaurants are down toward the Port and La Ramblas. The restaurants and cafes are smoke filled so those allergic, don't go to Barcelona. It seems like most people smoke. We saw many young teenagers smoking like chimneys. We used a two day hop on hop off bus at $23 Euros per person and caught it at the Segrada Familia. The metro was really close by the hotel- Monument station was less than a block away, 1.5 Euros each way. The Segrada Familia station was near the tourist site about 4 blocks away. Food is expensive, look for menu of the day offerings for value. Our US dollars don't go far in Europe.We enjoyed the Gothic Quarter and Park Guell. We visited some of the other stops and shopped in local districts on the tour bus route. We noticed that the general population and the non-tourist trade shop keepers have different hours from Americans. We get the impression that they don't work many hours a day. There is plenty to see and it will take more than three days to see many of the main sites. We paid 40 Euros for a taxi to the airport for 4 with 8 pieces of luggage. Other than the robbery, our friends enjoyed the Egyptian museum and Picasso Museum. It was an experience-good and bad.

<Content>Nice and clean, minor issues This shouldn't be taken for the Gaudi Hotel from La Rambla (which I don't know, just that they are different). Eurostars' Gaudi is 10 minutes walk from Sagrada. If you're lucky you'll view it's roof from the hotel's window. Sagrada is close, but this is not downtown nor the gothic quarter (which is a little bit dirty imo). This is not a central hotel, but it's a quiet neigborhood (for a city).If you want the best of this hotel, ask for one of the rooms with terrace (last floor). They should be much nicer than the rest and bigger (especially if you've seen their website). We stayed in the smallest room, the one near elevators. Those are smaller than the regular ones, but we were OK, it was just a weekend trip.However, if you stay longer, get away from the elevators. The doors are indeed paper sheet, you will be woke up by your neighbors, not by the clock or sun ;) Didn't hear much of the noise on the street, but heard every foot step on the hallway.The hotel is 1 min from the subway station. Very very handy. One issue I noticed is that you will have to switch trains at least once from here, no matter where you head to. Didn't bother me a lot, but worths mentioning.Hotel is clean, furniture was new. A little bit cheap, trying to imitate expensive furniture. It is not... Anyway, better to imitate nice furniture than to have expensive ugly furniture.Didn't have anything to ask to staff so I can't comment. TV stations are not working well, but who needs that in Barcelona? Breakfast is enjoyable here (would be nicer with a view, but the hotel is very small) and there are so many things to do out there. Tip: Definitely go to Barceloneta if you like seafood. Choose any of the 100 fish restaurants there.

<Content>Good hotel, good location The hotel was new and clean. The room was large and had all the mod cons for a 4 start hotel. The staff was helpful and assisted where possible with my friend who was ill. Free internet. The location was also good - 5 minutes from the Sagrada Familia and about a 15-20min minute walk to the Placa Catalunya or else you can get the bus (5mins  1.25euros) or a taxi for about 4euros. The only downside is that there isn't alot of eateries around the hotel. Definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Romantic Weekend Spoiled Overall a hotel with very nice rooms. However, not acceptable as a 4 star hotel (this is what you pay at the end of the day)Rooms- very nice and clean- TV was not working- Minibar was not refilled- soap, shower gel and body lotion was not refilled. Again, if one goes into a 4 star hotel one should not have to buy hygienic accessories in the supermarket next doorBreakfast: - unfortunately only 2 kinds of sausages, 2 different cheeses- no eggs- no coffee and no tee at 10:30 a.m (although we were told, breakfast is until 11 a.m.) This was clearly not acceptable for a 4 Star hotel. Also, we paid 12 euro per person for this meal.Service- we have complained but were not given any feedback- some reception staff (not all !!) were really rudeAgain, very nice rooms (size, look etc.) but everything else in our opinion is not even 3 star, i.e. you don't get what you pay for.

<Content>Nice clean hotel We stayed at this hotel in September 2006 and really enjoyed it. We had a great view of the Sagrada Familia from our bedroom window. The room was large, clean and modern with very effective air conditioning. There is a metro stop right next to the hotel which makes it very easy to get around. Alternatively, a taxi from the main tourist areas at night is inexpensive and easy to get. It is a modern clean hotel and while it is not right in the centre of the tourist area, it is easily accessible.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Seven of us stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August. It is a small but lovely boutique hotel which is very modern and clean and the staff are so helpful and pleasant. It is close to the metro station which allows travel around Barcelona and its attractions although the hotel is in walking distance of the Sagrad Familia (which can be seen from the hotel) the beach and the marina. On the last day we were not due to leave Barcelona until 1800 hrs and were able to pay 30 euros to keep a room on until 1700 hrs and were provided with clean towels for everyone. Would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Very impressed! This was a lovely hotel - room was lovely and clean and had good soundproofing considering its on the corner of some busy roads!! Its not far from Sagrada Famailia and we could see it from our room. The bathroom was lovely with an amazing power shower. I can not fault this hotel at all. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that although maybe a little expensive at 12 euros! Its also very close to the Metro although we didn't use it. We did walk from La Ramblas and it took about 20 minutes. On the other hand we didn't particularly like Barcelona it was very expensive and also way too crowded but i guess the time of year didn't help. If you like busy busy busy and queuing then this is the place for you! We were so glad we chose this great hotel to come back too at the end of the day!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel A truly excellent hotel experience. Within walking distance of Sagrada Familia, right next to the Monumental Metro station. Room was clean, not big, but very classy with a wall-mounted plasma TV and mural featuring one of Gaudi's buildings. The shower had multiple spray jets and a full marble bathroom. There is free internet in the lobby. Staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful with directions, mailing postcards, etc. Room was quiet and had a great view of the Gran Via and Cathedral. Definitely a great choice for a stay in Barcelona.

<Content>best hotel ive ever stayed in This hotel is by far the best one in which i've ever had the pleasure of staying. The rooms are very modern and clean, service is outstanding and the views from many of the rooms are breathtaking. It's also in a extremely convenient location, next to the underground entrance, and so is a perfect hotel for those who wish to see the sights of this wonderful city without staying in the busy, and often noisy centre. I'd recommend this to anyone- fantastic.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I wanted a quiet hotel that was modern and clean, and this hotel was just perfect. Everything looked very designer and new, the rooms were not massive but the bathroom was every thing you could wish for all marble and stylish.We booked with breakfast which I would recommend as they had a wide choice of buffet style food, from rolls,cold meats, to bacon, egg and sausage! The staff were all very helpful too, so full marks.The hotel is only a short walk from the Sagrada Familia Cathedral, and right next to Monumental Metro station on line2, just 2 stops from the central Placa de Catalunya. Buy a 10 trips ticket at the easy to use automatic machines and wonder at how cheap it is to travel there.By the way , we found the Airport Bus from directly outside the arrivals hall to be fantastic value! just 3euros75 each to the center of town which takes 20mins and runs every 10mins!! Why can't we do this kind of service in England at an affordable price?We enjoyed Barcelona and the Hotel was great.

<Content>Great location, facilities and room In terms of quality against price this is an excellent hotel. I paid Euro 90 for a Sunday night and Euro 130 for a Monday and got great value out of it.First the location: 1 min to underground station, and just 4 stops or 15 - 20 mins to the Barcelona Cathedral. Also walking distance to Sagrada Familia.It got all the (mainly communication) facilities I need - free wireless internet with smooth connection, a safe that accommodates the laptop, and a flat TV. The room is comfy in earth tone and clean modern layout. Reception warm and helpful. The Eurostars Gaudi is up to standard with hotels in major cities in Europe and the States I statyed at when I was travelling on business that costed Euro 250 - 300. If there are any faults at all it might be the hardwood floor in the room which mean you need to move about carefully to avoiding making huge noises, you might also hear foot steps from floor above you. And the door isn't very sound-proof so you hear people talking on the corridor and if they bang their doors you get it loud and clear. But neither points bother me for I am a sound sleeper.

<Content>Very clean and quiet. If you are looking for a peaceful and safe area of Barcelona to stay in, this is the hotel for you. The rooms were great and we even had a view of the Sagrada Familia. I agree--skip the breakfast. Otherwise, this hotel is a great choice for your stay.

<Content>Would love to go back Have literally come back today from staying at this hotel, spent 5 days Monday to Saturday  I can honestly say that I cannot fault the hotel, yes it may be a little out of the centre but you can use the metro, 30 seconds walk away to the stop, Line 2 Monumental. We soon got the hang of the lines  thought it was brillant value to buy the T10 ticket which gives you 10 rides, as long as you dont go above ground then its 1 trip no matter how many times you change! I dont think that 5 days was enough, would go back tomorrow! word of warning, be very careful about buying drinks from restaurants along the rambles, we bought a pizza  an omlette that came to 13 euros but our 2 drinks came to another 25 on their own, the prices for them were not displayed which was annoying as we paid 4 euros for a bottle of wine at a chinese restaurant next to the hotel  13 for 1/2 of 1 there!!
