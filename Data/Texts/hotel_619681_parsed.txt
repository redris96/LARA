<Content>Great value for low price! First time in Barcelona and wanted to be close to city center. Location is great (10 minutes walk to La Rambla and to the main tourist Information Center where also all Tour Buses start).Hotel is great for a Romantic getaway and if you like some stuff to play around with in the room. You have a few buttons next to your bed that let you choose between hot/cold/normal lightning. Also the bathroom is very special as between the shower and the bedroom there is only a glass wall. In the glass there is a curtain though that can be closed electronically.Other pros: The Hotel was very clean, safe was for free, nice Flatscreen TV.Negative things: Only two English TV stations, doors and walls are not too thick so it can happen you wake up once in a while at night, The swimming pool on the roof could be amazing because it includes a whirlpool but in the winter it's not heated so you can't use it..Overall a great experience especially for young couples.Cheers

<Content>Another great stay at the Soho Stayed here before for one night while transiting, and loved it - so booked in for 4 nights this time when coming to Barcelona for a short city break. They didn't disappoint. The hotel decor is excellent, service friendly, breakfast tasty (although, in common with all hotels, probably a bit too pricey) and bed comfy. What more could you ask for? Definitely my first choice next time we're in town.

<Content>deserve 5 stars While I have stayed a lot of 5 star hotels in the world, I would like to emphasize that this hotel deserves 5 stars not only the clean and very modern room, but also great location, great service( especially the Italian gentleman at the front desk), and great breakfast! When we needed any help, they were so friendly and helpful that I could find anything! It was my first time in Barcelona, but the trip have become one of the best trip that I have ever had. In addition, I plan to go back to Barcelona early next year and of course, I will go back to this hotel! I highly recommend this hotel if you like modern hotels.

<Content>nice stay We staid at the Soho for one night. Booked via internet. The price/rate was excellent (135鈧?for a deluxe dble room). Room was cosy and confortable. Even though small details not perfect. Nice to have Wireless free connection. Avoid tips from staff as it came out she gave us a totally touristic and overpriced adress (to wich we did not go hopefully but only walked by;).It seems they were working on reduced staff team. Avoid parking under hotel (overpriced 21鈧?night).

<Content>Loved the roof terrace! I'd read reviews that said some rooms facing the road can be noisy so when I booked via the hotel's website I requested a quiet room if possible. I was very pleased that they were able to fulfill this request and give us a room at the side of the hotel, we heard no noise at all while we were there.The room design is very funky and cool, we had great fun trying out the different lighting effects within the first 5 mins of arriving in the room! It is a bit annoying that none of the bathroom doors shut completely, but not a major issue.Without a doubt the highlight of the hotel is the rooftop terrace - even on a freezing November day/evening! I can only imagine how nice the pool would be in the summer but we were happy to just sit up there and watch the sun set over Barcelona with a beer.Breakfast is good, and the free internet is a real bonus. We didn't see many bars/restaurants near the hotel which was a shame (but maybe we weren't looking in the right places!); instead we just headed to the Barri Gotic to eat and drink. Overall I enjoyed my stay in the hotel, it's in a good location for getting to the sights- about 10 mins walk to La Rambla, and there is also a metro stop right outside the hotel.

<Content>A good stay at the Soho we stayed at the Soho Hotel on the 1st and 2nd of December and found the hotel confortable and in a very good location however as other reviewers have suggested it is not very functional---overall style over substance.The lighting was poor and there were lots of dark corners,which some people would see as cool.The buffet breakfast was very good and the reception staff were wonderful. They reccomended two very good restaurants for us.The best restaurant for us was La Cervecerla Catalana on a street called Mallorca which is walkable from the hotel.

<Content>Design and a Sign I stayed two nights at the hotel in November 2008. Was glad that I booked one of the large balcony rooms (74) and was even more impressed by the wonderful metal and wood SOHO sign on the terrace ledge.The room itself was very well organised, with an excellent working/living space and a comfortable bed. Different lighting combinations could be set to make the room look warmer or cooler.Breakfast was included in the price and it was very attractively presented in a funky environment.Street noise was slightly annoying but this is to be expected on the Gran Via.I would definitely consider coming back to stay at this hotel.

<Content>tasteful design but poor functionality We stayed for three nights. The design of the hotel is tasteful but the functionality of the room design is poor. The wardrobes are small, there are no drawers, bathroom doors do not close properly and its glass walls flood the room with light if turned on during the night. What is worse, however, is the noise. The extremely busy avenue is well heard inside the rooms that are far from sound proof. So, expect to hear cars, ambulances and police cars all through the night. Location is not too bad, if you consider taking the underground. The feeling is really of too much design to poor return in comfort.

<Content>Hotel Soho is THE BEST!! We recently spent 4 days (a precruise stay in Barcelona) at this wonderful funky hotel after reading the great reviews on Trip Advisor and finding almost all comments to be true. I cannot thank David Iturbi (at the Front Desk) enough for all the help he gave us. First, he recommended the Romantic Package which was a much better deal than the original regular room booking we had made online. It came with a complementary hearty buffet breakfast every morning, a bottle of Cava and Chocolates in our room , a delightful dinner around the corner at Iurantia with Wine AND an upgrade to a beautiful Terrace Room. David also helped us with making reservations for 18 of our fellow Cruise Critic folks who met for a precruise dinner the night before we sailed at a great local (non-touristy) restaurant, the Taverna cam Margarit. Would have been hard for us to do from the US since they didn't open until 9pm Barcelona time and didn't speak much English. All in all, a great time was had by all.We found all of the Front Desk staff to be most helpful with suggestions and directions. Hotel Soho cannot be beat for value and great ambience. WE WOULD DEFINITELY STAY THERE AGAIN!!!!

<Content>Decent hotel, good location but not prefect! Having stayed here for a long weekend earlier this month I found it to be of a general high standard with a few problems. The 'Pro's' for me were the all the high tech gadgets in each room and the contemporary and modern style of the hotel. I felt the service was good and the free access to the two computers with free internet was a welcome extra, I find most European hotels now charge for use of the internet!. The biggest 'con' for me was the constant traffic noise from the Gran via (a major road through the city) this eight lane highway is situated right outside the front lobby. I will assume that rooms situated at the back of the hotel are probably much quieter so I would try and request one. Having stayed on the front side of the hotel I found myself unable to get any sleep, perhaps people used to traffic noise would be ok but I'm used to living in the countryside!. Having no sleep was obviously going to be an issue with a day full of busy sightseeing, so I had to visit reception the following morning and after initially seeming to be a little uninterested the gentleman was very helpful and moved me to a quieter and larger room.I can't say there is much else to be 'wary of' staying here, perhaps a few more English channels would be nice, there seems to be a large proportion of German and French channels and BBC world can get a little boring at times!! It might have been nice to use the pool, but I guess it's normal procedure to close it doing the winter. Apart from this a gym and spa would be a nice bonus, but if you want a good base for sightseeing the location is ideal. I have attached three photos of the Hotel :Photo 1- Shows the stylish front of the building from the Gran via. Photo 2- Is a typical scene from just outside the front lobby of the busy Gran via.Photo 3- Is a typical standard double room at the hotel.

<Content>What a great stay! We were in Barcelona for the last 10 days of October 2008, staying at the Soho Hotel, which is one of the N煤帽ez i Navarro Hotels in Spain. The hotel's location was very good, near one of the universities and 2 of the major shopping areas - lots of action close by  I did not have too much trouble finding my way around (with a bit of help from the Concierges), even though it was my first time in the city, and I was on my own for a bit, as my partner was at a conference for a few days.The property is an approximately 50+ room boutique hotel, and to be honest, this being my first trip to Europe, and having worked in management for a large high-end hotel in Vancouver, BC (Canada), the Soho definitely surpassed my expectations! It is a very well taken care of property - extremely clean, beautiful, kind of funky, but still fairly minimalist (which we liked), and our room had some nice features and was quite spacious for what we booked. The rooftop terrace was also a perfect place to spend a couple hours in the afternoon when the weather allowed, reading a book or whatnot - good view of the city as well. The breakfast set-up was also very well done, set up in the restaurant from 7-11am, and included in our room charge. It was not just continental, but included some hot items as well as fruit, yogurt, cereal, pastry, etc. - very substantial (healthy  not-so healthy) and items were refilled in a timely manner.The service was outstanding, including the Housekeeping, but especially the Front Desk/Concierge service, in particular Alessio and Erica, who were very informative, patient, gracious and had some excellent recommendations of restaurants and events that really helped to make our trip! They also helped us procure tickets for a football game, and a flamenco show, both of which were a lot of fun. The only mildly negative item that I would say is that part-way through our stay, apparently a family with teenage offspring moved in next door, as we could hear their mother yelling at them quite clearly (luckily in English) a few nights in a row!  Overall I would completely recommend this hotel and their staff, and it should go without saying that my standards are quite high after having worked in the industry for several years. Thanks to the entire team for helping to make my first trip to Europe such an amazing experience!

<Content>great hotel We stayed three nights at the Soho Hotel and it is was great. The most expensive accom during our entire 6 week holiday, but it was worth it. I highly recommend you book through their website and get the complimentary breakfast deal. We did not eat again until 8pm the same day! Great hot and cold breakfast food to fill up on. The rooms were very nice, but the road noise (lots of sirens) could always be heard so not so sure of their rooms being soundproof? Anyway, we enjoyed our stay and we will be back one day.

<Content>Stylish Soho Deciding where to go on a city-trip can take some time - searching for a hotel that fits the bill usually takes even a little bit longer. We like contemporary looks - nice design-features and good quality - all at affordable prices - and that is what SOHO in Barcelona offers. They have worked with real qualitative materials in a creative way. The entrance is so subtle you easily walk past the front-door. Stairs going down, take you to the multi-media room, with easy chairs to relax, a small library and free internet - stairs going up, take you to the stylish lounge and breakfast area. The rooms have a couple of nice features like soft and hot light to adapt the atmosphere to your own state of mind, there is a glass see-through wall between the bath-tub an the bedroom - which can be blocked for privacy if wanted - and different sliding doors allow the space to be used in an efficient way. Design-features include the Artemide lamp-shades that can be swung in different directions, the nice Grohe taps in the bathroom and the don't disturb magnet to be stuck on the door when in need for some privacy. The rooftop swimming pool and relaxing-area allows you to forget you are actually staying just a short walk from the centre of this great city. So where are the drawbacks you wonder? Of course the neighbourhood is noisy - then again so is every big city. Apart from that there is nothing we can think of. Breakfast has something for everyone also offering some real Spanish delicacies. Finally the staff are also really helpful and bring a smile to your face. Glad to have stayed a week at SOHO and for sure happy to come again!

<Content>Wonderful ending to our vacation! We stayed at this hotel following a cruise. We found the hotel to be in a great location. Our guide informed us that it is located in one of the better parts of town, which was nice to hear when we were dropped off. We were within walking distance to La Rambla and the metro system, making it easy to visit many parts of town. Along your walk to the metro you will find many small pastry, eateries, and coffee shops. The hotel is modernistic in design and nicely updated. It was spacious and very comfortable. The staff was friendly, spoke English, and was helpful with restaurant suggestions, maps and general directions. There was a rooftop pool area that offered a nice place to relax and enjoy at the end of the day. When your vacation is over if you choose to take the taxi to the airport, it runs around 25 Euro and the front desk will be more than happy to have one waiting for you.

Soho was very modern, clean and the staff couldn't have been more friendly. Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>FABULOUS We booked a Romantic Package through the hotel for 2 nights in September, which included dinner for one night, breakfast, a bottle of cava and chocolates. We were not disappointed. The hotel is fantastic, the suite with balcony was amazing and overlooked a courtyard and backed onto apartments but it was the centre of Barcelona, so other comments about the bad view, we thought were unjustified. What did they expect, the hanging gardens of Babylon! It was actually nice to hear the children play in the afternoon and the locals carrying on with their normal day. The hotel was spotless, the staff were extremely welcoming, very helpful and always pleasant. Breakfast was extremely good and we tried everything and filled up for the days sight-seeing. Ramblas is within walking distance but we mostly chose to use the underground and the nearest station Urgell, is within a few yards of the Hotel. The 3 course dinner with wine at Lurantia was first class and well worth a visit. We would definately stay at the hotel again and would highly recommend it to friends and family. A huge thank you to the staff at the Soho for a very enjoyable stay.

<Content>Perfect stay in a perfect place My sister and I stayed at Hotel Soho last week..What a wonderful hotel..On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful man and even though we arrived before check-in time he was able to give us a room straight away...The room was so modern and had everything we needed for our 3 night stay. The staff were so helpful in recommending restaurants which were very reasonable and located nearby. The rooftop pool was fab, tho small but we didn't mind. Breakfast was delicious with alot of choice and was included in our stay which cost us 50 euros each per night...a steal! The hotel was centrally located, only 10 mins walk from Plaza Catalunya.Barcelona is such an amazing place, friendly people and lots to do and see.Bus Turistic is definitely to be recommended and there is great shopping too in the city without breaking the bank. We cannot wait to go back!!

<Content>Fantastic Modern Hotel with some great english lads We got back from our vacation on Saturday after a fabulous time in the hotel Soho! When we first arrived we were greeted by a beautifully modern reception, although the guy behind the desk looked a bit moody. After a smooth check in we went up to our room and were equally impressed with the design although felt the room could have been a little larger. We actually saw into one of the back rooms and they looked a little bigger so it would be a good idea to request one of those if you can.The rooftop pool was great, with really nice views over the city. That said it wasn't really a swimming pool, more of a slash pool - in fact we found that out the hard way when someone decided to jump in followed by his friend soaking the whole place, including my book, whilst we were sunbathing. He was part of a large group of guys staying there, at first they were quite noisy and we wondered if this would spoil the pool area. In fact it turned out that they were really nice guys (and a treat to look at) there on a stag party for a guy called Paul if I remember correctly...Good luck with the wedding Paul!!!Oh one last thing I almost forgot... the showers actually have a see through wall that at a push of a button can go opaque...quite a fun feature... pity we didn't get those guys to try it out with us!

<Content>A+++++ My friend and I stayed in the SOHO for about 4 days and we loved every minute. Breakfast was very good and filling enough to last through until late lunch or even dinner some days. View from roof top was beautiful, along with a very nice pool (to cold to get in). The lounge downstairs had two computer that had internet access. We were walking distance from Plaza Cataluna, maybe 2 blocks. Everyone at the reception desk were very helpful. When the manager was at the desk he seemed to be very cold, liked talking to the employees better. They had everything we needed and then some. The room we were in was very modern. Thank you for such a wonderful experience.

<Content>Something very valuable got lost on my hotel room ! When we got to the hotel we got a pleasant surprise. The hotel had a terrific situation, just in the center of everything. It took approx. 10 minutes to walk to Las Ramblas. It was great! The room was very modern and stylish, but a bit trixy with all the modern stuff. Some things were difficult to handle! I have had a bite plate for many years and I have had a special dentist for this. I have paid lots of hundreds of euors to get it fixed. One morning I put my bite plate in its litte box just on my night stand as I always do. We went out from the room and came back some hours later in the afternoon, when I got back I realised that my bite plate was gone with the box! The room was cleaned so we called the reception to ask wheter they had got something there but they hadn.t' The day after I spoke to the hotel receptionist... I was really sad because I knew that I now had to pay some more hundreds of euros to get a new bite plate from the same dentist. I haven't lost it! Someone else has I believe since it wasn't o麓n my night stand later on. The receptionist told me that the manager was on vacation for some weeks, but that she would call me when she came back to give me compensation for the thing that the hotel had lost!!! I wrote a mail to her and got an answer that they don't take responsobility for the things that are kept outside the locker! WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!! Should I put all the clothes and everything in the locker then?!!!! This was so cruel. For the inconvience she offered me one free hotel night next time I come to town. Oh [--]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What an OFFER! I live hundreds of miles away and will probably never get back and IF I go back sometime I will definitely not stay at this hotel that either 1. stole my bite plate. 2. threw it away because they thought it was trash! I think its terrible. Now my insurance company will pay approx 200 EUROS and I have to pay 150 EUROS for something that I haven't lost. For something that the hotel personnel did! I think it's rude. I will never go back and I cannot recommend this hotel because of this thing that happened!!!

<Content>Great stay at the Soho Stayed at the Soho for 3 nights and we loved it. Short walk from the Urgell/Gran Via stop on the Aerobus. We arrived just before 2pm  got into our room. We were on the 5th floor facing onto Gran Via, the room was plenty big enough with a large bed  trendy decor. Took a minute to work out the blinds but they are operated by buttons next to the bed. If you feel the need to shut the ones at the bathroom then this is the buttons next to the socket at the sink. You can also make the lights brighter by pressing the buttons again  there is a small spot at the desk- but no mirror. I saw into one of the inner rooms when it was being cleaned  I didnt think it looked that dark- not compared to the room we had in Florence last year, it had no light. Maybe the ones on the lower floors had less light,Kept meaning to time the walk down to Plaza Catalunya, say 15 minutes at tourist pace! Seemed less at night but that might have been the wine. There is noise from Gran Via, but it never bothered us. If you don't like traffic noise then don't come to a city. You would need to be a very light sleeper for it to keep you awake! I actually loved the fact that the city is still buzzing late into the night. The walk down Gran Via seemed very safe, well lit and wide streets. People's bad experiences had made me worry but I needn't have.Our first night we asked the guy on reception to recommend a restaurant which we went to but it was packed out, but it looked fab. Our 3 nights we ate on Rambla Catalunya  then on Ronda Universitat. All 3 meals were lovely  reasonably priced. We lunched a couple of times on Pasaig De Gracia at Tapa Tapa. Great spot for people watching. Our fav bar was on the corner of Gran Via  Rambla Catalunya.Out flight home was not until the evening so when we checked out the hotel kept our bags in a secure luggage room. As we were all walked out we took a taxi to the airport which was quick  comfortable  34 Euros (not sure how they word out the supplement for the luggage  the airport, neither wonder he wouldn't let us lift the bags) eek!!Other than that I can totally recommend the Soho if you like your hotels modern, the staff were friendly, the breakfast was good the room was comfortable  the area was good. I would also recommend you go to Barcelona, it's a beautiful city, anyone we came across was polite  friendly (only got tutted at once by the Aerobus driver). We did the 2 day Bus Turistic which was good. We just loved it! Go there!!

<Content>Great stay in Hotel SOHO Barcelona Me and my wife spent a beautiful stay in hotel SOHO in Barcelona! The hotel is modern, clean, original and in a really good position. It takes 10minutes walking to go to la Rambla, the area is verys safe and you can walk also in the night without any problem. There is also a metro station just 50 meters from the hotel!! All the personnel of the hotel is very kind, young and professional. They all speak fluent english and one is italian and speaking our own language he suggested us great restaurants and places to visit in the city. The rate was very good and with a special internet fare we had also breakfast included, which is generally very expensive in Barcelona hotels. The room was equipped with many technological things, wifi internet is free and there are also 2 computer to surf the web for free in the lobby. The last floor is the terrace wiith a small swimming pool and a place were you can rest after your hard day walking around Barcelona.Really a place tu suggest to friends!

<Content>Not as good as we expected We booked two Soho Terrace Rooms in May for a 5 day stay at the beginning of August. The Soho Terrace Rooms are advertised as 'Superior Room with extended living space and terrace with panoramic views of Barcelona.'At check in were advised that one of the two Soho Rooms was unavailable until the second day of our stay - resulting in our friend having the inconvenience of spending one night in a standard room and then moving on the second day. What we did see was that our friend鈥檚 standard room was the same size as the Terrance Rooms (in fact our Room 73 was smaller than our friends standard room). Our terrace was also nothing like that shown in the picture on the hotels web site. It was very small with just enough room for two chairs - and no sun lounger. The 'panoramic view of Barcelona' was in reality a view of the back of three apartment blocks, complete with washing hanging from windows around a court yard sized park. There is a gap between the apartment blocks and you can see the hills behind the city. We felt the need to keep the curtains closed while we were in the room to prevent people in the apartments seeing into the room.Our friend moved into Terrace Room 75 on the second day. This room had the terrace that was advertised on the hotels web site - complete with sun lounger and a lot more privacy! The room also had plumbing problems - with a sewerage type of smell every morning. We complained to management who appeared to be aware of the problem but could do nothing about it. On a more positive note, the rooms themselves are well equipped and the bed was comfortable. The hotel has a funky design that looks good. The central location of the hotel is reasonable good for sightseeing. The hotel has a small pool and roof terrace - however it only had a few sun loungers all of which were in use on the two occasions we wanted to use them.Breakfast was reasonable enough for this standard of hotel. Also worth mentioning was the front desk staff - who were friendly and generally helpful in booking resturants and providing local knowledge.Overall we were disappointed as, yet again in Spain, the premium features advertised for the more expensive rooms are just not delivered. We would be cautious about booking any premium room in any other NN Hotels for this reason.

<Content>soho: excellent hotel This hotel is really cool! We booked the superior room and that's really superior with the biggest private terrace we ever had (book far in front, there are only four rooms with a private terrace..)Terrace was warm and sunny in the morning and awesome to sit at night. The room was very spacious with a sitting area, perfect bed, cool lighting and a nice bathroom. Very clean. Staff was excellent and helpfull. I don't understand the complains from other writers about the roofterrace: it is gorgeous. And what do you expect on a roof: a swimmingpool from olympic size? it was all very nice and trendy. And the breakfast: where do you get this anymore for 13 euro?? So if you like a trendy, modern, friendly, dark luxourious environment: book the soho.

<Content>Disappointed We arrived at hotel mid afternoon after a 20 minute walk from Placa de Catalunya (main square where airport bus stops). After reading previous reviews we were surprised the hotel was this far away from the main tourist area. The hotel is situated on one of the main routes into the city centre and this four lane road generates a lot on noise all day and unfortunately all night as well. Also due to it being close to the local hospital there was constant sirens from ambulances. The room we were given was an inner room with no view and no natural light. This small sombre room was very depressing and we asked if we could be moved but were told the hotel was full and it was not possible. The polite staff assured us the next day there would be a choice of rooms available. The hotel consists of rooms overlooking the busy main road, inner rooms around a central shaft and rear rooms overlooking a park. The next day we were hoping for a rear room but were given one overlooking the main road, and although far brighter and cheerier the poor sound proofing caused terrible trafic noise. The other point worth noting is the hotel pool and seating area. The pool is tiny and has just 6 sunbeds around it. For a hotel with 51 rooms we thought this was inadequate, and in our 5 day stay we were unable to use it once. This was highly dissapointing as after paying a premium for staying in a hotel with pool facilities we wanted nothing more than to relax by the pool after a longday sightseeing. In hindsight we would have had better value if we had booked a hotel which was closer to the main attractions, quieter but without pool facilities.

<Content>Perfect Hotel My Fiancee and I stayed her for 5 nights in July 08. Could not possibly find fault with this hotel. Location was perfect and the bus from the Airport practially dropped us at the front door. It is close enough to all the attractions to make them very accessible but also far enough away that you can avoid the hustle and bustle by night and stay in the vicinity of the hotel to eat and drink. The staff all had excellent english and could not have been more obliging, twice we asked them to recommend a restaurant and goth times a success. The rooms are really funky even though a bit strange at first but once you got used to the decor they rocked! Overall I cannot possibly fault this hotel.

<Content>Really cool outfit Generally, the Soho Hotel is snazzy, located close to the city center, and the staff is friendly. We also really liked the roof terrace and the swimming pool area which was a great place for hanging out after a hot trip into town (and which offered a splendid view of the city). So, we'd definately recommend the Soho hotel to other travellers coming to Barcelona.The only downsides we can think of is that some of the rooms are facing the Grand Via which has a lot of traffic (we were lucky in that our room faced the back of the building and was completely quiet) and that the lighting scheme in the rooms was more cool than practical. But these are minor quarrels.

<Content>Impressive and a great rate I've stayed in a couple of boutique hotels in Barcelona, a city of great boutique hotels, sort of the San Francisco of Europe in that regard, and the Soho was the most impressive and fairly priced. Small but well-designed and functional rooms, including free wireless internet. There's a wonderful roofdeck, perfect for the Barcelona sun, and a small swimming pool. The location is also terrific, just a few minutes' walk from the Ramblas. (For the record, I also stayed at the Casanavoa, a popular boutique hotel that is virtually next door, and was less impressed, if only because the Casanova has no pool and charges for wireless.....) The Soho staff was a little snippy on occasion, but given the overall quality of the hotel, I'd recommend it enthusiastically.

<Content>Good modern hotel, well located We stayed here during Reyes for 4 nights in January.The hotel is modern and the facilities of a high standard. It's very similar to the High Tec chain of hotels that you find in cities all over Spain.Funky modern look, the glass wall surrounding the bathroom is a clever touch (don't worry is has built in blinds!).It's just as well that the room we had was comfortable as I was quite ill for 2 of the days ..almost made it to the Sagrada Familia if you catch my drift...so as a result I spent a lot of the time in the room. There's also a nice roof terrace and pool.There are quite a few places to choose from in this range but this is a reasonably priced, reliable clean hotel, well situated with competent polite staff.

<Content>Stunning! I've just returned from a long weekend with my bofriend staying at the Soho hotel in Barcelona, and I can honestly say that I have nothing bad to say about this hotel.Everything about the hotel is simple, stylish and modern. The terrace on the roof is beautiful, and the pool, although small, is very refreshing after a long day in the sun. We stayed in a standard room at the back of the hotel, so we had no problems with noise at all. The room itself was gorgeous, and it was obvious that every last detail had been carefully thought about. I particularly loved the bathroom with the automatic blinds. The design of the hotel really did make our whole stay seem so much more special.The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and the location of the hotel is fantastic. It takes less than ten minutes to walk to the ramblas (and thats at quite a slow pace), and the metro is literally on the other side of the road!We used the metro alot to get around to see the sites, and it was extremely easy and quick to use, so I would definately recommend it.All in all, a truly wonderful city, and a beautiful hotel that I hope to be visiting again soon!

<Content>So So Having read previous reviews, I perhaps expected too much of the Soho.You see, while the hotel is quite stylish, the rooms quite comfortable and the location good, there are some real spoilers.First, location. The hotel is on the Grand Vie, which is a very busy main road and, even though I requested a quiet room, it was very noisy.Next, the mood lighting in the rooms is novel, but completely impractical when you are trying to get ready for a night out, as you just look completely orange in the mirrors. Ladies beware!Also, when I asked for an iron I was told there was only 1 for the whole hotel, it was unavailable and I should use the laundry service provided by the hotel. I duly did this and have to say that my clothes seemed to come back with more creases then they started with. Not very impressive.There was also a broken tap in my room and the bathroom sink did not seem to produce hot water (though no problems with the bath/shower for water).That said, the beds are really comfy, the hotel is spotlessly clean, the room had a great power shower and the Ramblas is only about a 10 min stroll away. It is by no means a bad hotel, but it is not worth 5/5. I would try somewhere else.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location This was our second stay at the Soho. The hotel is in a perfect location in the Eixample and an easy walk to Placa Catalunya and Barri Gotic. The lobby is very small and there are only about 6 or 7 seven rooms per floor, so the hotel has a boutique feel. The rooms are good sized and very high-style. The window shades, including both the front windows and the partition between the shower and the bedroom are dramatic, but can be a little challenging to operate. The roof-top deck continues the high-style effect and has a great view of the city. The staff could not have been more helpful, particularly Alesso at the front desk who went out of his way to make restaurant reservations for us. We would definately be back!

<Content>Highly recommended My sister and I (both in our twenties) spent 4 nights at Hotel Soho at the beginning of July and we had a fantastic time. The ONLY negative was that our room was rather noisy at night due to the main road the hotel is located on - nothing an iPod or some earplugs didn't fix! Apart from this, I would certainly recommend this hotel to friends. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooftop pool/sun terrace is great for relaxing and our room was very spacious and clean. It's just a 10 mins walk from the city centre and 30 secs walk from the nearest metro station. PLUS.... Barcelona is fantastic!!

<Content>Alright hotel This was the first stop to a month long vacation traveling through Spain  Morocco with my husband and 4 year old son. We thought the hotel was okay. It was very clean, fine bed, and very small. We expected more for the price. The first room they put us in was like a little cagey feeling (in the back of the hotel)the only window opened up to a wall, so we asked to be moved to the front. They moved us no problem. The room was brighter and felt much better, but was very loud and at night the lights that they use on the outside of the hotel are somehow part of the front part of the room, and they stayed on all night shinning brightly. A bit annoying. We passed on the breakfast for nearly $20 usd...there are tons of little places nearby that are great.

<Content>Soho Fabulous I wrote a review back in February after a four night stay in Soho Hotel and commented on the awful smell of smoke in our room during our stay. I also posted the same review on the NN blog site on their invitation. So I feel that I should write the follow up review after our recent return to BCN and Soho.Asun, the Director/Manager, contacted me almost immediately after I posted my comments to discuss them further. I elaborated on the situation and as a consequence she offered me one night's accomodation in the hotel if we were in BCN again. We had already planned a trip from France to Spain in June and knew we had to overnight in BCN again so I accepted her offer.In the end we decided to stay a second night there and make a weekend of it. Beforehand, I had to post a parcel of clean clothes to the hotel so they would be there on our arrival as we were doing some mountain climbing in France. Carol, another member of staff, was incredibly helpful throughout. I also booked the second night on a hotel booking website and Carol made sure we had the same room for both nights which was incredibly generous as I would defintely think we had one of their best rooms.Asun came out to meet me when we arrived on Friday afternoon and I also met Carol, both of whom were incredibly friendly.We stayed in room 64 which was at the back overlooking the park. I have to say I had two of the most peaceful nights sleep I've had in a long time. The room was pitch dark, there wasn't a sound and the bed was so comfortable. We had breakfast both mornings and while I don't eat pastries etc the buffet was impressive and is substantial enough to keep you going for hours.I checked out the downstairs media room as I needed to look up my email and I was very impressed - two pc's, a printer, spare printer paper, a large flat screen tv and some comfie chairs too.The location of the hotel is ideal; close enough to stroll into the centre but out enough to avoid the maddening crowds. There's a metro stop across the road so you are within minutes of everything.Thank you to the management of Soho; they proved their worth and did something which hotels don't do very often - they listened to complaints. All in all, I would thoroughly recommend Soho for anyone who wants a little bit of luxury and comfort while staying in BCN. It's funky, contemporary, central and the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly.

<Content>great place to stay - great location, very nice hotel first of all, getting to the soho hotel from the airport. It's a piece of cake. Just hop on the airport bus, and the second or third stop I think it was is urgell. Hop off and the hotel is across the road. Even if you miss the urgell stop, hop off at the next one and it's 5 minutes walk back the way you just came.The hotel is very stylish, and we were greeted in a friendly manner by the reception staff.On going up to our room we were initially slightly disappointed that it was one of the interior rooms without a view (i think it is all rooms ending in 1 and 9 that are the interior ones). As it turns out it didnt matter as we werent in the room much, and it may even have been a benefit in terms of noise reduction. The room itself was clean and stylish. Large tv with plenty of connections if you take a laptop/media player to watch films at all. The lighting system is very smart too. Only complaint with the room is the shower screen, which has been mentioned numerous times is far to small so the floor gets very wet. Location wise it is about 10-15minutes walk to placya de catalunya, or 30 seconds to the urgell metro stop. The metro system is superb, and the T10 ticket seemed like good value to us.Breakfast was fine, a selection of fruits, breads, cheeses, ham, pastries and cereals, and some token hot items. A variety of juices and tea/coffee was also available.We didnt visit the media center, but the free wireless in the rooms is a definite + as it enabled us to take a look at tourist guides (we werent offered any guides or maps by the reception desk, but they do have a good map....that we got on the way home!)Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and it's location. Recommended.

<Content>Modern and slick Very nice little hotel. It is centrally located for most of the sights though not so for the beach if that is your thing. However it is very close to the underground and anywhere that is out of walking distance is only a few minutes away on Barcelona's efficient train system. We got a bus from the airport which dropped us off very near the hotel. Returning to the airport was not so simple as the bus does not pick up from that stop. This ultra modern hotel was clean and efficiently run. Our room was nicely decorated and the bed and bathroom were great. The toilet room was a bit dark! The only thing it missed was a kettle. Our room was high up so escaped the noise that may be heard from the lower rooms (note that I am not saying these rooms are noisy as I think they have double glazing - they just could be...). The breakfast was OK, we preferred to go out and get some good coffee and some pastries from the main market (15min walk). The two guys at reception were EXTREMELY helpful - particularly the Italian guy who's name I forget - thank you for all your advice and recommendations! I recommend this hotel.

<Content>Coolest hotel I've stayed in The interior design is pretty amazing: simplistic, modern, yet functional. There's a metro right next to the hotel so it was also a great launching spot for visiting various sites in the city. It's not as close to La Ramblas as compared to more pricey hotels, but the price more than compensate for that. Ramblas is too touristy anyways to walk around all day.Also, It was a pleasure just talking to Alessio, the coolest hotel receptionist, to hear him explain about the local scenes, culture, customs, and about his story. Let me know when you come over to Hong Kong, and I will show you around, Alessio!

<Content>Alessio - Thank you so much. When we decided to go to Barcelona, we wanted to stay in a hotel which fullfills most of our requirements. The SOHO-Hotel met all of our criterias. The rooms werent just comfortable, but also stylish, clean and very modern/cozy.The pool on the roof of the hotel offers you an amazing view over the city and especially over the Gran Via, where the hotel is located. Another big plus was the distance to the next metro station: 100 meters! Couldnt be any closer.The media and dining lounge are highly recommendable.Last but not least Alessio from the front-desk rounded up our stay: he was helpful (when we lost our wallet in barcelona), friendly and humorous. Thank you for this pleasent stay!!!! We will recommend the Soho!!!!

<Content>Contemporary  We couldn't recommend this place more highly. Not only is the interior decor very cool with some amazing back lit artwork and glass walled showers, but the staff are really friendly and helpful. It is in the perfect location, five minutes walk from the top of the Ramblas, 20 seconds from a metro station and a 鈧?0 taxi ride from the airport.The complimentary breakfast is excellent, as is the ambience of the restaurant area and we got an upgrade, free bottle of Cava and Tapas which all went down very nicely.Some people have moaned about the noise but we were facing Gran Via and, given that your in the middle of a big city, the noise was never a problem.If you are going to Barcelona, definitely stay here. The only problem we had, was that the rooftop pool and terrace was closed for refurbishment but they offered us alternatives and couldn't have done more to make our stay an excellent one.

<Content>Stylish I have just returned from a few days at the Hotel Soho. Highly recommended. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and Alessio at the front desk was outstanding and very helpful. The rooms are a great size and stylish and sexy. Very central , metro across the road, Las Ramblas a few blocks away. We stayed on the 4th floor and we could not hear any noises as I had read on other reviews. Also the rooms are pretty dark if you dont like that little ray of sunshine coming through while you sleep.The only thing I would say is that the TV volume only reaches 50 and not great sound if you have your window open.The bathroom was the main attraction as were the controls for the blinds and different lights.Would def go back without hesitation.

<Content>Superb Hotel Stayed at the Hotel Soho last weekend and loved the place. We had booked a superior 7th floor room with balcony overlooking the Gran Via and it was excellent. Very modern rooms with quirky electric blinds and a glass bathroom, the balcony is wooden decking with leather seats and overall the rooms are very comfortable. The breakfast is superb with fresh bread, hams and cheeses as well as fruit, cereal and pastries although we did think it was a bit steep at 13 Euro per person. There is a wonderful rooftop pool (unheated) and terrace with great views over the city. It doesn't have a bar but room service will supply beer, wine etc to the room if you want it. Ideal location for exploring, 5mins walk to University Sq and 15mins to Placa Catalunya and there's a metro station (Urgell), right outside the front door.Overall a superb hotel and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great overall experience... Great N煤帽ez i Navarro design hotel with funky rooms and nice breakfast.  + We really liked the funky rooms and the great terrace on the roof. + We enjoyed the nice breakfast and the fair room rates. + We accepted having to walk 15 minutes to reach La Rambla. - A real pool would have been nice. - We would have liked it a little closer to city centre.

<Content>Stylish and Sexy!! We stayed at the Hotel Soho at the end of Jan '08, and I have to say, we loved every minute of it. Our flight was delayed so we got a cab from the airport to the hotel, and were pleasantly surprised how quickly we arrived there (cost us about 25 euro). When we pulled up outside, we couldn't believe how stylish the hotel was, Soho really has the WOW factor!!The lobby is very contemporary, and the reception staff were very attentive and efficient (even though there was some confusion with our booking, this was resolved quickly). The rooms are where this hotel really oozes sex appeal, with the 'hot' and 'soft' mood lighting and modern bathroom with glass wall alongside the bath/shower (there are integral blinds you can close for privacy). The room was also a good size for a hotel so centrally located, (walking distance to las ramblas and just outside a metro stop), and had lovely comfortable beds with extra blankets provided, as the room was a little chilly at night. The real problem with sleep though is the NOISE!!As the hotel is located on a main road in a city which never sleeps, the traffic noise is constant. We traveled with another couple, who stayed in the room directly below us (at the front of the hotel), we are all in our twenties and took full advantage of the fantastic nightlife Barcelona has to offer, so we weren't exactly in bed early, but we all found the road noise an issue. Also, the floor level lights in the window recesses do not switch off and as the blinds do not block all of the light out, the room is never completely in darkness, which when added to the noise from outside can be really disturbing. I've since read another review from someone who took earplugs and eye masks to sleep in, and I think this is the solution!!We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, so cannot comment on it, but I would say that there are loads of great local cafes in which to eat and this is also a far cheaper option. Overall, our stay in Barcelona was fantastic, and was made all the better by staying at this hotel. If your looking for a chic, stylish hotel then the Soho has to be worth a look!!

<Content>Stylish and Sophisticated Soho Hotel was very modern and stylish. The hotel was clean and maintained to a very high standard. Soho hotel is located close to Las Ramblas and all the main attractions but was in an area that was not noisy during the night. The staff were friendly and helpful and spoke good English. I would highly recommend Soho Hotel and would stay there again if I was in Barcelona

<Content>The sexiest hotel at a very reasonable price Style Style Style -- This place has more of it than anywhere else I've ever stayed at. From the entrance to the corridor to the bedroom, the Soho hotel oozes sex appeal with its dimly lit metal decor and soft flowing orange hue. The room is spacious and modern, with attention paid to every small detail in the design of the room. The bedside light switches don't control individual lighting area, they assign a mood for the room, whether you want the mood to be cool, hot or normal. Apart from that, the room was well equipped and was very comfortable. Breakfast was decent, and the location is very convenient as you can get on the subway just steps from the hotel entrance and there are lots of good restaurants and bars within walking distance. It's in a great neighbourhood (Eixample) but it's also easy to get to anywhere from here with the metro.All in all, a great choice in Barcelona. I normally love trying new places and would not stay in the same place twice. But the Soho Hotel is too good to pass up, so I think I know where I'm staying on my next visit to BCN. Possibly the most stylish hotel in its price range anywhere in the world.

<Content>I doubt it get's better than this Having previously stayed at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona we thought we'd give one of their sister hotels a go and chose the Soho hotel on Gran V铆a Corts. What a great idea that was!After an easy journey from the airport via the aerobus we strolled through the Barcelona sunshine to the hotel which is just 5 minutes away from the Pla莽a de Catalunya. We were greeted by a smiling receptionist who booked us is with efficiency and politeness. Our room was a double with terrace at the rear of the hotel and it was perfect. Lots of space, a bathroom with a bath so comfortable we have decided to buy the same make for our bathroom at home, a wall of windows with blinds operated by the flick of a switch, a well stocked minibar, a large flat screen TV and one of the best beds I've had the pleasure to sleep in.There is a roof terrace with pool and a media centre downstairs with free internet access.Every member of staff we encountered was pleasant, helpful and had a genuine interest in us as guests of their hotel. This quality in the staff shone through with the only problem we encountered during our stay when we were woken by loud music and shouting coming from an adjoining building at 1am.We rang down to reception to ask for another room and within 5 minutes we were settled in another terrace room on the other side of the hotel - we didn't catch the guy's name but I wish more hotels dealt with such problems as this one did. If by any chance the person concerned reads this, thank you again.With so many places to dine in around the city we didn't sample the hotel for meals so can't comment on that aspect of the hotel.Barcelona has something for everyone in my opinion and I am pleased to say the Hotel Soho ticks all the boxes, as far as I am concerned, when it comes to finding somewhere to stay in this great city.

<Content>LOVED the SOHO!! Should be a 4* I am just back from a six night stay at the SOHO. We were originally a group of 8, 4 couples from NY and then we had another couple join us from France for 3 of the 6 nights. I can honestly say we had a fabulous time in Barcelona and staying at the SOHO was one of the highlights of the trip. I am a bit of a clean freak so I am on pins and needles when checking into a hotel worrying about its cleanliness....the SOHO was immaculate the common areas were very clean the rooms were spotless and the maids were accommodating and honest. I had dropped a few euros under my bed and thought I would pick them up in the morning, I had forgotten about them until I returned to my room later and found that the maid had found them and placed them on my nightstand. WOW was I impressed with that.The rooms are fantastic and quite modern and the beds so comfortable. I loved the idea of the mood lighting and the blinds that controlled the view into the bath/shower. Please do not let this throw you off as if you require privacy the blinds in the shower/bath can be completely turned so that you have 100% privacy. If I were to have only one suggestion for the hotel it would be for more lighting in the bathroom but that would truly be my only one slight negative complaint. We had the breakfast included and it was great, lots of choices and all very delicious. We were so content with our breakfast that we never needed to stop for lunch. The location of the SOHO is amazing, besides having the two metro stations and several bus stops outside your door (less then a 30 second walk) you can walk to almost all the tourist attractions. AMAZING!!The whole staff at the SOHO are friendly and welcoming but there are two in particular that make you feel like family Alessio and Oliver. If I could sit here and write to you how FANTASTIC these two men are I would be witting for days. I have done quite a bit of traveling and have stayed at many hotels never have I come across two like Alessio and Oliver who besides always greeting you with a bright smile took the time to treat you like you were the only guest at the hotel and took their time to explain things of the city, sites to see and those to avoid, places to eat and made the reservations for you. It blows my mind that this hotel is a 3 star....if I were giving out the stars this should be a 4 star superior. All in all I have to say that my group of 10, we were all beyond pleased with the SOHO with the staff, its location. If ever in Barcelona again and I will be because it a wonderful city.....Hotel SOHO for me!Thank You SOHO for making our tip the Best!!!! I do not have any photos but we stayed in the Urban Rooms in the back of the hotel and it was just like it shows on the hotel website (Rooms42)

<Content>Loved it ! Just got back from a weekend in Barcelona with a friend and it was great. HOTEL:the hotel was lovely the decor is very contemporary so if you are not into it then dont stay here. However for those of you that love the latest well dressed minimalistic look to your room then this is the place. With buttons to change the mood of the lighting in the room and flat screen tv of a decent size i loved my room and would definately stay here again. (got to watch a bit of the african football tournament)The pool was nice but it was not hot enough for us to get in but its location catches great sun. would be great in hotter weather.the media room was also nice with fast internet access and nice seating great for relaxing in front of the tv - nicely decorated alsoI didnt have breakfast at the hotel but the breakfast loung looked lovely.The staff were lovely and very helpful giving us directions and guidance on the train systems and local attractions, restaurants and bars.LOCATION;the location is great if you are up to the challenge of walking a couple of blocks or jumping on the train to and from ...for those of you with bigger budgets there are taxis everywhere so you never get stuck. My friend and i took the metro everywhere as we wanted experience barcelona transport and once we did a journey we realised it was so easy to understand we didnt bother with taxis again. (you can purchase a 10 journey travelcard for 7 euros which allows you on and off the train for ten journeys anywhere)EVERYTHING WAS CLOSE TO THIS HOTEL (but obviously not on the doorstep)ATTRACTIONS: there are so many things to see so ensure to ask reception for a map and get sight seeing ..the beach is only a short train ride away, le rambles is great in the day and even more fun in the night, sangrada familia is nice, picasso museum and loads more ..oh and lots of shopping.NIGHTLIFE:we ended up at an R'N'B club called JAMBOREE which was great and drinks were reasonably priced - a small bottle of wine (1 and a half glasses) was only 5 euros. Malibu and coke was 8 Euros. 10 euros to get into the club (it was well worth it but there are loads of peopleoutside giving out flyers for discount). Overall this hotel is great and i would recommend it to anyone who loves contemp decor and exteremely stylish and relaxing hotel.

<Content>Good value, great location Overall I was very satisfied with my 4 night stay. I would recommend asking for a room in the back. They are larger and quieter than the rooms in the front. The breakfast was 13 euros. We skipped it and opted instead to eat at the numerous nearby restaurants and bakeries. They advertise as having free wireless service in the rooms, but we actually had to connect via ethernet. They atleast offered a free connection wire at the front desk. There were 3 ethernet plugs in the room, but only one of them actually worked. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The rooms have fun features and are well maintained.

<Content>Not a great hotel! Why this place gets rave reviews is beyond me. We booked here for 4 nights in a deluxe room back in early December 2007 on the recommendations listed on this web site. There's nothing charming about this hotel except its location. The first night we stayed was a sleepless night with loud noise in the street. The walls are paper thin and heard the TV/Guests yelling in the next room. The bathroom was dirty with hair in sink, toilet needed to be cleaned (found yellow stains on seat) and had to call housekeeping to clean it to our standards. The room size was ok but needed some inprovement in terms of decor  furniture. There was a musty odor the entire stay but the hotel could not change our room because the hotel was booked up. The breakfast was below average and not worth the price. Your better off going to local cafes just steps outside the hotel. The halls in the hotel need improvement and you can smell the same musty odor outside the room. It took over an hour to check with just 4 other people ahead of us. They only had 1 person at check in.Bottom line.. Look at other hotels in Barcelona. We do not recommend staying at this hotel.

<Content>WARNING.................Never ever stay here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! following our weekend stay in Barcelona we were contacted by the hotel to inform us that one rooms had not been paid for and that a member of our group would be charged through their credit card as a result. The room in question was paid by cash on check in and the key for the room was issued. The hotel refused to hand over the key without being paid, so it had to be paid for.The payment for the room was credited before we were informed that it was going to be taken and to me they knew exactly what they were doing and it would not surprise me if this was not the first time this happened. How could a hotel let a group of people leave the hotel without paying for a room....I think that emphasises my comments above. We will be making a formal complaint to the Embassy and to as may hotel booking systems on the internet that are available.......NEVER EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

<Content>Soho Hotel-Great Staff and Location I stayed at the Soho Hotel in August of this year and had a fantastic experience. I travel to Europe quite frequently and quite a few times I've been surprisingly dissapointed by the hotels I've booked, no air conditioning, small room etc...in summary they were vastly different than their description.This being my first trip to Barcelona I didn't know what to expect. That being said, the Soho was fantastic. It's in a great location about a block from the top of the Ramblas. The hotel is clean, funky and everything works! They have very relaxing rooftop pool, small but refreshing with a garden surrounding it on the roof. They also have computers in a cool lounge and they work.Most of all, I liked the staff. Alessio, is just a great manager. He made us feel like family and even went out to dinner with us at one of his favorite places! You'll never find anyone who will go out of his way like he does. Also, Barcelona is great. It's clean, gorgeous, like a Paris with beaches. Also, ask Oliver for his favorite Tapas bar if you don't want to make tourist mistakes. Overall, great hotel and great staff! Stay here and you won't be dissapointed.

The rooms are so modern and I love the buttons to open and close the blinds in the widows and also, check out those sexy showers. Don't miss the hot light button. The property is very clean. The free internet downstairs was much appreciated. The staff was so friendly and willig to assist in any way. Great location and just across the street from the Metro. I can't wait to go back.

<Content>A Wonderful Stay We just got back from a fantastic trip across Europe and looking back at our time spent in Barcelona, the Hotel SOHO was a perfect launching ground for us.I was a little nervous at first to be heading to Europe for the first time, but my worries were laid to rest the moment we arrived at the hotel. The staff all spoke several languages each and were able to make me feel right at home. I was impressed that the front desk attendants were able to speak with me in English, and other guests in French, Spanish, German, and more all at once and in a manner that was warm and welcoming.Our room looked brand new and had all of the ammenities we needed. One of the highlights of the room was that the lights and window blinds were controlable by buttons on the bedside table. There was even a HOT button that would automatically dim the lighting and adjust the room to a hot mood. Every morning we enjoyed complimentary breakfast in the hotel's dining area consisting of assorted cereals, fruits, meats  cheeses, breads, eggs, sausages and more.From the hotel it was very easy to see the city and set out on our tours by foot. Within a couple of blocks we found great historical sites, museums, and fantastic shopping. The hotel's concierge was also a great help in pointing us in the right direction to make sure we saw the most important places on our list. There was also a subway station across the street from the hotel that proved to be a perfect launching ground for our trips to other parts of the city.Barcelona is an amazing city and the Hotel SOHO made our stay all the more memorable, I can't wait to go back again.

Great staff, willing to speak English and very supportive. We liked the downstairs lounge with internet access. The breakfast was great and it's important to have a full breakfast before going sight-seeing since the dollar is taking a beating vs the euro. Very centrally located and we walked to Las Ramblas and the central shopping areas in 10 minutes. Good tapas restaurants nearby also. A great small hotel when you are tired of the giants.

<Content>Nice Stay The reservation booking online was simple and efficient, with an easy website in English. The rates changed over the course of the stay, due to a busy National Day weekend. The location in Exiample was great, easy access to the Metro right outside and plenty of great cafes for breakfast, afternoon lunch or tapas. We never even stopped on the 1st floor for the morning breakfast, it was more fun to see what was going on out in the city! The guest room was very contemporary with clean lines, lots of glass and technology for lighting effects, blind control on the windows, etc. The guest room safe is poorly placed inside the closet, hard to see the display. The minibar is simple but gives you a beverage when you want! I liked the aesthetics of the room, but did not love them and for six nights it got a little old. The room we had was on an interior air shaft which did not allow much light into the room (downer with some jetlag from Los Angeles), additionally the sound from the street bounces right up the shaft from the street level ramp which goes to the underground garage. Voices, traffic and the sound of sirens bounced into the room day and night.The free computers on the -1 level were helpful to both my partner and to me over the course of the stay. Be careful and clear the cache of your site visits when you get up, some interesting stuff left on the computers from other users!We checked out the rooftop pool and lounge area and wished for even warmer weather to go for a swim, but took some photos from the roof and moved on.Best asset of this hotel is Oliver at the front desk. His dedication to the help of guests is amazing. I manage a Hotel in Los Angeles and would love to have clones of Oliver at my property. He made a huge difference in our stay. Other staff at the desk were friendly, always offering a Hola! when we came and went, but not much more. Housekeeping was able to fix a problem with our bathroom sink pretty efficiently on day two.There are lots of options in Barcelona to stay, this is a nice hotel with a good location, it was clean and modern. I would be interested in trying other properties on future visits as well, but would recommend SoHo!

<Content>Great little hotel I thought this was a great little hotel. The rooms are a good size for a major city and cleverly-designed to make the most of space. The shower was excellent and the bed was very comfortable. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. Also, I thought room service and the minibar were reasonably-priced. Breakfast was really good too.The location was really useful - within 15 minutes we could walk to Las Ramblas, the Barri Gotic, and the Passag de Gracia (where many of the Gaudi buildings are). Also, it's only half a block from a metro station, where the airport bus also sets down.The best bit is probably the rooftop area with a lovely shady deck and a pool for cooling off and chilling out (more like a big jacuzzi though - you can't really swim in it).There were a few niggles - the sink and bath didn't drain properly unless we took the plug out. Also the noise from the park outside really intruded in the evening, since all the neighbourhood kids were playing there, very loudly. Thankfully they did all go to bed by the time we wanted to go to bed. But overall, I was really happy with our stay and would definitely stay again.

Flat screen TV . air conditioning , it was a great room, every thing a city break hotel is meant to be.  The bathroom has glass walls, you can watch telly while you shower. so not for the shy.  We had breakfast as well and even the restaurant is ultra chic. In dark woods and the food is good.  Stay here that all i want say.

Oliver, who was so helpful with ideas, restaurants, directions and was so welcoming and so genuinely happy that he was a joy to talk to. Guiermo, who could not do enough for us even when we asked him to call a million hotels in Seville when we were trying to book the next part of our trip, and Allesio who greeted us each and every night with a smile and questions about how our evening turned out.  They really made our stay and made us feel welcomed. The hotel has a small pool and a fabulous roofdeck lounge and it麓s great to have that to come back to after a day of sightseeing.  The rooms are very modern and clean and location is great...out of the 麓crazineness麓but close enough to walk to Las Ramblas and El Born and other areas.

<Content>Most rude staff encountered in all of Barcelona. Went to stay at this hotel to be nearer to city attractions. We encountered one staff person who was particularly rude, unwilling to point us in the direction of the currency exchange, seemed annoyed at any request. When she completely forgot to give us our wakeup call, which we requested in person, for the day we were flying out, I was appalled. It's one thing to not give good service-but missing a wake up call? Come on now. What was worse was the complete lack of acknowledgement that this could have been a potentially disasterous mistake. The designers of the hotel should have spent less time on the state of the art electrical system, and invested in an alarm clock. The roof top deck was beautiful, but there were many other beautiful hotels in Barcelona with rooftop pools. The proximity to Las Ramblas is hardly a reason to stay at this hotel.

<Content>Hotel Soho a fantastic Hotel. Stayed at the Soho Hotel at the begining of August and could not fault this Hotel at all. The staff on the front desk were very helpful and the rooms were gorgeous. The rooftop pool area is a lovely feature with great views, I think if there was a bar it would be even better. The area where the hotel is located is very central and safe and everywhere is within walking distance.I would highly recommend the hotel and would definetely stay again.

<Content>What a gem! We stayed at SOHO at the beginning of August 2007 over the weekend of my girlfriend's birthday and disappoint it certainly did not!It goes without saying that Barcelona the city is itself one of Europe's finest ...it quite simply has everything you want - sunshine, fantastic architecture / galleries, history, friendly locals, culture, transport links, great restaurants / bars / clubs and even a beach to boot! With this in mind, you'd expect the hotel experience to figure a lot lower down on the list of memories...First up, the hotel is in a great location (a few blocks walk to Las Rambla and city centre), is beautifully designed throughout to the most intricate of details (we loved the room's electric blind features almost as much as the mood lighting options!), has great views of the city from the 'chill-out terrace' on the roof, has free internet if you're one of those that needs to be permanently connected, has a more than satisfactory breakfast option, and offers the perfect base for a short stay in the city. It's decent value too!The chic, design-led experience of the hotel was bettered only by the helpfulness and friendliness of certain members of staff at SOHO, particularly Alessio and Oliver who couldn't do enough to help us find the best combination of tourist spots, restaurants and bars throughout our stay in Barca! Thanks so much guys!My only regret is that we didn't stay for a few more days!5 STARS * * * * *(JON  SHELLEY)NB: Insist on a room that faces the street - the others can lack natural light

<Content>highly recommended Cool hotel, great location only 10 minutes or so walk from la ramblas. staff were exceptional, keen to offer advice on what to see and friendly throughout our stay. rooms are comfortable, clean, the only minor irritations were no balcony and our room faced onto the main road which was was noisy well into the night. roof top terrace lovely for lounging with your morning coffee.

<Content>Don't stay here - I want it to remain a secret... This is the hippest place to stay in Barcelona, and in terms of European accommodation the value for money is incredible. Make sure you book through the hotel website, and ask for a quiet room if you are a light sleeper. The whole place oozes cool, to the point where you feel overcool at times. Allesio is incredibly helpful, the rooms are stylish, the shower is fun, and the light switches will amuse you for minutes. The hotel is a little bit out of the way, but it is a short walk to all the Barcelona activities, and not far from the metro, if you want to travel underground. Go there with your special friend... you will not be disappointed.Try the lollies... and get back to me with what flavour they are? Cola? Orange? Lemon? Couldn't really work it out.

<Content>Very nice hotel I have stayed recently at the Soho Hotel, in Barcelona, with my wife and children. We all enjoyed very much our stay during the whole holiday period. We were delighted by the professional attitude and good humour of Alessio, at the reception desk. His suggestions were very precious for us all. Besides, the hotel is a very good choice for several reasons. Good location, design and confort, convenient prices. All good reasons to repeat the experience and come back, in the future!

<Content>Fantastic value Hotel Soho turned out to be a great value and a terrific place to recover after the horrors of trans Atlantic jet travel! Many thanks to the helpful reviews that helped me choose it鈥?I arrived at about 1:30 p.m. and my room was ready (a major plus in the great-first-impressions department). Didn't love the view -- I was on the interior, fairly low floor so never even sure of the weather and just looked into another room -- but frankly I was so tired I didn't care. The room itself is spare and sleek, comfortable bed, plenty of television channels, excellent (and free) wireless access, great tub and nice bath products. I also loved the location. Now, admittedly, more chi chi places are located on the neighborhood's more prestigious streets (like Passaig de Gracia and Las Ramblas Catalunya) but the Soho is about four easy blocks from the heart of downtown and the area felt very safe (both day and night). There's a charming pool area (small) on the roof; I checked it out but didn't have time to hang there. Next trip. Also breakfast was included but I overslept so missed it (perils of jet lag), so can't report on that. The hotel staff was pleasant if not effusive and I'm appreciative of one woman's restaurant recommendation -- it made my one night stay! It's a classic Catalonian tapas place (right off Las Ramblas) called, I believe, Catalunya. Just fantastic. She told me to get there early (by 9 p.m.); I got there at 8 p.m. and had to wait an hour! Totally worth it though. At the front desk they do seem inclined to send you to restaurants in the more tourist-oriented part of Eixample but I found one I loved just a block from the hotel called Zian. It's new (and when I mentioned it to the hotel staff they were dismissive -- hadn't been there) but just a lovely place for lunch, terrific pasta and pizza and seafood, indoor and outdoor seating, nice wine list鈥nd great service. The hotel itself was excellent value for money; I paid about 180 euros on a high season Saturday night (when most other hotels in the category were significantly higher in price or sold out altogether); I used Trip Advisor's check rates feature. It's nifty. You submit your date and your property and it shows all the hotel sites that have rooms. I was shocked at the price differentials (Expedia and other American sites tended to charge significantly more but it really did vary). I booked through a European site called Venere.com and was pleased.Great stay. Would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>Fantastic hotel with great staff We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights end of June.All hotel reception staff fantastic particularly Oliver who could not have been more helpful. The rooms were very clean, modern and Funky - we could not find any faults.There is a bakers/cafe opposite which is very cheap and exellent quality if you just want a coffee and some croissants etc.The roof top area is brilliant the pool is very small and very shallow - probably only about 3 - 4 feet deep but nice to cool off in. There is a large shady area with lots of comfy chairs to relax in.I would agree with most of the previous reviews an excellent hotel with great staff to which we will definitely return.We ate one night at agua restaurant on the beach near arts hotel about 10 鈧?by Cab food here is excellent and good value however as its mentioned in most guide books it gets very busy so would not go there any evening without booking - make sure you book a table on the terrace for nice sea views.

<Content>Make sure you book through the hotel website! This is a lovely hotel in a great location, but whatever you do, make sure you book through the hotel's own website because hotels.com charged us an extra $90 per night for booking through them. A big mistake on our part, which dampened what was otherwise an excellent stay. The staff are really helpful and the rooftop pool terrace is lovely.

<Content>Tragically hip, but in a nice way Well situated in the L'Eixample area in Barcelona, Soho Hotel is a property with a modern design. The hotel is easy to find, located right on one of the main thoroughfares in Barcelona. From the hotel, you have easy access to the Metro (one stop is 100 meters away), bus service is just up the street and to cabs (don't choose this option). You can also hoof it to areas such as Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter (each about 10-15 minute walk).The rooms are about average size and have all the normal amenities. A nice wide screen tv can be found, along with a mini-fridge (perfect for chilling a bottle of Cava for an evening drink on the roof top deck). The beds are a bit hard, but ok. The glass walled shower looks right into the room (if you are voyuer you can keep this open while you bathe, or close it off with blinds). In addition to the normal lighting, there are options for 'warm' and other lights to set a mood, if you so desire. The staff was nice, but not overly informed. They were helpful in finding some locations around the city, but not great with directions. Instead of the hotel breakfast, we opted for a bite at a local cafe (better and cheaper). One of the highlights is the rooftop deck with small pool. The deck is nice, with two areas for seating. The pool itself is small, probably the size of a front porch. Nicely designed, it is good for a late afternoon drink and dip. Overall, the hotel was nice, about as expensive as I would expect for a hotel in the city. If you are looking for a modern design hotel, with a pretty good location, this is worth a try.

<Content>Wicked Place Stayed here in Jan 07, present to myself for my 21st Bday. couldn鈥檛 believe my luck when i rolled up to the outside with my trolley dolly case and mum in tow. arrived way to early for checking, but the staff accommodated us in any event and we got our room over looking the street (which was the only downside, as the traffic never gives up).hotel is modern and has a button for everything, although it took us a while to figure out the shower blinds. toiletries provided really helped as my mum forgot her toothbrush. breakfast was good, with the waitress greeting you with a smile and a Hola! and the curtsey of showing you where everything was. the roof top pool wasn鈥檛 open, but the area was amazing and you could sit up there in the mornings or evening as relax. it would be nice in the summer to sit up there and chill out. free internet access was available although we had too much to do, to check that out. transport links are good, taxi's go past every few minutes, although we used the Metro (just a few minutes walk outside the front doors) and for about 拢7 for two days unlimited travel well worth it, so much better than the London Underground. everything tourist wise is within metres of the Metro, so i would suggest getting on it, as walking around Barcelona is nackering. Visit Las Ramles, Gaudi Catherdal and Nou Camp they were my highlights. Excellent and Friendly staff, beautiful room and quiet location (bar the traffic). Definite recommendation in by book.

<Content>Great location, great price, great staff, great room Short but sweet....we went on the Easter weekend so Barcelona was not exactly happening but we enjoyed it all the same. Olivier at the reception was exceptionally helpful and made our stay very comfortable. Our room was peaceful, very clean and funky. Location close enough without being right on top of everything. All in all great value and I would stay again.

<Content>Lovley Funky Hotel! Hotel Soho in Barcelona is really cool! My boyfriend and I stayed there from March 29th - April 2nd. Completely agree with the previous reviewer -loved the hotel, really funky decor and lighting, breakfast was delicious, staff very helpful (only downside - we faced an inner courtyard, so didn't have much natural light). Wish it had been warmer as pool and roof terrace were lovely.Great location - 10 mins walk to Las Ramblas, approx 30 mins walk to the sea/port/maremagnum shopping centre. 2 recommendations for restaurants within walking distance (both modern though, not traditional) - Tribeca bar  restaurant turn left out of the hotel, few 100 yds down on left and Celler de Tapas which is on the Placa Universitat (on the way to Las Ramblas) - gorgeous food, great service.
