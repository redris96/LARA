<Content>Great, inexpensive, close to the city! The Edwardian is a great hotel for a single person looking for value for money whilst in San Fransiscio.I stayed there for two nights and was very happy with my room - with a double bed, adequate bathroom and tv. It was quiet both in terms of street noise and other guests in the hotel. There are no closets in the room (so if you have a suit, bring a hanger and hang it in the bathroom).The Edwardian is very close to the city and the Mission with a bus stop litterally outside the door. There are also a number of amazing places to eat right down stairs.

<Content>A Great Place to Stay My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Our room was clean and quiet, and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. This is a wonderful early 1900's building with lots of character, cozy sitting areas on every floor, very nice room decor, etc. The location is perfect, with a multitude of great restaurants and bars within easy walking distance, and about a 15 minute drive to the airport. The continental breakfast included fresh squeezed orange juice, and the room price was more than reasonable. We'll definitely look forward to staying here the next time we're in San Francisco!

<Content>Nice spot on Market Street I stayed in a shared bathroom room at the Edwardian and considering the location and services and charater of the hotel it was an excellent value. The hotel is a little old but it has its own style more interesting than the cookie-cutter chain hotels. Staff friendly and helpful. Excellent location. i used to live nearby in San Jose and will most likely be visiting occasionally now so checked up on several other hotels in Soma, Nob Hill and surroundings and the others are either more expensive or seedy, or both, so this one is the best deal.

<Content>The only place to stay in SF When I booked my room at the Edwardian at a danish website I had no idea what to expect. I just needed a room in a hurry at a reasonable price. But when I arrived at the hotel and got into my room, I instantly realized, that this was the only place to live in San Francisco. I travel all the time and I have stayed in many hotels all over the world. And it's very rare that you find hotels who have a soul. This one has it. But if you are looking for a fancy designer hotel this is not something for you. However, if you are looking for authenticity, this is the only place you want to stay.I will definitely come back. Again and again.

<Content>Makes Motel 6 feel like the Ritz Absolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Granted I payed $84 per night in SF, I may have got what I payed for and more...an itchy scalp and grossed out stories to tell my friends. Cons: The curtains, carpet, and bed sheets were draconian and filthy. There was hair on my bed sheets not belonging to me. It took me 2 hours to get my towels replaced and then after all the hassle, I was given 1 new small towel. The bathroom was outside for some rooms (prior to the renovation, guests shared bathrooms) and although I was told one of the outside bathroom was assigned to my room only, there was no outside lock meaning anyone can come and use the bathrooms and I couldn't keep my toiletry safe. At night, it was impossible to read due to the poor lighting. Plus up until about midnight, you could hear the restaurants downstair emptying their trash and glass bottles. Definitely bring your ear plugs for this one. Also no AC/fan, only a heater. So to get air into the stinky rooms, one have to open the windows and deal with the outside noise.Pros: Very few. The front desk staff was pretty nice. Most of the time they were running around dealing with problems. Also beware of late check in, as you'll have to call the emergency number to get someone to check you in.

<Content>GROSS! Dirty dirty DIRTY and dirty some more. Bugs and mildew, I've stayed in hostels cleaner than this place. The smell is musty, the elevator makes you feel like you'll never get out alive and the manager is an idiot.What a retched hotel, They should hand out ointment for whatever bugs we left with. We slept in our clothing with our jackets as blankets as we were afraid the linens weren't clean. For the price, even with a significant discount, it's not worth a stay.

Discounts for repeat visitors. Within very close proximity of union square and the Haight. Best of all is the cafe opposite - cafe trieste, which is excellent and serves great food. The manager of the hotel - a moroccan guy, is really helpful and accomodating. Hotel also very quiet. Ive stayed there twice and would highly recommend

Staff WAS friendly but the room was so small, smelly, noisy and it also came with a surprise underneath the bed. As we where packing up to go we found a condom wrapper, I felt so disgusted! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Central location, unreliable booking, friendly mgt. We booked two connected rooms with two double beds each with a shared bath. I spoke directly with someone at the hotel. It was difficult to communicate with the person at the hotel and I was concerned the reservation was not correct. When I called the hotel a week later, my fears were confirmed. They had the wrong number of rooms per night and the wrong room accommodations. It took two calls to correct the mistake. When we arrived in SF to check in, we found our reservation had been screwed up again. Instead of two rooms with two beds each (which evidently doesn't exist) we had on room with a private bath and one bed and one room with a double and singe bed and no private bath. Not only were the rooms not connected, but we didn't have enough room for everyone to sleep! We had to switch rooms different nights and never got the rooms we wanted. We listened as another group of 3 ladies went through the SAME PROCESS! BEWARE! I noticed others commented on this too....The rooms are tiny, but with tons of charm. The hotel was older and not the cleanest, but definitely acceptable. The staff was friendly and helpful. Despite all the confusion, I would probably stay here again. It was a fun experience and a GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD.

<Content>Great Location on a Budget I arrived in San Francisco on Saturday and found that the Edwardian is located on 1 of the main streets, making it convenient to the buslines and walking to many places. Right outside, you can catch the 71 bus and for $1.50 and 10-15 minutes of your time, be in the famed Haight/Ashbury neigborhood. Across the street is a coffee house with entertainment every night and great coffee/eats. The aroma of something delicious kept wafting into the building and I noticed there are some fairly swanky restaurants in the direct vicinity of the hotel. The Edwardian, itself, is clean and, from my experience, safe as you need a key to get in the front door. Some of the other hotels in this price range I researched had complaints about panhandlers and unsavory neighborhoods. That was not my experience at the Edwardian. I felt fairly safe coming in after midnight alone, though there is always a safety issue that late in a big city. I had a small, single room with private bath. Yes, it was not a large room, but I was only there to sleep/shower, and I was alone, so it wasn't like I needed much. Maid service came by everyday and changed linens/towels. The building itself was for the most part quiet. The 2nd floor offers a small reading room with comfy chairs, while the 1st floor (not the lobby) offers a pc with internet (somewhat pricey at 30 cents a minute, but OK if you are only checking email) and coffee/tea. The buildling is an older building, perhaps early 1910's-20's. The old elevator might not be completely handicap friendly as it has the iron gate that you have to pull open to get in an out of, but I found it to be charming. In all, I would have to say I enjoyed my 4 nights here. It was safe, quiet, inexpensive, clean, and had a charm that you don't see in the newer, chain hotels.

<Content>Best deal in town! I stayed at the Edwardian for 7 nights and was offered a room with a shared bathroom for just $50/night. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a great location--between the Castro district and downtown--some very nice cafes and restaurants right across the road. The hotel has character and is the best budget place I've ever stayed in. I highly recommend it.

<Content>Beware - bait and switch After making a pre-paid reservation, I arrived at this hotel with my wife and was informed they had no rooms available with a private bathroom, so I would have to accept a room with a shared bath, because my booking had a cryptic ROH notation, which apparently meant I could be given whatever room was available at the hotel. The front desk manager was the slowest and least attentive one I have seen in a while. He did not offer any sort of refund. There were 3 other couples who arrived that night who were equally shocked that they would have to stay in a room with no private bath. The fact that there were shared-bath/toilet rooms was not disclosed ANYWHERE in the reservation.The room itself was the tiniest I have ever seen (and I have stayed at 100+ hotels), with very dirty windows, construction and a loud bar/club downstairs. For the second day of our two-day stay we were allowed to switch rooms to a decent room on the top floor with a private bath, but by that time our experience had been completely ruined by the horrible first night. My wife refused to shower in the shared bath.

<Content>Just okay We stayed at the Edwardian for a couple of nights in October 2007.To begin with, I'm not a picky man when it comes to hotels. My number one requirement is that they are clean, and the Edwardian was clean. The other positive was its location, with an F line train stop less than one block away, which will take you to Fisherman's Wharf and the rest of the city's sites. Plus, for San Francisco, $120 / night doesn't get you much. The list of negatives include the hotel loosing our reservation (fixed it with a bit or waiting around), no parking (parking close by means five blocks to a secured underground parkade), tiny rooms, and a bed and furniture that are very tired relics from the 70s.All in all, I probably wouldn't stay at the Edwardian again. I'd either spend more on a better hotel with parking, or I'd stay in a suburb like Dublin that is on the BART subway line and ride into downtown for the day.

<Content>Very clean and comfortable - perfect for our needs Really was pleased with this spartan hotel which was very clean and comfortable, staff was helpful. The hotel, room and common areas were dimunitive and the back rooms faced a construction site that was noisy and unsightly but unless you plan on spending a lot of time inside your room during the day it will not be an issue. The central location of the hotel is ideal, very public transit accesible. We highly recommend this place as a good 2-3 star budget option for central SF.

<Content>Omg Stay Away! This hotel was horrible! When I arrived at the hotel they claimed to have lost my reservation and instead placed me in a room with NO BATHROOM! The communal bathroom was horrible, lacked privacy and the shower didn't work. To add insult to injury the room was FREEZING andhad no heat. All they could offer was an extra blanket. When I asked to speak to a manager the night watchman informed me that he was gonefor the evening and I had to speak to him once he returned in the morning! The next day they corrected the mistake and placed me in the correct room. My question was WHY DIDN'T IT HAPPEN THE FIRST TIME. Geez please stay away!

<Content>I literally cried when I had to stay here The Edwardian Hotel did not meet even my very low expectations. My room was VERY small and smelled like smoke. The comforter on the bed was old and worn, and it was ripped on the side. I was so grossed out by the comforter that I put it on the floor and did not sleep underneath it. The knob that is used to open/close the blinds was broken, and there was mold in the caulking of the shower. This hotel is in an area of town near what is called Fillmore, but I was informed by a friend that locals refer to it as Filthymore. Make no mistake, the Edwardian is NOT in a good part of town. It is in an area also known to locals as the tenderloin, - NOT a compliment. There was no deadbolt on the door to my room, and there are no screens on the windows. There is no A/C - you must open the window to cool down the room. And without a screen and knowing you're in a bad part of town, this is not a safe option. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It was awful, and I got out of there as soon as I could. I am not exaggerating that I cried (yes, I'm a woman but still...) and was SO thankful when I was able to find something else.

<Content>Good budget hotel The Edwardian is a great place for those of us trying to stay within a budget during a trip to San Francisco! The rooms are tidy and well-maintained; we were pleasantly surprised by the size of our en-suite bathroom. The hotel is on Market Street, close to several fun bars and restaurants and within walking distance of Mission Street, Haight-Ashbury, and the BART. There was some street noise on weekday mornings, so bring earplugs if you like to sleep late. My only real complaint is that our bed was not terribly comfortable. Overall, this hotel is a good bargain and definitely worth a look.

<Content>Consider it an Adventure Like most things in life, proper expectations are important. Had I known that by booking this room through Priceline I could have ended up with a shared bath, I would not have gone through Priceline. After my bid went through, I found out about this possibility. Reading the reviews, I was hoping for the best yet bracing for the worst. What I ended up with was closer to the best end of the scale. My only bit of trouble came from trying to find the off site parking. The web page has incorrect pricing and location. This really should be changed promptly. I spent about 20 minutes driving around looking for public or street parking and could not find anything. Finally I called the hotel and was told where the public parking lot was located. The cost was $8.00 for overnight (until 6am) and $12 for 6am to 6pm. I planned on leaving about 7:30 the next morning and did not want to pay $12 for another hour and a half. Luckily the lot attendant was still there and told me there would be no problem staying until 7:30. The charge was only $8.00. Considering one of my co-workers stayed at another property and the parking charge was $40 for the 13 hours he was there, I felt I got a great deal! The public parking lot was less than 2 blocks away (not long blocks but if toting a lot of luggage this could be an issue - no place on the street to pull over while you check in and drop off luggage). Check in was quick and the manager was very friendly. He asked me if I had a preference for room location and I told him I would just like to have a private bath. He did explain that Priceline rooms were run of the house and that could mean a shared bath. I was lucky and the hotel was not full so a private bath would not be a problem. He indicated there were 2 rooms on each floor that shared a bath, but the remaining 40 (I think this was the number he said) rooms all had private baths. He called the lift for me and showed me how to operate it. Very old world and charming. The room was indeed small, with the bed pushed up against one wall. One small table for a night stand and another table a little larger that had a phone on it with rather wilty Carnations. There was a rolling rack with some hangers on it that was along the wall and a small TV in a cabinet. The TV did have a remote and I did not have to pay a deposit for it. On top of the TV was a clock radio with alarm. The bedspread and window draperies were of good quality fabric and design. The bathroom was rather large considering the size of the sleeping room. Lovely tile with a pedestal sink. Very clean with the exception of some of the grout lines in the shower. However I have stayed at $300 a night rooms that have been worse. Had I been traveling with my husband, he would not have appreciated the adventure and would have been very unhappy here. Yet, had we received this exact same room in Europe during a vacation, I think he would have been fine. Again, all in the expectations or preconceived ideas we have.This hotel was perfect for what I purchased it for; an overnight stay. The common rooms were small but nice and has previously been said, coffee and tea were always available for free. All things considered, I would rather stay in a small room with a lot of charm (few amities, but lots of charm) than a larger room in a non descript chain hotel.

<Content>Nice Little Gem I stayed here a while ago and made some petty complaints about outside noise and such (street noise and there was construction going on...no fault of the hotel's). This was my first time in San Fran and have since stayed at other hotels in the city around the same price range. I have discovered that this hotel is the best for your buck. I't's clean, very cozy, centrally-located and cheap. Plus, the staff is very friendly. I have learned my lesson, Edwardian. I think I can deal with a little bit of street noise for the value. I would definitely like to come back.

There was no problem at all and my room was upgraded for a very reasonable fee. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. being right off Market St it was noisy outside, but certainly not unreasonable. The service was very good and friendly. I would certainly stay at the Edwardian again on my next visit to San Francisco.

<Content>nice little place close to everything This hotel was great for a two night stay. My friend and I have only two complaints one is there were no washclothes in the bathroom and the cleaning lady when we asked did not have any on her cart, so we had to go to walgreens and purchase 2 of them for our own use. The second one is about orbitz and the lack of choice as to what kind of room you can book, so we ended up with one bed and my friend got that and I was on the floor, but I am used to sleeping on the floor and so that was not really a problem as I was not there for the second night so did not have to worry about sleeping on the floor. But over all the whole place was great, we got in a little late but the front desk person named clayton was very helpful as to where to park ( note to people there is a pay lot on the corner of oak and not sure of the other name, but it is $5.00 for 12 hours of parking.) Also this hotel is NOT THE RITZ and should be given a chance, just because of it's location does not mean it is bad.

<Content>v. helpful staff The hotel is very conveniently located on market street within walking distance (a mi.) of museums, theatre and the financial district. It is also right in front of a tram stop, which is a huge plus. My only beef was that I booked my reservation at Expedia and was a bit disappointed that the room was one with a shared bath and WC. This important detail didn't stand out while making the reservation; esp. if you consider that Expedia has the Edwardian rated as 2-1/2 star which it in all fairness really isn't. This is a screwup on Expedia's part however as they need to make sure their ratings are more fair and balanced because I was certainly charged higher room rates by them as per the higher rating.The manager at the Edwardian, Aziz, was however quite considerate when I pointed this out to him and bumped the room to a bigger bed and bath for the 2 nights out of 4 that he had availability for no extra charge at all. If you are just looking for a place to crash and a great, easy-access location, this is a nice choice. I would also make reservations with the hotel directly for possibly better rates. And two definite thumbs up for a friendly staff.

Heating non-existent as it must be turned on by person at the front desk with no in room adjustment.When presented with the problems the schmarmy hotel manager tried to not confront the issues, did offer to switch rooms for me, but since the problems are systemic this was not really an option. Only by applying huge pressure from [--] did I get a refund.

<Content>Edwardian convenient location yet off the tourist track The Edwardian is conveniently located on Market Street. It will taken you 5 minutes to get to Union Square by the F Market trolley, if that's where you are headed. Yet, it is close to the residential neighborhoods and has easy access to the Haight, Golden Gate Park, the Mission, and other areas where the locals and more seasoned travelers go.Rooms are comfortable and offer shared or private baths, internet and two comfotable sitting rooms in a typical Edwardian style building. Staff are friendly and helpful and very familiar with San Francisco.

<Content>Terrible hotel... I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights at the end of December 2006 and had one of the worst hotel experiences in my life!Would not recommend this hotel for anything but its location (which is convenient).I had a single tiny room, with old furniture (partly) falling apart. It had a horrible cigarette smell which would not go away.Most importantly, the first day I was there, didn't have any hot water in my room! Also, the heating wasn't working and believe me, the outside temperature was really low... Despite mentionning this problem several times to the hotel manager, it was not fixed before the 4th day of my stay, which made it totally unpleasant and uncomfortable.Also, one day, my room was not tidied up. And another day, the elevator did not work (I stayed on the 4th floor).Everytime I (rightfully) complained about problems to the manager, he looked really annoyed... So my advice: don't go there, it's certainly not worse the price you will pay. And don't believe the positive reviews you may find here, which I believe are all complete lie... This hotel is not even worse a 1 star hotel...

I arrived early, but was still allowed to check in and was also moved to a room with free Wi-Fi when asked. There's a Trolley Car stop right out front that travels between The Castro area and Fisherman's Wharf so that took care of where I needed to go. Public Transport in SF is cheap and well run, the complete opposite of LA.During the day I would catch the trolley downtown for sight seeing and then at night catch it up to Castro for dinner and drinks.

<Content>Don't go there if you have a car We arrived quite late in the evening by car, and it was difficult even to stop by the hotel to ask about the parking. We ended up parking around the block (probably illegally), and were advised that the hotel guests can use a parking lot a few blocks away. The area is full of homeless, and when we found the parking lot it was empty and we did not feel secure leaving the car there by itself. However, we didn't have much other choice as there was no supervised parking in the area. When we booked the hotel through Venere, the information was that the hotel has a garage. This is not true. Unloading the luggage is also quite difficult as there is nowhere to stop outside the hotel. The hotel has carpets both in the hallways and in the rooms, and these seem so old that they really do not feel clean. So even if the room probably was clean it felt quite dusty. There is no ventilation and as others have mentioned it's impossible to open the windows... well you can, but they are old and quite dangerous. The bathrooms are large, but the appliances (hairdryer) did not really look usable. The location was ok; it's central, but full of homeless. They are not dangerous, but I would not rate this as the best neighborhood. Going around from the hotel was easy because of the tram and buses stopping just outside the hotel entrance.

<Content>Excellent Service and Great Location I've stayed here 4 or 5 times over the past few years and have always been glad I did. The location is great and the rooms are clean and well maintained. David and his staff are courteous and very friendly. On my last trip I left something behind which they found and sent back to me, then called to follow up. Top notch!

<Content>Came for a night; stayed the whole week I came to San Francisco to look for an apartment and figured I would stay one night at a hotel, and then move into a weekly rental place after that. But the Edwardian is centrally located and the management was terrifcally accomodating, so I ended up staying the whole week at the Edwardian while apartment hunting. I love the European feel to the place. Only bad thing is some construction is going on off the back of the hotel, but it's not a big deal. Hotel was great, found my apartment, all worked out...

<Content>excellent value and service I originally checked in to a hotel that turned out to be a nightmare (cockroaches, etc.) and decided to move to the Edwardian.David the manager was extremely friendly and helpful. He gave me a free room upgrade and put me in a room with wireless access when he saw my laptop. The room and bathroom were clean and nicely decorated.For the price, quality, location and service, I think this hotel would be hard to beat.

<Content>Nice little gem As a journalist I travel quite a bit. I checked out the reviews of the edwardian on this site but decided to check it out anyway. So with some trepidation I checked into the hotel. I found this charming little hotel to be a hidden gem in the city. The staff were both gregarious and informative. I opted to take the cheapest room and even though it is small(it does have a double bed)I found it to be tastefully decorated and very clean. The hotel has a coffee bar for free and reading rooms on every floor. For those of you that like a french style pension or country Inn this is the place to stay! Very reasonable rates and located on an upscale part of market street(not the area with all the homeless) it is convienent to public trans and all the tourist sites that san fran has to offer. Of course with any stay there are always some things one would like to be different. For me if they offered larger bars of soap for the shower and herbal teas besides the black tea it would be grand. I would highly recomend this hotel to anyone looking for a great deal in san fran.

<Content>A wonderfull stay My familly came in from Washington D.C. They stayed at the Edwardian Hotel since it is located in the heart of San Francisco. It is very convenient, close to all the shops, attractions, and transportation.The rooms are clean and cozy, the service was outstanding, and the price was reasonable comparing it to other European style hotels.I will definetly recommend this place and I will bring all my visitors. Matter of fact, my girlfreind and I are planing to spend the night there for her birthday.Sam

<Content>Terrible Experience; Refused to Stay ANY review of this hotel that is above 1-Star is VERY SUSPECT!!!!Booked this thru [-----------] based on pictures/review saying it was a 鈥淓uropean boutique style hotel鈥? First bad sign was that the front door was locked and it wasn鈥檛 even 5:00 p.m.; after front desk clerk finally opened door, he was rude and condescending. Elevator was scary; felt for sure we were going to get stuck. Room on the third floor overlooking Market Street (truly the busiest street in S.F.) so it was loud, cold (no heat and it was February), no closet but a metal rack shoved beside bed. Bathroom was ok but that was it. After my husband asked me if I thought they rented this room 鈥渂y the hour鈥?that was all I needed to get out of there. However, this was after we clearly heard a drug deal and solicitation going on down on the street even though we were on the 3rd floor!Called front desk to ask for money back (we had booked / prepaid for two nights) was told no, they refused to give a refund and the clerk was extremely rude. We then called 鈥淗otels鈥?and advised that this location misrepresented itself on the web site and that it was a dangerous, unsafe environment. The DID refund our money and offered to find another hotel for us and even called a Cab to pick us up.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay I stayed at the Edwardian for two weeks. I would use it again and would recommend it to friends. Caveat: I imagine each room is different. I like what I got!- weekly rate was negotiable esp. when I had already explored other nearby places and let them know I was looking at them.- bathroom clean, new- high-speed wireless internet though it did not cover the entire hotel. Seemed to be best near the front common areas on each floor.- Old World charm including a very special elevator that holds old paintings in frames on its walls.- Place was clean, quiet- Bed was average or better than average- Cable TV (though a few stations were fuzzy until I moved the tv a bit).- location is pretty good, though after dark there's little quick/fast food open nearby. But that stuff isn't a far walk. Lots happening up Van Ness which is only a few blocks away. Transit very easy to get to.- staff were friendly.CON- no mini fridges or microwaves in the rooms I saw.- no pop/soda/snack machines that I could see.- shower a bit weak- my room (#34), while having a nice view, faced SOMETHING that gave off a whole lot of cigarette smoke! I believe it was the fancy restaurant below the window. So I kept the window closed. I never noticed the smoke smell w the window closed.- room was small but nicely done.
