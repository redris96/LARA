<Content>great location lovely hotel My mother and I found that this hotel exceeded all our expectations. All staff were more than helpful and the location is the best of Mexico City. Rooms are very spacious and clean. The bar at the penthouse with the swimming pool is very nice and the breakfast is good. The gym equipment is a little bit old but everything worked. We would return without hesitation.

<Content>Great location but rock hard beds! I have stayed in lots of moderately priced hotels in big cities and the number one thing we look for is... location! This hotel is a great base camp if you plan on spending most of your time exploring the city. It's a 2 minute walk to the metro stop Insurgentes on the pink line and almost anything you might want to do in the city can be accessed via the metro. However, Mexico City is HUGE so things seem closer than they really are. There are mediocre restaurants in the hotel, but with several Sanborns and Vips neaby, there's really no reason to eat in the hotel even if you're not adventurous enough to look for other more authentic places to eat. It's a short walk to the Independence Angel and strolling along the Paseo de la Reforma is a nice way to digest dinner. There's a good indoor market nearby that opens at 10 am for picking up souvenirs and other crafts. And just as an FYI, you are right down the street from a bunch of gay bars, so the area is very lively at night and there's lots of PDA around. If you are a homophobe unfamiliar with metropolitan areas or are travelling with young children who are kept sheltered, this might be a problem for you. As for the hotel itself- it is a large hotel and there isn't a whole lot of personal service. The area overall is a little noisy, after all, you are downtown in a big city with a lot of police presence. There is adequate space in the room and bathroom - in fact, by European standards, the place is huge! The views are nice - better from the upper floors, of course. The room decor is hideous and the pool is tiny - but if you're rarely in your room or swim, who cares? Probably my only complaint is the the beds are the hardest I've slept on in my life and the pillows are like sacks of old heavy clothes. If we choose not to stay there again, that will be the only reason why. (Oh, and my daughter Shelby just reminded me that the toilet got clogged and there wasn't enough shampoo.)Taxis are not nearly as cost-prohibitive as in other cites so even if you don't choose to take the metro (it does get ridiculously crowded), it's still a great base camp. We travelled with a 4, 7, and an 11 year old and you can ride in a special section on the metro with kids. Definitely visit the Zocalo, Chapultepec Park (especially the palace and museum of Anthropology), the Basilica of Guadalupe and Xochimilco. And take a day trip to the pyramids. Off the beaten path is the Leon Trotsky house that he lived and was murdered in after his exile from Russia and the Freida Kahlo and Diego Rivera home - very educational and worthwhile. But even 6 days was not enough to see enough of this amazing city - we'll be back. All in all, this hotel was a good value and we had a great time in Mexico City. But if you're a traveller who needs more plush accomodations and hangs out in your hotel, you might want to spend a little more.

<Content>Heatless Desk Clerks I just returned with my family and another family - friends of ours who stayed in the room next door. We all woke up yesterday morning and were covered in mosquito bites! My family was not affected as much as our friends were - one of their sons had 45 bites on his head and face alone! The rest of the family had literally dozens of bites all over their bodies and were unable to sleep all night. When they went to the front desk to show them their condition and to request a different room, the desk clerk simply told them that all the rooms have a mosquito problem and she would send someone to take care of it. After a housekeeper showed up and sprayed bug spray in the room, they thought the problem was resolved. After another night of being eaten by the mosquitos, we all checked out this morning. When my friend asked for some sort of discount due to their lack of sleep both nights and the welts all over their bodies, the clerk (the same lady as the night before) just said No. There was not even an apology to these toddlers who had to suffer with all these bug bites. Immediately when I got home I called Best Western's 800 Customer Service number and spoke to an equally rude service agent who basically told me that there was nothing she could do either. I have a trip scheduled for later this week at a different Best Western, but I am going to cancel because chains that do not care about what happens to their customers do not deserve my business.

<Content>Loved it! I was traveling with a tour group so I really didn't have a choice in picking this hotel, but I really liked it. My room was on the 15th floor and I had a fabulous view. The room was very spacious, very clean, and very modern. My stay was for 4 nights. I ate breakfast there every day and the breakfast buffet was very good. I also ate dinner in the restaurant 3 of the 4 nights and it was also very good. The rooftop bar is very nice and the bartender made an excellent margarita. There is 24 hour complimentary coffee in the rooftop bar. The front desk and restaurant personnel were all very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again.

<Content>Convenient location, good for first trip to Mexico City Our travel agent booked this hotel for us so we didn't know what to expect. This is a standard 3-4 star hotel, and I mean standard. We had a standard room, which we found clean and comfortable. There was a fridge, mini bar, safe in the room.The location of this hotel is great. It is in the centre of zona rosa with lots of eating places nearby. We used the subway to get around in the daytime, and the nearest stop is 2 mins walk from the hotel. We didn't eat in the restaurant as it was expensive, there are plenty of places nearby for breakfast/lunch and dinner.If you are just after a comfortable, clean, safe place to stay in Mexico City this is the place.Be aware of the travel agency based in this hotel. We were charged twice for a tour on our credit card (and this is yet to be resolved).

<Content>Cheap but not chic I stayed at the Hotel Royal last week, having flown in from London via Miami. We finally arrived and the staff at reception weren't terribly interested in helping us, and after a 15 hour trip all we wanted to do was get to our room.When we finally got to our room it was pretty grim. On my double bed I only had one pillow case, and the other pillow was uncovered and covered in dubious stains, as was one of the sheets. Eugh. The bathroom was grotty and needed a thorough clean. The hotel may be cheap but they could at least give you a clean room.I hardly slept due to the highway outside and the police sirens up and down the street. Breakfast the next day was interesting - it made my old school food like like Michelin star quality food. Tasteless eggs, rock solid 'pancakes' and bitter coffee.We were due to stay another night there - we cancelled and stayed at the Hotel Emporio, which was more expensive but so much better.

<Content>If you must... but skip the breakfast If you choose to stay here, take advantage of the acceptable services and facilities, but skip the hotel breakfast- I recommend instead walking a block to La Casa de La Enchilada on Liverpool to pay 50% of the price for double the quality.

<Content>Definitely Stay Again I have recently returned from a four week holiday travelling all around Mexico with my husband. Our trip started with a three night stay in Mexico City and I must say, for all the people who tried to convince us not to include Mexico City in our itinerary, I am really glad that we didn't listen to you.After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, like many of the other hotels, you often wonder if everyone has actually stayed in the same hotel.Briefly:* Yes, the beds were a little hard, but we still found them very comfortable.* The rooms were a good size.* As far as the major highway goes, we didn't even know it was there. As soon as we were dropped off at the hotel late in the evening, we were told, that when you leave the hotel, ALWAYS turn right and never left. I guess this is why we didn't notice the highway.* I really appreciated that you could access the internet for free from the lobby.* We didn't have much to do with the staff in general, but when we did, we found them helpful.* We loved the location and found it very easy to get around and not once, did we ever feel uneasy when walking in the area.* The restaurant was pretty average in our opinion and we thought that breakfast was ordinary and over priced for what it was. There are so many other options for eating and drinking in the area.* FYI: You might like to know, that yes it is in a gay area with nightclubs and bars.Would we stay here again - most definitely.

<Content>great hotel, shame about the staff The hotel has clean, comfortable rooms and a beautiful restaurant and lobby. Unfortunately it is on the corner of a massive highway and surrounded by dilapidated buildings- however this is what a lot of central Mexico City looks like. The restaurant staff were friendly and wonderful and the food was tasty and was of mostly American cuisine. The reception staff were a different story. Unfriendly, unwilling to help and at times refusing to order a radio taxi or tell us whether places were safe to visit or not! Beware- one of the leading ladies at reception, Maria, was particularly rude and we ended up going to the Sheraton to use their concierge to get around Mexico City!

<Content>Good but expensive This hotel is located right in the middle of the zona rosa in Mexico City. The hotel deserves the 4* rating, nevertheless, compared to other hotels around the world it seems to be rater expensive.The rooms are above average, they are huge and the hotel offers free Wi-Fi or free broadband acces to the internet in every room.The breakfast buffet has been average, while the guys at the reception have been very helpful and friendly.There is also a very small pool at the upper floor.From my point of view, this is a solid option for a business traveler, if you are on vacation or if you look for a more unique hotel, look for other options.

<Content>A great oasis Staying at the Hotel Royak in the Zona Rosa of Mexico City is a near perfect experience. As a business traveller the HR is excellent quality for price, friendly, delightful stay with spacious comfortable rooms, excellent meals with two restaurants (one with a breakfast buffet). For the cigar smokers, there is a cigar bar attached with high quality low price Royal brand cigars. Free internet (either wireless or wired, depending on the room). An excellent indoor-outdoor penthouse bar and even a gym and pool.What is not to love. A secure ATM about fifty feet down the block.Walk outside and you immediately understand the oasis concept. Zona Rosa, at one time a great tourist district has become everything that you may not want, especially as a solo traveller. Sleezy harassment every step of evey block. Out on the street after 6:00 PM is a major challenge. Dive for one of the secure taxis and you are fine, but you better make sure it is secure.One fatiques of this very quickly.If you plan to come to Mexico City for business and you have to stay in the Zona Rosa area, this is a great place to stay.

<Content>For $74 a night, a good deal I was able to get a $74 per night rate on Orbitz, a savings over the rack rate which was around $124. The hotel is located close to a metro stop. I used the metro to get around town during the day; clean, easy to navigate, quick and safe (just be aware of your surroundings as you should be in any large city). It is also centrally located so you can walk to other areas of town, if you are an urban walker. Zona Rosa was not very quaint but not objectionable. There are restaurants and bars within walking distance. As mentioned in other reviews, the beds were very firm but not uncomfortable, in my opinion. One benefit of staying in a hotel with many rooms (about 160, if I remember correctly) was that I was able to check-in early after a red-eye flight. I imagine that smaller hotels are far less likely to have empty, available rooms at 6:30 am. All in all, I was pleased by the location and cleanliness of the Royal Zona Rosa... especially for the price I paid.

<Content>Beware of the other things! We stayed at the Royal hotel as a group of 8 accomadating 4 rooms (3 doubles and 2 singles). The hotel was clean and very tidy, and the hotel staff were very nice and helpful. This hotel is situated only 2 minutes walk from the famous silver markets of the Zona Rosa. There is a huge amount of toursit security in the Zona Rosa and as a group felt very safe walking the streets at night. We were all enjoying our stay except for one HUGE sore point which ruined our experience of Mexico city. The sore point was a tour company (VIAJES PREMIER,S.A.) operating in the lobby of the hotel, I would suggest you ensure you get a receipt for what you pay for and make sure what is included is contained on the receipt and not just the total you have paided or you may find yourself going on one of those infamous Mexican tours. The guide picked us up in a van, did a couple of circles of the same block of buildings, then took us to a Mariachi restaurant with an all inclusive deal. Then when we wanted to leave the restaurant, the staff handed us a bill for the night out. No way out of it we had to pay, and as the hotel is not responsible we left with somewhat lighter wallets and a promise to never return to this hotel due to this experience.

<Content>Great location, call a chiropractor Just returned from spending one week in Mexico City; the first three nights at the Royal Zona Rosa. If you are planning to get around Mexico City using the Metro (highly recommended) then the Royal Zona Rosa is an excellent location, right across the street from the Insurgentes Metro station. It's also centrally located within easy walking distance all of the shops and restaurants of the Zona Rosa area. The room was clean and the water was hot with excellent pressure (not always the case in Mexico as a quick check of many reviews on this site will atest). The shower curtain, however, was installed so that it was impossible for water not to flood the bathroom floor. Luckily, there was a drain in the middle of the floor, but it still meant standing in some water until housekeeping did their thing. A word of caution: the beds are hard as rocks. The room was equipped with two queen-sized beds, and both were equally uncomfortable. I'm not sure that the floor wouldn't have been softer. After three nights, we moved to the Hotel Maria Cristina, where the beds were much more comfortable.All-in-all, a good hotel, though if you're willing to walk a few blocks more to get to the Metro and shops, I think there are better values to be had in the area.

<Content>Great stay at great hotel We stayed at this hotel for 1 night in Jan 2006 and it was really good. The room was really spacious and they had already made up the extra fold out bed for us (3 singles staying in a double room) before we arrived. Everything was better than expected including the breakfast buffet which had a wide variety of things.The hotel recommended a taxi driver who spoke english to take us to the sun and moon pyramids and it was awesome! There is a small pool and garden area on the top story of the building which would be nice to relax in, but is quite small. Overall we were really impressed with this hotel and would recommend it for any stay in Mexico City!

<Content>Clueless staff, corporate rooms As soon as we arrived there were problems with the staff here, who were unfriendly, unhelpful and had no knowledge of our booking. After about an hour, in which they had not even invited us to sit in the lobby, they finally gave us a room, but at a higher rate. It had a terrible view of other rooms and was decorated in a completely uninspired style. The television did not work. Though the small roof top pool is nice, I would not recommend this hotel at all. It's a five-star hotel and you expect a better standard of service than what we were given.

<Content>A Great find! My wife and I decided to spend an extra day in D.F. and picked this hotel on a whim, because of the location. The staff was one of the most accomodating I have ever come across! The hotel is in the heart of the Zona Rosa district, and steps from the Metro (we found the Metro much more efficient than driving in taxis, and is only 2 pesos...) Easy access to the Archaelogical Museum and Zocalo. The whole hotel is up-to-date and clean. Our room was large, and well decorated. The staff went out of their way to be helpful, and even managed to retrieve a bag that we left in a taxi! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel... It's a steal for the price...
