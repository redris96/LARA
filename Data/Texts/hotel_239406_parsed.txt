<Content>Smallest bathroom EVER The location of the hotel was good, not too close to the busy streets and not noisy. However, if you look at the website the bedrooms look lovely and are certainly what you expect to get when you arrive,especially as we had booked our 3 night stay a few months in advance. Unfortunately, by the time we got from the Airport to the Hotel (early afternoon) we got the last room in the Hotel (apparently), which had been rejected by the previous arrivals. Room 232 is better suited to a single occupant and isn't really a double. As they say not enough room to swing a cat in. Bathroom was very narrow and when brushing your teeth your bum could touch the other wall (ps. and it wasn't because we are huge). Make sure you take a hairdryer as the one in the bathroom is definitely been there since the 60's or 70's and takes an age to make any impact. Breakfast is basic, but adequate. Staff were pleasant and helpful where they could be.The restaurant Mimmo's as previously mentioned by fellow travellers which is just around the corner is definitely worth a visit, home made chips were great!

<Content>Nice place in Florence Hotel Cimabue was a nice place to stay in a central location in Florence. Clean and effecient and reasonably priced. I will recommend it to other travelers going to italy.

<Content>Hated the Cimabue Saw the web page and had a recommendation from our travel planner-plus the brochure looked good. A 12 room family run hotel  recently renovated. Our room was definitely not redone recently. The shower was in the bedroom where a closet may have been and old- moldy, cracked tile, with a calsifed shower head. Really a joke. The door lock needed repair, a light bulb was burned out in one reading lamp, the breakfast was marginal, no ice at the bar, and when we checked out they tried to get us to pay in cash. Three stars on the sign - but they should have to give up two at least.

<Content>Actually 2 and a half stars Hotel Cimabue, it appears, was a 2 star hotel until the last few years, as a booking site still displays the plate with 2 stars. I feel that they installed air conditioning and in-room safe boxes and managed to qualify as 3 star. That is to say that all the rest remains 2 stars, including the bed, the bath, furniture , breakfast, and luckily, the price. I can say this with ease, as I have seen a total of 8 hotels in Italy; 2, 3, and 4 stars included. If you are looking for the comfort of a 2 star hotel, Hotel Cimabue is fine, if you pay just a bit more than a 2 star hotel. But if like us, you would like to make use of a 3 star hotel, be prepared to pay 20-25 euros more, and you can get a really good room. This is what we did, we arrived near midnight, checked in, stayed there for 1 night, but in the morning we searched for and booked another hotel. With some effort, we were able to convince the staff at the Hotel Cimabue to charge us the night we stayed and cancel the rest of the reservation.Refurbished 19th century building gives the feeling of an authentic and nostalgic atmosphere, but actually it is only an old building that has been repaired. After this hotel, it has been possible for us to find an albergo in the second floor of a 18th century palazzo, very close to the center. That was what I would consider the ambience of a refurbished 19th century building, Hotel Cimabue has nothing to do with it.Our room was not very clean; the sheets were OK, but the furniture was really dusty. The smeared mosquito on the wall together with a footprint is a plus.Surroundings are a bit lonely at night, though it is possible to walk to the touristic attraction sites like Duomo in 10 minutes.

<Content>Many concerns We stayed in Hotel Cimabue on the 27th and 28th of July. It had blood splats and smears on the walls in both rooms our group stayed in from squashed mosquitos. Our 1 year old baby was given a cot (once we reminded them we'd booked it) without a base so you could feel all the metal frame through the matress. The breakfast we had ran out of milk and cereal and had stale crossaints. We actually stayed at this hotel based on the feedback on trip advisor from previous guests. My advice is find a hotel closer to the centre of Florence and avoid this hotel.

<Content>Mosquito Central The hotel in general is okay but there is one major problem - Mosquitos. The room I stayed in had a trap door for a water tank which didn't close properly and which presumably served as a breeding ground for the large number of mozzies in the room. To make matters worse the staff did nothing when the matter was pointed out to them. Previous occupants had squatted insects and these plastered the walls. Again they were not cleaned when the staff''s attention was drawn to them.Do not stay here you will be eaten alive!

<Content>Not what I had hoped for We stayed just one night at Cimabue, but it was not a good one. The rooms we stayed in was very small and the bathroom was tiny. The shower had mildew and there was a hair in the soap dish. The breakfast was fair. I won't ever stay there again. The only good things were the great water pressure in the shower and the coffee was good. Service was fair.

<Content>Not what we expected We searched for the best bang for our buck based on reviews. The hotel was also offering a March discount for rooms booked online and the deal seemed too good to be true.The breakfast area was quaint and they do serve up some great coffee. I used their laptop for internet access but some of the buttons did not work well. I was better off in one of the many internet cafes in the area.The room was very dated and worn. The shower showed it's wear with mildew and chipped tiles. The curtains seemed dingy and the furniture needed some leveling.The staff was helpful but their absence on the morning we were checking out caused us delays. No one, it seemed, showed up for work. That is until the manager's son came in and opened shoppe.For the ridiculously cheap price we paid, it was a place to lay your head down for the night.

<Content>You won't be disappointed At just 拢40 BB per night my expectations weren't very high but this lovely hotel was a real find. In a quiet street just a 5 minute walk from the Duomo and Accademia, rooms were spotlessly clean and classically furnished. The staff were friendly, welcoming and more than willing to help with museum reservations, restaurant recommendations, taxis, etc. I stayed for 2 nights and would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a short break, but they also offer organised trips to surrounding cities so this could be the perfect base for a longer stay in Tuscany.I hope to go back to Florence one day and will definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Disgusting, rude and noisy We could not believe how bad this hotel was. It was extremely noisy and they wouldn't move us. There are mice and the shower was only a half size - a triangle!!! We discussed these issues with the owner who brushed us off - couldn't care less and was very rude, in fact made insulting comments about our religion. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else.

<Content>Warm and Hospitable Igino and Regis Rossi run the charming Hotel Cimabue. They are friendly, helpful and warm. The hotel is situated near Piazza San Marco, close to the museum which houses Michaelangelo's David, but it is not as central to the other attractions as I would have liked. However, the advantage is that the hotel is quiet and charming. The rooms are sweet. But the real reason to go here is for the friendly hospitality.Enjoyed my stay very much.

<Content>Excellent home base in Florence The Hotel Cimabue is a great place to call home while visiting Florence. It's inside the old city and everything I wanted to see is within a comfortable walking distance (and I was recovering from surgery on my knee from a ski accident). I liked the size of the establishment because it was big enough to be a full service hotel, yet small enough to be intimate and familiar. The staff was genuinely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable in answering questions. I loved the cappuccino every morning with my breakfast and I could choose from a variety of selections to eat and drink. This was all included in the fee. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, clean and safe. I'm recommending it to my best friends who are planning to visit the area!

<Content>Good value at the Hotel Cimabue We booked two rooms at the Cimabue - a triple and a quad. Both were very good and quite spacious for European hotels. The ceiling of the quad was very nice. Good breakfast and very nice folks manning the desk!! If you don't mind the 12 minute walk to the Duomo, you can save some serious cash by staying at the Cimabue. Well done!

<Content>Hospitality and Comfort...A plus We traveled (15 of us) for 12 days in Italy and our best hotel and stay was here. the staff coudln't be nicer. We stayed in a quadruple with beautiful ceilings...Excellent location and great cappucino. It was nice to meet other travelers in the breakfast room in the morning as well as at night..Mr. Rossi and his handsome son were really helpful. They'll make reservations for you at the museums if you tell them in advance....

<Content>Friendly, Helpful Hotel, good location My sister and I stayed at the Hotel Cimabue earlier this month and found it to be a great find. Regis and his father will take great care of you--they were very helpful in getting museum reservations, restaurant recommendations, etc... The breakfast was perfect to start your morning and the breakfast room was great in the evening to come back to for a hot chocolate or drink after walking the Florence streets. Our room was simple, clean, quiet. The bathroom was small, but fine. We actually walked to the hotel from the train station, toting our luggage, and it took about 20 minutes. We also were able to walk to just about everything from the hotel. It is not right in the middle of all the central museums, etc... But close enough. We would stay there again.

<Content>We liked Hotel Cimabue We picked this one off the web for its combination of price and location. Our room was old and not very up to date, but large, clean and very adequate. We went in March, so keeping warm or cool was not a problem. Toilet and shower up to date. My bed was ok, but my adult daughter said hers was hard. Breafkast was good. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They reccommended 2 trattorias nearby which we liked so much we alternated between the 2 for dinner each night. They also reccommended a bus tour to Siena when we mentioned we wanted to go there. It also included San Gimigiano. I usually avoid tours since I like to set my own pace, but this one was worth while. Location of hotel was good, within walking distance (I am a healthy 80) of Duomo, Piti Palace and Uffizi for us. While Distance from train station was not great, took Taxis rather than try to get there with luggage.

<Content>Friendly Staff - Loud Hotel The staff at this hotel was exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was very good.Our room, however, was on the first floor, and the noise of people coming in at all hours of the night and at breakfast time was overwhelming. My husband and I were absolutely exhausted from not sleeping well during our five-night stay at Hotel Cimabue.I am a light sleeper, but my husband is not. When he started complaining about the noise, I knew it was bad.
