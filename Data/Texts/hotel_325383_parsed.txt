<Content>Awesome - top notch My husband and I splurged on The Bale for our honeymoon and spent 3 nights over the new year here. From the time you arrive, you feel like you're in paradise. The design of The Bale is minimalistic and modern. I love the simple design of the rooms, and yet they have attap roofs to retain some Balinese feel.The LCD TV is placed strategically across the bed, which makes it good for viewing movies. This is not a given at some of the other villas I went to in Bali (though they are of course, of a different price range). It also comes with a DVD player which has a USB port and we managed to watch some movies which we saved on the thumb drive (in .avi format).There are 2 shower areas and I loved the outdoor shower. The water tasted a bit salty though! I'm not sure where it's from... The bathtub was slightly small but also well designed (tap with feet to plug in the stopper and tap to plug out). There was also a small LCD TV at the bathtub.We were in villa 30 which had the bath area lead directly to the swimming pool. The pool was small, not really for swimming, more for soaking and sunbathing. There was a bigger swimming pool in the compound which we didn't get to go. Beside the swimming pool is a pavillion where you get served breakfast, and for us, our candlelight dinner. The daybed at the pavillion was very comfortable for relaxing and I could still use wifi at the pavillion.The candlelight dinner was so-so, but service was great as usual. We loved breakfast! The menu was interesting and we could order as much as we wanted - which was fun on the first day, but by the last day, we only ordered quite little. The Fried Noodles is a must try! We had it on all three days. The juices were also good. The egg omelette was pretty normal. One thing to note about inroom breakfast, is that the portions get reduced by alot! We managed to order 1 Fried Noodles which was sufficient for 2 to share in Faces Restaurant, but inroom, it was only enough for 1 person. The juices also get halved.The service at The Bale was impeccable. We had the drivers drive us to eat local food (Mee soto, sate, babi guling), to the beach, The Bali Collection, a local pasar which were within fifteen minutes of the villa. We stayed one night in Ubud prior to staying at The Bale and had done our shopping in Ubud and on the way down to Nusa Dua. It is best to enjoy the villa rather than have the drivers drive you down to Kuta (crazy traffic jams) or spend the full day outdoors visiting the volcanos etc. You don't really get your money's worth IMO if you spend the whole day out.We had a great stay at The Bale and will definitely be back on our anniversary!

<Content>Great Service...So Relaxed!! Less than 30 villas at The Bale, u hardly see other guests in the complex except for the attendants, feels like u r the owner of the whole complex!!Nice attendants, service was great. But keep in mind that transfer service might not be on time, sometimes 10-15 mins late.On the 1st day, I stayed at No.20 villa, it overlook the whole complex from the top, so it got a great view. However, I can say it's a villa to see and to be seen, people can see u if u stay in the garden. So we moved to No.17 where we got more privacy. What's more, the pool is attached to the bathroom @17, so we can jump right off the pool from our room.U should definately try to order in room breakfast. They would set a table beside the pool for u to enjoy the great food.The sand  the water condition @ the beach club was just so-so, not a nice place for swimming, but it's a gd for beginner surfer.

<Content>Good but.... My wife and I ended our honeymoon in Indonesia with 4 nights at the Bal茅. It was our second hotel in Bali (first was the Viceroy in Ubud). The hotel is really modern and well built. We booked a superior villa and it was wonderful : very confortable, well equiped, very nice private pool etc etc But ....I have had the luck to stay at great hotels. What make the difference is in the details : first we waited 2 hours on arrival to have our room (ok... it can happen), we asked for a nice restaurant and we were sent to a on the beach restaurant where the food was not good. Breakfast was average etc etc, we noticed that the hotel is not as clean as it seems.To sum up: Fantastic room, friendly staff (even if not very efficient), good restaurant (not the b.f. though).... but the hotel is sleeping on its reputation (if we compare to the Viceroy where everything was premium - with a same price range) and there's nothing to do in the area (the beach is not pretty). My advise is to forget the south part of Bali (where all the tourists go). The beaches will only make surfers happy, there's nothing interesting to do in the area, and it's too crowdy. On the other end, Ubud was really amazing and I have heard that the north part of the island is becoming really interesting.

<Content>Wonderful! We had a wonderful stay at the Bale and stayed in a single pavillion (number 8) for 5 nights. Our room was very spacious and airy - the design is very sleek and minimalist but it is still very comfortable/simple and not at all like at all like those ultra-modern design hotels where you can never find the light switch! The bathroom was big and very nicely designed, complete with indoor and outdoor showers. We loved the steps down into our pool from the sliding bathroom doors. The private pool was lovely and it is a decent size as private pools go and there is plenty of private outdoor space. The single pavillions do not have sun loungers but there are deckchairs and there is also a double daybed outside for relaxing (but it has a roof over it so you can't use it for sunbathing). Our garden/pool got the sun for most of the day (until about 4pm) but the downside was that we were quite near the main road - there is a constant stream of traffic which means it is not very relaxing or condusive to mid-afternoon snoozing! At the main pool, we couldn't hear the traffic so it is probably worth asking for a room that is higher up in the complex. The main pool is a good size for swimming (about 20 metres) and it never feels crowded as most people seem to stay in their pavillions during the day or go to the beach club. The Bale's private beach club is very nice with loungers and umbrellas and attendants to bring you towels/drinks etc. - the hotel will drive you down and it only takes about 5 minutes to get there. The beach is not very wide but it has lovely yellow sand and the water is clear and turquoise (much nicer than the beaches at Kuta/Seminyak). There is some seaweed washed up on the beach but The Bale clear it away from their section of sand! The Bale's spa is really nice and most of the treatment rooms have big jacuzzis for private use after treatments. The treatments are fairly expensive by Balineese standards (about $60 for a 1 hour massage plus 21% tax/service) but the therapists were very good. We had breakfast in our pavillion every morning (at no charge which is a nice touch) and the food was great - there is a good selection and plenty of different things to try over the course of a few days. The staff are very pleasant and are happy to arrange anything on your behalf. The hotel offers free transfers to any restaurant in Tanjung/Nusa Dua and Jimbaran, which is a great service and we used this every night - we found Bumbu in Tanjung to be one of the better places nearby. They have great Indonesian food and a decent wine list in terms of both selection and prices (rare in Bali). We were disappointed by PJs at the Four Seasons in Jimbaran - beautiful setting on the beach but the food is not exceptional and the wine list is extortionate (for imported wines, prices start at around $80). It is definitely worth going to the Amanusa hotel (next door to The Bale) for a sunset drink as the setting is really beautiful.

<Content>A cool place to recover from jetlag The good: This property is architecturally gorgeous and well-designed, with a fabolous pool surrounded by day-beds and perfectly placed for a sneek view of the ocean that is some distance away. The rooms are equally-well designed and comfortable, with an adequate seating area and beautiful bathrooms. The staff are quite friendly, and do go out of their way to assist you. The Bad:That said, our experience at the Bale fell short of what one would expect of a property with a high-price tag. Although service was generally excellent, there were some shortcomings in this area. Check-in was adequate, but ithe hotel failed to adequately explain the complex controls in the room to us. Check-out was especially challenging and unpleasant. Although a car was waiting to transport us, our luggage was in fact held hostage in the room until the hotel was certain that our bill had been paid. This simply delayed our preparartions for departing. Breakfast was excellent; dinner above-average, but lunch merely marginal at best.One would expect that the hotel would (as other hotels of this caliber in Bali do so)provide bottled water for free whether in the room or dining with the hotel, as most hotels do not have potable water. Being charged $5.00 US for a bottle of Aqua simply becuase you request it with lunch is ridiculous. That's gouging the guest for a little extra money.The Ugly:There were problems with the airconditioning and ceiling fan. When we moved into a new room our second night, which had already been reserved in a different, lower price category, the new room had multiple problems, from a sink that obviously leaked (with a towel placed under the sink to catch the dripping water!!), a toilet that ran all night, and a resident frog in our room, which defied our attempts to move it outside our quarters while we tried to sleep.)Although the hotel clearly knew about some of the problems with the new room before it moved us into it, instead of informing us of them, it tried to upsell us into another room at a higher price!! Indeed, when brought these problems o the attention of the rooms manager at the time of check-out, we were informed that the hotel had planned to take this room out of service because of the problems with it. This did not sit with us well. The hotel did not offer anything to address these issues other than a smile. We were not smiling when we left..

<Content>Tranquil  We stayed in the Bale for the second leg of our 2 week stay in Bali. I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. We were shown around our amazing pavillion (single deluxe) but decided the sun wasn't on garden for long enough so we were moved to a pavillion where the sun was shining on the pool etc until about 4pm (no .36). It is so private, you feel as though it's just you and your partner there! The novelty of stepping into your own pool from the bathroom did not wear off! We were chaffur driven to the beach every morning - when you arrive you receive towels, sun cream, aftersun, body mist and as much water as you wanted. The beach is lovely, alhough the sand is very soft so you tend to sink in it! Cannot complain really but I did prefer the beach in Seminyak. They chaffur you back to your villa when you are ready and we enjoyed the rest of our afternoons in our pool and snoozing on the day bed! Nusa Dua is a lot quiter than Seminyak but we discovered the Bali Collection which has loads of restaurants and shops to keep you amused. Another restaurant you must visit is the Bumbu Bali-authentic Balinesse cuisine. We had breakfast most days served to us in our own garden (fab) at no extra charge. You are allocated a private butler for the duration of our stay but we didn't see him once, we dealt with several members of staff, all of which were lovely and friendly. Their English isn't great but not too much of an issue (only when ordering breakfast over the phone!) All in all a fab time and we were gutted to leave. - miss the complimentary fresh cookies everyday

<Content>Designer chic with a heart The Bale; what can you write about a hotel that goes out of their way to give you the most personalized holiday you could dream of. Nothing was too much trouble. We arrived with high expectations and were not disappointed. The minimalist architecture felt a little to minimalist but the staff really seamed happy to be working there and this provided the warmth that the buildings lacked. The professionalism was first class and the Villas are designed to provide a small private piece of paradise. The food really is as good as all the guide books say but without all the pretension of a 5 star restaurant. The Bale also has a beach area. There is a courtesy car that will take you whenever you want, walk (15 mins) or just borrow a mountain bike. The team at the Bale arranged a mountain bike trip for us that was exactly to our requests and also provided information about their favorites beaches that were on the route. Many of these were not on the tourist maps.This is a place of relaxation and peace, if you want a night life then make use of the car service and take a trip to Kuta. The major hotels are all located down the road and have a restaurant area. This is not 5 star eating but mass production restaurants that serve nice food at expensive prices. It is however packed with all the shops you could want so is an alternative way to spend an evening there.Having been to both Nusa Dua and the Kuta area I would return to the Bale without hesitation and travel to Kuta in the evenings. The service of the hotel truly deserves it's reputation as one of the small leading hotels in the world!

<Content>Peace and Serenity Itself! We recently stayed at The Bale during the second half of our Bali trip. The first half was spent at a private villa in Seminyak. We were on a mission this trip scouting for venues for a private event and therefore spent most of the first few days of our trip zooming around Bali. By the time we arrived at The Bale, we were totally exhausted and what a haven it was for the weary traveller! The Bale is nothing short of beautiful with minimalistic, elegant modern architecture and interior design. The staff were very polite and did everything they could to make our stay a very comfortable one. The actual check in was done in our pavilion by the butler and over in 5 minutes. We were then left alone to enjoy the place. The villa itself is big and spacious and the architects had thoughtfully designed it such that the bathroom opens out into the pool. We had previously stayed at other pool villas and it was always a bit untidy having to trudge through the bedroom after getting out from the pool in order to get to the bathroom. Our package came with daily breakfast which we could choose to either enjoy in our villa or the restaurant. It was ala carte, which meant you could order anything and everything from the menu. I thoroughly enjoyed the local cuisine and had that every day for breakfast.We also had dinner once at the restaurant. For the service and the quality, I do not think it is too expensive. Naturally, a much cheaper meal can be had at nearby Nusa Dua but the experience was worth it. Staff addressed us by name and their service was discreet and polite and the presentation of the food was excellent. The food itself was very good.On another day, we arranged for a candlelight dinner in our pavilion. We had tea at the restaurant and in the thirty minutes we were away, the staff had laid out all the candle lights and flowers for our dinner! Dinner itself was a delightful experience.We also had massages every single day of our stay there as it came with the package. The spa is, like the rest of the hotel, beautiful. The rooms were big, some with bathtubs which can fit 3 people, and others with jacuzzis and steam rooms. The massages were also excellent, with the exception of the hot crystal therapy which we felt did not do much for our aching backs. The spa menu was very comprehensive, and even had options like hypnotherapy. The Bale is rather conveniently located, about a few minutes' drive from the Nusa Dua shopping areas. They also provide free transfers to and from Nusa Dua.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in The Bale and would highly recommend it as a honeymoon destination or just a place to relax and unwind.

<Content>Designer living in Nusa Dua Highly recommend the Bale. It is right next door to the Aman Nusa, but having visited both we were glad with havnig chosen the smaller property which felt so much more personal and welcoming. There were only about 20 rooms when we were there, but we saw that another 10 or so were in the pipeline - which were going to be even better than the rooms which we stayed in. The facilities are not vast, gym is basic and there is only one restaurant - but bear in mind that there are only 20 rooms and that you have huge private villas with your own pool, garden, outdoor day bed and so on that it is the kind of place you go for seclusion and privacy - it was the first week of our honeymoon so just perfect! An especially nice touch was that you can breakfast in your villa at no extra charge - I guess it makes sense because the place doesn't have the numbers for a buffet. The only down-side was the beach, a 3 min drive away and a little bit cramped. The staff couldn't do enough for you - thoroughly helpful. Do think though if Nusa Dua is where you would like to go - there was much life in places like Jimbaran and Seminyak.

<Content>Place to remember for We stayed at The Bale last June as a romantic getaway to start off our summer vacation. We booked through our travel agent and were shown a couple of small pictures of the hotel beforehand. From the pictures we thought the style of the hotel would be too urban for our liking, but soon as we arrived we found the hotel's design to be minimalistic/contemporary in design yet with great attention to detail. We liked the suite's layout and atmosphere, very bright outside but calm inside. I think every suite at the hotel has a small pool (not a just plunge pool) and an awesome, transparent-roofed day bed. I believe we spent most of the time outside of our room just lying on the day bed enjoying the cool ocean breeze. Being a hotel junkie myself I like to try different hotels when traveling, even on the same trip, so I rarely stay at the same hotel repeatedly unless it's for business purpose. I am currently planning another trip to Bali for this year, and I was very tempted to call up The Bale again to see if they have vacancy. The overall experience made me wants to stay there again.The Bale is definitely a place to remember. Even after one year, the wow factor is still there every time we look at the pictures we took.. Anyone planning a trip to Bali or particularly looking to stay in the Nusa Dua area should definitely give it a try (for at least two nights, so you can have one full 24-hour day to enjoy the wonderful premise and the great service). Highly recommended

<Content>Seclusion + Simplicity = Soothing We spent our honeymoon at this small yet refined hotel, because it had to be Bali, and the Bale is as good as it gets. What we liked:- Secluded villas provide pure privacy. Very relaxing.- Great daybed and small private pool- Friendly Service- No kids, no crowds = no noise. Very quiet indeed.- Very delicious breakfast, available in-room- Simple yet classy architecture. No pseudo-luxurious tacky stuff.- Free car transport within Nusa Dua (to restaurants, etc.)- Stereo with nice music is provided- Library with internet access available- Check-in/out in the room- Lovely barbecue in your own garden availableWhat's not so nice:- The beach is far away, and not so nice. Not worthwhile going.- The location is a bit far away from the center of nusa dua- The restaurant is nice, but somewhat too empty to enjoy.- Fairly high price for Balinese standards, but worth it.- No kids under 16 allowed (now that we have a daughter)Conclusion:A classy and refined, clean and well maintained, friendly and understated resort we wouldn't mind being trapped in for another while. Not recommended for the overly active crowd or those that like hanging out at the hotel bar.

<Content>Fantastic, amazing staff Could not disagree more with one of the other reviewers. The staff were FANTASTIC - nothing was too much trouble, everyone knew our names and used them, and learnt what we liked and how we liked it. It was the least stressful holiday experience, solely due to the staff. The restaurant menu was quite limited while we were there, but it wasn't a problem, we told the chef what sort of food we liked and he cooked something different for us. Jose, the manager was great, did an itinerary for us for a one day island tour, and arranged for us to visit the Four Seasons at Sayan and Uma at Ubud, just so we could see some other hotels if we wanted to return to Bali another year. Also gave us a lot of suggestions for eating outside the hotel. The only criticism I had, and it was minor, was that some of the furnishings were a bit tired (the roman blinds were wonky!) and there was no mosquito net. We like minimalist, so were happy with the design, if your tastes are for the more opulent surroundings, you will be disappointed. Would go back - and we rarely say that.

<Content>The Bale I have to disagree with the last review, we found the staff to be more than helpful. We must have changed our minds about when we wanted lunch/ dinner, where we wanted so many times, and nothing was to much trouble. Well done to Lisa and her staff for making our stay very special. I would also like to mention the food, it was excellent! Benny their executive chef was top class, and every dish was a triumph. I must admit we did not like the beach, but I had known it was not up to much from other reviews. Its not really a beach resort.We loved the pavilions, and enjoyed the private pool so no real need to venture out, but that was what we had planned. I know these things can depend on when you stay and who's there, but we had a wonderful time and I would recommend the Bale.Gordon and Miriam

<Content>Desing over substance If you like modern design over substance this may be a place for you. Whilst you cannot deny the privacy of some of the villas and their decor (but hardly comparable with some resorts in Ubud), the service and personal touches are where this resort fails by a long mark - from several calls to let us know that breakfast would stop being served in a few minutes (even though there is 24h room service) to staff not being able to recommed a restaurant (or understand you at all) to the manager who seemed more interested in the nightlife of Kuta than his guests concerns. In addition, being so modern, the resort lacks any central point and the restaurant was virtually empty on all nights of our stay.Having said all that, the staff were very charming and trying hard, the small beach club (few minutes drive away!) makes things a bit more pleasurable on the public and often busy stretch of beach. There must be a more personable place to stay in Nusa Dua?

<Content>Touch of class I have just stayed 3 nights at the Bale during a 2 week stay in bali during which I also stayed at another two 5 star hotels so i am fortunate to be able to do some comparisons.The Bale is a wonderful hotel. Its best quality is something very hard to define-as soon as you enter its walled compound you are overcome with a feeling of serenity. The staff are completely professional and the restaurant is top class.The best bits:- The staff are very professional, extremely obliging and friendly and very good at their jobs- The Bale comes to life at night-it is set aglow by hundreds of candles and has a wonderful ambience- The staff are treated well and seem to love their jobs- I think there is some sort of system whereby when you leave your room for breakfast or dinner the housekeeping staff are somehow alerted to this. Our room was turned over twice a day but never when we were about. We would come back from dinner and all the blinds would be down, candles lit, music playing air con turned up, fresh towels, fresh cookies, fresh water-very good service-the room was beautfiul with everything you could want-you get to choose a range of toiletries on arrival, there are cute dressing gowns and slippers, toblerone in the fridge and fresh cookies (you can tell what my priorities are), stereo, tv dvd players (with great choice of dvds)-the outdoor pool is a great size and the bale day bed very luxurious-the restaurant ambience and music is spot on, the food is great and not too pricey. The Swiss chef speaks to each dining guest indivudally each night. He will make whatever your want-the staff really look after you-i got bitten by something before i arrived and every single member of staff was falling over themselves to get to the bottom of it and make me more comofrtable-the library and spa are top classdown sides--check out the pictures of this place to make sure its your taste beforehand. it is ultra uber minimalistic and modern. if this is your taste then you may not find a better example of this sort of design. if its not your taste you may find it a little cold and foreboding. it is not a design which was meant to blend with nature-dont come here if you want a beach. the beach club is not how it appears on the website photos. you wouldnt want to spend time at the beach but with the hotel amenities that is not a problem as long as you didnt have your heart set on a beach holiday- this is not a place for viewsall in all a fantastic hotel which in temrs of class and professionalism and slickness stands above the restps i stayed at the bale with a female friend not a partner and it was a great place for that-if you are travelling with a friend you will feel athome here whilst everyone else was in couples it didnt feel like a honeymoon resort for those that are not

<Content>Truly Luxurious Having just returned from 6 nights at The Bale I felt I must write and compliment the quality of the hotel.The Pavilions are fantastic and make you not want to leave their surroundings. The staff are very professional and very friendly and helpful.The drivers recommended local restaurants in the evening and these were excellent value and good quality.We also had a couple's spa treatment and again this was very good. There is also a reasonable gym if you want to burn some calories.Overall I would recommend the Bale if you are looking for a chilled holiday with plenty of privacy. If you want a beach holiday go elsewhere.

What can you ask for more? Maybe they might improve their Beach Club, with new bal茅s and more services. But with a pool in your pavillon you do not really feel like going out!!!

<Content>Love the architecture and the intimacy! The Bale is a beautiful piece of resort hotel architecture - the lovely things you see in the pictures on its website are indeed what you're going to get. Food is good, the spa is also lovely, but the high point would be the private pool and the outdoor lounge area. Great place to unwind! That you can wake up and step right from the bathroom straight into your private pool (which leads straight off the bathroom) is pure bliss! Because of its small number of villas, the Bale is also very intimate (try to get the highest villa for best privacy), and do consider booking the whole place for a party with your best friends - I was seriously considering having my wedding there and it would have been very chic indeed!

<Content>The ultimate in style, comfort and privacy Simply the best. The website pictures were nice but it's nothing compared to the real thing...loved the minimalist design and the friendly service. It's right next to the golf course, the Amanusa and the private beach, but it doesnt really matter as the best part is your own private villa. It's so chic, luxurious, complete with a huge private pool that you never want to leave. We had our lunch delivered to our villa while we swam in the pool, followed by a perfect massage at the spa. Breakfast is included in the rate and it's soo yummy. Transport in the area and internet usage is totally free. I would choose The Bale over Amanusa anyday. It's created for couples and adults though, head for the big chains or the private villas if you have a family. The rate is apparently going up quite steeply, it's definitely getting more and more popular!

<Content>Not to be missed !!! On arrival into Denpasar, we were greeted by our driver holding a board with our names written on it. On meeting us, we were walked to a van nearby and given cold towels which were very much appreciated in the Balinese heat. The driver was friendly and gave us a good review of the area. Approximately 20 minutes after leaving the airport, we arrived at The Bale where we were greeted by our butler and a whole bunch of other staff. The butler walked us straight to the room; giving us information on the hotel spontaneously. Our pavillion was huge and equipped with a pool - not a plunge pool but a proper private infinity edge lap pool with 2 frangipani trees beside it. The butler welcomed us into the room where a fresh welcome drink was prepared and waiting in the fridge. Balinese music was also lightly playing in the background. We were registered while drinking our welcome drink in the pavillion. Equipped with our own garden, pool deck, outdoor shower, outdoor day bed, 2 vanity, double bath, separate shower and toilet, oversized king bed and tv/radio/minibar/homade cookies etc, the pavillion was nothing ever than immaculate. We were never EVER disturbed by the staff, but whenever something was needed, it mysteriously appeared - I am serious! We would wake up and go to breakfast and upon return 40 minutes later, the room was tidied up. In the afternoon when we went for a massage and back, the room was once again cleaned. In the evening upon returning from dinner, the room was cleaned! I seriously wondered how many times a day the room was serviced. Wherever we wanted to go during our stay, our butler would organise transport and bookings for us. We went to a local restaurant on the first night and was driver there and back (complimentary of the hote) at our conveneince. On the second night, we went a bit further, so we took a taxi. If you have a chance, try the massage facilities. It is not overpriced at all. We tried a traditional balinese massage, which costed us US$50 per person. That is what we would have paid in a standard massage place in Sydney anyway, let alone a 5 star Small Luxury Hotel. The massage spa area is equipped with a bath (have to pay extra to use), sauna, steam bath etc. The bath has a small water fall to it so you can hear the sound was water during your massage - simply heavenly. For a moment during the massage, I actually had to think where I was!The food was fantastic - the room service menu was exactly the same as the restaurant menu. If you ever have a chance to go to Bali, this hotel is a must. However, please bear in mind that Nusa Dua is an exclusive area with nothing much to do (no shopping, no bars/clubs etc). It will be perfect for people who expect the highest levels of service, cleanliness, comfort and do not really want to venture far from the hotel.I highly recommend at least 2 nights at The Bale if you are heading that way
