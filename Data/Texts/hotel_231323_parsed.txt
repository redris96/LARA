<Content>No frills; Great location Typical Ibis hotel - safe standard hotel. No frills but great location being a 30 second walk from Grand Central Station.Room was small but not a real issue for us only staying 2 nights. Room had great view into Amsterdam town though.Hot breakfast didnt have has browns or bacon so a bit disappointing for full english breakfast lovers!Canal Bus hop on hop off tour stop right in front of central station.

<Content>An Old Favourite I booked into the Ibis beside the Centraal Station in Amsterdam from 20/27 December 2008. I have stayed there many times (about 20!) and usually go back mainly because of its location: it's beside the terminuses for the tramcars, buses and boats and a very short walk across a bridge to a great shopping street that leads down to the palace.First, the gripes: As a journalist I use my laptop a great deal and they charge 鈧?5 a day which is a ridiculous price and would have come to 鈧?75 for the week. Fortunately, my regular coffee shop has a number of computers with Internet connection and I worked from there every day for about one or two euro per hour. Also, the service in the restaurant at the Ibis is very, very slow, although the food was excellent when it eventually came.Talking about restaurants, I can highly recommend the Silveren Spiegel - a few minutes walk from the hotel - and also The Five Flies (that's the name!) further down the Spuistraat. Both are expensive. The best kept secret in Amsterdam is a restaurant IN the railway station (on platform 2b) and about 2 minutes walk from the Ibis. It's like something out of an Agatha Christie novel, with the waiters dressed in black with white aprons, fine decor in an eastern style (the oak double linenfold panelling around the restaurant is of superb quality), and a large white parrot or cockatoo - sometimes noisy - called Elvis, on the service counter. Don't get too near him as he might be in one of his moods! The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. I can especially recommend the steaks and wiener schnitzels for dinner, while the Dutch stews are the best value for lunch anywhere. I go there every day (it took me about 3 years staying at the Ibis before I found the place in its most unlikely situation) and is another good reason for staying at the hotel. Say hello to Dino the Libyan waiter from me if you go there.The Ibis Hotel is also handy for the shops in the station, especially the small supermarket, the chemist's, and the stationery shop. There is also a good Information Centre on platform 2 where you can buy various travel tickets for a week or so and get pamphlets on what's going on in the city.

<Content>Spot on stayed there for three nights and it was perfect, room was clean and tidy and any problems were resolved within 15minutes as per the hotel policy. Within walking distance of all major attractions, would recommend to a friend. You pay a bit more than average but it's a lot better than staying in a 12bed dorm

<Content>cenral location A good location easy to walk to the cities attractions, very recently had a new reception and bar and work was still ongoing. Bedrooms very modern with a lovely shower. Breakfast was buffet style and adequate. Walk up prices were expensive and I witnessed people being told the price and walking away so best to book via the ferries etc.

Also the restaurant and the bar looks great, before we went to town we had a drink in the bar. Breakfast is served until 12.00 o'clock ! The staff of this hotel is very friendly and helpfull.

<Content>Loved the Hotel My husband and I just got back from our two week honeymoon where we stayed at the Hotel Ibis Centre for one week. We both loved this hotel. The customer service was excellent. Everyone we encountered at the front desk were very helpful and welcoming. One gentleman, not sure of his name, helped my husband find where we could rent a scouter and where we may park it over night. The room was larger than I expected which was nice. The bed was a bit to firm for our liking but still comfortable. The bathroom was clean and very nice. A little cramped when you get two people in it getting ready in the morning but still nice. The one thing both my husband and I loved about the hotel was that it is right beside the train station. Okay really on top of it. But you do not hear the trains that much. Ask for a room above floor 5 and your will be fine. I would absolutely rebook this hotel on future trips and will recommend it to others too. One suggestion though... There is a lot of bikes outside of the hotel, because of a bike parking lot, so be careful when walking to the sidewalk.

<Content>Consider other hotels in the area first This hotel was tolerable for an overnight stay. I knew they were going through some renovations which I thought would have been finished by the time we arrived. But the renovations were still going. This was not a problem. However, I think they need to revamp their front desk. The front desk service was the WORST service we've ever had. Only 1 person was able to do check in or even help guests queries at the one time. We had to wait 10minutes while the 1 front desk guy tried to arrange a change of room for an existing guest due to noise. Despite stating we will need an early check in, we were informed we didn't have a room until 2pm. We were able to leave our luggage in their lock up room until then. So we went off to get some breakfast before heading off to our conference. When we finally got our tiny room, we discovered it was really old and definitely needed a revamp. Our room overlooked the bike park. The double room barely had enough room for our 2 luggage - they were not big bags! The bathroom was even tinier. If you're a big tall person, you won't be able to sit on the toilet! The shower was in a derilic condition, the aircon just blew dust and didn't work. Initially both the cold and hot water just had boiling hot water, which I scolded myself when attempted to wash my hand. When I tried to call the front desk about this, despite being on the phone for 2 minutes ringing, no one picked up the phone at all.We had minimal of the included breakfast the next morning. We didn't feel safe to eat any of the cooked food. Check out was a pain. We had to again wait as only 1 person can handle check in and check out at the one time. We chose this hotel due to the close proximity to where our cruise ship docked and also being booked through the RAI website for our conference. There are other hotels close by, consider others and make this hotel your absolute LAST choice.

<Content>Errr... it was OK! Well, it's great if you want a place to sleep and thats about it as it's right next to the train station, which was great for us as we had to get the train from the airport.It was being renovated which we already knew about and boy does it need a make over. Not a brilliant place to stay. It has the essencials but thats about it. A bed, toilet, shower was ok.The breakfast they offered as the restaurant was out of bounds was totally weird and horrible. Some ham, cheese, bread, coffee and orange juice. No facility to toast your bread. Weird!!Don't stay there if you want a decent place to stay. Good for a weekend with a big group where all you need to do is sleep there.I'd say it definatly wasn't worth 拢100 a night!!!

<Content>Stayed here 7 times in a row Ideal for short stays in the area. Very close to Cental Station therefore always easy to find with no need to use taxis. Have used plenty of other hotels locally, but always seem to end up going back to the Ibis. Down side is that the restaurant and bar are under refurbishment at the moment but should be ready when we return in November. Also can be noisy - trains, cars, construction work, etc. Staff are friendly and helpful, although check-in/out can be slow at peak times.

<Content>We loved the Ibis! We arrived at the hotel about 4 hours before check in and as we were going to a festival all day the staff allowed us to leave our luggage in a locked room which only they have a key for. We eventually checked in around 11.30pm and were seen to immediately with a very efficient service.The room was immaculate and lovely and cool, the bed was enormous. The water pressure in the shower was excellent, which was especially impressive as we were on the top floor!The hotel was very close to the centre of Amsterdam and the train station and therefore very convenient.Slight downside was the lack of restaurant/bar but we were informed of this by our travel agent when booking and we were perfectly happy about this. Breakfast was the only meal included and the hotel provided a continental style breakfast on each floor each morning, whilst this wasn't anything special it was nice of them to offer this facility.Overall I think that the Ibis is a wonderful little city centre hotel, perfect for a short trip to Amsterdam and whilst the hotel is undergoing renovation, they are doing this to improve the hotel for the guests and are trying to make the in between time as easy as possilbe.

<Content>BEWAREOF THIS HOTEL TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE..I stayed at this hotel several times in recent years because of its proximity to the train station; however, this time it was intolerable. I booked a three night stay, arriving on a Saturday afternoon. First clue there was no sidewalk to hotel. I had to walk down street and through bicycle racks to enter hotel through narrow opening in construction area.Secondlty there was no lobby, just a check in desk, Third, there was no restaurant or bar, Next I discovered the air conditioning was off,,and windows do not open more than a crack. I asked to cancel my reservation but was told because I had guaranteed it, my credit card would be held for 1 night at least if I didn't stay.I suffered one night.. cost was over $200 U.S. for 1 night and I'minsensed over this. There was nothing on their web site informing potential guests about the existing situation and to me this is unacceptable. I am writing to hotel headquarters about this, Please be aware of this situation before you book.

<Content>Best for Tourists Location, location, location. This property is within walking distance to most sights. It's right next to the Amsterdam Central station, which takes you just about anywhere in the Netherlands, including to/from the airport.The rooms are very small and limited, but clean and decent for short stays. The bathroom is even smaller, so don't expect anything nice. The staff is friendly and helpful and can speak many languages. They have a special luggage room where you can keep your bags there after you check-out if you want to do some afternoon sightseeing.Great hotel for tourists. Otherwise there are nicer hotels in the area if you have the money to spend.

<Content>Average Basic Accommodation but central Booked through DFDS, hotel is very central and is clean and comfortable, the rooms are small and basic but for its price range its good. Downside is very long check in queues but staff speak english and you can check in early and leave luggage for pick up later. Would stay here again as when visiting a city , you are their to see city not spend all day in a hotel room. For a bughet hotel it is well worth the money.

<Content>OK but with some problems When I visited it was under renovation and expansion so there where some problems related to that. This renovation is going to carry on all the way through May 2008 as the front desk informed.The problems related to that were:1. Breakfast was served on each floor in the elevator waiting area, which meant that there were only beverages, bread butter and marmalade.2. Construction work started at 07:00 so if your not an early bird you will be disturbed.Other then that, the location is great as far as connectivity is concerned and it is in the center. It is quite noisy so the window should remain closed. All staff were polite and helpful. The rooms were not that clean as I found used soap in the shower from a previous customer so I was concerned about bathroom cleanliness.The furniture was newly renovated, but the pillows were so big and bouncy it was annoying. The TV had terrible reception so you couldn't really enjoy anything.The rest of the hotel area was not renovated (old carpet and lighting fixtures) so I am not sure if it was in the schedule to be done or not.

<Content>Good value for money. Second time I chose Ibis mainly because of its location and price. Amsterdam is a very expensive city when it comes to accomodation. Ibis can be found for 鈧?100 breakfast included and that is a good deal for Amsterdam. Yes, the bathrooms are small, yes it may e a bit on the noisy side but I can tell you two things...if you are in Amsterdam you don't want to spend your time in the bathroom except when nature calls, and the second thing is if you want peace and quiet go to Santorini in November and not Amsterdam! Enjoy it!

<Content>Central but somehow noisy hotel Stayed one night in this hotel. It is located in the center of Amsterdam : the good thing is that you are in the middle of everything with train and bus very close to the hotel, the bad thing is this is quite noisy ...The rooms on the back of the hotel are only a few meters from the railway station, and there are trains passing almost all along the night. If possible ask for a room on the front, they should be less noisy.Rooms are just ok, I would say in the low/middle range of a typical Ibis hotel. Bathromm was with an italian shower (no basin).One good point is the lobby, which is quite nice. Breakfast is good and well served.Finally, at 120鈧?a night, it is one of the most expensive ibis I have ever tested !

<Content>Great location but small rooms My friend and I booked this hotel for our weekend getaway in Amsterdam. The reception staff was quite helpful. When we asked them whether the Heineken experience was opened, they went online and checked for us right away.The room is a bit too small and the bathroom is small as well. My friend and I are girls but we still find the bathroom to be quite small. Breakfast was ok. The hotel is under renovation so the breakfast room was closed. They served their buffet right by the lifts instead (on every floor). The temperature in the room was a bit too warm. We tried to leave our window opened but we would hear this eerie wind-blowing noise seeping through if we left our windows opened. Also since the back of the hotel faces the train station, we could hear the train entering the platform when we left our windows opened. It could be very noisy. This hotel is great for its location (about 3 min walk from the train station - you will see it on your right once you leave the station) and it is quite clean! That's about it. I find it to be quite pricey.

<Content>Very small room Our reservation some how got screwed up and it was not in the system at all. But luckily we got a room when they had just told an Asian couple that they didn鈥檛 have any rooms available. Our room had two twin beds in a very very small room. I had to turn sideways on the toilet to fit. Bring your own hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc because the first day we only got two small bars of soap and the second day we got a bottle of shampoo. You can buy all the toiletries you need in the lobby, but they are pretty costly. I think you can also borrow their hair dryer for a 20 euro deposit.There was no A/C, but we just opened the window since it was cool outside. It was a little loud though since the big bicycle parking garage is right across the street and the train station is right behind you. Anyway, good hotel and nice staff for being right next to the train station.

<Content>Needs refurbishment Tired, dated, cramped  noisy: more like a student hall of residence than a 3* hotel. Location is great though - close to the station  city centre. The staff are excellent  were very apologetic when I requested a room change due to a strong smell of cigarette smoke (this is a non-smoking hotel, with signs everywhere reminding you of this: I hope the person staying in the room before me got the E50 surcharge). Breakfast is OK. The hotel will be closed from next week (I think) for a long overdue refurbishment - it may well be worth staying here when they reopen.

<Content>Noisy and unpleasant The rooms are noisy as they face either the central trains station or a main road. The rooms are small and charmless and the bathroom is really small- you have to be quite agile in order to manouvre between a wall and the sink so as to reach the toilet.Breakfast is served at a street level room with glass wall facing a bicycle rack (same view applies also to the first floor). it is dark and unpleasant. The hotel has no proper restaurant, it is only possible to order a take away pizza which you have to go and collect from the bar.

<Content>Has seen better times When going to Amsterdam, it was clear for me in the past, to choose this place for its location, i.e. connectivity and affinty to downtown.But physically speaking, the location is deteriorating. The building is getting old, the railway atmoshere depressing, the refurbising activitiies around Amsterdam Centraal annoying. Breakfast was ok but better at other ibis places. Service is on the downside, while rates are on the upside. With 鈧?165 for a double, there are better solutions around, closer to downtown, larger rooms, more attractive architecture, less bicycles stored. Note: you might be able to get better rates from 3rd party websites than from their own, though the defend their case heavily when you try to talk with them about this.Even the fact that Ibis declared itself as a non smoker hotel does not support this rate for a **-hotel .... Sorry.

<Content>Basic but handy Stayed in this hotel for one night purely because we arrived by train from the airport and didn't have much time to change and attend a meeting. The hotel itself is almost part of the station. Just exit the main entrance and walk right for a few minutes past the taxi rank. This obviously means train noises can be quite loud inside of the rooms. The rooms are typical Ibis, small / basic but clean. I would not stay here longer than one night though. There is another Ibis hotel in Amsterdam within a 15 minute taxi ride from the station, apparently this hotel is more modern and rooms are slightly bigger.

<Content>Clean and Quiet After spending two terrible nights at the Amstel Botel, I checked myself into the Ibis for my last night in Amsterdam. I didn't want to stay too far from the train station, as I had an early flight in the morning.The Ibis is 100% non-smoking. The room was very clean and the bathroom was fairly spacious. Even though my room faced the street, it was very quiet.I paid 100 euros ,including tax. Breakfast was not included and there were no coffee or tea making services in the room. This was not too much of an issue for me, but would have been a nice extra.

<Content>Ideal for a short stay Like other reviewers I'd confirm that this is not the hotel to choose for a long stay. A couple of nights was long enough in our small room overlooking the station platform and men at work! Everything was spotlessly clean in our room, and the bed was comfy. The hotel's ideal location means that you can walk everywhere worth seeing within 10-15 minutes, and only a couple of minutes to the water taxis and sightseeing boats if you want to go further afield. However, when going to and from the hotel, no matter how hard you try, you cannot avoid having to pass by the public urinal on the bridge corner which absolutely hummed! Staff at the hotel were friendly enough, and if like us, you get the late night or early hours munchies and dont want to leave the hotel, we recommend the hotel's 24 hour pizza service, as the four cheese pizza was delicious! The bathroom was just too small to be functional, and I defy anyone of standard height to be able to sit on the loo without their knees crammed up against the wall! We did not find the station too noisy at night, but there was a very distracting knocking/scratching noise which seemed to come from the air conditioning system all night, and despite our best efforts we could not eliminate it. All in all, this is a good hotel for a short break or overnighter.

<Content>Short Stay Only I stayed at The Ibis for 1 night with my husband and my parents. It's clean but very basic. Definately not the place to stay if you want luxury. Ideal for a cheap overnight stay and the location is great. Don't bother with the breakfast there, hard scrambled eggs and chewy sausages that taste of nothing. Reasonably priced bar and very friendly staff.

<Content>Good location Went to Amsterdam with DFDS and stayed at this hotel for night, it has a great location - next to central railway station and about 10 minute walk to dam square. The Canal cruises starts just opposite thehotel also. The rooms are average size and are good value for money, DFDS charged us 拢60 for the room for the night. There can be long queues trying to check in and out and reception staff will stop to answer the phone in betwen checking people in and out which adds to the wait as the phone seemed to ring none stop.Hotel is very accomodating at allowing you to check in early (10am) as the boat arrives early in the morning and they will store your luggage as well on checking out or you can keep your room for 10 euros an hour.Would recommend this hotel if you stay in amsterdam for the location and value for money.

<Content>not great I'd stay away from this one. First of all, it lacks charm. Secondly, right now as I'm writing this, there's a horrible creaking noise that I know will keep me up half the night. Then all day long, it's the taxis queueing outside for the train station. If you're coming in by train and you don't want to drag your bags around upon arrival to Amsterdam, this is the closest hotel possible, so you may like the location, but I don't. I'd say the nicest area to stay in Amsterdam is around Vondelpark, just a little further out from Leidseplein, and for this kind of money, you can find all sorts of smaller hotels around there that will be nicer and have more charm. It's far away from the station, but if you're staying more than a few days that shouldn't be an issue.

<Content>Weekend break Myself and my partner has just returned from a weekend cruise break to see MADONNA at the Amsterdam Arena we booked the ferry crossing and a one night stay in the Ibis Centre hotel. On arriving in the centre of Amsterdam we had a short walk over to the hotel. We checked in around 11am and were told our room would be ready by 2pm. Our luggage was kept in a secure room and we went out to explore. This is our fourth visit to Amsterdam and once again it did not dissapoint. I recommend a visit to Rembrantplein, this is a tram ride away but very nice. Full of bars, resturants and shops and also not far from the Flower Market. When returning to the Ibis our room was ready. The hotel and room was very clean and welcoming. The only disadvantage is the hotel is now 100% non-smoking you have to stand outside. Our room was a twin room facing the railway station. There was a bit of noise but not disturbing at bed time. There is also some construction going on as the hotel is being extended but that also did not cause a problem. The staff I found were excellent and very helpful. We did not return from the concert until very late (2am) so we were hungry. The staff told us we could have a pizza from the take-away they provide even though was only available till 1am. This was a godsend. They telephoned our room when it was ready. The breakfast was included in the price and we found it very good. Buffet style containing eggs, sausage, beans, fresh toast and much more... Overall I rate this hotel very highly and would stay here again (even though I am a smoker)

<Content>typical European chain hotel well, actually, I stayed at this hotel in NOV 2001 not NOV 2002, and it was during a 5 week trip around Europe by train. You need to read my review of Notel Winston in AMS as well to understand this one better. My original plan for hotel stays was to avoid all American and European hotel chains like Hilton, Best Western, or Ibis, especially asit was right after US 9/11 attacks. Plus, I booked only locally owned hotels to help the citizens and economy of each place. Things turned bad in AMS: read the other review. I am making an exception for this city....For a single traveler on a budget who does not plan to spend his/her entire stay in AMS stoned the whole time, I recommend this hotel really above others. At the time I paid 100 euros a night. If you are paying under 100 euro a night in AMS, you will be in a druggie dump in the red light district. I liked everything about Ibis. The location was perfect right by the train station. Yet even though it was in sight of the red light district, it was totally safe and secure. Only a one minute walk away, literally, you are in the center of the action that is AMS.  The room was clean and nicely furnished. As for size, I thought most hotel rooms in Europe are small, and so i dont understand others criticism of the size. i found them adequate. I guess if you are a light sleeper I would request a high floor facing away from the train station, but i had a room overlooking the train tracks ....never had trouble sleeping. marijuana/cannabis IS legal and so even in IBIS the waft of the distictive smoky odor was present here and there .....I went from small hotels with small breakfast service to Ibis and its breakfast buffet in its restaurant. I LOVED it - immensely - as it was the largest breakfast service that i had had. The selection was fine and the staff was great. it was included in the price for me. You gotta verify EVERY detail before you book. I did not eat in the restaurant for dinner as hotel restaurant prices always tend to be more expensive. There are scores of good restaurants just a couple minutes walk, including a pub/restaurant across from the station that serves traditional dutch style crepes and belgian waffles at a good price. Again, i would recommend this hotel to the cheap tourist type like me. The price may not say budget but in the case of AMS, the extra money spent is worth it.

<Content>Very basic We stayed at this hotel Monday 19th - Thursday 22nd. The hotel is pretty basic, and pricey for what you get. The only thing it has going for it is, that it is very central. Lots of traffic right outside and next to the train station. Room was not bad, although pretty small. The showeroom (no bath) was ridiculously small. My husband is 6ft and hated it, ducking about etc. No tea/coffee facilities, no little extras. The wardrobe and shelves were small as well, not full length. If I was going back to Amsterdam I would not stay here again!! We ate at the restaurant the first night as the reception gave us vouchers for a free drink if you took 2 courses, which we did then said they could not take the wine of the bill!!! A ripoff. They took a bottle of water off the bill. Quite pricey food, but there is lots of lovely restaurants around, and reasonable too. We ventured right and over the bridge from the hotel, and found tapes bars, Dutch, Italian, and they were very good. It is quieter up that way too. If you venture to the left out of the hotel it gets quite noisey. A stag party of around 20 arrived as we were leaving, so we were glad about that. Paying a few more euros is definately advisable for a better hotel.

<Content>overpriced hotel we stayed in this hotel,on the 25th/27th of may,we found this hotel very overpriced,for what they have to offer,the rooms are small,the bathroom is a very odd shape,you couldnt sit on the toilet straight,if you try to you will hit your head on some kind of heater ,that didnt even work,the breakfast menu is very limited same thing everyday,and is very overpriced at 13 euros each,we tried to cancel breakfast on the second day but was told that because the second day of our trip was on a weekend the breakfast was included in the price of the room,so we didnt cancel it ,but when it came to checking out they charged us for it saying that it wasnt included in the price of the room,the only good thing about this hotel is the location,the staff are pleasent,

<Content>Pleasant hotel Stayed with a family party of 5 people. Hotel is situated next to the Centraal Stationand is a stone throw from the main Damrak and Canal boat tours. The staff werevery friendly and professional. We only had breakfast and supper which wefound excellent. The rooms were clean and adequate for our purposes. We looked on to the train station which is a hive of activity. Also we could see the river/dam with lotsof ships and barges passing. Apart from the known noise from the train station (which stops later in the evening) there was no trouble from other guests who seem to be professionals or middle aged tourists (no roudy types). A pleasant stay with easy access to the centre despite the Centraal Station being blocked off for major refurbishment. Would go back again.
