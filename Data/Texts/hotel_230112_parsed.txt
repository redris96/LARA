<Content>well managed Dutch hotel next to Dam square I stayed at this hotel for two nights and I liked it.The management really cares for tripadvisor reviews,and they try to give their customers the best possible service.I wish all hotels were like this one.The location is good and rooms offer a good European standard of facilities.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Amsterdam - Fab Accommodation We had originally booked an apartment but were let down and found ourselves in Amsterdam with no accommodation, we walked down the Damrak and saw Hotel Amsterdam. They were brilliant and found us two rooms with no hesitation. The staff, especially ?Jeron (a gentleman on reception) were extremely polite and helpful and the hotel itself had a lovely safe feeling to it. The rooms were perfectly adequate for a traveller, they were very clean, warm and well equipped. The hotel location is brilliant for people to get out and about.The Hotel restaurant offered a fantastic selection for buffet breakfast and also in the evening, again the staff were so friendly and accommodating it was a joy to eat there. I love visiting Amsterdam and will always turn to the Hotel Amsterdam to provide me with accommodation. I found my stay there to be an extremely enjoyable experience.Tracie HatcliffeBirmingham UK.

<Content>Can't be more central than that If you fancy being in the heart of Amsterdam and without breaking the bank, then this is the place for you. If this place were in London, it would be a few metres away from Piccadilly Circus, I mean you just can't be more central. The hotel has a small reception area (virtually no lobby to speak of) and a commercial restaurant which appears to be quite busy, but then it's in the one of the busiest streets in Amsterdam. My experience of the reception staff was very positive, they were friendly and very polite and made you feel immediately welcome. I was only staying one night and I had booked a single room, so I wasn't surprised to be given a room with a single bed. The room was small, but 'perfectly formed', as they say. For such short stay I had no qualms whatsoever, there was everything I wanted, TV, minibar, a well appointed (but very small) bathroom with shower and the single bed was very comfortable. The room and bathroom were clean, though one of the towels had a hole in it and one of the light fittings in the bathrooms was hanging from the wires. Small details which didn't spoil my stay, but perhaps not up to 4* standards. Overall, the room had a cozy feel to it. No views from the window, but I was immensely glad to be given an inside room which was incredibly quiet - a real bonus when you are in a city centre.I had a quick breakfast the following morning and again I found the staff very obliging. The choice of breakfast was OK, I can't really criticise it, all I can say though is that I have been to hotels of similar standards where much more variety was offered and I guess that at 13 Euros extras for breakfast this was probably not as good a value as the room.I would definitely stay here again, friendly staff, comfortable room, perfect location, but if you look for a place with more amenities such large lobby areas, bar(s) etc then you would obviously need to look elsewhere.

<Content>Great location, good hotel I stayed in this hotel for two nights with my sister. The location is divine. It is admittedly a very touristy and noisy area but the hotel is 5-10 minutes walk from everywhere! The central station is a few minutes away and the shopping area, red light district and many other attractions are very close. The hotel is not too new or too luxurious- it is, however, perfectly fine. The rooms are clean and spacious and the staff is really nice and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>fantastic location! I stayed for 4 nights at this hotel, The whole hotel was immaculate and the staff courteous and professional. The room was well equipped (very grateful for the air conditioning) and everything in the room worked.The bathroom was very small (shower only) but was well decorated and everything was in full working order.The location could not have been better, about 3 mins walk from centraal station and practically on the Dam.I did not eat in the restaurant, but please do not take this as a criticism, I just didn't get round to it. Every time I walked past the restaurant, at any time of day, it was either full or very nearly full which as a hotel manager in the UK, I know is the sign of a very, very good restaurant!In summary, a very well run hotel, clean, well presented, with a good restaurant (going on number of diners). My only criticism (and it is very minor indeed) is that the welcome from some of the staff was very polite and courteous but felt a little 'mechanical' and not too genuine. However, do not let this put you off! The Roode Leeuw is very, very good!

<Content>Great Location, but average hotel Booked the hotel and flight through expedia for 2 nights for a great price. The hotel is in a great location! Walking distance from the train station (5 min) and all the main attractions. The staff were very friendly and always chatty and welcoming. The rooms are average really, a little worn down but clean and comfortable. I would recommend the hotel for a short stay as your really only going to be in there for sleep and for that its fine! However, please note that Internet Access is not free and they charge a tourist tax upon checkout as well

<Content>Good clean hotel, great location As usual I spent some time researching good places to stay on Tripadvisor and I was not disappointed with this selection. I have been to Amsterdam once before and stayed in a Hotel quite near to the Anne Frank House but this was a little too far from all the action for my liking, albeit only a short walk.The Hotel de Roode Leeuw (Red Lion) is perfectly situated about 30 metres from Dam Square right in the heart of Amsterdam. It is a short walk from the train station and is on a main street with plenty of amenities close by. There is a popular restaurant downstairs which, although I didn't choose to eat there, seemed to offer a good standard of food as most of the clientele appeared to be smartly dressed locals. The hotel itself was very clean and tidy. Our twin room (I stayed with my brother) was modern, clean and comfortable. There was TV, internet access, safe, mini-bar, coffee making facilities and plenty of wardrobe space in the room. The bathroom was spacious and clean with a good powerful shower unit. Breakfast was not included and when this is the case I prefer to go out and explore the area to find somewhere to have a nice breakfast. In this case I found a nice cafe on a sidestreet and had a croissant with some dutch flatbread and jam.Local tax was added to our hotel bill when we checked out. I think this was 6 euros for our one nights stay so be prepared for this if you are on a tight budget. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and if I return to visit Amsterdam again I would be very happy to stay at The Roode Leeuw.

Good amenities-kettle,safe , well appointed bathroom etc. Breakfast selection rather limited particularly on the hot  fruit fronts.We asked for quiet room as it would be noisy in the front. Home to on of the city's top restaurants serving dutch cuisine. Well worth eating there  as residents we received a discount. Would certainly use this hotel again.

The hotel it self was excellent, very clean and the staff extreamley friendly. The room was very big and the bathroom an excellent size and the mini bar not to over priced. But beware of city tax, upon checkout we had to pay 4 euros per day extra which we where not expecting!

<Content>Great location, friendly staff My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Amsterdam de Roode Leeuw and really enjoyed it. It's location is amazing, central to everything, the Dam Square, Central Station, Red Light District, Chinatown. Almost all of the tram routes pass by either the front of the hotel or behind the hotel, depending on the route. Central Station is walking distance, about 10 minutes (without carrying luggage). I don't really know or care about star ratings, I think that sort of thing is silly. Our room and bed was clean with sound resistant windows. The bathroom was also clean. Our windows looked out onto the roof of the next building and the room was cozy, but I expected that for a hotel centrally located in a compact European city. You can tell that the common areas of the hotel permitted indoor smoking at one time, but the odor was faint and not a problem.I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Staff Absolutely great location on Damrak right at Dam Square and easy walking distance to Central Station. Makes a great 'home base' for discovering the city, and is also convenient for discovering other towns near Amsterdam given its location near the Central Station. We were able to get to nearby Harleem in about 20 minutes. Nothing is too far from this location....either by foot or by Tram.We had a room on the side (south) of the building, on the third floor. With windows closed, it was quiet enough. You do hear some of the partiers outside, but hey it's Amsterdam. The decor was average to good, but clean and more than fine. All staff were extremely helpful and pleasant.I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Never a 4* star hotel!! We stayed at the Hotel De Roode Leeuw from Thu 5th June - Sun 8th June ( got back about 5 hrs ago) First of all it was 575 euros between 2 for a twin comfort room  50 euros deposit for the mini-bar. We checked in  all was pleasant, the girl behind the desk was very polite  friendly. We made are way to the room  straight away i knew it wasn't going to be good value. The carpet was very dated throughout all the hallways and landings, leading this to i slight danky smell. The rooms were not big enought to swing a cat  were very dated and poorly decorated. Now i don't mind if it's small if it's nicely set out but for 575 euros,  it supposedly being a 4 star, i was not impressed. At checkout hey even had the cheek to charge 5% City tax, per day, per person!! God knows what a budget room was like? The staff being polite and good location are the good points but never in a million years is this a 4 star hotel. It has tea/coffee making facilities but al you get is...one tea bag, 1 sugar  1 coffee per day. Terrible. I hate being ripped off so i'll mention the hotels i have stayed in that are ok in Amsterdam. Hotel Rho is a very good 3star  the tulip inn dam square is good also. Hope you make the right choice!!

<Content>Friendly and helpful staff at this hotel I was one of a party of six friends. Some of the rooms were quite small but the staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms on the front of the hotel may be larger but Damrak (street where hotel is situated off Dam Square) is a very busy thoroughfare. The hotel is very central for all attractions and the hotel reception organised an Iamsterdam card which gives you free tram and metro fares and free entry to some attractions, reductions in entry and for some restaurants for 53 euros. Art is good, better than Paris. Didn't eat in the restaurant but it has good reviews for traditional Dutch cuisine. Breakfast was 13 euros but we found local cafes to eat in. But breakfast can mount up if you don't choose carefully. A small french cafe down from hotel gave good value for 5 euros.

<Content>Central with super friendly staff Booked directly with hotel for a business trip. Very centrally located, right off the Dam and a ten min walk to the central rail station. Base rm rate about $200 /nite.Room: small of course, quite typical for EU, but since travelling alone, was fine (suspect was even in a double occupancy room - can't imagine being particularly comfortable if had to share). Clean, but only fair in terms of bed comfort, queen (full?) sized bed.Bathroom: practially performing yoga routine to get into shower: big step up and a big step down, not so easy for those of us not exactly tall. Not recommended for anyone with any minor mobility issues. Very small but adequate. Not much vanity space for toiletries, problematic if travelling with a +1.Dining: ate dinner at hotel restaurant, was decent, homey Dutch-style cuisine, ok since a winter trip. Breakfast buffet was actually nicer than ok: typical selections plus a couple hot options (really nice bacon actually - a splurge for breakfast for me). Staff VERY friendly and helpful!!!

<Content>Great Hotel and Location Never been in Amsterdam before. Picked this hotel because it was near Dam Square (main square) and on the Damrak. It was opposite a lovely stone building which was in fact a department store! Minutes from Dam Square with Madame Toussauds and the red light district was about 5 minutes away through the square - worth a wonder through to see. Hotel room was spotless and the food in the beautifully decorated restaurant was excellent. Hotel was about a 5 minute walk from Amsterdam Central Station where you get the train to and from the Airport. Also where you pict up the canal tour boat - really handy for everything. Lots of restaurants about and the department store is worth a look if you want some retail therapy.Would highly recommend this one.

<Content>Fab hotel in heart of Amsterdam! Just got back from a long weekend at the Roode Leeuw in Amsterdam to celebrate my boyfriend's 40th birthday. Got a really good deal inlcuding breakfast and I sent the hotel an email asking for a nice quiet, non smoking room, preferably with a nice view as it was for my boyfriend's 40th and they went further than that and upgraded us to a junior suite which was fantastic. We had a balcony that overlooked Damrak and we could even see quite a bit of Dam Square as well. Everything looked very festive and the room was huge!This was the start of a fabulous weekend in Amsterdam and we loved every minute of it which was helped by the fact we had such a good base to work from. All the staff were very friendly, the hotel was spotless. Probably the only downside was the breakfast. Luckily it was included in the deal we got otherwise I would not have been happy. It's literally your standard continental breakfast with a couple of hot things, I don't think it is worth the 16 euro they charge for it. On the 2nd day we didn't even bother (even though it was included!) and we ended up going down the road for something decent to eat to set us up for the day!All in all a fab trip to Amsterdam, usual places a must like red light district (not as sleazy as you think, it actually looks quite pretty at night!). Liedesplein very pretty at this time of year and they even have a mini ice skating rink at the moment.If we ever ended up going back to Amsterdam then we would definitely go back to the Roode Leeuw (although I think we may have been spoilt with the upgrade to junior suite!).

<Content>Location doesn't get any better than this! I stayed here for 7 nights on a business trip and I have to say this hotel made an otherwise awful trip a more bearable one! Like some people have said, the rooms are small but ideal for one person. They are very clean and serviced everyday. I made good use of my room whilst staying here, the room enabled me to have some 鈥榤e鈥?time during a very long tradeshow in the city. (the shower was amazing!) The room had a very well stocked mini bar and a room service menu which again I made good use of. The food arrived with 15 minutes and it was lovely! The food in the restaurant of the hotel was again really lovely and quite reasonably priced. I heard a few people in my party complain about the breakfast, powdery scrambled eggs, no fried eggs etc. I however thought the breakfast was great, selection of hot and cold to suit everyone. Lastly I have to say the staff where brilliant, very friendly and willing to do anything. Location wise, it doesn鈥檛 get any better than this, it鈥檚 located right on the edge of Dam Square, there鈥檚 a tram stop literally outside the hotel and all the bars and restaurants you could ever wish for!All in all, I thought the hotel was brilliant and will go back there for a personal trip sometime next year.

<Content>Top floor at the Amsterdam We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights at the end of a barge tour coming from Brugge. We were early and could not get into our room for hours, some members of the group waited till 4 o'clock. Not all rooms are non-smoking which was part of the holdup. We were lucky and got one of the 2 rooftop rooms, view of sky (and air conditioners) though it was up 13 steep steps. It was very roomy and had a very large bathroom, newly redone ....but it did have the odd hair dryer. It was very clean, and very quiet up there. The location was wonderful, breakfast was good, the staff was pleasant and helpful. It was great to be in such a central location.We do not know what we paid as it was included. But the extension to the tour was pricey and we moved to Aaron's BB (see my review) for our last 3 nights.

<Content>In the Heart of the City Spent three days in Amsterdam on a conference. This hotel is virtually on Dam Square and as such could not be more central. Despite the fact that it is on the busy Damrak I experienced 3 very piecefull night's sleep. I suppose the downside was that my room had no view other than an exterior wall. The quality and cleaniliness of the room was very good - it wasn't that big but it was reasonably sized for a single and the bathroom was bigger than average. In the room was a single bed (very comfortable) safe box; tea/coffee facilities, and a well stocked minibar. Staff were generally very polite and helpful. My one word of critisism would be in conection with an electronic lock to my bedroom which became jammed. It was dealt with promptly but still left me inconvenienced for around 30 minutes. It wasn't anyones fault but nevertheless an apology or 'sorry for the inconvenience' would have been nice. Nevertheless I would use this hotel again and recommend it to others. (I've also recently stayed in the Belle Vue in Amsterdam and would also recommend that hotel).

<Content>great food My girlfriend and i booked the hotel on expedia based on the hotels website and other reviews on this site. It was as i was expecting in terms of location and rooms. yes they are small but one look at the outside of the building and you can see why, the old design has left very little room for large rooms without changing the entire lhotel . they were actually fine for what we wanted; clean, comfortable, bright and quiet. despite the fanatstic location on the dam the rooms were silent unless you opened the windows.our room was on the second floor facing the department store on the corner of the dam-tip=a great place for lunch or breakfast is the stores own cafe on the 4th floor which overlooks the hotel-our room had a small balcony with full size patio doors which was great to look out over the crowds and take in the sights and sounds (and smells) of Amsterdam. the airconditioning was a great help too as it was quite humid at night when we were there. the shower room is also small and quite dated in style but there was a notice in the reception saying they were updating these so that is not a long term problem. the restaurant was fantastic-we ate here on the first and last night of our stay. the food was so much better than you could imagine for the cost- a two course with drinks cost us 65 euro total-and believe me for this food and service quality you would be way over 100 GBP for anything close. mixed in with the very welcoming staff who were polite, friendly and helpful at all times,( we arrived at around 9 am and expected to just leave our bags with the hotel till check in, the receptionist first checked to see if we could get a room there and then and as one was ready we were able to check in straight away, by the time we had confirmed our details and reached our room the bags were already in and we could start our holiday by 9.30 am!) -the whole experince was a very good one and would recommend this hotel.A couple tips for Amsterdam-use the train to and from the airport-fast, clean, and cheap-for the Ann Frankhuis go early or late as groups of school kids during the day can make for long queuesFor rainy days-visit the heineken experience-free drink and gift included in the entry fee of just 11 euros-also worth a view is the Amsterdam dungeon and madame tussaud.

<Content>Most helpful staff we've found in large hotel We were here for 4 nights as part of a group tour, but our time here was mainly on our own. Yes, the rooms are small, and the streets outside are uncomfortably crowded.But most rooms in central cities are small and this was esp. well thought-out and clean. The bathroom was full size. The hotel is just steps from the Dam, the center of the city, so a perfect spot for sightseeing. Also, perfect for catching the train for a day of birdwatching in the Oostvaarderplassen with Flevo Birdwatching. The dining room is very nice and the breakfasts were esp. enjoyable.But the best part was the staff, who spoke perfect English and could not have been more helpful.

<Content>couldnt be more central brilliant hotel great location everything within walking distance. rooms a bit on the small side but who stays in the room all day anyway. my husband doesnt like quilts but he was impressed by the ones here. he also said the pillows were the most comfortable hes ever had in a hotel. breakfast was brilliant, didnt need to eat lunch. staff were helpful and polite. the only negative were the toilet rolls, bit on the hard side. do go to gauchos argentinian steakhouse on damraat, best steak ever, the chicken was good too. also find your way to the hard rock cafe, near leidseplein wonderful food, lovely staff and if you like rock music you cant beat it. another good trip is the heineken museum.

<Content>Small but convenient Stayed here three nights in early April 2007. The main feature of the hotel is the location, you can't get more central than this in Amsterdam (you are within walking distance of all tourist attractions of the city centre).As other users have commented, the rooms are small and mine was no exception, although it had a window (which some of the other rooms apparently lack). There was air-conditioning (remote controlled individual split-cycle unit in the room, which was however not working quite evenly, and sometimes the room would change temperature suddenly without changes having been made to the air-conditioner.The place was spotless, and Internet access is available in the room at extra cost per 24 hours (using my own laptop; apparently the flat-panel TV in the room also has Internet capability).I would stay here again, mainly because it is close to everything and the hotel is in good shape and clean.

<Content>Good Location - Not Great Value! Just returned with friends and we could not check into this hotel as it was fully booked. They were not impressed at all and think we had a lucky escape when we saw their rooms! Not good value for money at all - not a 4* hotel. More like a 2/3*. Only thing going for it was the central location.

<Content>Good Location, small rooms The hotel is in a good location at the Dam Square. Internet service is available in the rooms but is very expensive at 鈧?5 per day. However, the hotel has a package where you can get Internet and unlimted in-room movies for 鈧?7.50 per day.My room was very tiny. Literally 7 feet by 13 feet. It was fine for one person but definitely the smallest room I have ever stayed in. Housekeeping service was excellent and the room was clean and functional.One of the nice things about this hotel is its no-marijuana policy so you do not smell the smoke like in other Amsterdam hotels.

<Content>Location, Location, Location.............! Booked this hotel via the Internet as we had already won the free flights. I had never been to Amsterdam before so wasn't really sure location wise what I was booking.As it happened, this hotel couldn't be in a better location, right on the corner of Dam Square and Damrak, the main road to the station and for restaurants. It was fantastic. We had a room on the 4th floor with juliet balconies on the windows overlooking Dam Square, couldn't have asked for better. The staff were very, very helpful and even when we requested a late check out, they sorted it no problem with no charge, even though it stated in the hotel guide an extra charge would be made. The rooms were quite small but more than adequate for a long weekend. The air-con was somewhat efficient, but as the weather was boiling outside, was quite welcome! The beds were very comfy and the bathroom was more than good enough. The hotel didn't have a bar, although there was a public restaurant downstairs, the food looked quite expensive. We used the minibar for any drinks/snacks we wanted, wasn't too expensive like the rest of Amsterdam, 3eur for a beer for example.Amsterdam itself is a fantastic place, with more than enough to see and do. We took a trip round the canals and went to various odd museums you won't find anywhere else. The red light district is also a must see!!There are 300 'coffee shops' around, so the place has a very distinct smell wherever go!!! The best place we found was The Grasshopper and 2 min walk from the hotel with a bar upstairs and a coffee shop downstairs and had a wonderful outside terrace where you could drink or smoke or do both if required!!!!I can't wait to go back and would definately stay at the same hotel again and would recommend it to anyone.Everyone is so friendly

<Content>a bit pricey for what it is Saw this hotel available on ratestogo for 285 euros for two nights at hotel. i paid 30 euros deposit on the net and was due to pay 255 euros on arrival. you could imagine my surprise when the guy on reception said he wanted 400 euros off me. he said the 30 euros i had paid was deposit for the booking company . THE CHEEK. It was only when i refused to pay that he gave me the room at the price i had been given. Once i got in the room it was small so i thought it was pricey really and i didnt even think about using phone or restaurant due to extortionate prices. Location was second to none but overall very pricey

<Content>Loved it! We booked directly through the hotel using the website, after calling to confirm that rooms were available. More than we had planned on spending; however, all of the other cheaper hotels we called insisted they were fully booked even though several travel websites showed availabilty, so we would have ended up with a confirmation but without a place to sleep if it weren't for the Red Lion.At check in we were greeted by a friendly and professional receptionist, and upgraded to a Superior room with a balcony overlooking Dam Square. On Sunday we had fantastic views of a parade from the comfort of our bed - a real treat!The staff was friendly, the room clean and comfortable (if slightly business-y), with a full bath, plenty of hot water, and a tv that worked. The location couldn't have been better, and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Overall a brilliant choice if you're prepared to pay a bit extra instead of resigning yourself to the cheaper - and consequently grubbier - options. This was our 5th time in Amsterdam, and the first we actually hung out in and enjoyed our room.We will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great, can;t relaly fault the place I can't really fault this hotel. Only a 5 minute walk from Central Station, and right on the door step of Dam square. The hotel was clean, and quiet from the hussle and bustle of the street outside. We got upgraded to a superior room from a standard, which as far as I can gather just meant we had 2 chairs and a table extra. The only disappointing bit about the room was the bed was 2 singles pushed together. We didn't eat at all in the hotel as we were room only, but there are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the area that can fulfill any budget or food requirement.Would I recommend this hotel ? Yes I would. The location is very central with some fantastic buildings surrounding it. I don't think the hotel tries to oversell itself, its just clean, comfortable and got a good location.

<Content>unbeatable Location I had booked 3 rooms via Priceline, and had then contacted the hotel directly asking if I could have the rooms close together. Rene Wildeman replied immediately and the reservations department got back to me letting me know they would try to put us together, and then offered us an upgrade for $31 per night per room. We accepted it, and was glad we did since I saw a regular room later on and it was tiny. I am pretty sure our luggage would not fit in there.We took the train from Schipol to Central Station and then walked the straight road to the hotel. It was about 7 mins away. Check in was prompt, the desk people were very friendly and the rooms were ok. They were dark since they were in the back with no view at all but the size of the rooms were amazing. I did not like the toiletries that came with the hotel however. The shampoo felt like watered down laundry detergent. I would recommend taking your own supply. Also, a warning, be careful of what you sign up for as wireless internet. We were told to open the internet page and follow instructions to sign up for internet. Well, we turned on my laptop and Tmobile came up. So we signed up for it, and lost signal right after that. Turns out that was not what the hotel offered. So, I will now have to dispute those charges since the connection was bad and I did not get access at all except for the first few mins it needed the credit card number. The beds were very comfortable, the toilet paper felt like sandpaper :)The location was unbeatable. It was in the middle of the tourist section. After I saw where the Crowne Plaza and Marriott was located, I was glad I won the Red Leeow bid, since we like being in the center of touristy things and this was it. The RDL was literally a block away, we could be there in about 5 mins. Loved Extase coffee shop, people in Amsterdam were so so friendly I cant begin to say enough!Remember to buy water from the supermarket near Madame Tussauds, much cheaper than anywhere else. We were charged city taxes of 5.66 euros per night per room. Room service was quick and efficient. Only once did we come back and see that housekeeping had kept a bag of trash on the bathroom sink and had forgotten to remove it, however someone came up in seconds after I called the front desk and had it cleared and kept on aplogizing. There was an electric kettle in the rooms with cups, coffees, teas, sugar and creamer. The only thing I did not like was the absence of an iron in the room. I was told we would need to go to the ironing room on the third floor to iron...which felt wierd. We also asked if we could keep one room till about 1pm and check out from the other two rooms since our flight was at 5pm and we were planning to leave the hotel around 2pm. The desk agent was very quick to say no and it was abrupt, if the other agents had not been nice I would have had a problem with it.Anyway, it was a good hotel, not to be compared to a 4 star in the US but good...I would recommend the hotel but remember it might be a good idea to take the upgrade if offered and it is reasonable.

<Content>Great location The Hotel is very handy for Central Station , Dam Square , Canals and Damrak. It has been recently refurbished our room and furnishings were very clean. The individual air conditioning and double glazing were a real bonus as we were there during the heat wave in mid July. Staff were very courteous, and being late risers we enjoyed breakfasts in our room. We found that the continental breakfasts were more than adequate, but there was the option of additional cooked breakfast for about 3 euros extra each. The main restaurant serves a good selection of traditional Dutch meals in the evenings.Recommend this hotel for location and price.

<Content>not a good hotel i stayed in this hotel at the end of may and was expecting a great place after reading some reviews but was not happy with what i found. The 2 girls at the reception were not helpfull and made us wait untill 2 when the chek in starts even though after reading reviews on this site and others many people were checked in straight away, in the morning. We were also made to wait a few times to see the staff at the reception because they were too busy serving other guests even though we were in line before them.(this happend when we were checking out). The rooms were cleaned everyday but i think all they were doing was making the beds and vacuming the room, they do not change the sheets in the bed like they do in every other hotel i have stayed in, even do this in 2 star hotels. the man who looks after the bags made us wait about 20 mins to get our bags when we were checking out which is very poor service. the room was good though becuase we had a small balcony which was over looking damrak and we could see dam sq. it was not noisey either which was good. overall this hotel is in a good location with decent rooms (although they are on the small side)..... but i have to say the service is poor and the reception looks very tacky not like something you would expect to see in a 4 star hotel... it looks very cheap. in september i stayed in the Avenue hotel which is only bout 3 - 5 min walk from dam sq.... it was half the price, the service was 10x better, the room was much better and it actually felt like you were staying in a hotel not the big brother house with security cameras everywhere you look, which was another thing i disliked about this hotel. This hotel would be good if it was cheaper, we ended up paying 500 euros for 3 nights for 2 people, but we did order a lot of room service and used the mini bar but it was still a rip of for what you get. I WOULD NOT STAY HERE look somewhere else.

<Content>This place sucked After being bumped from the hd Doolen hotel on a lovely canel in Amsterdam we were, I feel, tricked into accepting a room in the Amsterdam Red Lion hotel (located in the DAM right next to a noisy, smelly McDonalds). When it was time to leave, we bought our tickets for the Shuttle (there's a sign in the lobby that states we pick up at this hotel) after purchasing the tickets at 10:15 am (our flight was at 23:00) we asked if the shuttle would pull up in front, we were told yes. That was not true, as the shuttle picks up across the DAM. Because of the ill communication and simply poor customer service we received at the hotel we missed our flight and ended up spending another $139.00+ euros (about $195.00 dollars) finding another hotel for the night.Even though this hotel is rated a 4 star, it's obviously for people who don't make it a habit to stay in better places. If you don't care about service and reliability pick this place, If you do -- run as fast as you can to another one. I also find it very interesting that I con't find a customer service link to complain and ask for restitution.

<Content>Ok Hotel We stayed here for a long weekend in Amsterdam. The location is very good as you are close to all the sites and the train station. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly but the rooms were a little grubby and the frosted glass door on the bathroom was strange to say the least. The rooms were a bit noisy as you could hear people in the hall and doors closing; the walls were paper thin, we could hear someone cough in the next room! The room was a little on the small side. The hotel restaurant was very good, the food was reasonably priced, very good and the waiter was great.The staff belonged in a 4 star hotel, which this is most certainly not.

<Content>Awesome Location makes up for an ok hotel We stayed at The Red Lion for a weekend get away. We flew in and took the train to Centraal Station and walked to the hotel. Even though it was freezing in Amsterdam the walk was quick and the hotel was very easy to find. The hotel is located right next to Dam Square and the tram stops directly in front of the hotel. This made for easy access to any part of the city! It also made it easy to wander around and still find your way back since it is located on Dam Square.The Hotel itself was ok. We were upgraded to a Jr suite for an extra 鈧?0 a night. I would not recommend this. The room we were in was a conference room with a Murphy bed and ceiling to floor windows looking out onto a brick wall and A/C unit for the building. The staff were helpful. Not out going but not rude. We did not eat at the Restaurant so I can't review on that. But based on the price and the location I will definitely stay in the hotel again while in Amsterdam. The reason for the 4 rating on this review is the fact that our suite was a conference room complete with projector screen and extra office chairs. I would not recommend upgrading to a jr suite. They also charge for EVERYTHING in the room! So if you need your tea, like me, I suggest bringing some along!

<Content>Wonderful hotel and staff We just got back from a week in Amsterdam, staying at the Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw. From the minute we checked in, everything was great. The staff was always more than helpful and all spoke English. Our room included a wonderful breakfast in a beautiful Old World dining room....the service was flawless (in fact, after a couple of days, they always knew what we wanted to drink) The hotel is VERY centrally located on Dam Square. The room was always clean and made up. Also try the dining room on the 3rd floor of the department store directly across the street from the hotel for lunch....we will definitely stay here every time we go back to Amsterdam. GREAT VALUE!!

<Content>Fantastic location, great hotel! Don't pay full price. My husband and I travel regularly for business and leisure, and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam. As long as you get a good deal on the price, you can't go wrong.It's location is perfect - right on Dam Square, seconds away from the Royal Palace, Madame Tussaud's (which I also recommend), museums, tours, shopping, restaurants, and the infamous Red Light District. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. I would advise that if you plan on sleeping in in the mornings, don't forget to put out the Do not Disturb sign as the cleaning staff are up early and very persistent. The hotel had a few english speaking TV news and entertainment channels available, and the TV was a nifty little flatscreen. The choice of movies was fairly good too. Only negative point: The room was small. We only saw the standard (or comfortable) room, so I don't know how much bigger the superior rooms were. If you get the choice, ask for a room with a bath as the bathroom will be bigger and the shower is attached anyway. The double bed was two single beds pushed together, and the only other things that could fit in the room were a desk and a chair. But that aside, the room was clean, not completely out-dated, reasonably quiet, and perfect for falling asleep in after a big day out.We booked the room online for around 拢60 ($100USD) per night. This was about half the average price quoted on this site at the time, and way way way below the price on their web site. So considering the excellent location, staff, and price, the size of the room was easy to overlook. If you do get a good deal on this hotel, and you are prepared for the room to be small, you will absolutely not be disappointed. I would definitely stay here again.A few helpful tips:#1. The English name for the hotel is The Red Lion. I found it was easier to say this than pronounce the Dutch name.#2. There is a shuttle bus from the airport. It costs 12 euro per person and drops you off across the square from the hotel. A taxi is about 35 euro (but be careful because the taxi drivers in Amsterdam will try to con you). The train to Central Station is only around 4 euro and it is about a 15-20 minute walk up the main street to the hotel. A cheap option if you have very little baggage. #3. Breakfast at the hotel is 11 euro. That sounds expensive, but that's what you'll end up paying in a similar setting elsewhere in the area. However, the restaurant is very, very smokey, and the food isn't that great. I advise exploring the neighbourhood for meals.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Amsterdam We booked a package (no longer available) for the Hotel Amsterdam and with all the freebies and perks, it actually worked out to less Euros than some of the other 4 star hotels. We had a junior suite which was huge, as well as a large bathroom with tub and shower. Package included buffet breakfast each morning, a free canal boat cruise and two tickets to the Van Gogh Museum. Staff was friendly and great at providing information and suggestions. Our suite was right on Damrak, but the windows are truly soundproof. Comfortable bed and big-screen TV.Unfortunately, we probably won't get to stay here next time, as it is really pricey without all the items included in the package.But if your budget allows it, you will probably like this hotel. We did.

<Content>Very comfortable stay We have just returned from our first visit to Amsterdam on a mid-week break. We booked the 'Red Lion Package' and received excellent value for the money we paid. The room was large and spacious and very comfortable with a king size bed and sitting area. The buffet breakfast was good and included in the package price. One evening meal was included also in the package and the choices were from the usual menu not a cheap limited selection as one often finds with 'deals'. The food was excellent so we actually decided to return again the following evening. The only criticism was that we forgot our travel adaptor so borrowed one for a 'small' charge from reception. The small charge was 10 euros on the final bill!! All in all a good trip and would certainly return again.

<Content>Wouldn't Recommend a Single Room Here.... I booked a single room online and got a pretty good deal so I didn't expect a premium room but...it was tiny! The entire room was no more than 7 feet wide and 9 feet long and the bathroom was so small that the tub was 4x4 square and the space for the toilet left about 6 inches on either side. If I were a 200 lb., 6 foot tall man, I would've injured myself using that bathroom. When I arrived, there were 2 towels in my room: one hand towel and one bath towel. They promptly brought up more when asked but they took the extra towels away every time they cleaned the room.The hotel itself was a bit rundown and desperately needs updating. Everything was clean but threadbare.Bottom line: if you like being in the middle of a busy, touristy area (like Times Square) this is a good location but don't stay in a single room if you're claustraphobic and/or prefer furnishings that are more recent than 1979.I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Island of Calm on Dam Square My wife and I stayed two nights in this lovely, boutique hotel. It was right off of Dam Square on Damrak, a great location to wander Amsterdam from. The staff were helpful, and service was good. The room had a view of the Square, but was large, clean, and quiet. The bathroom door, being frosted glass, is a bit disconcerting to Americans, but not really unusual in Europe. On the first floor, the De Roode Leeuw Restaurant is charmingly decorated and serves Dutch traditional food, it is worth a dinner stop. --- and drugs are big visiting points to this liberal city. Be careful in the old section at night. We enjoyed the Jordaan and Western Canal ring, only a ten minute walk from the hotel. We were happy that we did not have a rental car, parking is difficult at best.

Bathroom was really big, new tiles and very nice overall. Room was really big, very clean, all new furnishings, very quiet and very safe.Hotel is very close to all Amsterdam attractions - bus tours, boat tours, Central station, Dam square, canals, trams, buses, trains.It is a nice hotel for people traveling alone or with families. We stayed with a small kid. Hotel decor is very very clean.If we go to Amsterdam, we would stay there. It's a 4-star hotel quality.Would recommend to all travelers.

I stayed there in late jan 2005 as a single traveller, got a great deal of 85 euro per night, and upon arrival, got upgraded into a double room! The room was at the back corner of the building, very spacious, and the state of the bathroom impressed me. Yes, it may not look like your average 4 star hotel, but the staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect!! Makes it very easy for me to walk out to the Dam Square at mid-night just to take pictures of the snow!I would definetly stay there again when I return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Didn't need mass transit-Perfect Location Reviewed many hotels before picking this one. The location as perfect, because it was right next to the Dam Square, two blocks up from the Central Train Station.The rooms were small compared to American types, but it did not matter. They were clean, well kept and warm (30 degrees outside). We had a corner on the top at the back. It turned out to be the best spot. With snow we got some great shots of the roofline of other building. Plus we were above a major shopping street and could see when it was best to go down and join in the crowd. It was totally quiet. This is where I will be staying when I return in May.Found a great deal for about $130 US per night!

<Content>Not even close to 4 stars. On seeing this hotel with a 4 star rating, I booked for a weekend in march 05. This hotel is located centrally, but should be noted that it is not a 4 star hotel. Infact it would not get 1 star in my opinion. I travel Europe regulary and have never stayed in a smaller room. This was a cell, not a hotel room. Whatever rating system is in place here is a joke. It is expensive for a cell too. They are charging 3 star prices, but you get a 1 star experience. If you have to stay here, just beware it is not even close to European 4 star standard.

<Content>Fantastic hotel Stayed at the Red Lion for a weekend with my girlfriend in February. Perfect location to explore the city by day and night. Room was small but very well decorated, great view of one of the cities major streets, but not noisy. Half a minute walk to Dam Square and all sorts of restaurants and bars. Staff were very helpful, hotel was immaculately clean.I can't recommend this place enough for a weekend break in Amsterdam!

<Content>I'd stay again, depending on the rate I found a really good deal for three nights (330 Eur. total) on the hotel's own website, hotelamsterdam.nl. I requested a smoking room, which was ready when I got there at about 10:00 AM. It was kind of dingy, which I chalk up to the fact that it was a smoking room, and the bed wasn't very comfortable, but it was clean enough. The room had two large windows, which opened into a balcony, which I just loved - I really lucked out in that aspect, because most of the rooms apparently don't have one. I never got around to trying the food there. My favorite thing about this hotel is the location. Just feet away from Dam Square, which made wandering around the city really easy, and a lot of tram lines stop either right in front or just around the corner. If I make it back to Amsterdam, and can get a similar rate, I'd be glad to stay again.

<Content>Singles beware! I used to be a regular guest of this controversial hotel, mainly because it's one of the very few in Amsterdam that offers a wired high speed Internet access in every room. However, it proved to be almost impossible to survive more than one day in its 鈥渟olitary cells.鈥?So I began to book double rooms instead, paying the higher room rate. But these too never were really comfortable. It was only until recently that I realized what was going on. Last September I arrived twice for stays of two and five days in double rooms. Both times the (friendly) receptionist replied to my question about the type of room I was given: 鈥淚t's a superior single鈥? and added that it was a large room. The first time I accepted this because the stay was short and I was curious about the quality of the accommodation. Well, the room had twin beds with a few square centimeters more space around them than the average single room. Upon the second arrival I was of course not willing to accept the inferior room type again. A rude guy who is not often seen at the front desk intervened and offered me a free upgrade to a double room. How generous. An upgrade to what I had actually booked and guaranteed by credit card! The room I got then was better than any of the other ones I had been given in the past.It seems that the hotel silently changes the reservations of individual travelers. Most guests probably don't verify the room type upon arrival. So they remain unaware of the overcharging. This presumably happened to me quite a few times before I started to ask questions.Due to the ongoing tourism boom in Amsterdam, the demand for hotel rooms is constantly high. As a consequence, many hotels have become greedy and don't care about business integrity. My confidence into the 鈥淩ed Lion鈥?is gone and I will look for another place in the future.
