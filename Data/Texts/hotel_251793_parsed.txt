<Content>Trendy and Stylish, but not annoyingly so We stayed at the Ku'damm 101 for two nights in December 2008. The hotel is very stylish and features modern industrial-style design but, despite this was a very comfortable and welcoming place to stay. Our room was huge, clean and very quiet. The breakfast room on the 7th floor gave superb views over the city and the breakfast itself was excellent. The staff were helpful and friendly. As for location, it's really only 5-10 minutes' walk from the Adenauer Platz U-Bahn station (get off there if you are getting the 109 bus from Tegel airport) and the surrounding area is very safe and pleasant, with lots of nearby restaurants. I'd wholly recommend this as a place to stay in Berlin

<Content>Love the hotel but location is a bit out of the way I really liked this place. It wouldn't be to everyone's taste as it's quite industrial in design. We had a very large bedroom. Good breakfasts. The staff were very helpful and went to a lot of trouble to book a restaurant for us when we were having problems finding a place. Although I really liked the hotel and the area it was in I would probably look for something a little more central the next time. Yes, you can get the bus or train easily but that does take up precious time if you are in the city for a weekend.

<Content>Ku'Damm 101 Review A neutral review this one. It's not that central, or close to an underground train line. It's reasonably stylish and modern, though is starting to show signs of wear overall - certainly no longer cutting edge.However the room rates aren't too bad, public transport in Berlin is excellent and crucially, it's stumbling distance from one of the worlds best cocktail bars, the Universum Lounge.One for couples and groups overall I think. I've stayed 4 or 5 times and never had any problem with staff or any other issues.

<Content>Not that great The hotel was okay, but no more than that. First, it's NOT central (despite what some of the reviews say) and although the bus stop is right outside and takes you into the centre or to pick up the UBahn it would have been better to be closer in. It was very clean, but the rooms are sparse and not somewhere to do anything but sleep: not even a comfy chair! My room had a balcony which was good, except that it was shared by all the rooms on the 6th floor so that if you wanted privacy you had to keep the net curtains drawn. The staff were very friendly but check-in wasn't smooth: I arrived at 1.30 and was told to come back at 3.00 -okay, I was early but surely there was a clean room somewhere? When I returned at 3.45 the room still wasn't ready. Breakfast, though was really good with some unusual things which changed every day. There are several restaurants in the area, including a Greek restaurant where the waiter bore a disturbing resemblance to David Walliams! I got a 3 nights for 2 deal with Hotel Connect, but otherwise it would have been quite expensive. On balance, it's an okay place to stay but no more than that.

<Content>Love it every time I go there! In the last 2 years I have spent 2 weekends at this hotel and both times I thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel has a clear and moden design and the staff is very friendly and tries to fulfill every wish (one night we were bored and the weather was bad, so we got a DVD player delivered into our room and we could choose from several DVDs for a very low charge). Their recommendations for restaurants have always been precisly that what we have asked for. There are 2 things to highlight at the Kudamm 101: you eat your breakfast looking over Berlin (the breakfast room is situated at the top floor of the Hotel) and the barkeeper has always been happy to create personal cocktails for everyone who couldn't decide what to choose from the long cocktail list. Although the Kudamm is situated at the wrong side of the Kudamm, it is nevertheless only a 15 min walk to get to the central shopping area of Berlin and there are several tube stations along the Kudamm that get you everywhere in no time at all. Overall the Kudamm has been one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in and I am already looking forward to staying there again!

<Content>Rather sterile, like we found berlin The hotel is trendy in a minimalistic, clean sort of way. Perfectly adequate for overnight stays, but probably better suited to business professionals - who were dominant at breakfast, as it's not the type of place to lounge comfortably around in, especially as all the TV channels are in German and there's no mini-bar, kettle, or even drinking water in the room! The nearest tube/Ubahn station is a good 10 min walk - and about 4 changes from the airport - better to go to the Halensee S-bahn station which is only one change from the airport. We asked for recommendations to a lively cafe for lunch and had a 1/2 hour journey to find one (walk  tube). KaDeWe, the major dept store is on the Ku'damm, but right at the other end - 3 tube stops and a good walk.Overall the hotel matched our opinion of Berlin - sterile. If we'd been more impressed by Berlin, the hotel would have been fine as a base, but we found it a hard city to find any life in - perhaps we went at the wrong time of year?? We won't be back to find out. Recommend you go to Rome, Paris or Stockholm instead - much more to do, see and experience!

<Content>Still rolling - great hotel Second time in this nice, minimal style hotel, i stayed in september 2004 and 2007, wonderful breakfast at the top floor overviewing the roofs of the Ku'damm aerea, the rooms are clean, beds comfortable everything works and well mantained. Hotel at walking distance from various touristically interesting spots, well served by bus, a minute from famous shopping area.Personell are all young and happy looking, it may be that during this period the hotel is mostly occupied by people working in the music trade, i don't know but its reassuring to know that every time i needed something reception solved it with a smile.I recommend Ku'damm with no reserve.p.s.I had a great dinner at a close by Portuguese restaurant.

<Content>Very nice Stayed only one night. The staff were happy to accommodate our last-minute request for hypo-allergenic bedding. Breakfast was a great way to start the day on the 7th floor - it was a shame we were in a hurry to catch a flight back to NYC and we did not get to relax and enjoy it as much as we would have liked. The hotel is not super fancy or upscale, but it is clean and the value for money was definitely there. We got a great deal from www.tablethotels.com and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Just average I normally follow advice on Tripadvisor, but this time I was rather disappointed. I found the hotel not bad but not excellent either. First of all, it is a design hotel, but when you think design think rather IKEA than Philip Starck or Alvar AAlto. It is essentially very basic but painted in interesting colours - it could be a luxury hostel. Of course I am not fond of artificial flowers or carpets or pink bathrooms, but here I got to miss them. The corridors are a bit hospital-like, the floor in cement is very cold (bring slippers), bath amenities are very basic. The good points are undoubtedly the very nice and smiling staff at reception and the smart breakfast. Besides, don't be confused by the apparently central address - given the very peculiar (circular) way of street numbering in Berlin, the hotel is actually at the very end of Ku'damm, which makes it very inconvenient if your main centres of interest are in the new (Eastern) centre.

<Content>Great Place Excellent hotel. Very stylish and spotlessly clean but it is pretty basic.. The well being room is huge with comfy beds and a very cool TV set. However, complimentary stuff is rather sparse, so I would suggest bringing your own toiletries and don't expect tea / coffee making facilities. The breakfast was of an excellent standard - very wide and fresh selection of stuff, including lots of different types of teas, breads, meats, eggs  cheeses. Aesthetically, it is a very well designed and funky hotel with great touches around the place, well worth staying at!!

<Content>Great Hotel but... This hotel is great, I loved the design and layout of the rooms and the lobby however make sure you are adamant about getting a room with air conditioning if you want one because I booked a room asking for such and didn't receive it. To me it isn't as big a deal as can be for some so make sure that if you really do want/need AC that you double check you have it. Otherwise this is a great hotel the beds are wonderful and the service is likewise. Trip Advisor did not let me down!

<Content>Very Disappointing Marketed as a hip hotel, I guess it was the 100% wrong choice. Although staff were very professional (with funny trousers) and helpful, the hotel's aesthetics are placed ahead of comfort. Laid-back sounds and delicate food don't make up for the lack of a kettle in room and fry-up for breakfast. I had stayed two previous nights in the Excelsior (Hardenburg Str) and would recommend that as my preferred choice. Will definately NOTconsider Ku'damm in my future trips to Berlin.

<Content>loved it there, modern, trendy, friendly and clan reception was good, friendly and efficient.room was small but enough for two, bed was comfortable and bathroom clean and modern. No complaints. Tea and Coffee making facilities in room would have been a bonus. They did leave complimentary bottled water each morning though.Breakfast was very nice and different to what i had in other hotels. A mix of normal stuff, with nice touches like Smoked Salmon, fresh pate and a range of nice cheeses. Breakfast was great.It has a nice bar by the reception, which is always great for a nice drink before bedtime. Again, trendy and clean.Location was good, on 50 metres to the S-bahn, a bus stopped right outside which took you to the Europe centre and U-bahn was not too far away. Not a bad location at all (trust me, i have stayed in alexanderplatz on a previous stay, now that is a bad location).So for the price, 5 stars due to the small price you pay, you feel you should be paying much more.

It was my fourth time staying at this lovely hotel  once again my stay was excellent!Something that many people don't do in Berlin is buy a city map or get an S Bahn - U Bahn map  Bus Routes map.If they do that they will quicly realise that the closest S-Bahn station is only 150 meters away from the hotel (Halensee S Bahn Station) from there you can go everywhere extremely fast .Also there are so many Metro Buses stoping directly outside the hotel that take you directly to the heart of the city that transportation is absolutely no problem.

<Content>Just one word.....excellent We stayed at Ku'Damm 101 on our annual trip to Berlin this year and having stayed a number of 4  5 star hotels in the city, I'd rate this as one of the better ones. Although not soft and luxurious (the minimalist design concept may put a number of people off), our room was spotlessly clean and very quiet. Breakfast (included in the rate) was excellent. I can't agree with the other reviewers who had an issue with the location of the hotel. There is an excellent bus service that will take you to the other end of the Ku'Damm in around 5 minutes. As Berlin is a big city, you need to use public transport anyway.We'd definitely stay again.

<Content>very comfortable rooms we loved the design - every corner/room has a new surprise inclusive of entry, garden, lounge. Nice view from the balcony at the breakfast floor. Clean, large room with excellent bathroom and beds. Breakfast was surprisingly good and wonderfully presented. Fresh atmosphere all around. Berlin is very big so pay attention to what you want to visit and where to go at night and take this into account when searching for a hotel. Subway connections are good but be prepared to travel around and away from the center.

<Content>Great style, great value All in all, i thought this hotel was terrific. The rooms are VERY minimalist, so if that's not your aesthetic, then you might not like it. The staff was hit or miss in terms of friendliness and helpfulness, but overall, most were pretty nice. The rooms were quite a comfortable size and the breakfast was wonderful. No restaurant, but a good bar with a friendly staff and a few small dishes in case you got hungry.All in all, it's amazing value for the money. I stayed here twice, and got a slightly better deal by booking through Expedia rather than directly. I didn't see a big difference between the two classes of double rooms. I will say that the location is not all that convenient, generally speaking. It's at the western end of Berlin, away from most of the sights.

<Content>Cool but Inconvenient The Ku'Damm 101 was a very cool, minimalist hotel in a quiet area, however the hotel itself was not quiet and the neighborhood was inconvenient to most of the sights I wanted to see. One problem that modern, no-carpet, spare hotels seem to have is the amount of noise that carries from room to room and in the halls. Tje first two of five nights I was there I could hear doors slamming all morning and night which irritated me. The breakfast spread was wonderful and the top floor, sunny location of the dining room was a joy to start the day in. Had the hotel been in a central location, I would still recommend it, but if you are planning to hit the sights and hang out more often in the Mitte section of town, stay somewhere more central. I spent a good 1/2 hour to 45 minutes every day one-way getting to where I wanted to go. I did a lot of schlepping and in the rain it wasn't too pleasant. Their really is not much at all of interest in the local area.

<Content>Spartan chic and a good value Stayed at the Ku'damm 101 in December of 2004, and had a very nice stay. I had booked one of the larger rooms with queen size beds, on an upper floor. I was very impressed with the finish of the space -- it is very austere, but stylishly so, and the design touches (e.g., the stylish subway tile bathroom, light switches integrated into the bed, and cordless phone) were very much appreciated. Christmastime decor was lovely -- practically a forest of fragrant trees in the lobby (undecorated, befitting the sparse decor).The location is not fantastic -- it is sort of at the wrong end of the Ku'damm, and not too close to a subway stop -- but not terrible; there is frequent bus service if you don't feel like taking a few blocks' hike. Breakfast was terrific, with good selections of cold cuts, yogurt, fruit, juices, and various teas, among others -- not sure what others are complaining about.In the end, I felt it was a very good value for what I paid. I'd go back.

<Content>Great hotel, refreshingly different The Ku鈥橠amm 101 is a refreshing change from the dreariness of standard 4-5 star hotels. It is a bold statement in favour of modernity (with comforts), simplicity and style. The lobby is quirky with a nice round bar and a long table (at the back) for communal conversation; modern art works are scattered throughout, so the impression is that of an art gallery, rather than your run of the mill hotel lobby. After you are handed out your key, which is in fact an electronic tag that you need to use even to operate the lift, you enter a hotel room which is worlds apart from chintz, velvet and plastic fripperies. The floors are uncarpeted (spotless of course) and tones of grey, soft green and beige plus clever lighting, turn the room into a relaxing environment. Bathrooms are also extremely modern and efficiently designed so that you have everything, but without the clutter. My only concern, given the design of the shower, was how the maid could possibly clean it, but it was spotless so they must have thought of a way of doing it! After a comfortable night, I took myself to their breakfast room which is located on the 7th floor, unusual but yet again refreshingly different as you are projected into an airy room with views of the city. Do not expect your run of the mill breakfast; it鈥檚 more akin to nouvelle cuisine with emphasis on vegetarian living, than a traditional hearty early morning fare. This may disappoint you somewhat if you are not into fresh fruit and yoghurts and prefer instead bacon and eggs (you have a choice of eggs, but no bacon!). As this hotel makes a statement you either love it to bits, which I did, or possibly hate. If you are into leather armchairs, flock wallpaper, knick-knacks and Victoriana you shouldn鈥檛 even think of this place; if you favour instead a more contemporary life style and a change from dreary business hotels, go for it and you will be hooked for ever.

<Content>Ku'Damm 101 - Superb Stayed for five nights at the Ku'Damm 101 at the end of March-06 / start of April-06. Lovely hotel. Excellent rooms, superb breakfast and a great bar.Rooms - large, beautifully furnished (might be too modern and minimilistic for some tastes though). Excellent bathroom, very nicely furnished and a great large, walk-in shower (no bath, but not an issue for me).Breakfast - brilliant. Great choice of fresh fruit, cereals, eggs, differnt types of salmon, meat, cheese, breads, juices, teas, coffee etc.... all very fresh and superbly presented.Bar - cool, nicely furnished and great cocktails. Nothing like as expensive as most hotel bars I've drunk in.Staff - excellent. Helpful, polite and knowledgeable.Location - good. Not right in the centre, but the Berlin public transport system is excellent, very cheap and easy to use. Three stations all within 5-10 minute walk and a very good and regular bus service right outside the hotel!

<Content>Ku'damm Cool We stayed here for five nights on our first trip to Berlin.We had no problems with the check-in, and the staff were very helpful and polite throughout our stay.The room, whilst not the biggest we've stayed in, was clean and comfortable, with all necessary amenities. A kettle would have been nice though. [You can apparently get a minibar delivered to your room, but we didn't try it, preferring to buy bottled beer from the local supermarket, and keep it cold on the windowsill!]Travelling from here to anywhere in Berlin was a doddle, with the bus stop just outside the hotel, or Halensee S-Bahn a couple of minutes down the road. Just get your 'Tageskart' and you'll be sorted for the whole day's travel.Whilst this is a more residential part of Berlin, there are plenty of restaurants and bars around we ate locally almost every night - the Korean place on the way to Halensee is worth a visit, and you're also only a 15 minute walk (or short S-Bahn ride) away from the cooler Savignyplatz, where the A-trane jazz club is also worth a visit.Breakfast. Man alive. The best I've ever seen, for continental anyways. Freshly baked bread  croissants, charcuterie, smoked salmon, good cheese selection, 6 types of juice, yoghurts and fresh fruit, about a dozen teas which you could brew yourself from loose leaves and free papers (good if you can read German!)The bar was also quite good, but the music was sometimes awful, and there was a bad draught from the front door when anyone came in. The drinks were a little expensive, but the snacks were reasonably priced. The only major disappointment was being unable to try the temptingly-translated 'Essence of Cabbage Turnip', which I assume was a Kohlrabi Soup, because the chef hadn't made any that day!All in all, highly recommended, and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderfull The 101 is an ultra modern and very trendy hotel. This said it was very welcoming and the staff could not have been more helpfull and courtious if they tried.The hotel is located at the wrong end of the beaten track, being slightly further out than I would normally stay. However Berlin is a large City and you cant be on top of everything wherever you stay, but the public transport system is next to none. There is a bus stop almost outside the hotel and from there you can link to anywhere with ease.Having read here about the breakfast buffet (included in price)I was not dissapointed at all, a great way to start your day and on Sunday breakfast is available to 1pm.Overall a great hotel with great staff. A little out of the way but should be no problem. Actually in a nice area.

<Content>Well worth a visit Just got back from 5 nights in Berlin, we stayed at the K101 and enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel is ideally placed for a visit to Berlin, right on the main shopping strip with all the designer shops you could need. Restaurants are a plenty and you could not go hungry. The breakfast in the hotel is good and you can help yourself which sets you up for plenty of sight seeing. The S-Bahn is a 10 min walk away and bus stops are a few hundred feet away from the front door. The hotel is very clean and modern in its appearance,the staff are 1st class and very helpfull. Free internet in lobby, bar prices are not expensive. Rooms very clean and comfy beds. We will definately pay another visit.

<Content>Kool Dam place! This hotel is very well thought-out in terms of the service, rooms and amenities. The very stylish, minimalist decor appears to have fallen straight out of the pages of 'Wallpaper' magazine. My room (404) had a very high ceiling and was bathed in relaxing, monochromatic grey-blue colors. The only thing off was that the gimmicky T.V. that rolls back and forth had left marks on the walls (from a prior guest). Also, I never figured how to adjust the T.V.'s contrast. Bathroom was spare but attractive; the bath head was adjustable for either bath or shower use. The only disappointment in the room was the lack of floor rugs (except for one small one)which gave the floors a Northern European hospital feel. Service was reliable and always pleasant. I booked on ---- and was pleased that the breakfast (about 15 euros) was included in the room rate. A word about the breakfast: it is the best buffet I have seen in any hotel. There are separate stations for coldcuts, cereal, eggs and even vegetarian offerings. Superb quality and, especially, presentation. There is a terrific view of Berlin from this 7th floor restaurant (breakfast only). The lobby bar is lively with guests (mainly Euros) and neighborhood types. There are 2 free internet terminals in the lobby (although no printer!). The location is in a mixed but nice commercial residential neighborhood. I do not recommend this hotel for 1st time visitors since it is a hike to the Adenauer U Bahn station (which doesn't have any direct trains to the prime tourist areas). The S Bahn stop is closer but transfers (some tricky) are still necessary. As a hotel professional (Concierge) I recommend this hotel for repeat and frequest Berlin visitors.

<Content>Excellent choice, superior than 4 1/2 I was totally impressed by this hotel. We did not expect much but we were blown away when we arrived. The decor is modern and chic, the room was impecable, the location perfect. The beds are very comfortable, the breakfast was delicious. The breakfast coffee was the best I had in Germany (did struggle to like coffe here after spending 3 days in Vienna...). All staff was truly professional. I can only say GREAT things about this hotel. During our trip we stayed at 5 star hotels but this one beat them easily when you compare pricing. We paid $65 pounds per night including breakfast!!! (lastminutetravel). It is super well located. Buses and metro are nearby so do not get deterred when people say that is OUT of the way. It is not. I'll go there again when visiting Belin.

<Content>Fantastic, one of the best paces we've stayed We had a great time at Ku'Damm 101! The room was great, modern and stylish but not austere. The staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly the bar staff. The bar is brilliant, again stylish but not stiff. The breakfast was great, really good range, all well displayed and served. I love it when a hotel has a good choice of breakfast beverages! And really good fruits! And a great choice of cooked eggs etc. And what a view!The location may be a little out of the way for those who aren't able bodied, but if you can walk five/ten mins to the underground, then it's ideal. And the Ku'Damm is a great place for a stroll. Oh, the pleasure of clean, efficient public transport that takes you where you want to go... well, Berlin is a joy, and so is Ku'Damm 101. If you don't stay there, you're missing out. We will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Place Myself and a friend stayed in the Ku'damn 101 in Berlin at the end of May this year (2005) and could not find fault with it. Great location, safe neighbourhood, very comfy beds, lovely bar with very cool and trendy music but which could not be heard from the rooms. Excellent breakfasts, we lingered way too long as a result but we didn't need lunch as they were so filling. Friendly staff...what more can I say? Approx 鈧?5 from the airport. Bathroom with the frosted glass not a problem. Only one minor thing, I didn't find the AC until our last morning as it was in a corner behind the wardrobe! Thank you for all the reviews as it makes it so much easier to pick hotels!

<Content>A little out of the way First off this is a no frills hotel with no frills staff. It may well be a designer hotel but when I read designer, I see minimalist which is what it is. The rooms are spartan and unexciting, and the breakfast is very much lite. The other real problem with this hotel is that it is right at the wrong end of the Ku'Damm and not really close to anything, even a subway stop.This is the kind of hotel that may appeal to people in their teens or early twenties, being as it is an expensive youth hostel. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic getaway, sightseeing or other holiday. See what rate you can get, and then take something for the same price in Mitte.

<Content>Cool and friendly For a hotel that has a reputation for being so cool, it was great to find that not only did the reality meet the expectation, but the staff were as cool as the decor, and equally as friendly.The rooms are undoutedly minimalist in nature but not so stark as to feel cold and unwelcoming. The high ceilings, well chosen furniture and even the rubber floors work perfectly. For a capital city the rooms are also a very generous size.And don't skip the breakfast! The views from the seventh floor are stunning as is the food. The idea of serving all the way up to 1pm on a Sunday is inspired.This certainly won't be the last time we visit.

<Content>very cool hotel very cool and trendy, but friendly and comfortable too. extremely clean. has a relaxed feel to it, the staff really want to look after you. the bar is great with excellent service, the bar man really took care when preparing a drink. handy internet access in reception. only slight problem was the fairly out of the way location. Berlin is huge however and the hotel is close to all local transport routes so easy enough to get to the rest of berlin. The breakfast is absolutely amazing, they have everything, and with an amazing view out of the window. breakfast is the best thing about the hotel. overall excellent and really good value for money.

<Content>Fantastic modern hotel I stayed at Ku' Damm 101 in February 2005. It is an amazing modern hotel which has been well designed - clean chic minimalist rooms with stunning ensuite bathrooms. The staff were some of the friendliest and most professional people I have ever met and made me feel very welcome. The buffet breakfast (on the 7th floor with great views over the city) was a proper feast (you will not need lunch!) and was complimented by the fresh flowers and candles on the tables. They do some great winter deals which mean you can get a double room with breakfast included for 81 euro a night - bargain!You can also indulge in spa treatments for an extra charge. I cannot recommend this place enough, it's brilliant!

<Content>Cool place to chill out This is a great hotel with a real strong design aesthetic. The bathrooms (with heated rubber floors and glass brick walls) are particularly hip. The buffet breakfast was excellent, with some really unusual salad options, as well as a good selection of meats, cheeses, breads and pastries. There's a funky DJ in the bar area on Friday nights too. The only downside is that it's a bit off the beaten track if you're only in Berlin for a short while, but there are some great restaurants nearby - especially Francucci's, which serves excellent freshly made pizzas, pastas and organic beefsteak.

<Content>Lived up to it's excellent reviews Greatly enjoyed our 3 night break in Berlin. Ku'Damn 101 was a perfect place from which to explore this interesting city. As has been described here before, this hotel is immaculate, stylish, modern and great attention has been paid to its minimal design. We found the young staff all extremely pleasant and helpful. The buffet breakfast was excellent. The hotel is situated a bus ride from the main centre and museums but there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby and the public transport system is very good.

<Content>Great Hotel! We have stayed in this beautiful hotel for a week during Sept.2004.The staff was very helpfull and our room was FANTASTIC.It was on the top floor and looked like a bauhaus exhibition.Breakfast was great and the location of the hotel ,while not very central ,quite convenient (there is a Bus Stop outside the hotel  Adenauer U bahn station is a 10 min.walk on the beautiful Kudamm)HIGHLY recommended!

<Content>Fabulous Decor throughout! Its lobby and rooms are VERY COOL !!The location is great and the Reception Desk Staff is friendly.The breakfasts (included in the room rate) are nice... although the staff doesn't seem to project any hospitality or warmth.If you're expecting service with a smile.... when going to the 7th floor for breakfast, you will be disappointed. So, do what we did: IGNORE the attitude of the persons staffing the dining room and ENJOY the food and the view!If you're a lover of mid-twentieth century design and ambience, the Ku'Damm 101 is for you!!

<Content>feels as cold as the staff's attitudes this place has all the charm of an eastern european mental asylum. I stayed for 4 very long days in september. has a very cold feel to the place and non german speakers beware - only 1 English speaking tv channel (CBS Business report - yawn) which made for some extremely dull nights. it is well placed on kudammstrasse though I suspect that the strive for minimalist chic has overlooked basic comfort.

<Content>Lukewarm chic Stayed here in early December 2005. Ok, it's only a 3-star, but it was nothing special. The location is not that convenient. The rooms were cold (they were, I suspect, aiming at cool), lacked ambiance and were weirdly designed (I mean, I think my girlfriend is incredibly hot, but I have no wish to see her go to the loo through the glass wall to the bathroom -- any more than she does me). We stayed three days, and the sheets were not changed. But the staff were friendly and the lobby area is not without a certain sexy minimalism. Check out was a hassle given that they were not sure what they needed from us. I've stayed at the Savoy (owned by the same people as Ku'Damm 101 and about 10 mins walk away), and while supposedly stuffy, it is in fact more stylish by far -- and, while a little more expensive -- an awful lot more comfortable.

<Content>Great choice OK, it may not be the most luxurious of hotels however it is inexpensive and the difference is that it has some neat design touches. Its just a bit different. I will look this place up first next time I'm in Berlin. I can also highly recommend the Sakura Sushi place. Its about 10 mintues walk towards town on the same side of Ku' Damm as the hotel.
