<Content>Great hotel! We stayed at the Loew's Hotel for the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans this year (2009) and had a wonderful experience. The staff bent over backwards to ensure our happiness. The room was clean and our view was spectacular! I would certainly recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Great hotel location/amenities - housekeep issues Stayed here in mid October 2008 for 5 nights. Staff could not have been nicer. Great location and spacious rooms with very decent amenities. As others have written, housekeeping staff could use some instruction on to keep/make rooms cleaner. While there are plenty of hotels in NOLA, I would probably stay here again.

<Content>A great Hotel ... BUT ..... The housekeeping issues brought up by other reviewers need addressing. To be plain - the people who clean the room simply do not do it very well - they merely make the beds and change the towels. On several occasions dirty cups and glasses were left in the room, nothing was tidied, the coffee was not replenished and on several occasions on returning to the room at around 5pm after being out all day the room had STILL not been cleaned! On the positive side, I think that the staff are well used to complaints about housekeeping - I think the management do not have any intentions of insisting housekeeping staff improve as the latter are probably paid peanuts and it is clearly considered more cost effective to retain lazy staff and compensate guests who make a complaint! Hence we had free drinks, free meals, bathrobes to take home and a whole plethora of goodies! I would suggest that rather than putting up with the inconveniences of not having coffee replenished etc that guests do bring this to the management's attention. I think only when half the guests are having to have hundreds of dollars of credit at the bar and restaurant will the low standards of housekeeping be addressed on a more permanent basis. Other than this I agree with all the positive reviews, very comfy and spacious rooms and bathrooms especially in grand deluxe, great location and a wonderful if slightly overpriced restaurant with an atmospheric bar.

<Content>Great Spa Nice upscale hotel with only a few small issues.If your looking for a hotel with class and a top notch spa look no futher.The location is great,it's right across the street from Harrahs and about 5 or 6 blocks from the La. Superdome.Also about 3 blocks to the French Quarter.Don't forget to hit Dragos for it's charbroiled oysters,at The Hilton Riverside(2 blocks).The small issues were the hot tub had a bit of mold,the bed was a bit too firm,and the ac didn't seem to put out too good..But believe me the hotel was still top notch.

<Content>Loved this place! We stayed for two nights right after they opened the city after Hurricane Gustav. The Loews Hotel is exceptional. The facilities are nicely decorated, the lobby is beautiful and air conditioned. The hotel is also pet friendly and in a great location, close to RiverWalk and the French Quarter.The front desk staff are professional and very helpful.Our room was clean, nicely decorated and so comfortable. Great flat screen tv. The bed was firm and the pillows were great. The bathroom had both a tub and separate shower. It also had lots of room to move around.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great experience.

<Content>The Best Hotel Staff EVER We had tickets to see the Bucs play the Saints on Sunday, September 7th. We had airline tickets to fly Southwest on Thursday, September 4th and reservations for 4 nights at Harrah's (free rooms). Then Hurricane Gustav came up the Gulf and a mandatory evacuation was ordered for of all of New Orleans. On Tuesday night Harrah's called and said our reservations were cancelled and they didn't know when they would be ready to open. They were not at all helpful even though we were left with nowhere to stay.I contacted Loews and got a room for 4 nights. Our flight was one of the first ones to arrive in New Orleans after Hurricane Gustav passed. We arrived at Loews about 3 p.m. to a skeleton staff of employees who were either back in the city after the evacuation or had not left. There was still a curfew in effect and very little open the first couple of nights that we were there, but Loews more than made up for any inconvenience. They put out a great (and very reasonable priced) buffet on Thursday night with what they had available since there had not been any deliveries in a few days.It was the best experience we have ever had at a hotel! The restaurant manager, Daniel is a warm wonderful person could not have been more accomodating and efficient. Bartenders and wait staff Angela, Micheal, Michael, David, Lou, Talia are incredible. Nathan from the bell staff was terrific. By Friday we felt like part of the Loews family! We met people who lived locally and had no electricity when they returned home. We met family members of staff who were staying at Loews because they had no electricity at home. We had a great time (even though the Bucs did lose on Sunday). In spite of the adversities of hurricane evacuation the staff at this hotel were just amazing. What could have been a very miserable experience was turned into an outstanding trip for us. Thank you, thank you. You guys are the best! We will pay to stay at Loews the next time we come to New Orleans rather than stay at Harrah's. And, we will definitely be looking for Loews hotels when we travel.

<Content>Great Hotel Our weekend in New Orleans was made so much better by our decision to stay at the Loews Hotel. The staff was amazing, all the guys down in the lobby helped our group of 10 get unloaded and up to our rooms and then were equally helpful in getting us back in the cars for the trip home on Sunday. The restaurant has an excellent breakfast buffet that we enjoyed on Sunday morning.....just what we needed after two nights at Bourbon Street. The rooms were big and clean and the King bed was amazing......best ever. Our view of the river from the 19th floor was beautiful too. Room service at 2am was very prompt, very professional. I would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in New Orleans. The casino was right across the street, so was Mothers restaurant and Bourbon street was an easy walk. We'll be back.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! My SO and I stayed here two nights for free (comped by Harrah's); however, I won't let that affect my review. I would most definitely stay here again whether it was free or not. (We recently stayed at the nearby Hilton and it wasn't nearly as nice as this.)We were here on a weekend so we parked on the street for free, so I have no comment on the hotel's parking situation.The front desk staff was great and upgraded us to a nicer room on the executive floor. We had a fantastic view of the city and Mississippi River. This room was like the perfect hotel room: oversized, clean, modern and well-appointed. I loved the large entry area. It provides extra space for things and had a nice long table along the wall with a shelf underneath. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and had very comfy pillows too. There was a sitting area with couch and coffee table as well as a very large desk and chair. The TV, which sat on top of a hutch with drawers, swiveled so you could view it if you were in bed or sitting on the couch. However, unless you propped something behind the TV, it would swivel back around. (The hotel menu book came in handy for something. LOL!)The bathroom was average-size but stylish and had some nice toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body wash, sewing kit and q-tips, but no shower cap) and a high-wattage blow dryer. The towels were plentiful and plush and included two oversized bath sheets. Nice! Outside the bathroom was additional counter space on which was an Ipod port  speakers, and underneath that on pull-out shelves was a coffee maker  fixin's (Emeril's coffee, decaf, green tea and black tea), ice bucket and glasses. Across from that was an ample-sized closet with an iron and ironing board and a pair of robes.We don't know if anyone was staying next to us, but we never heard any noise. We enjoyed the New Orleans Picayne newspaper that was left outside our door each morning. We did not make use of the pool, workout room or restaurants so I have no comment on them. The downstairs lobby area was small but very elegant. I noticed they're pet-friendly as when we were leaving I noticed a couple checking in with 2 dogs. I suppose that can be either a positive or negative, depending on how you look at it.I thought the location was perfect: close enough to the French Quarter to walk there, but just far enough away to be quiet. Really perfect location for us. Across the street in one direction is Harrah's Casino and in another direction is Mother's Restaurant. (Mother's may not be what it once was, but you can't go wrong if you order what we did for an early dinner: Mother's famous ham poboys and for dessert, bread pudding!) My one little quibble with Loew's New Orleans would be that housekeeping forgot to replenish our coffee and we had to contact housekeeping twice to get it. Then it took them forever to bring it. Other than that, a perfect stay!

<Content>A very nice hotel Once again after doing my research on Tripadvisor, I settled on the Loews. I will describe the positive things first. The room was very spacious. I became a member of the Loews You First program before going on my trip and I was able to get a room upgrade and all the benefits associated with the program. I recommend you look into it. The front desk staff was professional and had an overall good attitude. The doormen and bellmen were the absolute best ever! Especially Doug, he is the nicest hotel employee we encountered. I will agree with the description of the bathroom in the previous review. The hotel is in a good neighborhood, but the streets are isolated late at night. I recommend Mother's restaurant across the street. It is a New Orleans establishment in every sense of the word. The experience in this hotel was good overall, except... The not so good. Our room was not cleaned at all on Saturday. The housekeeper eventually came at 8:00 p.m. Which was of course too late really.I have a bit of a problem with that, I guess it's b/c I'm a wife and mom and like to be a bit pampered on vacation. I did get the turn down service offered the first night. The other thing that I found is that the hotel is kind of far from the Quarter. It's within walking distance, but kind of far and like I said the streets are isolated at night.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay I stayed a the Loews for business for three nights. Booked a deluxe king room. Note - the hotel does not guarantee the type of bedding just the level of the room. When I checked in I was given the wrong level of room. It took two calls to get the room straight. The front desk was not helpful but the manager was very helpful and quick to fix the problem.The bed was very comfortable with many nice pillows. The deluxe bathroom had a large walk in shower with a separate tub. More than enough towels . The normal rooms have an average size bathroom - nothing special. The fitness center is small but adequate. There is a lap pool for exercise.The hotel is within walking distance of the riverwalk and the convention center. We walked to the French Quarter though I would not walk home after dark alone. The hotel is directly across the street from Harrah's for those who like gaming. Cabs were very easy to get at the hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Weekend! My boyfriend and I, both in our mid-twenties, stayed at Loews New Orleans for a lovely weekend away in early May. We found the accomodations to be very nice. The people were friendly and the room was nice. It wasn't over the top luxury but it was definitely above average. The bar down in the lobby is worth checking out and we had the breakfast buffet one day which was fantastic. New Oleans is a wonderful city! We liked that this hotel was a little bit away from the quarter (but still an easy walk!) since we were there for a romantic weekend. I had never stayed at a Loews before but I would definitely stay with them again based on my experience in NO. Bon voyage!

<Content>Disappointed I stayed at this hotel one night over Memorial Day Weekend 2008. I had high hopes based on other reviews but was disappointed in every respect.1. Valet was terrible. We stood there for about 5 minutes, in blazing heat, and were completely ignored. When I finally got one guy to stop for me we were almost immediately interrupted by another guest who was unhappy so the valet left me standing there to go console the other person. No apology. 2. Both my reservation and my friend's reservation were messed up. We reserved our rooms months apart so it was two separate instances. 3. The person who helped me at the front desk was very curt and unfriendly, and couldn't find my reservation as mentioned. When she did find it she told me, in an accusatory manner, that it was because they were expecting me the day before, and then completely ignored me when I explained that the mistake was on their end because I had cancelled that night a week before. 4. They put my friend immediately into his room while I had to wait for several hours. 5. I was told I would be called on my cell phone when my room was ready, never happened. 6. I was also told that the reason my room was delayed was because it was upgraded. It was not. It was smaller than my friend's room and had ugly black stains on the carpet. 7. I could hear EVERY WORD from the room next door. The only nice things I can say are that the bed was comfortable and the concierge the next morning was helpful.If I had been staying in New Orleans two nights, I would have gone to another hotel. Others in my party stayed at the Windsor Court Hotel just down the street and although I only saw the lobby, it was beautiful and elegant and highly recommended.This was my first visit to New Orleans and it's sad to me that my first impression was bad service and bad quality. Luckily the city itself was full of character and charm and was worth the visit.

<Content>Mixed Bag So, here are the positives and negatives.-Hotel is kinda far out from the French Quarter, but we are walkers so not a big issue-Hotel is sorely understaffed--operator and front desk took for forever to answer the phone, and when they did we were put on hold-NO NOISE ABATEMENT--could hear everything in other room (including a 6 a. m. o'clock alarm clock that went off, and no one was occupying the room to turn it off). Took 35 minutes by the clock for the front desk to send someone to turn it off.-Could hear everything in the hallway-nightstand phone and heater were inititally not working-front doormen ranged from helpful, not wanting to call us a cab, to somewhat helpful-after hours room service food was terrible, before 10 p.m., the food was good-painfully small bathrooms-Nice workout room but no elliptical trainer or television remotes or headphones-nice pool/jacuzzi-nice spa personnel-very good beds--was upgraded to suite, really a glorified bigger room with a much larger bathroom-concierge was helpful**Don't pay for wireless in your room--sit near the window and you can capture it for free; also, free in the lobby

<Content>Good but could do better. Overall, it was a positive experience staying here. It wasn't too expensive and you could tell they were trying. It was just a bit uneven in service and quality.The staff varied from being fantastically helpful to downright unpleasant. We arrived a day late due to flight problems but had phoned to confirm our arrival and to check that everything was okay. They of course assured us it was. When we got there, they had not record of our bookings etc. This meant that there were problems too on checking out even though we were there for 6 days and had brought up this matter already.Restaurant was okay: at breakfast and lunch (we had a business lunch there) the waiters were excellent but the food at lunch wasn't good at all. I would avoid eating at the restaurant unless you had no options. The bar was fine. The breakfast buffet was variable and the a la carte seemed better.The hotel had a nice gym which had good opening hours. The pool looked small but I didn't use it.Rooms were very well done and my bathroom was fantastic. I would stay again but I imagine there are better hotels similarly priced that would be worth a try. I'm rating it above average but that's because the rooms were very nice with good views etc.

<Content>loved loews I have been to New Orleans many times and have never before stayed at Loews...I have been missing a great hotel. It did have some issues, but the staff tries to help. Our check in was delayed as the room was not ready and it was after 5 pm...they upgraded us and gave us complimentary drinks. Our room was great, the bathroom and beds superior.. what we really enjoyed was the ambiance of the lobby...it was really comfortable to sit and read or have a drink without feeling rushed. After walking all day it was a real treat. They have great coffee in the am and supply a paper too. We normally stay at Harrahs...but at Harrahs there is no place other than the casino to get coffee and it certainly does not feel cozy to sit...obviously, their focus is on getting you into the casino and not staying in the hotel. I hope you all enjoy your stay as much as we enjoyed ours

<Content>A "nice" business hotel near the French Quarter Went to New Orleans for a business trip, accompanied by wife. She is also helping me to write this review. Trip was arranged via travel agent. Check in was smooth, small lobby, doorman and check in were very efficient. Got to room, nice large room with room for sofa, desk, king sized bed. Very clean and well appointed. Small hall area and small storage area on way to bath room help to qualify room as a suite. Our suite on the 17th floor had a view of the Mississippi River. Hotel is adjacent to Harrah's Casino and about 5 blocks to the heart of the French Quarter. The restaurant in the hotel is another of the Brennan family of restaurants.This is a small, vertical hotel, everything with my meeting occurred on floors 8-10. Thank goodness the elevators move very fast given the amount of traffic. Meeting rooms were very nice, well appointed and food was very good, even satisfied my foodie wife. Staff was very helpful with suggestions for places to go and how to get there.While I was in meeting, wife used the gym--although small, had windows, TV and the usual gym equipment. Spa on site with lap pool, neither of us used it. Free coffee in lobby and you get free newspaper each morning. Internet in rooms is wired and has a use fee, anything printed requires trip to business center. Bar was very popular.Negatives--turndown service--you have to call for it. If you wanted any little items like magazines, there is no little shop in the hotel, kind of surprising for a hotel. I don't think that I have ever been in a hotel without a sundry-souvenir shop. Bathroom amenities were not as plentiful or as nice as other hotels in this class. My wife noticed the lack of a shower cap and lack of hair dryer in room, although I thought if you really needed it, they would probably provide you with one. Also if you wanted boarding passes printed, you need to go to the one and only concierge--who was getting slammed Saturday afternoon after our meeting, as everyone was waiting to get their boarding pass at the same time. We all felt sorry for her, she suggested that we write a comment to the management about this situation. Same thing happened with bell captain when we wanted to get our bags to leave--kind of overwhelmed with the rush.Overall a pleasant, but not totally satisfying experience. As far as I was concerned as a hotel for a meeting, it was very good. But if you are staying for fun and games, the location is very good, staff is good, but has a few quirks that make it just above average and not excellent.

EXCELLENT service, truly exceptional  wonderful staff, absolutely gorgeous and spacious suite, great restaurant, fun bar/lounge... The location is superb and there are fabulous restaurants within easy walking distance. You are within a few blocks of the French Quarter, and some nice shopping is in a small mall a block away. GREAT location!!We would not hesitate to recommend this lovely hotel to anyone wanting a nice, quiet and beautiful hotel. I read about someone's issues, and our experience was that any request large or small was handled immediately and graciously. Southern hospitality at its finest!!

<Content>Loved everything!!!! I stayed at the Loews Hotel this weekend because of the NBA All star events and I must say that this hotel experience was amazing. From checking in to the day I checked-out I felt like I was having a VIP experience. I work at the Ritz-Carlton back home and I was pretty skeptical about how my experience would be at the Loews since I have stayed at several Ritz-Carlton's before. My experience was great and most importantly the doormen were most helpful especially one gentleman named.....Carl.....everyone else was just as helpful but this gentleman stood out among the others...good job Loews!!!

<Content>Great! I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I stayed here for a conference, and though my flight arrived at 9 AM, they let me check in that morning with no hassle. The concierge was genuinely helpful and friendly, which was a welcomed change. The room I stayed in was WONDERFUL. It was bigger than my studio apartment and had two tvs, a couch, a king-sized bed, and a great view. The staff were always friendly. As to the location--the best. You are so close to the French Quarter (and its a safe walk), you are pretty much next to the Algiers Ferry, Harrah's Casino is across the street, and Mardi Gras parades listed in uptown concluded their route right near the hotel (some nights in front of the hotel, literally). The only disappointment I had with the hotel were the beds-nice linens, huge, but not very comfortable. Also, the walls were so thin I would frequently be woken up by people closing doors, etc. The only other thing I didn't like is that I ordered room service (and a VERY simple meal, at that), and it wasn't very tasty and was over-priced...even for room service. But, I would go back in a heartbeat. Their conference and meeting facilities are amazing, as well.

<Content>simply the best! My husband  I stayed here for five days over Christmas-a choice we made two days before leaving for New Orleans, booking direct and receiving an incredible room rate. What a Christmas present! The staff was knowledgeable and never hesitated to help us whether it was their job or not. The room was big and very clean, everything worked! Loved the bathroom and bed. Can't say enough about the dining room; dinners were gourmet as well as breakfast. Service was exceptional thoughout the hotel. The ladies at the conceirge desk were so very helpful and always pleasant. When leaving we decided to FedEx our luggage home. The conceirge supplied us with the paperwork. While waiting in the lobby for airport transportation I noticed the bellman securing our luggage with mailing tape, ensuring that even with a broken zipper our luggage would stay intact! I found this to be unbelievable service. We will always book a Loew's and can hardly wait to return to this one!

<Content>Great pick - walking distance from French Quarter This brand new hotel was located 5 to 10 minutes walking distance from the French Quarter, and from the St-Charles streetcar line, which goes to the Garden DIstrict (a must do, and a great value $1.25 each way). Also located next door to the Harrah's Hotel and Casino.The rooms are big, so are the bathrooms. Separate large shower and tub. Nice window/lighting in the bathroom. A personal safe was in our room, as were comfy bathrobes. Internet (wired) access was free (at least with our room).Service at the hotel was very attentive, concierge was very personable and recommended several restaurants within walking distance. Only complaint is they did not make up our room on one occasion, before we got back around 5 PM. A quick call took care of that, and the room was clean by the time we got back after dinner.At $189 per nite, not the best bargain in town, but great location and brand new, so a good value.

<Content>nice hotel with a fantastic bar and restaurant the lobby, staff and rooms are all very nice, but the reason I'll come back here is the Swizzle Stick bar!!! A classy place for exceptional cocktails, and resident mixologist Michael and his sidekick Mike were super friendly. Their specialty cocktails are amazing, and you might consider staying for dinner at the bar; the lobster bisque and shrimp corndogs were brilliant! I went back to the restaurant, cafe Adelaide, for a very special lunch, and the service and presentation were as top-notch as the food.

<Content>I still think about this place! It has been almost 3 years since my stay but I still think about this hotel and whenever I travel to a new city I check to see if there is a Loews to stay at because of it. I can't report on what it's like now, but I really loved this hotel. It was elegant and I loved the design. It felt posh but not so much so that it was uncomfortable. The light colors in the room were very relaxing, the down comforters and pillows, great sheets and marble bathroom also memorable. We got a steal on this place through expedia - around $100-$125 a night and it was definatley worth it. It's in a nice area within walking distance of the French Quarter area. Room service was a little pricey but that's the story for all hotels. The bar area was classy as well -had a nice martini. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Love the Loews I love the LOEWS hotels. The lobbies, the rooms, and the staff are always extremely accomodating and helfpul. When I travel this is the first chain that I search for. I was sorry to see that they closed their Chicago location.With regards to the New Orleans location, it is directly across the street from the Harrahs casino (making it easy to come home after gambling!). It is also within a 3 minute walking distance to a new shopping center with a Saks Fifth Avenue and a movie theater. My husband and I managed to watch an independent film during our stay at the movie theater and were very happy to do so.The hotel had lemonade available upon checkin and the staff kindly assisted us to our rooms. We were given a nice corner room with so much space and a very nicely equipped bathroom. The beds at the Loews hotels are wonderful. There were 2 tvs in our room, one in front of the bed, and one in a sitting area.My husband and I ate at Adelaide's restaurant (in the hotel) and loved the food. EXCELLENT food and truly amazing service. All of our courses were served at the same time, literally. There were 3 of us at dinner and when the plates were set on the table, there were 3 people setting them down so they arrived at the exact same time. We were all really happy with the butternut squash soup, I ordered the beef and my husband ordered the lamb. Each dish was fantastic.As usual and as expected, the entire Loews experience was TOP NOTCH.

<Content>Nice place--needs more help I was in New Orleans on business for 5 days and stayed at Loews. I had a king corner room--very large with excellent amenities. They do still seem to have an employee shortage--no doorman on duty some of the mornings to get me a cab and 2 of the 5 days I didn't think the room was cleaned very well. One odd thing is that they always seemed to want to turn down the bed (a nice touch few hotels still do)--but at 6pm which usually wasn't convenient.. Housekeeping staff also seemed to have extremely limited English which caused a few minor problems. Room service was good and quick--very important!--but the dinner menu needs more variety--especially since there's a great restaurant in the hotel. Lunch time martinis for 25 cents was a nice touch. Hotel staff were all very courteous and had a good attittude even when overwhelmed some mornings. I would rate the hotel above average to excellent and would definitely return.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Great Service We stayed at the Loews for the weekend to attend a wedding in New Orleans and we were pleasantly surprised at how nice the hotel was. It was very conveniently located with most French Quarter, Riverwalk, Harrah's Casino and Canal Place Shops all within comfortable walking distance. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very nice. We stayed on the 19th floor King Corner Suite which faced the Harrah's hotel, but had river views to either side of it. The bathroom was very luxurious, much better than the marriotts and sheratons where we usually stay. Nightly turndown service and high speed internet access was a plus. All in all we were very impressed with the property and would highly recommend it.

The room was clean, the bathroom gorgeous and the linens fantastic. View from the 16th floor to the river - amazing and this hotel is one block from the French Quarter. (Note: wear comfy shoes and be prepared to walk in this city!)ESPECIALLY nice: The front desk manager heard me mention that this was a weekend trip prior to my husband deploying for Iraq and sent us complimentary wine/strawberries the last night of our stay - I was really touched and hope the GM got the note of praise I left for this employee!Downside: hidden parking charges per night. Didn't expect those. And be prepared to tip...keep the ones and fives on you!All in all, if you can afford the place, stay there. (PS - there are some great deals going on this summer!)

<Content>Loews New Orleans found my cell phone-great service! I stayed one night at the Loews and was not disappointed. I didn't realize that my daughter had left her cell phone in the room until we arrived home nine hours later. Upon arriving home, we found that someone from the Loews security staff had already contacted us. The phone was shipped to me within 48 hours! What service!The hotel was beautiful, great location and great staff. Everyone was very accommodating and professional. After calling the front desk to explain that I didn't understand how to adjust the thermostat in my room, a maintenance man showed up within minutes! The valet parking had in-out privileges and my car was always brought up to the front timely. While having a night cap in the bar, we were given complimentary desserts. Although the treats were left over from the days business in the restaurant, they still fresh and very yummy! What a nice gesture.This is my second experience with Loews and I can't say enough about how pleased I was with everything. My other stay was at the Loews Miami on South Beach several years ago....what a gem! Same great service and what a location....right on the beach!

<Content>WOW. Loved the Loews! Stayed four nights for a conference in July. Truly everything about this hotel was first-class -- it was one of my best hotel stays in 20+ years of travel. The Loews New Orleans is very stylish and to a person everyone there was friendly and helpful. The check-in was smooth (even with my discounted Travelocity room rate of $104), and with my high floor request I received the top floor of the hotel. In four days I rode express to the 21st floor on the elevators with no stops or waiting most of the trips. My room was large, clean, comfortable, quiet, and very well air-conditioned. There was a great view of the river, bridge, and city. The bed was superb. In my closet I found an umbrella to use during my stay. It was much bigger than the one I brought so I ended up using it most days. The elegant bathroom had granite (?) countertops and enough towels for four people. Every day my room was cleaned beautifully. The housekeeping staff were polite when knocking, and understanding when asked to come back. One day they even left a small fabric mat under my toothbrush. In a rush, I'd forgotten my toothpaste and sheepishly asked for help at the desk -- and promptly received a small tube, no charge. The concierge(s) helped me find a shoe repair shop and checked diligently for an open seat on the airport shuttle bus. Finally, the doormen at the Loews New Orleans were simply the best -- even while working in the extreme heat or rain. I watched one doorman get soaked in rainstorm as he held his umbrella over a guest as she made her way from the cab to the door. Another doorman helped me understand the best/driest walking routes to the convention center. The only small mistake made during my entire stay was fixed promptly and with an apology (an incorrect room charge). The location works well for a conference in the convention center (about 3-4 blocks) yet it is still close to the French Quarter (about 6-8 blocks). The pool and gym looked great but I didn't use them. Also did not use parking or the restaurant. The entire staff at the Loews is very service-oriented, friendly, and polite. They made it clear that New Orleans is indeed open for business. I will stay at this Loews again, for sure, on our next trip.

<Content>Great for Business or Pleasure I was traveling to New Orleans for a convention, and my trade association did not offer any good choices for lodgings. I did my own research and found a great summer rate at the Loews. My room was huge and immaculate (I had a king luxury room with a sofa, armchair, and spacious desk area). The staff was helpful, and the food at Cafe Adelaide was far, far above the usual hotel fare. If you go for breakfast, be sure to sample the grits! You absolutely have to have some cocktails at the Swizzle Stick Bar -- the bartenders are attentive, and they really know their stuff. The hotel is about a 15-minute walk from the Quarter. As a woman traveling alone, I felt totally comfortable walking back to the hotel from the Quarter after sunset. If you're attending events at the Convention Center, the Loews is about a 10-minute walk from the Center. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Bon temps in Loews I stayed at the Loews Hotel New Orleans for a conference in July 2007. It was not one of the conference hotels, but from what I hear from fellow conference attendees, I think it was the best deal in town. The rooms were a good size (the bed and pillows were so comfortable!), the bathrooms were modern and well-appointed, 2 bathrobes were provided, nice fitness area and lap pool (2 lanes), plus a wonderful lounge space on the main lobby floor. The staff was attentive and helpful. The hotel is 2 blocks from Harrah's Casino and a short walk to the French Quarter. The Hilton is 2 blocks away (many of our conference events were held there) and the convention center is about 5-6 blocks away. Mother's, a popular breakfast establishment, is 1 block away. Emeril's restaurant (where we had a completely fabulous meal) is about 3-4 blocks away on Tchoupitoulas.The lovely modern lounge area provides a relaxing space. Wifi is free throughout the ground floor lobby area, but $12.95 in the rooms (seems excessive). Staff were exceedingly pleasant and helpful. I loved the bath products provided. For those traveling with pets, the hotel is pet-friendly. I shared an elevator with 2 chihuahuas.I paid the gov't rate of $102/night + taxes, which came to about $118/night. At the time, they were offering a buy 3 nights, get the 4th free rate that was comparable. Friends booked into suites on the 18th floor that were not much more expensive and offered additional space.I wish I had discovered the lever that adjusted the water pressure earlier on - I took a few very low-pressure showers before I noticed it adjusted. The housekeeping staff removed the bar soap each day and replaced with fresh soap, which seemed a bit unnecessary to me and a giant waste of soap.In the bar, the Bloody Marys weren't very good (too much spice and too many extraneous vegetables - string beans?!?), but the waiter apologized and offered to remove the drinks from the receipt. He was very attentive to our needs and conveyed how much the staff love working at the Loews. It definitely shows.I will look for a Loews again in my future travels.PS As a side note, for those who may be hesitant of visiting New Orleans post-Katrina, the convention center area and the French Quarter area were not as affected and don't really appear any different to the average tourist. Further out, there is still significant damage. We took a brief tour of the Lower 9th Ward that was sobering. That said, the local people are SO HAPPY to have visitors in their city and thrilled to welcome you. Everyone - the cab drivers, the shop owners, the bartenders, etc. - will tell you how happy they are to see you and thank you profusely for keeping their city alive. It's definitely worth a visit. If you do, check out the wonderful NOLA Habitat for Humanity. They are doing fantastic work, particularly at Musicians' Village [--]

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Not Far from the Main Area I stayed at the Loews while I was in town at a conference and I was really happy that I did. I was originally going to stay at the Hilton next door where the conference was held, but it seemed really old and outdated so I chose the Loews. My coworker was completely jealous when she came over to the lobby of the Loews to meet me one night! I stayed in a luxury suite for only $125 a night and it was well worth it, huge bed, very clean and the staff very helpful. I also ate breakfast two mornings at the Adelaide, Swizzle Stick Bar and Cafe downstairs in the lobby and it was fantastic! I wish I had discovered the Cafe earlier in the week because I surely would have gone each morning for breakfast. I also used the gym which was nice and a small indoor pool. It is right next door to the Casino and the W hotel which has a nice bar in it. It is a short walk from Canal Street and the upscale store areas, and then you're in the French Quarter. For places to eat, try Mother's across the street from the hotel, if you're adventurous and feel like biscuits, ham and grits - true N'Awlins cooking. I also had very good lunches, not expensive at the cute little La Boucherie Coffee House on Chartres street , and the Red Fish Grille closer to Bourbon. New Orleans is very much a walkable city so nothing seemed too far a part. I would definitely stay at the Loews again without a doubt!

<Content>Highly recommended for business and pleasure Stayed here in May for a convention. I love the intimate, well appointed lobby as it's easy to find colleagues at a glance.Breakfast buffet very reasonable and delicious although a great joint down the street called Mother's serves New Orleans style meals tooConcierge very polite and helpful as I was always in need of directions.large, clean fitness center and poolroom was very large and seemed brand new - had a nice view of the riverA bit of a walk to Bourbon Street but not too bad - took a (cheap) cab a few times and hotel is next door to Harrah'sI was worried about being in New Orleans and left all of my jewelry at home. I felt very safe and never threatened although friends who went for long jogs got an eerie feeling of emptiness once out of the French quarterDefinitely get out of the French quarter so you can see the remains of the devastation of Katrina. So many homes are vacant and not repaired. I took a cab tour of the 9th ward and recommend this. The Lowe's door man ordered a special cab for this. There were three of us and it was about $170 for a quick one hour tour and return trip to the airport. I thought this was very expensive but then again felt okay making the contribution to the local economy. Our guide was very thorough and a local.Bourbon Street was alive - but then again there were 20,000 conventioneers there. Not sure what it's like on an off-night but would recommend going if it's in your plans.

The decor of the room was first class, and the bed was VERY comfortable. The location is ideal for french quarter fun, and the area feels very safe at night. We did not care for the $30.00 a day valet parking fee, but parking is always expensive in New Orleans anyway. We found a $12.00 a day parking lot next door to the hotel, and used it for the last two days of our stay. The hotel is VERY pet friendly, which is a big plus in our book!!

<Content>Nice place This is my 2nd trip to N.O. I booked a BB and a hotel for work due to limited availability during the week of Mar 25th. My travel agent booked Loews hotel in the Business District at $244/nt.This is a very nice hotel and they do have a doorman. You must valet park and it is ~$30/day. The French Quarters is 4 blocks away and the Harrahs casino is nearby. My room was nice - modern decoration and spacious with 2 TVs, one for the 'lounge' area and one directly in front of the bed.The concierge recommended a southern type restaurant across the street. It is overrated and pricey - I think it has become a 'tourist trap' type restaurant.

<Content>How a Restaurant can destroy a great hotel I recently stayed at the Loews New Orleans hotel. Overall, it was excellent--except the restaurant for breakfast is so miserable that given that there are several wonderful hotels within one block of Loews, you might as well stay at one of them ( the W hotel, Harrahs Hotel, or the Hilton). Let me explain. When one goes to New Orleans, one usually parties until late in the evening/morning. The restaurant stops serving their miserable breakfast buffet at 10AM! (10:30 on weekends.) COME ON. This is NEW ORLEANS. If you make it down for breakfast--hold on. You will be advised that the only option you have is the buffet. Cold, steely-hard eggs--and a poorly kept table that runs low on food and is not particularly appetizing. You will not be allowed to order off of a menu. So, the first morning you choke down the food--only to swear never to return. The following mornings, you cross the street and have a fantastic menu-ordered breakfast at the aforementioned hotels. And you think to yourself, why didn't I stay here? In New Orleans, about the only meal you want to eat at the hotel--given the amazing choices of restaurants--is breakfast. So, if the hotel you are staying at has early breakfast hours and only provides a wretched buffet at that, you might as well stay elsewhere. It is truly a shame because, otherwise, the staff is nice (other than the buffet matrons in the restaurant), the rooms are great, the gym is one of the best I have seen in a hotel, and the cleaning staff is very responsive to your needs. So, an otherwise great hotel is ruined by a poor restaurant and the fact that there are 3 great hotels next door that win out in the competition.

Gym and pool are truly exceptional (except for the lack of an elliptical trainer). But a lovely small lap pool and sauna, exercise balls, free weights and good exercise space made up for it. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>not the same hotel as before...... I recently took my family to a quick weekend trip in New Orleans. We have stayed at the Loews in times past and the hotel has always exceeded our expectations. This stay differed completely from our past stays. The rooms are not as clean as you would expect from a hotel of this quality. The noise from the club next door was so bad we had to change rooms. The overall condition of the second room was the same as the first. The staff was friendly but not professional. My conclusion is that good staff is hard to come by in post Katrina New Orleans. I would recommend the Winsor Court to any visitor in the future who expects a first rate stay. I rate the Loews a little above the Holiday Inn. Our first stay at the hotel several years ago was one of my best overall experiences of any hotel in New Orleans. The staff was very professional and attended to our every need. They even had gift bags for my young children. The gift bags made the hotel my children鈥檚 favorite and they insisted we stay at the hotel that has the cool ducks toys in the blue bag. After my last experience, I doubt I will stay at the Loews again.

<Content>Great rooms and service Loews New Orleans has great value for their prices. The rooms are large and spacious and the staff is ultra friendly.. My wife stayed the night before our wedding in December of 2006 and we stayed the night of the wedding. The rooms are large enough for several people to get dressed in at once. The bathrooms are also very big. The Loews is right across the street from Harrah's New Orleans Casino and just blocks from the French Quarter and Burbon Street. Be prepared to pay for parking- it is around $30 a night. (Most hotels in this area require you to pay for valet parking). Other than that, excellent stay.

<Content>Outstanding service, location and FOOD! I was recently in New Orleans for a convention and I selected the Loews as my home away from home. Upon arrival to the hotel, I was greeted warmly by the doorman (there was ALWAYS a doorman there too...no other hotel I visited had that!) and was escorted to the front desk. The agent checking me in was also warm and seemed very happy to be of service. The room was large, bright and comfortable. I had high ceilings which added to the spacious feel of the room. The bed was great, the room was clean and contemporary...and very comfortable. The one thing that struck me over my stay at the Loews was how friendly EVERY staff member was. From the room service staff to the front desk and even the bar. Oh, and speaking of the bar...they had a nightly drink special which was $2. Show me another hotel that sells you anything for $2...let alone something with alcohol in it! I've stayed at many places around the country and can honestly say that this stay ranks as one of my best hotel experiences. The service was superior to that at some of the Four Seasons and the like. If you are looking for a hotel in New Orleans...you can't go wrong with the Loews. The location is great...walking distance to the French Quarter and close to Riverwalk and the Convention Center.Thank you Loews for a great stay! I'll be back!

<Content>LUXURY hotel for Pet Owners It was our very first trip to New Orleans but we had our dog  cat with us. What a joy to encounter the Loews New Orleans and their wonderful southern hospitality. We booked the hotel the night before our arrival on December 17, 2006 and were told that pets are very welcome with us. Everyone, from the front bellmen, valet parkers, front desk and housekeeping were friendly and helpful- and NICE to our pets. Our dog even had the hotel's front door opened to him by the bellman as he entered and exited the hotel. Only drawback is limited walking areas for more active dogs (as ours is). But, we loved Loews so much that we could overlook that. Also, when we entered our spacious, clean and BEAUTIFUL room, we were pleased to see dog bowls, a dog place mat, dog treats and a letter from the hotel manager's pet pooch for us. What a nice touch! Also, if you join their frequent hotel stayer plan (which is easy and free), valet parking is complimentary and you are given a gift on arrival, such as wine or a fruit basket. The Loews chain has made a fan for life, we even changed our across the country drive itinerary so that we could stop in Tucson to stay at the Loews there. Have to say the NO Loews is a touch better than the Tucson Loews. But, we were so happy with the NO Loews we are still singing their praises to all of our friends who have pets as well as those who do not.

<Content>Fabulous hotel! We just returned from a weekend stay at the Loews hotel in New Orleans. It is a wonderful hotel. From the time we drove up until we left,we experienced top notch service. The staff is so courteous-more so than many hotels we've frequented.  Because we're Loews gold members,we were upgraded to a Grand Deluxe room. Our views of the Mississippi River were outstanding. The room was very spacious. The bathroom wasnicest we've ever seen in a hotel. We were tired(our daughter was in an all day cheer competition) so we decided to order room service. The hotel restaurant,Cafe Adelaide,is owned by the Brennan family-Commander's Palace,Mr. Bs,etc. The food was everything one would expect from a Brennan's owned restaurant-superb!Our server was very sweet. We walked to the French Quarter-about 1/2 mile away. It was a delightful walk. If going to the Big Easy, I heartily recommend this hotel. You won't regret this choice.

<Content>Terrific Loew's New Orleans We stayed at the Loew's for the weekend and loved it. The room was beautiful, large and quiet, with a great view of the Mississippi River. You could walk to the Superdome, French Quarter, RiverWalk and it was across the street from Harrah's Casino. The lobby bar was lovely with a very talented couple quietly entertaining by playing and singing old standards. We did not eat at the restaurant, Adelaide, but our friends said the food was delicious. The staff makes the hotel. They are friendly and welcoming. We're hoping to go back soon.

<Content>Nice hotel and great staff Stayed 4 nights to attend a convention.Plus:1. Efficient check-in and check-out2. Clean spacious room (larger than the room I had at the W just across the street)3. Separate shower and bath with very strong water pressure4. Nice location; within walking distance to the convention center, Harrah's casino, and the French Quarters5. Extremely nice staff and prompt serviceMinus:1. As a Loews First member, was told on check-in that my complimentary fruit and water would be delivered the next day; they were never delivered2. Received a bill after my first night for items from the in-room snack bar which I never used; called right away and was told it would be cancelled; upon check-out the charge was still there but was quickly removedOverall, I was pleased with my stay. The staff was pleasant and helpful. As you can see from above the execution could have been better. Otherwise the Loews would have gotten my highest recommendations.

<Content>Loews First is a must I discovered The Loews chain last December when we stayed in the Miami Beach location. A month later we had a stay at the San Diego location. Both were great expericees but did not compare to the level of service at the New Orleans location. Keep in mind I signed up for the Loews First program before our Miami stay so I am now at the Gold Level and let me tell you it is worth it.The staff here is very courteous the hotel is extrememly clean and the location is wonderful. The spa is the only thing that I was disappointed in but it is by no means a bad spa.Try this place you will like it.Loews first is a must with each stay my service gets better and better.joeCleveland, Ohio

<Content>Fantastic bar/lounge - check it out!!! we discovered Adelaide's at the Loew's Hotel through a fantastic LA blog (www.gumbopages.com.) We wandered in around 5PM the Saturday before Mardi Gras - Endemyon parade had been cancelled, it was raining like hell, winds blowing. The bar was the perfect place to sit out the storm. Friendly people all around including many in costumes from earlier parades. Service understandibly a bit slow but pleasant and warm. After waiting a few minutes, we were able to grab a table near a window where we sat for hours, eating delicious bar food, drinking dirty martinis and watching the wind and rain and our fellow bar patrons have a very good time. Bar food was delicious, we had several rounds of great snacks and drinks. No rush, no attitude, friendly people all around. Great place to hang out, we'll be back for drinks and dinner.

<Content>Wonderful spot for Mardi Gras This was my first stay back in New Orleans since Katrina and I was very apprehensive about it, but staying at Lowe's couldn't have been better. The staff and service were wonderful. The room was extremely clean and spacious. I ordered room service twice and the food was really good. We were there during Mardi Gras and it was a perfect location to the parades that we wanted to see. I'll definitly be back.

<Content>Loved the Loews New Orleans We just returned from a three-night stay at the Loews New Orleans hotel. We had a grand luxury king room and it was wonderful -- new, clean, spacious, and a wonderful, cozy bed made up with crisp white linens and a down duvet. The bathroom was large with a tub and separate walk-in shower. Our room was turned down every night, with bathrobes laid out and chocolates placed on the nightstand.The lobby of the hotel is also beautiful. There's a wonderful tile mosaic of New Orleans behind the front desk and the furnishings are beautiful throughout. We didn't eat at Cafe Adelaide, but the menu looked great.New Orleans is still a wonderful place to visit and they need our support. Please don't hesitate to come here and experience the unique culture that is New Orleans!

<Content>Lowes is Great With a little trepedation about returning to N.O. in mid January, my friend and I drove from Houston to the Lowes. Valet service was nice and patient; front desk couldn't find my reservation and I was forced to prove that I had one. I went to the 8th floor business center to print out the reservation from the Hotwire website and went back down to present it to the front desk clerk. He punched in the number and then exclaimed, Oh! The computer had your last name as your first, and your first as your last. That's why we couldn't find it. Well duh... I thought that's a basic duty of a front desk clerk to check on such things! Anyways it was an anoyance and a little bit discomforting. But maybe I should have told him to check!Overall the property is quite nice. Lobby and dining area,cocktail lounge are done in nice mature beiges with furnishings to match. Not too garish and not to frilly, but just right. Mature and sophisticated. Rooms are huge as are the bathrooms. All marble tubs and separate glass-enclosed shower with thick towels and nice bath robes. Beds are a joy. Fresh linen, and comforters to match. Staff were quite professional and nice. Absolutely no bad attitudes. We stayed on the 18th floor.The workout facilities and the lap pool and jacuzzi on the 8th floor are worth it. I had room service, and note to others: you must complete the door menu for breakfast on the weekends BEFORE 10AM or else you'll be forced to order from the lunch menu. A little bit of an unpleasant surprise if you enjoy lounging late in bed on a beautiful Sunday. My guess it's because of the lack of available workers due to Katrina.Overall I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful Experience! Stayed here just 3 days before Hurricane! I visited N.O. for the 1st time just days before the Hurricane hit. I stayed at the Loews and had an amazing room and exceptional service! Highly recommed staying in the Lux. King Suite. WOW.... A little pricely but WELL worth it....Everyone was so helpful and friendly. Definatley made some GREAT memories while I was there, and to watch the Hurricane come in just days after I was there was so heartbreaking. Was very lucky to have experienced N.O. then, cause it will not be the same for a LONG time if ever.Thanks again to the staff for a very memorable time! Look forward to coming back as soon as things open back up.

<Content>Comfortable stay in Crescent City. My wife and I stayed at this hotel from August 7th through the 11th of 2005. The hotel is well located, specially if attending a convention (Morial center is about 5 blocks away, easily walked) but equally convenient to the french quarter and streetcar lines to the garden district. The hotel is pretty drab from the exterior, but doesn't disappoint once you step inside. It has a very nice lobby with beautiful stained glass panels, and the adjacent Swizzle Stick bar is comfortable, cozy and hip. Our room had a nice view, the decoration was ok, but nothing extraordinary. The room was generally well-equipped with 2 phone lines and 2 phones (one cordless), coffee maker, hair dryer, high speed DSL (at no addtional cost) and a big desk and reading chair. The mattress, pillows and linens were great, along with the toiletries. The hotel has a small but relaxing indoor pool and a well-equipped gym. The concierge was very helpful in providing tourist info, maps and the sort. Overall service was above average. Considering the rate I paid (around $130 per night with taxes included) I don't think we could've done better. The only thing that wasn't satisfactory was the cost of valet service which at $28 per day seems excessive. Definitely recommended.

<Content>Good lodging accomodations, subpar service The hotel's accomodations were very good. The beds were very comfortable and the room was nicely decorated. However, for the level of hotel that it is, the service left much to be desired. The bartender was rude and neither the manager nor the concierge responded with anything above an apology. We had reservations three weeks in advance but our room category was unavailable at check-in. They upgraded us, but failed to communicate this with us and we had to call down to find out that we had been upgraded. We did not receive our Loews First welcome amenity. While my accommodations were nice, I feel what sets hotels of this class apart is service. So if service is what you crave, try the Ritz or the Sheraton instead.

<Content>Disappointed The Loews of New Orleans certainly misrepresented itself to me. I booked two rooms at the top rate. I made sure to join the Loews First club in advance of this costly stay. I anticipated earning points towards another stay within their chain,or with one of their business partners. However, here I am several months later, ready to collect and I am told- no deal! They did not credit either of our rooms and all the expensive food we ate, due to the fact that we booked our stay through the convention tourist agency! What a rip off!! None of this information was offered to me when I set up the membership! No other chain has such a policy!As for the hotel-the location is good but the hotel it is average in every way.There is no shortage of hotels to choose from in The Big Easy. As always - New Orleans as a city does not disappoint!

<Content>Best hotel stay ever We stayed in Loew's New Orleans July 17-18, 2005. To began, we were greeted by the most friendliest valet drivers. After giving them our keys the doorman was there to open the door for us. When approaching the service desk, the guest service representatives were on it. What I liked the most about the overall experience the workers all addressed us as Mr. and Mrs ......... We needed to know some information about the area and the lady at the concierge station was very knowledgeable about what she was telling us. What I was interested in the most was safety(what's the best place to go). My stay was a good one.

<Content>The "Loew" Down on Loews I stayed at Loews from June 30th-July 5th. The hotel is very clean and the staff were very friendly. The beds were very comfortable. The hotel is located directly across from Harrahs (casino) and within walking distance of many attractions. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again myself. The bar does close very early and the room service menu for late night is a bit limited. Please be aware that even if you request a non-smoking room it is a request and not guaranteed. However, the staff did come and spray the room and it did take out the smoke smell. The hotel is nice, clean and in a good location but the rate we paid (211 per night) is a bit high. Overall, I was impressed and satisfied with my stay. When in New Orleans check out Loews!

<Content>The Most Comfortable bed in the World We spent four nights here. Great view of the Mississippi. lovely large room. Ive never slept in a more comfortable bed. Incredible!! Great location a fiver taxi ride from the French Quarter. Next to Harrahs casino. Tea and coffee in the room (other American hotels can learn a lot from this) Check in was lengthy.Seemed like he had never had a guest before. Cashing a travellers cheque was an arduous experience and they forgot to send up our luggage. Had to phone down after three hours. Yet we still loved it!! Paul in the bar (from Scotland) is a star. Really friendly and gave us loads of tips. Would recommend Louisiana Tours. Absolutely superb. Hotel is in a nice safe area woth plenty of local bars. Really enjoyed staying here

<Content>I had a great experience I spent four nights at the Loews at the beginning of April. I had some issues prior to my arrival because of the rate (I had trouble getting the conference rate at the last minute) but that was resolved by a very friendly manager, who even upgraded my room to an executive suite.My Loews First gift was not there on my arrival, but it did not matter since I arrived rather late. The next day, when I made my request, they thought they may be out of cookies, so they asked if I wanted to wait until the next day or choose something else. However, they brought both gifts that same day.The bed was very comfortable and I had a nice view from my room.One negative-- Loews first members should get late checkout automatically. Mine was extended by only an hour, and only after I checked out did I notice that I should have been allowed a 3 PM checkout.Overall, I was very happy with Loews and I would consider staying at more of their properties.

<Content>Great location, Nice hotel, OK service The location is great. Not in the hubbub of the French Quarter, but a quick and safe walk in. The rooms are nice. Nothing spectacular, but pretty and the beds are quite comfortable. The staff is clueless and the Loews benefits are not well understood. We did not receive our Loews first welcome gift and were told it was because of our rate, although it is not an excluded rate on the website. The staff also argued about a $20 credit that we received when we booked our stay, even though it was plainly there on our reservation. The Loews ammenities that they tout were also not readily available, we asked for a sound machine after some sort of train went by one evening and we feared being awoken again, and we were told that they were out of sound machines. Not very useful. A few other minor incidents made us wonder if the staff has any training at all. Overall though, for the price (110/nt.) it wasn't too bad. Perhaps there is better out there, but I doubt they could beat this rate.

<Content>O.K. But not Luxury. This is a very good Hotel but would not classify it in the LUXURY category.. Excellent location, large, clean, comfortable room, very tasteful  timely in-room dining were all plusses. However,the service was not up to luxury hotel standards. Also the lobby area is somewhat small , bland and totally lacking in any charm.Dinner in the Restaurant Adelaide was excellent but a little pricey.Next visit to New Orleans will return to the Wyndham Hotel which is equal in every respect to Loews but, with an even better location, and a beautiful lobby over-looking the Mississippi River. .

<Content>Loew's doesn't live up to its "luxury" status According to its website, Loews was recently named best upper upscale hotel by business travellers. I'd like to meet those voters! To be fair the location is great; a nice 4-block walk gets you to Canal St. and the edge of the Quarter in no time. The CBD address also puts you close to streetcars and bus lines, the Riverwalk, great cafes and galleries of the Warehouse District and directly across the street from the venerable Mother's cafeteria (the lines out the door at lunchtime don't lie!) and Harrah's Casino (if that's your thing). The service, however, lacked a bit of luster from the get-go. I was dismayed that my room was not ready when I checked in at 1pm - as a member of a conference that had booked rooms months earlier! I was certainly fine with waiting 2 hours at the most as I was told. But when the room was still not ready upon my return at 3:30pm I was peeved - especially since my conference roundtable began at 4pm. I finally received a room at 5:00. Although spacious, the room was nothing fancy. And, ladies travelling together should consider this: there is no in room vanity table-and-mirror set-up so if you want to put on your make-up or dry your hair while your travelling companion showers in the bathroom, you are out of luck. In a city with so many luxury hotels with roof-top pools and quaint shabby-chic guesthouses with secret courtyards to choose from...choose something other than Loews.

<Content>Very disappointing My best friend and I took our mothers to New Orleans for a 5-day trip. While the hotel is good-looking and nicely laid out, service was terrible. Our rooms were pre-paid, yet not ready for our 6:30pm arrival. We requested rooms on the same floor; not done. We requested rooms with 2 beds; not done. Just a hassle from the beginning. Room service showed up only 3 days out of 5 and even then, service was lacking. We had to constanly ask for the mini bar to be restocked, for towels, for the garbage cans to be emptied. All minor things, but things too minor for a major hotel to have trouble with, and annoying enough to imapct our visit. To top it all off, 2 weeks after our departure, they double-charged us all over again for our lousy stay and it's been a nightmare trying to get them to clear this up, despite clear receipts for our original prepayment.

<Content>Very nice, good location We just got back from a 4 day stay at Loews, and I will say that almost everything at the hotel was flawless. The room was clean, beds were fluffy and comfy, the staff was helpful when you needed to go somewhere. The room wasn't really luxury by my standards, especially for the price, but very nice and adequate. I thought the rate was a bit high, and couldn't help but be a little shocked by the final bill, seeing that an additional $65 was added to the daily rate for parking and taxes. Next time we come to N.O., we may stay at the Hilton simply because the there was a trolly stop right at their front door, which conveniently takes you to the French Market, French Quarter, or other places. It was a couple of blocks from Loews, which on a nice day isn't a big deal, but when we were there it was often raining and it was cold. And you take your life in your own hands every time you cross one of N.O. streets. They will keep going even if they have to run you down. Also, directly across from Loews, there is a high rise going up, and we literally had cranes outside our room on the 13th (yes they have a 13th floor, but I'm not supersticious) starting at 8:00am. I believe it's a new Harrah's Hotel. All in all, we had a great time, and I could recommend this hotel to anyone.

We had a great view of the River, Riverwalk, Cruise Ships and Warehouse District. The Hotel is in a great location, short walk to the Quarter, across from from Harrahs, a block to Canal Place, a block from the Warehouse District, and 3 blocks to the St. Charles Streetcar. Mothers is across Poydras Street. You can walk everywhere and feel perfectly safe.Strongly recommend. (And no charge any more for coffee in the room.)

<Content>Friendly Service, great value for a luxury property Just came back from a trip to NOLA and stayed at Loew's. Very friendly and helpful staff. They even communicated with me by email and answered questions after I booked on a friendly and personal level. River view corner room at a great price (Triple A rate); lovely lobby and I heard the health club and pool were great (did not get a chance to try). Very comfortable beds with fluffy comforters. Luxury marble oversized bath with granite counter, separate shower and tub and nice toiletries, fluffy thick towels. Room was very neat and tidy and free New York Times daily - even Sunday! I was ill one night (over indulging on great NOLA food) and they sent up a Ginger ale because there was none in the mini bar. Very prompt housekeeping response if you needed anything. Very convenient location. Quick walk to the French Quarter, or walk across the street to Harrah's casino and cut through it to hop onto the waterfront streetcar for a quick 3 minute ride to the French market or Cafe' Du Monde and Jackson square. Also, walk to convention center easily or to the World Trade Center with rooftop rotating club and bar - great views. Across the street are the W hotel and then the Windsor Court. Lots of great restaurants are so close including Mother's across the street and August a block away, plus you can have elegant formal tea across street at Windsor Court hotel. My only complaint about the hotel was that there is no real gift shop inside for sudnries, but there are zillions of shops in NOLA and closeby; no mirror in the hotel room other than in the bathroom, but they also had a portable magnifying mirror in the bathroom to take into the bedroom; and what seems to be a current theme in hotel rooms that are newer - very very few drawers to put your clothes in!! Not sure why new hotels are discouraging longer stays but it seems that they are. Overall, you cannot beat this value and location in a luxury hotel in NOLA. Oh, we tried Adelaide's once for breakfast - service was so slow it was torture and we did not even order anything hot. THey still need to work on that place with regards to service. Too many other good breakfast places around to deal with that. (Try Petunia's for breakfast or lunch in the Quarter - yum)

The bathrooms were really nice with large shower stalls and a soaker tub. The fitness centre and pool were nice as well. We had Christmas dinner at Cafe Adelaide and loved the food and service. Really nice! The only downside is that there is no self-parking...only valet. Everything is within walking distance. The malls are very close by. Loved my time here...especially the little touches like the complimentary jazz cd and mints on your pillow.

<Content>Above and Beyond the Call I have been booking meetings for our Company for 3 years now.. and never have I been so pleased with what the Loews New Orleans had to offer... they are the most courteous, and have the most well-trained personnel I have seen at any hotel... I booked the Loews New Orlenas for a sales and operations meeting in Ausgust of 2003 for 130 people. I had so many of my fellow employee's compliment me on a choice of accommodations, food, and atmosphere... the food is a special note, and a big hats off to the most gracious people to prepare and serve, especially Virgil.... even when inadvertently bombarded with 40 more people for lunch one day... .. made sure that everyone was taken care of and acted as if it were already planned... His disposition and professionalism was with a heart of Gold... and a big Thank You to Lisette Ecuyer, Director of Catering and Conference Management whose help in planning and follow-through was more than I had expected and absolutely wonderful to work with ...accommodations were unmatched from anywhere our company had ever stayed... Thanks again Loews, New Orleans... pray we get the opportunity again...

<Content>Excellent Loews We stayed at Loews New Orleans for (sadly just) one night at Easter 2004. The hotel is wonderful, very plush, with very helpful staff and great cocktails in the bar! We were upgraded to a room on the top floor which was lovely. There is a good gym, and a cozy pool area, not ideal when there are children. We walked everywhere from the hotel. Being a Brit my husband was slightly put off by the amount of people expecting a tip - it took 4 people in rota to get one bag from our car to our room!
