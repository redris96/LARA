<Content>Toddler Treated Like VIP My wife, 18 month old daughter and I took the opportunity of connecting flights in FRA to take in the Christmas market for two days this past December and Villa Kennedy did not disappoint. When we arrived, there was a real wood crib for our daughter made with flannel sheets, a tiny robe and slippers and a little pack of baby toiletries. Wonderful. The staff would always smile and chat with her, even after she projectile vomited in the restaurant one morning. Cringe.All in all, they made the effort with us, but more importantly with our daughter - NOT something all hotels in this category do. Wonderful pool/spa. I read someone else say the food is a little on the pricey side and I'd agree with that - but honestly, this is a minor quibble. We've already recommended this hotel a number of times and if I ever have occasion to get back to Frankfurt I will most definitely be visiting again.PS - I noticed another commenter made the point that the Christmas Market is a 20 minute walk. Make no mistake, this is a walk you WANT to make to get a feel for the city - along the river you see everyone in Frankfurt getting out and enjoying themselves. Unless you physically can't walk for that time, it's sort of a must do anyway.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Everything about the hotel is 5 star, from the reception, where the receptionist walked us to our room, stunning spa area, reading room and concierge tips. A lovely touch is the gingerbread house, 6 feet high, which had sweets and chocolates stuck to it and was replenished every morning!Two small negative comments are that the the hotel is about a 20 minute walk away from the city centre/christmas market and it is very expensive if you want to eat/drink at the hotel

<Content>Great service - let down by minor points I stayed at the Villa Kennedy on a 1 night business trip last week. Great experience. Room (Suite) was huge and bed seemed twice as wide as it was long.Receptionist took me to my room to checkin - neat touch - and showed me the facilities. A couple of small niggles - the shower tray didn't have a non-slip surface so needed care and a small housekeeping point. The lamp bulbs on the dressing table lamps hadn't been dusted for a looong time.Breakfast restaurant was A1 and had all one could have wished for.Staff throughout were friendly and seemed genuinely pleased to see me.Contrary to what others have posted there were a number of taxis waiting in a rank inside the Hotel premises, but I guess it could be different when a big fair is on.Wish I could have stayed longer but will definitely be back.

<Content>I'll Be Back.... when I win the lottery I have just returned from an exhibition at the Messe in Frankfurt, we stayed at the Sheridan Hotel and the Villa Kennedy - and I must say if I ever won the lottery this is the hotel for me. I had just a standard room which was superb, the staff were excellent and just oozed service from every pore but without being patronizing if you know what I mean.The bed was enormous, and very comfortable, with linen sheets of the highest quality changed every day. At night there was a turn down the bed service and slippers (hotel provided) were laid on a mat at the side of the bed. 4 bottles of water (2x sparkling and 2 x still) were replaced each day by the bedside (FOC), but the best bit was the PILLOW MENU by the bed. One could choose between anti-allergic memory foam, anti-allergic something else, horse-hair (???), sphelt something or other (???), duck down, eider-down, something else down and my personal favourite was the CHERRY STONE PILLOW (????) don't ask - guess it was for the massaging of the neck whilst dreaming away the wee hours between luxurious linen sheets which adapt to every temperature change within your body keeping it at the maximum comfort temperature. .... I havent slept since I got home.... :) and keep telling my husband that the bed is not turned down and the slippers ready before I retire for the night.....!The food was excellent - Our company paid for a meal in the hotel and we chose the month special which was based around grapes for September. It was amazing with different glasses of wine included for each course. Wines you wouldn't probably choose yourself unless you are a wine buff of course. The staff were excellent - and would recommend this hotel to anyone. We managed to get a good deal considering it was in the middle of the exhibition and 3 nights in a standard room including breakfast was 拢500 (for the 3 nights per person). Bearing in mind that we were being charged 拢300-拢320 per person per night at the Sheridan - GOOOD VALUE AS WELL....shame the hubby wasn't with me... oh well - when we win the lottery we will go over for a couple of nights on the world tour...

<Content>best in Germany We spent 6 nights here in June 2008 and all of us (two kids aged 18 and 8 plus parents in separate room)had nothing but great things to say about the Villa Kennedy. Since we were here to spend quality time with friends and family in Frankfurt and Taunus we only experienced a few of the amenities this wonderful hotel has to offer. The breakfast buffet and dining was just wonderful. We had relaxed drinks in the courtyard with really great service. Overall, I've never experienced better service in any german luxury hotel, not even our favorite Mandarin Oriental in Munich! My friend had a massage at the Spa and kept raving about the incredible service. When we had difficulty turning on the A/C the front desk explained how the system worked in detail even though it was 11.30pm!! The only weird experience was the parking situation. After one day of questions about the parking garage we decided to do valet parking every time and that worked like a charm. Some wonderful waiter at breakfast remembered our little son's name after he tried to order in german but wasn't very successful. We will be back next summer and this time for a longer stay,thank you for making our time in Frankfurt a lovely experience!

<Content>Fabulous End to a Great Trip The Rocco Forte Villa Kennedy was an amazing hotel with wonderful service and great staff. This hotel was refreshing after a long flight from Nice to Frankfurt, for it is modern, cleverly designed, and very clean. Our room was incredible, for it was quiet, spacious, and very well designed. The spa was very clean and nice, with one of the best pools I've ever been in. Tip: look for buttons on the side of the pool to turn on surprise whirlpools! The restaurant at the Villa Kennedy was also very pleasant with great food and service to match.For me, this was one of the best hotels on my entire trip; unfortunately our stay was only for one night. Frankfurt is not a place that I'd ever really want to go back to, but I would go just to stay at this hotel!

<Content>Wonderful hotel, superb staff! Upon arrival in Frankfurt, things were looking grey. When I pulled up to Villa Kennedy, however, things looked beautiful! The hotel, from the inside out, is gorgeous! From the moment I checked in, to the moment I check out, the hotel staff was very eager to please! I tried my hand at German and they quickly and happily spoke to me in English. They were also great at recommending local restaurants with traditional fare. My room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. My only complaint would be that the sheets were extremely stiff and a bit uncomfortable.This was the first Rocco Forte hotel I stayed at and have returned to others very happily!

<Content>The Hotel that Saved Frnakfurt For years trips to Frankfurt meant mediocre hotels that were fine by German standards but if compared on an international scale were drab, boring, and an encouragement to get somewhere else in Europe as quickly as possible. Villa Kennedy has changed all of that. This was the first Forte Hotel I stayed with in Europe and I can say after trying four other of their properties all are (so far) seriously on to something. But back to Villa Kennedy. Thoughtful but efficient service, very comfortable rooms, exceptional restaurant with a lovely courtyard during the warm months, great location, and a wonderful tally of amenities easily place this hotel as THE place to stay in Frankfurt. While the low dollar has made it pricier than one might hope for it is well worth the splurge. Try for the rooms with balcony and terrace that are on the first floor...very nice and airy. In the winter months I prefer the attic rooms on the top floor for warmth and coziness. Do try the restaurant. Don't try a left turn into the hotel from the Kennedy Alle...the police do not appreciate it!

<Content>the saviour of Frankfurt - Villa Kennedy I was very disgruntled to find out that my company was sending me on a conference to Frankfurt. Images of a gray boring city loomed in my mind. However when I arrived at the Villa Kennedy that all changed. First of, the building itself looked more like a fairy tale castle than a hotel. The kind of place where footballer鈥檚 girlfriends would queue up to hold their weddings. Then the receptionist actually brought me to my room, which surprised me normally I just get a vague route description where the most the reception exerts here self would be to point out the direction of the lift. After which she was patiently answered my questions on what there was to do in Frankfurt. I was lucky enough to have been given an upgrade something that never happens to me, was so excited to see the room! I have to say it was not a letdown. The room was probably the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in. I even had a walk in wardrobe; something that I am ashamed to admit was probably the same size as my kitchen. The room came with a seating area and a small table and a substantially large television. The bed was absolutely divine and so large and comfy; if it were possible I would have brought it back with me! In the bathroom it was really handy as it came with a shower unit separate from the bath tub. Overall the room was refreshing, not over stuffed like a lot of the older luxury hotels, but simplistic and comfy. The only negative thing about the room was that the windows were quite small and made the room feel dark without the lights on. Also the air conditioning could only but adjusted by four degrees.The overall service was great, the staff were all really friendly always ready to help out hopeless guests with setting up projector screens and other such things! The food could not be faulted, although it would have been nice to have had some more traditional German food. However as the head chef was Italian the reasons as to why this is can be understood.I didn鈥檛 have enough time to use the spa, but I did go down and get a sneaky peek and it looks lovely. If I get the chance, next time Ill definitely be making an appointment. Overall, if my company asks me to go to Frankfurt again, I鈥檓 going to need a little bit less persuasion, the Villa Kennedy has in my eyes turned Frankfurt into an exciting and worthwhile destination.

<Content>Another good stay at Villa Kennedy Back to the Villa Kennedy again, another business trip with the whole team as we were attending an exhibition at the Messe Frankfurt. Really well located for the Messe. Don't know Franfurt too well but seems pretty well located for everything including the airport. Staff so friendly - couldn't fault them, have also stayed at Rocco Forte's Hotel De Rome Berlin - staff excellent there too. Sir Rocco knows how to train them. Food is very good albeit expensive as are drinks but bar area really nice and live music both evenings we were there. Rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms, high standard quite modern but not cheap and cheerful. Nice touches on arrival, homemade chocolates, welcome note etc. Definitely glad to be back, I think it's the best in Frankfurt.

<Content>Finally - A Great Hotel in Frankfurt I stayed at the Villa Kennedy for one night in late November 2007 during a business trip. This hotel is almost worth going to Frankfurt for. PROS: excellent service from the moment you arrive, beautiful comfortable rooms, amazing spa and pool, charming bar area, competitive prices, very good entertainment system, cleanliness, quiet, beautiful but unobtrusive interior decoration, nice contrast of old (building) and new (decor), efficient, cheery staff, close proximity to downtown, and a certain stylishness. Much more pleasant than the typical four or five star business hotel in Frankfurt. CONS: bed sheets need a little fabric softener. I recommended this hotel to all my German friends and would be happy to have the occasion to stay there again.

<Content>Not impressed, too Stayed one night in Nov07 on business in a standard room for 310 Euro incl taxes, without brkfst. 2 pics of rooms are already posted frm another tripadvisor member 鈥?photo 1 and 9 (which was taken at night). I dislike design of working and sofa area and think that it is really not adequate to a 5+ star hotel. Ok, tastes are different鈥?br/>There were several bugs with room and room maid - just to mention one: heating did not work. Unfortunately I did not realized that upon arrival. When I returned from a business meeting at 11 pm room was freezing cold (1 degree outside). Reception promised to talk with the technical department but nothing changed for one hour. Nobody come to room, nobody offered another room and at midnight I 鈥渃losed that matter鈥?More things worth to mention: - In-room internet access is 20 Euro for 24 hours. Internet access in so called business center (freezing, frequent passing by of staff and other people) costs 5 Euro for 15 minutes (line was very very slow). I always find it very annoying to pay for internet in luxury hotels. In my opinion there is something wrong with such a business model. - Phone calls in Frankfurt area are for free but other phone calls to Germany are very expensive (I think they at least quintuple)- Convenient location to airport (10 to 15 minutes by taxi)- Huge pool and nice spa which opens already at 06.30 am.My personal summary: impressive hardware (means exterior and partly interior design) but room for improvement in software (means services, thinking out of the box).

<Content>excellent stay We were on our way to Africa for a 2-week safari, and travelled on Lufthansa via Frankfurt. We arrived in Frankfurt around 7 am, and had previously notified the hotel we would be arriving early. They were able to accommodate an early-morning check-in for us, which we appreciated hugely. We did not fly out till the next evening, and they were also able to accommodate a late check-out. Obviously depends on what volume they are experiencing at any given time, but they were most gracious about it. Just what we needed for an overnight between 2 very long (10 and 12 hours each) flights. Spa service had an excellent masseur and very relaxing surroundings, good gym and pool. We loved our room, which had a separate sitting room. The hotel bar was a great spot to spend time for a nightcap, with pleasant piano music. Room service was prompt and efficient, as well as high quality food. The concierge provided excellent directions  map for a walk along the river to the historic area, a nice restaurant recommendation for dinner, and a wine festival in town that evening. Entire staff was welcoming and helpful. All in all, excellent experience and would recommend highly.

<Content>just an amazing hotel just an amazing hotel. easy check in with the front desk person taking us up to the room to explain everything. Beautiful large rooms with a separate sitting area and desk. Breakfast buffet in hotel restaurant had everything you would want to start your day. Did not go to the spa but other women in my travel group said it was one of the nicest they had been to. Great location. Wonderful concierge who recommended restaurants as well as sent me to a bike shop where i could rent a bike to ride around frankfurt for the day. I wish we could have stayed longer and unfortunately it was the first hotel of a 5 city german trip so I will have to compare every hotel to this one. I am not sure the Villa Kennedy can be topped. A must if you have an unlimited expense account since the rooms are very expensive but certainly worthwhile

<Content>I was amazed by the hotel's charm I was in Frankfurt, Germany for business. Since I always stay in the same hotels, I wanted to see something different.I heard of Rocco Forte Hotels in New York and I visited the website.When I arrived in Frankfurt, the Team at the Reception was very friendly and they escorted me up to my room. Room is actually not the right description, it was a suite and some lovely welcome amenities !! No idea why was bestowed the honour, maybe due to me arriving over the weekend, as I do not believe the citys麓 hotels are overwhelmed with leisure busankfurt only offers the usual, bog standard hotels. I really enjoyed my time there and would (although admittedly I havent seen the normal rooms:) recommend the rooms and impeccable service to all travelling to the city ! .Breakfast in their inner courtyard was also a delight and I will most definately be using the Villa as my nr. 1 address when travelling to Frankfurt in the future ! Thank you Rocco Forte !

<Content>Not Impressed We stayed at the Villa Kennedy for just one night and that was enough. Although the rooms (we had two) were quite fine, we had some difficulty with administration. Our rooms had been paid for through our travel company, but the hotel did not think so and argued with us regarding our bill wherein we were charged again for the rooms. The hotel should not have argued with us, rather, they should have taken the charges off and contacted the travel company. They always have our credit card on file so if there's an issue, they will get their money! The hotel also called us a taxi instead of getting a limo as we had been promised and the taxi was too small for the 4 of us and all our baggage. So we crammed into the taxi with baggage on our laps so as not to be late for our flight. Speaking of late, we asked for coffee, tea and toast to be delivered at 6:00 am because we had to leave at 6:30 and it was not delivered until 6:15, so we really had no chance to enjoy it. Not a stellar stay at the Villa Kennedy!!
