<Content>Good location, fabulous rate Stayed at the Rosedale for 3 nights. Paid CAD$110 a night including tax / service. Room rate includes free in-room internet access, but no breakfast (not a big deal considering whole bunch of restaurants/ bakeries / fast-food joints are within 5mins walking distance). Hotel is located right in Causeway Bay. About an 7-8min walk to the subway station and the Sogo Department store area. It's faster if you go through the pedestrian foot-bridges but you can also avoid all of them by taking a slight detour, which will take about 10-12 mins to the subway station. However, there is a tram station located right outside of the hotel so if you're familiar with the tram system, you can hop on/off easily (it costs much less than the subway- HKD$2 flat rate). Rooms are reasonably sized (by Asian cities standard) - about 200 square feet. It's a basic hotel so don't expect any spa-like amenities - just clean, tidy and functional room (and relatively new, 5 years). It is a great place to just crash at night after spending all day shopping / sight-seeing. There is a free shuttle that runs between the hotel (a brief 2min walk from main entrance) and the Airport Express - Hong Kong Station. It runs every 20mins. The hotel also provide a shuttle service directly to the airport at HKD$130 per person. They also provided 2 bottles of drinking water (complimentary) in the room daily, which is great considering the tap water in HK is not suitable for drinking.

<Content>Very small rooms, poor breakfast but location is great for shopping I booked a stopover with Cathay in this hotel. If you are outside for shopping this hotel is very good, if you need to do some work in the room: Don't book this hotel. I stayed alone but with two people it must be awful.Causeway Bay is about 5-10 minutes by walk away,everything is nearby, a park to relax, good restaurants and so on...

<Content>Liked it The hotel is new and well maintained. Though the rooms are small, they have good facilities like flat panel tv, a bay window with sitting, umbrella. I was on the 31st floor and had a decent view of the mountains, HK Stadium and Causeway Bay. The only thing I didn't like so much was the walk to the MTR station. It's in Causeway Way, but in an awkard location. You had to walk up the stairs and get on the overpass no matter which entrance you took.

<Content>Value for money Rosedale is the place to go if you want clean, well located and affordable accomodation in HK. Rooms are big enough, bathroom had all the amenities you could have expected for and staff were helpful. I had initially booked a guesthouse in the area but had a change of heart. Rosedale being recommended by my guidebook, I just went there and they found me a room instantly for a price that was very close to their lowest, advanced booking, internet fare. Only downside is their business centre and its pricey internet connection if you haven't got your own PC.

<Content>Junior Suite very nice We stayed for four nights in a junior suite. Very glad we got a junior suite because husband and I brought our five year old and 11 month old boys along. The infant had ample space to crawl around and when sleeping time came we pulled out the sofa bed and our older son had a comfortable sleep as well. Don't know where else in HK we could've got such good space for the price we paid. Only thing we didn't do was ask for a higher floor. We got 17th floor and found ourselves facing the apartments right across. For a view, I think one has to go above 20 floors. Restaurant on top floor was quiet and the view was really nice. Food so so, not too expensive for the experience and a relaxing evening. Location of hotel is ok, about 15 minutes walk to Sogo and MTR, for people with strollers the concierge can direct which way to walk to avoid climbing up and down overhead bridges. Victoria Park is across the road, nice for leisurely walk.

<Content>Convenient location, clean and pleasant staff We stayed there over the weekend. It's very conveniently located, especially if you know how to cut across certain roads etc. It takes us less than 10 minutes(with our 4 year old!) to get to Park Lane hotel area where there are cafes, a 24 hour supermarket and a certain well known toy shop!Although the hotel is old but the rooms are relatively clean, small yes but we know Hong Kong hotels usually have small rooms, even the bigger chain hotels, unless you are willing to pay a lot more.I think it's worthwhile considering this hotel if you are out most of the day and just need a nice comfortable place to sleep after a day of shopping or sightseeing.Staff were very friendly and courteous. We came earlier than check in time, the lady at the check in apologized for not being able to give us our rooms as they were being cleaned. Was worried about getting a smoking room as I would only be back late in the evening but the lady assured us the room has been kept for us, and it was when we came back! I would stay here again, as I think it's value for money.

<Content>ROSEDALE on the PARK Experience I had our nephew who lives in HK and is a top banker executive scout the Rosedale for us. He talked to the top person he could get and Ms K C and I emailed through months before we got to HK. We got 3 junior suites and I can only say great comments about everybody and every experience in Rosedale. The managers and staff bend over backwards to please us and make us feel at home.They are kind and compassionate.We will definitely go back for our yearly long stays in HK ( Annual Family Reunion) and actually invited other members from abroad to stay in Rosedale.I know it is not the Shangri-la or the Grand Hyatt or the Hilton or Kempinski of Moscow but it is Home Sweet Home for us in Hongkong!  We used to stay with family in HK but we need our own space when we come. Thank you Ms K C and staff and managers for a great time!Thank you, our Hongkong big Family for 2007 Reunion....See you all soon.

<Content>Would definitely stay again We decided to stay here for our first trip to Hong Kong after reading the reviews on this website and were very pleased with our choice. The hotel is in a very central but quiet location (just off a main road) and can be easily reached by tram or MTR (Tin Hau less than 5 min walk from the hotel - turn right on the main road and walk past the library!)Very nice, clean rooms - compact but with all the necessary amenities. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Beautiful views from the hotel bar on the 33rd floor - would definitely recommend it. Also free use of internet if you buy a drink from the bar.We would definitely stay again, as not as touristic as Kowloon where you get constantly interrupted by people trying to sell you custom made suits!

<Content>Stay somewhere else We stayed in this hotel in August 2007. We arrived at our hotel from the Vigor airport bus which we prearranged along with our hotel through Dragonair. We stood around in the airport looking for our names on a sign. We were not told in advance that we had to go to a desk called Vigor to get our ride. A nice tour guide saw us standing around for 20minutes and helped us find our ride. Then we sat around for another 30 minutes for our bus.Anyways, when the bus dropped us off (an hour later) we had to haul our own luggage (which was a lot since we had been travelling for 2 months staying in hotels) while the bell boys and consierge stood around. Then after we did all this hard work, they recieved a tip for taking the suitcases up the elevator.The rooms are extreemly small and even the no smoking floor stinks of smoke. The eleavators are extreemly slow and inefficient. The breakfast is horrible!!!! It always took a long time for the maid to clean our room.However, the hotel is in a fairly good location. But others are closer. It is a ten minute walk to the closest subway station, Causeway Bay, beside Times Square Mall. I wouldn't recommend staying in this hotel. There are hotels closer to transportation. While in Hong Kong, I recommend that you go to Lo Wu. However, a Hong Kong Visa is not enough. You will need a passport with a mainland visa. It takes about an hour on the train and is quite an experience. Lo Wu is full of great fakes but is a bit intimidating as people chase you around the giant mall and constantly are ducking from the police. You would think that Hong Kong would have great fakes, but I guess the police have really cracked down so you have to go to the mainland (Lo Wu)for the stuff. Locals were on the train with empty suitcases, we guessed to haul their goods home. The mall is called Lo Wu Commercial City. I think it cost us $5us to go to Lo Wu from Causeway Bay. If you want the real stuff there are tons of stores in Hong Kong with fairly good prices. They don't hassle you for bringing the fakes back, as long as you have a minimal amount. The fakes were quite expensive. A really nice fake purse, supposedly leather, was $200us after 30 minutes of bargining. A ladies Gucci watch was $30.We were really disapointed in Stanley Market, Ladies Market, MK, and the Temple Street Market. We found a lot more interesting buys in other parts of asia.

<Content>Great Hotel I would highly recommend Rosedale on the Park. We tried to book via the on line web site but it wasn't a secure site so we booked through expedia. Apart from that slight hitch we had a fantastic time, when we checked in we were told that we were going to be upgraded to a larger suite and it was fantastic. We had a seperate bedroom with a very comfy bed and a larger sitting room with kitchenette. The staff were all very friendly and we tried out the room service and the food was fantastic. We ate breakfast in the hotel and got the buffet for $70HK each, a discount of 30% because we were guests. I would recomend this hotel for either a long or short term stay.

<Content>Average to above average, good value. After reading a fair few reviews on this site and having decided I didnt want to pay for 5 star on this trip I settled for Rosedale on the Park which seemed to have pretty good reviews, compared to the hotel I had previously booked which didnt fayre too well.Anyone who has stayed in Hong Kong will know that the difference between 4 star bottom and 5 star top is very significant and in most cases you really do get what you pay for..With Rosedale, it is cheap, I compared it against 3-4 other 4 star hotels I knew of and it was about $70aus cheaper so thats a bonus. Rooms are small, but again, experience in Hong Kong tells you that you will get a small room in 4 star on a budget.I was upgraded to an exec room which is no different to a superior, but it is higher up, had a nice view and a double bed. The bed was fantastic, really comfortable with a big Duvet so I slept like a champion 3 nights in a row which is good for me when travelling.pro's and cons.pro's- good value compared to many other 4 star hotels- breakfast buffet was cheap, again, compared to other places but was probably of 3 star quality- location great, right on Victoria Park and C. Bay shops- quiet, didnt here a pin drop outside my room- staff very friendly and keen to assist - free internet in room, which was great, I used my laptop and the cable and it was really fastCons- Small room, i travelled alone and was fine, might struggle with 2 people for more than a few nights.- majority of staff get by on English, I had some communication issues with front desk and housekeeping (nb their English way better than my chineese tho, but not the point)- Not an issue for me, but this hotel was probably 95% occupied by Chineese tourists, if you are after a western hotel with lots of European travellers, this isnt the one for you.- Gym is tiny, one treadmill, one bike, some weights and a multi workout machine. More than 3 people in gym would be overcrowded and some of their marketing is a bit misleading, touting it as a room with treadmills in plural and much eqt.Overall, a good comfortable stay, it didnt exceed my expectations nor did under deliver. Would I stay here again? Probably not, but that is because there are so many hotels in HK and like to move around, not a reflection on the hotel itself.TIPS - The laundry costs are a joke, it costs about $60hk for one pair of jeans and $30Hk per pair of underpants. Youd spend $700HK on a load of washing (as much as a nights accomm). DONT DO IT, head right out of hotel and left down an alley about 50 metres from hotel and there is a laundry and the lady will do a whole bag of washing and drying for you for $30HK dollars which is about $4Aus.Same with minibar, you can go to the 24 hour servo and buy 4 cans of beer, 4 cans of diet coke and some noodles for the same price as a bottle of water and bottle of sprite in the mini bar.

<Content>Lovely Hotel My boyfriend and I just got back from an 8 night stay at the Rosedaleand we both loved it. True the room wasn't huge, we had normal room rather than a suite, however, although this is the first time I had been to HK I have heard many times that unless you spend a lot of money at one of the larger hotels or on a suite small is what you will get. Anyway, it was big enough for us and it was spotlessly cleaned everyday. We went to HK for the rugby 7's and this hotel could not have been more perfect for this, it was just a 10 minute walk from the stadium and we could actually see it from our bedroom window, we did not go to the games on the Friday night but before we went out we watched them via the big screen in the ground from our window.It's a short walk from the MTR and there was nearly always a taxi parked outside. Then from the MTR we were only 1 stop to Wan Chai and3 to Central, when you consider that a one way ticket on the MTR costonly HKD 5 (less than 50p) to Central, I think that's pretty impressive. Plus do not miss the Skyzone on the top floor, it was some lovely views.Overall I loved the Rosedale and like everywhere we went to in HK, everyone was very helpful and plesant.

<Content>Great place for a second stay!!! Okay, let's give this boutique hotel an exhaustive review because the property has earned a fair shake. If this is your first trip to Hong Kong and likely to be your one and only visit, start looking elsewhere and be prepared to pay for your stay! Most importantly, don't complain - you will get that for which you will pay! The great thing about Hong Kong, as opposed to Shanghai, is that your money has value. Despite paying for service found wanting (e.g. Westin -Shanghai) or paying for rooms which should have a view and don't (e.g. Westin - Shanghai), Hong Kong has great hotels in great places like the Admiralty and Central areas. Be prepared to pay for the Harbor View, bite your lip and shell out the dough. You will get your money's worth and everyone will be pleased.However, if this is your second, third or fourth trip to Hong Kong, then the Rosedale on the Park (much like the Royal Park in Sha Tin) is a real treat. The property is clean as a whistle, situated close to the Trams for endless tramming for pennies and close to the bus stop for cheap rides around town, as well as up to the peak (#15) and over to the Star Ferry (#8). The elderly should be cognizant that staying at this little wonder will require a fair amount of walking unless the local cabs (ready and waiting) are used for quick trips to the shopping areas in reasonable proximity (Times Square and the Island Area). Don't be discouraged - all the hotels require a little hoofing. Between Rosedale on the Park and the Park Lane, the junior suite at the Rosedale is a much better deal than a standard room at the Park Lane. They are more than likely priced comparably and the junior suite is a far superior deal. The Park Lane appears, deceivingly, to be a better deal, but the Rosedale on the Park simply shines. A great fish venue is right across the street and a more than reliable steakhouse is right around the corner. A 7-11 is close, too. The junior suite at the Rosedale is a great deal and perfect for stays of three days or more. Also, the local grocery store is 5 minutes away where water, coffee, bananas, oranges and simple staples (cookies) can be purchased to defray otherwise unnecessary expenditures. The junior suite is superbly well equipped with a microwave, ironing board, electric coffee/tea pot, safe, bar sink, internet access and two tee-vees. The bathroom is kind of small (not enough room to swing a cat around), but immaculately clean and the towels are fresh everyday, friendly and plump. The Rosedale, like the Royal Park Hotel, is a great value. The staff at the front desk is great - the Concierge and guys at the front door should invest in an Aloha shirt and learn from the Hawaiians (you only get one chance to make a first impression). Overall, a great find and a wonderful place to stay in Hong Kong, especially if you know your way around. If you don't, ride the Trams, take the Buses, learn the layout and head back to the Rosedale - a little home away from home. The Rosedale gets a good grade. Very nicely done and very, very comfortable. Hint: Ask for the southwest or northwest views and try to get over the 25th floor. Priceline Europe provided a great rate. Rating the dough for the deal - the Rosedale is a big winner.

<Content>Met all expectations! I am currently staying here for 3 nights.We booked a Junior Suite and am glad that we did. It has a nice bedroom with a seperate lounge area. The lounge area has a sofabed, a small dining table, coffee table, microwave and TV. There is another TV in the bedroom, with ensuite bathroom. Staff have been very pleasant and the view from the 30th floor is quite nice with a harbour view ( if you look left :) ) Overall , happy with this hotel which is not that far a walk from busy Times Square. It is not very hot at the moment at all, which makes walking around very pleasant indeed.Shops galore few minutes away! The gym is quite small but adequate and cool ( good air con! ) Free broadband is a definate bonus!! Hence I am writing this report after checking my emails from the comfort of my room without having to worry about extra charges!!For those without laptops, there is computer facilities downstairs but they charge 40 hong kong per half hour.

<Content>Impressed We stayed here for 4 nights in November 2006. The location of this hotel is very good. In Causeway Bay located within walking distance of the Hong Kong Underground, which is brilliant. Get yourself an Octopus card at the customer services counter and travelling around is ultra easy and convenient on the underground. The Hotel room was a little on the small side but was nicely furnished with a good standard of cleanliness.The service at this hotel was very good. The staff were very helpful and polite. The hotel bar is on the 33rd floor with great views of the city and a nice place to check your emails and wind down. The restaurant was also very good. The food and the service were both excellent. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Hong Kong and we thought it was great value for money. Hong Kong is a fantastic city and we enjoyed our visit immensely.

<Content>Great Value Hotel This is a great value hotel in Hong Kong. The rooms are not new and the views are average, but if you want a decent size room, conveniently located, quiet and under US$200, then this is the place. A full breakfast is included. The hotel is located blocks from the metro station (though you have to go up and over some overpasses, so not recommended for anyone in a wheelchair or having trouble getting around). The rooms are big enough (in Hong Kong you can't expect too much). We went for a safer bet and booked a suite (which gives you an extra room if one of you likes to stay up late and watch tv...the price difference was not substantial). There is interenet access available if you do not have a laptop.

<Content>Great Hotel. Great Location. We stayed in a junior suite from Sept 28th-Oct 8th. Our room was really two rooms: Bedroom and Livingroom/Dining room combo. Friends travelling with us for only 5 days stayed in the lowest level room which looked identical to our bedroom. This was fine for 5 days, but for 12 days I am so happy we took the recommendation of someone from this forum to book the junior suite. Plenty of space for a longer visit.I also want to thank the person on this forum who said to look for the hotel's Long Staying Package. This offered a great rate for more than 7 days. We paid only $6 CDN more a night than our friends. Difference for the lowest room was $141 versus $91 if they had stayed 2 more days.The hotel was clean and the staff friendly. Loved the free fruit basket each week as well as the starter free mini-bar on arrival.We were on the 26th floor and our friend's on the 20th. Both were non-smoking floors. Also both had a queen size bed which was very much welcomed after a 12-day tour in China where we had to share a double bed.I also loved the location of the hotel. 10 minutes to the MTR and right outside was the Tram which we love to ride. So many restaruants to choose from and a great place to just walk around late at night. Only thing we hated was Causeway Bay on Sundays. It seems that all the Philapino amahs go to Central on Sundays and the Indonesian amahs go to CB. You couldn't move.Also nice to have Victoria Park across the street and the Central Library next door when we wanted to get away from the crowds.The one thing my husband hated about the hotel was the popular bar Skyzone on the 33rd floor. The Rosedale only has 3 elevators and there was always one stuck on the 33rd floor.Would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely!!!

<Content>Get a suite. If you stay here, get a suite, otherwise it鈥檚 not worth it. From the website, you can鈥檛 tell the difference between all the 鈥渘on-Victorian鈥?suites so here鈥檚 the deal. Aside from the Victorian, all the suites are the same, the only difference is how high up the floor is and accordingly the better the view. The views from the hotel aren鈥檛 so hot, so I鈥檇 recommend going with the cheapest suite, which is a nice size room and twice as large as a much more expensive regular room at the Grand. For the price of a junior suite, in a 鈥淏udget Hotel鈥?you can鈥檛 beat it. We did have a problem with the reservations. We booked over the internet and neither of our two rooms was available when we arrived. We had to take a suite on a lower floor, but, same room, just less of a view and cheaper. The breakfast that came with the room was nice, the people friendly. Be prepared to explain to taxi drivers how to get there, many don't know where it is. Try showing them your room key, it has the address on it.

<Content>Great Place. Good Value This hotel is lovely. The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and well presented. Services are up to expectations, and the location is superb.By Hong Kong standards the rooms are normal in size. For a modest charge, I suggest an upgrade from a Standard Room to a Baby Suite. That gave us plenty of spare room and a kitchenette with microwave.We stayed 6 nights and will definitely return.

<Content>Other than small room, its a nice place to stay Rosedale On The Park is no longer a Best Western. The Hotel itself was much smaller than expected but the location to an MTR Subway station and Victoria Park was nice. There are stores and restaurants within easy walking distance. Our room was amazingly small for 2 adults with full sized bags. If you are over 6 foot tall, you may find the bed to be too short. Floor space is almost non-existent in a room with two beds鈥?if someone is sitting at the desk, the other person has no choice but to climb over the beds to get past. The bathroom is on the small side too鈥?almost no counterspace for two people to put their stuff. Our non-smoking room was very clean, and well maintained. Our view from the 12th floor was straight into an old apartment building so basically we keep the curtains closed. Rooms closer to the top of the building have better views over the building we faced. FREE internet access in the room was a nice touch and if you don鈥檛 have a computer, they have one available free in the Sky Lounge on the top floor. The free mini-bar consisted of 5 cans (beer/soda) on our first night. The staff of the hotel is friendly and professional.

<Content>Big Bang for your Buck! The location of the hotel was fabulous as it was only five minutes walk from Causeway Bay which is the centre of some major shopping. In turn, it is right across the street from Victoria Park and half a block away from the Hong Kong Central Library, which has hundreds of computers offering free internet. The rooms were clean and cosy and were equipped with every little thing one could need including: a free first round of mini bar goods including water and pop, free toothbrushes, free slippers, down comforters etc. The staff was friendly, although there were a few minor mishaps due to miscommunications. The lobby is clean and elegant, and everyone tried to be as helpful as possible.The downsides were that the beds were a tad on the hard side, but that is a personal observation. Depending on who is in the room next to you, the walls can be kind of thin - but the hotel moved us to a different room without any hassles at all.The rooms were relatively small, by North American standards, but I was prepared for that having read previous reviews online. Once you expect that, the hotel is a delight. The Rosedale was built in 2001, and when I went, the rooms were just starting to look a little bit faded and not-as-new. I would recommend this hotel if you are going in the next little while/ years but unless Management makes an effort to carry out the ongoing care and renovations needed in any hotel, the rooms are in danger of becoming shabby. Currently though, everything is in great condition.All in all, highly recommended and as I paid a bit less than $90 CDN per night (last two weeks of August 2005), this hotel is fantastic value.

<Content>Great value for money At a price of less than 700 HKD which you can find on many of the lastminute booking web sites, this is definitely great value. Rooms are nice sized (for Hong Kong) and the bathroom includes a bath and not just a shower. Free broadband in all the rooms is a great plus. They have no smoking floors as well.Nearby you have all the shops of Causeway Bay and a really nice vegetarian restaurant across the road.To get here, take the MTR to Causeway Bay and leave via Exit E. From the airport, take the airport express to Central and then you can either take the free hotel shuttle bus (line H2) which takes you to the Regal hotel, just opposite the Rosedale (but you have to stagger across a pedestrian bridge with your bags!)

<Content>Great hotel for the price Considering the price this is a very good hotel. The staff was very friendly and happy to help when we needed them. Free internet access was very usefull even if you can also go on the internet in the library next to the hotel, the location of the hotel is excellent, very close to the park, shopping and the metro. We tried the roof bar but it was a waste of time.

<Content>Not bad for a budget hotel Stayed here in October 2004. Room was small for 2 people, average service from the staff. We upgraded to a deluxe room without a inter connecting door to excape the noise next door. The deluxe room was exactly the same, same size, same interior except it was in dark wood not beech. If darkwood is supposed to be classier, they need not have bothered. It looked worse!They porter helpfully informed us that all rooms were the same size apart form the suites on the top floor.Avoid the bar and restauarnt upstairs, the service was amateur and expensive. Cheena Restaurant however was a lovely chinese restaurant that did not serve pork - highly recommeneded and guests get 20% off. One disadvantage was that some Taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was as its tucked away in a very small side street.Free internet is available in the Central Library across the road and there is a local laundry in the alleyway just off the hotel. V cheap and quick, but be warned they tumble dry everything. Cafe Coral is the cheap eat around the corner next to a 7-11.Recommended if if you can secure a good rate, avoid rooms with interconnecting doors. No point booking a deluxe room!
