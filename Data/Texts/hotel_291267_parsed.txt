<Content>A total dump, unfriendly hostile staff and a rip-off - NEVER AGAIN! It took forever and a day to get registered at the front desk, plus they couldn't find our name and treated us as if we were lying about our reservation. I had to look at their list myself and sure enough, they spelled our name wrong. Needless to say the staff was really grumpy about it, no apologies. Once we were in our room, we made the mistake of walking around in our barefeet and found the bottom of our feet were black! I don't think they've shampooed their carpet since it was constructed 40 years ago. It's a really old hotel and it smells old and moldy too. Breakfast was not outstanding and really expensive. I made a point of reserving the airport shuttle early the day before in the afternoon only to find that they didn't book it the next morning and they were really hostile about the whole situation. The only reason I took this hotel because I was mislead by the website saying Rated Three (3) Diamonds by AAA; Recipient of Multiple Hospitality Awards - totally false advertising!

<Content>Don't go here..... We booked this hotel for three nights and unfortunately this hotel did not meet our expectations at all. At first we had to wait almost two hours before the shuttle arrived to pick us up from miami airport, even though the hotel promised us to pick us up within 20 minutes. The driver did not speak english, he could only say happy today, everything okay, while driving 20 mph where 40 mph was the minimum speed and paying more attention to his phone than the road. The drive to the hotel took about 45 minutes and we were glad to get out of the shuttle, only to see the horrible state of the hotel itself. It's very grey and dull inside and the rooms are not properly cleaned at all. We found hairs of other people in the room, and the carpet was so dirty we did not want to walk without shoes on. Fortunately the hotel has free internet, so after the first inspection of the room we immediately booked another hotel (Sofitel airport, just 40 dollars more, but totally different atmosphere and quality and close to the airport) and we were out of there within 20 minutes.

<Content>very unfriendly The restaurant staff is very unprofeshonal, and very unfriendly.They don't seem to care about the service they must give, but just the salary the would begetting. eople that work in the hotel must be trained, and they must understand taht they are not only harming the reputation of them selve, but is also ruining the reputation of the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family.

<Content>Worth the money Booked the Hotel for 4 Days for Shopping Trip. The Hotel exceeded my expectations. The staff at the lobby was very helpful and courteous. The complimentary bus shuttles was very convenient. The rooms were comfortable and the complementary breakfast was enough. The only problem was the carpet in the rooms seems to be a little dusty.

<Content>Needs an urgent extreme makeover, overpriced We just came back from our vacation and stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. First, they advertise the hotel as an airport hotel and it is over 20 minutes away from the airport, you cannot even see or hear the airport from the hotel.It isn't located in the best neighborhood. At night they park a police patrol at the entrance and we saw a security guard in the parking lot at night. They have huge signs everywhere in the parking lot that say that We are not responsable for items.... or something in that sort.The hotel website has a sign that says that this was an award winning hotel (that's what made me make our reservations there). I don't think they are referring at this particular hotel. It is old and the common areas (specially the carpets) are really dirty and old. The rooms are just OK. The staff isn't helpful at all. We tried to store some of our suitcases at the hotel while we were on a cruise and the front desk told us that they had nothing to do about it and that we had to arrange that directly with the bell boys. The breakfast was poor in choices. Will NEVER stay there again for sure, look for other options!

<Content>Glad to be out of there! On our last night in Florida, we decided to stay near the airport. After calling around and asking at several hotels, we ended up at Howard Johnson. And I really mean ended up!The lady at the front desk gave me the feeling I really disturbed her by trying to check in. And I didn't even discuss with her. I just asked for the room price, agreed, gave her my credit card and made the mistake to ask if I could earn American Airline Miles with a stay there. She said annoyed NO!, and it was finished for her.Acutally, you can earn AA-Miles there (as the sign on the desk next to her sais...). The hotel advertised big with free Wi-Fi Internet, which would have been very helpful for us on the day before flying back to Trinidad, with organizing our day, the rental car return, etc.Unfortunately there was no wifi in the room. The was a plugin for an ethernet cable, which wasn't there neither. I didn' even bother to ask at the front desk for one.We had to go the the chaotic lobby for getting a wifi-connection. Terrible! People running around, everybody is stressed (since the front desk lady doesn't make things easier) and there was a funny smell.Acutally the whole hotel had a funny smell, toilet like. I don't really know.After all, the room was quite clean. The bathroom was a bit dirty, anyhow. The A/C was very old. We were afraif of breaking it, when we tried to regulate the temperature. We had the coice: hot or cold! That was it!We couldn't open the window, since we had the highway in front of it.It was very loud at Howard Johnson. At 1 a.m. some body thought it was funny to give us a call on the room telephone. When we answered, sleepy, nobody was there. We didn't think it was funny, anyhow.....Two hours later a group of guests came back from where ever and decided to let the whole hotel know. When that noise went away after some time, our neighbours put on their TV, so that I was standing in bed.I didn't get any sleep and had to fly back to Trinidad the next day.In the morning, there was a complementary breakfast. They had donoughts, juice, some croissants and toast. It was allright for free, although the breakfast room smelled funny as well.......The ckeck out was like the ckeck in. It was the same lady (I wonder if she was working the whole night. That would explain her mood, but still it shouldn't be my problem...), she was still annoyed and was happy to get rid of me so fast.After all, we figured out, that it shouldn't call itself an airport hotel, since the airport is about 7 miles away from the hotel.....I would never ever consider to stay at that particular Howard Johnson again. And since I didn't hear too much good stuff from the other Howard Johnsons, I think that something else would always be my first choice.

<Content>If you want sleep - Don't Stay Here! There is a club on the first floor of this hotel that goes until 4 AM - and if you're staying on the third floor - Good Luck trying to sleep! All night long you can hear the continual thump-thump of the music downstairs. The front desk said they couldn't even check to see if they could move us until 1 AM (so call back, then) and since we had a 6AM flight, moving in the middle of the night was not an option (or staying up till 1AM to call). The club parking took all of the guest parking, and the noise of the freeway could be heard in the room during the day. There was police activity downstairs at the club, and we did not feel safe in the parking lot (since we had to park in the rear near the garbage). The air conditioning was either off or on full blast (and noisy). They need to invest in digital thermostats! Breakfast was a very poor selection. The internet was painfully slow. The room was dusty and the bedside lamps were WAY too bright for night reading. The bathroom fan sounded like a small jet-engine. When we first arrived, we were early so they said to come back at 1:00. We came back at 1:00 and then they said come back later. So we decided to try the spa on the 2nd floor. DON'T GO THERE unless you're into torture! We got manicures  pedicures and she actually drew blood a few times, plus we're fairly certain there was no sterilization between customers. We were actually sore the next day and the throbbing pain in our toes also made sleeping difficult. Oh, and the sleep timer did not work on the tv. I will NOT be returning to this hotel and I'd strongly discourage anyone else from staying there.

<Content>You don't want to go here.. Unless you don't mind a strangers hair in your bathroom or muck you can literally pick up from your room's floor - don't go! This hotel's long waiting time at the check-in counter, shabby looking lifts and corridors speaks of it's standards before you have even reached the rooms. The public restrooms in the lobby were filthy. We were shown 3 rooms, not one cleaner than the other, and eventually left to find another hotel. For a lesser price you should be able to find higher quality accommodation.

<Content>Nice Room We arrived late from Kingston Ja as flight was delayed. As soon as we cleared Customs I called the hotel and asked about the shuttle. Was told it would be there in 30 mins. There needs to be better clarification as to where exactly you need to meet as it was a little confusing. When the shuttle came the driver didn't even get out to take our bags...no tips for him! It was rather late so check in was fairly quick and we were given our keys in no time. We were very tired but hungry, so we asked about food...were advised that only light stuff available, which was OK. When we went to the Restaurant we realized it was Disco Night and it was extremely loud...our order was taken rather quickly, but it took forever to come out...Overall, the only weaknesses I found were the breakfast buffet, which needs serious revamping, but was filling...and it would be really nice if they could provide a minifridge. All in all, our room was quiet and we had no problems at all...the shuttle was available for the Mall and Walmart, however, when we went on Monday at 11:30 am the driver only told us when we reached that he would be coming back at 3pm! Fortunately, a taxi ride was only about $5. Will definitely be back

<Content>Ok for just 1 night This hotel was just OK! The front desk staff were just OK! The room was just OK! The FREE breakfast was rubbish, nothing great, i've had better. I would not recommend this hotel, our room request was a non-smoking room, but was obviously a smoking room previous, it smelled stale and there were cig burn holes in the bedding, we stayed for just one night on the way up from Key West to Orlando and just went in without pre booking.The hotel was smack in the middle of the highway which made it noisy, the pool was freezing cold and the hot tub jaccuzzi was cold and didnt work! I'm glad we were moving on the next day.

<Content>Recommend Howard Johnson to Friends and Family Ometa and Margaret, BarbadosWe spent a week in November of 2006 at the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel, Hialeah Gardens, Miami, Fla. The concierges and bell staff were very helpful I would describe them as excellent although some of them could not speak English fluently. The rooms were clean and well maintained the house keeping staff was friendly although limited in English. Good location for shopping to pack barrels (Wal-Mart, KMart, BJ's Wholesale). However, some reception staff left a lot to be desired. The hotel shuttle is limited. A private shuttle system is needed to transport guests to Sawgrass Mills Mall, Opa Locka Flea Market, Adventure Mall and other far out shopping areas. What should be done is have a flyer printed and given to guests on arrival. In this flyer would be detailed information on the shopping areas, the date and time the shuttle would be leaving and the fare. Then we can get together in groups and shop at these far out shopping areas; thus making the fare a lot cheaper as a group. Last year we saw private shuttles with three or four guests coming and going and when we enquired we were told they had just came back from such and such a place.Check-in time needs to be done quicker you have to wait in long queues, or sit around for long periods of time in the lobby before you are taken to your room. This makes guests frustrated, because you are already tired from your jet lag and going through Immigration and Customs at Miami Intl.We believe that a small refrigerator should complement the room, in case you have frozen items to be stored.Breakfast selection was limited especially when everyone is doing their best to eat healthy. The Hotel shuttle was often late and we along with other guests almost missed our check in time at the Airport as a result. We have to compliment one of the front desk staff sorry we missed her name who took all of us to the airport very early that morning.Despite those few set backs we loved staying at the Hotel.

<Content>Has potential but... The concierges and bell staff were excellent. The rooms were clean and well maintained. Good location for shopping to pack barrels (Walmart, KMart, Bj's Wholesale). However, some reception staff left alot to be desired. The breakfast selection was limited and offered stale croissants and over ripe fruits. The advertised shuttle was often late and we almost missed our check in time as a result. No apologies were given. Furthermore, when I contacted front desk as to the whereabouts of the shuttle my call was treated as a mere nuisance and I was disconnected wether intentionally or accidentally.

<Content>Not bad for the price My husband and I ended up spending a night here completely unplanned, when my car broke down on the Turnpike. For the price, I was pleased with what we got. It is true that there was a long wait for the unhelpful, unapologetic front desk, but the rooms were clean and the hotel amenities are nice. We liked the restaurant, the gift shop was a lifesaver in an unplanned stay like ours, and the hotel food quality was good for such a low price! The walls were thin enough that I could hear the t.v., faucets, and guests whistling/talking in the next room. That being said, maybe we lucked out, but even with a hotel full of children and wedding guests it was still surprisingly quiet at night. They put us on the 3rd floor, DIRECTLY above the night club and yet I couldn't hear any noise coming from there. Looking out the window, we could see an accident on the freeway (had to shut the blinds to keep out the flashing lights) and yet could never hear the sirens. Nor did the traffic from the very busy road outside the window create enough noise to bother us. We live in a quiet, rural area at home, so unlike some past reviewers we are not desensitized to city noise. Room service showed a lot of patience over the phone and did get our breakfast order correct despite english not being their first language. It's Miami, 66% of the population is Latino! The equally Hispanic restaurant staff also got our dinner order correct without any problem. However, I WAS a bit frustrated that they don't have a menu to look at when ordering room service. The hotel is in a convenient location. Several car rental places are nearby (one is directly across the street) and there is straightforward access to the turnpike and I-75. The hotel was unapologetic about it being after the hours of their mall shuttle service, but we were still able to walk to the mall very quickly. All and all, it was quiet enough, and a clean, convenient hotel to stay in. I feel we got our money's worth and would recommend it.

<Content>Shuttle the worst I stayed at the Howard Johnson hotel during the thanksgiving in November 2006. My most recent stay was April 2007. THE SHUTTLE SERVICE IS THE WORST!! In November, I had to wait 21/2 hours for the shuttle (no apologies). I decided that I will stay again in April, thinking the service would improve WELL, the shuttle never came, my friends and i arived 6.35pm and waited for the shuttle until close to 9.00pm. Imagine the SHUTTLE NEVER CAME! I called the hotel because the shuttle should be coming every hour. The front desk agent said the shuttle is on its way. Ever hour we called , the agent told us the shuttle was on its way. I arrived at the hotel fuming. Imagine the supervisor offtered no compensation. I asked him who was the shuttle driver, he pointed to a man who was doing bellhop duties. Some of the people are nice in the hotel, however be prepared to spend money for a taxi to the howard johnson.

<Content>Depends on what your looking for..... I stay at this hotel often at least a week a month (have too for business reasons), the rooms are adequate but refrain from staying here at weekends, they do not have enough staff it seems ever so expect lines on checkin and no help with baggage! They have a spanishstyle disco on site until 5am in the morning which keeps everyone awake up to the 5th floor so if your hoping for some peace forget it unless your high up. During the evenings at weekends the hotel is frequented by unsavoury charecters often drunk and disorderly so if you have children I wouldn't advise staying here.The front desk staff are unpleasant and constantly have errors with my bookings despite presenting them with evidence of the confirmation. The food at this hotel is basic and ok but you are not allowed to take food to go 'Hotel Policy' which they only tell you after you pay. The service staff always get the orders wrong most cannot speak english correctly and you have to wait too long to get what you ordered.Taxi's do not like to come to this hotel so you then have to book their own transportation so if you are visiting on vacation I suggestcar hire.The telephones in the room beep annoyingly and flash it's supposed to indicate that you have a message but sometimes you do not and the phone continues to beep and flash which requires maintanance to fix??? This has happened to me at least 5 times at this hotel and while the phone is like this you will not recieve any incoming phone calls, I have missed many important calls because of this and have totake the phone off the hook in order to sleep. Do not expect a quick fix for anything at this hotel it normally takes 2 days. The beds come with sheets not duvet and are old, don't expect comfort.The decor is dated and carpets need total replacement. The good thingabout this hotel is the close proximity to the mall its only across the street and there is a 24hr walmart in walking distance. The pool is lovely but I never see anyone in it, there is no bar service while around the pool.There are no washing machines so expect to send clothes for cleaning and it is pricey. If I had a choice I would not choose this hotel.

<Content>Ok hotel, great for business travel Room was a bit outdated, but no major problems. We stayed over the weekend and had no problems from the salsa dancing noise or from the highway others have commented on. Though, I am from the city and am used to a little ambient noise.Breakfast was standard, but a nice bonus since it was enough to fill you up.

<Content>OK for one night we were booked in here by our travel agent pior to catching a cruise.After reading the reviews I was dreading going but it was not that bad.I asked for a quiet room and we got one at the back of the hotel but could see a 8 lane highway not far from the hotel, and no double glazing. A bit noisey but as we were prepared with ear plugs we got a decent night's sleep.Room was a bit worn but everything worked OK, it was clean, and the bed was huge (by european standards) Breakfast buffet in the morning was nothing special but you could fill up with as much as you wanted.As other reviews say it is definitely not an airport hotel. I think we paid $34 for a taxi which we shared with another couple - rather than waiting 45 mins for the shuttle.

<Content>Fool me Once Shame on you.. Fool me twice Shame on Me Let me start off this review by telling you that we went to this hotel back in 2005 and found it to be a hidden jewel in Miami, so when we were back in the area it was only natural to choose this hotel again. Boy were we mistaken!!The hotel itself hasn't changed. The hotel seemed clean and the rooms were your standard rooms. We booked the three rooms for February 19th. Upon arriving to the hotel we were greeted by a nice woman named Flor. She checked us in quickly and we made our way to our rooms. Two of the rooms were fine except the third room had the problem of the room's keys not working. We headed downstairs to see if they could fix the keys and was greeted by a woman who told us to wait until she was done cleaning off the counter before helping us. Finally after fixing the keys, or so we thought, she went back to cleaning. We went upstairs and the first key we tried didn't work, the second key opened the door to find that the room was already occupied. Thank goodness we are honest people because who knows what some people would have done in that situation. We headed back downstairs again, were the same woman who just handed us the keys looked at us like we were just checking in and not just down there with a problem. After telling her what we found she proceeded to give us another room, without apologizing nor finding out why she gave us a room that was already occupied. And to make matters worse one of the new key cards didn't work. This room was fine for the night. Let me repeat for the NIGHT. The next day we checked out and spent the day in Miami. About three hours before we were to head to the airport to fly home we received a call that our flight was canceled and would have to fly out the next morning. The cheapest rates in town, most likely because of the poor service, was the Howard Johnson. We called them to book two rooms for one more night and requested adjoining rooms. We went back to the hotel and waited 30 minutes to check in. When we checked in the lady at the front desk said that the hotel didn't have adjoining rooms, which was a lie because we were in a room with doors the connected to the next room just the night before. Not wanting to deal with their ignorance we went upstairs with our children ages 6 and 8, who were starving, to drop off our luggage and head out to eat. We opened one room and everything was fine. But low and behold when we entered into the second room the room was already occupied. We went downstairs furious and the woman said that the previous person staying in the room had checked out and that hotel cannot remove any possessions from the room until the owner comes to claim the items. Playing the devil's advocate I asked, You mean if they never come back to the room you will never have the room available? She looked at me as if she never thought of it that way and like a robot repeated. We cannot remove any items for the room. However, they can give a key to any body's room to rummage through their possessions if they choose. Anyway we asked her because their are not adjoining rooms in the hotel would we fit in the Penthouse. She said she has never been in the penthouse and doesn't know. We went upstairs and just a note. DON'T EVER BOOK THE PENTHOUSE. The only difference from the other rooms was they have a mini frig and a microwave. We went back downstairs and waiting 45 minutes before speaking to the woman again this time requesting a manager. We spoke with Danielle Torres, who just got done kissing some corporate woman's [--] because they messed up her room. She was so apologetic but when she went to help us she looked at us as if we were nothing. She reviewed the house keeping schedule and said that the room was clear when they checked it, as if we were lying about the room being occupied. She then proceeded to say that her staff was ignorant and not capable of doing their job. She gave us another room on the same floor and she said that was all she could do. After complaining she asked what we wanted from her. I told her that after all the aggravation the least she could do was discount our room. She said the room was already discounted with AAA and we already got a good rate $104.70 (with tax), but to show she was sorry she would discount our rooms by $10 each. At the end of my rope and knowing that the children were upstairs hungry I took the new keys and went upstairs. One of the couples we were with went into the new room and one member took a shower where he found a cockroach wandering around the bathroom. The next morning we checked out to find that Danielle never took off the $10 discount the rooms. We didn't notice until later but we only got the discount on one of the rooms not both as promised.Here is the real kicker. When we got home we found that we were billed for five nights on the first nights stay where we only had three rooms. We called the incompetent hotel and got no results so we had to call corporate to look into the matter. This hotel is not worth the price, nor the frustration unless you wanted to be treated like the lonely cockroach in the bathroom!!

<Content>the noise and the service is Horrible I stayed in this hotel from 03/31 to 04/02 for a conference held in FIU. I was thinking tha tby the price I paid per night, the hotel should be OK. I was wrong. When I arrived in the hotel around midnight after 6 hours of driving from Orlando, what was greeting me in the hotel lobby was blasting heavy bass salsa music and thye clerk behind the counter was asking me if I like LIVE music..... Our room was on the fifth floor so the music was not too bothersome. However, the hotel is right next to major highways and the all night traffic is loud enough for you to have nightmare. ...I have to get up early the next morning for the conference. When I finally came back at 10pm to my hotel, my card key did not work. I went to the lobby to find a line of at least 6 people in front of the counter with the same problem. When I finally got to talk to the only clerk behind the countr after waiting for 20 min., he said my card key was made only for one night despite I had a two night reservation...When I finally made it tomy room, loud noise from outside the windows made me think that the windows were open. But no, they were closed. The noise actually came from a party held in the parking lot of the hotel. A stage was set up and loud music was played by a DJ speaking only Spanish. The only thing I could understand was it's a LIVE broadcasting for some local station and it would go all the way to 3 am! I call the counter and the clerk said he would ask them to quite down. Well, it's a LIE. I tossed and turned all night. I turned o TV in order to blur the loud music so I could fall asleep but it failed. The music lasted way pass 3am when I finally fell asleep due to exhaustion. If you pay in order to have a good night rest, saty away from this hotel!

<Content>I won't stay again! I just stayed one night at this hotel. The experience was unpleasant. Here is a few facts:1. When checked in, the staff (male, about 38 years old) was plite but not friendly to us. He gave me a higher rate, saying that was the weekend rate but actually no weekday or weekend rate at all if you check out their web site. 2. The staff allocated a room on the 2nd flour to us. There was nothing until we came back in the evening, we found our room was just right on the top of disco! It was so huge noise and vibration from the disco that the room was shaking! We requested to change the room to higher flour and got approval immediately as the staff on duty at night (about 60 years old) didn't believe us could sleep in such a room.3. In-room internet outlet requires a cable to connect to your labtop computer. When we checked in, the young staff said we had to pay $10.- deposit. But actually every room has a cable already. 4. The younger staff even didn't willing to answer our simple question, i.g., How far West Key away from the hotel?Therefore we believe the younger staff intentionally made things difficult for us on purpose! It's really not easy to have a good rest in this hotel! My suggestion is DO NOT book this hotel!

<Content>ok for a night, but don`t expect much I`m not surprised to read so many bad reviews on this hotel. To mention the best thing first: our room wasn`t exciting but ok. BUT: lots of traffic noise which couldn`t be filtered by the windows and a more than annoying night club with extremely loud music all the night until early in the morning. We were in the 8th floor so I don`t want to imagine the noise level in 1st or 2nd floor... The folks at the reception were ok but some didn`t speak very well English (ok, neither I do). If you have a chance, avoid the restaurant because a) food is at best so-so and b) the waiters are something between plain unfriendly or nice but don`t understand much English.

<Content>Run Away The front desk experience was ok. The hallways were dingy and gross but our room was clean and nice. The elevators were in need of maintenance.It was nowhere near the airport (20 minute drive) and there was a party by the pool that went until at least 2 a.m. and the disco downstairs ran until 4 a.m. We were on a top floor and could still hear the music.We left at 4:30 a.m. to catch our plane and people were just leaving the disco, so it didn't feel to safe walking to the car. The neighbourhood was sketchy as well. For the money, you can find a more peaceful and enjoyable place somewhere else.

<Content>Beware Avoid this one if you can. Really unpleasant. Here麓s an example of occurances during my stay:Day 1 - The people at the front desk misplaced documents which had been sent to me previously, only after I insisted for the 3rd time they found it.Day 3 - A party with unbelievably loud music held at the hotel until 4:00am. Unable to sleep.Day 4 - I asked for the courtesy pick up van to pick me up at a nearby mall - it never showed up. So beware, this isn麓t a good place to stay.

<Content>Wish zero stars was an option Terrible stay here. Complimentary shuttle only runs every one and a half hours. Hotel is nowhere near Miami international airport. Hotel hosts very loud parties that start after 9 and are scheduled to run until 2am. The night we were there, the band did not quit until 4am. Staff refused to move us to another room, refushed to reduce the volume, refused to refund our charge so we could move to another hotel. Manager on duty said he had permission from the police to host parties and that the police did not care how loud it was. Hotel obviously is more interesed in money from hosting parties than money from return guests.Ashley

<Content>For a night It's a good value for a night (the place isn't very pleasant) not for several days.The hotel isn't very easy to find but breakfast is good and the room is quiet and clean.

<Content>room fine, ricky martin terrible we stayed the night before dec 11 cruise, the room and am breakfast were fine, however NEVER stay when there is going to be a nightclub evening, we asked for a quiet room and were given one above the pool where the DJ was set up, the noise was awful, a call to the desk proved no help, they were fully booked. the next morning no satisfaction was given. be aware.

<Content>Horrible Don't speak Spanish don't stay here. Staff are horrible, restaurant is worst I have been to in years. We escaped after one night of a 10 day stay.No visable management on 3 visits to the front desk...guess they are scared of their guests...and with good reason.

<Content>Not bad for the price Stayed here one night before our cruise January 8 2005. Room was clean and comfortable. Hallway's need updating. The shuttle was not running and so it did cost $30 for a cab. Front desk staff not very friendly or efficient. But still not a bad place for the money.

<Content>DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BOOKING THIS HOTEL Hotel Location and AmenitiesThe hotel is located right next to a freeway and therefore all rooms suffer quite badly from heavy traffic noise that goes on all night. The windows are inadequate to prevent this noise permeating the rooms. Amenities - Pool, adequate, but nothing to write home about. Restaurant, functioning on restricted hours with no room service after 10pm. If you're flight gets in after 9 and you don't have a car, your only option is to order a Domino's pizza.....really, I'm not kidding. Not even milk for tea is provided in the rooms, and if you ask, they just say no (that is, if the person you deal with speaks English, which most of them do, in Pidgeon fashion).Lobby - smells of dampness. Internet services provided at a charge. Carpet in the lobby and the corridors was so thin, you could feel the ridges in the concrete directly underneath. Rooms, clean but basic. Again, thing carpet. Again, the smell of dampness was prevalent. Poor quality drapes that don't close (presumably to save in costs on fabric?) but just hang at the side of the window. Television, microwave. Bathroom spotless. Bed reasonably comfortable. Staff. Unhelpful, often with a very basic mastery of English which makes communication difficult. Even when communication could be achieved, their attitude was extremely unhelpful. Having stayed here, I would not do so again. I'd rather pay the extra to stay elsewhere. Book only if you are blind, deaf, don't mind not eating or having even the most basic creature comforts and you actually enjoy being given bad service. All in all, not good value for money.

<Content>DO NOT STAY HERE old, run down, ill managed. pool with no water, balconies in PENTHOUSE rooms (just top floor rooms) with a view of parking lot and busy streets. Prepaid reservations were screwed up. Check in took an hour with no crowd. In bad part of town in old industrial area. You'll regret staying here.

<Content>Wonderful Experience This is a beautiful Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel. My room was nicely equipped, clean and new! I flew in to the Miami Airport and the property is just 10 minutes away. Our meeting at the hotel was catered and serviced superbly. Highly recommend!
