<Content>A pleasant stay :) I chose this hotel based on the previous postings, and everyone was right. My stay was fantastic!The hotel is conveniently located in the Waikiki area. The location was perfect for shopping which is something I desperately needed to do right before Christmas. Every place I wanted to go was within a walking distance or I was able to take a bus (there were several lines running) to the Ala Moana Shopping Center. The bus stop was located only 2 short blocks from the hotel.I had contemplated on renting a car, but because I knew I was going to stick around in the neighborhood, there really was no need. Plus the hotel parking costs $22/day and it's valet only although you can come and go as you please. If you want to park on the street, good luck because it's really hard to find a spot.There were two computer workstations in the lobby with a printer. Printing was complementary, and I was able to print my boarding pass there :) There was also wireless internet connection in the room. This was fast and reliable.Overall, the room was clean, quiet and comfortable. The fridge (with a small freezer space) was very useful. The only things I did not particularly like were the shampoo and conditioner. The texture of the liquid was kind of weird. They had a nice scent though.BTW the cab ride from the HNL airport is usually $35-40. However, a more economical option is to take the airport shuttle which was $9 one way or $15 round-trip. You can call the hotel and ask which shuttle company to use. (Sorry I don't remember which one I used). I believe there are a few, but certain shuttles have better service and are more reliable than others.The hotel staff was extremely helpful, prompt, polite and welcoming. Even prior to my arrival, I called the hotel like 8 times with an extensive list of questions each time, but I never experienced any rudeness from the staff. So if you have any questions, you should always call as you'll get a very thorough answer. In fact, most of the things I wrote above are what I learned from the hotel!

<Content>Ringing in the New Year The Best Western Coconut Waikiki is a GREAT place to stay in Honolulu. The location on Waikiki is fantastic. We were able to walk to the beach, restaurants and shops within a few minutes. We were really impressed with the hip decor at the Coconut as well as the cleanliness and modernity of the hotel. The staff was really nice and helpful as well. We live in Kailua but wanted to spend the night in town for New Year's Eve. It was a great place to stay to ring in the New Year!

<Content>From a travel agent This is absolutely one of the best hotels in Waikiki I stayed at so far.Rooms are spacious and very clean and provide all the amenities for a relaxing stay. I enjoyed the little kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, coffeemaker and they even provide plates and other utensils. The beds are very comfortable and the big flatscreen TV with lots of channels was just perfect during those few rainy days. OK the breakfast buffet is rather small but good enough to start the day. Computers with free internet access in the lobby are very convenient to check on email and attractions. Staff was always very friendly and helpful. The pool is small but who needs a pool in Hawaii? If you are looking for a clean hotel that provides just about everything you need for a wonderful vacation (including beach towels) this is it.

<Content>It was the perfect place for our soccer team We stayed at the Coconut Waikiki Hotel while playing in a week-long National Soccer Tournament . 14 fourteen year old soccer players and their families (and grandparents) converged on this newly renovated hotel and we all agreed it was the ideal place for us to stay. The friendly staff was informed, patient, and more than acommodating to our large group. The nicely furnished rooms were clean and comfortable with ample amenities. When there was a problem, it was quickly remedied (if you're a light sleeper, ask for a city-view room.) Every morning a generous continental breakfast awaited us in the bright and airy lobby along with access to two computers. I loved the bowl of apples on the counter. The driving and parking area is limited but the valets made it look simple with our 2 minivans and rental cars always ready when we needed them. The pool is small but when we weren't playing on the soccer fields we were at the beach a short 3 blocks away. We highly recommend the bar  restaurant Spada nearby. Mahalo from the Beverly Hills All Stars Soccer team to the wonderful staff at the Coconut Waikiki for your gracious hospitality. We enjoyed our stay with you and look forward to visiting again. Aloha.

<Content>Modern comfort The staff were welcoming and personable, from the moment we checked in until we checked out. The pictures don't lie. The contemporary design of the rooms are truly unique without sacrificing comfort and cleanliness. Slept like a baby everynight. The patio door could use a little more grease, but that's a minor nitpick. You might not get all the amenities and servicese that you would at one of the larger resort hotels, but there are things the other hotels don't offer, such as the manager's wii-ception. And the location in residential neighbourhood gives the Coconut a different vibe, but still convenient to everything in Waikiki - shopping, beaches, nightlife, restaurants. Also, be sure to make aquaintance with Bosley the Gorilla if you decide to stay.

<Content>Would stay here over and over again If you're looking for a reasonably priced, quiet, clean and friendly place to stay - look no further. The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful. The Aqua Coconut is a gem in the middle of a beautiful place to vacation. If you are looking for a fancy pool this is not the place to stay but then do you really go to Waikiki for a swimming pool? We loved our room and the beds really are as comfortable as everyone says. We never had a single bad experience during the 8 days (Nov.4-12) we were there. That includes the people, the beach, the restaurants and the car rental agency (Enterprise -an extra thank you) just down the street We loved the Cheesecake Factory for it's prices, quality of food and the fun we had sitting and people watching. Dukes was another restaurant we enjoyed many times. Sitting at Dukes for dinner and looking out over the ocean watching the sunset was a treat on it's own. We can not say enough good words to the Hawaiian people who we found without exception showed us hospitality that is hard to top. Mahalo to all of you in Wakiki and a special Mahalo to Jamal and the staff at the Aqua Coconut - I will forever be grateful for your consideration. If the fates permit it my wife and I will be back.

The Lobby and Reception area were well maintained, the friendliness and the eagerness of the staff was unbeatable. The decor of the room was very modern, reminiscent of a TV Redesign Show, complete with kitchenette.Continental Breakfast was a pleasant surprise and fresh coffee at any hour was a plus.I would return to the Coconut Waikiki most definitely.Great Job!

<Content>Beds were fantastic Stayed at the Best Western Coconut Waikiki for just two nights. The staff was most helpful and accomodating. The rooms were small but nice and clean and modern. The bed was one of the most comfortable my husband and I have ever slept on. A bit of a walk to the beach but doable especially with a stop just down the street for a great three dollar mai tai.

<Content>Terrific stay We were looking for a place to stay for a couple of nights before and after our cruise....I found this hotel which at the time was still undergoing renovations but was scheduled to open a couple of months before our arrival.I must saw we were pleasantly surprised to get a hotel only a short walk to Waikiki beach for such a reasonable price.To our further surprise the room was terrific ( the first one was a little more spacious but they both were well decorated)The beds were extremely comfortable and the the continental breakfast had much better fruit than even the cruise were went on!!Considering we spent 124.00 per night for a hotel room in Toronto beside the 401 highway before we left on our honeymoon getting this room in Hawaii no less for 100.00 a night was incredible by my standards.We will definitely stay there when we return in a few years to enjoy more of Hawaii's beauty

<Content>Excellent customer service It was an nicely furnished hotel with excellent customer service.Will especially like to take the time to compliment Lee Ann , the customer service officer that was on duty on the 10th of Nov (night shift). She was always polite and patient with the many requests that we had. On the last day, even though we had checked out, we went back to the hotel to wait for our shuttle. The shuttle was late. She took her own initiative to help us book for another shuttle, when she sense how worried we were. Both my husband and myself were impressed by her exceptional customer service. Thumbs up.

<Content>Comfy Coconut Got a good internet prepay rate on the hotel's website. The decor was modern and in sothing colors. Staff were friendly and helpful - made a good restaurant recommendation. Location was close to shopping and 3 blocks to the beach - close to international marketplace and just about any kind of shopping. Liked having a convenience store nearby. Room was very comfortable; bed was nice. The only thing I'd change is separate switch for the noisy bathroom fan. All the fixtures and furnishings are new - very nice looking. Big TV and having a small table and kitchenette was a big plus. I would stay here again if I come back to Waikiki - the staff and the bang for the buck makes the all difference.

<Content>Was quite happy Stayed 4 nights here and 1 night at the Wakiki Parc. Coconut was much cheaper and around the same quality. The location wasn't bad at all, althought it wasn't beach front. Its minutes from the beach, and close to a Kuhio Ave bus stop so its really convenient for going to a lot of places. And the renovations were good and the rooms were very clean. Staff were nice. The TV is massive.. and Yes there is free wifi in room.Minor problems were:- maybe this is a cultural problem but in every other country in the whole its normal to have a kettle for boiling water in hotels. However they did not have one in the entire hotel.- in lower levels facing Ala Wai there is a bit of noise, especial as some of the windows let in quite a bit of noise.- breakfast does not have much variety.- lift smells a bit funny

<Content>Completely renovated, excellent value We planned a last-minute weekend trip to Oahu from the Big Island and found the best price right on the bestwestern.com website. Using a tip from a review here, I knew to expect some confusion with finding the driveway into the hotel, especially since we arrived at 11 PM. No matter...we passed it anyway the first time. The entrance is, quite literally, the FIRST entrance off Ala Wai Blvd as you round the corner from Lewers. The signage is easy to see if you're already driving on Ala Wai, but coming off Lewers, it's confusing.Anyway, the lobby looks exactly as pictured in the photos. The front desk staff at that time of night were not extremely friendly...they were positively mainland-esque, if you ask me; not rude, just not very friendly. The day staff we worked with had much more aloha spirit.We booked a city-view room with a queen as the cheapest rate, since our time on the island was limited and we knew we'd just be using the room as a place to lie down. We were not offered an upgrade (no matter, just mentioning it for those who care).We got the smallest room on the floor, based on the emergency/fire exit maps that was posted near the elevator. But the room is clean and new and functional, and looks exactly as the photos show. We opened the lanai doors and got a great breeze. The city view is a view into the apartments right next to the hotel, a little bit of the Ala Wai canal and the rest of the town behind it. If we were staying any longer than just a few days, I would have far preferred the Diamond Head-view rooms.Breakfast is typical Continental-style, nothing fancy at all but does the trick if you're grabbing a quick bite before heading out. There are two computers in the lobby and two spots for hooking up your laptop. Valet parking at the time we went is $22/night.I can easily recommend this hotel for vacationers on a budget. It's not far from the action and is easy to get to (once you find the driveway!)

<Content>Memorable My boyfriend and I stayed at the Coconut Waikiki, and it's a kept secret. The first night we arrived we were given a room on the nosier side, we were told to check back the next morning in order to switch rooms we did, and since that moment everything was superb. The rooms were beautiful IKEA furnishings but still quaint, rooms were immaculate. The beds were extremely comfortable, slept like a baby every night and so did my boyfriend which for him is unusual. The rooms come with a safe where you keep the key and a flat screen huge T.V. The rooms are on the noisier side when you open the door so I would suggest recommending something higher up with a mountain view. The bathrooms are on the smaller side, so unless you are close with your traveler I would suggest you take turns using the space. Let's talk about the staff, extremely friendly and hospitable. They made our stay extra special and told us not to hesitate if we needed anything. We decided to cook two evenings out of our trip, and our decision to do so could not have been any smarter. It's a quiet area with a brand new barbecue, and the staff gave us whatever we were missing in order to make our meal more satisfying. So unless you are willing to spend money on a good restaurant that's worth eating at, I would recommend cooking. There are a lot of mediocre, down right disgusting places to eat, where they stand outside to get patrons in. Don't get me wrong, there are some great eats, just do your research before going. Back to the hotel, it's a few blocks away from the beach which was a disadvantaged however the advantage to this is you get to resort to a quiet, lo-key boutique hotel where you feel like you are right at home without the crowds. So if you are looking for a comfortable exquisitely clean hotel with staff that will throw you off your rocker, Aqua Coconut is your best pick. Good Luck!

We were pleasantly surprised as the property exceeded our expectations. Great value - truly, a gold nugget. From check-in to the decor, the Coconut offered a great stay!

All in all this is a great hotel and I was very happy with my choice. -Natalie

The rooms were very large, clean and cosy. We had a kitchenette if we decided to stay indoors and have dinner one night. There was a table and two chairs. A large plasma screen tv. Small but clean bathroom with an efficient shower. Nice soaps and schampoo bottles. The body lotion smelled lovely. Breakfast was served downstairs in the lobby with cereal, toast, danish, coffe and eggs.Overall good reviews - couldn't have picked a better hotel for our stay. We will return - shortly!!

<Content>Great hotel with great Staff After 5 days in hostels in Waikiki and Honolulu, I stayed for 2 nights at the Coconut Plaza (it was the Aqua when my stay occurred) I really enjoyed this hotel, mostly due to the fact that the staff was so attentive and friendly. There's a complimentary breakfast, and I was able to use a courtesy room to shower before my flight. My room had a great view of the Ala Wai Canal. While not on the beach, I think a lot of travellers put too much emphasis on needing to be beachfront in Waikiki. Waikiki is small and you can walk to the beach in a short time. I really enjoyed my stay here,

<Content>Best Boutique Hotel in Waikiki If you want to stay in a beautiful, classy, clean, well-managed small hotel in Waikiki this is the place for you. I spend two weeks out of every eight weeks in Hawaii (for business) and I've stayed in a lot of different places. For a small hotel, this is the best. The atmosphere is serene, the service is excellent, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the big screen Samsung TV in my room was sweet! Many hotels in Waikiki have spent a lot of dough to remodel their lobbies, but their rooms don't stack up. The Coconut has been renovated throughout - there are no unpleasant surprises. A nice continental breakfast and Internet access in the lobby make this place perfect. Check it out!

<Content>We were spoiled Hotel has been newly renovated, so everything was fresh and looked smart. The staff were always helpful and well informed. We were provided with anything we needed. We highly recommend the mountain view room. Don't chintz out. It is worth every penny. Waking up to the sunrise and mountains is gorgeous. Just be aware that the traffic on the street below never stops, so bring ear plugs! We found the pillows too fat and fluffy for our personal taste, and so went to Wal-mart to buy our own ($9 for 2) was worth it for our two week stay.Breakfast is the same every day (pastries, hb eggs, bananas oranges, juice, coffee, tea, cereal, toast), and could get boring after a long stay, but we added some pizazz by buying our own bread for toasting, and some peanut butter etc. So the simple continental is fine for the first few days, but if you're staying longer, be creative. Taking it to your room works nicely too.The pool is small, shaded, and cold. But hey, we were there for THE BEACH dude, so who needs a pool anyway.The Coconut is in a decent location; we were able to walk everywhere. Only 5 blocks to Waikiki. But we don't mind long walks. After seeing other hotels of comparable price, we were very happy with our choice.

<Content>Gem of a place We booked into the Aqua Coconut for one night to house us before we boarded our cruise ship. We are all delighted by the place. The reception area is clean, open and welcoming. The Guest Services staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The room itself was easy to find and as impressive as the lobby. It was clean, nicely decorated and furnished and had all the amenities (a microwave, a proper fridge that was not a mini-bar and a sink to wash dishes). We had a nice lanai with a couple of chairs. We were expecting the continental breakfast to be (after past experience) nothing more than some soggy croissants, weak coffee and sludge passing for orange juice: what we got was a feast of pastries, toast, cereals and fruits. It was within walking distance of Waikiki beach and all the main amenities (you are never far from an ABC store wherever you stay鈥?. If I had to find something amiss I would say that there was no safe in the room, the towels could have been a little bigger and taxis did not come to the door of the lobby, which meant an uphill climb with the luggage (or downhill trying to hold the luggage back). I would definitely go back and stay here.

Not just the staff has been very helpful and friendly, the whole place has been renovated clean and refreshing!It also has great huge TV, love the views and not too far from Waikiki beach. I would really like to thank for the special request room that you have accommodated me and my wife too.The only tiny thing that could be improved is that the fan in the bathroom and the air conditioning could be changed to a quieter ones... Apart from that, excellent hotel.Overall, I was very happy to stay there and strongly recommend it to others who is considering staying in Waikiki.ZP

<Content>Have a Coconut! We stayed at the Aqua Coconut on a business trip and what a jewel to find in Waikiki! This newly renovated boutique hotel is chic and classy, topped with a super friendly and personable staff. Because the hotel is located on the corner of Lewers and Ala Wai Blvd., the one-way entry driveway is a bit tricky. You have to approach via Lewers, which is one way, and then you have to turn a sharp left on Ala Wai to get into the driveway. Our first entry into the lobby popped our eyes with the apple green d茅cor that almost took us back to the 60鈥檚, but then it slowly brought us back to today with the stuffed lounge chairs and computer stations to be used at your convenience. Then the Front Desk staff welcomed with smiles and banters of fun and laughter.A circle theme throughout the hotel was carried in the fabric, wall treatments, furniture and pillows in the rooms, which we found to be very modern. Loved the huge flat screen TV, but warning鈥t competed with the awesome mountain view of the 鈥渙ther side鈥?of Honolulu. The bathroom was clean and calming with blue walls and brushed nickel trim. The beds were so comfortable and loved the pina colada welcome amenity presented in a coconut shell. The only areas for improvement are to have a desk in the room and the bed blocked the closet, making it inconvenient to get to.So many free things at this hotel, computer use, breakfast in the morning, fitness center and the Martini Mixer on Thursday s for all guests. It was also fun playing Wii games on the flat screen TV.I would go back for a personal trip to O鈥檃hu and stay at the Aqua Coconut. It鈥檚 a perfect place if you鈥檙e looking for a quaint place to stay with modern conveniences and personalized service to match.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Experience I stayed in the hotel recently with my girlfriend. The hotel is conveniently located, however a 10 min walk from the beach. The advantage is that you awoid the crowded main stream hotels. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Complimentary breakfast is OK but nothing extraordinary. It is a really nice, cosy, modern boutique hotel, recently refurbished. Room is not very big but well designed with modern furniture (a huge plazma TV).Ask in the reception for extra towels that you can take with you to the beach.You can enjoy complimentary wireless Internet connection in the entire hotel. In the lobby there a 2 modern computers with a printer that you can use as the courtesy of the house.In the lobby there is also a local Expert of Expedia that recommends and sells trips in Hawaii.Overall worth recommending.

<Content>Love the Aqua Coconuts As a hotel employee of 26 years on the island of Maui. I was so impressed by the hotel decor and great amenities. The staff has the ALOHA spirit which you dont find alot in Waikiki anymore. Alyssa, Kalani, Mike,  Crissy are very knowledgeable and always willing to help. I will stay only at the Aqua Coconuts when I go back to Waikiki. If you

<Content>Great Staff traffic noise UGH We stayed at the Aqua for 8 nights in August, the rooms were nice with a little funky layout. the beds were very nice. The free breakfast was very satisfying every day.Our only complaint was even on the ninth floor the traffic noise was very loud on occasion like trash morning!! The Staff was incredible, Larissa went out of her way to make us feel welcome.

<Content>Would visit again We had a wonderful 2 night stay at the Aqua Coconut. The newly remodled rooms are modern and comfortable and very clean. We were surprised at how comfortable the beds are. It was nice to have a mini kitchenette in our room with a fridge and microwave. The only issue we had with the room was that the patio door was older and difficult to open/shut.The location was nice too. Just 2 blocks to the strip it was very easy to get to where a lot of the main shopping and restaurants are.The staff was very friendly and accomodating, valet parking was quick and easy, breakfast was basic, and we didn't check out the pool on this trip.I would highly recommend it for the rate and would choose to stay there again.

<Content>Fabulous Our friends stayed at a similarly priced hotel and could not have been more dissapointed. I chose the Coconut.From the moment we walked into the lobby, we loved the Coconut. It has an atmosphere that lends itself to complete relaxation as well as trend setting. We were greeted by a very pleasant staff who quickly checked us into our room and checked to make sure we were comfortable.When we got to our room, we marveled at the creative and efficient use of space. Yes, that is to say the room was small, but it did not feel that way. The decor was fantastic in soothing hues of blue and green, and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. Personally, i have always found hotel linens to be substandard; not here. Forget the bathrobe, I wanted to take the entire bed ensemble home.Breakfast was great. Hardboiled eggs, danish, fresh fruit, juices and coffee. You will not be disappointed!!!We will certainly return.

<Content>Best hospitality ever I stayed at the Aqua coconut for about 2.5 weeks while I was at Tripler Army Hospital for work/vacation as a medical student and my family who had come to visit had stayed themselves there for about 1 week and I can honestly say that it was one of the best experiences in terms of lodging I ever had. The property is located in a prime location in Wakiki area cause it is just a stone's throw away from the beach and all the famous malls without all the added noise you would get otherwise but can walk everywhere from the area. The rooms are very comfortable and just perfect especially the comfortable bed which was the most important factor for me. My family said the room was on the smaller end but they thought it was no problem at all because we weren't holed up in our rooms cause ITS HAWAII!! The staff however is what really made the difference for the stay however due to their exceellent service and care. It was the first time I actually felt sad to leave the hotel cause I felt like I became friends with the staff there. I would have to leave the hotel every morning around 5 am for work and they would have my car ready for me every morning. Talk about excellent service and very professional staff.. Best hotel for the price by far (a bargain) and I would recommend it especially for any medical students that may get defered from Tripler lodging and have to find a new place to stay.

<Content>A great stay, renovation was great After much research and a quick change of hotels (I cancelled my other hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor, (and its a good thing as I went and saw the other place, rat hole would be an apt describer) and booked the Aqua Coconut Waikiki. And it was a good choice! Very nice and just off the Waikiki craziness but still close to everything, good value, small room but very nice and well used space (besides who goes to Hawaii for a luxury room??). But I would have to say the staff are the best draw to this hotel. VERY nice, helpful and friendly. Never had any wants with them on the job. I highly recommend this hotel to those wanting a good value.

<Author>Hello_Travelers
<Content>Great Place to Stay!! My family and extended family stayed at this hotel in mid-Aug 2008. We were in Waikiki for a wedding. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend this hotel. The staff (Larissa, Mike, Jay, LeeAnn, Crystal, our housekeeper, the guy who manned the continental breakfast, you the get the picture) were excellent! They made us feel welcome and accomodated any request we had. At first we had booked a queen room, but it was too small for us, so we requested a larger room and they upgraded us to a king bed room that was much larger. We needed to fit a crib in the room (which they provided) and the king bed room worked great. I think the queen size room is the smallest room in their hotel. The rooms with the double beds were the same size as the king.The continental breakfast was good. We enjoyed it every morning. Our group had a couple toddlers and their was food that would work for them (cereal, whole milk, hardboiled eggs, oatmeal, fruit) as well as stuff for the adults (juice, danishes, coffee, tea, etc).The location was close to everything. You could walk to the beach in less than 10 minutes. Shopping was very close by and there were lots of restaurants nearby as well.The only cons I could think of for this hotel were the $22 per day parking charge (nice that it is 24 hour access, but the price is still steep), the awkward driveway into the hotel, and the pool which was very small and not heated.Other things I liked about the hotel were the beach towels (nice to not have to bring our own) and the 24 hour access to free internet in the lobby (with a free printer which is great for printing out boarding passes), the free wi fi in the rooms, and the microwave and the mini-fridge in the rooms (great for families that are staying for a week like we did). Also, the hotel was just renovated, so everything was nice and new!Overall, we had a great stay at the Coconut Waikiki! Thanks!

<Content>Awesome After flying for 11 hours from New York City I was tired. When we arrived at the hotel I immediately became re-energized. The hotel is beautiful, I particularly enjoyed the warm welcoming colors. The staff were all friendly and accomodating. Once I did finally decide to go to sleep after exploring outside of the hotel (which is a walk away from the beach), I slept very comfortably. When I woke up I enjoyed sitting on the balcony enjoying the warm air (the view was of other buildings/not scenic). I had a wonderful experience at the Aqua Coconut Hotel. Oh yes, I forget the charger for my camera and when I called back three days later, I was informed that my charger had been found and would be returned to my home address.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great staff Our family booked three rooms for a one night stay at the Aqua Coconut Waikiki. If we hadn't already made prior arrangements for a condo, we would have loved to have stayed longer. They did a great job with the recent renovation. The look is fresh, modern, sleek and clean. Even the smallish bathroom is renovated to maximize the use of space and light so you feel like it's much larger than it actually is. The bed was probably the most comfortable I've slept in for awhile. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. They are all warm, friendly and helpful - from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff we encountered in the halls and elevators. They truly exemplify the spirit of Aloha.

<Content>Excellent choice Excellent stay for business. I traveled with a co-worker and stayed at the Coconut for four nights. I travel a moderate amount each year for work and pleasure.The Coconut is slightly off the beaten path, but by no means is it out of the way. It is easily within walking distance of all the tourist spots and beach in Waikiki.The rooms are newly renovated, very clean, and refreshingly modern. We each had one of the Executive Suites. Very well done. Not sure what mattress and linens the hotel uses, but it was in the top two best hotel beds I have ever slept in. I enjoyed sleeping here. The only two downsides were trouble with the in-room wireless (supposed to be resolved in August) and there was no desk. I would recommend the hotel find a suitable work surface in the Executive Suites -- there is certainly enough room.Far and away the highlight, however, was the staff. By far some of the nicest people we met in Hawaii. After the first two days the front desk team figured out our schedule and had our car waiting for us (valet parking only). We didn't have to ask. Everyone was helpful and friendly. Larissa was particularly helpful when we had a mixup with our bills. After we returned home we called up to get help with our bills and she made sure that we were taken care of -- we were.I would stay here with my family. The rates are great. The hotel is close to the beach. I was able to go for an early morning run around Diamond Head (6.5 miles). Work is work even if it is Hawaii. The Coconut was a great place to end the day during my stay.

The Pool is a bit of a Non-event .....Quite small ! By the Front reception....but didnt really matter cause the Beach Water was Clear and Beautiful.....The AQUA COCONUT is a modern Comfortable Hotel that I would recommend to anyone ......Reasonably priced and a Welcome place to come home to ......David and Mary-Therese ......Sydney Australia...Aug 2008...

The rooms were very clean with a nicely updated decor and 42inch flat screens! The staff was great from the front desk to the valet. Crystal really stood out and helped to make our trip most enjoyable.The items that could be upgraded are the continental breakfast, the size of the bathrooms, and patio night lighting. The pool is very small but who goes to Hawaii for the pool when you have the beach. I would stay here again.Danielle

The construction and refurbishment was just about finished, they were still moving things in and painting but there were no problems or annoyances with that.The rooms were really good, with really soft comfy beds and huge plasma TV's! The location is a quick walk to the beach and all the fantastic shopping. Its a really safe area we had no hesitation walking around at all hours! The staff were incredible- an expedia agent within the hotel was really helpful! They recommended good places to eat and shop. Overall it was fantastic and we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Chic Hotel!! Loved it!! I was really amazed with the Aqua Coconut. As a resident of Hawaii, I decided to look for a hotel for my birthday that was affordable and also cute and chic, but close to the bars and clubs that my friends wanted to go to. I was really amazed with the Aqua coconut. I have stayed at high end hotels such as the Kahala, Royal Hawaiian and Halekulani, which are all great hotels, but nothing close to the budget I wanted to spend. The Aqua Coconut was up to par with most high end hotels and a third of the price, they offer a valet service for 22 dollars a day which allows you to park your car and retrieve it 24 hours a day which was great because it's really difficult finding parking in waikiki. They are right on Lewers which is walking distance to some of the best bars and clubs on the island. They have a pool and fitness room with new equipment and computers in the lobby that allow you to access the internet for free 24 hours a day. The rooms are also not decorated with that cheesy hawaiian fabric and bamboo furniture you'll find in most budget hotels, but with a cute chic and funky vibe worthy of the approval of a top interior designer. I'm glad I found this gem in the middle of the jungle of waikiki hotels. Overall I would absolutely stay here again. The hotel is new and clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. I was impressed and I think all my friends were equally impressed, I will definitely be coming back soon!

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Staff My husband and 7 year old son and I just spent 14 days at the Coconut Waiki and we have nothing but great things to say about our stay. The Hotel is only 3 blocks to the beach and the walk is great as you get to stroll through the best parts of Waikiki and it is surrounded by all the dining and shops you could ever want. My son and I were able to enjoy long fun filled days at all the beaches while while my husband was working and we were all able to enjoy all the best that Waiki has to offer. The room was great and the colors are vibrant and cheery and the hotel feels very fresh. The staff is top notch even though it is a limited service hotel there is no limit to the great service. I loved the tour concierge that is set up in the lobby. They helped us when the desk was busy. We loved our bed as it was very comfy and our lanai had a beautiful view of the canal and the mountains. We look forward to returning and seeing all the wonderful people that work there who we now feel are more family. Cheers to Alvida, Jamal,Crystal, Mike, Roy, Larissa and all the others that made our stay so great! Thank you.

<Content>Nicely redone and reasonably priced I've just returned from a week's stay at the Aqua Coconut. It's been refurbished so the lobby and my room were in great condition. The staff was super friendly. Their pool, though small, was good for a quick dip. The hotel is conveniently located off Kuhio, close to the action without being subject to the noise of it. My only complaint is that internet access was not yet installed in the rooms so if that's important to you, you might want to confirm before you book.

<Content>Fantastic Customer Service and Knowledge of Oahu If you are looking for a hotel directly on the beach this may not be the place for you. If you are looking for a friendly staff, clean establishment, great prices and a hotel located in central Waikiki then this definitely is the place for you. The hotel is located about three blocks from the beach and the walk goes through some of the nicest parts of the downtown area. The hotel is nestled in a quiet location that allows quick recoveries anytime during the day which will allow you to maximize your time in Hawaii. The biggest perk of staying here is that friendly front desk staff. I would have to say all the staff were extremely helpful and customer service orientated. The two biggest stars of this hotel by far are Crystal and Jay. They have amazing knowledge of the islands culture, food and people. We based many of our trip plans directly off their reccomendations and it definitely paid dividends by resulting in fun adventures for my wife and I. The location also has ties to sister hotels that have amentities such as day spa which we took full advantage of. The hotel is newly renovated which gives you many modern comforts such as granite counter tops, pillow top mattresses and 42 inch LCD screen TVs. The only reason why this location was not excellent is the pool is a bit small and they could have provided better use of their front deck area. I would highly reccommend this hotel for the price.

<Content>Refreshing and Friendly My family recently spent 12 days at the Aqua Coconut Waikiki while in Oahu for a major soccer tournament. I cannot say enough about how friendly and accommodating the staff is. Kalani, Joe, Jay, Crystal, Leeane, Larissa, Mike and everyone else provided us maps and directions, recommendations, towels for the beach, early breakfast for the team, and enjoyable conversation. The hotel has been recently updated with fresh colors and a welcoming environment. I used the exercise room which was clean and bright. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the evening hours with friends. The beds were comfortable and we all slept well. The hotel is a short walk to the beach and shopping areas. We would definitely return to the Aqua Coconut again.

<Content>Aqua Coconut: the right choice for our family We recently stayed a week at the Aqua Coconut. It had just reopened after its renovation which is almost complete. We had two rooms since we were traveling with two adults and 4 teenagers. The staff went out of their way to make sure that we had adjoining rooms and had enough supplies for all of us. Everything was cheerful and newly painted. The bedding was above average in comfort and freshness. One of our rooms was overlooking the canal and the mountain view was very relaxing. Since we were on the 9th floor we slept with our balcony door open instead of using the air conditioning and woke up to the sunrise and gentle breeze. Some people might be bothered by the traffic noise from the street below but it was worth it to me to have the glass door open. The refrigerator and microwave really helped for quick lunches and left overs from restaurants. The continental breakfast provided was enough to get us going in the morning and also kept our costs down. Parking was valet only but they were very fast and willing to accommodate our schedule. It was great being right in the heart of Waikiki, being able to walk a few blocks to the main strip and to the beach. It wasn't a luxury resort right on the beach but it was above average in comfort and location for the price. The best part was the staff. They were always helpful and friendly and because it is a small setting they actually got to know us. I would gladly return.

<Content>Good value budget hotel Stayed here from 6/11 until 6/17.Good value for money , breakfast was adequate but got a little boring after the first three days.Room was small but very clean , housekeeping were very good as were all the staff especially Crystal on reception who helped us with lots of local knowledge.Not too far from the beach , about a 8-10 minute walk.A big plus for me was the free internet in the lobby , never had to wait long to use it.The pool area is a little spartan and could do with some sun loungers and tables.In summary if you are looking for a decent hotel at a reasonable price , look no futher.

<Content>Aqua Coconut, pretty nice I should think... We had a great time at the Aqua Coconut. The only downside was the A/C to our room was a bit lacking, but that is the only complaint I have. The staff was amazingly friendly, personable, and very helpful. The location is convenient, only a couple blocks from the main drag of Waikiki, so it is easy to enjoy the night life, and not worry about driving or paying a high cab fare. The rate was very reasonable... I would recomend it to anyone looking to have fun in town, or anyone really. It is a bit far from teh beach, but I am not so much a fan of the beach there in any case.

<Content>Aqua Coconut is Great for Teams and Indivuals We have just returned from a week at the Aqua Coconut after a 11 stay as part of a group taking part in a week long soccer trip. The hotel staff, facility and location were ideal for us and the soccer team. The hotel was newly renovated and was clean and comfortable. The hotel staff took every opportunity to make our staff pleasant and help the team. For example breakfast was setup at 5:30 am and team dinners and videos were held in the lobby. The teams agenda was given to the front desk and they prepared themselves for the coming and going. The staff all seemed to be empowered to help with the trip. Additionally small things like towels at the front desk were available and the gym equipment was all well setup. The hotel is well situated and only a few minutes walk to the beach and restaurant. Over the past 5 years this is the best hotel we have stayed at as a team. I highly recommend the Aqua Coconut to traveling teams and individuals.

<Content>What a relief to find such a great little hotel! As a seasoned traveler - travelled for six years three days a week - I have seen my fair share of hotels and I have very strong opinions about what constitutes an acceptable hotel. As I had never been to Hawaii, I was relying on trip advisor comments along with my budget restraints!. I was intrigued when I saw that the Coconut Waikiki was reopening after an extensive renovation on June 6 as I always check a hotel for its last renovation date. I was pleased to find not only a well cared for facility, but one that was visually pleasing, as I really like a modern decor. (I so often see hotels that look like they were put together with my grandmother's cast offs.) The art nouveau feel played into the whole Waikiki vibe, and if you are looking for a great buy and if you don't need an ocean view...the price and value can't be beat. I would definitely stay here again... I spent the first five days at a well known and very expensive hotel on the North Shore and loved that experience...but the Coconut was a perfect fit for what we were looking for in a downtown hotel. If you don't pick this hotel...at least stop by for a look - you will book it on your next trip! I just relooked at the pictures that they had posted on this site and though they are good they really don't do the rooms justice. They don't show the granite countertop in the kitchenettes as well as the stainless steel sinks, microwaves and refrigerators; the bathrooms - small but clean - all white; the very chic lobby and nice fitness facility. Loved they entire experience!

<Content>So So Stay at Coconut This was a cute hotel in Waikiki, the room was clean and the staff was ok, but you can tell it's a refurbished hotel. It looks new but feels old. The driveway is also super small, so you have to whiz around the corner and up it quickly. But overall and ok stay for one day and one night as we did...

<Content>Desperately needs renovating We made this hotel a one night stop on our way from Toronto prior to a Hawaiian cruise out of Honolul, and a trip to Australia.We had booked this hotel on suggestion from our travel agent, but were unable to book it at the end of our vacation 7 weeks later, so booked a sister hotel the Aqua Palms for that stay.We checked in late in the evening after flights from Toronto and Vancouver ( read very exhausted travellers). The entrance was difficult to find, so our taxi let us off at a semi-hidden pathway and we hiked our luggage up the hill to the door.The young girl on the desk was friendly but didn't have a lot of authority, so when we reached our king room and found it as 2 twins, there was apparently nothing she could do to change it as all the rooms were booked.That wouldn't have been too bad except that the room wasn't clean, the wallpaper in the bathroom was hanging in strips, the sink and shelving were rusty and the tiles were broken and dirty.The linens were threadbare and the kitchenette appeared about 30 years out of date.We gingerly got into bed and slept OK.We discovered in the morning the only good thing about the hotel was its good location and lovely views from our decrepit balcony.Needless to say, we were thrilled that on our return to Honolulu 7 weekslater, the Aqua Coconut had no room for us, so we had to stay at the Aqua Palms which was wonderful and cheaper!!!

<Content>Horrible Honeymoon! After reading reviews about the Coconut Plaza hotel we became interested in staying there because of the inexpensive price of $80 a night. My wife and I were on a budget but now i regret not spending $20 more per night to stay right next to Waikiki Beach and not have to walk 2 miles to get the the beach every day. We arrived very tired in Honolulu that morning and had to stay in the lobby for some hours and not allowed to close our eyes! The front staff was very rude and drunk hotel guests kept going in and out of the hotel in groups. Not a good atmosphere there at all. The pictures on the reviews make it seem like a paradise but it really is not. The chairs are black dirty and the cushions smell, the ceilling full of mold, the tiles in the room make your feet dirty, very noisy, bad smell in the sheets and pillows. Over all do not stay at the Coconut Plaza Hotel located on Lewers street. It was a bad decision that we could have enjoyed more staying elsewhere. The reviews given then were from mostly eldery couples. The only good thing were the Blueberry muffins which made up for a big part of the horrible stay.
