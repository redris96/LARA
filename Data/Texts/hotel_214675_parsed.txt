<Content>Maile Sky Court No Ka Oi My family stayed in the Maile Sky court this weekend for a company Christmas party. It was very nice being in Waikiki and the Maile Sky Court added to making it a wonderful stay. We had a mountain view, the room was clean and the employees were very sweet and full of aloha. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to feel comfortable without staying in a huge hotel where you have to walk forever to get to the front desk! The pool and soak pool looked very inviting but not enough time to jump in. Make Castle Resort hotels a place to stay! Mahalo.

<Content>Castle Maily Sky Court I stayed 1 week at this hotel from 12-19OCT.The hotel is quite good for the price. Rooms are large and all features goog views. Decor is a bit 80's.The hotel has a good outdoor pool and a good hot tub as well as lounge chairs outside.Staff is REALLY friendly and they helped me a lot.The location is quite okay. Located at the and of Kuhio Avenue, there is only one block to where the beachroad begins. There are several buses travelling along Kuhio to the beach.All in all I can easily recommend this hotel.

<Content>Better in 2009 I would not suggest booking the The Castle Maile Sky Court until next year. They are in the process of replacing the elevators, so in the 24 floor tower, only one of three was working and in the 42 floor towner, only two of four were working. This project is not going to be done until January.Also, there is no Internet in the rooms, only in the lobby. They have signed a contract with TimeWarner to put new cable to all the rooms that will provide Internet and HD Television. I don't know when this will be completed, so ask very specific questions like do you NOW have free Internet in the guest rooms?The staff was very accommodating, the restaurant was good and the location was close to the Convention Center and the Waikiki strip. They have a free muffin and beverage breakfast or a $4.00 discount at the restaurant, for any meal. With the discount the meals are priced reasonably.Ownership changed last October from Outrigger, who did not maintain the property well. The new Japanese owners have a lot of catching up to do.Another problem we had was our tools, about $2000 worth, were stolen out of the locked rental car, so don't leave any valuables in a car. The hotel security and police responses were quick, however they couldn't do much about it. We are checking to see if insurance will cover the loss.Hawaii was great!, We climbed Diamond Head two days before they closed it for a month to do improvements. We toured the USS Missouri Battleship and hiked into Waimea Falls. Nearby we enjoyed a wonderful dinner with a view of the sunset at Jamesons by the Sea.I would stay there again, after the improvements have been completed.

<Content>Strictly not for couples / honeymooners.. I stayed there in the hotel with my wife, our first trip to Hawaii after marriage.I booked through a popular airline' s vacation package just because of the low price, for which I had to repent later once I entered the room. Our room was in 12th floor. It was smelly and absolutely not looking pleasant. The bed spread was the cheapest which I've seen in my life, among all hotels visited.If you are lookin' for a hotel JUST to keep your luggages, go for it.. worth it! If you are going Hawaii to enjoy including your stay, avoid this hotel first. Please spend little more money and book a nice hotel.I really wanted to write so much of my bad experiences in the hotel but can't waste time on it.. lot of people here wrote a lot bad and good about it and it's totally true. Don't believe that it's bang for buck or the comment it's awesome.. That's all i can say!

<Content>Just a place to stay They were 'modernizing' the elevators while we were there so the wait for an elevator was quite often long. But easily remedied by using the stairs. The hotel was clean and the staff were nice. I booked through priceline so I couldn't cancel or I probably wouldn't have stayed here mainly because I brough my two sons and the only bed arrangements they have are 2 twins or 1 queen. But overall it's an ok hotel.

<Content>A good place to get some rest We stayed at the Maile Sky Court Hotel for a day, prior to catching a flight to the Big Island the next day. A basic and reasonably clean hotel. The furnishings (carpets, furniture) in the room are quite old but functioning. For the price we paid for, I would say it is reasonable. This hotel is ideal if the intention is just to catch up on sleep after a day out on the beaches of Waikiki.

<Content>*MAHALO* We'll be back soon!* What to say, it was so good experience.For my birthday we spent 1 week in waikiki, with my family (husband, daughter 6years old and I) we loved it!The room was ok, we had a small room with 2 small beds that we thought to have 2 big beds but everything was Ok, we are in holidays so no worries, be happy, we are in vacantion!!! We are from Tahiti- French Polynesia, we are simple!The price was good and breakfast included, every morning my daughter loved to go down to get our breakfast (1 cup of jus or coffee and 1 muffin) so excellent! we used the swimming pool, it was cold but my daughter liked it! but I did go because I'm so frizzzzin' and the weather this day was cloudy.C/I was ok, we came earlier at the hotel about 9am but the C/I was at 3pm, we went to the staduim and came back around 2pm, the room was clean.The only problem is the elevator, 2 were broken and to take elevator we have to wait long long time and it's always full and occupate by the housekeeping and the bell boys and the other is the parking it should be free for guest of the hotel.SO MAHALO Maile Sky Court for your service, thanks also the lady who clean our room everyday Katalina from phillipine, and she just lost her father feel sorry for her...Well, some of my friend are coming to Castle Maile Sky Court the end of this year, I gave the address...And we will be back soon!!See you and Mahalo again!

<Content>Good enough hotel for a place to sleep There was nothing fancy about this hotel but it served it's purpose well. A place to sleep while exploring Oahu. It was clean and the staff were helpful. Vit's Hawaiian Steakhouse at the hotel was good and was not overpriced. The only complaint about the hotel was the extremely slow elevators, but in the hotel's defense, there was work being done on the elevators. it is close enough to walk to downtown shopping and also a short walk to the beach. For the price, this is a good deal.

<Content>Horrible hotel Hated staying there! If I had had the money I would have left and book at any other Honolulu hotel; I am sure anything is better than Castle Maile. Even though our room was non-smoking it reeked of it; I had to call housekeeping for some deodorizing preparation, which made it a bit better. Carpets are so badly stained I never took my shoes off while standing. Walls haven't seen paint in a while. In our room the card entry system did not work, so we had to request a new set of cards every time we were going in. Elevators are terribly slow. There is not one single good thing I can say about this hotel. I would not choose it again even if they gave it for free.

<Content>Perfect spot If you are looking to stay in your room for the entire trip, do not stay here....on the other hand, if you are looking for a place to drop your bags, enjoy a quiet nights sleep, have a delicious breakfast and enjoy the hotel pool, then this is a GREAT spot. The price is right, its clean and comfortable and the air conditioners are COLD COLD COLD......its a good spot for a tourist if you're going to be in your room to change, and sleep which we did!....Thumbs UP

<Content>Heavenly Honolulu! Just returned from a wonderful week in Waikiki! I had won free return airfare so I booked this budget hotel through Expedia based on 2 criteria: location and breakfast included. I paid 68 CAD per night for one person. It was just perfect for me.I strongly recommend staying at the Castle Maile (prounounced my-lay) Sky Court hotel because it had everything that I was looking for on this particular trip. Keep in mind that I have stayed in no stars to 5 stars. I paid approx. $31 for the taxi ride from the airport to the Maile Sky Court.The hotel is situated within a 15 minute walk to the beach. Take the park (Fort DeRussy) for a pleasant walk. I'd say 3-4 blocks if I had to. The lobby has a wireless hotspot for laptop users, a pond with Koi fish, a couple of booking agents for various activities (I booked with the Pleasant office to go to the Polynesian Cultural Center on the North Shore for $83), only 2 computers for internet use for guests ($5.00 minimum), a shop, a pay phone, a house phone and there are restrooms (American for washroom, toilet, WC) on this ground floor.I did not use a bellhop because I had just carry-on bags.There are 6 elevators, 4 of which worked. One bank of elevators served certain floors like L, 2, 3, 26-44 and the other bank served the other floors. The elevators were slow to arrive once you pushed the call button!!!!! But the price was right. I had rm 3413. The elevator speed was on the slow side too once you were in them but the doors closed quickly unless you held down the open door button. I was soooo frustrated waiting for the elevators and then I decided, hey, I'm in Hawaii! Lighten up! So plan your elevator trips accordingly!The room had a mountain view, a comfortable queen size bed, a safe with electronic code, an iron and ironing board, a portable hairdryer, phone, TV, clock radio, coffee makerand complimentary coffee (one time use), 2 chairs, dresser/desk, bar fridge, just to name the most important things. The water pressure in the shower was good considering I was on the 34th floor.The outdoor swimming pool (on the small squarish side) is on the 5th floor along with a Jacuzzi (rectangular and spacious). Lots of lounge chairs around. There was a bar inside, close to the pool. It had TVs, pool tables, and happy hour specials. I got my $1.75 Mai tai there every afternoon but did not spend a lot of time in the bar because I was in Hawaii for the sunshine. Also on this floor was a beauty shop and washrooms. Laundromat was on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Parking available on 3rd floor as well. Ice machine on 3rd floor along with a couple of vending machines. Did not use any of these.Good maid service. No complaints.Adjacent to hotel on Kuhio Drive was Vit's Hawaiian Restaurant where I had breakfast everyday. The hotel price included continental breakfast BUT it consisted of a huge muffin and coffee which you would pick up just outside the hotel at a table set up from 7 - 9 a.m. OR you could use your breakfast coupon to get $4.00 US off any menu item at Vit's Restaurant which is what I chose to do. I recommend the Hawaiian breakfast which costs $9.50 US and includes 2 huge hunks of Hawaiian bread, fruit, fruit juice and coffee. So it comes to $5.76 with the breakfast coupon. Very convenient restaurant; I ate outside. It was very pleasant! Servers were very polite, friendly and attentive.In the vicinity of this hotel, you have an ABC store, a Whalers General Store, and then Chanel, Louis Vuitton, YSL, Gucci, Tiffany's, Coach, etc. A little further you have ALL kinds of restaurants and shops to choose from!!! EXCESS! But I loved it! Check out The Cheesecake Factory (expect long lines) and Senor Frog's and the California Pizza Kitchen. You might be given discount coupons on the street (Kalauaua Dr.) Lots of buskers too! Streets are crowded, lively at night.Choose the Castle Maile Sky Court and save $$$! Then you can spend that much more on excursions and dining and shopping! If you shop at the International Market Place, remember to haggle (bargain). Don't accept the first price!The beautiful sandy beach was close by and offered all kinds of water activities and one photographer had 8 parrots with which he could snap a photo of you for $20 and up. Snack bars and lifeguards are around and the water was fabulous! Some people wore aqua socks but the ground did not bother me. Bus stops are located conveniently near by and you pay $2 for one way. They'll get you to Pearl Harbor, Hanauma Bay, Diamondhead Crater, etc. You can book an airport shuttle for $10 US at reception too. Aloha!

<Content>Ok for the price. Not the best place to stay if you are looking for Romance We've been to Waikiki before, so we did not care about the place we were staying at. We just wanted a bed to crash onto after a busy day under the sun. Honestly, I am just giving a 3 stars to this hotel because of the money we saved. I would not give it this rating otherwise.The CONS:1-) I believe it is BADLY managed. They had fumigation of entire floors during the high season. Luckily, it was not on my room floor. Other people were not so lucky.2-) They have 6 elevators. 3 serving up to the 24th floor in one side, and 3 serving the 25th and upper in the other side. For both sides, 1 was broken. That meant 2 elevators serving each side. To make things worse, the housekeeping people were locking the elevators in the floors to load and unload their things. The elevator lobby was always packed with people waiting to go up. Once I forgot my wallet in the room. In the end, I spent 20 min to go up and get back down to the lobby. The elevator was killing!!! Again, BADLY managed.3-) Customer service is inconsistent. Sometimes excellent, sometimes OK, sometimes bad. Nobody answered when I pressed guest services on the phone. Other times, I felt the agents were not prepared to answer basic questions and perform basic tasks such as giving info to tourists. (I worked in a hotel for several years and I do know what i am talking about)4-) The bathroom tub was rusty and moldy. What can I say about it?5-) Housekeeping knocks at your door at 9 AM. Well, we were tired and wanted to sleep more. Who would wake up so early after a long day and some drinks? Not us... Did I mention it is BADLY managed?6-) Not only 3 blocks of the beach, but several blocks. About 12 blocks of the main attractions (international market, mall, brand stores, ect) So, be prepared to walk. (Not a big deal to us since we already knew about it before hand)The PROS:1-) Cheap. Saved me a lot of money compared to other hotels.2-) It is still in Waikiki.3-) Offers a free pseudo-continental breakfast everyday. It's too bad that it ends at 9 AM. Too early.4-) it has free internet at the lobby (at least that)5-) It was really cheap.In Summary:If you have time and money, stay somewhere else nicer and closer to the beach. If you have no money, but need a place to crash, stay there. You will save some bucks. Go prepared and with plans ready because if you are counting on the agents and almost non-existent internet to get information, you are screwed.Definitely, not for honeymooners or any sort of romantic getaways.

<Content>Terrible Room, Shabby Hotel The room smelled like heavy cheap perfume and there was a technician working in it when we opened the door. The window only opened about 6 inches so we never did get rid of the awful smell. The phone did not work which we reported when checking out, but all they did was apologize for it. The only good thing about the place is the large hot tub outside next to the stamp-size pool and a seedy bar in which three people hang out at any given time. This hotel is directly linked to the airport info desk so for travelers coming in with no reservation it is easy to book directly from baggage claim at the Honolulu airport. At 5:30 AM in the hotel lobby, a prostitute was looking for her Appointment. Would not stay there agian. The whole place is in desperate need of renovation. The eighth floor hall rug was duct-taped to the floor at the the elevators, only one of which seemed to work. Staff at front desk friendly, but not very helpful. One redeeming feature besides the hot tub, is the hotel is near a very good Thai restaurant.

<Content>Great price, location Booked the room online on their website. We stayed 6 days and I honestly cannot say much bad about it. Room was clean, roomy compared to others I have stayed at. Included complimentary continental breakfast or you can use $4 coupons at the restaurant downstairs. Nice perk! The price was excellent. Friendly staff. I wish they had had a microwave in the room but it was great to have a mini fridge. The pool is very small for the size of the hotel. They have a hot tub. Nice location! I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Maile Sky Court - Good Service and Amenities for the Price I wasn't expecting much other than a location close to Waikiki's beach, but was pleasantly surprised when I checked in to the hotel. I was provided a clean room with a nice view of the coast and found the bar and restaurant in the hotel to be very good. The staff is very friendly, particularly the bar's bartenders, and the guests are from all walks of life which can make even a short stay here pleasant and interesting. I was here only 2 days and made friends with the bartenders (Shauna Lee and Matt I believe) and some of the hotel guests. Overall it was a very nice stay for the price and location. Only complaint is that the elevator is ridiculously slow.

<Content>Basic, affordable accomodations in paradise I stayed at this hotel last year on a work trip, so I suppose I had a different mind set than if I had paid for the trip myself and was on vacation, but I enjoyed my stay. There's a nice rooftop hot tub and pool with pool chairs for enjoying the warm Hawaiian breeze. The elevator was a lot faster than I thought it would be, considering I stayed on the 23rd floor. The room was very basic, the bed not so comfortable. The lobby is open air and very nice. I think there was free wi-fi. The staff was very polite. There's parking adjacent to the hotel for an extra fee per day. The location was great. I walked to Waikiki Beach and all the shopping. There is a free trolley you can hop on within a couple of blocks that takes you to the big mall near by in Honolulu.

<Content>If you like mold you'll love this place! I've stayed in youth hostels in third world countries that were better than this place. I like moist cake, not a moist hotel room. If you need a cheap, centrally located hotel with no amenities and aren't bothered by things like a broken air conditioner, moldy lampshades and gross bedspreads then by all means stay here.

<Content>Geat Value for a Limited Budget After staying at Castle Maile Sky Court in early April 2008, I can honestly write this is not an expensive resort hotel with the amenities one would find, however, the hotel offers a basic, clean room that is priced extremely reasonable on Hotwire. This hotel is designed for the traveler who spends their time in the sun, shopping or dining at the excellent restaurants nearby. The rooms are small, but comfortable with a coffee maker and small refrigerator. This is a no-smoking hotel, too! Vit's Steak House on the premises offers good food at reasonable prices. The hotel staff is friendly and they are willing to provide assistance. They also have a travel desk if you need help figuring out where to go or what to see in Waikiki. The hotel sits on a fairly busy street, but what hotel doesn't in Waikiki? If you are looking for a bargain, don't plan to spend your trip in your room watching cable TV, or in the hotel's pool or spa, and you like the beach, the Castle Maile Sky Court is the perfect 2-star hotel!

<Content>Wouldn't stay here again... I guess for the cheap price, I got what I paid for. The room was dark and smelled like mildew. The carpet was dirty (I was afraid to walk around without shoes). The bathroom tub was rusty and moldy. The AC was fine and I didn't see any bugs which I was worried about. The elevators were slow and frequently full so I would have to wait until another came. The worst part was that they were fumigating some of the rooms for bugs while we were staying there. They just told people to cover up their food and lock away their valuables and be out of the room from 9am-4pm. Are you kidding me???The location was close to the shopping area and restaurants which was good. We basically tried to stay out of the hotel as much as possible and luckily we only spent 2 nights there.

<Content>Never again!!! We booked though yourvacationcenter.com... it was our honeymoon but we had a budget to stay under but it was not that small of a budget... the travel agent really sold us on this place even though we wanted to stay at RQ waikiki beach. so we took her word for it and accepted the room... when we got there it was about 4pm. they said that our room was not ready yet and wouldnt be for another hour and a half... mind you check in is supposed to be at 3pm. so my husband and i figured we'd go cruise waikiki for a little bit maybe go grab a bite to eat. 2 hours later we return to the hotel and eveything is supposedly set. we wait about 15 mins to get onto an elevator (which by the way was broken for the rest of our stay), we get to our room, only to find the maid still creaning and doing a halfa** job none the less...at this point we were too tired. we just sat in the room and waited. The room smelled very wet and musty, the AC barely worked so it was a bit humid in there. the bed had some stains on the sheet and so did the bath towels. when you try and get service they dont give it to you, but when you dont want it ( for example maid service) they come into your room anyway! I put up the do not disturb sign cause i never trust maid service especially not at cockroach hotels like that one, but regardless we found that while we were away one day a maid STILL entered our room and threw away papers that i have been saving since our first day there... i called the front desk PO'd and they did nothing to help the situation. so i have no clippings to put in our wedding journal.... at check out they had the never to ask me if i would like to book a future stay...

<Content>Its okay if you know what you are getting This hotel is BASIC, its like a 40 story motel 6 except they include nicer soap/shampoo and it has a bigger lobby. That said, it is in Waikiki so if you pay $100 its not bad (or less than $60 like me). I must say I got a great deal on this hotel with a package through a big Hawaii travel agency (intials; P.H.) but if I would have paid anywhere near the rack rate I would have felt burned.First this place is not near the beach, so expect a 5-10min walk to get there. Parking is $$ but I did manage to find free street parking my entire stay within a couple blocks.Rooms have a safe (charge), coffee (free first day only), newer mini-fridge in my room, iron/board, newer wall A/C and free wifi in the lobby. That is where the ammenaties stop. No blow-dryer.The room was VERY clean, carpet and bed where relatively new (but very economic). Furniture was very tired, 80s laminate with some chips/water stains and the 19 TV was older with poor reception. Bathroom was also very clean, new grout and no mold at all.Other reviews are right in that the rooms are very small and the elevators are slow, stopping at many floors each time and often 1 or 2 of the 3 that may go to your floors are broken.At the price I paid, this place may have gotten 4 stars for overall value if it were not for the elevator being slow/broken and the water preasure was very poor. Also the pool is small, like 20' by 20' at most.Also Vit's steakhouse on the ground floor didn't seem bad, the $3.98 sunrise breakfast did the job for 3 mornings in a row seeing as egg n' things down the street seems to outgrown its own reputation and priced itself out.

<Content>Very Basic, Average Hotel in Waikiki This hotel is situated about 15 - 20 minutes away from the Honolulu airport. It is a very basic, no frills hotel that caters to the budget minded travelers. If you are looking for a bargain AND a fantastic place to stay, then Castle Maile Sky Court is really not the hotel for you. However, if you are simply looking for a place to stay in an expensive town, then you may consider Castle Maile Sky Court and try to overlook some of its flaws.Parking: cost $18 a day, it may sound expensive but that's pretty much the going rate for parking at hotel lots in Oahu. You can also try your luck and find free street parking!Rooms: Very basic no fills decor. The bathroom faucet was leaky and the bathroom takes a while to drain. They do provide shampoo, conditioner, and soap. It didn't feel dirty, but it didn't necessary feel squeaky clean either...Front desk: Checking in was pretty quick - the staff at the front desk are pleasant enough. Checking out was pretty awful - we waited for 20 minutes even though there were 2 others in front of us. After that, the line extended to at least another 4 - 5 additional families waiting to check out, but they didn't try to increase more staffing to help... Elevators: yes, painfully slow. Despite the maximum 10 person occupancy, people still try to jam themselves in b/c they have been waiting for more than 5 minutes. Just be patient... your turn will come. :)Overall - this is a so-so hotel. Would I come here again? No. Would I recommend this place to friends who are tight on budget? Perhaps. The location is not too bad - right across from markets and walkable to the beaches and nearby restaurants. Just don't expect too much and you'll be just fine. It's Hawaii - so just relax...and enjoy the beauty of this place.

<Content>hated every minute!!! There were 3 of me and my friends staying one night and it was terrible! Checking in was okay! We were told of getting 2 queen size beds. Then when we went up to the room and we got a room that had 2 twin size beds. And the rooms were so small! I mean very small, I have never seen a small Hotel room before! You only had room to walk to your bed and bathroom...if you had two people in the room the other person would need to sit down while the other is walking to or from the restroom. So you can imagine the 3 of us! The decorating was in the 80's decorations still! And it made me feel like i'm in a time war zone of some sort! Just if your going to Hawaii to enjoy Hawaii do not go there! But if your going there to pick up some chics that are walking down Waikiki in their glass slipper...then it will be fine to do what u got to do and leave (if your wondering what I'm talking about, walk down waikiki at night and you will understand)!!! Get my point! Terrible stay!

<Content>Would Not Recommend Hot tub was always broken, I believe it worked the first day we were there, then one other night, but it was colder than the pool/ocean. Elevators were EXTREMELY SLOW, sometimes people had to wait 15+ minutes for an elevator. We stayed on the 9th floor and usually took the stairs, as we were afraid if the elevators did come to the lobby to take us up, we could easily get stuck in them. After staying a week, we asked if we could have a few extra hours in our room before checking out, we had a late flight, they weren't negotiable on that at all. Wireless internet was available only in the lobby, and like the elevators/hot tub, it rarely worked, and when it did work, it cut out constantly. Singing onto the internet every 30 seconds gets very annoying.We were supposed to have a kitchenette, but our room had a small fridge and coffe maker. The TV got about 15 channels, one channel played Adam Sandler's The Longest Yard 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which is great if you have no memory or are a huge Sandler fanI would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Lost Our Res. Maybe it's me, trying to budget travel. Booked a $79 room for one night the morning of my stay. Arrived that evening to find they had no knowledge of my reservation. No one answered the phone # that I had booked at. Room was very small w/ window AC that groaned all night. Not a place that I'd care to waste alot of my precious time on.Bill in NY

<Content>Wouldnt do it again. My family and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Maile sky court. Initial check in was ok with the front desk staff seemed aloof and we were not even offered bell hop service. We inquired into a roll-a-way bed and were told it would be $30 a day which seemed excessive. The room was extremely small, I'm talking european small and honestly, there was no place to put a roll-a-way if we had one. The bed was in poor shape, the furnishing sparse and well used. The bathroom was also small and the tub filled with water while showering and took a long time to drain. The swimming pool is freezing cold, the hot tub is nice. However, on our visit each time we went to the pool, we dealt with drunk locals who told other guests to try and report them as they are regulars at the bar and would not be asked to leave. On a good note, the elevators worked great for us and never waited more then a few minutes. The maid service is excellent and very friendly. They did a good job of working in such a well used facility. The beach is not far away, perhaps 10 minute walk at most and Vit's Hawaaian steakhouse down stairs has decent priced breakfast and lunch meals. In summary, I will not stay there again. Though the place was decently clean, it was very uncomfortable for my family. I also found charging to use your in room safe rather tacky.

<Content>Its OK, nothing more Stayed here as part of a cruise package. Only stayed here one night and that was enough. The rooms were decorated from late 70's-early 80's. The bed was like a taco and the shower drain didn't work so we had to wedge the shower sticky mat under the drain to let the water drain out. The elevators were extremely slow as everyone has noted. The room was quiet, the scenery was nice from our window and those were the major pluses. I would have been disappointed if we had a week long stay here. All and all, our stay was over before it began so the negatives were bearable. If you are staying here for a night or two or on a budget, I would recommend but if you are looking for a nicer room, keep looking.

<Content>It's OK We got a very good deal on this hotel, with air from SFO, through Pleasant Holidays. When we arrived we found the room to be pretty basic, but fairly clean. My wife did the routine bed bug search and, finding none, we settled in ( I've never really had much confidence in our bug detection abilities, but it makes us feel better). The first morning, I awoke early and saw a cockroach scurry under the dresser, but that was the only bad bug experience and I suspect roaches are found in a lot of Honolulu hotels. Still, cleanliness took a hit because of this .The location is excellent, only a couple of blocks from the beach through a nice park. Security was not a problem. The staff were friendly and the pool and hot tub were all right. There is a bar next to the pool which is kind of a dive, but with good happy hour prices and a nice restaurant attached to the lobby.If the price was real good, we would probably go back .

<Content>New Management: Bad Experiences! This hotel recently changed management. I reserved a room for friends through the new management's website...a good rate for Waikiki. But when we arrived, we had to wait more than 30 minutes for the reservations office to send the reservation information to the hotel. Why they couldn't check us in and resolve this issue later is beyond me. And why did it take so long because the reservation had been made and confirmed on their own website? No apology from management; we had to wait at the front desk. When we were finally allowed to check in and get keys, my friends found that their room had not been updated despite higher prices. Still had the late 80s decor. And, the bathroom had not been cleaned properly. We asked housekeeping to resolve the bathroom issue with no success. My friends checked out within an hour. Again, no apology from management. Clearly, we got what we paid for and learned that it's better to pay a little more and get better service and better (and cleaner) accommodations in Waikiki.

<Content>A pleasant stay it was It is always a pleasure to return to the Maile. It is in a convenient location in the Waikiki beach area. The employees are very courteous and helpful.The room was okay, basic with nice view of Ala Wai canal and the mountains.As a military retiree, it was convenient to go to the Hale Koa hotel and Fort DeRussy Chapel. There are also many shopping places within walking distance.The room was relatively smal - fine for a single traveler, though.They did have the bath amenities - shampoo, etc.There is a respectable restaurant adjacent to the hotel.

Staff were very friendly and helpful with where to go and where to eat. Within 10 minutes walk of Waikiki Beach, close to buses to all the major attractions. We ate at the TGI Friday most days (though apparently it is now closed)I dont know how much it has changed in the last two years, however i really enjoyed my stay.

<Content>for 65$ excellent value Booked a special internet rate of 65$ night plus tax for 3 nights 12/12 to 12/15/2007 and stayed in #4012 mountain view.The good:Location is close to all the bus transportation,--and good drop off and pick up site for airport shuttle.Free Wifi in the loby (not in the room)Free big safe in the room.If you are up in the top floors, even mtn view is dramatic.Very friendly staff.Mostly Japanese tourists stay here so that is a positive since they are not as loud and obtrusive as Americans.The bed was actually pretty comfortable.My bath and tub were very clean.The housekeeping staff were thorough.Free coffee and coffee maker, iron and hairdryerFree shampoo and body lotion.The bad:no wifi in the room. as everyone has noted, this hotel has the slowest elevators in waikiki.The towels are not the big fluffy ones you get at 5 star resorts but they give you plenty of the thin ones. (but you will need to bring a beach towel)The rooms are small. I would not stay here as a couple unless I was a starving student--this is not a honeymoon resort!The windows only open 6 inches.There is no lanai.There are 16 rooms on each floor and the walls are thin so you may hear other people.Conclusion:If you are looking for a budget hotel, you could do worsethan the maile sky court.This was an excellent value for a single traveler. The staff are fantastic, the bell hops are friendly, and there is even a business center where you can print your boarding pass for one dollar (if you are fast).Sleep:I actually slept better here than I have in much higher end properties. Maybe I was just lucky and the hotel may have not been that full during my stay.The higher you go up, the less street noise. So if you can get up on the 40th floor for 65/night, that seems like a great deal in waikiki.I never went to the pool area so I can not comment.In sum:If you want to stay in a high end resort on the beach, you need to spend at least 300/night. This is not the place to impress anyone or to spend your honeymoon. Trust me. Look elsewhere. Spend more and enjoy a premium experience.But if you are a solo traveler and not picky, this place can save you money. When not traveling with my wife, I may go back just because I liked the unpretensious vibe.

<Content>Not very clean Just came back from a 7-day stay at sky court. The location of the hotel is great but I have to say I was very disappointed with the cleanliness. I got bug bites - gross! from the bed.They did not clean our room, only gave us fresh towels (slightly stained). They charge you $1 if you want another coffee refill pack. we just used the one.I guess it could have been worse. We don't travel that much but when we do we want a bit of comfort - this is a vacation from home. But we bought a cheap package and should have know better.If I were 20 years old and wanted to hang at the beach all day this is the perfect place.

<Content>Fond memories are just memories My wife and I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court several years ago during an Oahu stay. Then the only complaint was slow elevators. This time, though the staff was as friendly as before, the housekeeping was poor, bedding uncomfortable and the slow elevator problem was compounded by some out of service.There used to be a TGI Friday's attached on the ground floor. It is now closed, due to re-open as a Steak House of some type.This hotel is no longer an Ohana property. Now managed by Castle, we have decided we won't be using this hotel for future stays.

But , if you are young and want to see Hawaii for the first time and will eb going out lots and meeting new people at teh beach, why oh why would you pay $200 for a room. Just stay here !!!

<Content>Ok for the Price I guess I shouldn't expect more than just a room in Honolulu when only paying $89 for a partial Ocean View. The room was small, the bathroom small, and the bed was a queen (a king would not fit). They did have air conditioning, and a nice staff. I never did go to the pool or the bar. The area was right where all the shopping is located and the street was quite. So if you are looking for a bargain then this is a good place, it reminded me of a small Motel 6.

<Content>Budget prices with small rooms and slow elevators Just returned from a 10 night stay at this Hotel in Waikiki. The positives of this hotel include nice and helpful staff, quiet rooms, clean rooms, very nice spa, and relatively good location. The elevators are the worst feature. They are extremely slow and hot with no fans or AC. For most of our stay at least one was not working and at times two of them. The rooms are very small with the hardest bed I have ever tried to sleep on. We bought an air mattress to put on top of the bed in order to sleep. We did enjoy our trip but wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Maile Sky Court- a great place to stay We were there for a convention and found the stay at this budget minded hotel to be very convenient and pleasantly comfortable. The hotel is in a very safe location and is a comfortable 0.5 miles walk to the beautiful and very functional Convention Center. It is also about the same distance to the beach. The staff at the Sky Court is very curteous and attended to our every request....even taking care of a squeak in the bathroom door hinge (thanks Robert). The room was small but very clean, quiet, and comfortable. On a return trip, I would definitely stay at the Ohana Maile Sky Court. Mahalo nui loa to the staff for making our stay so comfortable.

<Content>A Good, Budget Property I was pleasantly surprised with the level of good customer service I received during my stay. The room was well made up every day. Although the hotel is starting to show it's age, the rooms are clean even if they are basic. Clean linens-no nasty surprises anywhere. The way I saw it, the more I saved in a modest hotel, the more resources I had left for activities and future trips. Mind you, this is not a four star, but at the same time it is not the motel from Vacancy either. I enjoyed my stay. I could see the ocean from my 43rd story room. I felt safe and the staff was very accomodating. Stay here if you want to save money.

<Content>Value for $$ The hotel provided reasonable comfort and tranquility at a very reasonable price. The room (with own bathroom, no breakfast provided) may look small but is just nice to overnight stays. Every morning newspapers are delivered at the door step. No sea view (that's why it is much cheaper). One thing to take note is the lift is kind of obsolete, and you have to be patient for its arrival. Highly recommend those who seeks a little bit more than budget hostel but less luxury than starred hotel.

<Content>What a great deal! The room cost 69 dollars a night. In Honolulu, Hello? It was very nice. The staff was nice, the hotel was very clean. The room was small but hey, it was cheap. The only thing I had some issues with was the noise. I had an alcove room. I am guessing they took one room and made it into three cave like rooms when expanding the hotel. So whenever the person next to me tried their room pass key it sounded like someone was breaking into my room so i got woken up a few times. The first time it happened I got scared but then i got used to it. I found the rooms to be a bit noisy but not horrible. The maid was the nicest lady I ever had clean my room.Maybe if you stay here suggest a non alcove room and it might be better. The only bad thing is that there is no balcony. I scuba dive so that would have been very nice. None of my things dried out while I was there. There is a Fridays in the lobby and you are close to tons of good restaurants. Nicks Fish house is to die for! Pricey but worth it. There is even a Blimpies close by for the cheaper mind folks.There is also a good bakery down the street. This hotel is not that close tot he beach. It is a good walk so be forewarned. People with disabilities or who have trouble walking may not want to stay here if they want to go to the beach a lot. The bus stop is right outside the hotel so that is a plus! Tip- there is no coffee inthe rooms( or there wasn't when I was there) i have to have coffee in the morning. There is a coffee place right across the parking lot but it is expensive. I did not discover until my last day that across the street and down a corner is a gas station convenience store that has coffee and cappuccino very cheap.if you just want coffee and nothing fancy nor expensive go here. tips- get out of the city!!!The city is nothing compared to the rest of the island. Breathtaking! Take a nature tour with Ohana nature tours/walks, Hike the volcano, and you must go visit Kaulua/Linnekea beach. It is stunning and not crowed! When I went I was the only one on the beach. And of course you have to go to the North shore, See the surfers, turtles and the Poly cultural center. Enjjoy!!!!

<Content>Decent cheap place in Waikiki If you are looking for basic, rock bottom accommodations in Waikiki, you could do worse than the Ohana Maile Sky court. It's conveniently located to most of the shopping and dining in Waikiki, and not too far (about 4 blocks walk) from the beach. The rooms are adequate size and functional. Because this place is a skyscraper, you will need to use the elevators, and they could be better - i.e. more of them, and they could be faster. Parking was OK and fairly priced for Waikiki, and there were several decent restaurants nearby, including an excellent Thai place. It's a basic room, but as such, it's fine - just don't expect much in the way of luxury.

<Content>Issues with Security We found overall the hotel was much nicer than we expected- we chose this hotel as a result of a package and were uneasy because it was only 2 star. But as per the other reviews we did find the rooms and hotel overall were very clean. Also, a bonus was that it had free wireless which you could access from the nice open lobby.One big concern, however, should be the elevators..they are very slow so if you run into a problem and need security you could be waiting for a long time- which defeats the purpose of having security. We actually had a man try to break into our room so this is why we ran into a problem with security- that said we recommend that you ensure you use the deadbolt and latch on your door if you choose to stay here. We did end up leaving the hotel the next morning though b/c of this concern. Now instead of just wondering whether a two star is clean enough..another concern is that is it secure enough??Hope this helps-

<Content>Cheap and Basic We stayed at the Sky Court 2/7  2/8 (pro bowl week) and then moved on to the Aqua Waikiki Wave. We wanted to check out both hotels and we specifically wanted a cheap place the first night since we would be arriving late. I would definitely categorize the Sky Court as a budget hotel. We paid $95 per night (taxes/fees included) for a Standard room and booked via the internet. The reviews I read were all accurate. The rooms were small and neat in appearance. They had window air conditioners, refrigerator, complimentary use of the safe, and only a few TV channels. The bed spread and blanket were very old and dirty, so we just used the sheets. The staff was friendly and helpful and the location was good. I was relatively satisfied with our stay, however, I'm not sure if we would stay here again. The condition of the bedding really bothered me.

<Content>Basic, clean, bearable If you are looking for a good buget property that's a short walk to the beach and shopping, this is one worth considering. It lives up to its billing as Sky Tower at over 40+ floors. This is by no means a full service hotel, so if you need room service and white glove attention don't come here. If you are on your honeymoon, don't come here. If you are traveling frugally or with family and are just looking for a clean hotel with friendly service, then this should be just your place. Rooms are small and basic, yet clean and serviceable. The rooms are also equipped with safes and free wifi (not bad). There's a TGIFriday's next to the main lobby which is open late for that quick nightcap. Or they have a bar on the pool level (5th floor) that has $1.75 drinks at happy hour (best deal in the area). The pool is not Olympic size but it was clean. The heater was down at the time so it was ice cold. The jacuzzi next to it was the remedy. Large enough for at least 10 people with strong jets hit the spot. The staff was also friendly and accommodating.All in all not a bad experience if you are coming with the right expectations.

<Content>Don't Expect Paradise From the outside, the Ohana resembles every other hotel in the neighborhood. The inside however, is less predictable. When we checked in, we were given a room with a handicapped bathroom and requested another room. After a few conversations with different people, we were upgraded to a room with a kitchenette. Sounded nice, but the overall atmosphere was the same. The room had little ventilation, the bathroom had none (careful if you're the gaseous type). The size was medium to small, ideal for a couple at most. Location is not a big issue because most of the hotels are within walking distance to the action. The pool was the size of a big bath tub. You will spend lots of time waiting for the elevator, although they have an express elevator. Customer service was friendly. They charge you to park in their garage. Would I book here again? No, I'd search for something better, but it was good for the price.

Small, tiny room; small, hard beds; a broken fridge; a TV with only 3 channels and no remote; an alarm clock radio that would work only when you would press 'sleep (that was odd); rude maid (all other staff members were nice and even quite helpful) Oh and the elevator...i think i would have reached the 41st floor quicker if i took the stairs. Overall, i guess it was okay, i was there to relax on the beach and party so didn't spend much time in the room and If it wasn't for the cute bell boy, i probably would have checked out sooner

<Content>Smallest room ever This room was 14x11, seriously, I measured it. I've never stayed in a room that was less than 200 square feet! The bed was terrible; hard and lumpy. The bathtub was about three quarters the size of a regular tub. The only thing about the room that was nice was the view from the 35th floor. Other than that, this place is absolutely horrible and all the rumors are true. I think most Ohana Hotels are pretty bad, but this is by far, the worst in the chain. Oh, forgot to mention, they charge $18/night for parking. You're better off parking at the public garage down Kuhio for $10/night.

<Content>Most impressed Before departing from New Zealand for our 10 day holiday in Waikiki we read the reviews of this hotel and can quite honestly say we were a little worried.Much to our surprise we found it to be a great hotel our room was fairly large had a kitchenette was clean well maintained and serviced daily. We had a corner room on the 20th floor with great views of the town and ocean.The bathroom was on the small size with the shower over a low sided bath, provided was a rubber non slip mat which impressed me greatly as I have a slight mobility problem and this took away any fear of slipping when getting into the bath.The lifts that everyone complained about were not a problem our longest wait would have only been a couple of minutes. I suggest that if you want a great place to stay at an affordable cost then this is the place for you. Its location is great and bus stops are almost at your doorstep and there are heaps of good eating places very handy.

<Content>Much better than expected! I'm very surprised to read all the negative reviews for the Ohana Maile, but here's my take on it:Pros:- Cheap, and we got a free upgrade for a room with a kitchenette. Personally I don't think this is an upgrade worth paying for, but having a fridge and microwave was nice!- Staff were friendly and addressed all our issues quickly and efficiently. Also provided follow up phone calls to check if issues have been resolved to our satisfaction. If we need shuttles, etc. they were really efficient in organising it!- Clean. Rooms cleaned every day, towels changed every day. Linen was clean. Bathroom was clean. No problems there.- View: there is a view if you're into that sort of thing. Personally, I couldn't care less about a view because I enjoy spending my time outdoors!- Close to everything: The trolleys, buses, shops, and beach is sooo close. To those who said the beach was about 15 minutes away - more like 10, which is good enough for me!Cons:- No ventilation. The room smelled like stale seawater (translation: pee). I'm surprised noone has mentioned the smell! After some time, you don't notice it but it's not pleasant. I think this is due to the lack of fresh air (you could only open the windows a couple of inches). But on the bright side, there was airconditioning.- Lifts: Everyone's had a whine about the lifts but they weren't too bad. The longest I waited for was about 3 minutes, but my issue was with my keycard with didn't really work. I wasted a lot of time trying to activate my keycard / room door! For the price I paid, I was impressed!

<Content>No problems at all at Maile sky court My wife and i booked this hotel thru NWA vacation packages, and we read all about the Maile sky court on here before we left, not aware of the great time that was ahead of us.The worst part of the hotel was getting there, dont take a taxi, it was 40 dollars from honolulu intl. to the maile sky court, instead take one of the shuttles for 9 dollars each, much better way to go.The hotel itself was great, and after reading of all the problems on here of the elevators and jacuzzi's, we found both to be spot on.We never waited more then a few minutes for any of the 3 lifts that were on our side of the hotel, the other 2 lifts went to higher floors, we were on the 17th floor, and yes the room was alittle small, and i would compare it to a motel 6 type of room, with a small bathroom, really for only 1 person at a time, also the furnishing were few, and out dated, but you know what! who cares really about these, we only slept in the room, and we spent all our time out in the beaches, and restaurants of the area.If you go out the right hand side of the hotel, walk up to Keo's for breakfast, or continue up the street to Eggs and things, there was a 45 minute wait there, and so we went back to Keo's and glad we did,It is only 1 block right of the hotel, and had a great breakfast.The beach was only 10 minute walk straight ahead thru a park like area, and it drops you off at a public beach, where you can go left or right to the hotels area.On Friday nights at 7:30 sharp there are fireworks at the hotel to the right, as you go to the beach thru the park, There are all kinds of ABC stores around, like 2 per block and is a lcal joke of there being so many, and you can really find anything you want there almost, we bought wooden place mats to lie on in the beach areas for only $1.69 each.Tons of great restaurants on the main strip that Ohana is on as well, also there is another main strip 1 block up from Ohana, Highlight of the trip was walking behind the hotel 1 block to the canal and having the wife spot a 10 pound puffer fish swimming near shore, it is also just a nice walk along the canal by yourselfs, with very little people, not unlike the 2 main strips, which were packed.We had absolutly no problems with the hote, rooms, or staff at all.The staff were very helpful, both at the info booth, and the front desk.The info booth guy did try to sell me a timeshare presentation but a firm no, and do you have a map please, welded a great response from him.Also must say, that we have never had a hotter shower then here, the water was HOT instantly, and never seemed to run out.We checked out the pool and hot tub area, and both were working great and the hot tub was HOT, the pool was a bit on the small side, but i never used it anyway, preferring to go for a swim in the ocean.I wouldnt go to the bar there though, it seemed to be a locals kind of a place, and really stank like a bar, like really old beer and old smokes.It was on the 5th floor and there were a few people that looked like locals in there.You only need to use your key to go up in the elevators not down, hence how they got there i guess.Would recommend this hotel for everyone, and would come back in a heartbeat.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For.. And Less. This is a cheap hotel, which is exactly what I was looking for. I was in Honolulu to look for a home -- not sun and sand. I needed a kitchenette. I paid for a kitchenette. I got a microwave -- hardly a kitchenette. I paid $15 extra each day for a microwave. I could have purchased my own microwave for half that price. The bar was gross -- but great drink specials. The jacuzzi did not work for two weeks. (Per the note on the door.) The internet service is twice the price of that 3 blocks away. The elevators worked, at times. Information desk people were not knowledgeable. One reservation desk staff person was R-U-D-E.Other than that, it was fine and exactly what I expected... A high-rise Motel 6.

<Content>Huge Views, Tiny Room I booked a standard room but upon arrival requested an upgrade to oceanview. Much to my surprise, I was quoted only ten dollars extra! We entered our room on the top floor (44), to find a tiny room w/ one small bed but a fabulous view of the city  ocean. We made do since nothing else was available for a few days. We then upgraded again to a kitchenette, which had two beds, on the same floor for $30 extra. Still, under $100 so well worth it if just for the view. The hotel staff are very friendly  helpful, the hotel itself is a bit tattered, beds are basic  probably could use replacing but after sightseeing all day it wasn't a big issue. Large jacuzzi (which wasn't working during our stay), smallish pool. Don't bother eating at the TGIF Fridays adjacent to the hotel, over-priced at night  breakfast/service were awful. Ask for directions to Eggs  Things, just down the street a few blocks, great breakfasts, always busy, so arrive early  expect to wait to be seated. For the money, you can't beat the Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki. Reasonably priced (especially before 5 p.m.)  everything is delicious!The city bus is a good deal ($2, $1 senior/disabled) if you don't mind the bus. Some of the bus drivers were very entertaining. Pick up route maps for free at any ABC convienence store, or a more informative version from the hotel.I highly recommend taking a few hours out of your stay to attend a timeshare presentation if you have the patience. Remember to ask to be compensated for your taxi to  from where you're staying, they'll pay you $10 in cash! We were awarded a free breakfast, rental car for three days, the token box of macadamia nuts  a future 2 night 3 day trip to San Francisco. I did run into a bit of confusion while trying to rent the car but it worked out fine  only cost me $30 for three days. Parking is a big problem  expensive everywhere in the city. $15 a day at the hotel if it's not filled up, but I did find out we could park at other Outrigger properties on the same pass without having to pay again. This came in very handy if one wants to go downtown.I highly recommend renting a car  exploring the rest of Oahu, avoid the tourist traps, get out of the city!

<Content>Good price for the location We stayed there from 11/9/06 to 11/13/06. Our room smelt mildew when we first arrived. Then we made sure the shower curtain was opened and air dried everyday. The smell reduced to almost not noticeable. The bathroom was kind of small. The room size was reasonable. The bed was comfortable. We got a good view to the canal. At peak time, such as 8-10 AM and 5-8 PM, the elevators could take forever to come. The staff even blocked one elevator to deliver towels/supplies everyday in the afternoon peak time. It made the situation worse. The parking lot is very small. Don't expect to find a parking space if you come back late, e.g. 9 PM. When we were there, the jacuzzi was broken. It only provided cold water! The location of the hotel is good. It is not too far from the main street  Waikiki. For the price  location, it is not a bad choice.

<Content>Great hotel for the money!! We stayed at the Sky Court in Aug 06 and it was a great overall experience. The price was unbeatable (~$49 a night) and only about a 10 minute to the heart of Waikiki. We've been to Oahu several times and this hotel was a lot better than the previous higher star hotels at a fraction of the price. Pros - Great price, clean and comfortable rooms for 2 people, quiet area since it is located at the end of the strip (right behind NikeTown and Gucci), lots of nearby street parking (just be patient and read what days/hrs they do the street cleaning because your car will get towed!!), very helpful and friendly hotel staff, Dollar Rent a Car and several restaurants and fast food places located within blocks of the hotel.Cons - The pool is tiny and not really worth going to when you've got Waikiki Beach a few minutes away, the shower/tub didn't drain very well but then again what hotel shower/tub drains very wellIn summary, if you're on a budget and just need a clean, quiet place to stay in a pretty good location then this is the hotel for you.

<Content>Very Pleased This hotel is an excellent value. After reading some of these reviews I was somewhat apprehensive about our travel agents choice but must admit she new what she was talking about. The room was clean, quiet and air conditioned with a view of Waikiki, the beach and Diamond Head. Our room had a kitchenette with a small fridge, microwave and sink and was stocked with a coffee maker, plates, cups  silverware.We found the service to be excellent. The staff was professional and kind. Upon arrival we noticed the fridge wasn鈥檛 cold so called the front desk, left for the day and returned to a cold fridge and a note telling us of the service call. Never experienced more than a 3-4 minute wait for the elevators. You must use your room key to operate the elevator and there was a bit of confusion among guests figuring out how to do that their first time.The location is excellent. Bus stops are close with most buses running up and down Kuhio. The Food Pantry (grocery store) is a short bus ride away and there you鈥檒l find fresh mangoes and anything else you need for meals in your room. There is a car rental 1 block away. The beach is a lovely stroll across a park which takes you past the post office so why not mail your post cards on the way.For those with Military affiliation the Hale Koa Hotel is a block away making it convenient to use the gym, the exchange (best prices on souvenirs and groceries) and enjoy the restaurants but you are required to show proof of military eligibility.We would stay here again without hesitation.

<Content>Great for the price We loved our stay at the Ohana Maile Sky Court. For US$89 a night we got a clean and relatively spacious air conditioned room with a bar fridge, bath and shower. Because it is a huge hotel, many of the rooms (including ours) have a view of Waikiki beach and the city. The service was friendly, personable and helpful. In contrast to some of the other reviewers, we had no problem with the lifts.The reason it is cheaper than other Waikiki hotels is that it is a 15 minute walk from the beach and the carpet is old. Neither of these factors bothered us in the slightest. Don't bother going to the hotel pool. It is tiny and in the shade most of the time. The hotel bar also looked like a bit of a dive, but if cheap drinks are what you are after, it could be worth investigating!

<Content>Nothing to complain about here! My husband and I recently went to Hawaii for our wedding. We choose the Sky Court because we did not want to spend a lot of money on accommodations. We were expecting You get what you pay for but when we arrived we were more then happy with our accommodations. The staff was VERY friendly! We booked our reservation on priceline and they got messed up so they did everything they could to fix our problem. The elevators were sometimes a bit slow but your on vacation, why the need to rush? The rooms had a kitchenette which was a plus and also a great view. There is also a TGI Fridays downstairs which made having breakfast convenient. The location was great, within walking distance to the beach, and also shopping. When we return to Hawaii would definitely consider staying here again!

<Content>Decent Hotel for a bargain Went to HNL last week and stayed at the Ohana Maile for 5 days along Kuhio.. was pleasantly surprised at the location as it was walking distance to the nice malls and beach. Our room was clean and they changed the towels regarly and the bathroom was clean too. Nice view of the city from our room at the 18th. The concern of the elevators too slow did not bother us as the longest we have to wait for one was 30 seconds. Central location and very accessible to the beach.For its price (we got it for about 60bux a pop), will definitly recommend Ohana for those travellers who want a decent place but at an affordable Oahu price.

<Content>Average hotel fairly priced My husband and I attended a conference in July and stayed 9 nights at the Sky Court. We did get a very good package price from Expedia so we were willing to overlook any minor problems we might encounter. I had read many reviews about problems with the elevators. The only problem we encountered was the touchy system requiring your room key to be swiped when going up to your room. We did not find the elevators to be extremely slow as has been posted in numerous other reviews. The room itself was extremely small and we had no view or balcony. We didn't intend to be in the room much so we made the best of it. The bathroom was about the size of a closet. Housekeeping was fine. The bar by the pool was fun and had a good happy hour with cheap drinks. The TGI Fridays downstairs was convenient for breakfast and late-night snacks. The activities people in the lobby were very helpful for planning things to see and do. Parking was rather expensive ($15/day) and tight. Location was good... within walking distance to the convention center, the beach, shopping, and restaurants. Overall, the Sky Court is an average hotel that is fairly priced for what it is. We are planning another trip to Honolulu next year and will be taking our children so we will be staying at a hotel with larger rooms that can accomodate our family next time, but for the budget traveler who just needs a clean place to shower and sleep, Sky Court is fine.

<Content>Nice for the price Upon arrival I was welcomed with a friendly Aloha. Upon check inI asked about the different rooms, I was given 2 keys and told to select which room I wanted, one would be a upgrade. I looked at both rooms, for the small upgrade charge I choose the Oceanview kitchenette Suite, it is twice the size as the regular kitchenett. My room had a great view of Diamond Head Mountain, the beach and the cities on the mountain.Hotel is close to shopping, restaurants. Walking distance to beach is about a 10 minute walk. TGI Fridays in located in this hotel. Prices are high, but use those coupons in the little coupon book, found everywhere in the lobby, new stands etc..I would definetly stay here again, friendly staff, nice littel hotel to the price, It's not the Sheraton, but is clean to sleep.

<Content>Absolutely fine!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Skycourt from the 9th to the 23rd July. We were slightly anxious at first because we knew it was a budget hotel however, we had nothing to worry about. The rooms are not small, they are an adequate size - and after all, you're in Hawaii, the room is merely a place to sleep!!! The bathroom was clean and the shower was nice and powerful. Our room was also serviced every day. Many people have mentioned a problem with the elevators, again we found no problem here - nothing a little patience wouldn't solve! The staff were very friendly, the front desk staff happily helped me when we accidentally lost our room key! The staff at the information desk are also very friendly, they always said hi and asked how our day had been, they were also very informative about the island and how to get around. The outrigger activities desk is a great way to organise trips to things like Pearl Harbour and again our assistant, Glen, was friendly and helpful. We travelled through 4 airports, on 3 planes for 18 hours over a distance of some 8,000 miles, I would be more than happy to do this again if I were staying at the Skycourt! As for Oahu itself - awesome! Make sure you visit Lanakai Beach - its off the beaten track but totally worth it! Also, the Cheesecake Factory is a must, order the steak!!!!

There was one that was breaking down all the time.Overall, this is a good place to stay for a quick visit, or if you're on a budget. It is clean and in a good location.If I ever went back to Hawaii, however, I would stay somewhere a bit more luxurious.

<Content>Look elsewhere I stayed at the Maile Sky Court at the beginning of July for 3 nights - my son and daughter and I were moved to the Sky Court after another Ohana hotel was overbooked. We were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite which was very spacious. However, the hotel was noisy at all hours of the night. The walls are very thin, and I could hear people staggering around in the corridors and cursing loudly at 3 and 4 in the morning. The long waits for the elevators were also extremely frustrating. One of the 3 elevators that services floors 26 - 42 was out of service during our entire stay, and it was not uncommon to have 50 people standing in the lobby waiting 10 minutes for the other 2 elevators. We eventually started taking the elevators that service the lower floors, and taking the stairs for the rest of the way.The Maile Sky Court was adequate for the price we paid, but there are nicer budget hotels to be found.Later in our stay, we went to another two star hotel in Waikiki, the Marc Suites, and had a much more quiet, comfortable and pleasant stay.

<Content>Good place if you get a good price. We stayed here 4 nights in July and after reading all the reviews here got just about what we expected, which was a cheap but decent room in an older and slightly run down hotel. In fact, overall we felt that it was a little better than expected and a great deal considering that we had a $69 rate ($79 with taxes). I'd definitely stay here again for a similar rate, but not for anything over $85 or $90 maximum. While most of the reviews that I read here were pretty accurate, I do have some additional comments. For example, the elevators were slightly annoying, but not nearly as slow as I had been expecting. The pool was awful, even worse than I had expected. It wasn't even worth going to. The desk staff was usually very friendly and polite. The parking fee of $15 might be average for the area, but I still thought it was too high. The room itself started out bad (they put us in a smoking room even though I had requested non-smoking), but after one night they moved us to a much cleaner and nicer non-smoking room. The bed was not great, but acceptable. The location is very good; just minutes walking to the beach, shopping areas, and restaurants. There was a post office right down the street which made mailing gifts home a breeze (check out the Priority Mail fixed price box which costs only $8.10 for whatever you can stuff inside to anywhere in the U.S.) So again, for the price, it was a great stay and I'd go back again. If you're a budget traveller and can get a good rate, this place is for you. Save your money for the other islands where cheap hotels are much harder to find.An important note: I booked the room on Travelocity because the lowest rate when I called the Ohana reservations number was $130. I asked if they'd match the Travelocity price and they wouldn't, so it was a no-brainer. Other hotels guarantee that they will offer or match the lowest price, but not Ohana, so I suggest checking many travel sites before booking.

<Content>Below average accommodation. My wife and Daughter (16 months) and I stayed for 7 nights at the Ohana Maile Skycourt in mid July, mainly due to all other(affordable) hotels being booked out then.I would describe the hotel as barely adequate. We paid $119 per night plus tax (around $135/night) for a tiny room with a queen bed. We asked for a bassinet but it was unsuitable (sort of 50's style steel tube). So first couple of nights had little sleep. I finally spoke to the manager, who was very obliging and arranged for another single mattress at no extra charge (front desk quoted an extra $20/day for foldaway bed).Although the room was almost adequate, it compares badly to other hotels. Straight opposite us was the Ambassador Hotel which looked much nicer. The morning after we arrived I went to the Ambassador in an attempt to change hotels, but they were full. Their rate was $63/night standard and $73/night kitchenette, for a much bigger room and a balcony to boot! (no balcony at Maile Skycourt). Also their swimming pool was much bigger and nicer.Finally, despite reading several reviews praising the friendly frontdesk staff, I found them rather unfriendly. Despite the three of us passing through the lobby 2 or 3 times daily for 1 week, we never managed to make eye contact with any of the front desk staff, and certainly received no greeting from them. Even checking out at the end of our vacation was about as impersonal as the checkout at Walmart.My recommendation is; try somewhere else.

<Content>elevator horror me and husband stayed there for 6 days, the first 2 days one of the elevator broke, and the next day the other one broke too.. it was horrible because we have to be in line just to get in the elevetor... there are some people who got trap on of the elevetor also and rescued after 40 mins. i talk to one of the person trap there and said it was boiling hot.. it was summer that time... 40 mins? to get help? thats just sick. we were at the 35th floor, it was a nice view, but the elevetor is the issue here, we have to wait like 5-10 mins just to use the elevator. the people were nice, the room was clean, but dont expect to be like a 5star hotel room, cuz its not. its just like a ordinary motel room.. oh and the parking, for guest you have to pay $15 good for 24 hours. theres no complimentary parking space. i recommend to just look for a parking space along the streets its free... enjoy!

<Content>Mahalo Ohana Maile Sky Court :) ! Here's the deal - if you're on a budget but are looking for a 4-star equivalent hotel, as some people seem to be, keep looking (and good luck!). If you're looking for a nice, cheerful place to sleep and chill out when you're tired for all the activities Oahu has to offer, Ohana is an awesome value. I was very satisifed with the overall experience! Yes, the room is small, but more than adequate for two average-sized people. My best friend's cousin even hung out w/ us a couple of afternoons, and all three of us napped comfortably (she in one of the twin beds, my friend and I on the other.) The housekeepers were very sweet and did a good job of cleaning the rooms. Ah, and I loved the showers - usually, the water pressure sucks in regular hotel, but it was perfect here.Hehe... the infamous elevator. It really wasn't bad. I only had a problem w/ one my last night, when it decided I needed to see the rest of the floors before I left (we stayed on the 8th floor) and took me allll the way to the 24th floor! Oh well - what was the point of getting mad? C'mon, you're in Hawaii, after all! :D The land of the 'chaka' - hang loose!I can see how the TGI Friday's downstairs would be convenient for some people, but I didn't go myself. Why go somewhere I can go to any day on the mainland? Instead, try Ono's Hawaiian Food in Kapahulu (from the Ohana, take the No. 13 bus in the direction of Diamond Head) or Kakaako Kitchen in the Ward Center (the No. 19 bus towards Pearl City will take you there.) Both places are local, cheap and SO good! And for dessert, don't forget malasadas @ Leonard's Bakery in Kapahulu, a couple of blocks past Ono's - YUM!Last but not least, the staff at the Ohana are awesome and SO helpful - they answered all questions we had about the bus, and the best way to get to certain places, etc., always with a smile. All this for only about $30 a night (great package deal from Expedia). :)Mahalo to everyone @ the Ohana Maile Sky Court for making our first trip to Hawaii so wonderful!!!!!- Magda

<Content>You get what you pay for!!!! We stayed on the 19th floor. The elevator requires you to swipe your hotel key to go up to your room and it's a very touchy system you have to swipe it right otherwise it won't work - very annoying! Coming down the elevators is no problem as you don't need to use your room key. Room was neat in appearance but rundown and in need of a major remodeling job! Outdated! There was rust in the bathroom by the sink. Bed bugs - blood on sheets!!! Eventhough the room was cleaned everyday didn't seem to make a difference - the bugs where still there! Been back 2 days and still itching from the nasty bugs! Next time I'll pay more and stay elswhere in Honolulu! Hotel staff were nice. Hawaiian Airline check in station in the lobby is very helpful. I know this is a budget hotel however I've stayed at much better ones in the past! We booked this hotel based on mostly positive reviews from travelers on this site. They either overlooked many details or these details didn't bother them. We also booked a budget hotel because we only slept at the hotel (we didn't even use the pool onsite) as we spent our days full of various acitivities and got back close to midnight every night. We will not stay here again and will pay more next time for a nicer hotel!

<Content>Not worth a nickel. First, I should point out that we bid for this hotel on Priceline. Although I had a good idea I would land at the Ohana, I figured it was worth a shot. I only needed a one night's stay.The only thing impressive about the Ohana was the fact that it's outside appearance, and even that was only because of its size. Upon entry, you could see the real I was traveling with my wife and three kids, and usually we fit comfortably into a room with double beds. However, despite the Ohana's size, the claimed not to have a room with double beds. Instead, they put us in a room with a queen size bed. I wasn't that worried, until I saw the size of the room.The room, at best, was 12 feet by 14 feet. It was by far, the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. It certainly wasn't large enough to accomodate my family comfortable. My kids ended up sleeping on the floors since it was impossible to squeeze a rollaway bed into the room. The furniture was cheap, there was no good view, and the mini-fridge wasn't cold enough to keep a candy bar from melting.I certainly made a mistake on this booking, don't make the same mistake. Find another hotel, and if you're bidding on priceline, don't settle for a 2 star in Honolulu.

<Content>Adequate, quirky hotel I've stayed twice at the Sky Court to attend the NFL Pro Bowl in February '04 and '06. I enjoyed both stays. The room rates are among the most reasonable in Waikiki. Front desk staff and concierge are always helpful and friendly. Couple of quirky issues are the slow elevators (not nearly as bad as have been previously chronicled), thin walls, and the occasional transgender (?) prostitutes that ply their trade in the lobby area. I've asked for rooms on the lowest floor possible to mitigate the elevator concern, but this has never been an issue for me. When in Hawaii, I usually don't stay in the room much, but when I was here, I heard people and their activities in adjoining rooms. Minor inconvenience that was helped with some foam earplugs. I didn't have a rental car or visit the pool area on either visit, so can't help you there. TGIFridays in the hotel lobby is fine for happy hour drinks and appetizers, but their main entrees are very disappointing. Don't waste your dining dollars here, as there are so many excellent options nearby. One of my personal favorites: Duke's Waikiki on Kalakaua. The Sky Court is also favorably located near most of the major city bus lines and world-class shopping venues. Aloha.

<Content>Great Bargain I recently stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court for 6 nights May 19-25. I love the hotel location on the west end of Waikiki. It was much quieter and less crowded than my previous stays mid-Waikiki. At check-in, I was given a room on the 41st Floor. After reading earlier reviews of elevator wait times, I was a bit alarmed BUT I did not experience any long waits for elevators. For safety, there is a guard stationed in the lobby by the elevators. Also, you must insert your room key in the elevator to access all floors which is another security feature and made me feel much safer.Air conditioning was by window units and worked very well which is important to me.I loved the availability of the laundry facility.I made a request to housekeeping to have my room made each morning between 9am-11am and they happily fulfilled my request. The biz center is 2 high speed internet computers and a printer. I had a problem one night with logging in after sliding my credit card thru the card reader for payment; the tech department returned my call within 5 minutes and gave me 30 minutes of complimentary use as an apology for the problem.There is a TGI Fridays in the lobby of the hotel which is convenient and stays open until 3am. For late night food, it was wonderful.Unrelated to my wonderful hotel experience, I did have a PROBLEM WITH THRIFTY RENT A CAR. I was charged for a full tank of gas even though the tank was not full when I picked up the car. I will no longer be using Thrifty for car rentals in the future.

<Content>Great spot... good value! We stayed for 3 nights at the Sky Court (May 27-30, 2006). Got a great deal through Travelocity and were very pleased with the hotel. We found the front-desk staff to be very friendly and courteous. The location was great - only 10 minute walk to the beach, and an easy walk to all Waikiki attractions. The rooms were good too - very clean. The decor is a bit dated, but everything worked just fine. For what you pay at this property, I think it's a great value, and money well spent. I will return.

<Content>I would stay there again! My husband and I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court hotel in early May. We had a great trip. The room was small but clean and the housekeeping staff was very nice. Checking in/out was quick and easy! The only negative feedback I can give is about the elevators. I know this has been mentioned in a few other reviews but they were very slow. I have to say we took the stairs the majority of the time. Thankfully we were only on the 7th floor! And if you rent a car, the parking spaces are REALLY small. We usually had to pull out and then load or unload. But all in all it was a very nice stay and we鈥檒l definitely stay there again!!

<Content>Amazing Experience We booked the hotel for an amazing $58/night with some vigilant web surfing for deals,. We also requested a higher floor when we booked and ended up with a room on the 38th floor :)The staff that assisted check in was wonderfully welcoming room and our room was ready right at 3:00. When we checked in, although the room was very small, it was extremely clean. The pillows were very comfortable and although I had read otherwise, the beds were not that bad (we weren't picky after rising early and exploring Oahu all day). We never had a problem with the elevator (patience is a virtue) and found that going up and down to the 38th floor was suprisingly quick for such a large budget hotel. Each time I had a new question the staff was willing to answer or make calls, whatever was necessary to help us. The view from our room was amazing. Although it was standard we could see the Ala Wai canal and the mountains behind. I wish the window had opened more, however, for $58 I can't complain !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is busy and just wants a clean place to sleep with helpful staff.

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful If you want budget accommodation in Waikiki that is clean, not a long walk to the beach this is just fine. We only stayed a couple of nights on the way to another island. The room is small but we were out most of the time, so not an issue. Had no problems with the lifts, never had to wait long. Got a high floor which gave great views of Waikiki at night and enough ocean to make us feel like we were on holiday! It was clean, no bugs and helpful staff.

<Content>Better than expected..... I went to Waikiki for a wedding and needed a cheap place to stay that was close to all of the fun. The Sky Court gave my husband and I just that. The rooms are a bit on the small side and the decor be updated by a few decades, but the price and the fact that the room was clean made up for it. I initially booked a kitchenette with a queen bed through yahoo travel. However, when we got to the room it had 2 twin beds! My husband and I are newleyweds......we didn't like that too much! I asked at front desk and they tried to change it...but they were completely sold out. She explained to me that the internet company puts in a request for that particular room. We switched rooms on our third night though. Because of this, I would suggest that you book directly through the hotel. The location of the hotel was convenient to all of the fun in the area, and our room was quiet at night to get a good night's sleep. Random Things: Elevators are slow at times; parking is $15 a day.We would stay here again.

<Content>Good Value My impressions of Maile Sky Court.The room was a bit on the small side but was more than adequate. Very clean and tidy. The maids are sweethearts and are very friendly.The hotel is centrally located to any place you would want to get to. Many nice restaurants within a 3 minute walk from the hotel. The beach is a 5 minute walk away.The pool is small but the hot tub whirl pool is very large. The deck area is very large, and there will never be a problem getting a deck lounger. It's true you might have to move your deck chairs around to keep out of the shadows as the day progresses, but only if you start in the wrong place. There is a very large area where you will get the sun the entire day without ever moving.The pool bar is cozy. Drinks are very reasonable, but they don't serve any kind of food except for chips. Two of the three bartenders are a tad moody and don't seem too happy to be there but overall a nice place.They also have two computers downstairs to access the internet for a fee. A bit expensive but there are other internet cafes close also that are cheaper.The only complaint i had was the elevators and the key access cards. Very good idea for security but a bit cumbersome to use. You couldn't go up to your floor without using the card to activate the keypad. A couple of times i had to take the elevator up to the top floor because i couldn't get the card accepted and wasn't able to punch in my floor # untill on the way back down. I wasn't the only one with that problem and it was a running joke for anyone getting on the elevator.Overall i give it a thumbs up. Good price for a clean hotel centrally located to everything.

<Content>great for budget travelers This hotel was well beyond what I thought it would be for a small budget minded person...My wife and I expected a run down hotel with not much to go with it..but we were pleasantly surprised... The room was very nice with a refrigeraor...color tv with remote.. hair dryer...etc... Although small the bathroom was quite nice. The rooms were kept very clean and the free morning newspaper was an added bonus. The staff was very helpful and security was great.. The wife and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary here and we were quite happy with everything... no complaints from us..THANKS !!

<Content>Great Value for Budget Travellers We were after a budget holiday but wanted to enjoy a famous location. After reading the reveiws we weren't sure we shouldn't have paid extra for better accomodation. However the Ohana Sky Court exceeded our expectations. We didn't have to wait long for lifts, the happy hour was extended and we were within walking distance to beaches, shops and resturants. This was a good thing as the meals are HUGE and we liked walking off the extra calories. I highly recommend this hotel. We are from Australia and thoroughly enjoyed our trip.

<Content>Good for budget traveler This hotel is great if you are on a budget and want to see Hawaii. The rooms are very small, enough room for 2 twin beds and a table in between, but not much more. The room does have a fridge. The bathroom is also very small. However, everything was very clean and manageable. In Hawaii, you hardly spend anytime in the hotel anyway. The elevators do take forever and the property is a good 5 blocks from the beach. With a package deal through Expedia or Pleasant Holidays, you could really save a lot by staying here.

<Content>We had a pleasant stay Like a lot of other people, we read reviews from others who had stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court before we left. All I have to say is, don't believe everything you read. Some people will make it sound worse than it is. We read that the elevators are slow. It wasn't bad at all. I have lived in a condo with an elevator that was a lot worse. The window did only open 4 and since the window was pretty low it's probably a good idea. If the window opened all the way, I'd be nervous standing close to it considering we were on the 23rd floor. The pool and jacuzzi were small but it was adequate for a quick soak if you don't feel like walking to the beach. The room was small but we found that it was sufficient for two people. It is an older hotel and could use some upgrading but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. We knew we were only going to be there to shower and sleep so it didn't bother us. The TV signal was not the greatest, we had problems with the outlet in the washroom once in awhile when we tried to plug in the hair dryer, and the bed was a queen size but you could actually feel the springs. We read about bed bugs but I didn't see any. Overall, everything was tolerable. I do have good memories from this hotel but I think next time we'll spend a little more and stay at a place that is a little nicer and closer to the beach. For what we paid I think it's good value for your money. For anyone who is looking for a hotel in this price range, I highly recommend it. The bad experiences you read about I'm sure are isolated incidences.To also mention, the front desk clerks were friendly, the cleaning lady was really nice, and the people at the information desk were more than helpful.

<Content>Beware of the extra costs The hotel itself was OK. The rooms were small, but at least they were clean. We booked a package with an on-line service that included both hotel and flight, so we got a good deal on the hotel. But, beware of the additional costs. Not only do you have to pay $15/day for parking in a garage that is always full, they also charge $2/day for coffee packets in the room and $3/day for use of the in-room safe. The parking attendant messed up our parking pass and tried to charge me an additional $15 when I checked out. However, I talked to the manager of the hotel and she straigtened everything out. They did accommodate our request for a late check-out, but that also costs us an additional $50. It was OK for a value hotel. I will probably stay somewhere else if I ever go back to Honolulu. If you decide to stay at this hotel, just beware of all the extra charges that can add up fast.

<Content>Ok . . . I guess Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Ohana Maile Sky Court. Unfortunately we were there during the 42 days of rain and the beach closures because of the sewer main break.Pros: Location - very close to several dining options. There is a TGI Fridays in the lobby of the hotel and a couple of good restaurants on the surrounding blocks. It's also close to Waikiki Beach, the Honolulu Zoo, the Waikiki Aquarium, the DFS Galleria (shopping mall), and some ABC Stores (similar to Walgreens/CVS Pharmacy). Good housekeeping - they really cleaned up the rooms.Views(sometimes) - the high floors give the view of other buildings, but sometimes you get lucky and can see the ocean. Elevators - can only access room floors by swiping your room key in order to push the button for your floor; good security measure, but can be an inconvenience (see below).Rooms - have a refrigerator; which is convenient in helping cut down food  beverage costs.Cons:Rooms - the rooms are very small, even for 2 people. Only 1 person at a time can be in the bathroom. The beds are very small and very hard and lumpy. Also, if you take a hot shower make sure you have the a/c on or else the steam will set off the smoke detector.Balcony/Lanai - there is none. The window only opens about 5 inches so you can't get a good breeze even if you wanted one.Elevators - sooo slow. There are 6 elevators total, but they don't all go to the same floors. 3 go from the lobby to floor 26 and the other 3 go to the lobby, floor 2  3, and then floor 27 to floor 44. The only time this is a problem is if you are trying to get to the pool which is on floor 5 . . . you have to switch elevators at either the lobby or floors 2  3. Also, accessing the elevators can be a pain. Since you have to swipe your room key to be able to select your room floor, you have to have your room key ready. If you just went shopping and have items in your hands, it can be a hassle.Pool - is VERY SMALL. The jacuzzi is almost the same size. The location of the building in relation to the pool/lounge chairs and the sun makes it difficult to tan. As the sun rises you have to keep moving to different lounge chairs to stay in the sun. I tanned for an hour and had to move 3 times to stay in the sun. Waikiki Beach would be fine, but it's several blocks away and always crowded and can be a hassel to carry all your stuff over there. Also, the pool area is very boring - visually. No landscaping, just a concrete slab.Noise - the doors to the rooms are very close to each other and you can hear when other guests are coming and going. Also, since you are in the city, you hear a lot of city noises (i.e. police sirens, car horns).So, if location is all you care about then you won't mind this place. BUT if the weather is bad and you're stuck in your room then you won't like it here. I wouldn't stay here again because I'd rather pay more to be comfortable regardless of how much time you spend in your room.

<Content>Great value for its price, excellent location Great value for its price, excellent location on a couple of minutes walk from Wakiki and around the corner from finest designer stores like Dior, LV and Prada (which is an indication of the great location). Don't pay any attention on the BS about the elevators, no hassle whatsoever! When we read the reviews we expected bad stuff, totally untrue! Rooms are small but super clean, personnel is very helpful, cleaning ladies absolutely sweet and willing to make your stay as pleasant as possible. But it is all about expectations: you are not paying for a Hilton, if you pay a budget price and go with expecting 5 star amenities of course you are disappointed. Typical hill billy reviews, anyone who has travelled will know that this is a great place to stay for a great budget on a top location. Would definitely recommend it! Go for the ocean view (any of the rooms ending on 04 on the 15th floor and up), beautiful view that in itself will make you happy!

<Content>Great value Oue experience at this hotel was fantastic. The rooms were small, but not tiny, but they were clean, as were the bathrooms. The lobby had a friendly atmosphere and staff were very helpful. The hotel is not too far away from the main strip of Waikiki and it is safe to walk. We were on one of the top floors and while the elevators were a little slow and it was sometimes annoying if you had to change elevators, but its not that bad! Overall, this was value for money and we would definitely return.

<Content>It is what it is We stayed during the week of the Pro-Bowl and spent 6 nights here. Allthough the room was very small, it was kept very clean. For a budget hotel, it performed to it's star rating, and maybe a little more.Our room was on the 6th floor and we used the stairs most of the time due to our impatience with the elevators.We chose this hotel because of the pool bar and large hot tub, and felt the lanai sacrifice was worth it. In hindsight, we would rather have had the lanai instead. Therefore, our next visit will be at a different property, since there are plenty Ohana budget hotels to choose from.

<Content>Fantastic place to stay in Honolulu We stayed here from 12/20 - 1/7 and 1/15. We had a oceanview room and were very pleased. For $68 per night, this is a great find near Waikiki.Pros: It was very clean and neat. The fridge and microwave helped cut down on food costs. The bathroom was small, but very clean and adequate for two people. The desk staff and housekeeping were very good, helpful. Lots of eating choices close by, good recommendations from hotel staff (use the coupons and publications that are everywhere to save money). The beach is a short walk through a really nice park. It's less crowded than the center of Waikiki. Cons: No lanai, and the windows only open a few inches. The pool is clean, but very unattractive surroundings, just a cement slab - this could and should be improved. The bar is very small, dark and drab - another improvement needed. The elevators can be slow at peak times, but nothing more than you would expect from such a large, tall hotel.

<Content>I am easy to please, but I did not buy into this place... Stayed here from 1/15/06 to 1/19/06. I am not a hard person to please, but these rooms were really small and the service was average. They are kind and courteous at check in but thats about all the service you are going to get. When asking for directions they expect you to know how to spell the hawaiian street names??? Hotel is old and a little run down. Most of the hotels are showing their age in waikiki, but you shouldnt have to settle for it. Alot of older hotels are rennovating their premises, so do your research and find a better hotel. Yes, it served its purpose, but sleeping and showering in a nice place would be cool too, wouldnt it?pro: hawaiian airlines check in kiosk on premisescon: close but still a walk to the better part of waikiki beach

<Content>Great for the price I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court in Honolulu from January 7, 2006 to January 15, 2006. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip, and the hotel was great as well. It was a great price, I booked it through Expedia and got the hotel and the flight as a package. It wasn't a fancy hotel, but considering that I wasn't in it much, just to shower and sleep, it definitely served the purpose of the room.Some of the other reviews I read complained about the elevators, but I didn't have any problems with them. There were a couple of times when I waited maybe 2 minutes, but it's a big hotel and I was on vacation, so it didn't matter anyway.the hotel room was always cleaned when I wanted it to be, the staff was super friendly, and there is a ton of restaurants all around the area, so there was no problem finding somewhere to eat.If I ever get the chance to go to Hawaii again, I will definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>better than I expected Having read reviews on this site, I selected this hotel as probably being the best rated cheap bed in Waikiki. I expected it to be clean, small, and basic. I wasn't disappointed. The room contained a hairdryer and iron which was a real surprise - often you don't get that in a bigger hotel - and ok toiletries if you needed to use them. Bed was firm but not uncomfortable. A refrigerator was very useful for the snacks, water etc you can pick up at the ABC store across the road. Staff were friendly, check in was simple, and I had no charges for things I didn't know about. Everything was clearly labeled if using it cost extra. Easy walking distance of everything and easy to find as its one of the taller hotels! There was a TV and game console, although why anyone would want one in Waikiki is beyond me....Would certainly go back if I'm on a budget.

<Content>fantastic value for money I stayed there for 2 nights in December - all i wanted was a place to sleep and leave my things so the small room/green carpet/no lanai etc were not a problem. The rooms were very clean, staff were friendly, the place felt safe, walking distance to beach, shops etc - my only complaint would be that i could hear people in the corridor but i've had the same in way more expensive hotels. I thought this place was great value for money and i'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Price  My mum and I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky in September 05 and we had an excellent stay (excellent package deal). The hotel is very clean. I agree the rooms are small, but you spend so much time outside shopping, eating and sightseeing that you are only at the hotel to sleep. The staff are friendly, although the check-in counter can be quite busy (we arrived at lunchtime and had about a 20min wait). This hotel is in a great position as you are opposite Fort DeRussy park and if you get a high floor with ocean view you get perfect views!! We loved going for a walk in the evenings as you can do a big loop of Waikiki from the hotel. You have an ABC store opposite the hotel which is handy for small snacks, drinks etc...... You also have a bus stop about 100 meters down the road and the stop has buses that go everywhere (to Ala Moana, around the island for $2.5US, they even go as far as Pearl Harbour and Pearlridge shopping centre). I would definitely go back again and stay at this hotel!!!

<Content>SO SO... just a place to sleep When we arrived at the hotel the front desk staff wasn't friendly and had a hard time to communicate with us in proper hotel staff manner. She was easily confused. We got a kitchenette room with queen size bed on 16th floor. Everything was clean and organized. Nice view, mostly city view and some ocean. Bathroom is quite small but was ok for two people. Everything worked in normal condition including air-conditioning. Room amenities were what we need except they didn't have q-tips, cotton balls, or shower caps like other hotels do. Our room has hair dryer, safe, iron and iron board, hangers, microwave, fridge, dishes and utensils. Once in awhile we hear some noise through the pipes in the wall or ceiling - not sure but the sound wasn't very pleasant! The shower head provide inconsistant flow of very hot or very cold water. Overall the hotel is quite old and need remodeling. Elevators are always crowded with people. I didn't bother to go to the pool or jacuzzi because they were really small. There was a bar on the same floor with the pool. Laundry facility was nice and convenient ($1.50 to wash and $1.25 to dry). Parking was convenient at $13/day ($15/day after Nov. 1st) There were some security guards walking around making sure. Our housekeeping ladies were very friendly. They don't do a very good job at straighting things out in our room. They only do the bed, change the garbage, leave you with some more shampoos or soaps and that's about all they do! BUT, you get what you pay for, really. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone who's looking for a bargain hotel because I truly think you can find better deals than this one.

<Content>Good Hotel at a Great Price My husband and I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court, October 17-22, 05. I have to say that I was a little nervous about staying there especially after reading some negative reviews on this site. I figured that we got such a good deal on the room that I would give it a try. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was clean. We always found parking even when we arrived at the hotel at 8 or 9 p.m. I think that there is one important thing you need to remember when you are booking your hotel... you are in Hawaii save on your room and use the extra money to rent a car and see all that Oahu has to offer! Oh one more thing we were on the 24 floor and we never waited for an elevator more than a couple of minutes. Remember you on on vacation hang loose!

<Content>great place for the price!! if you are looking for a resort like hotel...this place is obviously not it. if you're like me and are only in the room to sleep and shower and you plan to spend most of your days exploring Oahu beyond Waikiki then this place is well worth the money. It's decent sized and clean. My friends and I were there for 5nts in mid-October and it's not too far of a walk to Kalakaua. I would definitely stay here again and spend my money elsewhere like on a nice dinner at La Mer or some shopping at Ala Moana. Only drawback is that the elevators are very very very slow. Hallways could be kinda creepy as they are dark and narrow. Parking is $15/day but that is probably average for any hotel in Waikiki.

<Content>Our Honeymoon My new wife  I arrived in Hawaii (02.08.05-22.08.05) after along delayed flight; we were greeted at the hotel with smiling faces. They explained what was already was already paid for. Anything in the rooms like safe or phones is an extra charge. But they went on to say that there is payphone in the lobby. They have different company reps also in the lobby that will help out with any activity if need be, all useful information. My one complaint is on reception they can only cash travellers cheques for a $100.00 a day. But they did tell us there is a bank around the corner (5 minute walk), which can cash more if needed.I?ve been reading about the problems with the lifts, which can be very slow, but what can you expect on a 44-floor hotel with six lifts. To give you an idea (you?re working in 44 storey building and then think of the rush at lunch time, muff said) the problem with the lifts are the keys you need to get to you?re floor. Sometimes they work straight away sometimes they don?t. After a few tries go to reception and get card changed they are only too happy to help rather than suffer in silence. Our room (a kitchenette) was very comfortable ideal view of both the city streets  the sea in the background. Air-con was handy, shower was excellent, bath is ok if you?re 4` nothing otherwise stick to the shower. TV  radio were ok. Bed was very comfortable. Iron  board, a small table with 2 chairs, a fridge  a microwave all in the room. House keeping excellent, we had numerous lie in?s  still the room were cleaned after we eventually got up. There are plenty of small supermarkets nearby which we stocked the fridge with lots of goodies.There is a bar on the 5th floor where you can play Pool or Darts, there is also a Pool  Jacuzzi, with lots of deck chairs all of which were under used by people (not a problem)TGIF is downstairs so for the lazy days of not wanting to walk to other restaurants for early breakfast or late dinners it is ideal.The location of the Hotel is also handy as the bus stops that take you most activities on the island are all outside the hotel. The beach is a 10-15 minute walk. Around the corner also are High street shops till you drop. The hotel was ideal for us and would gladly stay again.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Especially for the money Nice hotel especially for the money paid. Room I stayed in was $89. Small room but great room and very clean. Great location on the edge of Wakikki (about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the main beach) but still plenty of activity around the hotel and conveniently right on the bus line. Excellent staff from front desk to security to housekeeping to check-out. Nice security feature was having to use your room card to get to the room floors. Walking distance to many restaurants and shops and TGI Friday's on the 1st floor. Larger hotel so plenty of people around - some extra elevators would be nice but never had to wait more to 3 or 4 minutes even at peak times. Nice pool area particularly the whirpool.

<Content>Good deal for the price Maybe I'm a little blinded because we didn't even have a hotel when we arrived in Hawaii or that we only paid $89 per night for the time we stayed there, but this hotel wasn't bad at all. It was very basic. Only the view was really worth remembering, as either side of the hotel will give you great views of the ocean, mountains, or even both. The front desk was great and always cheerful. The only thing that I would change if I had control of the hotel would be that I would have an observation deck at the top (44 floors I think). Maybe it would be much too windy, but it would be nice to be that high above Waikiki. If you get this hotel for around $100, it's a very good deal.

<Content>Budget hotel, but a great value! We stayed there in October 2004 and I would wholeheartedly recommend it. It is definitely both clean and safe. We got a very good deal financially and vacation is simply much more enjoyable when you don't feel you are being taken to the cleaners.The Ohana Maile Sky Court is a highrise, something like 30 floors, maybe more. They have only 2 types of rooms: 2 twins or one queen size bed. We weren't told that when we booked our package and expected a king size bed, but made do with the queen. The others in our party had a room with 2 twins. The rooms were identical except for the beds. Sort of small rooms, but certainly adequate. We were on the 24th floor and had nice views of the ocean and also the Ala Wai Canal. The hotel is basic accommodation, no extra frills, but everything is in good condition, and both the premises and the staff are pleasant and efficient. The pool is on the 5th floor, along with a bar. You can get some things such as a hair dryer, large or extra towels, by going to housekeeping and signing for them. You then have to return them when you leave and there is no charge. Very important to us was the business center on the ground floor, where you can use a computer with internet access for a cost of something like $1 for 10 or 15 minutes. You can either insert a bill or a credit card, in which case you will be charged for the time you used. They have a person who will assist you with travel related issues like booking tours, recommending places to see, etc. They will keep your luggage at the hotel on the day you check out and you can pick it up later on in the day - I believe that was free of charge. Location: located at the fork of Kuhio and Kalakaua Ave. This is at the western edge, not in the heart, of Waikiki, but the beach can be reached through a park and it's a very pleasant 5 minute walk. If you walk an extra couple of minutes, there is a beach to the right where there are tables, restrooms, and showers. To the heart of Waikiki, which I would say is the Duke Kahanamoku statue, is about a 10-15 minute walk. Downstairs there is a coffee-shop type eatery called TGIF where we ate a few times and both the food and service was fine. There are also numerous restaurants on Kuhio. If you are budget conscious, which I think you probably are if you are looking at a package at Ohana Maile Sky Court, the location is perfect, as the nearby eateries are likewise lower priced than for example those that are located in the heart of Waikiki and on the beach. I liked the location very much, the only real drawback was that during our stay there in October 2004 there was a lot of construction going on and Kuhio Ave. was closed to traffic and that caused us some headaches at the time. Parking at the hotel is reasonable, $10/day. They have adequate space available, with an multi-level garage structure adjacent to the hotel. The room had a microwave and a refrigerator, also a safe, plus a coffee machine. They charge you something like $2 each time you use their coffee supplies. There is no charge if you use your own.  We were very satisfied with this hotel and would stay there again. The others in my party were already coming back there for the second time.

<Content>Basic but comfy When we arrived we were automatically given our room key. We had pre-paid our room and was readily available. When we got to our room we realized it was a basic room, it consisted of of a queen bed and a tv and dresser. the room is really small. The view wasnt that great. We had the view of the hotel being built across the street. We asked to be moved to a bed w/ 2 beds and they upgraded us for free and they told us to pack our bags and that they would move our bags to the new room. We left for the day and we arrived back at the hotel they gave us our new keys. This room was much bigger, it had a partial view of the ocean, 2 single beds, a/c, table w/ 2 chairs, microwave, sink, small refrigerator and lots and lots of windows. the bathroom was much bigger and also had a big window. We had a problem w/ the water draining in the tub, but we called the front desk and they sent someone right away to fix the problem. The a/c worked great. The front desk was always nice and we didnt have any problems with them. The only problem that we had were that the elevators were slow. But we were on vacation and we werent in a hurry to get anywhere so that really didnt bother us. All in all, if your looking for somewhere basic to sleep and take a shower, then this is a good place. its not too far from waikiki. Its about a 10 minute walk to the beach. I woudnt mind staying here again.

<Content>OK but.... We stayed for a week from Australia. It was nice enough , but the pool bar and staff were very rude and unfriendly to myself and my group, and took a lot of business away from themselves as a result.It was offensive to us as guests there and because of it would never go back or ever recommend the place to anyone. It really was a sour spot in an otherwise fantastic trip to Hawaii. Hawaii we love it and will be back. (just not to that hotel)

<Content>Nice place for my few dollars I booked this hotel on Priceline for $45/day June 23-29. So, I'm writing this review from the hotel room. Most of the recent reviews of this hotel are accurate. It is a good bargain if you are able to get a good rate. Clean, safe, and decent location. Not as convenient to the beach as most Waikiki hotels, so, if you can afford it, you may want to book something closer. But this place is still close enough to the beach. There are no lanai's (balconies) at this hotel, which can add a lot to a stay in Hawaii. Parking is $12/day. I have a standard room, non-smoking, one queen bed, fridge, iron, blow dryer, ironing board, a/c unit, safe ($3.99/day), coffee maker (tho they charge for coffee packets - $2) and happens to have a partial oceanview. No broadband internet in the room, so it's $.99 each local call when you use the phone's data port to dial up. Phone is on the one night stand. TV on the dresser/desk. So, you may have use the bed or night stand for your laptop when dialing up as there is no phone on the dresser/desk. The staff/service here is nothing special, but OK. A few inconveniences: 1) At checkin, I was told that I'd have to re-checkin 5 days later because my reservation was 2 split in two. 2) I needed to add the 30th to my reservation, but the reservation desk said there was no availability, even though later I saw their own website shows availability of $99. I later mentioned this to the front desk and I was told I needed to reserve it online. I took this as a sign that the Maile Sky Court must not want my money, so, I am moving to another hotel across the street from the beach for $84 (Hotwire). Housekeeping actually honors the 'do not disturb' signs, yay, as I usually sleep in. Previously I stayed at a much more posh hotel and if you had the sign on the door, housekeeping would not knock and bother you, rather call and bother you?!?! I did notice that my linens wernt changed at least one day here, but towels were always replaced and they were always plenty. For the very budget minded, some of the cheaper eats nearby include Jack in the Box (24 hr), Egg n Things, McDonalds, Todai's, Wailana Coffee House (24 hr) and of course there is ABC to pick up snacks. However there is a Walmart, Foodland and Daiei a bit further on the outskirts of this end of Waikiki. A couple of bus stops right here too. All in all, not bad at all for the price I paid, so my concerns are minimal. At this price, one could extend his/her visit by a few days and/or rent a car with the savings. However, I would not be as pleased with my stay if I had to pay more. I've lived in Waikiki and other parts of Honolulu before, so I was not looking for anything more than value and basic accomodations.

<Content>Not The Ritz But the Price Was Right I stayed here for one night as a stopover from Seattle to the Big Island. I got a great deal on Expedia ($65 a night prepaid for each room. We had 2).If this was a 5 star hotel I would give it 3 stars on a review. This is a 2-3 star hotel that works hard for you and gives you good value for your dollar.The hotel rooms were not large but were OK sized. The bathrooms are a bit cramped but not bad. The condition of the rooms was well used but not abused. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The AC was a window unit that worked just fine- unfortunately the cooridors and elevators were a bit on the warm side for my taste. I will admit I'm not a fan of hot weather.I agree with one of the other reviews- the elevators were very, very slow. I had no problem parking when we returned at about 10 PM for the night.The Pool was shut down the days we were there and we heard other guests say- not again. apparently the pool had been shut down for parts or all of the previous several days. It didn't impact us as we were not planning on using it but I got the impression it was a problem they were working hard to fix.I'd say this is a good value- nothing fancy but a good place to spend the night.

<Content>Fnatastic Value Stayed 5 nights here from June 19th,so close to Fort de Rusy end of Waikiki beach so a lot fewer people in the water here.A much shorter walk than I had imagined and all the local buses within 30 metres.A big plus was the bus being empty due to the pick up point.Access to everything was great,I almost missed out going to the Kahala Mall thinking oh yes just another mall BUT it was great and I got lots of bargains,,,Waikiki can be expensive and the same old tourist things everywhere.However having said that there is plenty to do and see.I really only used the pink shuttle because I enjoyed the view along Wakiki beach.I used the bus for all other destinations except for the one day circle island tour by E Noa which was excellent value.I feel like I can easily find my way around Oahu now after only 5 days and as I travelled alone I found most people would talk to me and the locals were very friendly.I also felt safer than in many cities.Can't wait to go again.

<Content>Excellent and Clean Standard Room  Aloha, we enjoyed our 7 days stay in this hotel starting on June 13 to June 20, 2005. The location is just perfect; 10 minutes walk to Waikiki Beach; 3 minutes walk to Kalakaua Ave. - location of designer shops and more luxury hotels/restaurants; and the bus stop is just infront and on the side of the hotel. Our standard room on the 31st Flr. (3116) has a partial view of the Waikiki Beach; the city; the mountain; and the Ala Wai River/canal situated about 100 yards at the back of the hotel. Our room has a queen bed and a roll-away bed for our son; TV set; Ref.; Coffee Maker; Flat Iron  Board; Hair Dryer; and a Room Safe for our valuables/jewelries/documents. The room is very clean; air-con in very good condition; bathroom very clean; and the beddings/towels are very clean and were changed everyday. While the 31st floor is a smoking floor, our room and the hallway has no tobacco smell. The shower water is not that strong, but it's O.K. with us. There is also a free newspaper everyday. The Housekeeping staff are very courteous and helpful. They are mostly from the Philippines. They are just wonderful and made us feel we're welcome. We highly recommend this 2-star hotel; affordable  safe to stay while in Oahu/Honolulu. Food at TGIF is reasonable. The Deep End Bar on the 5th Flr. is fine. The pool and spa are O.K.. We commend the Concierge staff for assisting us in our guided tours/bookings. The Front Desk and Belldesk people are O.K., but they need to smile a little more when dealing with guests. I work in one of the Starwoods Hotels in California and the bellmen and Front Desk staff are the very first contact of hotel guests. Need I say more? Meanwhile, the elevators broke down twice when we were there due to heavy volume of guests traffic, but the response of the Otis technicians were quick. Even in 5-star hotels, elevators do break down. To sum it up, our stay at the Ohana Maile Sky Court Hotel was very pleasant, memorable and safe. The package tour that we got was really a big bargain and we are very thankful that we stayed in one of the 17 or so Ohana/Outrigger hotels in the Waikiki Beach area. Reminder, don't just say Ohana Hotel to your limo/cab/bus driver, because there are about 17 of them in the Waikiki area; please say Ohana Maile Sky Court or Ohana Sky Court. While this hotel is rated 2-Stars, We rated this hotel 5-Stars in terms of cleanliness of the room that we stayed in. Thanks and Mahalo. Ernie, Jean  Paul of Long Beach, CA

<Content>For what I payed I am completely satisfied I booked a trip to Honolulu in January '05 through Pleasant Holidays. For non stop airfare on Hawaiian from Phoenix and 5 nights at Ohana Maile Skycourt I payed $577. Initially I was a bit concerned with some of the reviews on the web but decided that that it would be an adventure. The Skycourt is a skyrise, as the name implies, close to Waikiki. Staying at this hotel it was possible to walk for food, to the beach, shopping, etc. There is a Dollar rent a car stand not half a block away. I choose to rent at the airport and pay the $13/day to park. I was prepared for an awful parking situation but frankly, the end of January must not be a busy time in Hawaii because I had no trouble parking at anytime (or the reviews on this site scared people), most nights I returned between 5 pm-9pm. Frankly, when you factor in the $13 a day to park it might just be cheaper to rent from the Dollar rental stand that is 1/2 block away. As for the hotel itself it is dated but I felt that the staff did their best to keep it clean. My room was decorated in a style I call 80's kitsch (if you remember when the Golden Girl's opened that hotel in Miami you've got the right idea). I could hear the pipes of the bathroom above me but that didn't bother me. The staff was all very pleasant and nice. I read one review where they called this hotel a dump and said people should stay at the Ko Olina Marriott instead. I've stayed at the Ko Olina and that is a very nice hotel but I think that comparison is unfair. There is a difference between a 5 star hotel and a 2 star hotel. And frankly, while the hotel might be a little worn the staff really was lovely, which makes up for a lot. I am a mid 20's single woman travelling alone and I never felt unsafe.For the price I payed, this place could not be beat. It was awesome. If you get a cheap package deal I HIGHLY reccommend this hotel.

<Content>Not bad at all The Ohana Maile Sky Court is definitely a great value. It's ranked a two star hotel but the staff makes you feel like you're staying in a 5 star. The only complaint I have is that the elevators are sooooooooo slow!!! It takes 10+ minutes to get to your room from the lobby. It's a great place to stay at if you really want to explore the island of Oahu and spend very little time in a hotel. It's only a couple of blocks from the beach and only a few minutes walk to the International Market Place and the Ala Moana Shopping Mall. This hotel is also conveniently located on the same street (Kuhio) as the happening night time activities. You won't be disappointed if you are there to have a good time and keep an open mind!

<Content>Good value We stayed at Ohana Maile Sky Court for three nights. This is a good value hotel.The pool was well kept and this hotel is close enough to the beach to walk.The staff was friendly and helpful.The only problem we had was when they put us in a smoking room when we are both allergic to tobacco smoke. They changed our room after a short discussion.Yes, the elevators are slow.If we go back to we will probably stay in a different hotel.

<Content>Good deal for the money I paid This is not a five star hotel. It is off the beaten path but for $57.00 a night, I was pleased. It was very clean, neat and sized just right for two. I had asked for a high floor and got 15 out of 24 floors. I wasn't pleased about that, but no worry. The TV channel selection was pitiful. The parking is convenient but expensive and can get crowded since many people do park illegally. I was unable to find that free public parking that was bragged about. The desk staff was hit and miss on being knowledgable. One day, we hit the jackpot with a kind gentleman at the desk calling and making dinner reservations for us. This might not be a big deal to a lot of people but it made us feel very special. We were here only three nights and found most attractions within walking distance. If I were in Waikiki to earnestly vacation, I would pick someplace else. But if you just need a bed, this is a good deal.

<Content>Ohana is Hawaiian for Sucky Hotel This hotel is located on the northern edge of Waikiki and is suitable for people needing a hotel only to sleep. We stayed 4 nights and will never book another Ohana hotel.Finding your room is like following a maze in the dark. Doorways are tucked into tiny, dark hallways which would make any rational woman fear for her life. Hopefully you and the person next door agree on the same TV channel or music station because you can hear everything they do.Separate charges for coffee, safe and 2nd room key? Unbelievable.Wanna watch TV? You have the choice of 7 advertising channels (2 in Japanese), ABC, NBC, CBS, ESPN, and TBS. Welcome to 1975.Thinking about a shower? The 3/4 tub/shower will spray your belly so learn to shower on your knees. Enjoy the luxury of drying off with a worn, Motel-6-sized towel.Forget about the laundry: $2 to wash and $1.25 to dry but it took $3.75 to dry one load of wash.Longest elevator wait: 3 minutes. Shortest wait: 20 seconds. We stayed on the 14th floor. And the elevator was full about 30% of the time requiring another 2-3 minute wait.Don't bother paying $25 more for a room with a view. The only view you're going to have is slices of the beach viewed between hotels actually on the beach or nearby. The Sky is 4 blocks to the water. Technically it is 2 blocks from the Ala Moana lagoon but no sane person would ever want to get wet in that toxic soup.Parking is $13 per day and they allow in and out but finding a space after 3pm requires some creative parking in areas you might not think were permitted. Ignore the Lot Full sign because everyone else does. Don't worry about blocking somebody else in because the hotel doesn't care so why should you?The pool is slightly larger than the spa. The ratty deck chairs look like they've been in the sun for at least 4 years.Yes, there is a TGI Friday's on the ground floor but, unlike most stores in the chain, they don't have the TVs turned to sports stations nor do they play music. Service is typically Hawaiian meaning slow and incapable of remembering difficult orders like Ranch dressing for a Cobb salad.

<Content>Great Place! This place is great! Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1. It's one of the first hotel stops from the airport if you take the shuttle bus.2. You can easily walk to the popular beach attractions (Duke's, the beach, shopping, restaurants, etc) within 10 mins (nice walk too).3. There is a Fridays restaurant right downstairs. They have a nice/inexpensive breakfast.4. There is a safe in the room, which I didn't get charged the $3/day for.5. Check in/check out was a breeze. 6. If you have a later flight, they will hold your luggage, and they have a hospitality suite where you can shower/freshen up before your flight home.7. They have a place in the lobby where you can book excursions, dinner reservations, etc. 8. There are about 3 grocery (small) stores within a block on the Sky Court.9. The view is nice! You can see the ocean (sort of) from most rooms.10. I had a small (but big enough for 1-2 people) room, with a bathtub, fridge, COLD A/C, TV, etc.11. There is one wall that is totally mirrors in the room. Good for checking out your outfit before you head out. 12. Room was super clean. Housekeeping was great!13. Hotel is quiet.14. Newspaper at your door every morning.15. You have to put in your room key to use the elevator. Nice security feature....but a bit of a pain when there are 4-6 stops. 16. Bed was comfortable!17. Information desk was very helpful. Gave tips on which tours to avoid, which bars are good on which nights, etc. Cons:1. SLOW elevators!2. The hallways (while you are waiting for the elevators) are a bit hot.3. It's $1 to call local (not too bad).4. The room's decor was a bit dated..but really...for $60-70/night...who cares???

<Content>Good value, clean room, nice staff, no problems My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 3/9 to 3/22. On my budget, the low price allowed me to stay in beautiful Hawaii longer than I could have at a fancier hotel. It also allowed me to plan more activities. We went to the Audobon Center, the Don Ho Dinner Show, a day trip to Kauai, a full day fishing charter, Sea Life Park, the Zoo, and the Polynesian Cultural Center. We spent three times as much on activities and restaurants as we did on our hotel. We never saw a crawling insect in the hotel despite my wife leaving the windows open at night. The little extras cost extra, but they told us up front, so we didn't use the services that we didn't want to pay for. They did not charge us for the daily newspaper, the elevators were sometimes slow, but tolerable, parking was not a problem. Bottom line: I'll trade luxury in for fun any day, and I'll be back.

We had an ocean view room on the 23rd floor, and sometimes took the express elevator to the 26th and walked down to our floor. The room was clean and comfortable, and the shower was awesome (lots of instant hot water and good water pressure). We didn't bother renting a car, and just walked or took the bus everywhere. The location is very convenient as downtown Waikiki and Ala Moana Center are within walking distance, and buses that go to the airport run by just outside. I would stay here again without hesitation... and hope to do so before it turns into a condotel.

<Content>Great location and price I stayed here when I came to town with a conference and on a very tight budget. The room was clean and within walking distance to the conference center and everything in Waikiki. The pool was tiny but the jacuzzi was huge. There's also a bar next to the jacuzzi with a very friendly bartender. The TGI Fridays on the first floor was convenient for breakfast. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Some friends of mine were stranded when their lodging fell through on Valentine's Day (the busiest day of the year for Waikiki/Honolulu hotels) and the Ohana staff was able to find them a place to stay. The concierge also arranged a tour to Hanauma Bay so that we would be able to go snorkeling and make it back in time for conference proceedings. And to top it all off, they stored my luggage on my last day so that I could check out and continue treking around Waikiki. They also had shower and changing facilities so that people wouldn't have to fly home sandy from the beach.

<Content>Roaches on the mirrors! We spent 10 day in March last spring and after switching rooms 3 times finally had the room we could stay in. We have stayed here several times in the past and never saw a roach but this time I think we made up for the last 4 stays..... They must have a problem on a certain floor or two. Aside from that we like the location, people and the price. Our last stay however caused me to upgrade to a better hotel for this year and pay a bigger bill, I guess the rooms are only syuppose to be for two.... people that is.

<Content>Great hotel for the price I have been to Hawaii 14 times mainly staying in the Ohana east. It was alot more money than this hotel. This hotel room was a bit smaller, but was very comfortable and very clean. I would not be afraid to stay there again on my next visit. The Hotel staff were very friendly and very accomodating. The tgif restarant was excellent, great burgers and food. the sun deck was big and you could always find the sun to tan. The pool bar made really good mai tais and lava flows. We were there Jan.28th to Feb.19th except for three days we went to Maui.

<Content>Modest, nice hotel We stayed in the Ohana Maile Sky Court for only 3 nights and it was good. Rooms are not very big, but we only slept there so we didn't care. It's a very tall building (40+ stories) with annoying elevators which take forever. But, we had an ocean view (they upgraded us for free when we arrived) on the 37th floor which was beatiful. It's within walking distance to the beach (5-10 min walk). It's also on the bus line so you can use the bus to get to Pearl Harbor (allow plenty of time) or Diamond Head. The bathroom was a little small but fine and in good working order. The water pressure in the shower was great. The staff was all very nice and helpful, especially the travel info guy who helps you with maps, etc. There's a pool on the 5th floor roof which we never used. If you are looking for someplace to just sleep, this is perfect. If you are looking for a fancy resort, this may not be the place. We'd stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel - no balcony tho I stayed at this property in June 2004 for an extended period of three weeks. I asked for a non smoking room upon check in, and because I was staying three weeks, they gave me a kitchenette on level 43. A corner room faceing the ocean/Hilton Hawaiian Village and city of Honolulu. This place has a hotel feel, a nice concierge desk with friendly staff, a nice little pool bar and a fair sized pool and spa. That pool area is pretty hot in the Hawaiian sun, not much shade or lanscaping/palm trees etc. My room was quiet, pretty good sized - but I was travelling alone - and it was a kitchenette after all. Everything was clean, but watch the extra costs, like daily newspapers and your coffee/tea etc. (buy a small jar at a nearby ABC store) The elevator service seemed okay considering, (but the upper floor users had to change elevators to go to the pool area). I usually stay at the more expensive Ohana Waikiki Tower, on Lewers street, and that has slow elevators and suffers from street noise due to its location. The only thing I missed at the Maile Sky Court, was a nice little lanai (balcony) to sit out on at night. For the money, it's not all that bad!! Aloha.

<Content>Great Value! We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to a cruise. The value was great! Hotel was clean, room was comfortable. Good location (not on the beach, but centrally located). There is a TGI Fridays Restaurant in the building, stores nearby.The only complaint? Elevators were a little slow - but other than that, it was an excellent value!

<Content>Loved it 100% All the way from England on a buget and found this budget hotel to be fantastic. Ok the rooms are alot smaller than normal USA standards, they are more the size of Spanish hotel rooms, but when you're in Hawaii the last place you spend alot of time is in your room. The staff were friendly and the location was excellent. Situated at one end of Kuhio Ave you are within walking distance of all the attractions of Waikiki. The designer shops, the souvenier shops, the out door market plus many more. Also ideally situated close to numerous bus stops. All in all this was the best holiday I have had and would return to this hotel in a second.

<Content>About average My wife and I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court for the last week of January.We walked in our room and based on the reviews here on this site, knew our room and bathroom would be small. So, no real surprise. Maybe a 10x11 size room for the bed, desk and tv with an additional 8x2 entry way (including the open closet and safe). The room and bathrom was clean and the staff kept it that way for the entire week.The bed was very stiff and unforgiving.Parking cost $13 a day but we did not run into any problems of finding a parking spot late at night. I think that may be due to the fact that there weren't a lot of people there in Waikiki for the last week of January. The parking slots are small, so keep that in mind if you're going to rent an SUV or minivan.The front desk staff was professional, but not outwardly friendly.Yes, the elevators are slow, but you're in Hawaii and do you really need to get there that quickly?While maps show this hotel to be on the edge of Waikiki, it is a very short walk to the strip of Waikiki and it is only a block from Niketown and a couple of blocks from Tiffanys. Pretty much everything is within a short walking distance.The pool is very small and you'd be better off going to the beach as there aren't a lot of chairs to relax on at the (5th floor) pool.Becauseof the uncomfortable bed, we couldn't get a good night sleep and that would prevent me from returning because we accepted the hotel based on the thinking that it's just a place to sleep.Hope this helps.

<Content>Great Location, Few Flaws This is a nice place to stay if one is requiring a room to sleep in after a long day at the beach. Even though there was no hair dryer, the room included a refrigerator. Newspaper in the mornings was a nice touch. Front desk staff was professional. Only hiccup was the information desk attendant; he was not familiar with the location of a few hotels in the area. I will return to the hotel.

<Content>Thought it was great We totally enjoyed our stay at the Ohana Maile Sky Court. It was clean and nice and had everything we needed. We did not go to Hawaii to hang out in our hotel room anyways so for sleeping and relaxing it was ideal. We would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to stay with good rates. No complaints!!

<Content>Value for money We booked here just for our first 2 nites of our week in hawaii and found it to be great, we had free upgrage to room with kitchen, which we reminded them of and were very happy with our room not huge but big enough and very neat and tidy with a distant views from the 2o th or 22 floor of beach and the great hills of hawaii and were great to look at of a nite the lights on the hills looked like lava. the rooms where good and the only thing we found annoying was the the very slow elevators and slow hot trip in them to your room.The location wasnt too bad to walk to shops and restaurants, takeaways, was a little further than some but not to far even from the beach and markets which are great, but be sure to bargin with them other wise you well pay to much at the markets know what you are buying and what its worth.We then moved for the rest of our stay to one of the outrigger chain closer to the beach as we had been happy with here. I recommend it here and is cheap with all you need even air con.All the hotels charge for car parking there. I would stay again

<Content>Nice Hotel We just spent 7 nights at the Ohana Maile Sky Court.December 23 through December 30, 2004. My husband and I stayed there 19 years ago for our 1 year anniv. and this time we went back with our 2 boys. It is an inexpensive hotel and located in a nice spot. We were upgraded to an ocean view room on the 40th. floor for an extra $10 a day. It was worth it. They were going to put us on the 10th. originally. The boy's rooms were also moved up to the 40th, but no charge because it was the same... standard room. Yes the rooms are small, but your not in Hawaii to stay in a hotel room. Just a place to sleep. The rooms were CLEAN and housekeeping kept them clean. The staff was very nice and helpful. Maitenence came right up when we had a problem w/the safe and fixed it right away. There is a parking garage and it is $10 a day. In and out as much as you would like. I wouldn't recommend getting in too late because it is on a first come first service basis. We always had a parking place. We got in by 7 or 8p.m. There is a TGIFridays at the hotel and they serve breakfast which is resonable and good. We were happy with the hotel and we would return. Oh, as for the elevators, they weren't too bad. One time there was only 1 elevator working for the upper floors. But they were fixed the same day. There are 6 elevators, 3 for Floors 5 throught 25 and 3 elevators for floors, 2,3, and 26 through 44. It was nice to go back to a place that you've stayed at before, especially after 19 yrs. Shopping has changed there, More upscale stores. I would definately recommend this hotel. It's not the Ritz or the Hilton, but then again you are not paying for the Ritz or Hilton. Very economical. Hope this review has helped. Thanks.

<Content>Very good bargain Best bargain in town. Can't go wrong with Outrigger properties. It's a small walk from the centre of Waikiki, but still considered to be in good venue, friendly staff, in room fridge is a nice touch. Fresh Honolulu Advertiser Newspaper at your door every morning. I stayed there extended period of time and was very satisfied, considering the price. Down side is the infamous sloooow elevator, parking becomes full frequently and you will be directed to other Outrigger hotel chain. All outgoing phone calls are charged at $1/call. Room is rather small. However, both times I stayed there, I got west facing view which was fantastic (especially the 37th floor). Facilities are bit old but $$ is very reasonable. Not a 5 Star Hotel but genuinely comfortable place. I'm not a tourist (I'm a local) but for anyone seeking the sun at the beach, this place is a-OK. I stay in hotels more than 260 days a year and I think my review is pretty fare. Give it a try!

<Content>"Lovely views - a bit old though" We had a wonderful view of Waikiki beach on the 35th floor. The hotel was quite old and a little cramped but we had a nice time. It is in a great location and has good facilities such as, TGI Fridays underneath it, Internet, a great laundrette, and a gift shop. This hotel is just 10 minutes walk to Waikiki beach and 5 mins from all the fantastic shops!. Loads of great restaurants and friendly staff!

<Content>Excellent deal for the price I don't think you can find any better place to stay in Honolulu than Ohana Maile Sky Court for the price. I paid about $60 per night including taxes. Here are a few thoughts:1. The room was small (especially the bathroom) but adequate. We stayed on the 20th and got a partial view of the ocean.2. The wait for elevator was always less than 5 minutes. Some people may find this a long wait but it was ok for me since I expected worse. I think some other reviews were just exaggerated. 3. Parking may be a problem but it was ok. There are limited parking spots in the garage. One night we came back at around 10:30pm and it was full. The attendant told us to wait a little and a car came out a few minutes later. The $10 parking fee was not bad considering it is within walking distance to the beach and all the shops.Again, for $60 a night, you can't ask for more. I am very happy with my stay here.

<Content>READ THIS!!! Not worth the cheap prices! We just returned from a six night stay the Ohana Maile Sky Court. We received inexpensive package deal and being that my husband and I had never been to Hawaii before we decided to go. We arrived around 11pm and drove around the hotel at least 6 times before finding the parking garage. Once we found it, we went up to the top of the garage to find that there was absolutely no parking. I used my cell phone to call the hotel and ask if they had any suggestions and they told me to talk to the parking attendant who would direct us to another garage. When we asked the attendant where to go he said, I don't know. We asked if there was another place or garage we could park at and he said no. He offered no assistance at all and went back into his booth. I was now livid. When I called the hotel staff again and told them that the attendant didn't give us any alternatives, they said they couldn't help us. We ended up parking 10 blocks away and had to drag our 5 bags along with us to the hotel. We finally made it to the hotel and got our room around 2am. Our room was on the 25th floor, which was a split level floor and now had to drag our luggage down a tiny flight of stairs. The room was tiny. Hardly enough room for the bed, our luggage, and the both of us. The bathroom was smaller than any I had ever seen. The air condintioner was extremely loud and the entire room reeked of smoke. (I had requested a non-smoking room.) One day the towels that were left in our room were dirty and stained. We weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room but it was still a huge hamper on the trip. Elevators. Every day we were there at least one of the elevators was not working. Twice we waited 20 minutes for an elevator. There is no air conditioning in the halls or in the elevator and with the humidity it made it worse. On our last night at the hotel, around 11pm the power went out No air conditioning, no electricity, and for some reason we also had no water. We cracked our window the few inches it would open but it didn't help much. A few hours later it came back on.I am a bargain traveler and have stayed at several inexpensive hotels and motels before. This hotel is definately at the bottom of my list. The only positive thing I can say about the hotel is that on the 25th floor we did have a view of the ocean. I would have traded the view for a more comfortable room in a minute's notice. I wish our first experience in Hawaii would have been better and know that we will never stay at this hotel again.

<Content>You don't get what you don't pay for Cheap, somewhat troublesome, yet adequate hotel. Stayed 1 night in October 2004. Room was old, sparcely furnished, yet clean. No balconies on any rooms, but a great view of the city from the 23 rd floor windows. The elevators were slow and the hotel room had a strong sewer oder. But I opened the window and ran the fan and after a while I got used to it. Pool was OK. Lobby was tiny. Kind of a long walk to the beach. This is the hotel for starving college kids and families on a budget. Not bad, but you could do better for a little more money. Upgrading to the Ohana Waikiki West is a good idea, if you can afford it. I probably won't stay here again but would still recommend it to people on a very tight vacation budget.

<Content>Ohana Maile Sky Court Hotel Ohana Maile Sky Court Waikiki....Nice trip and nice hotel. Staff was always friendly and courteous. Hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the beach through Fort DeRussy Park. Stayed on the 29th floor and what an ocean view! Have read reports that the elevators take forever. Not bad actually. They did overbook the hotel-to-parking ratio and parking was scarce. We were asked to park 4 blocks down at another Ohana Hotel.Was only inconvenienced as torrential rains made the walk back soggy. Other than that a real nice place!

<Content>Tiniest Room I Have Ever Seen First, let me start with positives: this was the cheapest place we could find in Honolulu. We were on our way to the mainland from the Big Island and had some business on Oahu that took longer than we planned, so we had to find a room at the last minute. The Maile Sky Court was available and reasonably priced. The lobby is an attractive open air area, and the hotel is easily accessible, right where Kuhio branches off.That said, here are the not-so-positives: the room--tiny does not even begin to describe it! I've NEVER seen a hotel room that small. Our room was supposedly a handicapped room, but a wheelchair would never be able to maneuver in it. Basically you entered into a short, narrow hall that widened at one end just enough for a bed and with a small bathroom at the opposite end. But the real problem was parking. Although there was a hefty charge, when we went to park, there were absolutely no spaces in their small, cramped lot. Cars were parked every which way so we had to back out the way we had come, scared we would wreck something all the way. The attendant suggested we wait an hour and take her place when she went off duty (after midnight). But the way other cars were parked, my husband did not think he could make the almost 90 degree turn with so little room to get into the small space. The desk clerk said that they had an arrangement with another property about three or four blocks away that would have plenty of parking. My husband who walks with a cane wasn't eager to take on that kind of trek at the end of a long, tiring day. So finally the clerk called a friend at a hotel about a block away and arranged for us to park there. We appreciated his willingness to help, and that arrangement worked out fine. But still, considering the amount they charged for parking, they need to have some better arrangements available.We would not stay at this hotel again and do not recommend it to others despite its reasonable price. You can find something much better for not too much more...

<Content>Better than Expected Stayed here because we got a great deal. Had another couple with us. Actually, I stayed at this hotel approximately 25 years ago. It is still a good choice. Yes, the elevators can be slow. But here are a few advantages. Though small, many of the rooms have great views. We stayed on the 10th floor and still had an ocean view. The higher floors have less traffic noise. Most important, the place is clean! Staff very friendly and accomodating. Keoni by Keo's restaurant is a short walk with a great 2.99 breakfast deal (and highly recommended for dinner). Being a walk from the beach also favors slightly lower restaurant prices in the area. TGIF's is located in the hotel. Skip the happy hour, drinks are weak. Convenient parking garage. Another great feature if you plan to leave Waikiki alot is easy access out! Saves time in traffic. If you don't plan to live in your room and a short walk to the beach is no bother, than this is the place to stay. As a former travel agent, I recommend this hotel to those who want a good place to sleep.

<Content>Good value Hotel was good value. Clean. Great view (if you have ocean view room). I didn't wait more than one minute for elevators (were pretty quick). Just make sure you take your Cell phone with you so you don't pay 99cents per call. My Att and T-mobile cells worked fine there. Also, take tea/coffee bags with you so you don't pay $2 per bag. Although the hotel is 3 blocks from the ocean, it is not where the action is. The beach where the action is (waikiki beach) is actually about 10 blocks from the hotel. This was the only thing I didn't like. But it was only 10 minute walk and the walk is on the main street (kaukala) so there was pleanty to see on the way.The staff was not bad also.

<Content>Glad I doubted myself I decided to visit Hawaii as a spur of the moment thing. I choose Ohana maile as I got a good deal on it. Then I checked this site for reviews and I nearly changed accomodations as I was staying for 10 days. But I'm glad I didn't, the lifts never took more than 5 mins which was my main concern. The rooms are big compared to where I work in NZ which is a 5star hotel so I was pleased and it was clean. It was situated away from the main throng of crowds but very close to everything. I had the best time down there and I will stay there again.

<Content>Tiny, but cheap This is an economical property with clean, but tiny rooms. The rooms were very cramped for my wife and I. It reminded us of a stereotypical Motel 6 type of property with low end rooms and small beds. If one only wishes to sleep and not really view anything from the windows, the windows could not be open except for about 2 inches, it might work for you. However, my wife and I will not be staying here again since there are many other economical properties with nicer, more open rooms, even within the Ohana chain. The one item we did really like about this hotel was the TGI Firday's located at its base.

<Content>Excellent place to stay We have stayed in this hotel 5 times. The Staff is excellent and the value can not be beat. We have stayed at several other hotels in Honolulu and Waikiki and would put this hotel up against any of them. The suites are huge, and the rooms are always very clean. There are no balconies, but all the other advantages make up for it. Ohana means family, and that is what you will feel like when you stay here. We liked this hotel MUCH better than the Outrigger Reef on the beach. GREAT Value!

<Content>Look at this review! It will help! Okay, so let's start from the beginning. My brother and I decided to plan a random trip to Hawaii this September (13-20th 2004). We wanted a nice hotel but something cheap so that we could afford to do all the activities honolulu has to offer. We went through Expedia and found Maile Sky Court. We knew it wasn't luxury or anything, but it seemed to be perfect for what we needed. After checking it out, I decided to check here for reviews---bad idea. Some of them were so blatantly awful that I started second guessing my original choice. In the end, we found a really good deal w/ Maile, and decided to go for it. We figured if we hated it, we'd just spend all day at the beach! So, let me just tell you....I am SO glad we decided to stay @ this hotel! The staff is SO friendly! We are young, only 22 and 18 and we figured they would ignore our needs and requests thinking we were just young kids. We were wrong...they answered all questions with a smile, and were always very friendly to us. The rooms are fairly small, but the views from the higher floors are amazing! The elevators really aren't that bad. We had a 41st floor room, and we never really waited more than 5-10 min top for an elevator. It's not that big of a deal. The higher floors are actually better, because the only troubles we saw, had to do with the elevator being full on the way down...we never had that problem, and our view was incredible! The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfy. Beware a bit of the sink counter in the bathroom...I have some souvenier bruises from it because I am clumsy by nature and it protudes a bit....but for the record, my brother didn't hit it once in 8 days so maybe it was just me!Another thing great about this hotel is the location! It isn't right on the beach and at first that concerned us (we were afraid it would take forever to get there)--but in the end we were happy to be a bit further from the huge mass of hotels lining the beach. It was only about 5 min walk and its a pretty walk...lots to see and do on the way. Maile is located right near the fishmarket (honolulus best restaurant..literally across the street), plenty of ABC stores, Kalakaua (sp?) ave which hosts planet hollywood, nike town, designer stores, and all the hip locals doing art (AMAZING art at that), dancing, etc on the side of the road. There is also the Waikiki food court which has lots of good (cheap) food, and there is the cheesecake factory and of COURSE the International marketplace (I was obsessed....Don't be afraid to bargain. The first day I went I was too nice about it. I learned quickly and in the end I got 3 huge duffel bags for 20 bucks total! and they were cute too!). the TGIFridays in the lobby is great too. You get a coupon book worth about 250 dollars in dining discounts; take advantage of it! We saved a lot of money. And take advantage of the activity reps downstairs in the lobby. We got some great rates on some fantastic trips (our favorite wasthe Hawaiian Isle Adventures....if your going, check it out. It is offered at the sky court). So, as you can probably tell by this lengthy review, Maile is the perfect place to be. The location is perfect, the staff is friendly, the views are amazing, there is a business center for pretty cheap rates (3 dollars for 20 minutes, 1 dollar minimum), a great restaurant, a cute and happenin bar on the pool floor (and a huge jacuzzi), and comfortable beds. Don't worry about the small bathrooms, or the elevators...seriously....you are in HAWAII.....if you get a hotel for fast elevators and big bathrooms, you'll waste your money and you wont have any left to do all that waikiki has to offer.....and believe me..there is ALOT! Don't be scared....you'll be pleasantly surprised! We sure were!Thanks-Tara

<Content>This hotel is a great deal! this hotel is quite the deal if you are looking for an economy place to stay. You have to keep in mind that our rate was about 50 bucks a night from an internet site. The room was far from a five star hotel but reasonalbe nonetheless. The room was clean, the staff friendly, and the hotel is a reasonable walk form everything. They have a roof-top pool and hot tub as well as a little bar that we enjoyed. We had a red-eye flight home at the end of our stay and the hotel provided a complementary room for us to shower and change before we left. Also, the TGI Fridays in the lobby is always running awesome specials.

<Content>Great Value This hotel was a 3rd option in a air hotel package. We did not have high expectations as the package was a very reasonable price. We were up graded to a room with a microwave. The room was small but clean and adequate. No balconey but we were out of the room most of the time. The pool area is basic but again quite acceptable for the price. Location is also very convenient. The restaurant TG Fridays which is connected to the hotel was also excellent. I suggest sitting at the bar and having a meal and a drink their. If you are on a budget this hotel is the one to stay at.

<Content>Hang Loose and less! In trying to save some money, we stayed here. Room was VERY small, but frig was nice. TGI Fridays in the lobby was GREAT! HOWEVER - the water quit every day we were there. We are not just talking 15 seconds....10-15 minutes. Twice in the middle of showers, once just washing sand off face. And it was not just in the AM. So who knows? When approaching the staff...they were confused, then approached again the 2nd time - could have cared less? Definitely a Hang Loose place? Location wasn't too bad. About 3-4 blocks to beach. Next time - I would pay the extra and stay nicer and on beach...wasn't worth the little I saved

<Content>My room was clean and the price was great! I got a great price on this room through a package deal. It is true that the elevators are slow and that it can drive you crazy (ask to be placed on a lower floor if possible - though you will miss the views). But the room and bathroom, although both small, were clean and comfortable. (But don't use the coffee packets provided in the room - they charge $2.08 for them and the coffee, although Kona, is strong and bitter.) The view from the corner windows was amazing and beautiful at night.The Skycourt staff were great. They changed my room from 1 double bed to two twins. They also changed out an electric socket in the wall at 9:00 p.m. when it turned out to be a problem (we had thought it was the lamp).The parking garage does have small spaces - don't rent a car anyway - you can get where you want without it and it is $10.00 per day to rent the garage space. I rented a car and wished I hadn't. Let someone else drive you through the often awful Honolulu/highway traffic.The TGIF in the hotel is great for breakfast, when you want a salad and if you want Atkins for supper. Keo's Restaurant, just down the street, is also great with nice ambiance. The hotel really is not far from the beach and if you walk over to Ala Moana Blvd. to behind the Hilton Hawaiian Village you will find a beautiful beach in 10 minutes. There is a bar there on the beach and the view of the ocean and sky is beautiful after sunset.I would definitely stay at this hotel again. I have done a fair share of traveling and I can tell you that for the price, location and cleanliness this hotel is a very good value. I think people who are overy critical of this hotel don't really understand what a true value they are getting. Hotel room prices in Waikiki can be outrageous.

<Content>excellent budget choice I stayed at the Skycourt for two weeks in August and found it to exceed my expectations . Budget accomodations in Hawaii can be pretty grim , but the Skycourt offers a clean , well run and friendly hotel that is probably as good as you will find for the money . Rooms are small but well appointed and well maintained . The elevators can be slow but this was a problem for me only once in two weeks . The location is very central and it is possible to walk anywhere from Kapiolani Park to Ala Moana . Busses are right there . And the high rise design puts most rooms above the traffic noise and provides even many of the least expensive rooms with an excellent view . I will return .

<Content>Don't be scared off We got this hotel for $54/nt from an internet site. In my opinion, this is the best deal in Oahu. Pros: Location is pretty good; parking is easy in the garage (though $10/nt); there are many places nearby for breakfast, lunch, dinner; the room was very big (we had a non-smoking higher floor with a queen sized bed) and the bathroom, though small, was clean and adequate; we never really had a long elevator wait; our room had ocean views and a view of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel with a backdrop of the ocean. Lovely! Cons: The limited number of tv channels (but who's in the room ever in Waikiki?); I guess that's it!

<Content>Crappy hotel with a nice view This place was a drag. As others have mentioned, the elevators take forever. We stayed on the 42nd floor and sometimes had to wait up to ten minutes for an elevator. Just hope you don't leave anything in the room. The only consolation was an incredible view from that level. The room was nothing special, tiny bathroom. There was a small fridge which was nice. Both my boyfriend and I cut our fingers on metal plates on the door to our room. When we notified the hotel staff, they were very dismissive and did not seem to care. The staff was also not very helpful with information either. When we asked them about public transportation, they said there was none, when we found out later there was. Its about a 15 minute walk from the beach, and its not a good part of the beach really. Most of the Waikiki action is down at the other end. Additionally, a fire alarm went off in the middle of the night, 3 times! When in fact there was no fire or emergency. I recommend spending a little more for something nicer and closer to the beach.

<Content>You get what you pay for.... Well, the bright side is that the place is cheap. If you are on a tight budget, this may be the place for you. I was, so I cannot complain about the price. However, there were some serious flaws. I should state that I am by no means a finiky person. I am pretty comfortable where ever I stay, as long as it's clean and generally comfortable. The ohana Malia was unfortunately neither of these. When I first checked in, they told me that they did not have a non smoking room available for a couple hours. I was really tired, so I agreed to take a smoking room with the knowledge that I could change if I didint like it or couldnt bare the smoke. When I walked into this room, I was disgusted. The bed, oh the bed.....it seemed barely put together, the sheets were not even tucked in and the top blanket seemed like it had been just used. In a nut shell, im not so sure they made this bed, rather they put the cover on and left, or someone had recently sat on the bed. Still, kinda scary. The walls had large green spots on them (im unsure of the substance) and the rug had stains all over the place. The walls were filthy, and it was in dire need of a paint job. The whole hotel could use a face lift. Expedia rates this hotel at a 2.5 star level, I personally saw it more as a 1 star. The staff was generally nice, but not the most helpful. The location is ok, not too far from everything. To no fault of the hotel, every morning a guy with a jack hammer was digging in the concrete out front. I didnt sleep more than 5 hourse the whole time. If your looking for a cheap, 1 star type place, this may be for you. But, I suggest you spend $30 or so more dollars and stay at the double tree around the corner. I stayed there for the second leg of my trip and loved it.

<Content>Bad Customer Service I have traveled to over a hundred countries, in the last 30 years, and have stayed at many hotels. This hotel has many problems. The elevators take 10 mins to get, if you are on a high floor even with their express service. The hotel staff are rude and incompetent. I was charged not only once but 3 times for my room. It took 3 trips to the front desk to fix the problem. I have stayed at Ohana Hotels before and had no problems, I will never stay at this one again.

<Content>Overrated The hotel is an accessible location fifteen minutes from the airport. As stated in other reviews, there are decent amenities including pool, jacuzzi, two bars including TGI Friday's if you savor the idea of flying 4000 miles to eat at a chain restaurant. Parking is fine, although the spaces would be tight if you were driving an SUV or large sedan. Prices are low--the thing that annoyed me most about this place, however, is that they attempt to nickel and dime you for every imaginable item. Want to use the safe? Three bucks a day. Coffee packet? Two bucks. Local call? 99 cents. Budget roadside motels give all of this stuff away...I was also a bit disconcerted by the presence of a large stain on the curtain that was entirely consistent with old blood. Seems like they could have taken three coffee packets worth of charges and bought a new curtain.

<Content>Great Place To Stay!!! This hotel was nice and cozy. I like the way the shower curtain went around in a angle. After flying for 6 hours I was very tired when I arrived. The staff was very helpful and full of smiles. Just a sight for sore eyes when you are dead tired. I would agree about the elevator being slow. For some reason I had to swipe my key in the elevator a couple of times before it finally stopped on my floor. Other than that the stay was excellent and the room was spotless. It is a excellent deal for the money. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good Value, Great Views We stayed here for 5 days in May. It was not our first hotel, we had booked at the Ohana Royal Islander. However, after one night we couldn't take the noise from the traffic. We went for a walk and ended up here. It was the same rate as the other hotel, but 100 X cleaner and quieter. We were on the 34th floor and had a beautiful view of the city and partial ocean. The rooms were extremely clean. The elevators seemed slow, but honestly I don't think we ever waited more than 4 or 5 minutes. We enjoyed the location, a little off the path of all the other hotels but still close enough to walk anywhere. My only complaint is that our room was considered a kitchenette. However, there was only a few cracked plates and some dirty silverware in a sticky cupboard, a small fridge and smaller sink. If you had been planning to make use of the kitchenette (which we were not), it would have been quite frustrating.

<Content>Its a nice place for the money u pay. TGI Fridays downstairs,the lobby is great! I was really surprised...I was not expecting such a nice place. There is a TGI Fridays downstairs,the lobby is great! Also there is a computer lab with internet acces, a bar, a pool, a hot tub, and many other amenities. The people that work there are so nice and helpful... the rooms are kept in good conditions, the AC works great (a little noisy). I recommend this place!
