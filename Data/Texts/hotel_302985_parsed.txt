<Content>Excellent place for a honeymoon Great place for a honeymoon; this place is a wilderness palace with lots of modern amenities. We had a pool villa for two nights, and also got the romantic candle-light dinner. We appreciated the smiling faces, beautiful views and pool, and spacious rooms. THey also had free internet access, which could be particularly useful in a pinch. The staff was extremely amenable. We chose to watch the sunrise on Mount Batur, and we had to leave very early in the morning (3 AM). Despite this, the staff put together an amazing boxed breakfast and had tea and coffee waiting for us in the lobby area. When the internet would not work, they sent an engineer to come and help us get it fixed. The room came with a surround sound entertainment system. The place had a different vibe than our previous place, the Laguna in Nusa Dua -- being that it was out in the jungle, it was much more green, but also more buggy. Bugs were everywhere, but I must say they did a pretty good job of pest control overall. The shower and tub are outdoors, which is cool, but not if you're trying to avoid all life forms while bathing. The candlelight dinner was pretty good -- the food was good (except we didn't really have a taste for native indonesian food...but the spring rolls were some of the best we've had). They set up a very formal dinner set (with chair covers included) and we had a private waiter (who came and went), along with our own balinese musicians. Overall the place was great. We also found that our friend, Dewa, was very helpful -- [-]

<Content>My second visit and I'd love to go back! I booked this hotel for the second time through LuxuryLink.com and I had a most relaxing four-day stay at the Pita Maha. Service is impeccable and the staff most gracious. Breakfast at the terrace never failed to disappoint. The individual villas allow for time to relax and meditate. Be sure to experiment with the different fruit juices recommended by your server. I'd go back to this resort again in a heartbeat.

<Content>terrible esp compared to other hotels What can I say? It has been a terrible experience when compared with Uma Ubud. The hotel is run down, ants in the room, the doors are not shutting properly.The food is expensive and pretty average. The swimming pool is old and shabby (I have mentioned this theme already...).Do not go. Your money is better spent elsewhere.

<Content>It blew us away Myself and my husband stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon. We were picked up at the airport and for the journey were provided with hot towels and cold bottled water. It took about an hour to get from Depensar to Ubud, and we were relieved after having travelled in India, that the roads were good and the driver wasnt a maniac! It was dark when we pulled into the driveway of the Pita Maha and so didnt really cop a good look at the outside, but when we walked in through reception, i felt like crying. It was so totally gorgeous, unlike anywhere we have stayed before. The staff were imediately there to welcome us, wher we got further hot towels and a welcome drink. They also gave a present each which was a pita maha sarong (needed for trips to the temples).We checked in very quickly and were being taken to our villa within about 15 minutes. The villa we stayed in was so beautiful. It was a one bedroom villa with a plunge pool and it was large. It had a gorgeous outdoor bathroom, which they had decorated with flower petals in the shape of a love heart a HUGE bed with massive pillows and lovely crisp cotton sheets. It was dark so we couldnt really see the view, but in the morning we were both godsmaked. The villa had the most amazing view out over the River Oos. We could see the rice paddies from our villa, and the wonderful tree's and plants and birds, and of course the gekho's. The Pita Maha has a very good restaraunt with a good choice of dishes at reasonable prices, although there are lots of other better places to eat in Ubud. We went to Cafe Lotus which is a very good location, overlooking a lotus pond(hence the name) and a temple. The food is nice and the service is excellent. We also tried Cafe Wayan who do an excellent chicken curry with steamed rice. Nomad is also a good one to go to. We went during the day and sat on the comfey cushions on the floor. They do a good range of food and good prices and the staff are remarkebly friendly. The Pita Maha is a very short cab ride into the centre of Ubud, but the hotel does a complimentary shuttle bus which runs from and to ubud every hour. If you miss the bus all you have to do is ask the restaraunt to call The hotel and they come and pick you up! On check out we were both given another present each. I was given a lovely hand carved wooden box with the date and Pita Maha on the back, and my husband was given a magnificant hand carved wooden door header with his full name writen on it. I thought this was so personal and we were both really touched. We loved staying here and it will definatlely come back, perhaps next year for our anniversary!

<Content>Like another world I am late to the game, as I stayed in this hotel two years ago (but just joined TA). I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to leave a review. I have vacationed in Bali probably 10 times, and this is the hotel that holds a special place in my heart. I took my Mom and sister there, who were visiting me in Singapore from Texas, and they were absolutely blown away. We stayed at the Ritz first, and they thought that couldn't be beat, but from the moment we stepped into the lobby, with all the carvings and the huge vase of ulu pandan (which smells wonderful, I';ve probably misspelt it), it was magic. We had booked two of the regular villas, but were upgraded to two pool villas. The villas were extremely spacious, the outdoor bathrooms were too cool with amazing detail, and the whole ambiance of the place was spectacular. If you like big chain hotels with huge lobbies, marble bathrooms, and snob appeal, then perhaps this wouldn't be your cup of tea. But if you want luxury and a real (but perhaps idealized) view of Bali and the wonderful Balinese people, than this is your place.

<Content>Amazing..... We had a booking at our usual Ubud haunt at the Tjampuhan and when we arrived we were told that the hotel was full and that we had been upgraded to their sister hotel, PIta Maha. I was not really familiar with the Pita Maha and was a little sceptical as have been sent to poor hotels in the past when dicovering our booked hotel is full but agreed to have a look - WOW!! We found majestic individual villas all seperately walled and private. Fantastic tropical architecture and attention to detail. Nice little touches like arrangements of flowers on each bed and overhanging mosquito nets - which I think were more for the look than to actually keep out those pesky insects. The outside bathroom was fabulous and it was so refreshing to shower outside. There was a gorgeous infinity pool a short below with fabulous views of the valley and river. The shuttle bus service to town was fine and we had no problems locating the bus or having to wait for long periods of time.If only I knew that Mozaic was just across the road and I would have made sure I dined there as I have heard about the reputation of this restaurant.The breakfasts were very nice and included in our upgrade. We had actually booked 3 rooms at the Tjampuhan and received 3 seperate villas at Pita Maha - inlcuding a seperate villa for the 3 kids (6-15) - and they all felt so special having their own magnificent villa - next to ours of course so we were nearby.In all a great experience and for the price we paid (US$80 ish) - AMAZING VALUE!!!! I just wish we'd booked our stay in Ubud for more than the 2 nights.Our friends who also stayed there with us dined at the Terrace restaurant and were not impressed - poor service and average food for the excessive price charged but they wore that due to the amazing upgrade we got and the overall quality of the place. Didn't use the spa villa.Would definately stay there agin if we got the chance....As for the review by the Dubai fella bagging the place - you've been staying at too many fake ski resorts in the desert mate!!! I don't know how anyone could dislike this place!Highly recommended!!!

<Content>Serene and beautiful If you're expecting snooty, high-gloss, modern luxury hotel living, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for a peaceful, very Balinese feel with a more natural, outdoorsy kind of pure luxury, the Pita Maha Resort and Spa is the perfect place.Our villa was atmospheric and spotlessly clean, with tons of space and intricate carvings everywhere. The bed was large and comfortable. The main room had an air-conditioner, though we hardly needed it because of the tall Balinese-style ceiling and the ceiling fans. Being there in summer, we did enjoy the private plunge pool (it's cold because the water is fresh spring water, piped through a fountain made of stacked stone frogs).The villas are built into a hillside, so from your own garden area you have nice vistas out across to rice paddies on the other side of the river gorge. However, this also means there are lots of steps to and from the villas and the main house. For us, this added to the atmosphere - you can't be in a hurry - and why would you want to be, with the gamelan music drifting through the air and the trickle of the fountains and the frangipani and hibiscus blooms at every step?It's a nice touch that the spa villa is booked in two-hour increments. You have the entire spa to yourself after your treatment, so you can enjoy the whirlpools and the spa's own infinity pool that looks out over the river valley in total privacy.Plus the staff made our stay even more worthwhile, treating us as if we were the only people at the resort. They quickly learned our preferences and truly anticipated our every need. If you are going for your anniversary or other special occasion, be sure to tell them - the petal and floral arrangements they left in our room on our anniversary night were a highlight.

<Content>Best Hotel Ever We had six days at the Pita Maha, please note there are several sister hotels also (Royal PitaMaha, Pita Maha Tehpujan? spelt something like that) the Pita Maha Resort my husband and I stayed at is a 24 villa property.The moment we were picked up from our Seminjak hotel for the trip to Ubud we knew we were in for something special, great luxury car, cold drinks for the journey, information brochure and the scenic route taken for our pleasure.We were upgraded to a deluxe villa which was just the best, we were getting married in our villa the next day and they really didnt have to but they gave us the best villa in the place at no additional charge to us. The rooms - mini houses really - are cleaned twice a day, loads of free bottled water, fruit, nuts, fresh ground coffe, coffee maker, flowers everywhere, more fluffy white towels and robes than you can count, silent air conditioning, full dvd library to borrow free of charge, dvd player with surround sound in each room, our own safe to place valuables. The rooms are amazing, thatching, marble floors, beautiful carved wood furniture, the most luxurious bed linen, everything was perfect. Outside garden and pool just amazing a tropical paradise, stone carving everywhere, mature trees, secluded and private. Breakfast was included in our deal, anything off the extensive menu, which was some of the best food we have eaten, especially our wedding dinner. The restaurant has the most fabulous veiws over the gorge, misty in the early hours and slowly clears while you enjoy your breakfast. The Staff were brilliant, they bent over backward and were so professional. My husband had developed a sore ear and we needed to get to a chemist, they said as soon as we finished our breakfast they would be happy to take us. Not only did we get taken free of charge they picked us up an hour later after having seen a doctor and gotten medication, with no mention of further charge, this was the professional way of Pita Maha,. The staff always reminded us when we were dropped into Ubud at night on the Pita Maha free shuttle bus, (running to and from hotel to Ubud to Monkey Forest from 0900 to 2200hrs) that if we could not make the shuttlepick up then ask the restaurant to ring the hotel and they would come and pick us up within 10 minutes. The entire stay was more like being taken care of by the most understanding friends than being in a hotel and I cannot recommend the Pita Maha more highly and cannot wait to return.

<Content>Old shabby and run down We arrived on July 10th 2007. It was old, run down, kitch and generally not what luxury travellers would expect. The staff were fairly arrogant and not the most welcoming team. We were shown to our villa which we had booked for $250 per night, for 3 night stay, which included an upgrade to a Pool Villa. The villa had an old bed with a matress which dipped in the middle, the pool was very average with no heating, so freezing cold and when we looked out to the view we noticed that garbage had been thrown over the edge and was filling up the hillside under the villa. Not what you expect in a five star hotel. Clearly the royal family which owns the property has lost all intertest in this hotel. Its going to a slow death. Not a place for special occasions, luxury travellers, spa goers or anyone with high expectations and taste. After explaining to the lady who showed us to the villa, that this was not suitable, we were upgraded to Royal Pita Maha. Check out my review of that.

<Content>An amazing Hotel We stayed at the Pita Maha for 4 nights in May as part of our honeymoon and it was easily the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Each of the individual walled villas were huge, beautiful and really private. We really liked the huge windows over looking the valley and the outside bathroom.The staff at the hotel were so friendly and visited the room throughout the day to replace towels, water and flowers. The shuttle into Ubud was really useful and although it was meant to operate hourly they would take you whenever you asked. I wouldn't advise using the hotel to book a driver though as they are so much more expensive than in Ubud.We also had a lulur spa treatment which was amazing - a massage, body scrub and soak in a flower filled outside jacuzzi plus dinner at the hotels restaurant - really good value.There is an amazing restaurant opposite the hotel called Mosaic. It is really expensive (for Bali) but worth it. You have to book ahead and it is shut on Mondays.We would definately stay there again.

<Content>A beautiful hotel with lots of character! My husband and I stayed in Pita Maha Resort and Spa for 3 nights in Feb 07. This was after reading the excellent reviews. We were not disappointed and it lived up to all our expectations. The hotel was tranquil, village like with Balinese architecture at its best. We had a garden villa. I loved the private garden with its pool where we had afternoon tea and local cakes. The beautiful public infinity pool is also very quiet. Don't miss the early breakfast in the restaurant with personal service and serene hillside view. The hotel also has transport service to Ubud town which is nearby, offering plenty of cultural shopping. We shall be back soon!

<Content>Loved this place! We stayed at Pita Maha for 4 days in September 2006. We didn't want to stay in those busy touristic areas at the Balinese coast. And Pita Maha in Ubud was the right choice. It is about an hour drive from the airport and pick-up and return by the hotel is included in the room price. We were welcomed at the airport with nice cold bottles of water and during our drive to Ubud the driver provided us with written touristic information.The hotel is very nicely located at a hill site and the location is really quiet. The hotel consists of 24 very spacious villa's with all facilities you want. These rooms are very private in their own walled garden. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Every 30 minutes a small hotel bus brings you to the village or picks you up. They also can bring you to the starting point of nice walks trough the surrounding hills and rice fields.We had a totally relaxing and enjoyable stay.

<Content>Pita Maha is perfect - we'll be back! Just returned from a week at Pita Maha celebrating our 20th anniversary. We picked the resort based on Tripadvisor's ratings. From the moment we arrived, we were overwhelmed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff (or should I say friends, because that's what many of them became). Because there are only 24 villas (and God knows how many staff), it is much easier for the staff to get to know you well.The villas are around 16 years old, but don't let this put you off. All of the stone has weathered beautifully and there is no aluminium or plastic anywhere. And, of course, the views from the very private villas are outstanding.House restaurant is exceptional and reasonable - alternatively, try Mozaic just across the road, it's one of the very best retaurants in the world.

<Content>Not great..sorry! We were a little disappointed by this hotel after having read the reviews beforehand. Perhaps we had been spoilt by Damai villas or maybe it was the fact that although the villa was beautiful, it truly had a very musty/damp smell to it which was particulary noticable when we first arrived and at night, as during the day you could open all the doors to let it air...maybe it was the traditional balinese roofing. Whatever it was, it just didn't feel right as the villa made us feel it hadn't been used much over the last few months. The views from the villa we felt, were also a little disappointing. We spent 3 nights here and had one meal at the hotel..it wasn't great...we far more preferred our meal in town at Ibu Rai's and Casa Luna's, which also happened to cost a fraction of the price! We will not go back and really felt it was far to expensive for what it was.

<Content>Pita Maha, loved it. We started our honeymoon in Bali at Pita Maha. What a beautiful place, secluded, great views, lovely rooms, and a traditional feel. We stayed in a pool villa which looked out onto tropical woodland.The staff were fantastic, and service great. The food I would say, was just ok to be honest. We had breakfast included which was delivered to our pavilion every morning when we requested, and was brilliant, but the two main meals we had were average. I must mention at this point though a restaurant just opposite called mozaic. I booked in advance, (advisable) They had found out it was our honeymoon and gave us a great private table. The food was exquisite, but expect to pay a bit more than normal. Having said that we went back for more.Both places mentioned made us feel very special on our honeymoon, and I would strongly recommend them both.Whitmores from London.

<Content>Excellent! My partner and I stayed in Pita Maha for 3 nights in August 2005. This was after staying in Nusa Dua for 6 nights and to be the luxury part of our holiday. We wished we skipped Nusa Dua altogether and just spent all our time at Pita Maha.The driver picked us up from our hotel in a nice 4wd. 15 minutes into our journey he pulled over and got us both cold washers and chilled water from an ice box in the back of our car.Upon arriving at the hotel we were told the villa wouldn't be ready for about 1 hour. While disappointed, we were told about a regular shuttle into Ubud every hour, we caught that and had a look around the town. You can also request a shuttle to nearby destinations outside of this timetable. Our villa was absolutely gorgeous. The extra expense of getting a pool villa is worth it. The villas are private, with large outdoor gardens with sun lounges and the view... you can't describe how stunning it is. We felt extremely spoilt.The breakfast was superb (no buffet dining here, straight off the menu!). All the staff were extremely friendly. The food is great. I would recommend eating there, while it is expensive restaurant food, it is comparable to any meal i've had in australia. We ate it room service, which was delivered by a waiter, and he set all the cutlery and dishes up in our living area so we felt like we were eating out in a restaurant anyhow, great food and stunning views.The resort is small, so you don't see other guests too often. The hotel pool is amazing, and worth swimming in just to see the view.... We loved this place and it really made our holiday.

<Content>Spa-rkling! I spent part of my honeymoon in a lovely garden villa with pool, spacious and private set in a lush valley overlooking paddy fields. We enjoyed wonderful service and relaxing spa treatments which were very affordable. We enjoyed a varied menu every night and could not fault the service.The staff even invited us to join them in their temple celebration, sharing the amazing food and making us feel so welcome.My wife cried when we had to leave to go to Oberoi Lombok (which was very disappointing in comparison to Pita Maha!).........why did we leave!!I'm not one for going back to holiday destinations but this I would thoroughly recommend to anyone...try it....love it!!
