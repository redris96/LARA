<Content>Ignore the negative reviews Just had 8 days in Hong Kong staying at the Silvermine. I paid around 拢35 a night for what I could call a very nice, relaxing hotel that I could not fault in any way.I was a little put off by some of the reviews on distances to Hong Kong and other areas but I feel that was unfair but maybe a consideration if you have a young family, babies, etc and therefore a lot of baggage. As I travelled on my own I would totally recommend this place to any single traveller or couples thinking of staying somewhere reasonable and a welcome retreat from the noise, pollution and chaos that is Hong Kong.I nearly paid 拢100 more for a place in Kowloon which was basically a run down apartment block just to be in the area and have access to the attractions, etc. I wouldn't bother, as you probably have already read from other reviews, the ferry terminal is a good 5 minute walk from the Silvermine and is so regular, you could set your watch by them. Believe me, after a days sightseeing and moving around, it is great to come back to a very peaceful and tranquil location - so quiet I was sleeping all through the night and refreshed every morning. I was up every morning at 7 for breakfast just to ensure that I made the most of the day. HK and Kowloon are fab, but I'm glad I didn't stay in the area as it was very noisy and where else can you come back to your hotel, get into your swimming shorts and go for a swim and relax by the pool with your book.Breakfast was fab, with a full range of cooking items, juices, cereals, toast, bread, yoghurts to satisfy any palate and was included in the price. I would take a glass of juice onto the beach after brekkie just for a breather before venturing out.Island locals? Very friendly, no problems here. Quiet at night and the island was great. As other reviews have stated, there is a nice pub (little expensive), McDs and a 7/11 convenience store on the island right by the ferry and bus terminus. (7/11s are in abundance in HK and Kowloon - always good to keep the fluid levels replenished as the weather was of a good temperature) In general, people were friendly, met some nice locals/tourists and had a great time. Cleaning? Every day and a card was put under my door when I forgot to take off the 'Do not disturb sign' from my door as they were concerned that the room was not cleaned.Cooked Food Markets on the island. OK so they don't look the most modern or cleanest but the service/food and beer was top notch and much cheaper than some of the classier upmarket diners. Totally recommend the Cooked Food Markets as you leave the ferry terminal.Transportation to/from hotel. I got a taxi in for luxury/ease after coming off the 11 hour flight which cost me $150HKD which worked out to be about 拢12 GBP. If you prrefer the bus then its about $21.7 HKD which is 拢2.50. Either way, its a bargain but the taxi is more convenient although they do drive a bit fast.Octopus Card - recommended totally, so easy to recharge and use on most of the transport around the city (MTR, Bus, Ferry - even to pay for groceries in the 7/11) $150 HKD for a card with 拢100 prepay and then recharge in $50 and above amounts. I do realise that a lot of this information has already been repeated in other reviews but this is my side of the trip and the areas that I feel were outstanding.All in all, HK was very good to me and I thoroughly recommend the Silvermine.Tim

<Content>Silvermine Bay is beautiful A nice hotel in a very nice place. Ferry terminal is a 5 minute walk with the journey around 45 minutes to the city. Staff very friendly and our room was clean and well maintained. Good standard and variety at breakfast. 'Mountain View' is a lie,however, we overlooked a building site.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, friendly staff Stayed for4 nights. Was a great hotel, lovely large room with good facilities. The main hotel was under construction so was covered in scaffolding but this didn't really interferewith my stay. Lovely pool, which was probably the only place you noticed the construction.Great location directly opposite the beach.Good varied breakfast and really good value buffet main meals.Staff very friendly and helpful.Would stay again.

<Content>I like this Little Old Hotel Silvermine Bay is a BEAUTIFUL bay at the Mui Wo area (the other end of the island) of Lantau. It is secluded, quaint, and clean town. In the middle of it is the Silvermine Hotel, facing the beach. The staff is quite friendly, helpful and try to accomodate you. The food is so-so. The room is tiny but sufficient and the little things they provide for the guests are plenty. The other building was still being renovated and we were billeted in a separate building still w/ great ocean or mountain view.Sometimes one does not have to stay in a grand place to feel rich.It's definitely a serene respite from the hustle and bustle of Hongkong and Kowloon.

<Content>Old and Rundown This hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport (an extra $300 HKD for taxis both ways). We specifically checked and was told there was a shuttle - there is not. Internet was also not included in the rate and it was an additional $80 HKD per day. The room was ancient and rundown. It was indeed clean as much as one could clean it but it was pretty bad. They are renovating the place and boy does it need it. I was really happy that I only had to spend a few hours at this place. The only redeeming feature was that it was cheap. You do get what you pay for.

<Content>Nice hotel, relaxing area We stayed at the Silvermine Beach Hotel in Mui Wo on Lantau Island in Hong Kong for 2 nights in August 2008. I was in Hong Kong for work but wanted a few days to unwind, and the Silvermine Beach area was perfect for this. This area of Lantau is very tranquil to due a restriction on vehicles, but we found cabs and buses very easy to use. The hotel was in a nice area for walking around, and we took a bus to Ngong Ping to ride the cable car to the top of the hill, and took another bus to Cheung Sha beach. Both are recommended.I would recommend this hotel for a few days of getaway, but no more, as there isn't much to do in this area.

<Content>Loved Silvermine Beach and Mui Wo! This hotel gave us the best ending to our 3 week trip around China. The staff and the food are great. They are doing some maintenance on the building currently (which is desperately needed). The 'new' block is better but the rooms I saw were not that much better than the main block - check your room before checking in - the first one they gave us looked out over rusting air-con ducts and rubble. Once you get past that though the place is really great. The staff are friendly, from the front desk and serving staff to the management - all are really keen to help and make you feel welcome. The chef is really good - especially their big buffets with loads of amazing seafood and barbecues. They lay on entertainment in the bar even when there are only a few guests about. The pool is really nice and was very clean. The sauna and steam room were good too and it was great to be able to use the private showers to get ready for the airport if your plane is a late one (a bus runs direct to the airport from just round the corner). The beach at Mui Wo (Silvermine Bay) is lovely and the hotel is right opposite. A great stay! - but check around on the internet for a good rate - we paid way way below the rate advertised at the hotel.

<Content>ehhhh... We chose the silvermine because it is the closest hotel the airport... aside from the Regal airport hotel, but that one is really expensive. Due to flight cancelations, we had to stay in hong kong one more night so we wanted to go with something cheap and close by. It is a really cute place and the staff was really nice. Unfortunately the place itself is VERY run down and old. Its surroundings are beautiful, especially for nature seekers. Really calm and pretty. The hotel is right in front of the beach- if they renovated it, it would be awesome!! All in all, if you want to save money, this place works... but it is certainly not anything luxurious.

<Content>Not good for the money you pay! This Hotel was in a nice location in the bay. In general the hotel is average!! And it is not worth for the money you pay. It is in a very remote location and ideal for Honeymoon couples looking out for a calm location... I paid 133US$ for a non-bay facing room for a night stay (on the Christmas Eve). I found the following issues with the Hotel 1. No lift. You have to carry all ur luggage through the spring door all the way to ur room without any one's help. the manager offered me a help which i said No Thanks...2. The bathroom doesnt have a exhaust fan. Imagine after using the toilet...3. The bathtub doesnt have a lid.4. AC dont have temperature control. You can just control the speed of fan.5. No complimentry breakfast.6. You need to pay extra for the internet. Bottom line the rooms are very old and doesn't match the standards, for the cost you pay. I dint expect these issues for a hotel which is rated above average.

<Content>On the beach Me and my boyfriend stayed over for one night on the way back from Big Buddha at Lan Tau. If you only stay in business class hotels and expect luxury then this place is not for you. It had a very 70's feel.The hotel room was large but very old fashioned and basic, smelt of stale smoke and the whole hotel seemed a little run down but it was clean, had large windows, a comfy bed with a great view of the beach and we loved it. It is right on a beautiful beach and brilliant value for money, the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was buffet service, with lots of choiceThe beach was quite empty during the day, bar some locals. The area is very nice to have a walk around and is very handy for the ferry about a 5 minute walk. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Lovely and Peaceful We stayed here for 2 nights on a stopover from London to Sydney. We booked here as it was considerably cheaper than anything in Kowloon or HK Island.We travelled to the hotel by taxi as we arrived quite late. Taxi's are easy to locate outside of the airport. Only blue ones can go to Lantau Island so make sure you get one of these. Taxi cost approx HK$140 and took about 30 mins.We stayed in a South Wing Sea View room and it was fine, although please note there are no lifts in the hotel. Bed was nice and comfy, air con, internet access (for a charge) and TV. Bathroom was fine - everything you needed. We ordered some food and it was a little pricey but we were too tired to venture out.View was spectacular! We arrived at night so had no idea until we opened the curtains. Simply amazing! Breakfast was good - hot food, cereal, toast, dim sum and noodles. To get to city you can get the ferry - terminal is about 10 minute walk. Ferry is cheap and takes between 30/45mins. You dock on HK island side, near Central station. Last ferry back is just before midnight.We like this hotel as it was away from the hustle and bustle and we saw more of HK than the skyscrapers. We didn't use any facilities or even look around as we spent most of the 2 days in the city. I think it's ideal for a short stopover.TOP TIP - You can check in your luggage at Central station (and another one I think). We did this so were luggage free for our 2nd day. You just need to purchase an airport express ticket to get through to the counters. Make sure your airline offers this service first. There's also a luggage locker service at Central and this cost HK$50 for the day -perfect for hand luggage.

<Content>In need of complete refurbishment. Oh dear Oh dear, just spent 5 days 4 nights at this Hotel. First the good points, The staff are very helpful and friendly and the room is cleaned and bedding and towels changed every day.The Buffet breakfast is good value.The bad points, the hotel is so badly run down. It is in need of a complete refurbishment, it needs completely re-decorating and new bathrooms fitted.There is a lounge where you can have a drink but the bar is in the dinning room so when you require a refill you have to go in search of a member of staff which starts to get a bit tirersome.The swimming pool, although the water is clean the pool is in need of refurbishment, when tiles in the pool become dislodged they just cement in the space, it looks a mess, and no one makes any effort to clean the leaves and bits of rubbish out of the pool.This hotel could be really good if only they spend some money on doing it up.

<Content>Fantastic location This is rated as a 3 star hotel and on that basis I rate it above average. It is easy to get to from the airport, it's right on the beach and great to return to after a hard day exploring Kowloon and Hong Kong. The view from our room was spectacular and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately we didn't have time to use the pool in the 4 days we were there. I do agree with everyone else that the building is in bad need of some TLC and if the owners spent some time and money on it it could easily be upgraded. If you are looking for some nightlife the hotel doesn't seem to draw many people into the bar at night. They had a pianist and singer but each of the 3 evenings we went in to use the free internet there were only one or two people in there. Overall I would definitely stay at the Silvermine Hotel again for the location and friendliness.

<Content>Nice cosy hotel, ideal for exploring Lantau island Nice hotel, kept clean and run by friendly staff. We stayed in the most recent building and got free upgrade to the beach view room.Room are quite basic and with old furniture and quite old carpet and curtains, but good enough. No in-room safe.Breakfast was included and was of buffet type. The hot meals choice was however extended but not varied in the full week. Mui Wo is good base for visiting Lantau island and the offshore islands too. The village has nice beaches with shark protection nets and has some local attraction too (e.g. waterfall). So it is good in itself for swimming and walking activities.

The owners don鈥檛 appear to have spent any money on the place in quite a few years so the d茅cor is tired, the pool, etc need tidying up, the bathrooms need modernising. It鈥檚 such a shame as this hotel is in a great location and with a bit of investment could market itself as a 4 star hotel.鈥?Bathroom smelt of drains and there was black mould growing in the grout around the bath.鈥?There is only one ferry per hour into Central. The last ferry back to Silvermine is at 0030, so forget this hotel if you are a night owl and want to stay out late in Kowloon / Central.

<Content>Great View I did not really know what to expect when I stayed at the Silvermine Beach Hotel so many mixed reports, yes when I walked up to the Hotel it looked like it could do with a lick of paint, but I have to say that when I opened the room door I was more then happy. The room was in the old wing with a sea view the room was a lot larger and brighter then the Newton Hotel Hong Kong where I had stayed twice before.The room had a view to kill for looking out of the large widow (about 8 foot wide) it was just a matter of a few feet to the clean sandy beach with a number trees growing on it and clean water lapping on the sand. As I had a corner room it had another large window to the side with another view of the beach and the new hotel wing.The staff as all the reviews say are friendly and helpful and speak enough English to get by.The cleanliness of the room was fine but was let down by the bathroom that did have black mould around the bath and did smell musty.The breakfast was more then adequate to start you day. To summarise the view alone form my room is worth a fortune and just a lick of paint would restore the building to it鈥檚 former Art Deco splendour.

<Content>Not very exciting honestly Lantau island is pretty amazing, extremely beautiful tropic misty greenery mountains paradise heaven. Shame that Silvermine Resort just don't match all this beauty level.First of all - to reach any destination on Lantau island by taxi from HK Airport is relatively fast  pleasant but only light-blue taxis are allowed within the island so ask taxis reception stand clerk at airport taxis parking to call for light-blue car as they are very few and you even don't spot any at taxis parking - only red  green ones (prohibited to go to Lantau).Hotel located on bay beach which is quite small  almost no space for bathing. The building  rooms are dreadfully shabby  outdated, you don't feel any relaxing vacation pleasure from this place. Sincerely I was a beat shocked how worn-out  low-key it was. I've read reviews on this site before my holidays but they don't reflect all the reality unfortunately. It's better not to behave as total miser, spend $20 more per night  have nice modern accommodation somewhere on HK island - it's not so awfully overcrowded or noisy or something as you may think before visiting HK.Breakfast is not edible, disappointing.However staff in Silvermine is trying noticeably to improve your feelings, they are very helpful  friendly.

<Content>disappointed We stayed here for one night, on a layover on our way back home.We wanted a quiet, clean hotel close to the beach for our last day.It was a long taxi ride from the airport, along a windy road, which made both of us nauseous. The customer service was friendly and helpful, but it didnt make up for the rest of our stay.The hotel and room were run down, we didn't feel clean in the room, and I did not feel it was good value. The free buffet breakfast was horrible, unless you want to settle for cereal.The beach was littered with garbage. There was really nothing to do in Mui Wo.It was a getaway to nothing, really.We wish we had stayed by the airport. By the time we paid for the taxis, and took an hour each way to get there, we could have spent the money on the Novotel Citygate, and been closer to everything.I wanted to like this place. We felt it was a waste of time to stay there. Consider elsewhere.

One or two bits slightly tacky round the edges but you get what you pay for. Room in New Wing clean and functional. Optional buffet very good and staff very friendly and helpful The kids loved the pool we loved the fact is was quiet . Whilst the walk to th ferry was uncomfortablr in hot weather you can get a taxi to 50 yds. Mui wo was ok too All in all Good value for money for a chill out

It was clean and the service was good. The staff are very pleasant and happy to help with anything. The breakfast buffet has everything you need. Its a short walk to the ferry and 35-45 min ferry ride to Central Hong Kong. I stayed here for 2 nights of a 7 day stay in Hong Kong and found it refreshing. Easy access to the Big Buddha by bus.

<Content>Jaded but still nice considering  Well the hotel needs a bit of work. Rooms were not spotless.(basically the headboard needs to be replaced), However!, for the price you get a really good evening buffet for very little extra. It is a beautiful setting. Sitting outside this old hotel in the evening on the most beautiful of settings with a beer in hand redeems the faded grandeur. The staff are very friendly and this is a positive. There is free internet in the bar which is great. Even though it needs a lick of paint I would go back, the setting away from the chaos of HK, redeems it beautifully and the island is simply lovely. You cannot be to hard on a hotel like this because if it was replaced, by god think about what would replace it, I'd say it would ruin the beach front. Basically it aint chain and that is what is nice about it.

<Content>Great place to relax My husband and I just spent 10 days in HK, we stayed in Silvermine beach hotel for the first 5 days. Everyone on the island was really friendly. It's a shame that the property manager hasn't spent more time taking care of the interior of the hotel. We had a garden-view room in the new wing (booked via Expedia), the room size was decent, the bathroom smelled of mildew, it was probably due to proximity to the ocean, the humidity, and lack of ventilation. We could use more towels in the bathroom as well, as they only give you two hand towels and two small bath towels. If you are not picky about stuff like that, you will do just fine.Near the pier, there is a McDonald's, two supermarkets (Park'n Shop, Wellcome), there is also a HSBC bank. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, which I would recommend after a long flight. The ride from the airport to the hotel was not exactly smooth, but not as scary as we had thought, just don't eat a lot prior to the ride if you get car sick quite easily. The walk from the bus stop/pier to the hotel would probably take 7-10 minutes, and not a lot of fun when you have large suitcases to carry/drag. We had visited HK several times in the last few years, and would probably not recommend this place for first time visitors, who want to get a true taste of HK. If you had been to HK in the past, and want to spend part of your vacation away from the city, this is definitely the place. It was easy for us to visit Cheung Chau (rent a bike, HK$25 for half a day, it makes it so much easier for you to get around the island), and getting to Central on the fast ferry was quick and easy ( I would recommend you to print out the ferry schedule ahead of time). We also spent an afternoon digging out clams in the beach and roasted them (along with marinated meat we bought from Park n shop, you can buy all the stuff you need for the BBQ there) in the BBQ area. Overall, the stay at Silvermine beach hotel was pleasant and we would definitely go back, great place to spend a few days, not your full vacation though.

<Content>Service with a smile! Myself and my Girlfirend stayed for 3 nights at the Silvermine only last week. We arrived tired from an early flight from Singapore and arrived at midday at the Silvermine. Any fears of not haing a room available at this time for us to get some much needed sleep were quickly dashed upon arrival. Not only was there a room ready and waiting for us we were also upgraded free of charge to a room in the hotels new wing. Excellent customer service or what!?The room itself was average in size and offered a part view of the beach. Room was clean as was ensuite. Some facilites in room perhaps lacking. No coffee or 'western' teas bags on offer and only limited TV choice.The hotel also had a large swimming pool in its grounds, though we never had chance to use it. Breakfast was inlcuded in price and was overall so-so. Wide range of foods on offer though quality not as good as would have liked.We did eat in their restaurant on our first night and their evening buffet fared a little better than breakfast. The food was of good quality and deal included unlimited beer.Once you have gotten used to the idea of not staying in Central Hong Kong, the location of the Silvermine is handy enough for the towns few attractions. Mo Wui itself is ok. There are a few restaurants (including ubiquitous McDonalds) and shops nearby. Try the local pizzeria restaurant in the town square, excellent food at reasonable prices.Lantau, the island where the Silvermine is located is a bit of a gem. Local buses can be caught from the Centre of Mo Wui to various locations around the island. We went to see the Big Buddah and the monastery which is a must see and also went to Tai-o situated at the far side of the Island. Tai-o is a bit like stepping back in time with its stilted houses and atmospheric market streets - as far removed from Central Hong Kong as you can imagine.Overall the Silvermine provided the foundations for a restful final 3 days to what was a 16 day jaunt to the Far East. Would consider staying again if in the area.

<Content>Cheap value, old-style HongKong I must disagree with another reviewer who says it is cheaper to stay near the airport if you're on a short trip. All the hotels near the airport are more than double the price, so even with a taxi each way HK130 - US$18 it's still better to stay at Silvermines. Book on the Internet for the best price; direct at the hotel you could pay 50% more. Make sure your internet booking includes breakfast, which is really well worth having.Great eating places all around the terminal - you will eat well for HK$30 or less!The A35 bus from the airport gets there in the end, but very slow and infrequent service.Remember that you have to walk a short distance along a pedestrians only roadway to get there, so not good if you have a ton of luggage. Travel light!The best thing about staying here is you can get into HK Central by ferry, in 30 mins, a most memorable experience for only HK$10

<Content>a bargain - will return My husband and I spent five nights in HK - three nights at the Silvermine Beach and two at the Langham in Mongkok. We absolutely loved the Langham and hope to return, Mongkok is a great area and buzzes with energy. The hotel is luxurious, but this is reflected in the price. Silvermine was considerably less expensive (a third of the price I think) and we thought really top value for money. We enjoyed the laid-back feel of Lantau and were impressed by the quick ferry link to HK island (30-40mins). The staff in the hotel are really friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant on the night we arrived (tired and bedragled). It was a buffet style meal, drinks/beers included. We also thought this was excellent value for money and were glad we did it. A lot of the negative remarks for the hotel seem to focus on the decor. We stayed at one of the rooms at the back of the older hotel and were still happy with it (I think the newer block, water facing supposed to be preferable). My husband said it reminded him of some of the Days Inn hotels we have stayed at on our trips to the States - a little dated, but clean and basic.

<Content>Hong Kong Oasis The Silvermine Beach is located about 5 minutes (without luggage) walk from the Mui Wo bus stop (not a mile!!) and ferry terminal - you can see it from the bus station. It does look rather tired from the outside - it is covered in greying white tiles and the letters of the hotel name are a bit scruffy. Inside is much better; reception is clean and tidy and the restaurant is smart and modern.We stayed in the new wing - the room was a standard hotel size, not at all cramped, as was the bathroom. Full bath with over shower, toilet and sink, free toiletries and everything clean and functional. The room had a good if slightly hard double bed, table and two chairs, two bedside tables, big dresser and TV (which costs extra), large wardrobe and a fridge with mini-bar and kettle. A little worn in places but perfectly acceptable.We booked on southeast-asia.com. We asked for an early check-in due to horrible flight times and were delighted that the room was ready at 8am even though official check-in is 2pm. We got a good night's sleep although slight interruption as there appeared to be a herd of elephants in the room next door. The hotel has no adjacent road and you can hear the sea which is across the path. Not sure I'd swim in the bay though.Breakfast is very good - all you can eat buffet with both western and chinese food, and help yourself so take your time. I did see the hotel sauna which is a little tired, and the bar is a bit short on comfortable seats.to get to the buddha is a 50 minute bus ride (same as from Tung Chung). From the airport was an hour there and 45 minutes back - second driver was a chinese Schumacher! Roads on Lantau are narrow and twisting so hold on tight, but buses are very cheap and punctual. Mui Wo has a cash machine, several restaurants and a supermarket.Staff speak English and were very helpful - luggage stored for free in reception until we left at 11pm.I think this is a totally acceptable 3 star hotel and a very good base, and would stay again.

<Content>Quiet ( We stayed here for 2 nights and 2 days at this hotel. We were a party of 3 including a 4 month old infant, on our first ever trip to Hongkong. Personally, I liked the solitude and settings of the hotel, just across a very quiet  lovely beach. Staff was very friendly. We got a room, garden facing, with 2 twin beds. Heater, running hot water and mattress were okay. No complaint about the facilities.They give breakfast coupons for free, with continental buffet type, which is very sumptuous, with wide variety.But, for the first time traveler, this hotel is pretty far away from the airport, about an hours commute by taxi (about $60HKD) and the winding roads (across the hills) are mostly one-way because of the ongoing construction activity. And the hotel entrance is not accessible directly from the wider roads. IF you are carrying luggage (like we did) you have to be prepared to drag them at least for a mile or so from the nearest road that can be accessed by taxi. This was pain, though the hotel management offers trolleys for free and porter service for a cost.Apart from the ferry pier, there isn't much in the island, if you want to get around easily, I would recommend staying somewhere near the airport. Specifically if you are interested in going to the Po Lin monastery (Big Buddha) or tour of Lantau islands, I would recommend staying in Tung Chug, which is a lot closer and easily accessible, though I don't know about the cost.

<Content>Very Jaded A very strange stay- particularly after reading other trip advisor reviews beforehand!!! I don't understand the acceptance of what is a hotel in need of serious work and is not that cheap. In defence of the other advisors their view may have been coloured by Lantau itself. It is such a break form the madness of Hong Kong and highly recommended. And there is pretty much nowhere else to stay!!

Booked half-board and was not disappointed - food excellent.Having stayed in Hong Kong before I would definitely recommend the peace and quiet of Lantau - watch out for bikesBikes are in abundance - everyone has one and they are everywhere!!The buzz of the city is only a thirty minute ferry journey away .The Hotel itself is spotless a lick of paint would make it perfect.Will definitely return.

<Content>really impressed I am back packing and Hong Kong was my first stop. After seeing the usual places offered to backpackers and the prices of hotels in hong kong I picked the silvermine hotel. I am so glad I did. Mui Wo is a lovely little village with enough restaurants etc to keep you entertained in the evening. The ferry is a 5 min walk away and then it takes 30mins into central which is in the middle of the city. It costs 220HKD each way which is about 1.70 GBP. I saw Chunkking and Mirador mansions and am so glad I am staying here. The only bad thing is that it is difficult to meet other people so may be better for couples.

<Content>Better Than We Expected, We Would Do It Again We have just returned from a four day stay at this hotel, we were doing this on the cheap so booked the cheapest room rate. Thanks to all the previous reviews we felt we booked this hotel, knowing not to expect too much. After asking to have our first room changed (2nd floor inside view), because of strong smell of cigarette smoke. We were moved immidiatly to a much better room on the 3rd floor outside view. Yes it is dated and jaded, but clean enough and spacious, lots of hot water, and with a bit of flexible thinking could have a decent breakfast.The area is very quiet a complete contrast to Hong Kong and Kowloon.We decided to use the airport bus hk$23 on a weekend half the cost in the week.We would book this hotel again.

<Content>A reasonable place to stay This place was adequate for us for two nights. Clean and simple.It's a short (safe) walk from the bus depot, but it does take about 45min from the airport to Silvermine Bay on the steep windy road.The restuarant is OK, and the breakfast is very good and free.The gym is small but quite usable, with some dumbells and machines.The pool was being used for a TV shoot so we couldn't use it.A lot of the hotel is under construction, but we found it generally OK.They wanted a fortune for the deposit on the Internet Modem, but you can get free net (fast) in the bar if you buy a drink.You could certainly do a lot worse than staying here.

<Content>A Breath of Fresh Air in Hong Kong This Hotel was perfect for my needs. OK, it is a little bit in disrepair in places. It is clean though and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The walk to the taxi at 5.00am in the morning, with cases etc., is a bit of a pain, but only takes 5 minutes. I will return to Hong Kong soon and will certainly be staying here again.I have stayed in downtown Hong Kong on many occasions, but this place is a quiet oasis in an otherwise loud,brash bustling place.And the bonus is, Central Hong Kong is only 30 minutes away by ferry.Recommend this hotel if you want to experience the best that Hong Kong has to offer, but would like to come back, at night, to a little peace and quiet.Good pub in the town too.

<Content>What a shame Perfect location for a hotel, but what a shame that parts of this hotel have fallen into disrepair. We had a wonderful sea view, which was useful as the view of the room was shocking, mould and damp all around and the bathroom, oh dear, dear, dear, what a shame.Staff were mostly helpful, Restaurant better than room but sadly the food was a bit dodgy.Sauna and Steam room were both excellent and free.If you want to visit Hong Kong (and please do not go with thoughts of how it used to be) and you don't wish to stay in the hub bub of either Kowloon or HK island then this location is a great alternative only half an hour by fast ferry.I recommend taking a taxi as some of the bus drivers on Lantau are disappointed rally drivers still trying for the round the island record.Seriously Silvermine is not great, but if you expect little then try it out, the new wing may be better than the old wing though.

<Content>Decent hotel but location might prove a problem for some Stayed in the new wing (March 3rd - March 5th) but didn't get a look of the old rooms to compare. Room was clean, decent size and bed was western size though fairly firm. Got a sea view which was more of a side view but still salt water was within my panorama. Tea/coffee making facilities but no actual tea or coffee (bit odd). Bathroom fairly standard with the customary Hong Kong high pressure shower. Every shower I've used in Hong Kong blasts water at you which certainly wakes you up.Buffet breakfast was good. Quite a variety which changed a bit on the 2nd day so you wouldn't get too bored. A bit greasy (typically eggs, sausage, baked beans, hamburger, samosa) but there's cornflakes, toast and fruit for those who are health concious. Fresh tea and coffee available aswell fresh juice (I assume from concentrate). Forgot to mention but there's noodles too as a hot food choice.The area is very quiet. Poor man's version of Stanley without the market is how I would describe it. Within a 5 minute walk there's McDonald's and 7-11. Getting to the Silvermine proved to be our biggest problem. Waited at the bus stop outside the airport for nearly an hour and then some bus driver pulls up but only to tell us that there has been a crash and route is suspended until further notice. What should have been a cheap 60 minute journey turned into a 3 hour expensive detour via the airport express to Hong Kong station and then trying to find the ferry pier. All this is with our heavy luggage.Perhaps I would stay there again, hotel is fine but location makes it awkward.

<Content>Kind of scary when arriving past dark My daughter and I booked on this island thinking it would be closer to the airport for my departure early in the morning. It isn't really closer than Kowloon, since you have to go over the mountain by taxi or bus. We arrived after dark by taxi, and since there is no beach front road, we had to walk down a one block alley with our luggage. It was dark and there were street people sleeping in the alley, a bit scarry for 2 American females. Once we got to the hotel, it was okay. Not the best, but I was tired of spending money, and it was cheap. Somewhat like a Motel 6 in the USA. Once you figure in the taxi fare, (yes, I know we could have taken the ferry, but we had a lot of luggage and thought a taxi was the way to go) both to the hotel and back again in the morning, we could have stayed at the Regal at the airport. We only stayed the one night, it was okay, but last minute booking at the Regal Airport Hotel would have been just as cheap, without the hassel of the taxi. I will say that it would be a nice place to stay with a family, a good base to see Hong Kong from. Cheap, not awful, and the people were very friendly. I would like to have seen the place in the day time. We arrived at dark and left in the dark. Update the place and it would be a real value!

<Content>Would only recommend if cost is biggest factor Advantages: short walk to 30-minute ferry that takes you to Central and Kowloon; very scenic; clean beds; helpful staffDisadvantages: although on same island as the airport, far, twisting 45 minute car ride to the hotel from the airport; 2-star tired looking rooms and facilities; no heat while I was there which made the room like an icebox. I would not recommend this place unless you're a cost-conscious backpacker or planning on a very short stay, and looking only for a place to sleep and if you are not planning on spending much time at the hotel.

<Content>Great value Recently spent four nights at the Silvermine. Agree with other reviewers that it is 'tired' but nevertheless can't beat it for location and peace and quiet. Staff all very friendly. Complimentary buffet breakfast more than adequate - lots of choices. You would never starve unless you were ultra fussy! We also enjoyed a dinner buffet on our last night. Again, lots of choices. The swimming pool and sauna were great. Room wise, very clean. Bed and pillows extremely firm! Took awhile to get used to this.Made use of Internet on one occasion - one hour free on the purchase of a drink.Would definitely stay at Silvermine again and probably use it as my base for duration of holiday. The ferries run often and it's a great ride across to Central. I would recommend to all.

<Content>Great Value and Convenience We were in Hong Kong for the opening of HK Disneyland and chose this hotel for the price (can't beat $52USD including taxes), we spent 5 nights there. Nice hotel in front of the beach (although I don't recommend bathing in HK waters), swimming pool and sauna, a gym is also available but had no time to use it.The ferry is 5 minutes walk from the hotel and ferries are available every 1/2 to an hour to take you to Hong Kong island. The price of the ferry is very reasonable, about 3 USD and takes 40 minutes; there's also a fast ferry that takes 1/2 the time for just a little more money, very negligeable amount.The last ferry to Lantau Island and Mui Wo (where the hotel is located) leaves around 11:30 pm from Hong Kong so you might want to take that in consideration.Both the airport and Disneyland are located on the same island: Lantau. The bus trip from the airport to the Silvermine hotel in Mui Wo was 45 minutes. Buses are always extremely ontime. To go to Disneyland take the train directly from the airport.Also, The Big Buddha, the Poh Lin monastery and the fishing Village of Tai Ho are on the same island and short bus rides away.Overall we felt this hotel was very convenient and affordable for any pocket. Probably one of the quietest hotels I've spend time at. The staff was very friendly and helpful (everyone we met in Hong Kong was) and I would be happy to come back to the same hotel.For those of you who can't live without internet, you can rent a broadband modem from the hotel desk for (I think I paid...) $15USD for 3 days.Luca Diana

<Content>Great place to go... The hotel is a really short walk from the Ferries that take 30 mins to Central and Tsim Sha Tsui and so is really just as convenient as being in a hotel in Kowloon that is still 40 mins from Central and in the middle of all the madness of town.Mui Wo is a really quiet place - it's spotless and a real retreat from the sweaty hustle and bustle of the city. OK it's not got a throbbing nightlife, but if you're there to relax, with a few days to get across to Downtown to sightsee and to do the rest, it's perfect - if you're in a rush to do all of HK in a couple of days, it may be a little far out, but with a week to sightsee it;s perfect.The hotel is good, OK, you look at it first and think it's like a Chinese take on the set of the golden girls, all flashing lights and cane furniture - it may be past it's best and the bathroom suites may be swamp green, but it's all clean and everything works, right down to the Buck Rogers control unit next the bed - first place I've ever been where you can control the radio, tv, bathroom lights, maid service, radio and clock... with the style and cutting edge that only second rate seventies design can offer.The difference with this place is that it all works, it's all clean, it's all comfortable and it's cheap. The food's good, the facilities are fantastic, there's a sauna, a swimming pool, a steam room, a gym, a bar with live entertainment and great breakfasts, it's 2 metres from a great beach and it's only 30 minutes from downtown. I'd definitely go back to the place. Don't stress either about the deposit of HK$300 they ask for on arrival (it's best to pay this cash). Basically should you have any meals in the hotel, or if you use the phone, this is taken off the HK$300 total... so really you're just leaving them money to cover their backs for any expenditure - if you don't use any of the HK$300 in the hotel, you get it all back when you leave.As a place Lantau is cheap, the taxi to the hotel from the Airport only cost HK$130 and the ferries are even cheaper than the MTR in downtown.The best thing about the Silvermine is that you get to see Hong Kong as not too many tourists see it - and as a result you get the best experience possible.

<Content>No Hong Kong craziness! Loved it! Okay- the Silvermine Beach Hotel is not the fanciest- it's not even classy but it doesn't pretend to be. It is a small, local hotel about 30 minutes ferry ride from Hong Kong and about 60 minutes from the airport. We stayed here as part of our last few days of vacation. We got into Hong Kong around 7 p.m. so we took a taxi to the hotel. It cost about $140 HK. I would recommend taking the taxi if you are coming in the evening. The A35 bus to LanTau doesn't run often and the roads to the hotel are windy and narrow so a taxi is best at night. The hotel is on a quiet side of the island- the other side is where the Big Buddha is which is the draw for most tourists to LanTau. It was so easy to take the ferry to HK for the day and come back to a small, quiet place to stay. The rooms are pretty dinky and small- not luxery but it is fine for sleeping. The showers are old school and the beds are small. The rooms have a small fridge, hair blow dryer and TV which was all we needed. We were able to get a room for $40铆sh USD a night which is major cheap compared to other HK hotels. I believe the rooms are usally $100 per night but we went through Expedia for the low rates. You get one hour free internet for each drink you purchase in the hotel bar. The bar also has these two awesome 5'0铆sh year old guys playing rock music on electric guitars in the evenings. Very homey feel- the people are great- seems family-owned. If you're not too picky about lodging- this is the perfect place to crash. The hotel is only steps from the beach and there are a few restaurants close by including a McDonalds, a few seafood places, a pizza place, etc. There's also a 7-eleven. Or just take the ferry to HK for dinner and shopping.
