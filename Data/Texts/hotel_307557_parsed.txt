<Content>A true gem This is a wonderful hotel. It may not be located in the tourist centre of Lovina, but it's well worth staying here. Rooms are spacious, bungalow-type with outdoor showers. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is beautifully landscaped, with a fantastic free-form pool and - it doesn't get more romantic than this - four poster beds on the beach overlooking the ocean. At 95 USD per night, this is a real treat.

<Content>Pleasant villas, great spa I stayed in one of the villas closest to the spa. The room was very nice, and I loved the outdoor shower. It is true that the tv received only one channel, in French, and there is a mosque nearby, so I heard the brief call to prayer during the night. The spa is especially lovely, and my pedicure was quite competent and pleasant. Service was polite and friendly. The pool is very pretty and if the pool area is full, the beach gazebos are also very nice. I did the dolphin cruise-it was great to see the dolphins, although there were a dozen or so other small boats in the area at the time. The food was good. All in all, I enjoyed this hotel.

<Content>Very bad experience 1) The reception pretended not to have received the reservation from the travel website we used and obliged us to pay a higher rate (and I lost my deposit...). Management was not nice at all (which is really rare in Bali)2) Room : the deluxe room with ocean view is a joke and our was not really clean. TV -- not a single channel working (same for my neighbour ;-)3) Noise: the hotel is located next to an islamic temple -- they use megaphones at 4 AM every morning for the prayers (impossible not to hear)4) Food: worst quality I''ve seen in Bali. Buffet only : no service at all, even for diner. Highly overpriced eg : cheapest glass of wine = 75000 rp (about 7$, same price in...new york) To conclude this hotel lacks charm, tranquility, service and professional and friendly management

<Content>Our Amazing Wedding This was the most amazing experience of our lives. We had a beautiful wedding where the staff could not have been friendlier.This was the trip of a lifetimw. I know we got married but I just couldnt beleive how super friendly the people were. We travelled all through Bali during our stay at several other hotels and this was the best.It isnt any good for kids as they will get bored but for couples it is outstanding. It is peaceful, helpful, staffs English was perfect, they cooked special meals for us, made us special teas. You name it.We saw Dolphins and ate the best food we have ever tasted. I would not only recommend staying here but I would say it was the best holiday ever and once our son is grown we wil be heading right back!There is so much to see and the people are so excited to show you around and explain their culture and their traditions - the lady at the restaurant was so excited she would dress me in their traditional clothes and we would have so much fun. Plenty to see and do, quite cheap, so much to buy! We saw the craftsmen making carvings, jewellery and everything.Breakfasts were huge and very tasty and I got an amazing tan in our 3 week stay on the island! (Most of it from Lovina sunbathing).The bintang beer is very nice too! Large bottles - tastes a bit like bud but better. Food was out of this world, chicken, duck everything.They left us letters every day on our bed about our wedding and suggesting places for us to go. They were always leaving flowers everywhere for me and cooking for us. When we got a DVD of the wedding they even brought a dvd player for us to watch it in our room.The most amazing experience ever!

<Content>Discover a diamond What a beautiful place! A quiet piece of the north away from the hustle and bustle of ubud and kuta, which are only a couple of hours away if you feel the need to visit. However, I found myself hankering for the peace and quiet of the Puri Bagus after a while. I loved it so much, I'm going back for Easter. The North coast is the warmest part so you'll enjoy the best weather. The staff are really friendly and go out of your way to help you....well they did for me. I recommend booking an appointment in the open air spa and spending a lazy afternoon in one of the pavillions. Absolute heaven!!

<Content>Loved It, I could have stayed longer if time allowed We adored it. It is spotless and friendly, and we especially liked the outside shower, although had the option of an inside one for if it was raining or evening when mozzies are biting. The rooms are extremely comfortable, and the whole location is so relaxing if you are on a whirlwind trip around Eastern Bali.The spa is lovely also, and worth spending a few hours there.We only ate in the restaurant for breakfast as I had read a review that for other meals the restaurant is expensive. We ate each evening at a restaurant up the road from the hotel, on the right - owned by a ver lovely Balinese guy and his German wife. A very hospitable place, that also offered cooking courses, which my friend did, and really rated.

<Content>Nice but lacking personality Me, my wife and some relatives spent 9 days in the Puri Bagus Lovina this july. Disregarding some apparent communication problems between our agent and the hotel check in was efficient and fast.Me and my wife got a Deluxe Ocean View and the relatives Superior Garden view. Both bungalow types were nice and clean, although the extra money we spent on the ocean view definitely wasn't worth it. Sure, we saw the ocean, but we definitely had to work on it to manage (trees and other buildings in the way). The cable tv consisted of CNN and two indonesian channels, so not much to write home about (not that tv was the reason for going to Bali).The hotel grounds were beautiful. A lot of flowers and trees. Make sure you watch the palm trees though as we almost got hit by falling coconuts twice. They do not seem to keep after the trees enough.The pool was nice, if maybe a bit small. The last fact made worse by the hotel arranging diving courses that partly took place in the pool. The beach is not really bath friendly, but some stretches of it are quite nice during high tide and the black sand is really splendid! The gazebos along the beach are wonderful and I can highly recommend them, sadly there're not that many of them and when a lot of people are in the hotel you will have to get up really early to manage to get a hold of either a sun chair or a gazebo. There're just not enough of them and the recommendation we got from the assistant hotel manager was just that: get up early and put a towel on a chair to book it before heading to breakfast. The only problem with this was that towels were cleared away from a chair if nothing else was there too (as they should be). Most people put down books or something like that in addition to the towels, but sadly my sister and her boyfriends books got stolen from one of the gazebos. After talking to management (who first told them that the books hadn't been stolen but that they had misplaced them in their bungalow) the books eventually resurfaced after a visit to the small village that's located next to the hotel. The irritating part was, of course, the attitude from management since the books disappeared during a 10 minute absence.The restaurant served a very nice breakfast buff茅 and had nice food over all. Rather expensive though and especially drinks were about three times the price to what they should be. We only had a few meals in the hotel and left the hotel grounds for all others. We can especially recommend 1000 Dreams that's just outside the Puribagus if you walk left along the beach. They had cheap and very tasty food and great service that put a golden lining on our stay.One last thing that was a tad irritating was the rather insistent tries to get you to sign up for the different buff茅s etc that the hotel arranged. You just don't have to both place flyers in the bungalow and ask 2-3 times. After a while that gets really irritating.To sum up, we had a nice and relaxing stay with a few points of irritation. Mostly we had expected a bit more from the Puri Bagus Lovina, but on the whole it's a nice hotel if maybe a bit expensive for what you actually get.

<Content>Nice Stay in the North of Bali Great stay at the Puri Bagus. Nice Infinity pool. Extremely attentive staff reasonably priced good food with nice selection. Only real downside is you are a bit out of Lovina itself and the next door Mosque's call to prayers at 5:00AM can get annoying but then again it adds to the overall flavour. In all a nice play to stay with expansive grounds, gardens and pool. Black Volcanic Beach is farily small but snorkeling can be done right from hotel or arrange reef trip with local boats for around $10-15.

<Content>Relaxing hotel with wonderful staff I stayed at this lovely hotel on my own a couple of weeks ago.I canot speak highly enough about it. The actual setting and lay-out of the hotel is beautiful with cotages in spacious gardens leading to the sea. There is a stunning (quite small) infinity pool.My room was large with a great outdoor bathroom. There's a super outdoor spa where I enjoyed a great massage.I ate in the restaurant and found the food to be superb and at the same costs at local restaurants.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful in the extreme -nothing was too much trouble. On the day I left I found I had left my wedding ring in my room and called the hotel manager in a panic. I need not have worried as a member of staff personally delivered my ring to me to my immense gratitude.A lovely hotel - a fantastic experience.

<Content>Never wanted to leave Puri Bagus Firstly a thank you to Trip Advisor, without valued comments from your members my wife and I would not have ventured this far from Nusa Dua which we have visited on a number of occasions over the past few years. However this trip we wanted to explore the area of Lovina and from the positive feed back from those people who had stayed at the Puri Bagus a BIG thank you.What can I say, the area is beautiful, the people are fantastic and unlike commercial Kuta and coast filled hotels Lovina is just wonderful.Keep in mind that it will take you 2-3 hours to travel there from Dempasar but I promise you well worth the trip and besides lots to take in, feels twice the distance coming back the other way bacause you don't want to leave.The resort I believe has 40 stand alone units , quite large inside and each with out door shower, ours backed on to a rice paddy, short stroll to the main dining  bar areas which overlook the pool. Well maintained grounds and pool, again just a few steps to the beach, Bali Sea. Don't be put off by the black sand, it's only a few feet wide and the sea water is very warm.The local fishing fleet with their array of colored boats is well worth the 5 minutes walk to view and like us catch a few words with the local fisherman. Girls you'll love the spa and not expensive as with local eateries etc. Check out the Belgium owned restaurant in Lovina, meals are well priced and a good wine selection. If in doupt ask the local people, fantastic couple who own the local store on the main road to the resort, can also help in transport. Ask for Darma at the Puri, great guy as with the staff, if you do decide to visit I reckon 5 days will suffice and just long enough to see and do every thing for a complete wind down, enjoy..

<Content>romantic, exellent spa and small hotel .. don麓t miss this in Bali... My husband and I have a 10 year anniversary and decided that this small beach hotel where you have the sea 15 m from your own house is a good place to be..The house had a big room with windows to the sea and a high ceailing. Every house in surrounded by flowers and a walking path.The bathroom, three steps down, had a shower and extra outdoor shower within walls-fantastic!The Spa in the end of the hotel-area was fantastic with running water and a fountain. The staff was very good and we had massage 3 times and was very pleased every time, we really recommend it!The food and drinks was exellent and the staff was very helpful.The pool-area is very nice but not so good if you have small children that can麓t swim.We liked this hotel because it is small, you can have all your meals here and the staff is very serviceminded. All the food is coming from the gardens and farmers nearby.It麓s very calm and nice at the evenings and the sundown are fantastic..We had a guide for a half day in Singraja and saw the library with scrifts from 1819 and earlier written on bamboo, weaving factory, foodmarket, and visit a place were the make the instruments for the Bali-dance-performances. We also had a lovely lunch at a garden where all the veg are grown that the hotels uses in there meals.At the gourmet hotel Damai we had our anniversary-dinner, suited 4 km from Lovina beach in the slope of the mountain, sorrounded of trees and coffeplantations with an incredible view of the coast.They served the best gourmet dinner in Bali with excellent wine, a dinner to remember..Thank you Puri Bagus Lovina for a wonderful memory...The swedish family in 104..

<Content>Romantic beachfront setting We stayed here for three nights. It is a lovely place to stay with gigantic rooms and a lovely outside shower. The Bali huts right on the beach were a great place to spend the day without getting too much sun. The restaurant was good, the food well priced.The only downside was the distance from Lovina shops about 7 kilometres there was a shuttle bus that ran every morning at 9am but it picked you up again at 11am. Not that there was much to do in Lovina anyway. All in all a nice place to stay.

<Content>Top marks for this resort ! We booked this hotel for a 2 night stay beginning of August 2006. I hesitated between Damai and Puri Bagus, but thought it would be nicer to stay right at the sea, so PB it was. After reading positive reviews here, I expected a nice experience but let me guarantee you : this fantastic little resort exceeded my expectations ! Setting and layout of this property is just perfect : right at the sea in well kept gardens and very idyllic. The hotel is about 600 meters from the main road which runs parallel to the sea. True, there is a mosque at the main road and light sleepers might wake up around sunrise because of it. In our group of 4, nobody found that really disturbing since praying time is only 5 to 10 minutes and can only be heard remotely. Don't let this be a factor to choose another place. Really, only unhappy guests make a point out of this in my opinion. Bungalows are really great. True, the level of luxury and furnishing is not of a 5 star level, but rooms were large, functional and even cozy in our opinion. And very important : equipped with a low noise, well functioning airco system. The nights before we stayed in 5 star properties like Sheraton Nusa Dua and Meridien Tanah Lot, but Puri Bagus rooms did not displease us at all. The outdoor showers are really nice too : if you are not too prude (why should you feel uncomfortable when really nobody can see you using it), you will certainly enjoy them ! The terrace with two chairs and a table was also great : we had our Gin and tonic there every evening, looking at the sunset. When you intend to book a room, you will notice you will have to choose between a 'deluxe ocean view' and a ' superior garden view' villa. We booked the latter and are happy we did : interior of all villas is exactly the same and of the 40 villas, I think around 35 have an ocean view. The chance of having a villa without an ocean view is rather low and is not really a drama neither : pool and beachside area is so nice that you don't really need an ocean view from your room. Since other guests complained about the dinner experience, we didn't even try their restaurant in the evening. First evening we went to Kubu Lalang, a seaside restaurant around 2 kms towards Kalibukbuk. This restaurant, managed / owned by an Austrian woman, is AMAZING ! Fantastic food at great prices (seafood platter for two with a bottle of wine : around 25 euro) in a wonderful location. A must in Lovina ! Second night, we had dinner in the nearby Warung (around 100m from hotel) and had a great 'rijsttafel'. Easy, because you can just walk to the restaurant, good food, crowded and guests are almost all from Puri Bagus I think (while restaurant at PB was almost empty). There were some touts on the beach, but a firm 'No thanks' made them leave quickly. In fact I did book a dophin watching tour with one of them (much less expensive when you book directly with them and not via hotel). We saw many dolphins. In fact, just having the boat trip and enjoying sunrise was worth it already. 0ne of our nicest memories ! Our driver said that in June - July - August - September the chance of seeing dolphins is close 100 %. I don't know about other months, but I suggest you to ask the hotel if you are interested. We used the spa as well : a 3 hour session for 2 persons costed us around 90 euro. You can find a lot cheaper but also a lot more expensive in Bali. Having tried around 5 spa treatments while touring in Bali, I conclude that the price is fair for what you get. Also the setting near the beach is great. Definitely to be recommended. So, defintely to be recommended !

<Content>Nice relaxing place We stayed for 2 nights at the Puri Bagus after our stays in Nusa Dua and Ubud. After the luxury of the Alila we were a bit disappointed when we arrived. The bungalow was fine and big but needed a bit of refurbishment. I must say we did not try the outside shower maybe because we did not stay long enough or were not brave enough!Also were the rice fields replaced by robacco? The calls from the nearby mosque woke us up and so did the engines of, I believe, farm vehicles (tobacco fields).The TV did not offer much entertainment but that did not really matter.On the first night the hotel offered a balinese buffet and dance on a very nice stage. Food was nice but not wonderful. Maybe we should have tried one of the two restaurants on the access road specially for seafood.The grounds are very pretty and well maintained. The bale are very relaxing and romantic as long as you are not pestered by the touts offering those famous dolphin trips or anything else. Most people said that they did not see any dolphins and went back to bed.The pool is great for a swim as the beach is not really inviting, small and not very clean.It was very pleasant to sit with a drink and watch the sunset. Puri Bagus is a very nice place for a few nights with immaculate gardens and large bungalows. The staff is dilligent and nice.
