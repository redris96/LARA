<Content>Excellent choice in Firenze! Balcony Hotel is an excellent choice for who wants to explore Firenze by foot. Close to the train station the hotel has a familiar environment and its owner Francesco is very friendly. He has treated us as we were someone from his family. The breakfast was very nice with fresh breads and the machine's capuccino was perfect.All of our requests were perfectly covered in the hotel and we definitely recommend it. I hope to come back again to Firenze and also to the BalconyGrazie mille Francesco!!

<Content>Excellent value for excellent accommodations I was surprised and very please by this little hotel so close to the center of Florence. The pricing for the value was terrific. It was clean and well kept. The bathroom was good sized and well maintained. Our room was on the second floor and felt very safe and secure. The room was quiet and plenty warm enough at night. Breakfast was fine, nothing elaborate but the coffee and hot chocolate were super. Lots of cereal, breads, and canned fruits to choose from. Certainly more than enough to get me started each day.My husband and I walked around the city quite a lot in the evenings and never felt unsafe approaching the hotel. While I was traveling with my husband, I would recommend this hotel for single women. It was within easy walking distance to the train station, the Duomo, Uffizzi and other main areas. Francesco - the hotel keeper- clearly loves what he does and is a great host. His English is terrific and he was very helpful with any questions we had.Overall, I would total recommend this hotel to anyone, even if you are not on a tight budget - it was great:-)

<Content>Great location and value Spent 4 nights here in early October at 95 Euros per night for a double (twin). Got very quiet standard European-sized room in back. Room and common areas immaculate. Big pluses were hot water and water pressure, choices at breakfast, friendliness and helpfulness of staff, location (between Santa Maria Novella and Duomo; 300 meters from bus and train stations). BBC and CNN on TV. Internet was steep, but several cafes nearby. 20m to gelateria! Heartily recommended. I would rate at 4.5 overall if I had the chance, but won't even consider looking for an alternative when I return.

<Content>Just Perfect Been meaning to write this review for some time. Selected the Balcony after much research on Trip Advisor (booked directly) and my wife  I spent 5 nights here in mid September 08. Even before our arrival, Francesco had been more than helpful in booking times for us at the Uffizi  Accadamia and from the time we checked in we felt right at home. It's ideally located between the Santa Maria Novella station and the Duomo and an easy walk to all the other main attractions. We really enjoyed our complimentary coffeee (or Hot Chocolate) and a chat with Francsco after a long day of touring. Only a couple of minor irritations with a bit of noise off the street and inconsiderate guests on the balcony not keeping their voices down late at night. However, the room was clean and comfortable, breakfast was fine and all in all, just perfect for our stay in this wonderful city.

<Content>A Big Thumbs Up I've been meaning to write this review for a few months now. I attended a conference in Florence last April and needed a reasonably priced hotel in the centre of the city. I found Hotel Balcony on Tripadvisor; the reviews looked good so I decided to stay there. I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is in a great location, near the Duomo. My room was reasonably sized, very clean and in good condition. However, what made the hotel stand out was Franceso, the proprietor -- he's personable, friendly and very helpful; his restaurant recommendations were excellent. Also, the rooftop terrace was quite pleasant with a bit of the Duomo's dome visible from the edge. In April I had the terrace to myself -- a real treat.

<Content>excellent little budget hotel I'm a regular visitor to Firenze and have stayed in some pretty mediocre and overpriced hotels. So I've been looking for a place like this for a long time. A truly great little place to stay -- excellent location, clean and comfortable, and cheap as chips. The balcony is a terrific place to unwind and rest your feet and eat yummy food from the Mercato Centrale. And Francesco is quite possibly the loveliest hotel manager ever! The only problem is that the TripAdvisor reviews are so good that I might not be able to get a room in future...

<Content>Just ok This is a tough review to post--generally, Francesco is an amazing person and tries his best to run a great hotel. He was great about helping in any way that he could, so I hate to give a bad review.However, we had several problems during our stay. Some of the things were simply flukes (toilets not working, etc.), so I will not dwell on those issues, as they were things that Francesco could not do anything about. Plus, he gave us a discount for our stay because of the problems.What he can improve are a few little things. For example, this is a non-smoking hotel, but the lobby smelled of smoke. The bed was extremely hard, and the sheets and towels were fairly low quality. We're not looking for anything particularly nice--we did not spend much time in the hotel, so we were not looking for an American-style accommodation. But it just was not the most comfortable stay. The location is great, and Francesco is really friendly and helpful. But overall this was the least comfortable place we stayed in Italy.

<Content>Just what we were looking for If you are looking for a moderately priced, clean, conveniently located hotel in the center of Florence, look no further. The Hotel Balcony fulfills all those requirements and many more. After a long day of sight-seeing the shower felt great and the bed was clean and comfortable. We asked for and received a room off the street, so our stay was cool and quiet . Francesco, the owner, is a gem. I emailed him about a month before our trip, and he was kind enough to make a reservation for us at the Academia so we could go right to the ticket booth and into the museum in about 2 minutes. (There was no charge for this service!) His English is great ( a relief after stumbling along in our poor Italian for days) and he is genuinely friendly. When we return to Florence (someday soon I hope) we will definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great Find! Four of us traveled Italy for 2 weeks. We stayed at Hotel Balcony on a whim and we now feel so lucky to have found it! The hotel is clean, safe and centrally located. The rooms are simple, but cute and clean. The common balcony is a fun place to drink a bottle of wine and socialize. The owner, Francesco, will loan you glasses and even open the bottle for you! He speaks perfect English and helped us out with finding good restaurants and even helped us book our hotel in the next city that we traveled to. This is, by far, the best overall value, for a budget hotel, that I have ever stayed at. Thanks Francesco!

We really found all that and more in the Hotel Balcony.The owner, Franceso, was so wonderful, from the moment you enter to photos with him when you leave, you feel like you made a friend. Breakfasts were perfect. Rooms; small, but who spends time in the room with all of Florence outside your door!We highly recommend this little gem of a hotel.S.S. Florida

<Content>Great place to stay I recently stayed at Hotel Balcony with my parents and sister. We had two rooms in the small hotel. We requested rooms towards the back off the main street and we got them. The owner was great, spoke wonderful English, gave us recommendations on places to eat, he was just very helpful in general. My parents stayed in a double room with a small shower but it was very sufficient. I stayed in a twin room with my sister and our room was very suitable for our needs. The rooms are very basic but we weren't in Italy to sit in a hotel, so it was great. The balcony really has a nice view of the Duomo and the hotel could not be in a better location. I would recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Great little hotel! We booked the Hotel Balcony after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor and they are all spot on! The location is great. Just a couple blocks from the train station, but definitely in the heart of the city. We were three young college students traveling abroad with no knowledge of the city and the owner definitely helped us navigate our way around. He even booked us tickets to see The David with only a day's notice! It was also very important to us that we didn't feel unsafe walking near the hotel at night. The room was comfortable, nothing too fancy. What we expected for a hotel in the middle of the city. There is internet access for a price (I don't remember how much). Overall, a great stay!

<Content>Back in a Hearbeat The Balcony offorded the most pleasant stay of my family's recent trip to Italy. It was the perfect match for our modest budget. The interior is reasonably spacious, relatively new and spotlessly clean. The Balcony's location is ideal. We arrived from and departed to Santa Maria Novella Station on foot, with all our luggage, and walked conveniently to every destination in the city.Not least important in the three days we spent there was the personal attention of our host, Francesco. He seemed always available, always in good spirits and always helpful. He was especially attentive to children, and made our 9-year-old feel perfectly at home.With another opportunity to visit Florence, we would return to the Balcony without a moment's hesitation.

<Content>Excellent Experience with Hotel Balcony My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Balcony recently. This was my first visit to Italy and we stayed 7 days. I used Trip Advisor to find an economical hotel but was worried about what we would find. Francesco and Hotel Balcony went way beyond my expectation. The service was superb! Francesco, who speaks impeccable English, booked reservations to the museums for us, gave us directions, reserved taxicabs, and in the evening, when we would have a glass of wine before dinner, he would chat with us. He is a native Florentine so we heard many stories and insights. Our double room was spacious and clean. The room contained a mini bar that was restocked daily. The bathroom was clean, user friendly and had soaps, shampoos and other amenities. The towels were replaced daily if we left them on the floor. The hotel has satellite TV, an Internet pod in the hallway that cost 5 euro per hour, a small library, and an outstanding breakfast! We had breads, meat, cheeses, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, granola, 3 kinds of coffee, tea and juices. It was chilly when we visited Florence, but the very large balcony was awesome and in the warmer months would be an excellent asset to enjoyment of the hotel.The location of Hotel Balcony can't be beat. It is central to everything. Another asset is the restaurant next door and the ATM right outside the front entry. There is a wine shop and a bistro that serves ramen noodles as well as Italian foods at the end of the block. We had a wonderful adventure in Florence and will always revisit Hotel Balcony in the future. Viva Italia! Viva Francesco!

<Content>'A' for Location The first impression of this hotel: very modest. The second impression: wow, what a terrific location!. If you want good value and a marvellous central location, you will find this hotel fits the bill. It is within short walking distance of high-end fashion shops, the Duomo, the squares and the Station.Our room was plain with no balcony, the bathroom clean and functional. The lobby is very basic, the breakfast is served in an area behind the front desk. The breakfast was much better than some of the other hotels where we stayed in Italy. The espresso machine works very well, there was fruit and appetizing cereal.The proprietor is extremely helpful, he aided us with a dinner recommendation and stored our bags after checkout.

<Content>Recommend the Balcony We stayed for two nights in June at Hotel Balcony in Florence. It is an excellent deal and very close to the City Center and all the main attractions. We had a nice room on the Balcony with a leaning view of the Duomo. We were worried that perhaps the room might be noisy since there are seats on the balcony but everyone was very respectful and the hotel policy of quiet after 10pm is strictly enforced. Having the adjacent balcony made our room feel bigger. Bathrooms are european sized and the breakfast is basic. Dollar for Euro this was the best hotel value we had in Italy. The owner was extremely helpful in helping us navigate both Florence and the sometimes perplexing Italy. It was our first trip there so we had lots of questions. He has lived in the USA so his english is great and he's a lot of fun to hang out with. Ask him about his car. Anyway, we highly recommend Hotel Balcony as a clean, discount, friendly hotel close to everything in Florence.looks ok publish

<Content>Practical and bargain-priced My wife and I stayed in the Balcony for 4 nights in May 2006. We decided on this hotel after researching all the budget hotels near the train station (using travel books and websites). When we arrived we knew we made the right choice. Here is our experience and impression:Pros: Location is halfway between Train/Bus Stations and the Duomo, and within easy reach of attractions near the Arno River. It is on a quite side street with little traffic. Our room is near the far end of the balcony and quiet all day. The room is not too small nor too big. There was enough space inside the cash-bar refrigerator to store bottled water, wine, and cheese. Bed and linens were clean and comfy. The bathroom was small and might not be suitable for big people. We weigh less than 120 lbs, so no problem. The self-serve breakfast food and drinks were simple and tasty. I would say they are similar to those of Quality Inn or Days Inn in USA. Fresh fruits of the day were a plus. The staff is extremely helpful, without language problem. We asked and were directed to a mini-mart (Conrad) in an adjacent street for necessity shopping.Cons: The balcony which their website described as a unique feature was not maintained well. The tables and chairs were scattered around and dusty, so we did not utilize this facility at all. Otherwise it would have been a nice treat. The AC control inside the room can be overridden by the management. One day it was on, the other day it was shut down (not hot enough?) Luckily in May it was not really that hot (80's F).

<Content>Great Econo Hotel close to sights but beware having room near balcony We stayed at the Hotel Balcony for 5 nights, from May 15 checking out on the 20th. It is in a great location in Florence that is a 10 min walk to train and 5 min walk to Duomo and 10-15 to everything else! They provided a good breakfast of cereal, fresh fruit and buns and an automatic expresso/ hot chocolate machine that actually made really good cappucinos! I saw people with young children and they were very helpful and engaged. The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was clean except for shower doors that wouldn't clse properly so we had to use towels to clean up water seepage. The staff were excellent and so friendly and helpful that they made up for some problems. The a/c did not work and they did not have another room for us so they apologized and asked if we didn't mind propping our window open at night. It wasn't too warm yet so that was fine except that our room looked out directly onto the huge Balcony and they allowed it to be open all night. Guests were there drinking wine and enjoying the evening air at midnight and by 12:30am we called down to the front desk and said we can't sleep because of the noise. He came up to double check the A/C and could hear the people and said that it was still TOO EARLY to ask them to leave and I said we just want to sleep and it is not our fault that the A/C does not work. We told him that we had an early booking for the Uffizi at 8:30am and probably alot of the other guests were in Florence to sight see as well. He agreed and said he'd talk to the guests on the Balcony and explain and ask them to try to keep it quiet. It only worked for 30min and they were loud until 2am. The reception guy was nice and asked us how it went in the morning but I said in the end we had to sleep with our window shut so we were uncomfortable but he meant well and it is really the Hotel that sets the policy. I am going to write them a letter and let them know my concerns since they try so hard and seem so friendly trying to make your stay enjoyable. The other thing that is a problem here is that even though there are no smoking signs posted everywhere in the hotel, smoke wafts up and it is pretty strong. You don't smell it in your room but if you are sensitive to it then take this into account. In the end if you want a cheap hotel stay in Florence, this is a good place to stay because they do try their best and it is clean.

The balcony was very nice, but unfortunately, it was too cold for me to enjoy it. Would recommend this hotel for the price. The only issue was the cigarette smoke that drifted from the downstairs up into the room, but a minor annoyance.

<Content>Left The Night We Arrived My boyfriend and I arrived to Florence and checked into Hotel Balcony, which was a terrible experience. First at check in, he told me it would be 5 euro more than when I booked it and I could speak with someone in the morning about it. Furthermore, the lighting was terrible, room was dull, bathroom was almost pitch dark, and the shower was missing a glass door. (I am aware not all showers have doors, but this one was honestly missing). The man at the front desk was not very helpful, but tried by offering us extra towels for the shower. We asked for a difference room, but there were not any available. He told us that we could speak with someone in the morning about the shower problem. We were only in Florence for two nights and wanted to have a nice stay so we left. Also, upon arrival a lady was at the front desk because her key had broke while opening the door so she was holding a piece of a key.We bumped into Hotel Accademia which was not too far away but definitely on a street that was well kept up in comparision. The rate for the room was similar to Hotel Balcony and really worth it.

<Content>Excellent Value - would stay again I booked this hotel for 3 nights in Florence with my Mother and was a bit anxious about how it would be despite the reviews I had read. We were very pleased. The location was perfect with lots of places to eat near by. The room was great and the shower room better than we expected. The staff were very helpful. Our room initially had a double bed but was changed to twin beds with no problem at all. We were given lots of suggestions and help with train timetables. I would highly recommend the balcony for it's fantastic value for money...in a prime location with comfortable beds, clean room and bathroom and very helpful staff. Breakfast was fine and lots of it.

Also features a rooftop terrace with some tables and chairs, which we used during the evening to relax with a bottle of wine. Clean rooms and a decent breakfast, which had bread, cereal, fruit, cheese, tea/coffee and juice. Staff speaks fluent English, French and Italian (and probably more languages...). Would return!
