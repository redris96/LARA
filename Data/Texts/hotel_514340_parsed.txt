<Content>Very impressed with hotel room,location and staff! We only stayed here overnight( to our regret) but were so impressed with the  GREEN ROOM , as we called it, that we did not want to leave!!! The canal view outside was FANTASTIC! The sight of this plus the hustle and bustle of the people in the morning just takes you back in time! The location was perfect if you want a quiet and restful night. MR. Paolo and staff were friendly and accomodating.WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK HERE IF WE VISIT VENICE AGAIN!!!!

<Content>Fantastic This hotel was easy to get to by the ferry service or the train station. It is located just out of the major tourist trail, and we liked that !! Loved our stay there, would stay again in a heartbeat. Staff were all very helpful, our room had a canal view, and did I mention breakfast out on the canal each morning ? :)

<Content>Charming Inexpensive Hotel The hotel was charming and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was very good value compared to hotels in pricey Venice. The hotel is not in the nicest part and it is not in the central location of Venice, but is very convinent to get in and out of venice. It is within walking distance from the train station and there is 40 min water shuttle stop to the airport right nearby.

<Content>The Perfect Place to Stay in Venice Ca' Dogaressa is a wonderful hotel! We stayed in the junior suite which overlooks the canal. The room was large, lovely and spotlessly clean. The staff, especially Paolo and Daniele, were friendly, thoughtful and so helpful. We enjoyed the breakfast outside facing the canal. We especially liked the location. Ca' Dogaressa is on a small canal and away the the crowds, which was a welcome respite at the end of a long day. Yet, the hotel is only a 15-20 minute walk to St. Mark's Square. You can pick up the water taxi about a block away. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and wouldn't stay anywhere else. We can't wait to return.

<Content>Excellent veneto Hotel We loved Ca dogaressa. Rooms are big , clean with classic style and excellent amenitites. Renovated, we felt the 19th century ambiance living in this room for 3 nights. Bathroom is big, clean with excellent ventilation; only lacks shower curtain though. Service is excellent provided by Paulo which was a great support in all we need as well as in giving directionsWe would stay back in this small lovely hotel

We loved everything about our stay at Hotel Ca' Dogaressa but our favorite part was the wonderful continental breakfast served to us alongside the canal by the terrific and helpful owners/staff.Our room was very clean and quiet as well. Close to everything and a short walk to the train station. We've already recommended Hotel Ca' Dogaressa to our family for their trip next year.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Excellent Place in Venice We chose the Hotel Ca Dogaressa going by the really good reviews it had right here on TripAdvisor and I can say that the Hotel was excellent, Great People running it, very nice rooms cleaned every day, breakfast outside on the edge of the canal and it was only a 10 minute walk from the Railway Station so you don't even need to fork out for a Taxi Boat! It's in a really ideal place where it's really quiet yet it only take a short walk to get to the main parts of Venice or to the Public Transport /Taxi Boats. It's really good for a three star hotel and would definately stay there again if I can every afford to go back there.

<Content>Worth the Price This hotel is located in the Cannaregio section of Venice, not far from the train station. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was beautiful and clean. The bathroom was nice, but no shower curtain, so make sure you aim the shower head in the right direction! I don't remember seeing an elevator, so if you need one, this isn't the place. For breakfast, we enjoyed fresh fruit, croissants, espresso and yogurt at a table right next to Canale di Cannaregio, watching the water taxi's, water buses and other boats carrying goods and supplies into the area. I thought this was well worth the price!

<Content>The best hotel in Venice We've just got back from Venice and I can say with sincerity that this is a fantastic hotel to stay in. It's clean and comfortable, and I think the air conditioning saved my life. The hotel is easily accessed from the Guglie stop, you don't have to drag your suitcases over any bridges just take a small stroll up the canal side.The staff in the hotel are really friendly, helpful, kind and considerate and nothing seems too much trouble for them. Next time I go to Venice I AM stopping there again.Some reviews say there is not enough food provided at breakfast, but I don't know if they've increased the amount but we found we had far more than we can eat.

<Content>Really Liked this Hotel We recently stayed two nights in Venice at Ca' Dogaressa. A real gem in the Ghetto area. The Hotel staff was very accomodating to our travel needs and responsive to our questions. The breakfasts are nice right along the canal. Room was very clean and efficient in layout and resources. Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for the BB feel in a unique location outside of the tourist center. We will return next year when we visit Venice in the Summer!

<Content>Loved it!!! So close but quiet and romantic! Venice at its best! My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and it was so romantic and perfect! Paolo is so nice and offered us Prosecco when he found out we were on our honeymoon. The hotel is gorgeous and the rooms are beautiful with huge bathrooms. Everything is clean and there is a gorgeous rooftop terrace that overlooks the canal. In addition it is easy to find (very close the to the train station and Piazzele Roma) and is close to 2 vaporetto stops. It is so close the 'main strips' of Venice but is far enough away that it is quiet and peaceful.The breakfast is wonderful served on the canal...cereal, juice, coffee, rolls and jams..very good and filling. I cannot say enough about Paolo and everyone there (I think it is his family). They are all friendly and seem to really love their jobs and take pride in the hotel. When we were going out one night and it was raining he lent us an umbrella and then called ahead to a great restaurant to let them know we were coming.When we left they stored our luggage for us until our cruise left and they even have a bathroom with shower that you can use to freshen up in again if you need to.We are hoping to go back to Venice in a few years and will for sure be staying here again!

<Content>Beautiful for reasonable price This is a charming, beautifully decorated, quaint little hotel. The staff were friendly and very helpful, and all of their restaurant recommendations were fantastic! We were so surprised at the quality of the accomodation, given the price we paid was pretty reasonable. Of course, like all small family run affairs, it's an informal set up and not 5 star bell-hop service. I find this is part of the charm of small places like this though. Also, if you have any trouble tackling stairs with suitcases, you many have a problem here. Clean, great location - on a canal front, could walk pretty much anywhere you wanted (like most of Venice though). Absolutely recommend this place.

<Content>A perfect Venetian hotel An imptomptu visit to Venice brought me to Tripadvisor. I wanted 4 nights in Venice but could only get 1 night here.I decided the hotel could make or break the trip and so I booked the one night available and made other (luckily good) arrangements for the 3 remaining nights,We had the 1st floor room overlooking the canal and it was superb. Tastefully furnished (repro) and spotlessly clean. Great, friendly service. Good breakfast. The trattoria on the other side of the canal is good as well.Please bring a few words of Italian with you!

<Content>A convenient location in 'real' Venice Venice is expensive, teeming with tourists and touts of one kind or another. So the real benefits of this hotel are:-a peaceful, colourful, location on the Canal di Cannaregio (one of the old ways into the city) where you see real Venetian life around you - mothers taking children to school by boat, delivery barges plying the water, old ladies with cats leaning out of balconied windows. The local restaurants have local customers, and the small grocery shops are also for residents so don't have 'tourist tat'. an easy travel distance from the station and airport - not to be underestimated in a city of small canals/streets and many bridges, where a water-taxi is ludicrously expensive. It is a short walk from the Guglie water-bus stop, where one of the special airport water-boat also stops (12 Euros per person each way, but the easy and comfort are worth it). a friendly, family run hotel where you feel at home with the thoughtful/friendly little touches. It has beautiful traditional Venetian decoration, clean marble bathrooms, and modern conveniences - safe, air conditioning, TV (not flat screen), fridge. When warm, breakfast is taken on the canal side - a nice feature. the sites of Venice can all be walked too quite easily if you are able-bodied; but the best thing to do is to buy a water-bus travel pass and jump on and off at will - useful if you need to cross to other islands or want to explore the outer islands of Venice. Two other stops besides Guglie are very close by, and another two only a short walk away. The hotel is practically next to the historic and evocative Jewish Ghetto - one of the few havens for Jews in Europe since the 14th century - at a price. The things you may not like:-Only a low level shower attachment on the wall over the bath - so take some aromatic bath oils and have a wonderful long soak after a hot day site seeing instead. TV is small and some people may not like the fact it is not flat screen. But you can spend the whole evening sitting in one of the small restaurants only a stones throw away - watching the Venetians and tourists parade out in the evening cool as the sun goes down. (Obviously different when the weather is chilly.) Breakfast is 'continental' and may not be enough if you are used to big breakfasts. But if you do want another croissant or more coffee (very good) just ask. That is the advantage of the hotel being family fun. We were extremely happy with this hotel and would definitely return.

<Content>Little gem - would stay again This is a gem of a hotel - the room we had was beautiful and decorated in the traditional Venetian style, but with the mod cons you need on holiday (aircon, fridge, safe, TV etc). Staff all spoke English and were present 24 hours a day, offering advice on where to eat etc. We had to leave at 7am for our train but as it was before breakfast, they even made us a small bag of drink and food to take with us.Great location for the train and bus station, as well as 100m from the nearest boat stop. Only gripe we had was the shower (hand held in a bath with no curtain), but this was a very minor thing. Great value for money - will definitely stay again!

<Content>How a small 3-Star Hotel should be ! I booked La Ca'Dogeressa to spend just one night with my wife and our two children in April.The booking through Venere.com was no trouble.This small boutique hotel is very conveniently located near the railway station.Don't be fooled by the short distance it seems to be on the map, you will still have a good ten minute walk to reach the hotel, passing over a bridge.Still, this is one of the best hotel locations in Venice. If you stay anywhere else almost, you will have either take a kind of omnibus-ship or to hire a water taxi. The water taxis are a real rip-off, they take about 80 EUR for 15 mins of transportation (that's more than 130 USD for you yanks).As all the other reviewers already stated, the hotel is nice, very clean, Paolo and the other guy whose name I forgot are really nice and help with everything. Really.It was also perfect for my family, the extra bed had been placed in the room.Just don't ask them for advice when it comes to places to eat - we went to the restaurant on the other side of the canal, and it was just abysmal.But the hotel is great.

<Content>Everthing great Everything great about this hotel - only wish that they served snacks and drinks on the canal terrace at other times of the day as well as breakfast as the setting was so nice. My only (very tiny) moan would be the lack of shower curtain (stayed in room 1 - the junior suite, had a shower over the bath) but having created my own mini canal on the bathroom floor on day 1, found the best way to shower was by sitting down in the bath and when using soap,shampoo etc, try holding the shower head between your feet so that you don't have to keep switching the water off. Not ideal I know but everthing else is so good at the hotel, it wasn't too much of a hardship and the water was constantly, consistently hot which as we all know is a bit of a rarity when on holiday.

<Content>amazing!!!!! My friend  I stayed at this lovely hotel for 4 nights in early May which is situated on a smaller canal . The hotel is only small but the rooms are larger than the average european hotel room, the decor was very venitian  pleasing to the eye ,the room  bathroom were exceptionally clean with small toiletries provided.The hotel is situated in a quieter area of Venice but was still bustling with the local life. the restruants  shops were plentiful in the near by streets  the water bus stops were in easy reach. We chose this hotel because it is near the main train station 15mins walk with luggage as we had to leave for Paris early in the morning because of this Paulo organised a packed breakfast to take with us which was very thoughtful  appreciated by us, Paulo  Daniel are the ultimate hosts only too happy to help in any way whether it be extra coffee at breakfast or assiting in tourist directions.My memories will be very lasting of this hotel --a wonderful ,wonderful stay thank you to all at Ca'Dogaressa

<Content>Good hotel in nice location with thin walls. My wife and I just returned from a trip to Italy. We stayed in this hotel for two nights.We booked this hotel for the good reviews in TripAvisor and in general it was what we expected.The hotel is located in a nice and quiet district away from the expensive and crowded areas, just a few minutes walk from the train station . The room was beautifully decorated clean and spacious, breakfast in bed was good. The staff was friendly and helpful.This hotel has, in my opinion, a major thin wall problem, we could actually hear the conversations in the next room. Surprisingly no one mentioned it before. May be we just got the one bad room.

<Content>What a wonderful hotel! We booked our stay six months in advance directly with the hotel. With the declining dollar, it would have been better if we could have pre-paid! We arrived by rail and walked to the hotel with luggage in tow. It was only about a 10 minute walk from the train station. The hotel is located in a quiet residential section equi-distant from two vaporetti stops. On our trip home, we began to hear the horror stories of using the earplugs given on the flight to Europe to sleep in the noisy, tourist sections of the city! Thankfully, our stay at Ca' Dogeressa was very quiet.Our deluxe double was still a bit small, but luxuriously and tastefully decorated, including Murano glass chandeliers, sconces, and lamps.We were always greeted warmly each time we left and returned to the hotel. We received a lot of information from the desk about navigating the city.The breakfast was good, but a bit more sparse than our hotel breakfasts during this trip in Prague, Salzburg, and Villach.All in all, this hotel is wonderful!

My family and I spent a thoroughy relaxing week in this gem of a hotel located in the peaceful Cannareggio district. Paolo and Daniele are about the friendliest hotelliers I have ever come across and thier warmth and hospitality made it a holiday to remember. Breakfast was delicious, the rooms were bright  beautifully decorated and the location was thankfully quiet and away from the expensive and noisy tourist areas. I will most definitely return!!

<Content>Bellissimo !! I have just returned today from a week long trip to Venice with my mother and my two sisters. We stayed in the junior suite at Ca' Dogaressa which accommodated four people, the room was very spacious, clean and comfortable and the decor was of typical Venetian style. As we had a room with a canal view every morning as we opened the shutters the light poured in to the room, the sounds of the water in the canal and the daily ringing of the church bells was like something from a film it was so atmospheric. It was so nice to come back every day to the warmth and tranquil surroundings of Ca' Dogaressa  Paulo  Daniele were extremely inviting and very helpful at all times and encouraged us to use our limited Italian vocabulary which was nice. We noticed that the Venetians were generally happy to hear us attempt to speak a few words of Italian even if they were just Grazie Ciao Buongiorno etc.... When you choose to travel I am a firm believer in experiencing the food and culture of whatever country you are in and in this case the phrase when in Venice do what the Venetians do was very fitting. Every morning we had a very healthy continental breakfast which was served by Paulo  other very friendly staff, the breakfast consisted of fresh coffee  orange juice, brioche and yoghurt's which made a change from the Irish fry up. We ate very well for lunch and dinner and could not fault any of the restaurants that we ate in most which served delicious fresh fish and pasta, one word of advise is go looking down the little alley ways and also wherever you see locals eating you will know the food is good. The Ca' Dogaressa is in the quiet Cannaregio District which is a pleasant short walk to the busy market areas and is very central to all amenities including the water bus which brings you to wherever you want to go in the city and I must add it was great not to have the usual traffic and fumes. I could go on and on about what an amazing place Venice is and how friendly the people are but all I can say is it is a wonderful place to visit and we will definitely be back again and we will surely be staying in Ca' Dogaressa as this beautiful hotel added to the enjoyment of our holiday it was a pleasure to stay there and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting Venice !!! A+++

<Content>Very cute and a great staff We stayed in a standard room at the Ca' Dogaressa for two nights. It's an extremely charming hotel. Paolo, the owner (I think), is very nice and helpful, as is all the staff. The room wasn't very big as I expected but it was nicely decorated and very clean. The bathroom was a decent size and also very clean. My only complaint is that there was no shower curtain or even a hook to place the shower head on. So you had to hold the shower head thw whole time, which is difficult to do when you are trying to wash your hair. I know that it's common in Italy not to have a shower curtain, but I still didn't like it. It was very cold and I made a huge mess. The breakfast was good and satisfying. As I already mentioned, the staff was very friendly and helpful. When I forgot to pack a converter that would fit our laptop, Paolo immediately let me borrow one without me even asking. The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood, but it's extremely easy and fast to get down to San Marco, etc. Venice isn't very large so it wasn't a problem at all. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Highly recommended Stayed here for three nights with my mother just before Easter, and this was the perfect base for our visit - beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, and in an ideal location in a fascinating part of Venice, an easy 15 minute walk from the main bus station but away from the crowds. The staff are charming and go out of their way to be helpful - obviously they take pride in what they do. And we paid just 355 Euros for two people for three nights - an excellent deal given how expensive I had been led to believe Venice would be. Highly recommended.

<Content>An amazing find - the best of both worlds. LOCATION:This hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station, and about 15-20 minutes from the 'main' spots of the ponte rialto and the square. The walk is very nice, however, along some nice streets with plenty of shops to look at on the way.It is also in a more local area of Venice, so there are plenty of great value priced cafes in the area that are great for lunch. The gelato is also the cheapest in this area, which we found very important. HOTEL EXPERIENCE:We didn't think we had the right address when we first saw the hotel, as it is not much to look at from the outside. However, as soon as you step inside it is like walking into the lap of luxury. Everything is immaculately decorated with amazing tile, glass fixtures, etc. etc. It feels like you are in a 5 star hotel! There is always someone at the front desk too, which was great for such a small hotel. Our room was also decorated in a kind of antique Victorian style and the bathroom was simply amazing. Words have a hard time describing how nice it felt. The beds were hard, but every bed we stayed in across Europe was hard, so no surprise there. The breakfast was also included, and was made up of brioche (a fruit filled sticky croissant), croissants, buns, cereal, 3 different kinds of juice, and any kind of coffee you want (espresso, cafe au lait, latte, etc.). It was VERY tasty and a great way to start the day. They definitely pamper you the entire time. VALUE:Compared to the prices were were getting for other places that were much lower quality, this was probably the best bang for your buck in the entire city. If we go back we will DEFINITELY be staying here again.

<Content>Can't wait to return! This hotel was excellent, especially considering the price compared with other similar accommodation. It is located on a tranquil canal in a lovely area only 15-20 mins walk from the hustle and bustle of rialto / san marco. Very near vaporetto stops to get around town and also to the airport. Rooms are done out beautifully in venetian style with comfortable beds, spotless bathrooms and the hotel is very quiet at night. The hotel website is a good representation of the accommodation. Reception is manned 24 hours, all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Would not hesitate to recommend or return!

<Content>Best Hotel I LOVED this hotel. I travel to Venice quite a bit and have stayed in all sorts of hotels from the very best to the more ropey. This hotel is an absolute gem. Handy for everywhere - no need to worry about how close to St Marks you are, you are close enough and waterbuses are your friend - plus walking is the best way to see Venice and from this hotel to St Marks has some of the best streets for taking it all in. Its close to the station - worry not about your bags, its not that far maybe 5-10 mins walk - one bridge with teeny steps and then a left and you are there.We stayed in a Suite overlooking the canal, it was spacious, super clean - the bathroom was perfect. The staff are wonderful -could not have made us feel more welcome or at home. Breakfast by the canal watching everyone start their day was brilliant - I could have sat on all day.Perfect - I would try here before anywhere when going again. I've found my perfect hotel for Venice now.

<Content>great hotel Great hotel, wonderful bathroom with a nice bath top to take relaxing baths. Great room, nicely decorated with a nice view. The only thing we did not like is the time to/from the airport: A lot longer and more complicated that what the hotel website states.Nice people in the hotel

<Content>Great place, friendly staff This is a great place to stay. The owner Paolo is very helpful and he recommended some good and reasonably priced restaurants nearby. Rooms are amazing - 18 century venetian decor with modern bathroom. Well maintained and clean. Easy walk to the train and bus stations. Close to ferry stops. Friendly family feel atmosphere.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Reasonably priced for Venice. We went to Prague and Vienna as well during our trip and stayed at similarly priced establishments and Ca Dogaressa was the best by far!

<Content>Great welcome, very friendly and helpful We spent 2 nights in the Hotel Ca' Dogaressa and loved it. The hotel looks rather ordinary from the outside but the welcome we received at 10pm was brilliant. The receptionist spoke great English, and gave us a very quick but detailed overview of Venice, offered breakfast in bed and couldn't be more helpful. 24 hour service too. Venice was freezing but the hotel and room was perfect temperature during dayt and at night. The bathroom was amazing and marble floors throughout the room. The room, which was spotlessly clean throughout our stay, looked over the canal and had shutters which added to the romance of the stay. The hotel is located a little way out of the main areas to eat and drink although the waterbus stop is 2 minutes walk and the main bus and train stations only 10 - 15 mins, so I don't think it's worth staying any closer. The room was lovely and queit at night, and the noise of the hustle and bustle of the buses and other boats on the canal in the morning was amazing to hear. I would definately recommend the hotel purely on the basis of its complete charm and the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff.

<Content>A charming hotel Our bedroom and bathroom was decorated beautifully and with care. It was peaceful and comfortable, if a little small. The hotel is friendly and charming, with helpful and welcoming owners. There is the option to eat a simple, but decent, breakfast by the canal, which is very pleasant. We had a lovely stay and would certainly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Lives up to the hype We booked this hotel based on the reviews from TripAdvisor and were not disappointed. The staff is warm and friendly and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. The hotel is beautiful and the marble bathrooms are nothing short of amazing. There is a lovely area for breakfast each morning as well. Also, I think this hotel had the best maid service I've ever seen. We returned one evening to find that my clothes which had been lying on the desk were actually hung up in the closet! All this and the price was great too!While the location is far from San Marco Square, the area has a lovely neighborhood feel to it and is close to the train station as well as bus lines. I would highly recommend this hotel.

Our room was beautiful, clean and well maintained, Daniele and Paolo were very pleasant and helpful, and the coffee they served us for breakfast was superb! We will definitely stay in this hotel next time we visit Venice.

<Content>Wonderful Place My wife and I enjoyed our 2 night stay at this hotel and the next time we are in Venice, this place would definately be our first choice in booking a place to stay.The room was clean. The service and staff were excellent. You have internet access in the room, but you need a laptop. If you do not have a laptop, they are willing to rent one to you.As others have mentioned, the distance to the train and bus stations are totally walkable and even easier by the water bus. Which is something I found to be quite convienent.

<Content>Would be good with better beds. We picked this hotel as it was close to the train station and had received good reviews on tripadvisor. The walk from the train station isn鈥檛 bad if your luggage has good wheels and you have good energy for it, Check in was easy and our room had a nice European feel to it with lots of gold.Bathroom was nice with lots of tile. Shower is a bit tight, but worked out fine. Room was nice, our only major issue was with the bed itself. Twenty years ago it was standard practice in Europe to have doubles in every room and just push them together as needed for guests. This is still how this hotel operates and it made for two nights with very little sleep. The two twins were hard and had that horrible uncomfortable gap in the middle that kept us mostly apart for our planned two-day romantic trip to Venice. Since I am 6.2鈥?(not that tall really), my feet hung over the bed about 3 inches making for even more discomfort. It would be a good idea, especially being in romantic Venice, to have some full or queen size beds. At least a few for special requests, as we did prior to arriving. It is interesting that we have never come across this when traveling in Asian countries, rarely in the states, just mostly older, smaller hotels in Europe and some resorts in the Caribbean. Don鈥檛 get me wrong, I am not real picky, just need a comfy bed to sleep without my feet hanging over the bed and unable to cuddle with my wife. I am sure these beds pushed together have worked well for other travelers.The TV gets about 20 Italian channels and one German channel. Normally we don鈥檛 watch much TV, but this was a cold time of the year in Venice and we had to return to the room earlier then we would in the warmer months. The owner said we got CNN, but not in our room. Internet in our room was a big plus and we enjoyed that to unwind before bed.Breakfast was limited to Corn Flakes, crackers and croissants, but they made a great cappuccino and latte. They also had O.J., juices and bottled water out for breakfast.The staff was nice and helpful and the location was fine. However, the small hard beds would keep us from returning as we only got about 3 hours sleep our last night while tossing and turning in discomfort. If the bed situation was better and if they had at least one English TV channel, I might have given it 5 stars. Lots of potential for this hotel with a few upgrades.

<Content>Great place to stay This is a great place to stay in Venice. Very close to shopping, food stores, restaurants, and quick access to the vaporettos. Choose the junior suite and overlook the Cannaregio Canal in a spacious, attractive room. One major plus. Just a ten minute walk from the train station crossing only one bridge which has a ramp. No hefting luggage and paying extra for it on the extremely crowded vaporettos. Do yourself a favor.Only sort of down. Meager breakfast. Brioche, coffee, juice, yogurt, and cereal. Every day.

<Content>Great Value for Money Like all the other reviewers who praised this hotel they are right. The location is just a short walk from the bus station. The Orange stop for the airport on the Alilaguna line is 100 yards away. Our room was beautifully finished and exceptionally clean and the most silent hotel i have ever been in, not a squeak from the corridor's or other rooms. The desk staff were very helpful. We had juice, yogurt, and brioches for breakfast (no hot food or meat was available) inside as it was not possible to eat by the canal as others have done this year due to the cold weather. Thought the bed was a bit hard but it could just be me being old after being out walking about in Venice for 12 hours shopping !

<Content>Can't be beaten! What can I say, it has all been said before! For the money it can't be beaten.The owner is very keen to please and goes out of his way to make sure everything is just so. The only slight negative is a lack of lounge area, but we knew that before we booked. Area is great and everything is within walking distance. For the difference in money would recommend that you try and book the junior suites. Can be really difficult as this hotel is often fully booked. The owner told us that this has been a really busy year. I suppose recommendations on sites like this are the reason. So book early!

<Content>Very recommendable This hotel is a great option. The area is quite nice and close to the train station (walking distance even if you carry your luggage). You will have the chance to have breakfast next to a canal, which is a lovely experience. The staff, which is a family, is the most helpful people I have met during my trip to Europe. It was heavily raining at the day of our departure, and they offered us a couple of their umbrellas and didn't accept us to pay for them.

<Content>Delightful hotel All of the reviewers who praised this hotel are right - it's a gem. The location is great - just a short walk from the train station and the vaporetto stop in front of the station. The stop for the airport on the Alilaguna lline is even closer. Our room was beautifully furnished and exceptionally clean. The desk staff were very cordial and extremely helpful. We missed the fruit and platters of meat and cheese that had been provided at our hotels in Rome and Florence - breakfast here consisted of cornflakes, juice, yogurt, and brioches - but this was a very minor thing considering all of the other merits of this charming hotel. It was too cold while we were there to eat outdoors, which undoubtedly would be delightful in the warm weather.

<Content>Great Quiet Location and Friendly Staff The hotel is in a quiet section of Venice, but not too far away from the grand canal. They had a nice breakfast every morning along side the canal upon which they were locacted. Our room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. Above all this, however, was the helpful, freindly staff. They were able to help us arrange tours and answered all of our questions. They even went out of their way to make sure we had breakfast early in the morning on our departure day. I would highly recomend this hotel!

<Content>This hotel is a jewel. I recently stayed at the Hotel Ca' Dogaressa and I must agree with the others that have reviewed this hotel. I have stayed at several different hotels in Venice over the years and this one is by far the best one yet. I will definitely try to stay here next time. But, it is very often completely booked up, as are a lot of hotels in Venice. I loved the breakfast by the canal and the furnishings in the room. Well worth every Euro cent it cost.

<Content>A Peaceful Retreat My family of 4 (2 adults, 13 year old and 10 year old) spent 3 nights in Venice at the wonderful Hotel Ca' Dogaressa. On arriving by train, we immediately purchased our Vaporetto tickets at the booth near the station. This is a very cheap form of transportation around beautiful Venice. We then proceded to walk to the hotel along Lista di Spagna, over the Guglie Bridge and then left along Rio De Cananregio Canal. This was a very convenient location when you have 4 family members pulling luggage. We were greeted warmly by the owner and shown our beautiful suite overlooking the canal. It is a very spacious and clean suite, decorated in classical Venetian Style. I loved waking up in the morning to the sound of the water and the locals passing by in their boats. We enjoyed the breakfasts on the walkway directly in front of the hotel. Hotel Ca' Dogaressa is in the Cannaregio District. We had no difficulties in exploring Venice by foot and by vaporetto. Arriving mid-afternoon, we still had time to explore the Cannaregio District with its Synagogues, Museum of Jewish art, and the Fondamenta of the Madonna dell'Orto. We caught a vaporetta from Ca' D'oro stop to the Rialto Bridge where we found the small restaurant, Vecio Fritolin tucked away in the streets of San Polo. I had organised a surprise birthday for my husband. Friends from Australia who were residing in the UK surprised him with their presence. The next day, we met our friends at the Rialto Bridge, purchased bread rolls, cold meats and fruit at the Markets for lunch then commenced our exploration of Venice - visiting San Marco, S Maria della Salute, vaporetto ride down the Grande Canal, shopping in San Polo for a Venetian mask, and finally dinner in San Marco. The highlight of the day of course was cruising the canals of San Marco in a Gondola.Sadly, our friends left Venice but we continued to explore Venice and the islands of Burano and Murano on our last day.The owner kindly gave my husband a bottle of wine for his birthday. When my husband and I return to Venice, we will definately return to Hotel Ca' Dogaressa, a friendly hotel away from the bustling tourist centre but only a 20 minute stroll or a short vaporitto ride to many wonderful sites. Hotel Ca' Dogaressa is very suitable for families.

<Content>Be careful - you might get ripped off I never got a chance to stay at this hotel and never will. I booked a room for 3 nights for this September but unfortunately had to cancel. I called the hotel and asked them to cancel my reservation. This month I got a credit card statement which shows that they charged me for one night stay. When I contacted them to dispute the charge, they claimed that the only way you can cancel is by email or fax. That would have been fine if the person I was talking to made it clear that in addition to cancelling over the phone I had to email them or fax them my cancellation. This hotel is looking to rip people off and isn't considering that someone might be traveling without any access to email or fax. I think a phone call should have been enough.

<Content>Don't go, we want to keep this secret! Having read the previous reviewers comments we chose the Dogaressa for our 3 night break to Venice. What a delight it was. The rooms were spotless and beautifully furnished and decorated. Murano hand made glass and antiques belied the miserly 3 stars this hotel has been awarded. From the moment you arrive it's obvious this is a family run business, with attention to detail, warmth and genuine care for the guests in all that they do. Breakfast is a great start to the day, taken (in the Summer) outside the hotel on the canalside, with rolls, croissants and crackers, cheese, jams and nutella. There was also yogurt, a good selection of teas, coffees and fruit juices. The view from our 1st floor suite was of the canal, and its proximity to 2 vaporetto stops was a real bonus. The area is away from the mad throngs of tourists, and all the better for it. If you need a rest, you'd certainly not be kept awake at night by street noise. We don't go back to the same place twice, but we're seriously considering taking a few rooms with friends for our wedding anniversary next year. My wife and I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.

Booked after reading all the 5 star reviews, everything about just right. Breakfast served on the Canal bank, sun terrace on the roof, staff friendly, location is just 2 stops from main Bus station Roma, and Hotel only few minuites walk along the bank from Bus stop. Also great cocktail bar over other side of canal only 5 euro each, which is great price.Would stay again at the C脿 Dogaressa Hotel and would visit Venice again in a heart beat.

<Content>Perfect hotel I can only add to the previous reviews, by supporting this perfect little hotel by the canel. Although definitely off the beaten track, it was a nice stroll to the main sights and it was lovely to be away from all the tourists (I've never been to a busier city!).Although our room was not ready when we arrived at 11.45am, we were able to use the toilet by reception (even have a shower if we wanted) and we were both supplied with free bottles of water to prepare us for the day. We were also provided with a complimentary bottle of bubbly because we were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary (thought this was a very special touch) and much enjoyed on the sun terrace.All in all a lovely hotel, with very friendly and helpful staff. Only down side if I had to mention were lack of stand up shower (had to sit in the bath to us shower hose) and no tea/coffee facilities in the room.

<Content>Fabulous little hotel There is little I can add to the chorus of wonderful reviews for this hotel. Yes, it is a bit off the beaten track, but that is part of its charm. We loved being in a neighborhood rather than a touristy area. Sitting by the canal for breakfast and watching parents walk children to school and people going to work was a treat. Paolo is the Guardian of the Corner and knows almost everyone who passes. I'm a crank about noise, and it was quiet as a pin even though we were overlooking the canal. The decor is lovely, and everything is scrupuously clean. There is no elevator so if one has trouble with steps, you might avoid this hotel.We absolutely loved our stay here. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Venice. The ghetto is a neat place too. It is an oasis of calm in the city, and there are some wonderful Jewish art stores there.

<Content>Romantic Stylish Just Perfect! My husband and I have recently spent a blissful week at this wonderfully romantic 鈥榖outique鈥?hotel. Located alongside a peaceful canal just a short stroll away from the delightful bustle of a daily market, stylish shops, cafes and restaurants, it really was the most perfect setting. The hotel itself is so elegant (inside!) with its wonderfully stylishd茅cor and the friendly helpful staff made us feel so welcome. We stayed in room 8 a 鈥榮tandard鈥?double although it was far from being just standard with its charming gilded, painted furniture, Baroque mirrors and glass chandeliers! After spending the day amongst the breath taking Venetian architecture/interiors how perfect to return to the Ca Dogaressa and relax in its elegant surroundings. The room itself was spotlessly clean and offered every modern amenity to make our stay so blissfully comfortable. During our week (in June) Venice experienced a heat wave so we were very grateful for the air conditioning which although had independent controls in the room, it was automatically set at the perfect temperature particularly for sleeping (no waking up during the night shivering)! The bed was so comfortable with immaculate bed linen and white towels in the bathroom, all which were changed daily. The shower was spacious and powerful and included a hand held attachment for us girls who don鈥檛 like to get our faces wet whilst washing our hair! It was also the little added extras such as the powerful hairdryer in the bathroom, plenty of coat hangers in the wardrobe as well as a mini-bar fridge and safe which made this such a perfect choice of hotels. There was only one thing I would have added but it鈥檚 a minor detail and that is a full length mirror, (for us girls trying to compete with the immaculate Italians a full length mirror would certainly help) like I said a minor point! The best start to the day was our leisurely Ca Dogaressa breakfast sitting by the canal with fresh apricot filled pastries, fruit juicesand yoghurt - fantastic! As for the coffee it was most certainly the best in Italy particularly the espresso 鈥?highly recommended for thatkick-start! We also discovered some fabulous restaurants during our stay only a short walk away (manageable even in heels!) and I had no problem as a Vegetarian. Do try the pumpkin ravioli in the Alla Palazzina restaurant (literally at the end of the street from the Ca Dogaressa鈥?the address is Alla Palazzina Ponte delle Guilie Cannareggio). It鈥檚such a romantic trattoria where you can eat under a vine-covered pergola along side the canal with pretty glass votive candles on each table. Like many we choose the Ca Dogaressa from the wonderful comments on Tripadvisor and booked directly via the hotel鈥檚 web site, which couldn鈥檛 have been easier. It certainly lived up to its excellent TripAdvisor reputation and in many ways far surpassed our expectations particularly on the excellent location. We are now counting the days until our return. If we had the choice of any hotelin Venice (money no object) it would still be the Ca Dogaressa!
