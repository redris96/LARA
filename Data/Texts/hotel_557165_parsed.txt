<Content>Outstanding value; very good location! The public transport links in Berlin are so good that all areas of this beautiful city were quickly and easily accessible. The hotel is basic but scrupulously clean - the equivalent in terms of facilities to a British Travelodge. Incredibly good value, especially as the prices include an unlimited buffet breakfast. My husband and i would certainly stay there again!

<Content>Great Value We stayed at the Lichtburg in August and i have to say that it offers great value for money and is very close to public transport to get to all parts of this massive city. The breakfast was great , offering hot and cold food and the rooms were comfortable and clean.Not the most modern of hotels but very conveniant and helpful staff when we required more pillows.Would deffinatly reccommend this for people looking for good value for money. The hotel is situated on a quiet side street so a good nights sleep is guaranteed.

<Content>Great location and great breakfast.... Just had a long weekend in Berlin with my mum. Hotel location was excellent with a U-bahn station 5 mins walk and bus stops near by. The public transport is incredibly easy to use with most bus stops showing which buses leave, where they go and how often. Can get single/return or day tickets and is cheaper than public trasnsport in England. Once you have a decent map you will negotiate the buses no problem. You can buy tickets on board or at machines which have an english option on the screen.This hotel was located just off the kurfurstendam, which is a long road leading to the Europa Centre - shoppng area and square with buskers, fab ice cream cafe's and amazing old church with modern chapel attached, which looks ugly from the outside but is amazing inside. The kurfstendam starts with the most designer shops and becomes more high street the further towards the Europa centre you get. Eating - recommend Charlottenburg area- try and wonder off the beaten track and find some great authentic german cuisine and beers. Restaurants off Kurfurstendam are more expensive.Visit the statue in the centre on a big roundabout -forgotten its name. Climb it and get the most amazing views at the top, also check out the rebuilt cathedral- beautiful.The hotel was basic but adequate and we were hardly there, en-suite bathroom was fresh and clean and tv in room. Breakfast was great - fill up ! No bar in hotel. There are bars and restaurants nearby if you do not want to stray too far....

<Content>Okay, Okay, Okay I told my travel agent to find someplace clean, affordable, and near a metro stop. This was exactly that. The place was clean, but the decor could use some freshening. The beds were comfy. The breakfast was included and exceeded my expectations. It was pretty much everything you would want in a continental breakfast and even had some additions like scrambled eggs. Food in Berlin is expensive so it was nice to not worry about one meal daily. I would recommend this place and overall it was exactly what I expected.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay I have just got back from a long weekend in Berlin during which time my husband and I stayed at Agon Lichtburg. We were both impressed with the location and value of the hotel. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was also very good. The room we had (standard double) was nothing fancy but I was very impressed in particular with the bathroom fittings (bath, shower, basin and toilet) - they must have been recently installed as they were like new!I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are after a luxurious getaway - it is more suitable if you are wanting a comfy base within easy access to connections and within walking distance to Ku'damm for your time in Berlin.

<Content>Did not care much for the place From Oxford UK Date Oct 2007The place was not so clean. The room had a bad smell. There was hair on my sheets. Only some of the staff were friendly. I did not feel real comfortable here. I had to clean the room myself. It was good we did not spend much time in the room. The breakfast was nice!

<Content>Good base but nothing special I stayed here last month and found the hotel to be OK if nothing spectacular. The carpets are a liitle worn and the hotel has a slightly tired feel to it but it was clean and the staff were helpful and spoke good English. The rooms were a good size (as all German hotel rooms seem to be) but there was no Enlish language channel on the TV. Breakfast was fine and overall the hotel is pretty good value for 68 euros a night. Sitauted just of Kurfurstendam and 5 mins from U-bahn Adenauerplatz, it is well located for exploring the city. If I was staying in this part of Berlin again, I would give the hotel some consideration.

<Content>Basic but OK Went with a bunch of lads to celebrate a 40th birthday (perhaps lads is stretching it!) Hotel is basic but comfortable enough and near enough to the U-Bahn to make it easy to travel around. Staff are friendly and breakfast alright. Berlin itself is great.

<Content>Good Location, Friendly Staff, Excellent Value Although not fancy, the accomodations were clean, comfortable and in an excellent location which was both attractive and convenient to shopping, restaurants and public transit. I found the staff to be helpful and friendly - they tolerated my poor attempts at German with good humor and fair English. We arrived quite late, well after midnight and found that the night clerk had been on the lookout for us as he walked out to meet us when I pulled up in front. The downstairs lobby is small but functional and the hallways are spartan, no extra money was spent on furnishing/decorating - my boyfriend wanted to know if we were staying in a barracks. However, once in the room, we were comfortable with feather comfortors, platform beds, a squeaky clean bathroom and shower gel provided by the hotel which I liked so much, I have been seeking to buy it for myself. The buffet breakfast provided is very good - a full buffet with a variety of hot  cold food items - and an excellent value, especially if you consider the price of the room. If you exit the lobby to the street, turn left and proceed one block, you will find a convenient, well stocked little grocery store which should have just about anything you require at a reasonable price. Just before crossing over to the store, you will see a bistro/restaurant on the left - I don't recall the name but the food smelled wonderful and everyone inside appeared to be having a good time. Unfortunately we did not get to eat there but I was told that it is quite good. If/when I return to Berlin, I will stay here again.

<Content>good location this hotel is in an excellent location and we had a good stay, but there are some draw backs. if you want clean and somewhere to sleep and a good location this is for your you. if you want luxury then it is not for you.the hotel is not that modern, there are no tea and coffee making facilities or hair dryer in the room. the room we stayed in did however have a nice modern upto date bathroom. just a shame there was no hair dryer. the breakfast was good and plentyful. the staff were nice and polite and helped with queries that we had. the room we stayed in was on the top floor and the lift stopped at the floor below. interestingly the room had a wall dividing the beds and the tv was at one end and could only get cnn as an english speaking channelhaving said that we did have a nice stay even though it sounds like i am moaning. the hotel was 2 min walk from the underground and just round the corner from ku'damm.if all you want is a room to go to bed and have a wash and fill your belly before you hit the berlin sights then stay here.

<Content>A good value for the money This hotel is located in the western part of the city, two blocks south of Adenauer Platz on the Kudamm. The hotel's proximity to the bus and subway lines was a real plus. Our room was small, but this was made up for by other amenities such as the recently remodelled bathroom and generous closet space. We stayed in November and the room temperature was quite satisfactory. The reception area was brightly lit and the breakfast room was easy to find on the first floor of the hotel. There was free internet service available near the lobby area. Although the broadband connection was a bit slow, at least there was internet service available and we rarely had to wait in line to use it. The breakfast was served at 7 AM, which was a plus since we had a busy schedule planned each day. There was a plentiful variety of food and an excellent choice of beverages. The morning receptionist was quite helpful and she was familiar with our name right away from the reservation list when we checked in the first day. We were able to check into our room by 10 AM, which was an unexpected plus. The evening guest clerk wasn't as friendly and felt compelled to correct any mispronunciations of our broken German. We would definitely stay at this hotel again based on the value for the money and the excellent location.A bit of quick advice on the bus service: You can buy your tickets in the subway station at Adenauer Platz. Use bus #109 which will take you a mile or two east to the Zoologischer Garten (Zoological Garden) transportation hub where you can get off and catch a bus or use the above ground S-Bahn rail system to travel practically anywhere in the city. Bus #100 takes you to most of the popular sites such as the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate. Bus line #200 takes you to the Potsdamer Platz area and other sites to the south. There are plenty of free maps available that show the bus, subway and rail routes. A Tageskarte (one day ticket) works for all three transportation services.

<Content>friendly hotel Stayed at this hotel june 2006 the hotel stairways a bit tatty rooms dated but really clean towels clean bathroom was immaculate, the restaurant was nice with an adequate selection of food could not fault the staff on reception they were really friendly the hotel was in a good location for shops bars and eating places also for transport the taxi cost us 5 euros for 5 of us to the zoo gartens where we got the hop on hop off tour bus for 20 euros which was worth it as it took us to all the main sights where you could get off and look around then jump back on the next bus which were every 15 mins. I would recommend the graffitti bar up from the hotel on the ku dam road it was excellent for food staff friendly cocktails were great for 5 Euros. I think this hotel is ideal for a couple of nights in Berlin if your just there for the sights it was clean and cheap and i would stay there again if i go back to Berlin

<Content>Excellent value for money We stayed at Hotel Lichtburg in February 2006 and were extremely impressed with the service and value for money. We paid 拢35 for a double room per night,which included breakfast. The room was clean and spacious. Although the bathroom only had a hand held shower hose, the bath was a good size. Further the breakfast was excellent and the hotels location was an added bonus. Situated 500 meters from the Adenaurplatz metro station it was also situated just off Kurfustendamm Strasse, the main shopping area of the city. We were suprised to find that we were staying very near to all the major designer outlets, Boss, Channel, etc. Suffice to say i would reccomend this hotel to anyone travelling to Berlin, especially budget minded individuals.

<Content>Basic but Good Good location round corner from K'dam although not within walking distance of most sites. Public transport is very good and frequent though. Take the 109 from the airport to Adenaur Plaz and save yourself some taxi money. Nice clean room, average size with a telly. Breakfast in the hotel is good and abundant and the morning receptionist was very helpful. The same could not be said about the afternoon receptionist who was very unhelpful and did not smile once. Rooms were not airconditioned which would have been a bonus in the heat of July, but the overall package was a bargain so we cannot complain. If you are looking for somewhere to stay for two or three nights, and not expecting luxury, this is your place. We would go back, on price alone.

<Content>Excellent price-quality-ratio It was the 2nd time we stayed in this hotel. It is situated in a quit street near the Kurf眉rstendam. There are some rather good restaurants in the surrounding. The staf is very helpful and if you have certain wishes concerning your room they realy try to realize these. The breakfast was very good and abundant. Use of the internet is free. We booked via BOOKINGS, so there were no additional costs.Very recommandable.

<Content>Good base Very clean and on quiet side street. Helpful desk staff. Good breakfast with plenty of variety. Good base for sighting if you are happy with plain decor. No bar and no mini bars in bedrooms. There are no desk staff at night. We wanted to purchase a bottle of water on our return one night, but this was not possible. There's a small shop in Adenauer Platz subway which is open until 9 or 9.30 p.m. Although there is a subway at Adenauer Platz (U7), best transport to start journey eastwards into city is by bus from Adenauer Platz. Buy day (or longer) travel ticket at subway station which can be used on buses, U-Bahn, S-Bahn and trams. Public transport system is frequent, clearly signed and everything links up. Most sights are not within walking distance of Hotel Lichtburg. Lots of nearby cafes/restaurants/bars: we were happy with all those we tried, particularly Oscar's at 22 Brandenburgische Strasse, round the corner from the hotel. Tapas food, very friendly people, great decor, fantastic atmosphere, suitable for all ages.

<Content>Very nice stay This hotel is close to Adenauer Platz subway station, so it provides quick access to the rest of the city in just minutes. It is a more residential area, so very calm and quiet. Lots of little restaurants around. Easy access from the airport. The rooms are very clean and the breakfast is very good.
