<Content>Great hotel! My husband and I stayed two nights in December and loved this hotel. It is in a great location- close to the train station as well as all the major sights. When we were there the Piazza was under construction, but since it was the holidays we didn't hear any construction noise. It is not marked very well- but we found it pretty easily, a very short walk from the train station.The room and bathroom were good sized, the bed was very comfortable and the shower was the biggest shower we had among three different hotels in Italy. The breakfast was top notch- cold and hot selections and fresh coffee/lattes/cappachinos which was really nice. Overall there are no complaints, we really enjoyed the comforts and location of this hotel and would recommend for the value.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We have just returned from Florence , Italy. We stayed in Santa Maria Novella Hotel for 3 nights. It is a small lovely hotel. We stayed in a superior room with a view to Piazza Santa Maria and the size of the room is adequate. The room is very clean. You are able to adjust the room temperature to your need ( unlike other hotels we stayed during our trip to Italy , which were way too hot). The hotel provided good quality shower gel and lotions. The breakfast is also good. One thing wioth to note is the construction at the Piazza outside the hotel starts at 7:00am and we did hear some noise. It did not bother us since we leave the hotel early every day. For dinner, you can try the restuarant Trattoria al Trebbio which is a few steps away from the hotel. The food is good and the price is vey reasonable.

<Content>Good hotel in an attractive location First impression is enhanced by the stunning location by Santa Maria Novella. Also conveniently located to walk to all the main places of interest in Florence.I had an enormous, well furnished room with a stunning marble bathroom, all in immaculate condition. Very good public rooms which seemed to be little used. Staff were helpful and breakfast was good. In the evening scented candles were lit in the reception area - a nice touch, typical of the attention to detail shown by the hotel. A minor criticism - the bedroom was a bit dark and could have felt cosier.

<Content>loved the hotel The staff was pleasant, Marco, was excellent. I thought the room size was large, but not as spacious as suggested. The breakfast was top notch and the staff was exceptional. Since we both had terrible colds the first few days, the staff prefered tea for my husband to take to our room.I loved the view of Santa Maria Church, and the construction did not bother us. A few nights it was noisy, but the staff took care of it, when we complained. The beds were very comfortable...I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Pretty good Good location right in the centre of Florence, only a short walk from the station, but a very inconspicuous entrance, we walked past it once. Nicely decorated and furnished. Major building works going on next door, but we didn't get disturbed by any noise.Unusually for Italy there was a kettle in the room, but only tea bags, no coffee. Pleasant helpful staff, nice breakfast. I'd be happy to stay here again.

<Content>A place that still stays within my heart! It has been nearly 2 years since we stayed at the Santa Maria Novella in Florence. It was some time ago, but it is a memory that is as clear to me today as it was when I was last there. I had been meaning to write this review for 2 years now, but didn't think that I would do it justice....when I think about it, my heart just melts....and I have to thank the Hotel Santa Maria Novella for leaving such an impression on me still to this day.I did ALOT of research before going on this trip, as accomodation to me is VERY important. If I feel uncomfortable, it will wreck a trip for me....so i really researched the accomodation before i left for Europe. This was not my first time to Florence either, and I had stayed in a beautiful hotel the previous trip, but wanted to try another hotel.When I first read about it, some people were saying that it was a bit out of the way, a bit close to the train station, and had some drunks congregate out in the park area outside the hotel.All these things were not true.We were in walking distance to all of the sites, and yes we were close to the train station, which was great as we could walk easily to the hotel from the train. Mind you it was not so close that we could ever hear the train, or even see the station. And I didn't see any drunks loitering in the park!From the moment I stepped into the hotel I knew it was going to be perfect. The outside was non descript....a door with a small , perfectly polished, brass plate saying  Hotel Santa Maria Novella. The entry was inviting and had a feeling of quiet Florentine elegance. The staff were very friendly and most helpful. We were given an absolutely beautiful room. It was like I had walked into an Italian renaissance dream. Big huge windows that opened up to the front of the park opposite, framed by the most sumptious curtains I had ever seen in red and a royal yellow, almost gold colour. The bed was covered in equally beautifully printed fabrics of reds, creams, blues....with lovely fresh, perfectly pressed sheets. The bed had the same fabric draped from the ceiling, behind and down the sides of the bed....it felt sumptous, decadent, and story book. I felt like Cinderella....Florentine style! The bathroom was marble and felt fresh, clean and spacious, with big white fluffy towels.I would lie in the comfortable king size bed at night with the windows open, looking out the window at the beautiful night sky and the big bright moon. The rooms were beautifully appointed, and I felt very privilged being there. The Hotel has lovely rooms to sit in and have a drink, read a paper, or just relax in, if you chose to do that.The breakfast that they served was fantastic, one of the best that we had while we were travelling. A nice variety, quality items, and in a beautiful breakfast room. So in keeping with the feeling of being a guest in a Florentine Villa of the Italian Aristocracy.The Hotel Santa Maria Novella is exactly what I was looking for.... It was like I had stepped into a world of days gone by, in a city of romance and history....where you could feel the magic, the excitement of what once was there, what still lingers in the quiet streets when the shops are closed....and what you feel when you touch the stone of the buildings and walk the paving that was put there so long ago.....Thank you for giving us memories that will stay with us forever.Hotel Santa Maria Novella is a special place to stay, in a special city.

<Content>Very Nice, Convenient Location. We did have some trouble finding the hotel because the only sign is small and slightly hidden by a decorative planter. The location is excellent and close to the train station. The room was beautiful and very clean. We overlooked the piazza which is currently under construction. We could not hear any construction noise in our room. The staff were not very friendly but Florence is easy to get around so we did not require much assistance.

<Content>A truly outstanding hotel, incredible value for money I'm reluctant to heap more praise on this hotel, in case it gets so popular that I can never stay there again, but it really is superb. 拢140 a night for the kind of room that, in London, would cost you upwards of 拢400.The staff are fantastically helpful (even letting us go to our rooms two hours before check-in time), rooms and bathrooms luxurious (including toiletries from the nearby Farmacia Di Santa Maria Novella) and breakfast wonderful. Our rooms looked directly across to Santa Maria Novella church, one of the most beautiful sights in all of Florence.If you're arriving by train, it is about two minutes' walk from Florence SMN station.This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in, and at these prices (even at peak season) you would be mad to stay anywhere else in Florence.

<Content>Brilliant In Every Way This hotel was just perfect in every way. The location was very close to the railway station. All staff were equally professional and helpful. The decor throughout the hotel was beautiful and very much in keeping with the ambience of Florence. We were booked in on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast was exceptional, both in terms of quality and choice.Overall this accommodation exceeded all our expectations.We would struggle to find any opportunities for this hotel to improve other than the lift was out of action for most of the time we were there.

<Content>Amazing Staff We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights on our honeymoon. Florence was our second stop. Here is the breakdown:Arrival: There is a TINY sign on the hotel making it difficult to find if you don't know the specific address. We arrived at the SMN train station and knew it was a short walk to the hotel but once we were in the piazza we walked around aimlessly. Ironically we decided to stop and ask for directions and we went into the hotel! After seeing the carpet with the hotel name on it we felt stupid but relieved to have found it. The check in girl was a dynamo! She spoke a number of languages and helped us with restaurants, a map, and museum bookings.Room: After a TINY hotel in Paris, we were pleasantly surprised by the room in Florence. It was a standard room but had a huge bathroom. with an enormous shower. Lots of storage too. Air conditioning worked well. The only flaw was that the bed was SUPER hard and we had a dificult time sleeping that first night. Afterwards it wasn't so bad but both the mattress and the pillows are pretty firm. All in all we loved the hotel and assuming that we're willing to put up with the hard bed, the staff and facilities more than made up for it. It was a very convenient location, close to all the major sights.

<Content>Best Small Hotel We stayed in the Hotel Santa Maria Novella in Florence for 4 days this July. It is exceptional in many ways. The location is excellent, between the train station of the same name and the center of town. This proved great because Florence is very much a walking town. The building has good esthetics both inside and out. Our room was as large as most hotel rooms we have used in the US but was wonderfully decorated in an old-world style. And what a beautiful bathroom! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Don鈥檛 miss the breakfast buffet which is included with the room. If you want a nice view of the piazza and Florence, check out the roof-top patio. The cost per day was the least of our Italian vacation. During any future visits to Florence, we would stay at the Hotel Santa Maria Novella.Frank  Lisa

<Content>Lovely Hotel This summer we traveled through Europe for a month and stayed at wonderful hotels, however, we have voted Hotel Santa Maria Novella as being one of the best hotels. Everything about Hotel Santa Maria Novella was beautiful. The entire staff is friendly, and extremely accommodating. The rooms are elegant. You truly feel you are on vacation. It's centrally located. The train station is literally across the street. The best part is that you can walk to Florence's main attractions from here. And given that the train station is just steps from the hotel, we decided to take a day trip to Pisa (another awesome addition to our itinerary). We stayed six nights at Hotel Santa Maria Novella. The breakfast's staff was warm, friendly and in my opinion, just wanted us to have a wonderful stay. They were just lovely. We happened to be there for St. John's Day (a religious holiday). The coolest thing was to go to the roof top after returning from dinner and enjoying the fireworks!!! As far as places to eat, the hotel staff will give you the best restaurant recommendations.We will definitely return to Hotel Santa Maria Novella!!!

<Content>wonderful hotel We stayed at this wonderful hotel for six nights over the festival of San Giovanni Baptista the Patron Saint of Venice. From the moment we entered the air cnditioned lobby to the moment we left we felt we were as near to heaven as it was possible to be this side of the grave. The rooms were ideal - spacious and welcoming. The beds were large and comfortable, the plumbing excellent, the air conditioning quietly efficient. The view from the windows overlooking the piazza and church was stunning as were the views of the city from the roof top. The staff were unfailingly courteous and helfpul both at reception and in the breakfast room. La prima collazione was outstanding removing the need for lunch!. The staff at breakfsat were considerably more civilised than some of the guests with whom they had to deal. Our time in Florence was going to be good whatever the accommodation. Staying here turned the experience from good to absolutely superbly outstanding. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone and we thank the staff for making our stay so happy. Thank you.

<Content>Love love love this hotel Decided to book this hotel despite advices not to stay near the train station, and boy am I glad I went ahead and stayed there. Love the place the moment I stepped into the lobby, small but very lovely. The staff was helpful, accomodating and friendly, except for this guy who slammed the phone infront of us, I suspect some guests were making prank calls to the reception. But he was very nice to us. Room was great! Huge room with huge bathroom, very spacious and very beautiful. It felt so luxurious after the many tiny rooms we had in our Italy trip. Location was good, just a stone's throw away from the shopping area, and sights but then again, Florence is pretty easy to walk everywhere. Waitress in the breakfast room was eager to please and friendly. Breakfast room is again very lovely, a nice way to start the day. I have no complaints at all about this hotel. If I ever return to Florence, I will definitly check myself in again. The only not so perfect thing was that our room has no view. It faces the building next door which is undergoing some restoration/upgrading work. Also, works at the piazza infront of the hotel is still not completed but this is all no fault of the management. Saw people hanging around the area but felt very safe. Everyone minded their own business.

We will definately stay at this hotel again. The staff were very friendly and very helpful, the room was beautiful and the buffet breakfast was amazing! We chose this hotel as it is quietly situated but within very easy walking distance of all Florence has to offer. A couple of weeks before our arrival we asked the hotel if they could pre-book Uffizi tickets for us and we were very glad that they did as the queues are horrendous for daily tickets!! There are still renovations going on in the piazza but it's not an issue once inside the hotel. The hotel is conveniently situated for arrival by train, just a 5 minute walk. All in all, a really wonderful place to stay! We'll be back!!

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during our honeymoon - for a stop between Montepulciano and the Amalfi Coast. The location is amazing - you can walk everywhere, including the train station. We were in Florence 6 months ago and stayed at the Excelsior down by the river and this location was just as good if not better, and the hotel was half the price. The room was huge, and really nice, great amenities. Exactly what you would expect from a 4 star, but not the price. The only disappointment was that they knew it was our honeymoon and didn't acknowledge it (the hotel in Rome and on the Amalfi coast sent us champage and fruit/chocolate).

<Content>What a find! When we were planning our trip to Florence, we were concerned with finding the right hotel. Having never been in Florence, or Italy for that matter, we felt we were shooting in the dark. Well, the Santa Maria Novella was simply outstanding. Clean, convenient location,and a wonderful staff that was very accomodating. We were warmly greeted upon check-in. They were going to put us in a room overlooking the piazza, but were more than happy to honor our request for a room in the back of the hotel so we wouldn't have to deal with noise. We stayed in Room 411. No view, but we were not there to see Florence from our hotel! The hotel were able to get us the necessary reservations to Accademmia and the Uffuzi, although they had to work to accomodate our timing. Also, they recommended wonderful restaurants...highly recommend Bella Mario.To the staff...thanks for making our stay in Florence so delightful.

<Content>Bellisimo!!! We could not have been more pleased! The location is perfect- less than a 5 min walk to the Duomo (city centre) and less than a 5 min walk from the train station. The hotel entrance is very discreet (which we loved), but upon entering one immediately appreciates the quiet luxury.We were deeply, deeply impressed by the hotel reception staff - Laura and others whose names we unfortunately didn't get. We were always greeted warmly, respectfully, graciously... Five stars! They treated us like good friends.Drinks in the green sitting room were fabulous, breakfast was a 100 (on a scale of 1-10!)... steamed milk for American coffees, delicious cappucinos, other drinks made to order. The bell staff were delightful... we just can't praise the Santa Maria Novella Hotel enough.We were to get engaged in Florence; unfortunately my fiance developed an unexpected, terrible allergy and it was not the appropriate time for him to 'pop the question' - still I have to write that it was the most wonderful, wonderful experience we have ever had in an overseas hotel. And we have been to many.Thank you, thank you, thank you Hotel Santa Maria Novella!Rest assured, we will be back time and time again. While sitting on the private patio, listening to the church bells ring out, we spoke about our future children coming to this hotel in years to come. Our private dinners on the patio remain a beautiful memory.You have won our hearts!Affectionately,Todd and Sara

<Content>Save time - just book this hotel! We booked this place as a package on Last Minute and I checked the reviews on Tripadvisor beforehand, pretty much all of them raving about this place.They weren't lying either. The hotel is stylish but not pretentious, its staff is helpful, friendly and always around and the place is simply impeccably clean. We were upgraded upon arrival, which was a nice gesture, although the sceptic in me thought all the rooms probably looked the same.The location of the hotel is great as it is only five minutes from the train station and about the same, a little more, from the Duomo. Breakfast, although largely an 'Italian' affair, is good and the service was superfriendly. The front desk will help you out with any questions and booking nice places to eat. The only downside, if you like, is that the square outside is being done up and looks more like a building site than anything else, but obviously this isn't much to do with the hotel and if you're stuck looking for squares in Italy, then you should consider upgrading your contacts.I would strongly recommend this place as you won't get better value for money in Florence.

<Content>Wow - what a lovely hotel!! My new husband and I have just returned from a 5 night stay at what I can only describe as an excellent hotel. We came for our honeymoon and the hotel really made the trip. The location is brilliant - pretty much a 5 minute walk from all the main sights plus the train station and CAF stop (from where you can do many day trips). On arrival we found that as our honeymoon the hotel had upgraded our room to split level suite with no extra charge - what a treat. Room was spotless and thanks to the great cleaners remained that way all week. The breakfasts were very good and the staff in general couldn't be more helpful - providing us with maps, directions and that all important plug adapter we had forgotten to pack. With regards to trips - suggest you find the CAF tourist office (5 mins walk away). They were very helpful and recommend the following trips - Siena and the chianti wine tour. Wouldn't recommend the Pisa trip as really there is nothing there but the leaning tower and its probably much cheaper to do this by yourself on the train.Loads of places to eat in Florence - 2 great pizza/past restaurants just outside the hotel's front door which were great.Would highly recommend both this hotel and Florence as a place to visit - great trip!!!

<Content>True Gem--Put this on Your List. This is a fabulous hotel; worthy of its 4 stars! The hotel is elegant but not stuffy. The public rooms have beautiful art and furnishings. The rooms are large, airy and keep out the noise from the square. Bathroom was huge and exquisite. Great toiletries! The breakfast, included, is among the tops we've had (and we are fussy when it comes to food!). The staff is very helpful; the locaton (walking distance from the train station, but in a plaza that will be charming when construction is completed) is perfect. We walked everywhere from the hotel, easily. As the woman in 307 referenced in another review, I caution that there are two sets of rooms (306/307 and 106/107) which are adjoining rooms separated by only a single door that fails to provide any soundproofing. Hotel management are looking into this situation, which they did not realize. If you desire a quiet sojourn, simply ask for another room. Even with the noise, we loved our stay at this lovely hotel and hope to return.

<Content>Well appointed hotel This was a first rate hotel with very fine appointments---furnishings especially. The staff was very helpful and followed through on all of our requests with no problems. The work on the plaza makes the area look unkempt, but I imagine that when that is done, this will be a truly amazing location. There were a few too many people sitting around outside (a pub a few doors down had several drunk people sitting outside who made me nervous), but the hotel is within a reasonable walk to all attractions.

<Content>A Perfect Hotel! We spent 6 glorious days at Hotel Santa Maria Novella over Easter. The hotel was full of travelers but the service was personal and impeccable. Our daughter, who had been living in Florence for several months, warned us that European hotels were less than impressive. She got to the hotel before we did and called us to say the place was amazing. She was right! The furnishings were lovely, the amenities were wonderful. We had a Junior Suite (room 621) for the 3 of us. It wasn't enormous but it suited us perfectly. Best of all we had two balconies - a small balcony overlooking the rooftops and a larger balcony overlooking the Piazza Santa Maria Novella. Glorious! (The construction should soon be finished in the square and then it will be perfect, although my husband loved watching the workmen while he relaxed!) A few steps away was a rooftop terrace that looked out to the Duomo. We could see the fireworks from the exploding cart on Easter morning. I had read some reviews that said the area was dicey because of the proximity to the train station. Not true - it was just fine. The proximity to the train station and bus station (a few minutes walk) was great as it made traveling around the area so easy. Even better was the central location as we walked to almost every site in town. We felt we were so close to everything yet away from the main fray of the Duomo. The outstanding Trattoria Croce al Trebbio restaurant was literally around the corner. The very helpful people working the desk made reservations there for us and also recommended some other wonderful restaurants for us. They were so helpful. The breakfast was very good, if repetitive, and the cappuccino was perfect. We would love to return to Florence some day and would be sure to stay in this warm, friendly and charming hotel.

<Content>Great Location - But nothing to rave about I bypassed a number of hotels suggested by my travel agent based on the reviews posted by tripadvisor members. I selected the Santa Maria Novella Hotel because of all of the rave reviews about the location, level of service and overall quality of the hotel rooms. While the location was superb, this hotel definately wasn't worth raving about.My earlier travels to Europe had set my expectations of the hotel. In general European hotels tend to be one star behind, in additon to being smaller and more minimalist in room aminities in comparison to American hotels. Santa Maria Novella was no exception. Overall the hotel itself was decent except for the persistent smell of rotting trash we encountered every day on our hotel floor. The room size was typical as was the comfort level of the beds. The marbel adorning the bathroom was rather nice, but nothing spectacular. The breakfast was fine, offering both Italian as well as American options to choose from. These were the highlights. Here are the lowlights:We arrived to a cold reception from a dark-haired, olive-skinned gentleman working behind the desk (I specify only because, I never got his name and he was the only dark-haired man working behind the desk during our stay). He was perhaps the unfriendliest of them all. When we arrived to check in, we inquired about area tours. Our trip to Italy would only be four days and we wanted to maximize our stay. He pulled out a tour booklet for CAF tours and a map of Florence, slapped them on the desk in front of us and sent us on our way. No offer to advise us on the best tours, or any additional information. We ended up using the map to find the tour company office and walking over there to book for ourselves.A day or two later, we encoutered him again, and asked about our options for booking transportation and a tour for a day trip to Rome. He pointed arbitrarily across the square and said go over there, under the arches and someone there can help you book something. I'm sure we weren't the first guests to ask about tour options to other cities, so I find it hard to believe that he didn't have any additional information. Later that day one of his colleagues, a woman, provided a little more info, but still wasn't very helpful. She provided a more approximate location of over there, under the arches and the name of the place. After asking some other American tourists visiting the area (who had received more info and assistance from their respective hotels) we were able to piece together a great day trip for ourselves. We hopped on the Eurostar train to Rome and kind of played it by ear. Despite the obstacles, we still managed to have a fantastic trip. Was this hotel horrible? No. Would I rave about it? No. It was centrally located and generally clean. However, nothing at all to rave about. Although, I can't forget about the exceptionally friendly Giorgio, a bellboy who did best he could to help us when the front desk staff wouldn't.

<Content>What a great surprise! Our trip plans changed and suddenly they included Florence. We had 3 hours to find a place. We did not know what to expect. What a great place and very helpful staff. Our family of five wanted to spend the rest of our vacation at Santa Maria Novella Hotel! We plan on going back again and again.JeanSeattle,Wa

<Content>Lovely Hotel This is my second stay in this hotel, and it just keeps getting better. I booked a Stay 4 pay for 3 night holiday through a US travel agency, so I could pay in dollars, and ended up paying less than $200 per night, including breakfast. The service was impeccable, our original room did not have a bathtub, so we were switched to a larger room w/ a huge bath, without any additional charge. The bathrooms are decadently luxurious, and a hot soak after a long day is wonderful. The breakfast buffet has been expanded and includes fresh ripe fruit, an assortment of varied breads, as well as the eggs, meats, cheese and yoghurts. Something for everyone's tastes.The hotel helped book an excellant bus trip to Sienna and San Gimignano for 53 euros that left conveniently a short distance away (CAF tours) We were able to pay at the hotel and the vouchers were delivered to our room. So convenient. And Buca Mario, a fabulous restaraunt, is a block away!This is truly a great hotel in a prime location.

<Content>Greatest Staff on Earth In our many travels we have never experienced staff like those at the Santa Maria Novella. They provided a level of service far above any we have previously encountered. They were friendly, helpful and extremely accommodating. Nothing was too much trouble, even a laite at 5:30 in the morning, and that was from the desk clerk! A wonderful place to stay and it enhanced our visit to Florence - thank you Eleanor Spain and Larry Webster

<Content>A "Charming Gem" Everything about this hotel was great! We arrived at the train station at 2 in the morning from Rome. We walked a few hundred yards to the hotel from the train station. As we walked in we were greated by name by a friendly staff person who was obviously anticipating our arrival.............. The room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom was cozy and spacious. We loved the bathroom shower head which had great water pressure. :-). All the shopping and restaurants were within walking distance. There is some construction going on at the church square but we did not find it to be a bother. Overall a great experience and would definately stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, great location First stop on our honeymoon. Only 5 minutes from train station. Friendly, helpful staff. Hotel feels like a bit of a maze the first time but easy to get used to and adds to the charm. The renovation work in the square outside was slightly noisy, but only in the day. Much quieter than the central hotels, but only 10 minutes walk to the Ponte Vecchio, Great buffet breakfast. We had a deluxe room (top floor) with huge bathroom. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay

<Content>Wonderful, elegant, classic hotel. The Santa Maria Novella hotel in Florence is wonderful. The location is perfect, near the train station, on the square of the same name. The rooms are very big and impeccable. Very tastefully decorated. In spite of being on the square, our room was very quiet. Breakfast is unbelievable. If you cannot find something to your liking that is your problem. They had all sorts of pastries, cold cuts, cereals, pastries, eggs, bacon, yoghurts. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is within walking distance of the Duomo, Ponte de Vecchio, Academia and all other sights of interest in Florence. We liked that it was near the bus station which is next to the train station. We took the bus to Fiesole. We recommend that expedition. Very interesting town with Etruscan and Roman ruins and a great view of Florence. We recommend this hotel with no hesitation.

<Content>Pleasant Suprise If you are traveling by train, this is a great location. Only a 5 minute walk from the station. We were a little concerned about the construction. There was not much noise when we were in the hotel, even when we had the windows opened.The room was large and lovely. Very clean. We especially liked the bathroom, with a large marble tub. The bed was very comfortable and plenty of pillows, which is sometimes a problem for those needing more than one. Breakfast was nice with a good variety of cold and hot foods. The staff was professional and friendly. We were only at this hotel for two nights, but we enjoyed our experience. Would stay again, especially if we were traveling by train again.

<Content>Mixed Opinion Having stayed in this hotel in 2006 with great enjoyment I was looking forward to returning. The hotel is wonderfully appointed (new style European) with very comfortable bedding, well-lit bathrooms, powerful showers and washcloths which few European hotels provide, ample closet space, and breakfast included in the room price. The location is convenient to the center of Florence and within walking distance of everywhere you might like to visit (and the train station which is convenient ... no long wait in the taxi line to go less than 1/4 mile).My disappointment sits with the front desk who are not very visible and only helpful when you ask a question. Additionally, knowing I stayed in the hotel previously (this was my second and third visit), I was provided what had to be the smallest of rooms right next to an active construction site. There was no concern that this would be an inconvenience. When I insisted on being shown another room, I was met, initially, with uncooperative disbelief. I continued to politely insist and was provided another alternative.Had the front desk approached this with greater compassion, I would provide the Hotel SMN with a more favorable review. I end with 'buyer beware' (especially if you are travelling solo and are female). But do try the hotel as all other aspects remain ideal.

<Content>Florence Hotel This hotel overall was excellent. The location is great. It is across the street from the train station and within walking distance from all of the main attractions (5 minutes to almost anything). The hotel itself is very charming. The rooms are really nice and are a decent size by European standards and are very quite. The front desk staff was very helpful w/ directions  recommended sights. The only down side to this hotel is that Santa Maria Novella church is under construction which impacted the view.

<Content>Beautiful accomodations I stayed in the Hotel Santa Maria Novella for only one night, and wished I could have stayed there for the entirety of my three days in Florence due to the simply gorgeous accomodations. The room I stayed in (the cheapest rate available, so I am assuming it was the simplest abode they offer) had beautiful hardwood floors, bed linens (with a comfortable mattress -- a difficult find in Italy), drapes and a fantastic marble bathroom. It was much nicer than I was expecting, especially for the price. The location is not the most central, but still a 10-minute walk to most of the sights and very close to the train station, and away from the noise and bustle of busier locations. It is very close to upscale shopping and lots of trattorias. It was a very nice oasis after hectic sightseeing in Florence, and I would highly recommed this hotel, even over other hotels that are higher ranked on this website.

<Content>Loved,Loved, Loved The Santa Maria Novella My husband and I spent seven days at this hotel and I can not say enough good things about it. It was centrally located for shopping, sightseeing, train and bus stations. But more than that, everything pleased us. The staff at the front desk was wonderful, the attendants at breakfast were attentive - and speaking of breakfast - it was not the typical European breakfast - it had everything and was wonderful. We had a junior suite - the rooms were elegantly decorated and spacious, plenty of closet space, large bathroom with great shower and everything you could ask for from slippers, robes, emery boards, qtips, and a comfy bed and pillows. We spent one night in Venice at a well-known 5 star hotel - paid 3 times the amount for one night - and did not get the attention to detail and comfort that we received at the Santa Maria Novella. We would both recommend this quaint, Italian flavored hotel to anyone visiting Florence. A little hard to find but very well worth it once you are there.

<Content>Fabulous Value We base our decisions to a large degree on reviews from Trip Advisor. Because this was a hotel in the city we had modest expectations. We were blown away by the size, views and quality of the room (601) , service, and breakfast. We wouldn't consider another hotel after our experience.P.S.

A short walk (via the station underground passage and then across Piazza SMN) no cab is necessary. The hotel is small and offers warm and helpful service. The rooms are on the small side but beautifully decorated and quiet.Nice buffet breakfast. All of the main sights are a short stroll away/ We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Excellent Overall With Caveat A great hotel in a terrific location. Close walk to Florence's top attractions without being in the thick of things, many rooms have great views (although the church and square seem perennially under construction), nice breakfast, efficient service. However, note of caution: the hotel is comprised of two contiguous buildings, and walking from one to other feels like you're walking into another hotel entirely (not to mention the maze of elevators you sometimes need to take to find your room in the second building). Beautiful fabric covered walls give way to sloppily painted ones, carpeted floors to tiled ones, and the feel is altogether different and lower quality. Rooms don't seem quite as nice, either (based on earlier stays in the main building). Be sure to ask for a room in the main building. Would stay again (with above caveat).

<Content>The best 4-star hotel!! Florence was our first stop and having stayed at other 5 and 4 star hotels in Venice and Rome, this hotel was the best of the lot. Great location to train station - although there was a fair bit of construction work in the square so the hotel exterior surrounding is not great - but once you step inside, it's wonderful. Also the construction noise stop about 5pm. VERY spacious bed/ bath rooms. Hastea/coffee making facilities. Good buffet breakfast selections. Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Find My wife and I just spent seven days in Florence staying at the SMN Hotel. We really enjoyed the central location and short walk to the train station. The hotel itself was wonderful with good size rooms and friendly staff. Breakfast was quite nice, served in beautifully decorated dining rooms. Unfortunately, the building beside the hotel and the plaza across the street were under construction so the view wasn't much to see. The rooms were quiet in spite of the noise from the all the constructionhowever. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visting Florence.

We overheard a very load and objectionable American complaining all the time. Needless too.He just like the sound of his voice and clearly thought that the almighty dollar cut a dash here. It didn't - he and his fellow travllers were made to look stupid.The staff remained professional at all times and were very very helpful.A delightful trip and stay.

<Content>Great Value and Location Stayed last week at SMN Hotel for 3 nights. Wonderful hotel with good sized room and splendid bathroom! Staff very helpful at booking tours. Hotel is three minute walk from train station so if you are arriving by train don't take a taxi, just walk. All major tourist sites are within a 10 minute distance. Breakfast room is lovely with great selection of tasty foods. Had third floor corner room with views north and west. Unfortunately due to circumstances beyond the control of hotel there is extensive construction work on the piazza which is partially fenced off, and church is covered in tarps, and work appears to be long term. If you are going for the view, there is none to speak of due to the renovations of the piazza and church, but nonetheless the sunshine that streams into the rooms makes it worth having a room with a view of the piazza. Would stay at hotel again with or without the nearby piazza/church renovations as I consider the location, staffing and overall value all benefits. Recommend dinners at Acqua al 2, and Garga, and Cantinetta Antinori.

<Content>Good but with construction The things I particularly liked about this hotel were its location, comfortable room and large bright bathroom.The I was not crazy about was not related to the hotel, but there was construction in the piazza and it was not so picturesque.The location for me was perfect for a short weekend break, easy to get to from the airport by bus, and still within walking distance -less than 10 minutes- of the major sites.The room gave the impression of an apartment rather than just a hotel room as upon entering you come upon a small hallway which separates the great bed in the bedroom and the bathroom. The bathroom was white marble and very spacious, always felt clean and the rain shower was wonderful. Because the bathroom was so large, I think they could have used the space to put in a jacuzzi...though, I do not know if all the rooms are set-up this way.As for the construction, the piazza was a bit in disarray and the church was also under renovation, so it was not the prettiest of places during my visit. As for noise, I was so comfortably asleep I never was woken by any sound. Reception said they were told by the city 6 months, but the staff were skeptical and figured on a year.When I visit Florence again, I will be booking this hotel.

<Content>Really enjoyable I stayed at this hotel with a group of families and students and really enjoyed myself. I was unsure of what to expect, but was really pleased with my experience. The staff was warm and helpful, and the room (a quad) was one of the most spacious rooms I have stayed in in Europe. The ceilings were high, with comfortable beds, and nice wooden floors. It was one of the few times that I did not feel cramped with three other people in the room. I liked the location of the hotel, and took advantage of the internet and the breakfast. I would stay here again for the value.

<Content>Fabulous Florence Stopover We visited Fabulous Florence only briefly (2 days). Staying over at Hotel Santa Maria Novella was an experience so joyful that we are already determined to return for our next vacation. Hotel Santa Maria Novella impressed us not only for the lavish accomodations but for the convenience; a short block from the train station. We merely walked a short block to the front entrance. Service was excellent! Marco treated us like family. Our beautiful 4th floor room was recently renovated very spacious, with a luxurious marble bath. Nothing could be more beautiful. We also enjoyed cocktails served us in Santa Maria Novella's cozy bar. A stunning mirrored breakfast room each morning serves up the hearty breakfast included in the fare.

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful We booked the Santa Maria Novella based on the Trip Advisor reviews and we were 100% pleased. At first upon arrival, they did put us in a room on the 1st floor with just a shower. I was a little upset because I had made the reservations far in advance and paid for a room with a view of the plaza. The first room did face the plaza but it looked right over the parking lot also, as it was so close to the ground. I went to the front desk and they immediately moved us to the 4th floor with a much better view and full bath. It was awesome! We can't thank the staff enough for all their help. Never once did we find any of the staff without a smile and always willing to help. The place is immaculate also. They even come in and turn your sheets down for the evening. Two recommendations: Buco Mario's restaurant which is a very short walk from the hotel is excellent. We ate there 2 of the 3 nights we stayed in Florence. We took a private tour with Chaauffeur Italy Service. There were 4 of us and the tour was 9 hours at only $89 euros pp. The email address is [--]. And the website is [--]. The hotel gave us this information. Francesco was our driver and it was so wonderful. We went on private wine tours through the Tuscany area and visited several small villages and castles. It was well worth the $$! We will definately stay at the Santa Maria Novella next time we visit Florence.

<Content>Not impressed I visited Santa Maria Novella Hotel with my husband last week (May 2007) for 6 nights. We have travelled around the world and stayed in a lot of 4 and 5 star hotels. With this one we were not impressed. The whole hotel must have been recently renovated. The interior decoration was ok. There was a construction site just next to the hotel and throughout the day the noise was terrible!!!! We woke up early in the morning just from the noise!!! Also, the windows of our room looked right at the construction building so we couldn't open them because of the noise and dust... We believe, that they should not charge the same price as usual their rooms as long as the construction is on, because it is very annoying.... The breakfast was not anything special neither. Nevertheless, there were nice things about this hotel as well. First of all, the hotel staff was very nice, and very helpful. Our room was cleance 2 times a day, which is not used in all expensive hotels. The hotel is situated in a very strategic point in Santa Maria Novella piazza, very close to the central train station, all public transport and the whole historic centre of the town.

<Content>Very Happy Upon arrival I wasn't sure what to expect from the Santa Maria Novella Hotel, but I left an enthusiastic fan. It's in a great location for taking day train trips from Florence's train station just down a long block. It's also a short walk into the heart of town and the Duomo. The staff was friendly, very helpful, and spoke good English. The room was beautiful and had a great view of the Santa Maria church (if only it weren't partially covered for renovations). The bed was quite comfortable even though it was actually two tight fitting mattresses (quite common in Italy). The room and bathroom were immaculate. A nice breakfast is provided which includes a good selection of fruits, pastries, cereals, yogurt and juices. Their eggs and bacon are ugly but quite delicious. Earlier, I stayed at a much pricier hotel in Florence and wish I had booked here instead. It's also right around the corner from a few of our favorite restaurants: Garga and Buca Lappi. Some reviews discussed the construction next door. We stayed on a weekend so we did not experience any of that. We will gladly return.

<Content>Great hotel, great location but.... Loved this hotel, location great just of Piazza Santa Maria Novella, 1 minute walk from train/bus station. Less than 10 minutes walk to centre. Breakfast was buffet style and had a very good selection.The only negative was the renovations of the building that is joined onto the hotel, which may well be part of the hotel. The noise started at 6.30am and there was no going back to sleep after that. Our room was located on the side of the renovations.However I would definately stay at this hotel again but would advise to check with reception at check in that you are not on the side of the renovations while they are ongoing.

<Content>Perfect in Every Way My husband and I stayed at the Santa Maria Novella for 4 days in February 2007 and enjoyed every minute of it. At first we were a bit concerned about the hotel's proximity to the train station, but the minute we entered the hotel's lobby our concerns disapated. Everything about the hotel was perfect. Our room was large and beautifully appointed, the lobby is serene and welcoming, breakfast in the lovely mirrored breakfast room was excellent, and the service was impeccable. Everyone on the staff(especially Leonardo!), was exceptionally friendly and helpful. This is a wonderful, elegant, small, well located hotel, without being pretenious or stuffy. We can't wait to return!

<Content>A Little Gem I stayed at the Santa Maria on buisness in April 2006. What alittle gem. The room I shared with two friends was large overlooking the square. The decor was typically Italian and the bed was to die for. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. We only had breakfast which was limited but good. If I was going back to Florence I would certainly go back to this Hotel. Great value for money and a great location.....

<Content>Great stay at the Santa Maria We stayed at the Santa Maria Novella for one night of our honeymoon as we were passing through from the country in Tuscany to Rome. It was wonderful. The rooms are beautifully decorated. The breakfast which is included is excellent! The staff is very courteous and helpful. They recommended a great restaurant called the Pizzeria Dante which is way more than a pizzeria. Very quaint, economical, and delicious. We wished we could have stayed longer. The only down side, which is out of the hotels control is that there was construction in the piazza outside the hotel so the view wasn't as good as it could have been. Otherwise once that is complete it will be perfect.

<Content>Lovely and convenient hotel! My huband and I spent 2 nights here during our honeymoon in Italy. I was a little hesitate after reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor, such as the rude staff. Overall, we had no problems while staying here. The location is within walking distance of the train, so do not pay for a cab to take you to the hotel unless you have major luggage! The hotel itself is very nice, our room was a good size with a comfortable bed and large bathroom. The hotel also offers an extensive breakfast, the best one we had during our stay in Italy. The hotel is within easy walking distance to everything, and is in a quieter part of the city so you do not have to deal with noise. There was construction on the building next door to the hotel, and even that did not bother us. A great stay!

<Content>Lovely small hotel My husband and I recently stayed at the Santa Maria Novella Hotel at the beginning and end of our trip to Italy for a total of four nights. I booked because the majority of reviews on Trip Advisor were good, but had a few reservations ...a few comments on rude staff and too near the train station for my own personal taste. ( I normally depend on Karen Brown Travels as a guide and this hotel is not listed in her book). The SMN met all our expectations. It was clean, great access, friendly staff, nicely furnished, great bathrooms. The price was very reasonable for the level of accomodation in Florence. It was very quiet, great linens, and there was no problem at all walking around at night. I would highly recommend and would return without a second thought. I had read that the man with the mustache was rude...I did not have that experience at all. I think he is just a bit reserved and was very accomodating. Also interesting to note that the JFK Hotel (highly rated) is just a few doors away (and and extra $100 or so euros a night).

<Content>Spectacular hotel experience We stayed at the hotel SMN for 5 nights during our wedding in Florence. Along with our guests, we had booked approximately 15+ rooms in the hotel. Overall, suffice to say that we were immensely pleased with the quality of the hotel (furnishings, location, etc) and the experience of our stay (service, friendliness, etc).The penthouse suite with the rooftop patio is simply breathtaking and highly recommended. Alternatively, all other rooms are also very charming and comfortable.I rarely (ie: never) write reviews like this but relied extensively on this site to select the hotel and hope this review serves to help as well.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised Following other reviews from trip advisor we booked this hotel because of proximity to rail station (our biking trip left from SMN station). Against the advice of our travel agent we booked anyway and were very pleasantly surprised. Very walkable distance to the heart of Florence-10 to 15 min. Our room was very nice, bathrooms very well appointed. Nice thread count sheets and linen towels. Staff was very accomodating. Loved the Napoleon room and the bar tender shared with us some of his special stash of his favorite local wines. I am so glad we found this little oasis without having to drag luggage farther into town. Would stay again.

<Content>Great Hotel!!! This was by far the best hotel on our trip. The front desk people were so helpful and nice. The rooms were big and they give you your own pair of slippers to wear and keep. They also have free Internet access in the basement. It is right next to the train station and within walking distance of almost every site. It is a little hard to find because they do not have a big sign out front. There is only a little plaque on the ground.

<Content>Wonderful experience Four of us stayed here for three nights in mid-September. It was a perfect oasis from the heat and tourist grind. The rooms were spotless and the bathrooms huge with wonderful rainforest type shower heads. Everyone we dealt with was exceedingly helpful and cheery so I don't know why the woman from New York had such problems. True, our rooms had no view but I didn't come to Tuscany to look out the hotel room window. The breakfast was the best one I've had in Italy. We will always come back here to stay.James BurkeDenver, Coloradojb6785@hotmail.com

<Content>good value hotel choice for limited budget We chose Hotel Santa Maria Novella based on other Tripadvisor reviews. We found the hotel to be a good choice, considering our limited budget. The hotel interiors were spotlessly clean and attractive - with a genuine feeling of history and Florence. Everything was fresh and there were zero signs of shabbiness. The rooms were very nice - Very comfortable beds with a zillion threadcount sheets. Bathrooms were very luxurious. Breakfast (included in the rate) was excellent. The only negatives were the non-exist views from the bedrooms - looking directly into construction sites. But this is temporary, and the windows were sound-proofed so there was no noise. The other negative was their concierge service - they dropped the ball several times.

The bathroom was marble and very nicely accomodated. The staff were very nice and helpful. They recommended good local restaurants and bars. Our room was always perfect when we returned. Slippers put out, linens put out. Worth every penny. My husband and I truly wish we could have stayed here longer.

<Content>Can't say enough BAD things about it I booked this hotel about 2 months ago for a one night stay while in Florence. I'm not usually one to write a review, and I usually don't complain about little nit-picky things, but this place was awful. My problems started more or less from the moment I walked into this place. The woman at the front desk had awful manners, very snooty, and unnecessary. I travel internationally frequently for work, and I usually don't bother with cultural differences in manners. It's usually not worth getting upset over, but this was something else. It got worse from there. The room I booked was a standard room. Being a resident of NYC I always book a room with the nicest view, most light, and airiest I can find. It's something I cafn't normally get in the city. I don't expect everything I want, every time...that's not how life works, but this room was ridiculous. The window faced a wall that was maybe 5 feet away, and was so small it may as well not even been there. When I requested a room change, I was told that there were none available, and anyway this was the standard room. When I pointed out that this is not remotly what was is advertised I was *screamed* at and told this was the standard room. After a few minutes of this I gave up, but you may want to take this under consideration when booking here. Aside from that the furnishings were outstanding. Some of the best that I've seen in a 4 star. For me these things aren't important. This place didn't even measure up to a holiday inn. It's not all about the show they put on. The whole thing may as well have been made of straw.

<Content>Would go back, lovely hotel We spent three night in this hotel as part of our honeymoon, the location was excellent for us as we arrived in florence by train. The hotel is a few hundred yards from SMN station via an underpass straight out of the station concourse and about another 100 yards from the underpasses exit right in the middle of piazza Santa Maria Novella.The room was beautiful, clean and spacious, the rest of the hotel matches these standards, breakfast is a buffet with a very good choice and fresh foods that would cater for all tastes.The staff were friendly and helpful and gave us a lot of information about Florence when we checked in, including a good street map of the area. Not that you really need it, the main sites are about 15 minutes stroll away and the church of Santa Maria Novella right outside the door.In summary Florence is a wonderful city and this is a wonderful hotel well deserving of its 4 star rating. We thought it was excellent value as well.

<Content>Happy to Stay again We stayed in this hotel for one night last week, it was a last minute decision as we hoped to stay the night in Siena but found all the hotels full so had a quick search on this site and booked the Santa Maria and crossed our fingers !We were not disappointed and the hotel delivered everything we were looking for a stay in Florence. We stay in 4* hotels every week with work so we are pretty experience and hotels have to be better than average to impress us.This is what we thought - yes the hotel is not well signed but actually makes it feel a little more boutique and exclusive, the decor follows this theme and is a refreshing change to the bland multi national hotel feel you often get, it adds to the Florence atmosphere. Our room was fine, maybe a little small but how much time do you spend in the room anyhow ? It was clean, had a lovely bed and felt pretty lush ! The breakfast was also fine with plenty of choice. On the down side i would say the square isn't the most pretty in Florence but your not paying for it either. Yes there is some biulding going on close to the hotel at the moment but as we were there in August i suspect they were not working and we heard nothing and most importantly heard nothing from other quests. The receptionist was very helpful with all our questions - shame about some of the guests that were so rude to her !Overall i would day this is a lovely hotel, in a very central location, we were very happy bearing in mind we took pot luck !!!

<Content>loved the room!! We stayed at the Santa Maria from 6 to 8 Aug and it was fabulous! We got a special rate from their website  paid about Euro400+ for 3 nights. The room was large by European standards including the beautiful marble bathroom. Bed was also comfortable and the pillows as well, since we really needed the good nights sleep for all the sight-seeing we were going to do. We had room 307 which faced the square, no problems with noise whatsover, if we didnt have the alarm on we would have overslept given the comfortable bed. Pity about room 601, if we had known, we would have asked for the upgrade too!Breakfast was good as well, served in their large and delightful dining room. Just a great experience, especially since we were there on our honeymoon! The only grouse we had was with 1 of the hotel receptionist, the chap with the moustache... but fortunately the rest of the hotel staff more than made up for his bad attitude!

<Content>Noisy, noisy, noisy If you want a eye-candy and don't care about anything else, this may be a good choice. We stayed 2 nights in August at Santa Maria Novella. While first impression of the hotel was great, we soon found how noisy the hotel is. cons:- construction in the adjacent building, and we were waken up by LOUD pounding sound around 7am- bad sound proof of the rooms: when our neighbor open/shut their door, it sounded like our door was openned/shut. Street noise can be clearly heard with all windows shut.- rude front desk receptionist - it's a shame how hard to find the hotel given how close it's to the train station. The only sign that says Santa Maria Novella is a plaque the size of a text book hung by the door - kind of hard to spotI found at least a dozen other reasonable hotels closeby... we will not stay in Santa Maria Novella again.

<Content>Very special hotel Florence was part of our honeymoon and we stayed at Santa Maria Novella Hotel for three nights. I booked the hotel through its internet site and we got a special offer. I booked a standard room but they promised me an upgarde with an extra cost in case of availability.When we actually got there I asked them whether they could do an upgrate and they told us that since it was our honeymoon they arranged the best possible upgrade. Guess what! the gave us room 601!!!Amazing room with private terrace and a fantastic view of Duomo.The breakfast was very good, the location was very convenient and the staff was very friendly. We didn't ask any particular reccommendation though because I already knew where we wanted to go!I will definately stay again there!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel Santa Maria Novella - An experience not to be missed We planned on getting married in Florence so just over a year ago we set off for a couple of days in search of a hotel to hold our wedding reception. We had a list of of hotels to visit that we liked the look of.Two days into our trip and a little disheartened as nothing had impressed us much, we paid a visit to the Hotel Santa Maria Novella... upon seeing the discreet sign outside and entering the hotel we were instantly impressed.The hotel is situated in a lovely square away from the hustle and bustle of the main roads yet it is not even a 5 minute walk from the train station and there is an instant feeling of peace and tranquility when you enter the doors of the beautiful building.We met with the manager Mr. Claudio Delli who gave us unlimited time and attention to discuss our ideas and wishes for the wedding. Mr. Delli showed us around the hotel and it was a delight to see the tasteful decor and the attention to detail around the hotel... the rooms are beautifully furnished and luxurious!By the time we reached the top floor and Room 601 which has an amazing terrace with breath taking views of the Duomo and Florence... we knew we had found a special hotel!We left that day feeling so happy that we had found the perfect hotel and knowing that our big day was in good hands. So, for the following 12 months e mails passed between Claudio, his staff and ourselves arranging all the details. I have heard so many people say how stressful arranging a wedding is...even though we were in different countries, Claudio made it all so simple and relaxed that it was a joy!When the time finally came to return to Florence to get married we could not wait and were fully relaxed knowing that everything would be perfect.All the staff at the hotel were so friendly, nothing was too much effort and everything was done with a smile, as a result our big day did not disappoint... we ate delicious food out on the terrace of room 601 which the hotel had decorated beautifully for us and the views only added to the magic!We could not have picked a better hotel for our wedding for many reasons... it has a great central location, the service is the best we have ever got , the staff on every level and management are so friendly and accomodating and of course the building and decor are both tasteful and luxurious... everything you could want from a hotel! Our experience in The Hotel Santa Maria Hotel was a special and memorable one and we hope to return and stay there many times in the future and are already planning our return visit for our 1st anniversary!Niamh  Ronan O'HaraDublin.

<Content>Amazing..... We stayed in the Santa Maria Novella for 3 nights as we were attending our best friends wedding in the hotel. I have to say every aspect of this hotel blew me away. Our room, although facing building work was amazing. A real treat for my boyfriend and I. The room was large and impressive, the bathroom was out of this world. It was huge, all marble with a big deep bath and the shower was fab. It was perfect right down to the heated towel rails. Our best friends got married in Florence. The wedding reception was fantastic, we were up on the terrace at 601 for the meal and speeches with a breath taking view of the domo and florence. We then retired down to the bar for the evening. The morning of the wedding the room service to the brides room for her and all the brides maids was outstanding. The food for the wedding was delious and the wines chosen by the bride and groom with some help from the hotel were lovely.All in all I would highly recommed this hotel, I had an amazing stay there and would go back again. From the moment you walk thro the door's your breath will be taken away by the beauty of the reception that carries thro the hotel. The staff are friendly and the whole experience was a pleasure.If you can get room 601.. Word dont decribe the views...

<Content>A great hotel! This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful service, and it is within walking distance of most attractions (we timed our selves strolling to the Duomo and it took about 6 minutes). I know that many times the star ratings on travel websites do not have any basis in realiity, however, this time I completely agree with the rating on Expedia.com that it is four star hotel. The rooms were great, the breakfasts were very nice, and I loved that the shower products are from the famed nuns at the Perfumia Santa Maria Novella. We stayed in Florence for a week and had a wonderful time. If you would like to know anything else about this hotel, or places to eat in Florence, please feel free to email me at foodiedb@optonline.net.

<Content>A real treasure I booked this hotel for the period 7/11/06-7/16/06. My basis was the high recommendation on this website, and the attractive rates on the hotel's website -- 160 euros is pretty decent for a 4-star in July. I paid the 20-euro upgrade fee, and our room was on the 3rd floor (305), facing the square.We were very happy in all regards. The room was bright, clean and decently large. The air-conditioning had no trouble at all with the very hot weather (I've found some Italian air conditioners to be more hope  noise than cooling muscle). The bathroom is sparkling -- I never did quite figure out how to close the shower door without wetting the floor, though. The breakfast is fine, perhaps not special; I would have preferred better and more rolls -- but this is getting to the level of silly pickiness, since the less you eat at breakfast the more room you have for fantastic Florence food.I was initially concerned about the location -- on the square near the train station. In fact, the square is a nice place to be at night, very friendly and active. (The train station 100 m away, is another story; but it has no impact on this lovely hotel.) I had read some reviews suggesting that noise was a problem: no way, no noise at all, at least not in our room.I particularly liked the folks who worked behind the desk at this hotel, and a special thanks to the pretty young lady who worked on the night of July 15. She noticed that we were checking out the next day, and asked if we were going to the airport. Yes indeed; but we would not have been going far without her help, since there was a wildcat taxi strike on that we had not heard about. This helpful lady arranged for a ride for us to the airport. Thanks!! By the way, she not only was kind to my awful Italian, she spoke perfect English, and her French sounded good, too.Can I recommend a couple of great downtown restaurants? The Cantinetta Antinori offers classic Tuscan food, excellent quality and fine wines of which they are particularly proud. And Alle Murate has moved to a beautiful new (actually, really old!) location in a converted palazzo. Alle Murate is a little pricy (we each paid 80 euros for a prix-fixe), but you definitely get what you pay for -- please give these a try!

<Content>Extermely poor service, all you get is a fairly modern room Agreed with the previous review. The building / room itself is fine as its a fairly modern building. Location is convenient (close to station but its not at an attractive part of the city). The Piazza itself has nothing to be admired about, in fact one of the worst piazza I am seen in Florence so probably not worth paying for room with piazza view. Its full of piegeons, youths, construction workers, litter and rubbish bins. There is a massive constrution site facing the other side of the hotel (about 2 m away) so be aware that it can be very dark and no view at all as the site is all boarded up.I emailed the hotel confirming my booking a week in advance and was told everything is fine. However, when I got to the hotel (after 2 hours from the airport which is 20 mins away due to a taxi strike), I was told that there is a computer problem in the morning and no room is available, which is highly suspecious. We were then sent to a run down, very dated hotel (Roma Hotel) a few blocks down. Also no attempt was made by the hotel to inform us of the taxi strike (which was known in advance in Florence) which caused us a bit of problem/discomfort getting to the hotel at extermely hot weather.The worst part is the service. There is someone different everyday at the reception. 2 out of 3 receptionists do not speak proper English. When we asked for restaurant recommendation, everyday the reception would recommend one called Buca Mario, which is round the corner from the hotel. When we got there, there was a queue of tourists, all recommeneded by other hotels! The food itself is OK (nothing outstanding) but price is definitely above average for Florence standard.On the 2nd day we again asked for recommendation and was told to go to the same restaurant. We told them we have been the night before then he came up with another one which is closed on a Sunday which was no good. Apart from the 2 restaurants (one is closed), the hotel didnt know about ANY other restaurant in Florence which I find very hard to believe. To me it sounds like if they dont get a kickback then they cannot be bother.On the final day we asked for a late checkout as our flight is 5:30pm and given the mistake they have made on the first day and all the trouble caused. We requested a 3pm checkout and was told its not possible and best they could do is 2pm which was not of any use to us. In the end we had to check out before we were out at 9am. OVerall very disappointing hotel and do not stay there as all you get is a fairly modern / clean room and not much else.

<Content>Deluxe honeymoon heaven at bargain rates! My freshly minted husband and I made Firenze our first three-night stop after our Venice wedding and three nights at the San Clemente Palace (see separate review on this site.) I had booked through the hotel's own website. After unabashed luxury at the San Clemente, I apologetically stated to hubby that we'd be in a budget hotel...considering our 'bargain' rate of about 200 Euro/night. After a train trip that included a nightmarish change of trains (5 suitcases, folks) in Bologna, we finally arrived, sweaty and bedraggled to our 'budget hotel.' To our utter amazement, nothing could have been further from the truth. To wit:The Santa Maria Novella hotel is a bona fide JEWEL! Gorgeously decorated with antiques, heavy drapes, stunning colors, paintings, and very newly renovated, the hotel is hidden in a quiet corner of the piazza leading up to an equally stunning church, the Santa Maria Novella (not to be missed.)Check-in staff were solicitious, charming and ready to help. Our room was a standard double with no view whatsoever. In fact, there was construction going on, which meant that the wall facing our window was covered in dusty cloth. It really didn't matter to us, since we were going to be out of the room all day anyway. The furnishings were tasteful, newly upholstered and in soothing yellow and rust tones. The bed was comfortable and romantic. There were wood-beamed ceilings. There was a desk with cable for our laptop (something NOT available at the San Clemente, oddly enough). There was also a smaller flat-screen TV, a minibar and ample wardrobe space. The bathroom...aaah...I could sing praises to it even now! Beautiful inlaid marble, the rainshower was great, toiletries were good and there was ample space for everything. The only thing missing was 2 robes, but hey, who's wearing robes when honeymooning?Breakfast was nice, in fact, they had true wholegrain bread, which I'd been missing at the San Clemente. There were also eggs, yogurt, fruits, and the usual suspects for Continental breakfast. We also ordered room service upon arrival, which was prompt and quite freshly prepared. Despite the construction, we never heard a peep. The hotel was extraordinarily quiet. Staff in the reception were very helpful in confirming our restaurant bookings. Restaurants of note included Rossiini (tiny haute cuisine portions, but very good) and Don Chisciotte, an elegant Tuscan place at the northern end of the city. The hotel is very centrally located, near all the museums and palaces. We had organized a private tour guide for our days in Firenze, second time using her, and we do feel it's the best way to fully appreciate and understand the vast cultural repository of the Renaissance. All in all, we almost liked the four star Santa Maria Novella more than the five star plus San Clemente Palace. It was more romantic, more intimate, and yes, I preferred the Florentine bathroom. Next time we come to Firenze we will stay here again...although with so many positive reviews, I'm sure their occupancy rate will be at 100%.

<Content>It's the little things that make the count We booked the Santa Maria Novella Hotel based on TripAdvisor recommendations. On the surface the hotel is beautifully furnished situated in a very central and good location in Florence within walking distance of major sights. The rooms are gloriously decorated with a full marble bathroom and you really feel you are in a luxurious place. The bedroom is very cozy and comfortable. But for us the hotel did not meet our expectations of a four-star hotel. Everything was attended to on the surface, the bathroom looked very clean but when we returned at the end of the day, the floor was not cleaned. The beds were turned down at night yet the bathroom left still messy. The breakfast was sumptuously laid out in a beautful setting however one day the milk was bad and we did not eat breakfast there again after that. Whenever we asked the staff questions the information changed or was not consistent the next time, and the receptionist staff were not very friendly, as least we did not feel warm and fuzzy. As mentioned the hotel itself is beautiful and most folks could enjoy their stay there, but it just did not meet our personal expectations based on the level of four star hotels we have stayed in across the globe. Finally, everything is branded Santa Maria hotel, the bath mat, the bath towels, soap, shampoo, toiletries, glass covers, bed mats, bed spread, slippers, bath robe even down to the intimate cleanser. It was a bit over the top.

<Content>Above average My wife and I stayed at the SMN Florence for two nights 28-29th June 2006 during the second leg of a two week tour of Tuscany and Venice, arriving by train from Pisa early afternoon. The hotel is situated about 5-10 minutes walk from Santa Maria Novella station, in the Piazza of the same name. I was dissapointed upon arriving at the Piazza Santa Maria Novella to note that the Church of the same name was undergoing some sort of restoration to the facia and as such was completely hidden behind scaffolding. I also admit to geting a little worried when the hotel seemed a little elusive in as much as we walked around the whole Piazza before noticing that the entrance to the hotel was also concealed by a second mountain of scaffolding that had been erected to the adjacent building.Upon checking in both my wife and I found the staff friendly and attentive and the lobby, bar, breakfast room and reading rooms were all very nicely decorated and furnished.When we arrived at our room we were very pleased with the size as most hotels in Italy that I have stayed at, have rooms akin to the size of a broom cupboard. The bathroom was small but clean and in-keeping with the rooms decor which I can only describe as Italian lots of bold colours and draped fabrics. The television was a very small, possibly 15, lcd with only one English channel, namely CNN as with everywhere else we stayed in Italy.The location is very good as you are close to both the station, Duomo and Baptisery and only a short walk from the Ponte Vecchio and Ufrizi.Breakfast was nothing to write home about, standard European fare, a croissant, coffee and juice...an omellette if you were willing to pay 12 Euro PP to have it served in your room.I am always taken aback somewhat at the ratings given on Trip Advisor for hotels in Europe, I can only imagine that the large US contingent are less expectant of high quality/medium cost whilst travelling in Europe and as such are always pleasently suprised when arriving at what I would call, by worldwide standards, an above average but unspectacular hotel.Had I been travelling in the USA or Asia Pacific/Australia, I would give this hotel a mark of three, however, knowing as I do what you get for your Pound/Dollar/Euro in Europe I will mark this hotel four out of five, as I can't imagine that you are likely to find anywhere as good for the money. That is not to say however, that I was blown away.

<Content>perfection for our wedding we stayed here for a week prior to our wedding in florence. We stayed in the penthouse suite which is the only room on the top floor and has it's own elevator. The room is not huge but it is nice. The balcony/terrace for the room is a different story. It is two levels and twice as big as the room and we had a party up there after the reception was finished. The whole room overlooks the duomo and is amazing. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful and the breakfast was good. Most of our guests stayed here and at times we would be having cocktails in the evening in the lounge and no one seemed to mind the noise. The hotel is in a great location also. We walked everywhere. Two amazing restaurants: Restaurant Leo in Santa Croce and Il Latini. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Charming Hotel We stayed in the Santa Maria Novella on the first night of our little tour around Tuscany. We really loved it there. The hotel is very charming, from the people at the front desk to the decor to our lovely room. The location is quite near all there is to see and the breakfast in the morning was delicious. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, perfectly located This hotel is such a good fine, if, like I did, you get a cheap to Piza then a bus/train to Florence then this hotel is perfect. it's a 2 min walk from the train station and very easy to find. That's the beauty of Florence, you can just wander around enjoying the atmosphere and then you stumble upon your hotel again just when you need it.I recommend the place at Christmas time, absolutely stunning. Good breakfast in the hotel too! most important.Enjoy, I fully recommend it!

<Content>Most enjoyable stay We had a most enjoyable stay at this hotel, convenient location, wonderful room, perfectly soundproof (considering there is work renovations very close by), wonderful breakfast. We got this room for average 200 euros includ. bkfast; a little bit expensive for us but in the end we were very happy to have splurged here, having seen pictures of other hotels in similar category. And if u want something really special, i would advise u to splurge on the bellavista room, on the top floor with the whole very big balcony to yourself, with wonderful panoramic views of florence and sunlit rainshower bathroom. (i think about about 315 euros?)The only fault i could find to this hotel is that the staff, although courteous and very professional, are not all that friendly. With lots of smiles, this hotel would have been much more of an experience.Without hesitation, I would stay here again. But please note the hotel is renovating and adding more rooms (good noise insolation from outside but we did ask that the work be not started till at least 9am). If you are sensitive, u might ask for a room that is further away from work renvoation.PS If u love shopping brand names, ask about the tour to the Mall and Prada outlet, so worth it, especially for shoes.
