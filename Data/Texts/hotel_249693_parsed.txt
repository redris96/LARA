<Content>What a Find! I was looking for a place to stay close to UCLA as we were on a trip looking at colleges. UCLA actually recommended The Brentwood Inn, and after reading the reviews here, I booked directly through the property. I could not have been more pleased- a great location (10 minutes from UCLA and Malibu- yet in a very nice, quiet neighborhood), free parking, wonderful staff and cozy rooms that include continental breakfast and bottled water, soft drinks, and tea/coffee all day. The front desk staff printed out maps for all the many directions that we asked for, gave excellent restaurant suggestions, and genuinely seemed happy to help in any way. We have traveled all over the world, and while the big chain hotels serve a purpose, it is so nice to run across a small inn run by people who take great pride in their product. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Outstanding service  The BB is in a perfect location on Sunset Boulevard. It is 15min away from Santa Monica / Malibu / Beverly Hills and in a posh neighbourhood. I would recommend a room on the back (where we were) as the hotel is facing the busy boulevard. The room was quiet, very clean and had an extremely comfortable bed with soft bedlinens! The service at the front desk was really outstanding: they were helping you out for absolutely everything with an extreme kindness. I would go back again! Only thing they could do to improve themselves is to add a shelf for the cosmetics in the bathroom.

<Content>Our sanctuary in LA My wife and I used to live about a half mile away from the Brentwood Inn 3 years ago and now return to the Los Angeles area regularly (every few months) for business and to visit friends. We always prefer to stay at the Brentwood Inn whenever possible.The rooms are simple, comfortable and tastefully decorated, staff and owners always very accommodating, and the location is among our favorite in all of LA -- within walking distance to Brentwood Village and a short ride to Santa Monica.Note that the parking is tight (as it is in most of West LA), so a smaller rental car is advisable and if you are looking for a large Disney-fied resort for your noisy children to run wild, this is not the place for you.The Brentwood Inn is truly our home away from home, whenever we return to Los Angeles.

<Content>Ultra-comfortable night in a crazy city I stayed here with my family recently and it was wonderful. Small, intimate, quiet, very comfortable. Thought the rooms might be a little small, but the room I shared with my brother was ideal. Gracious, helpful staff that is never in-your-face, but always has many suggestions on how to see Los Angeles the way the locals do. Free parking, breakfast, and internet access too. A complete value. Forget all those places in Los Angeles where you are treated rudely and you sleep uncomfortably--stay here instead!

<Content>Better than any Hollywood Bungalow in LA!! The Brentwood Motor Inn has been a fixture in our family now for over 30 years, with plenty of family and friends staying there.Last year I had to return to LA and the staff of the Brentwood Motor Inn (COMPLETELY and incredibly tastefully redone inside and out!), and stayed at the Motor Inn for 2 days. It has been completely and tastefully redone and now the rooms inside look more like something you'd see in Conde Nast's Traveler magazine, or in a high end Hollywood Bungalow tucked away in the Hills and charging double or triple the price.The Brentwood Inn, IS a little pricey but you get what you pay for and MORE from the Brentwood Inn! They have a GREAT and constantly refilled breakfast buffet and due to my travel circumstances the staff was nice enough to let me check in at noon on a weekend AND I got BETTER than the AAA discounted rate! The staff are both solicitous and helpful for those who do not know LA's sprawling freeways and always willing to print out directions for you from their very nice office. The Wi-Fi service and BIG SCREEN TV's in each room are a welcome change from even the 32 TV's in upscale motel rooms. My room had a 42 LCD TV mounted above the wall which was wonderful to watch college football on while working on my laptop. The night before I checked in I stayed in a $120 a night place in Santa Monica. TOTAL NIGHTMARE. The Brentwood Inn is like a little idyllic spot where you can close the SOUND PROOFED DOORS and shut the world out for a little while. I got my ONLY good sleep in LA at the Brentwood Inn and I've stayed all over LA from the $120 a night place before to the $800 a night per room Mondrian (this was awhile ago :-), and I lived in LA for over 20 years. For the peace, the quiet, the wonderful service and the simple respite and the wonderful breakfast in the morning. They put out GOOD muffins and cereal, fresh fruit, etc. Not your cheapo standard motel buffet and everything is FRESH. My ONLY caveat might be if you have kids. Book TWO rooms adjacent to each other so the kids can have one if you want or save this place as your idyllic get away for two!Again the SAME family has run this property for over 30 years and it has been redone both tastefully and wonderfully with only the little bobble here and there. New paint, new beds, new EVERYTHING. STAY HERE before it gets booked up or found out about! They have EVERY service including fax you might need, reasonable, for LA, rates, and the Brentwood Inn is probably the MOST CONVENIENT place to stay IF you're going to be mostly in West LA. And it's the ONLY place to stay that's actually in Brentwood. The diff between staying at the Brentwood Inn, which used to be your run of the mill family owned motel, and now is something MUCH NICER and much more opulent and extravagant, is that at any chain or anyplace else on the Westside of LA you can get a decent room for around the same price (ALL of LA is expensive now I found out on my last 3 visits:-).The difference is staying at the Brentwood Motor Inn is an EXPERIENCE. One NOT to be missed. The room was NICER than my own bedroom at home and changed my mind about going out and buying an LCD TV as well!, the rooms are VERY, good sized, nice BIG bathroom with all NEW fixtures (outer molding on my bathroom window could have used some fresh white paint but it's outside after all) and the beds are firm and NEW and so are ALL the fixtures and it looks like they had a VERY GOOD interior deceorator design the theme for the rooms. Probably the NICEST most tastefully decorated rooms this side of the Mauna Kea imho.You get what you pay for and this is definitely worth it for a long weekend or even a week in LA. If you're doing the usual tourist things like Knotts Berry or Disneyland you're going to want to stay someplace closer to those areas, but if you want to be in trendy and veddy chic West LA and be approx. 5 minutes from a freeway entrance that will take you anywhere in LA, this should be your temporary home. It's 100x nicer than the similiarly priced motels in the area or down in Santa Monica. STAY AWAY from some of the beachfront Santa Monica motels. They SOUND good, but you'll be hearing foot traffic until 2 am on a regular night as well as cars and the normal people screaming on a weekend in Santa Monica.I endured a night of this before checking in to the Inn and got the FIRST decent sleep I'd had since arriving in LA 3 days ago. Those sound proof doors REALLY work and you can shut the world out and then go out when you're ready. The Inn really is a little Oasis amongst the madness that is LA.Hope this helped. 2 Thumbs WAY UP!!

<Content>Exceeds the Gold Standard for Customer Serice I just returned from a quick business trip where I stayed at The Brentwood Inn. From beginning to end, Kanuja did everything she could to make my stay the best possible - checking me in early, offering refreshments when she learned that I hadn't had lunch, suggesting things to do, printing out my boarding pass, and being so polite. I even got a message saying that there had been a wake-up call request that they thought was left over from the previous guest. They cancelled it but asked that I call back if I still wanted the wake-up call.The room was clean, comfortable, and very 21st century with the plasma TV, remote control for HVAC, a two-alarm clock radio, and a high-tech system for preventing folks from leaving the lights on when leaving the room. I agree that the bathroom, at least in my room, was on the small side, but it was fine for the single traveler. Even the shower had its own ventilation system. Plus there were mirrors galore, and free high-speed Internet access in the room (they'll supply Ethernet cables if you don't have one).I really enjoyed the continental breakfast, especially since there was my favorite - oatmeal! The location was quiet and within walking distance of both nice neighborhoods where you can safely get some exercise and the farmers' market on Sunday mornings.Normally, I stay in the Westwood area, but I will definitely The Brentwood Inn to my list. This former motor lodge has been in the family for two decades, and they definitely know how to treat guests like royalty.

<Content>a true gem I had the pleasure of staying at the brentwood inn for a month while on business. Kanuja and JC, the owners, are an absolute delight. They have put their heart and soul into making sure every single detail of your visit is perfect. If you need something, ANYTHING, they will find a way to get it to you. They removed the feather bedding in my room before I even arrived and replaced it with down-alternative. They even went so far as to place a hepa air filter in my room (I have bad allergies). Talk about service?!!!!! I have never met such kind, generous, helpful people in my life! The rooms are impeccably clean and pretty with great beds, linens, a plasma tv, fresh flowers and mini fridge. My favorite part was my corner room, having lots of windows I could open-- it felt like home! oh wait- maybe it was the aveda products that are replenished daily?!! Every morning they have a little buffet of fresh muffins, croissants, danishes, oatmeal, yogurt and fruit along with teas and coffee. Right off the lobby/front office there is a pretty little patio with cute smith and hawken furniture and a little water fall where you can enjoy your breakfast and read the NY times in the sun. After breakfast you can talk a long walk in the nice surrounding neighborhoods.I truly felt like I was at home here-- I practically was after a month!! The Brentwood Inn is a true gem in such a busy city- Thanks again Kanuja, JC, and Evan, you guys are amazing ! Namaste my friends :) hope to see you again one day! steph

<Content>Can't get your money back if you cancel We were supposed to stay at the Brentwood Inn on September 23, but my fiance got sick and we had to cancel. The Brentwood Inn would not give us a refund or even let us apply our payment to another night. That cost us more than $200! Be prepared to lose your full payment if you get sick on a Sunday and you don't have a doctor's note to prove it.

<Content>Great hotel, Excellent Staff My husband and I spent three nights at the Brentwood Inn recently while we were in town for a wedding. We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel, and a family member recommended the Brentwood. We were thrilled with the hotel's location (minutes from Santa Monica and a beautiful drive up highway 1 to Malibu), clean (though slighly small) rooms, and a fantastically helpful and welcoming staff. We highly recommend it, and will certainly be back ourselves!

<Content>Decent Stay but Overpriced for a Cute Little Motor Inn Pros: - Good location in West LA/Brentwood- Rooms are very clean and the bedroom area is decorated in a soothing minimalist way- Housekeeping did an excellent job and also responded to our small requests- Helpful staffCons: - Very cramped rooms with small closet area. It鈥檚 better suited for a solo business traveler than a couple due to the tight layout. We were constantly saying 鈥渆xcuse me鈥?just to get by each other. - Bathrooms are also pretty narrow with a pocket door. There is only a tiled shower stall with a timer (would feel more spacious glassed-in). Our shower ceiling fan directly overhead had what looked like some reddish mold or rust beyond the plastic ducts.- Room can get very stuffy unless the AC is run.Recommended upgrades:- Completely cover or remove skylight to better darken bedroom in the early mornings- Update showerhead to adjustable version instead of fixed and update old shower handle fixtures.- Needs dual pane windows and curtains to block out noises/sirens from Sunset Blvd and light from outside.- Continental breakfast of baked goods could include yogurt and/or fresh fruitThe Brentwood Inn was decent, but for an average of the mid to upper 200鈥檚 per night, next time we鈥檒l definitely be staying elsewhere at more spacious nearby options we had contemplated that have a similar aesthetic and accommodation amenities in the same price range.

<Content>The Brentwood Inn: A welcome respite. The Brentwood Inn is a welcome respite from the usual hotel chain mentality in guest services.We recently stayed for three nights and Canuja and J.C. were extremely gracious and accomodating during our stay. Continental breakfast and afternoon tea, cookies and fruit served in the lobby allowed interaction with the wonderful staff and fellow guests. The neighborhood location offers destinations within walking distance.Yes, we did miss having a pool, but the entire stay was so pleasant we'll return again.

<Content>Great Brentwood My husband and I stayed at the Brentwood from the 15th May till 20th May. We had a great stay. The Brentwood Inn is situated in a wealthy area of Los Angeles where many stars have their homes. Unfortunately we didn't spot any! We felt safe in the area and were able to walk around at any time of day. The Inn is about a 15 minute walk to the centre of Brentwood where there are shops and restaurants including the Cheesecake Factory. The Brentwood Inn is conviently located to visit the main tourist attractions in LA and is also only a 10 minute drive to Santa Monica. The Brentwood Inn is geared towards the business traveller. The rooms are small but immaculate and with a very modern feel. The owners of the Inn are incredibly helpful and go out their way to answer questions and offer suggestions of things to do. There is a complimentary breakfast which consists of muffins and pastries, tea and coffee.

<Content>GREAT LITTLE GEM WITH HEART AND SOUL I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Brentwood for a month while consulting with a medical specialist in LA. The hotel was recommended by the Doctor who is located in Brentwood. This little gem of an inn is run by an intelligent, charming and entertaining young couple who live on site.The Inn is a true reflection of it's loving owners. The owners have instilled their values of unending graciousness to the small staff, and there is not an unfriendly face on the premises. At checkin I was greeted by name, warmly welcomed with organic teas and fresh baked cookies and instructed on the best places to dine that night. along with what I should do the next morning. (including visit the local farmers market, a one block walk). Both of the owners who frequently man the reception area and the two young staff members treat the positon as a cross between a 5 star consierge service and the best tips from a true local. I don't think it is possible to make a request that the owners have not already anticipated and provided for.Due to the friendliness of the owners and staff the lobby is the central gathering place for this Inn. The lobby reflects the warmth of the management with dark hardwoodfloors, catherdral ceilings, a stone fireplace, comfortable furnishings, the LA and NewYork Times for leisure perusal, and a wireless MAC computer for visitor use. -Mornings are spent over muffins, croissants, fruit, juice, milk, coffee and teas in this lovely setting or outside on the stone patio wifh seating and a waterfall for a rather zen like atmosphere.The rooms are small but cozy with great beds, an abudndance of pillows, fabulous linens,. The wood beamed catherdral ceililngs make them feel more spacious and the lighting is very thoughtfully designed. This hotel under the guidance of it's young owners recently underwent a major renovation and more improvements are in process. While I was staying at the Brentwood new large flat screen TVs were installed for perfect bed viewing. Knowing that I was a football fan looking forward to the superbowl, the owners made sure my new TV was installed the morning of the superbowl! How much better can serviced get.I understand that new furniture was also in production and may even be in place now. Everything is neat clean and well cared for.The location is perfect, tucked into the residential neighborhood of Brentwood and within easy walking distance to tons of area restruanants and Boutiques.And you could not stay with nicer people.

<Content>Great location. Terrific owners and staff! I had an very enjoyable stay at this hotel. I was there for 5 days and really appreciated the fact that I could walk though an attractive neighborhood to get to stores, shops and restaurants.The owners and staff are very friendly and exceptionally helpful with directions, things to see and places to go. My room was very clean and comfortable. I don't spend a lot of time hanging around my room when I travel and it was great to be near major attractions without feeling like you are in a crowded area of town. LA is hectic enough without having your hotel stuck in the middle of the bustle. This hotel is in a nice residential area only 10 minutes from the Getty museum and 5 minutes to Rt 405. Malibu is only a 25 minute drive away. If you travel a lot you'll appreciate this place.

<Content>Overpriced but otherwise ideal I've stayed here three times. Once pre-renovation when it was a very basic and inexpensive older motel, once mid-renovation when things were looking up, and last month after most of their renovation was complete.In many ways it's an ideal place to stay, IMO. It's in a nice neighborhood, location is pretty good right on Sunset with the 405 close by. The Getty center is 10 minutes away. You can get checked in and out quickly, no fuss, easy parking. Rooms are straightforward and nice, no excess. This is not a 4 star hotel. There are basically no amenities. It's a nice place to sleep, not to hang out. Breakfast is decent - coffee, fruit, muffins and croissants, juice if you ask for it. The owners are nice and helpful. Fridge in the room is a plus.I don't like big huge hotels with parking hassles, annoying staff in my face, etc. And a lot of the smaller/chain motels in LA tend to be crappy and poorly located. This place bridges the gap. The downside - it is overpriced, although I recenly got 4 nights for $159 though this was mid week.It can also get noisy in the morning with Sunset traffic nearby.

<Content>Not worth it! (Overrated) I don't know how this is the 6th best hotel in LA as their website (the Brentwood Inn) is completely misleading as there are no cottages. It's set up like a motel and their website has some very strategic photos to show internet marketing at it's finest.I checked in early and was able to get my room within an hour which was nice and the staff was friendly, but the rooms are nothing special. Basically--it's an expensive motel ($200+/night). The rooms are small and the bathroom is pretty blah as well. The skylight is a bit annoying in the morning especially if you wanted to sleep in. And lastly--the breakfast assortment included muffins, fruit and croissants--once again there is nothing to rave about. I wouldn't recommend this MOTEL to anyone as it's a rip off .

<Content>Not sure I agree with the other reviews .... Not sure I agree with the last couple of reviews regarding The Brentwood. Sure, the one staff member that spoke to me on check in was very friendly. When my husband checked in a day later to meet up with me he was told there was no booking under our name, so that was a bit of a challenge for him to get into our room. ( we had no mobiles to contact each other)The breakfast is nothing special - a couple of muffins and a couple of apples is not exactly what I thought would greet me.The water feature - sure, it is certainly very nice, especially if you enjoy the traffic noises coming from behind it.As far os each bungalow being separate - this isn't entirely true - they are all connected like a motel. AND lastly, the sky light - they really should consider getting rid of these - the light shining in the room in the morning is very painful if you want to have a bit of a sleep in.

<Content>Best Kept Secret in Brentwood I have been staying at this little property weekly ever since I discovered it in June of 2005. Recommended by a business associate, I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else, now. The property is under $200/per night, consistently clean, rooms are charming, the owners work there almost every night and are the nicest young couple you could ever meet. This is a property that says we really care about your experience  in every way. High Speed internet both cable and wireless (they even provide the cable if needed), refrigerator and coffee maker in every room. Fully tiled cozy bathroom with great shower - instantly hot and good water pressure. Vaulted ceiling and a remote controlled air conditioning unit with amazingly creative features for guest comfort even after you're in bed. Great little continental breakfast with a water featured guest patio for morning and evening relaxation with cookies, hot tea or coffee and fruit in the evenings. Best experience for frequent travelers I have ever found and I have traveled all my life. Just try it once and you'll be hooked. Thanks to the caring and friendly owner/managers; keep up the wonderful experience you have created there!

Each guestroom is a separate bungalow, so it's like you have your own private residence on the grounds -- a nice change from staying in hotels. The room I stayed in was clean and bright.I felt very safe there as a single traveler, and the staff was very friendly and helpful regarding transportation to the hotel.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Santa Monica/Brentwood area.

The only thing I would do different on a return stay is to request a room without the skylight. It's as if a spotlight is shinning down upon you to wake you before you're ready! Otherwise, it's a charming place. After we left we were even telephoned and told we had left an item behind.

<Content>Great Experience at The Brentwood We stayed at The Brentwood for 1 week the 1st part of July. It was a wonderful vacation thanks to the friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the inn. The rooms are small but very updated- track lighting on vaulted wooden ceilings, remote control AC and heat, Aveda products, mini refrigerator with bottled water restocked daily and whenever you need it, and a small but very efficient and relaxing shower! It was like staying in a small trendy cottage in some ways. Parking is free, and it was great to be able to walk outside your room to the car. The landscaping on the grounds is beautiful-take advantage of the patio with cascading wall of water! Muffins, other breakfast pastries, fresh fruit, coffee, and gourmet teas are included- we ate on the patio as often as possible. Our host even packed breakfast bags for us to take on the plane as we were leaving the next day before breakfast!! We also enjoyed walking through the neighborhood each morning- it is about a 15-20 minute walk to the main street, San Vicente, which has lots of shops and restaurants/cafes. Dutton Books is a great place to stop. Our hosts, who are a young couple, and all the staff were very accommodating and gave us lots of good suggestions about things to do and places to go. The J. Paul Getty Center is only about 10 minutes away, too. There is wireless connection and you can also borrow a computer in the office if you didn't bring one. We will certainly return to this great find!

<Content>Nice Place to Stay I would stay here again. Place is kept clean and staff is more than friendly and knowledgable about surrounding eateries and things to do. If you are a light sleeper it might be too noisy because it's next to the blvd. The only other negative aspect is the skylight. There's no control over the light coming into the skylight on the ceiling. It's annoying in the morning when you're trying to sleep in.

<Content>What a gem! The Brentwood Inn is an absolute gem. It's nestled in a lovely area along Sunset Boulevard, just a mile west of I-405. The two women working the front office are warm and helpful, as is one of the resident managers who kindly brought an iron to my room at 11:00 one night.My room was very clean and a winning mix of charm and hi-tech. It was a little on the small side, but laid out to maximize space. Though I think some parts of the room would be too snug for two people. My corner room had a skylight, white shutters as blinds, and furnishings in rich colors. Very home-y. A remote control allows guests to adjust the room's climate. The hotel has business travelers in mind, offering free wireless internet, free bottled water, a nice-sized refrigerator, and a desk with a good workspace. Women are also catered to. I appreciated the many useful mirrors and Aveda toiletries, for starters. As a woman traveling alone, I felt secure, even though I usually avoid hotels where rooms open directly onto the parking lot. The free breakfast of muffins, fruit, and coffee/tea fit the bill. The best part was eating breakfast in the small courtyard edged with a long fountain. You'd never guess busy Sunset Boulevard was on the other side of the tall privacy fence.This is really minor, but the only thing I wish I had asked about was a full-sized ironing board. I made do with the table-top one in my room, but later learned I could have requested a full-sized one. I travel to Los Angeles two or three times a year on business and I'll certainly make the Brentwood Inn my first choice.

<Content>Hospitality Inn If you're looking for hospitality at your next lodging, you will find it here. The proprietors are warm, friendly and kind. They graciously try to help me out with whatever needs I have when I arrive. It's a cozy and comfortable little getaway place. Their office serves as the lobby and has a warm fireplace inside with a beautiful waterfall courtyard outside; they serve complimentary cookies and tea in the evenings, and in the morning they offer pastries, fruit and coffee/tea; a perfect place to sit and relax after I take a walk. And all of this comes with a big smile... always! The area around the Inn is great for taking walks and, if you want to, you can even walk to a restaurant of your choice for dinner or whatever. I'm glad I discovered The Brentwood Inn. It's where I always stay when I am in Los Angeles near UCLA.

Regarding location: it would be difficult to do much better as everything is quite close (including the Getty). This hotel, of course, would not be a good pick for someone seeking a high-energy or party atmosphere. It was a relaxing and enjoyable place to spend time in Los Angeles.

<Content>Not Bad, But Not The Bel-Air Hotel This place has a definite air of 1940's nostalgia to it, though they have renovated the place since I last stayed there. The Brentwood Inn does have some charm, but I would not stay here again, due to the fact that this place is so darn noisy, as it faces very busy Sunset Blvd.

<Content>Lovely little place It was our first trip to LA and after a long journey from the airport (due to the traffic which seemed to be a nightmare the whole time we were in LA)we were pleasantly surprised with the Brentwood Inn. It looks quaint from the outside and it was nice to be able to park right outside our room. It was a nice touch that they baked fresh cookies and muffins which were left in Reception and were sooo good. The room was very clean and cosy. If I for some reason ever was to go to LA again then this would be where I would stay as its in a nice area and near enough to Santa Monica for the restaurants etc.

<Content>Such a Treat! We enjoyed a evening at the Brentwood Inn, and it was lovely. We've stayed at many a boutique hotel in LA, and the Inn is by far the best. The hosts are warm and welcoming, and their attention to detail unsurpassed. They have done an excellent job of modernizing the property without sacrificing it's charm. Not only are the rooms sparkling clean and cozy, but the grounds are impeccibly maintained. Nowhere else in the city can you enjoy ALL the perks the Inn has to offer. The (free) parking is right in front of your door, the beds warm and comfy, internet access free. We'll be back!

<Content>Disappointing Booked this hotel because of the rave reviews in Tripadvisor. What we got was somewhat disappointing. Hotel (sorry Motel) was easy to find but difficult to get to as it's on the wrong side of road if you are comming from the freeway. Rooms were small and bathroom and shower are minute. We were located on the bottom level and you could hear the rooms above and the stairs outside. Breakfast was a muffin/fruit which you collected from reception. There were no seats there, so you had to take food back to your room. On the plus side the rooms are clean with fridge  coffee facilities and the reception staff are helpfull. It's also close to the Getty Museum (2 miles) and the restaurants in Barrington (1 mile). OK for a stop over but would not recommend for a longer stay. During our holiday we had better rooms for less price in Best Westerns.
