<Content>a great place to stay In December 2008 I took a tour from Bangkok to Singapore - which ended at The Royal Peacock Hotel - one night - as part of the tour. I wanted to stay an extra night but the rates were too high so I looked for an alternative. I stumbled upon Hotel 1929 and I'm so pleased I did. When we checked into the Peacock I noticed that it was directly opposite the 1929 and as there was no wireless internet access in the Peacock I went over the road to check whether they had access at 1929. The staff were just so helpful - they confirmed that they do have wirelss access in the hotel lobby and after checking my reservation for the following day gave me access to the wireless broadband a day early. A Small thing, I know, but it's the small things that make a big difference. The rooms are very small - but also very comfortable. The staff are incredibly friendly and the place is spotless. It is a VERY modern hotel so someone looking for something more traditional won't find it here. Unfortunately, the terrace and jacuzzi were closed due to a breakdown when I was there - but they had people working to fix the problem asap - even though it was Christmas day. A great place to stay!

<Content>Too small to be pleasant We decided to write a review while searching for a hotel for a new trip in December/January 2008/09 and recalled this hotel.There is cheap and terrible and expensive and terrible. We felt on balance that 1929 falls into the latter.It is a a soulless refurbished building with rooms so small that it was uncomfortable for our five days there, but having pre-paid we decided to grin and bear it. The room was so small that the toilet and shower were together and there was no room to move around. We aren't big westerners but this was cat swinging gone extreme.The smallness of the room meant that it never felt comfortable staying there. The breakfast was okay, nothing great. The restaurant was quite good. Location was good, in an area we like.Basic problem is that the room was ridiculously small and making it boutique does not alter this. Might be suitable for a slight or small single person.

<Content>Nice chairs Single rooms are small, but clean and well-designed; great location (8 min. walk from MRT, 2 min. from heart of Chinatown); staff are very friendly and helpful. I gave it a lower rating because when we were there, they were renovating the restaurant, without giving any prior notice. It made for a very unpleasant entry through the lobby (the caustic chemicals), but at least I never had it permeate my room.

<Content>nightmare in singapore First of all, give the devil his due credit - the hotel locates very close to China down and there are a lot of restaurants and drink places within walking distance. In addition, the folks at front desk are friendly and polite.However, you may not consider it if you are not doing a back-pack trip. It is worse than an average Super 8 in the US. The room is stunningly small. You have to stand over your toilet tub for a shower. Out of my 5 days' stay, I was told there is no hot water supply. The nice locatin also brings a lot of noises. It won't be surprise if the trash truck wakes you up at 1:00 am. Last but not least, they have very tricky policy. If you book 5 nights and want to check out early, they charge you 5 nights' $, very different from a lot of other hotels.

<Content>Cosy room in a good location I was rather apprehensive in choosing this hotel after reading the mixed reviews. However, given the budget that I had, decided to give it a shot. Overall, I would say that it exceeded my expectations. I stayed in a single superior room end July for three nights and was charged SGD170++ per night. Room - It was much smaller that the rooms that I was used to, but it was cosy and adequate. The design was certainly hip and the bed was very comfy.Location - Pretty good - five minutes walk to Outram Park MRT station. I felt safe walking from the station, even at about 11 pm. A taxi ride to Suntec City costs bot SGD9 (off-peak hours). There are some nearby small shopping malls and restaurants serving local cuisine. There is a Hindu temple near the hotel but I wasn't disturbed by the noise in the morning. However, I was awoken by the sound of nearby guests closing their doors bot 4am.Service - Booked the room via email. The receptionist was pretty helpful. Food - buffet breakfast consisted of cereal, fruits, juice, bread, meehoon, coffee or tea. Was also offered a plate of English breakfast - sausage, bacon, baked beans and eggs. Tried the set lunch at its restaurant, Ember which was very delicous. Priced at SGD38 ++, service was also wonderful and very efficient. They are open for lunch and dinner every weekday and only open for dinner on Sat. Closed for business on Sunday. Overall, it was a good experience.

<Content>Dont waste your time Be very wary of this place. We stayed two nights and it was pretty unpleasant. The inroom broadband internet didn't work hotel-wise and despite many guests loudly complaining about it, hotel management replied with a variation of 1)it must be your computer's settings aka not our fault 2)the service is often down (in 'wired' Singapore? dont think so) and 3) its free, so why are you complaining? The website advertised $S170 rates, inc taxes, for a double turn out to be $S230+ when checking out. If those rates have lured you here, read very carefully the return email from the hotel which has an entirely different, higher number on it, the one they hold you to when you check out. And the rooms are minute. One plus, its restaurant Ember is very good. Eat there but suggest staying elsewhere...

<Content>nice stay! The hotel was recently renovated. It is located in Chinatown, very close to Outram park metro station. I have stayed in a single room, it was very clean but tiny. The breakfast was simple but satisfying. The hotel is close to a temple so I heard the bell every morning but that did not disturb me at all. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I certainly reccomend it!

<Content>Stylish but small The Hotel 1929 is a small, stylish hotel. The rooms are sparsely decorated. The standard room is small. The free minibar can literally hold only a bottle of water and a can of cola. The desk is a ledge, but to use the free wired internet, it was more comfortable to sit on the foot of the bed than squeeze into the chair in front of it. (I am a small person, too.) There is minimal storage, although the under-bed drawer was difficult to use as it rolls when opening or closing it, and the drawer would tip when opened due to the weight of items in it. A small safe was also inside the drawer.The included breakfast is mostly western -- you are served a plate of eggs, chicken sausage, bacon, potatoes, and baked beans, and can select from a buffet of croissants, toast, and fresh fruit. There was also a rice porridge or noodle dish. A big automatic espresso machine made coffee, espresso, cappuccino, and the like. Due to their exterior renovation work (as of March 2008), there is currently scaffolding and a sheeting covering their exterior, which also means that you can't open the windows or access the balcony.

<Content>small but good The hotel and its rooms are small (as they say it is) but its a good stay too. The rooms are funky and provided you are not claustrophobic they fit you and your possessions fine. the hotel is in a good location and staff are friendly. I'd recommend it to anyone passing through Singapore.

<Content>I was prepared for 'small,' but... The reviews are pretty accurate. I was stopping over for a day before flying back to the US, and only wanted a simple room. I was ready for a small room, but this was beyond that. Closets are bigger. It was fairly noisy, especially the A/C. I can't imagine being in that room with a second person, especially with the tiny glassed in toilet/shower (No, not a toilet in the same room as the shower -- a toliet under the shower head in a glass box about 2ft in length and width. At least the ceilings are a normal height).Still, free internet and a small fridge in a nice section of the city. 5 minutes from the MRT and an adequate hawker stand. Clean room, OK breakfast (but free, so I can't complain). Polite people at the desk.Overall, it's possible to spend a little more for a lot better room and location, but if you plan on only dropping in to sleep it's certainly clean and cheaper than most everything else (especially now).

<Content>Perfectly fine for a short business trip I spent three nights here in January 2008, due to unavailability of rooms elsewhere. I had a small room on the 4th floor, with no windows but a couple of skylights. What the others say is true....it's small, the desk is a piece of wood coming out of the wall. If you have a lot of stuff, it's probably not for you. There were some noteworthy benefits:1. Free water  soft drinks.2. Free broadband.3. Excellent breakfast4. Rooms without windows are incredibly quiet!5. No bugs.6. No mildew smell so common elsewhere in Singapore7. Friendly staff with good service.If you're out every day and spend little time in the room, Hotel 1929 will be just fine.I would stay at Hotel 1929 again if on my own, but I would not recommend this type of small room for more than one person. The suites looked pretty nice though!

<Content>Just TOO small Firstly, the lady at the front desk, Jasmine I think, was so lovely and helpful and accommodating it's hard to be negative BUT the hotel has some real faults.It's not that the rooms are small, they are badly designed and cramped. There are little to no storage options. I had to keep swapping things from the desk to the floor from the floor to the desk (the 'desk' being a waist-high shelf) in order to accommodate my stuff. The under bed storage wheels itself to the back of the bed when you try to use it, the washbasin is in the room rather than the bathroom with a shelf big enough to hold one toothbrush above it. There is a tiny bedside table which already holds a cube alarm clock so nothing else fits on it. There were two tiny rectangular windows so small and high up that they were pointless and the hot water lasted for, erm, moments.Yes, there is free internet access (becoming standard in many places these days and also, NB, not wireless) and some free drinks but for the price that's NOT enough.If you like the location (Chinatown is amazing and so is the Hindu temple) then stay across the road at the very simple but clean Keong Saik Hotel for one third of the price but twice as big rooms and no flashy designer chair garbage.

<Content>Loved it! The rooms and the hotel has character! Firstly, the hotel advertises the rooms are small, so no surprises there. On arrival the staff are friendly and will answer any questions you have. Although small, the rooms pack a fair amount of punch - they have everything you need! They offer free water and coke a cola, as well as tea and coffee. The beds are extreemly comfortable and the furnishings are wonderful. I rate this hotel and its staff highly - I will be returning!

<Content>Hotel 1929 Worst boutique hotel of the world I write this review from what the hotel called a SUITE ,beleive the hotel management doesn't know what is a suite even in a design boutique hotel.Not enough space to store 2 medium suitcases, queen bed put against a wall with just a small space between it and the shower/toilet unit but a small empty fridge at the oposite ( we were supposed to have complementary drink inside we just found water!). I know the room are quite tiny in this hotel but here is very ridiculous to propose some suite.Even the bed sheet are not very clean, dark stains on it....Only to small towel for a double room!Ok we have very nice bathroom outside on the small terrace but surrounded by housing building ! The lady at the front office was very kind but she seems to be alone in the hotel, we had asked for 2 diet coke and never get them ! We are travelling a lot arround the world and stay only in small boutique hotel and would say this one is the worst. The idea was interresting but the realization did not followed , the owner should visit some boutique hotel elsewhere to know exactly what it looks like ( room design and staff service)

Very small room (literally could not swing a cat - I tried using my towel as a stand-in feline), but everything you need and very clean. Good breakfast was included in my price.

<Content>The smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in! Heard some good things about this place, that it was supposed to be boutique and modern, especially being in an area that is fast becoming a hip part of Singapore. While I was impressed with the area of Keong Saik Road, I was less impressed with the hotel. I was in quite a shock when I opened door to discover the tiniest hotel room I've ever seen. I've stayed in affordable hotels in the UK, Hong Kong, and even Tokyo before where space is a luxury you have to pay for, so I know small rooms. However, those small Japanese, Hong Kong or European rooms are nothing compared to this. The bedroom here literally JUST fits the bed and about a foot of space around it. The whole bathroom is the size of a shower cubicle, no exaggeration. Only that this cubicle contains a sink and a toilet in it. So there is no way you can't wet everything in it, you're pressed up against the toilet when you stand and shower, it's really not very pleasant. What's even less pleasant is when you use the toilet, because the size of the room and glass door for the bathroom, there's no hiding possible! This room cannot be shared! Even if you are a couple and being seen in the toilet is not a problem, you won't be able to hide from the smell or noise either, because the whole room including the bathroom is confined within extremely small space. The room here is barely big enough for one person, so don't even think about trying to share here. There's also no cupboard to keep your clothes, just 2 hooks on the bedroom door and one small rail on the wall near your bed so you can use the hangers. You can't leave your suitcase out because you won't be able to walk in your room if your suitcase is on the floor. However, they have designed the room for functionality that you can store your suitcase and other belongings under your bed. Noise is another problem here. Because the bed is so close to the door, you can hear everyone walking past your room along the corridor. Makes you wonder if they can hear everything you do too. What saves this place from getting the lowest score for me is the staff. I do have to say that they are some of the nicest, and most helpful staff I have seen in any hotel, even in much more upscale and expensive ones. Everyday I was there, I would be greeted and asked about my day on my way out and when I come in. They just seemed really genuinely friendly and warm, which does make you feel better about being there. Also, free internet, free phone calls are great. The free mini-bar is not as great, I think they might be taking the word mini a bit too far. The restaurant here, Ember, is supposed to be very good, but I didn't try it. Did look at the menu and was very impressed with the creative fusion dishes, and a whole page dedicated to just foie gras dishes. My next trip Singapore I do plan to come back here just to eat at Ember. Sadly, I don't think I will be coming back to stay at 1929 again. What can I say, size DOES matter.

<Content>Very Dissapointing Our experience at Hotel 1929 was disappointing to the extent i feel compelled to share our experience with other travelers who may also find this hotel highly recommended via travel guides.From a design perspective, the proprietors did the best with what they had - the result being a cute enough hotel that photographs well. The thing that is not immediately evident however, is that the rooms are TINY - OK if you are alone, but not for a couple. To add to that, the shower/toilet is a glass box 6 from the bed, so there is nothing even close to privacy - and you need to shower above the toilet (the bathroom was also moldy). The biggest problem however was the noise - the walls are not insulated, and there was a 1 gap at the bottom of the door, making everyone's everything extremely audible at all hours of the day and night. The price tag for the stay here was way too high for what amounts to a glorified hostel. Find something else.

<Content>A home away from home My family and I stayed at this hotel for several days this July (July 9-12) since it was near the Singapore General Hospital where I had my checkup. There had been varying reviews to this hotel and I think it is because we have our own expectations and opinions. My family and I enjoyed our stay at the Hotel 1929. I called in to book our reservation to this hotel. The one who answered my queries and booking was very warm and courteous. This was unlike a staff of another hotel nearby who was very rude when I inquired over the phone. My reservation conservation came immediately and there was daily email from the staff with regards to our booking. We arrived on a midnight so we requested for a limousine service. Unfortunately the limousine driver missed us because our flight was delayed and there was a long queue at the immigration. The staff were very accomodating in resolving this problem.  Our room was small by standards but it was cozy. There is a water heater for bath, a small ref, internet connection, television, hairdryer, water heater, aircondition. Sheets were changed daily. There was a welcome note and chocolates from the General Manager and the Asst Manager for Concierge. We were able to sleep soundly, not distrurbed by the noise outside - this despite our room location (at the street corner). Staff was very warm and greeted us always with a smile, all with sunny personality. Thank you for your warm hospitality: to Ms Selria (whom I didnt get to meet personally - probably next time), Ms Angelia (Concierge), Winnie (Restaurant), Zawiyah, Hazley, Satinah, Amin (all from front desk), Ruen and Rashid (housekeeping, second floor). And of course, there was Bob, the bear. Hotel 1929 is our home away from home. It is walking distance to most stores in Chinatown like, to the famous Tiong Shan porridge restaurant, souvenir shops, a five minute walk to Outram Park MRT Station, Singapore General Hospital. Although it is a boutique hotel, you will have that sense of being brought back into time to the old Singapore, sans the high rise buildings... Hoping to visit you again soon

<Content>Loved It I stayed at the 1929 for 2 nights in June 2007 and having read some of reviews on here was terrified it would be awful...quite to the contrary its great!! the rooms although snug were very comfy with a tv,cd player and tea and coffee making facilities as well as a small fridge. All you need in your room. I manage a small hotel in Bali and am very fussy about facilities and cleaniness...having also stayed in many fabulous boutique hotels around the world. the reception staff were great and helpful and fun...I was travelling on my own and they more than happy to help me...and keep me entertained!!! The location is great, outside of the main shopping drag and close to the funky shops of China town, which are way more individual than the huge lifeless shopping malls of Orchard Road. I have really enjoyed my stay here and will definitley be back.You even get complimentary wireless internet...you don't get that in the big 5*'s...so take a risk and give this place a go. Its great for a budget and if I compare it to some of the boutique hotels in New York for example with smaller rooms and much higher prices I'd take this one!! Come here with an open mind and do not expect grandeur or 5*. Its a fun, boutique and ultimately a friendly place!!

<Content>Snug but comfy I lived in Singapore for several years and would stay at Hotel 1929 for in-country get-aways. The staff are very responsive (which is rare in Singapore, which is just beginning to address customer satisfaction) and they remember the faces of the people who have stayed at the hotel previously.Breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel (Ember) lacks variety, but any visit to Singapore should include a visit to one of Singapore's food centres to experience hawker-style cuisine.Rooms are small but cozy. Luggage can be stored under the bed or in the drawers at the foot of the bed (which include small room safe). The toilet in the shower issue that others have commented upon is common in some parts of Asia (and some parts of Europe!) so just make sure that that toilet paper is covered and don't be afraid to ask the staff for extra towels!

<Content>Tiny, Moldy We spent two nights at Hotel 1929 in late February. While the decor is completely and entirely hip, there seems to be some problem with the way they engineered the ventilation. The shower/toilet space (it is just a space, not a room) wreaked of mold. In fact the ceiling was covered with it. When I asked housekeeping if there was anything that could be done, they offered to leave a bottle of air freshner...!!!I asked the front desk staff if they were aware of this issue and if they would offer some time of reduction due to the mold problem, they said that I was the first guest who had ever complained. They also said that all management was on holiday and they could not offer any reduction. While it is a good location, I would steer clear if you have any alergies or if you are claustrophobic, as the rooms are truly tiny.

<Content>truly awful Showering while standing in the toilet is a joke, and remember to be in and out fast, they warn you at check-in that ...the water takes ages to heat up and doesn't last long. The room's are very noisy, both with traffic and other guests. No wardrobes, tiny TV's and 1-can fridges must make this one of the most expensive cupboards in the world.The bed's a single, and makes a lot of noise when you move, and the aircon blows directly in your face while you sleep (to be honest, the room's so small it has no-where else to point).I saw this described as 3 star which is totally misleading, and to see a hotels reviews (and a large part of it's website) based on the chairs in the lobby, show's how little else it has to offer.I checked out 3 days early (was booked by my company for 4 days) and told them I'd rather sleep in the office.Quirky, funky and quiant it might be, comfortable, practical, funcional and fun it definately is not.

<Author>Msg_Singaporean
<Content>Can't Meet Its Obligations I am a Singaporean. I made reservations for 4 guests (2 rooms) at Hotel 1929, who arrived in Singapore on 7 Nov early morning. Reservation was confirmed directly to me by the hotel reservation staff, however when my guests arrived at the hotel, they were told that they is only 1 ROOM left !! I am very unsatisfied and fuming mad at the way the hotel staff handled the matter. As the rooms were not easily available during the past 1 week, we could only find 2 rooms at Robinson Hotel on Balestier Road (which is not convenient at all) for 2 nights. Thereafter, we had to search high  low for accommodation. Hotel 1929 didn't even offer to arrange transportation to send my 4 guests to the alternative accommodation. The guests took a cab to Robinson Hotel.One couple was here for honeymoon. They enjoyed themselves in Maldives and was throwm from heaven to hell !. I felt so sorry to my guests.So whoever wants to stay at this hotel (they have a newly opened hotel known as New Majestic Hotel), be prepared to be left in the lurch and take the risks of having to stay out on the street if you do not have any friends in Singapore. I hope this unhappy incident to happen to another innocent soul because I would be equally mad if such unhappy incident happen to me in a foreign land. This was reflected to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) who only acts as a postbox to deliver my message to Hotel 1929. The STB is able to do nothing - so don't expect much ! Two compliments to Summer View Hotel. Even though Summer View is probably a 3 star hotel, I find that their service is very good :-(i) the staff offer to pack breakfast for my guests who need to leave the hotel at 5.30am to catch their flight. This is a very kind gesture of them.(ii) The uncle/security guard (I think he is in his 60s) who is working at the carpark behind the hotel highlighted to us that the exit door to the carpark would be shut after 11pm, so we had to leave from the front door. Wonderful service - much appreciated.

<Content>Cool Place This hotel is just a cool/hip place in Singapore. It offers great value for money and is close to all attractions in China Town. The only downside is that the rooms are very small, but hey one doesn't go to Singapore to spend time in the room!!

<Content>Great decor design but small room and little sleep The hotel lobby has a very interesting design and is rather psychedelic in an Austin Powers sort of way. The room was small - no cupboard to hang clothes, only a few hooks on the wall for hanging clothes and some space below the bed for storing clothes and other stuff. The bathroom walls are made of glass, not least to show off the nice mosaic tiling design and also give the room a feel that it is bigger than it really is. I stayed on my own so didnt have the problem faced by other commentators of having to lose dignity in heeding the call of Mother Nature in full view of their partners. The hotel was converted from a pre-war shophouse, so as with the nature of these buildings the sounds from the streets can echo into the room easily. After I reflected this to the staff, he promptly changed my room to one that faced the back of the street. Even so, I was still bothered by sound. The blinds also do not shield out light sufficiently in the way that I am used to, so I really had some problems getting enough sleep because of the brightness and sounds. In conclusion, you can consider this hotel if you are happy to sleep very little, love modern art designs and wish to feel exotic.

<Content>Too loud for a decent night of sleep. The main complaint is how noisy it was at night. I got the side facing the road.The hotel is close to some eating places that open till midnight and I could hear people talking and other noises that sound like a compressor or perhaps just the kitchen till midnight, then, those noises went away, only to be replaced by what seemingly sound like BIG trucks but are simply cabs looking for potentially customers every 3-5 mins. They get really loud. I had a sleepless night, but luckily got out at 4am the second night to catch a flight.The door that opens out to the balcony look a little old and definitely does no help in keeping the noise out. For the same price, you can find a much better hotel elsewhere, one on a high floor please.Also the restaurant was being renovated at that time and I was only notifed when I checked in. Breakfast which consisted of some unappetizing sausage and eggs was instead served in a small plastic container. I wasn't too happy with this.

<Content>Not value for money Same problems as everyone else: I booked the smallest room they had and that room was so ridiculously tiny that I could easily get rooms that are double or triple that size for the same price elsewhere in Singapore. You do shower standing right next to the toilet and the water leaks out of the door into your room. The resulting puddle was 1 step away from my bed. The garbage truck arrived early in the morning and there was no soundproofing. Breakfast was slow, cold and sad - the coffee was worse than Nescafe instant coffee. The chairs are beautiful, as is the lobby but the rooms made me feel too claustrophobic. There are many other much better alternatives in Singapore. I only planned to stay one night, but it wasn't a great night. Not recommended!

<Content>Beautiful but disappointing After reading the reviews of the Hotel 1929 online me and my boyfriend were prepared for a very small room. But we never expected SUCH a small room...Although the room was lovingly decorated we were not able to open our suitcases and the very spare storage area was just enough to deposit our mobiles and some sunglasses.The bed was big enough, the matress hard enough and the AC fully adjustable to our wishes. Within five minutes we could reach nice little bars and great food was just around the corner as well: The famous Maxwell Hawker Centre is close by. The staff was very helpful and nice and free soft drinks were provided in the room.So far so good. Upon arrival I asked myself why there was a tiny musical clock in the room. Soon I found out: One corner of our already very small room was designated as bathroom meaning that behind a glass wall there was a shower and toilet. The glass wall was partly frosted; just enough to allow a minimum of sanitary privacy. But no way to block any sounds... Well, time for the musical clock!Unfortunately the breakfast was a joke. Our eggs came along with some baked beans, greasy bacon and rubberlike potato wedges, the buffet consisted only of prepacked jam and butter plus toast. My advice for future travellers: Better skip the breakfast and dig into some delicious noodle soup in one of the Chinese restaurants around the corner.In conclusion I must admit that the Hotel 1929 looks better than it feels. Sure, the design is awesome and very cool. But staying in this hotel is not the great experience we were looking forward to. Better go there for a dinner and stay someplace else.

<Content>Cool hotel. I would rate this hotel as neutral but I'm a sucker for the design of the place. Very hip-retro-funky style but the standard rooms are pretty tight. I stayed there awhile back but have seen it in a number of travel mags since. My taxi driver said that we were in the red light district, but it sure didn't seem like it. Within walking distance (half a mile or so) to the train and Chinatown, so there's no shortage of access to the rest of the Singapore. Just be ready to squeeze into a small room. Mine had a single twin bed and the toilet was in the shower which took some getting used to. If you're going to spend a lot of time in the room then maybe not for you, but if you want to stay at a cool little hotel for a night or two, this is a pretty neat place to stay.

<Content>1929 Not my type of Hotel Arrived in SIN with no reservation and went to Airport hotel desk where they have excellent rates on available rooms in city.. Since was only for three nights and had heard about 1929, that it was new and hip, I said why not. The rate was okay, I was alone. My room size was 9 feet by 10 feet, and that included the bath (much smaller than the master bath in my home.The room in a motor home is larger. The shower was in the toilet or was it the toliet in the shower, anyway they were together. Only a glass wall between toilet and bed so you could not have a private moment even if you could get 2nd person in room (which I doubt). No closet, no place to put luggage, bed 2/3 or 3/4 size. You could sit on bed and wash your hands in the sink (it was that close). Although my room was on back the AC units from hotel rooms and nearby buildings keep me awake. Thank goodness no one used the jacuzzi because it was just outside my room and no sound proofing. Anytime anyone came or went nearby you knew it. They advertise free mini bar (yes, one coke . one juice and one water). Bed very hard and uncomfortable. The restaurant off the lobby gets good reviews by local press but is not run by the hotel. I found it okay. After one night in 1929, I changed to the very nice Intercontinental, where the entrance hall to my room was larger than my complete room including bath in the 1929. If you like very cozy this hotel may be okay, but was not my cup of tea.

<Content>Disappointed I was eager to try this hotel after hearing so much about it. The overall experience was, however, very disappointing. As others have pointed out, the rooms were exceptionally small. I was a single traveller and upgraded myself to a double room after the first night in the single which was claustrophobic. The hotel should have been designed with fewer rooms; the bigger rooms would have been more inviting to visitors, and also promote return visits.There was also considerable sounds from the air-conditioning units outside the room and even in my new room on the top floor the wall insulation from the corridor was very poor.On the positives, the hotel is situated in a unique area of the city with a delightful old-style coffee shop next door serving excellent coffee and soft boiled eggs and kaya toast. The hotel's restaurant is also excellent. I would return for this, but not for the rooms.

<Content>Great Hotel for Something Different I stayed at Hotel 1929 from March 17-20 in a Deluxe Room, and had a very good experience. Unlike many hotels, many 'extras' were included in the cost of my room--that means no additional charge for broadband internet, soft drinks and water in my fridge, and breakfast.The staff was very friendly and attentive, and genuinely wanted to make my stay an enjoyable one. Try to get a reservation at Ember, the restaurant next door--amazing!The downsides--I'd say my room was rather small, but also well designed, so that I never felt cramped. It's worth upgrading--I'd say they're 20% larger than the standard rooms. My only other gripe was that the room wasn't very soundproofed--I could hear trucks driving by at all hours, and people entering their rooms.I wanted some different than the generic chains seen throughout Singapore--and got it! It was a fun place to stay, with a GREAT location, and good service. However, if you're looking for the usual perks of a major chain--large rooms, a gym, quiet, etc., then you might want to look elsewhere.

<Content>Great for young people on a stopover We stayed at this hotel for two nights. Yes the rooms are very very small. But they are new, modern, quirky, comfortable and clean.The jacuzzi was nice and we sat there everyday for a brief moment.Staff were flexible and the lady at breakfast was amazing- She remembered how everyone likes their eggs.We liked this place and would go back there but ask for a larger room.Definitly worth a try if you are young, travelling light and like attention to detail and contemporary design.
