<Content>Superb Grace Under Fire by Hotel Staff My family stayed here on both ends of a trip to Hawaii in December 2008. ( We've stayed at a lot of hotels near the Sea Tac airport, and I think that we've finally found a good one that meets our needs.) Dozens of flights in and out of the airport had been canceled because of a snowstorm. Three feet of snow had fallen at our home in Spokane and the city was coping, but three inches of snow in Seattle and the city grinds to a complete halt! The shuttle easily took us from the airport the short distance to the hotel. Our check in was perfect without any problems, which was a little surprising considering the long long of guests waiting at the counter. Because of the storm, many employees had been held over at the hotel and not gone home. Dozens had worked back to back shifts and many had stayed overnight themselves. (When it snows in Seattle, the city stops suddenly and transportation is very difficult.) The front desk staff could have been cranky but they weren't. I could tell they were tired, but they all seemed to pull together to help out. That's a good sign in the hotel industry. I came in contact with quite a few hotel staff members and they all seemed to want to pitch in and help to get through the crisis. I saw more smiles than frowns. We had connecting king rooms 2105 and 2107 on the ground floor across the hall from several conference and meeting rooms. ($119 plus tax) They were big and comfortable. Everything worked. The bathrooms were a bit small and, for some reason, the toilets were angled diagonally out from the corner of the bathroom, but everything was neat and clean. The business center's two computers and two printers worked. There is a Spencer's steak restaurant in the lobby, and while the food was pretty good it was unusually expensive and the service was unbearably slow. I'll give the restaurant staff some credit for dealing with the bad weather and I'm guessing that a lot of employees weren't able to show up for work, but dinner for four took two hours and cost $250. The waiters all seemed to ignore us, as did the receptionist and the manager. That could have been a better experience and the restaurant itself is not a self-contained unit, it's in a corner of the lobby and during our stay it was extremely cold and drafty. Our nights were peaceful and room service breakfast arrived precisely at the time we had ordered it, which is a very good thing! The fan/air conditioning/heating system in our room seemed extremely noisy. It would have been nicer if it was quieter. Even though there's an outdoor pool on site, it would have been nice if a facility this big had an indoor pool as well. But you can't have everything! This hotel is close to the airport, clean and comfortable with a good restaurant in house. There's a lot to like here. We'll be back.

<Content>Bad experience this is a nice hotel...had comfortable beds but the housekeeping is slacking. We were on our last leg of our vacation coming from Vancouver BC. The room they gave us had dried pee all over the toilet seat and dripped all the way on the floor. I complained and they sent housekeeping while we went around Seattle. When we came back it is still dirty, seemed like they just cleaned the floor. Anyway we were so disgusted thinking what kind of things the previous guest did to that room and housekeeping could not thoroughly clean. Finally requested to be put in a new room and that one seemed to be a lot cleaner. Check in was fast, guest service was great except for a certain male receptionist during check out who was smug and unapologetic when I mentioned the problem we had. Would not stay there again.

<Content>Excellent airport hotel in Seattle This is the airport we stay at whenever we fly out of SeaTac. It is one of the few airport hotels with 鈥渆xtended park and jet鈥?rates, so if you are going away for a couple of weeks, for just a few dollars more than you would spend to park your car at an off-airport lot, you can get a room for the night across from the airport and not have to get up quite so early for your morning flight. There is a 24 hour shuttle service to and from the airport, and we have never waited more than 10 minutes for it. On your return to Seattle, when you call the shuttle from the airport you also give your valet number, and your car will be waiting for you at the front of the hotel by the time you get there. The rooms themselves are of average size and clean, with all the usual amenities. The beds are comfortable, and staff are friendly and helpful. The fitness room has lots of treadmills and ellipticals, plus free weights. There is a restaurant on site, though we have not eaten there so cannot comment on it.We have stayed at several hotels near SeaTac in the past, but this is the one we inevitably return to and have the best experiences with.

<Content>Parking free for guests and I don't understand the complaints..awesome hotel!!! I don't get the complaints about the hotel and parking. It's free for guests, just use your room key. Did you look into that and ask at the desk? The room was quiet, the front desk people were very nice, and I'm typing in the business center...totally free with room key.The bed is comfortable (already took a nap) and the TV works great. There is a very comfortable chair to watch TV in, which is important to me, I can't stand the bed for tv :-) The parking garage is a bit far from the room, but I needed the exercise anyway :-)

<Content>Good overall stay We stayed 2 nights at this airport hotel. At first we wanted to stay downtown the 2nd night but we couldn't get a hotelroom under the price limit we set downtown.Afterwards we were quite happy that we stayed 2 nighs in the Hilton.We liked the accomodations and also the staff was friendly. We didn't have any noise problems with the planes and if you have a car you can easily visit Seattle Downtown after a 20 minutes drive which is not too bad.On the other hand I disliked the 18$ parking fee for which I couldn't find cheaper alternatives in that area. Also as usual Hilton is not offering free internet access which is a shame for a 4 star hotel according to me. If you have a mobile phone with WIFI you can pick up free signals when you talk a walk around the hotel. You'll see ;)

<Content>Nice Place, Close to the Airport I stayed at this Hilton because I had to catch a 7:00 AM flight from Seattle to Los Angeles the next morning. I was able to turn in my rental car the night before, because this Hilton runs a shuttle to the airport 24/7. The hotel is a four story building on a main road very close to the airport... not your usual high rise.When I arrived at the hotel, I found the staff at the front door and front desk to be exceptionally helpful and friendly. Before going up to my room, I used the complimentary business center (two computers and a working printer) to check-in to my flight the next day. Room service for dinner was expensive and mediocre in quality. Suggest you go elsewhere.I did have a couple of maintenance issues... a broken, hanging fluorescent bulb in the bedside lamp (possible fire hazard?), and a loose faucet handle in the bathroom. I reported the bulb, of course. Otherwise the room was nice enough.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Pretty nice - beware $18 parking fee I landed a room for here for $65 on Priceline for a Friday evening stay....I see that some have gotten rooms even cheaper. Pretty nice airport hotel....standard Hilton. Housekeeping seemed to be a little slack....there was an empty wine glass sitting in the hallway across from our room when we checked in, and it was still there the next morning when we checked out. The toilet in our room was also clogged when we arrived. Otherwise.....no problems. Nice comfy beds and good linens.....quiet place, even though our room fronted on Pacific Hwy. The $18 ($20 with tax!) parking is pretty outrageous, but they do have a 24 hour shuttle to sea-tac if you can avoid bringing a car.

<Content>Don't stay here Dilapidated, out of date, dreary, ground-floor, facing a multistory carpark (which illuminated my room all night) and reeking of smoke - that was what I found when I finally arrived at my non-smoking room, that is, after pushing my luggage myself through corridor after corridor, and the ballroom! Even the corridor reeked of smoke. At reception I was studiously ignored for nearly half an hour whilst another inmate tried to get some satisfaction for his flooded room. Finally I was checked in to my non-smoking room and given a map of how to get there. As I was on my way to a boat trip I had too much luggage to carry myself, so I asked about assistance and was told to get one of the trolleys round the corner. It was one of those big things with gold bars over the top. Another woman was just returning the trolley and gave me advice on how to get to the room, via a short-cut which took about 10 minutes off the walk and I was very grateful to her. I was nearly dead on my feet after flying from France via London, having had to depart France nearly 24 hrs previously. It took me about 20 minutes at least to walk to the room. For this I paid 120 euros on Expedia (the French version) . It seems to be impossible to book on the American site from France, although I could see it was a bit cheaper. All in all from my arrival at the hotel it was over an hour before I got into the room. I'm afraid I was just way too tired to complain at that stage.

<Content>One night was enough Stayed here for one night for business. Nice looking lobby, but odd set up. Lots of food trays on the ground in the hallways. I mean lots. I had to wonder how long they had been there. The hallways were also very dark adding to the creepy food on the floor ambience.Staff seemed nice enough. Very convenient to the airport and seemed quiet enough- but I had to be up extra early to catch my flight.I didn't eat here, but the restaurant looked nice. The ceiling reminded me of the Venetian ceiling in Vegas.The room was comfortable, but it seemed like a long walk to an elevator.

<Content>Use shuttle; don't park We used Priceline to get this hotel for a weekend night at $55 when arriving at the airport in the evening. I called in advance to find out the shuttle procedure--up and over to aisle 1 or 3, then use the courtesy phone. Shuttle there in 5 minutes. Although we were going to use a car during our stay, we waited to pick it up the next morning to avoid the high self-parking rate.A group was having trouble checking in--another Priceline customer who had 4 people in their party and all that was available was 1-King rooms. Not the Hilton's fault. Priceline only assures room for 2 adults. So I tried out the self check-in terminal and entered my Hilton Honors number etc., but it could not print out keys. A second clerk appeared behind the desk just as I finished, so he made the keys. Because of Honors, given room facing interior courtyard and renovated.Bed very comfortable. Room fine. Toiletries nice. View of Mt Rainier next morning.Another line at desk the next morning, so I used the terminal to check out and dropped keys in box. Fruit available to snack on and a coffee stand with scones, etc. open, but we went to Dennys down the road for breakfast.A staff member was working hard to ensure everyone who needed to get to the airport was moving along, counting folks to fill a shuttle, getting ready for the next one. Would stay again if could get Priceline rate, but factor in cost of parking. Seattle hotels are so expensive!

Great lobby lounge; open where you can see all that is going on. Got in late so just had a glass of wine, I will have dinner next trip.Staff told us a bit more than necessary; people did not show up for work and did not call. I had a problem getting change on Sunday morning all cashiers were out , where is the mgmt or supervisors for cash? Staff was friendly and accommodating to our requests. This is my new location for SeaTac stays.

<Content>Nice Hotel We managed to find a hotel in the Seattle area when driving thru. Seeems like most hotels were booked in the Seattle area last week. Didn't think the Hilton had any rooms but they had 2 left. The rooms are nice and clean. Parking was expensive at $18/night for self parking. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice. I would stay here again.

<Content>Great for Business Stay I was recently in town for business and stayed at the Doubletree at the airport for one night and the Hilton for the second night. I found the Hilton to be a much better hotel for the business traveler. The beds were more comfortable, the rooms were quieter, and the room service food was above-average. While this Hilton was overall not as nice as other Hilton properties (no Executive Lounge/Floor and the look and feel more akin to a Marriott Courtyard), it was much newer and cleaner than the majority of airport hotels I've encountered. I can't speak to the parking garage situation since I left my car with valet and had no problems. I should note that the difference in price between valet and self park was minimal.If you're in town for business, this is a solid choice for an airport hotel.

<Content>Substandard We booked the Hilton with a special company rate and cause of the proximity to the airport, but all other Hotels situated in the Seatac area are also very close to SEA and offer free, quick and frequently running Vans. It was necessary to order the Hilton Van two times by phone, so there was no advantage by proximity to the airport. They have three Vans, two of them parked in front of the hotel without moving during three days, so you have to wait up to 30 minutes for the next ride back to the airport. The Hilton itself has very long hallways only two elevators at the front desk, another one is a half mile away. We've had a clean kingroom with a good mattress, but small-sized bathroom. Our first Hotel in the U.S. without fridge therefor a lot of additional fees: breakfast 18$, Parking 24$ valet or 18$ for good hikers and Internet 10$. So take the straight nighboring public and safe parking for 12$ and the WiFi from the nighboring Clarion for free. Alternative plan, avoid the Hiltion

<Content>Some minor things to complain, but still a good airport hotel At the airport we were lucky that the shuttle bus drove by just when we arrived, so we didn鈥檛 had to wait at all. (That was shortly after we realized why we didn鈥檛 like Seattle airport on our former visit, al that hassle going up, use a skywalk, going down, no good signs etc.) It was a short drive to the hotel. Check-in went smooth, but somewhat unfriendly. We also didn鈥檛 get an upgrade for our Diamond HHonors membership, slightly disappointing. Our room was a standard King with an easy chair with ottoman, working desk with chair and a good quality King bed. Remarkable was that the closet where we thought would be a minibar was locked, so there was no refrigerator available. The coffee set produced great coffee. The bathroom was clean. There were two free bottles of water and some chocolates in our room.Our room had a view on the inner courtyard, a lovely green area and very quiet. When we were just in our room we could hear noise from other people (mostly children) in the hall, passing our room. We were worried, also because we were very tired after our flights from Europe, but we didn鈥檛 hear anything later in the evening and had a good night sleep.The breakfast the next morning was outstanding, there were many items to choose from (even very good red salmon) and a cook to prepare the eggs and so on. We only found the waitresses not too friendly; one even picked our breakfast vouchers without saying anything and looking distressed because we wouldn鈥檛 pay for it. There was no need, as we always leave a good tip on the table when we have a free breakfast with vouchers. When we left the doorman was very forthcoming, the friendliest person we met during our stay. We didn鈥檛 have to wait long before the shuttle bus drove us to the car rentals at the airport. Although some things were not too optimal, we would have no hesitation to make a reservation in this hotel again the next time.

<Content>Really nice hotel! We stayed at the Airport Hilton for the final night of our trip to Seattle. We had hoped to continue our stay downtown, but the hotel for the conference we had attended was not available. I am really glad it worked out this way! The airport Hilton is a lovely hotel and appears to have been recently remodeled. The room was very large and comfortable. Food from room service was great. Most notable for this hotel is the beautiful courtyard. Staying at this hotel near the airport also made catching a morning flight stress free - just a quick ride over in the hotel van.

<Content>Cheap Hilton Got a good deal on Priceline and so had an okay stay for 2 days. Nice rooms but poor housekeeping - they didn't clean the coffee maker or replenish the coffee supplies/coffee mugs. Beds were very comfortable. There were absolutely no extras - as everyone else has mentioned, they charge the earth for everything other than your bed. Parking is ridiculously expensive but you can park streetside on some of the back streets and come in through the back entrance. Free airport shuttle was convenient though.

<Content>Quality OK but food  This hotel is appropriate for business travelers who want to stay by the airport. The Qualtiy of the room was fine but the restaurant costs are very high and it costs $22 to park. We booked the room through hotwire to try to save a few bucks and got stuck here (we did not have to stay by the airport). I have learned my lesson about hotwire.

<Content>Good airport location This hotel is certainly convenient to the airport, with very efficient shuttle service. I stayed here because I had an early departure the next morning.The hotel was just okay. The rooms are quite large, but in need of some upgrading. We had a coffee maker in the room, but no coffee. We had notepaper, but no pens. The air conditioner rattled all night. I asked to be moved to another room, but was told nothing else was available. I did manage to get some coffee and a pen. The worst experience was dinner at Spencers. It was terrible! Salad with brown lettuce was served first. Then came my rib eye steak on a plate the size of a dessert plate. There was no room to even cut it. . . which you needed as it was so tough. You would think for that price they could put a little garnish on the plate. We also had the salmon, which tasted like it had been in the oven too long. It also wasn't very pleasant to be served by a waiter in a white jacket what was filthy! Dinner for two without any drinks was over $100.00 and certainly not worth it. I would definitely not go back.

<Content>Very Convenient if you need to catch an early flight I stayed at the Seattle Airport Hilton twice within a 10 day period in February on my way to and from Hawaii. Since I live in Spokane, Washignton, I did not want to start my vacation by getting up at 2:00 in the morning to catch a 5:00am flight from Spokane to Seattle and then take a 9:00 flight to Hawaii. On the way back, the flights from Hawaii to Seattle get in after 10:00pm making it challenging (but not impossible) to make a connection back to Spokane. I think that this was a good choice to make and I would definitley do this again. The accomodations were very good and the staff (with one exception) was excellent. An on-demand free shuttle to and from the airport is another highlight. The hotel is almost across the street from the airport. It can be a little noisy but that's to be expected at an airport hotel. I would caution anyone who has never landed at Sea-tac airport that the courtesy shuttles are all in the parking garage. It is necessary to take a skywalk and an elevator to the shuttle area. If you have a lot of baggage definitely rent a cart in the baggage claim area. On my first stay, the shuttle driver was very attentive and friendly and offerred to take my bags up to my room upon check-in. The shuttle drivers take turns and also serve as bellhops. This was very welcome to me because I have been recovering from surgery. However, on my second stay, I did not receive as nice a welcome either from the shuttle driver or the front desk staff. I did arrive around 1030pm and there were other guests checking in at the same time. When I did arrive at the check-in desk, the clerk was apologetic for my wait for the shuttle. This kind of puzzled me because I didn't have much of a wait. It turns out that he thought I was someone else. I was never asked if I needed help to my room. I know I should have asked for assistance but did not which was not good for me physically. It just didn't seem like there was anyone available. Since I am a hilton honors member, I was given an option with my reservation confirmation to order something light through room service in advance. I did so. I inquired about this at the front desk. Without checking at all, the same front desk clerk said that it is the room. This was not the case. It was delivered to me fairly promptly. I do not fault the food service department because I actually arrived earlier than anticipated. However, I felt that the clerk just couldn't be bothered to check. I also called down to the front desk about a problem with one of the room phones in that the speed dials to the desk did not work. The same clerk who had helped me previously answered the phone. He was neither helpful about this situation or very helpful regarding my quesitons about the hotel's business center. I believe that this was most likely a training issue with this individual employee and the not overall service orientaiton for the hotel. All of my other encounters with hotel employees were very postiive. Speaking of food, the hotel restaurant, Spencers is first class. I am familiar with this restaurant since there is also a Spencers at the Doubletree in Spokane. This is not an inexpensive restaurant but the steaks are first class. The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner. I did have breakfast in the restaurant the second time I stayed there. They had a very extensive breakfast buffet for $17. It was excellent. I'm not sure if they offer this buffet every morning.I would definitely stay at this hotel again for similar circumstances. I fly out of Seattle a lot to go to other parts of the country. It is very convenient to break up the trip. Personally, I probably would not stay here if I was spending any length of time in Seattle itself since it can take an hour from the airport to Downtown Seattle when there's a lot of traffic (which in Seattle is most of the time!). It is doable to do this though. This hotel includes meeting spaces which makes it an ideal destination for a conference or a meeting.

I prefer this hotel to the Seattle Airport Marriott.Internet costs $10 a night, which is standard in a good hotel.Others [--]about the extras, they should stay at a cheap motel like the Red Roof.

<Content>All the extras will cost you! Good thing It only cost a base price of $50.00. I say base price due to all the taxes and fees that are added up when you get there. Hope you like walking...super long hallways and the parking garage all the way in the back (you have to pay for that too). For such an high quality hotel I was expecting more. No microwave or fridge? ($4 for bottle water) One cup coffee maker? I drink more than one cup by myself.

<Content>Beware of hidden fees!!! I'll start with the good. The beds were very comfortable. I suppose if you need to be close to the airport its a good location. Other than that my husband and I were very disappointed! We were quoted $69 per night through Hotwire and this hotel cost us over $100 per night with the extra taxes and fees. We didn't even pay for the internet, which was $5 per day. The lowest rate for parking was $18 per day and the parking lot was a ridiculously long walk from the rooms. The property has no queen beds, only double or king, and we were told that the king bedrooms are a premium for a premium price. The staff was pretentious and unhelpful. We travel for a living and have stayed in many, many hotels that don't bear the Hilton name that were much more luxurious and much, much cheaper. Shame on them!

<Content>Questionable Quality This property is wonderful in some ways, but... we had to request maintenance to clean a filthy A/C Heat vent; we found every service required a fee-- parking: $18/$24; pet fee $50; Internet access: $5/day. The interior courtyard was pleasant, even on a cold winter day, but pet litter was left unattended to. Why is there a $50 pet fee if it's not for some clean up? In the room itself, wallpaper is peeling off the wall in the bathroom! Not the Hilton quality we're used to.

<Content>Luxurious but pricey stay at the Hilton I purchased two rooms at the Hilton through the Name your Price option via Priceline for a very good deal. The hotel and staff was second to none, and the beds were some of the most comfortable I have every slept on. Our room looked out to Mount Rainier, which was just spectacular. The location was perfect for commuting to and from the airport and despite the airport being just across the street I never once heard any air traffic. Our biggest negative was all the little tack-ons that this Hilton charged, whether it be for internet, parking, printing. Anything outside of your bed was extra, which was very frustrating considering lower level establishments like Quality Inn or Hampton Inn provide all this for no extra charge. I realize that we paid hundreds less through Priceline and should be happy with what we got for the price, but these charges applied to those travelers who paid the full price as well, so I must rate this as if I paid full price. Overall the hotel was a taste of luxury, and the extras are part of that taste.

<Content>Cozy! Maybe this hotel would have bothered me if we had paid full price or if we had stayed for very long, but as a last-night-of-vacation Priceline bargain, it was perfect. Our room was extremely comfortable with a large bathroom and almost comically cushy bed. The walls are thick and very soundproof, so we didn't hear any hallway or neighbor noise and we had a great view of the courtyard. It was like being in our own little luxury world, with lots of nice extras like high thread-count sheets, great toiletries and soft towels. Ours was a handicapped room, and although I'm not in a wheelchair, I think that someone who is would have an easy time navigating the room and bathroom/walk-in shower. The downside of this place is that they gouge you for parking, meals, internet, bottled water -- anything they can charge you for, they do. (Honestly, if they could install an oxygen meter and charge you for breathing, I'll bet they would!) But, if you've got a sense of humor about paying too much for some things, or if you find it a fun challenge to keep out of the tourist traps, of if you're just here for a brief stay, you'll have a great time at this nice hotel.

<Content>Great beds, friendly staff, awful food, and expensive internet The hotel staff was professional and friendly, and the beds were incredible. However, the food served at my conference was awful, and I was terribly displeased to be in Seattle, surrounded by many hotels, and needing to pay for internet access through the Hilton. I will stay at any of the other hotels with free access next time I need to fly/be at a conference. And, if you do end up paying for internet in hourly increments, you must use them contingously, which is not practical for conference goers.

<Content>Above Average comfort Stayed three nights in May 07 for business booked on Priceline for $55 a night. Bigger room than I had before, very comfortable. Beds are wonderful. Hotel seemed half empty so wasn't noisy at all. Very limited plane or street noise. I really only have two complaints about this hotel. The parking is outrageous at $18 a night, the garage is miles from the front desk and most of the rooms and the fact that they charge a high fee for internet access even if you have your own laptop. I've stayed at much cheaper hotels, even hotels in the Hilton family that offer free Internet access and use of a computer if you don't have one.

<Content>Surprisingly nice for an airport layover We had an overnight layover and selected this site based on other travelers' comments. It's not the Ritz but it is quite pleasant and the service is excellent. The complex is spacious, nice for getting some breathing room after a long flight. The dining room is expensive but the food was of excellent quality and preparation. There is a well-equipped and decent sized workout room and if the weather is cooperative a large, landscaped outdoor pool. The airport shuttle is on demand and only takes a few minutes between points.

<Content>Security Improved Glad to see security has improved compared to the last two stays at this hotel. On this trip - the wing doors that opened to the street were locked and required the room key for access at least twice at 9pm; the pool/jacuzzi gate now required a room key (although the doors to the courtyard / pool area did not). On the other hand - the evening after I checked out I returned and was still able to access the hotel wings, the pool, and the fitness room with the same room key. For kicks I should have checked if it still worked on the room - but I didn't. Overall the stay was quite nice with clean facilities and comfortable rooms - although the room fan was quite loud and annoying and I had to turn it off to get some sleep.

<Content>Pretty good at Priceline rate of $65 plus $17 in taxes/fees (not worth $200) I gave the Hilton a rating of 3 given the rates they charge (over $200/night). For the priceline rate I got, I'd give it a 4.5 or a 5 (in comparison with other hotels which list that rate on their websites)The Hilton airport (right across from the Seattle airport) is rated a 3* and in my experience, is a pretty good hotel for that level (and for the rate we got -$65; the priceline rate for the hotel was much higher, as was the lowest rate on the Hilton web page). The airport shuttle is free and was quick for us, with a great driver who was very helpful with all our luggage. He was also great about answering questions, giving helpful advice, and so on.The hotel was very nice, although the layout was not terrific: there are two different buildings with rooms, and the pool and fitness rooms are in the center of one. To get to them from the other building, you have to walk back through the lobby, past the restaurant, and past the conference rooms. The pool is fairly decent for a hotel pool ( lap swimming would be possible - it's rectangular) although it's probably only about 10-12 yards long); the hottub as well. Towels were provided at the pool. I didn't use the (free) fitness room but there seemed to be a large number of machines as I walked past (didn't look closely so can't comment on quality). The rooms around the pool likely suffer from pool noise, but we were in the other building. I suspect the rooms in the building without the pool get a lot of traffic noise - we were on the backside, away from International Blvd, but the loading dock was outside our window. We left fairly early but there were already a couple of trucks. Other than that, however, noise was non-existent. We were able to pick up free wireless, although it wasn't the Hilton's (they charge). Obviously, any time you use any wireless, you shouldn't be putting in credit card numbers and other sensitive information.The rooms were fine - we didn't get a mini-bar (which we appreciated) but there was a refrigerator. The furnishings seemed pretty new - at least, they didn't look old and dreary. The Hilton's shampoo/conditioner/shower gel were very perfumed which wasn't a plus - I was glad I brought my own (why they think most customers would want such perfumed toiletries is beyond me). The sheets were very nice and soft, with a duvet over the comforter (either down or down-alternative). The rooms weren't overly spacious but were fine, unless someone wanted to hold a business meeting or something (iif we had had a king-size bed (we requested 2 doubles), there might have been a bit more space). Housekeeping was helpful. The Hilton was quick to bring up a suitcase (as soon as the airline delivered it) that the airline had failed to get onto our flight.We paid $65 plus about $17 in extra taxes and fees, which was a decent deal, given that the Motel 6's in the area charge close to that per night. We didn't try the restaurant or the coffee cart. One of the coffee cups in the little coffee maker in the room was obviously not clean (a few coffee drips right on the top edge, so the housekeeper had failed to check it!) but that was the only negative for the room.Parking at the Hilton will set you back $18/night (that may not include about $3 in taxes) but we were able to park at the Clarion right next door for about $7.50 plus almost $3 in taxes (they advertise that they allow airport parking). They do fill up (morning seminars need parking) so get there as early as possible; you do have in-and-out privileges (not sure if you have that at the Hilton) as they give you a card to put on your dashboard; the card is not time stamped so you should have until midnight of the last day you pay for. The Clarion's parking is pretty close and for some rooms, is likely closer than the Hilton's.

<Content>Nifty hotel near Sea Tac airport We have stayed at the Hilton at the Seattle Airport four times, and each has been a very pleasureable experience. The rooms are big, the beds comfy, and the staff is pleasant. They have free coffee in room, dryer, iron/board, and in room PPV movies. The drawbacks are: $18/nt self park and very expensive bar/restaurant. I solidly recommend this hotel to anyone with business south of downtown Seattle.

<Content>Great place to stay This hotel is not only conveniently located, it is also clean and very comfortable. I stayed for two nights for work. I checked in early and got a room facing the airport. Initially, I was concerned about the noise, but I didn't hear a thing all night or even in the morning. Also, the bathroom is updated, clean and actually quite large. Parking was a bit expensive at $18 a day, but it was a nice parking facility that was easy to get to through the conference area. My only 2 complaints are that they charge for internet use in the business center and that the pillows were slightly musty. It may have been the result of a humid day or two because otherwise, the place was very clean. I had breakfast at Spencers and really enjoyed the breakfast buffet. For $15.00 it was certainly worth it. The concierge was very helpful and one gentleman with a beard offered the best advice in terms of downtown parking and attractions. He was kind enough to steer me away from tourist traps as well. A younger fellow was not as helpful and I ended up spending quite a bit for parking. Had I talked to this other gentleman first, I would have saved a bundle. However, everyone at the hotel was kind, professional and very very welcoming. There was super easy access to downtown Seattle from the hotel. I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Basic Hilton - Upcharges Everywhere Booked this room through Priceline for July 2007 stay for about $66 including taxes. The parking price noted in other reviews is true to a point. It is now either $18 for self park or $22 for valet parking. I currently live in a very large city and was shocked by the parking fee. The pay per WiFi is pretty pathetic. Don't touch the Fiji water in the room. It is $4.00. I realize that I paid a small fee for the room, but I did not expect Hilton to take it (I was hoping for a Courtyard by Marriott or something similar). They did not have to accept my price, but they did. And what they provided was pretty substandard for a Hilton. I don't think I have ever stayed in a smaller room. The beds were very comfortable, though.

<Content>no free wi-fi Nice set-up. Walk to the airport. Bid $60 on Priceline for stay in mid-July. Much less than $224 on Hilton website.Problem: No free wi-fi. It's $9.95 per 24 hours. I was disappointed that a fine hotel like Hilton charges, especially when hotels on all sides offer free wireless: Radisson, etc. In sum, however, the hotel was clean and the staff friendly and efficient.

<Content>The best I am an extremely picky person when it comes to Hotels. This Hilton was outstanding. I took my 8 year old for 2 nights of action packed fun in Seattle. We were in the pool less than 1/2 an hour after our International flight arrived. There was a free shuttle to Southcenter Mall where we had a great meal at The Rainforest Cafe. The next morning, we took the $12 return shuttle to Pike Place Market, where we walked to the bus stop for Woodland Park Zoo and paid $2 total to get to the zoo in about 10 minutes. Our transfer let us back on the bus 3 hours later, and we got off the bus at Seattle Center. We did the Space Needle, then took the Monorail into downtown and walked back to our pickup spot for the Shuttle at Pike Place Market back to the Hilton. We hit the pool again, and ordered Round Table Pizza to our room and watched TV before crashing in the amazing beds. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone with kids. There are so many people there on business, that the pool and green space at the Hotel are completely unused. We had the best time, and will return as soon as possible. Anyone complaining about noise - you are in a big city across the street from an International Airport - what do you expect? This Hilton earns top marks for cleanliness, friendliness and amenities.

<Content>Ups and Downs at the Hilton Used Priceline and got 2 rooms for $55 each. Called the hotel two days before we arrived and asked for connecting rooms for our family. Got a King room and 2 Queens connecting. Very clean rooms, but on the noisier freeway side. No problems sleeping though, the beds were so comfortable- down quilts too!Some problems/concerns-$18 parking, pool locked and needed two calls to security to get it unlocked, hot tub cold with no jets,one elevator out of order for more than 24 hours. Some very helpful and respectful front desk people. Wouldn't stay here at the rack rate but for $55 it was fantastic.

<Content>Upcharges everywhere, $$ Parking charge is ridiculous We booked Priceline $58/night and it seemed like a great deal. We did not expect all the upcharges being so far away from downtown. $16 parking was extremely excessive especially when this is a location where land is abundent and cheap. I've paid less in downtown Seattle. $9.95 Internet chage is expected at a full-service hotel, but this hotel did not seem to be full-service. Pool and hot tub were out of service. Nothing is convenient, you have to drive far for good restaurants and amenities. Pros:- Near airport (great if you are catching a flight)- Nice business amenities (if you are there for a conference)- Clean roomsCons:- Very expensive parking- Not convenient location unless you are going to the airport- No pool/hot tub in service, they are being torn up- medicore service

<Content>$$ Parking Surprise We stayed here Feb 2006 for one night. Beware that you have to pay 16 self park or 20 full service. However, if you plan to park your car there after 8 and not move it, you can actually pay a one time overnight fee that is 8 dollars instead of 16.The concierge service amazing. They directed us to one of the best seafood restaurants in town (Saltys) and even gave us $20 off coupon PLUS two free dessert coupons. I found them very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful time. And for a price of $63USD for a room with two double beds on the 2nd floor, I'd say it was most definitely worth it.

<Content>Great Hotel for the Money! This hotel was not my idea but our three year old loved to watch all the planes land and take off! It was free entertainment and she sat in the window for hours! The cost for what you got was very reasonable for Seattle, WA. The beds were wonderful, the service was great and the property overall was very clean and nice for an airport hotel. Only a 15 min. ride south takes you to the Puget Sound in Des Moines where you can have a brunch at Salty's for only $24. We then took a ride to get a better view of Mt. Ranier which was only an hour away. On the last day, we had clear skys and could actually see Mt. Ranier from the hotel. Going into the city of Seattle took having a car and a 30 min. drive, but it was fun to see all the funky buildings, shops, coffee houses and people. I was told you can take the city bus from outside the hotel downtown and a woman friend of mine from Boston did just that...she says it was safe and clean and took only an hour one way. Overall this hotel was great!

<Content>Great Location; Really Poor Value My wife and I are Hilton Diamond HHonors members; we will not stay at this Hilton property again.In its favor, the Sea-Tac Hilton is literally across the street from the airport; it's perhaps a three minute shuttle ride. The room was reasonably large, with clean and comfortable bedding. Check-in took less than one minute as we had checked in online and already had our room assigned.Now for the negatives. I have never, in more than 20 years traveling and staying at Hiltons around the world, experienced a bathroom as small as the one that was part of our room. The bathroom could not have measured more than 4 feet by 8 feet; it was for sure a one-person-occupancy setup. Only after checking in were we told that there would be no hot water from 11pm through 4am the next morning, which was interested since we had to make a 6am flight in the morning (we managed to squeeze in three minute showers and make it to our flight. Althougfh we didn't plan to use the pool, we were not advised until after we had checked in that the pool and hot tub had been closed since early September.But what really irked us was that this Hilton seems designed to squeeze as much revenue as possible out of guests. Keep in mind that we paid more than US$200 for our room. In addition, the Sea-Tac Hilton charges US$15 for overnight self-parking. The hotel charges US$10 for 24 hours of internet acess. This is the first time I have ever paid for internet acess at any Hilton property. And assuming you have any money left by the time breakfast rolls around the next morning, be prepared to pay almost US$20 for breakfast. Now, these charges may seem tame by New York or London standards, but we're talking Seattle, Washington here. Frankly, we should have (and could have) stayed at the nearby Doubletree, or the Hampton about a mile down the road, or even the Hilton Garden Inn over in Renton. While I will admit that those alternatives would have been less convenient (especially for making an early morning flight) any one of the other options would have cost much, much less in total and have delivered a total product comparable to what we got at the Hilton.Save your money. Shop around for better values before melting your VISA staying at this clip-joint.

<Content>Decent, but not great The place was ok. Nothing great. The hotel is in an area of town that isn't very nice. Pretty rundown. The parking situation is a joke. You pay $16/night to park in a garage. Its cheaper to park next door in the Airport parking lots. I got a room that was next to the lobby and so got stuck with a trek everytime I came back to the hotel. I guess at least I got my exercise in. The internet access costs $10/day. Seems a little steep since most hotels offer it for free. Unfortunately I wasn't able to score a room across from the Holiday Inn like others and use their free wireless. The concierge folks were really nice. I paid $50/night through Priceline and so all in all this wasn't a bad deal.

<Content>Overpriced parking and breakfast. Nice pool. I like this hotel, but the parking is a joke.Valet parking is $20 and the garage is $16.I could have parked at a airport lot for $8 and used the Hilton airport shuttle!The garage was way in the back, but so was our room, so I didn't care. For $4.00 more I chose to do Valet. But there was a line when we left, so parking ourselves would have been faster.The pool was nice and so was the jaccuzi. It was very large and there were plenty of towels. The deepend was 9 feet and the water was warm so that even swimming outside at 9pm was enjoyable.I made the mistake of using the automated check-in and it stuck us with a smoking room. The desk said that if we used the automated system that we were stuck with our choice. Sounds like bullsh*t to me. The smell in the room was not that bad for smoking and the sheets were very clean and smelled nice. The breakfast buffet was ok, but for $15 I expect waffles or french toast. It wasn't worth it. Next time I'll go to Denny's and get a better breakfast for $4.99.Don't let the room pictures fool you. Our room was very small.I got a $139 room on priceline for $85. I have seen people get this room for as little as $45. I'm sure that paying full price would have got me a room by the pool though.Overall it was worth the stay. Just skip the breakfast and just get a latte from the onsite Starbucks.

<Content>4 Stars for the beds but - Watch out for the gotcha fees The hotel staff, lobby and guest rooms should meet any ones expectations. The beds are fantastic. I too have gotten this hotel on a Priceline bid. However, if you bring your own car and do not valet park, it will cost $16 a day. Valet parking is $20 a day. You are also punished because the parking structure is way, way in the back of the property. And one more up charge, Internet access is $9.95 a day. However if you can book a room on the north side of the property you will pick up the free Internet access from the Holiday Inn.

<Content>I'd stay again in a minute Well, for the price I paid! I booked through Priceline for $60 very last minute before a cruise to Alaska. This was to be post-trip 2 nights. I was unable to get anything nicer downtown for a reasonable price, so sacrificed with the airport. Since we planned on a car, it didn't matter so much the location.We were on one of those cruises that was hit with the novovirus (news crews met us at disembarkation) and after a week with one family member ill, and the cramped cabins, it was a blessing to be able to check into the Hilton at 10am in the morning, no mention of Priceline whatsoever. Our room was HUGE! ( I would have hated to stay there PRIOR to the cruise.) Two King size beds made up about half the room, with plenty of room to stretch out. Very clean and reasonably quiet for an airport hotel, although we did hear neighbors one morning. Only downside, was having to pay for internet access and parking. Other than that, I was very happy, and if it weren't for Priceline, would have still been okay to pay $100...over that, I would hope for free parking and internet.

<Content>Update on SeaTac Hilton Because of their increased pricing, I have not stayed at the Hilton since my last review. Kept checking for stay-park-fly deals prior to my departure, but never was able to get one that was reasonable. Ended up trying the SeaTac Sleep Inn. I'm hesitant to even post this, but I think the secret's already out - it's rated #1 on Trip Advisor for good reason - it's a great value. Reasonable pricing, clean, comfortable beds, and friendly customer service. Paid about $125 (incl. tax) for one night stay and 9 days parking! The Hilton is closer to the airport, has more upscale amenities, and runs its shuttle more often, but when we were just crashing for the night before catching our plane, the Sleep Inn was a better choice for us.

Didn't eat or swim there, although walking by the restaurant the smell was fantastic. Room was quite nice. Down side is that it is a ways to walk from the parking garage. Also remember that if you use the quick checkout to keep your room key in order to exit the parking garage.

<Content>If you have to stay near the airport... I'm from the Seattle area, so my first advice is if you're going there to visit, do not stay near the airport. This is one of the worst areas of Seattle and you don't want to spend any significant amount of time here. If you do need to stay near the airport, this is probably one of your better options.I agree with some of the reviews I've read here. The best thing about this place is that the rooms are clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. Aside from that I was disappointed. When checking in the front desk attendant said all they had were rooms with 2 full size beds. After pressing him a bit he said he could put me in a room with a King (which is what I thought I had paid for) for $10 more. Who knows why I need to pressure him to get that information at 9pm on the night of arrival. And about the $10, I would have gladly paid twice that and get the King in the first place without having to go through this unnecessary annoyance.The room service food was dreadful. In fact this is the reason that inspired me to write a review about this place. I had a salad with browning lettuce and an undercooked pizza with slimy, doughy crust. It was embarrassing. One last thing to note is that the soundproofing was poor. The level of noise from the airplanes was acceptable, however noise from my neighbors was not. I felt like I could have taken part in their conversations had I spoken their language. If I had my TV on the same station as them it would have been in surround sound. Anyways, you get the picture.Even with what I've complained about, as I noted earlier it's probably one of your better options if you must stay near the airport. Just don't order room service and hope you get lucky with quiet neighbors. Good luck!

<Content>Priceline Comes Through Again My wife and I stayed three nights while on vacation. Got the room for $45 a night on Priceline. Room and bed was comfortable. Room service was OK -- overpriced like everywhere else. $14 per day parking is steep, but I guess the way I look at, I would have been happy with $59 per night and free parking so it's all the same. Room was quiet despite Airport across the street. Access to downtown Seattle was good--15 minutes or so up I-5. Parking garage is a very far walk from lobby and room elevators. Business centre internet access was 49 cents per minute.

<Content>Nothing special, but about the best option in the area The key to a successful stay near a major urban airport is to keep your expectations low and your tolerance for mediocrity high. We stayed at the Sea-Tac Hilton for four nights in mid-August, 2005 and thought the place was a reasonably good option in the charmless Sea-Tac area. I got the room on Priceline when I bid $45 per night for a three-star place in the Sea-Tac area. With taxes and fees the total came to $55.50 per night, which is very reasonable for a Hilton. This sprawling hotel appears to have carved out a niche as a conference venue as well as being an airport hotel. A conference center is an integral part of the parking garage, and it was full of conferees during two of the four days we stayed there. I thought the parking fee of $14 per night was reasonable, given that I parked the car in a garage. At the nearby Doubletree (which is also a Hilton property) they charge $12 per night to park in an outdoor lot. The hotel itself is nothing special while being nothing dreadful. The airport is literally across the street and I frequently heard somewhat-muffled plane noises. These noises were not terribly loud, but they were certainly noticeable. The rooms are clean and well lit; the beds and linens are comfortable and adequate; the bathrooms are not-too-small and come with OK towels and amenities. The rooms all have high speed Internet access, but the procedure to get online is less than easy. Also, the system (at a cost of $10 per day) requires you to push through several pages of Hilton advertising each time you log on. Surprisingly, the sound insulation is poor. One morning I heard 5 a.m. wake-up calls ringing in rooms on both sides of mine. Then I was treated to toilet and shower noises, along with the sounds of CNN and Fox News coming through the walls. The hotel staff is reasonably cheerful and reasonably efficient with the exception of the staff in the bar and restaurant. The bar/restaurant staff seems to prefer to share urgent hotel gossip to waiting tables. I found the food in Spencer鈥檚 steak restaurant to be merely OK. Mediocrity was the watchword; there was nothing offensive about the food, but there was nothing noteworthy about it, either. A better option is the 13 Coins Restaurant located in an office tower about two blocks south. It is a very easy walk and is worth the effort if you are tired of Spencer鈥檚. If you have wheels, the best dining in the area can be found at Anthony鈥檚 Homeport in the nearby town of Des Moines, which is right on Puget Sound. Drive about 4 blocks south from the Hilton and turn right on 188th St. Follow the signs to Des Moines, which is 2-3 miles to the southwest, and head downhill to the Des Moines waterfront. Every night, Anthony鈥檚 packs in the locals for fine seafood at honest prices. Their Sunday Brunch is a great value, too.

<Content>Wonderful Stay!!!! The only thing that kept me from giving this hotel a 5-star rating was the cost of parking at $14 per day. The staff was excellent, the bathrooms were very good (no soap scum or old shower heads). I did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but there is a Claim Jumper restaurant less than 4 miles away. Since I am from the midwest I had never heard of this place. Excellent DESSERTS!!!!!This Hilton only has two levels and depending on where your room is you may have a long haul to your room from the parking lot. Having said that, this Hilton is still worth it.

<Content>Avoid the restaurant I surprised my husband with a night there even though we live 10 minutes away. When the front desk found out, I had complimentary chilled champagne in my room by the time I got there from the parking garage (it's a long, long walk so it takes a while.) We also got switched from our super-discounted room to a room with a great view of the courtyard.The restaurant--terrible. I would expect for a $30 filet mignon they would at least decorate the plate a little. It was a chunk of burnt meat on a totally empty plate. I didn't even want to take it home to the dogs.Great place to stay; go elsewhere to eat.

<Content>Outstanding Luxurious accommodations including a huge room with an extraordinarily comfortable mattress and pillows. The bathroom was incredible with a jacuzzi tub, seperate shower, 2 vanities, and plush robes all done in granite and marble. Great location if you're flying into Seattle and plan on visiting Mt. Ranier.

<Content>Great spot before early flight Spent a Saturday night here before an early morning flight on Sunday. Check in was a breeze - room was fine - 24-hour on request shuttle to airport - nice bar - overall it was a great spot considering some of the other lodging options on the Sea-Tac strip.

<Content>Good experience Hilton SEATAC Spent a Saturday night at the Hilton Seattle Airport before embarking on a cruise from Seattle. Stayed on the Hilton Honors floor. The room was very clean, nicely decorated, the beds were very comfortable and it had a nice bathroom. Only downside to the room was that it was a little small with the two double beds. Used the complimentary shuttle from the airport and it was timely. Hotel staff was very helpful. Breakfast buffet was average. Got the room for $94 with the AARP discount. Overall a nice hotel at a great price.
