<Content>Good Value - But don't expect too much! We've stayed at the Bishop a number of times this year the latest being December this year. Located on Robinson road near to the escalator and just above Soho  LKF, the Bishop is very conveniently located to Central Hong Kong. It's currently under a well deserved renovation but if your out during the day, this shouldn't affect you too much. Like all Hong Kong hotels, the rooms are pretty small. We usually booked a suite which for the extra money was well worth it as we ended up with a separate lounge room and bedroom. It's not much to rave about but it's comfortable, clean, conveniently located and in comparison to other hotels in HK, pretty reasonable on the pocket!!!

<Content>Good valua but beware The hotel is in a great location at the top of the escalators and is good value for your money in Hong Kong. However, the receptionist desk staff are hard to communicate with. We had to cancel our last night (due to airport problems in Bangkok we had to change flights and plans), but trying tospeak to the staff about this was very difficult. We had to insist on talking to a manager as we kept being told no to getting our money back for our cancelled night (minus deposit). We were told a manager did not work on Mondays so my husband had to raise his voice to ask for a manager, then one suddenly appeared and helped us sort out the problem.On our second night we came back to our two rooms (on same floor but different sides of building) to discover that our soft comfortable beds had been replaced with hard smaller beds. Once again we had problems getting a manager to sort out the problem and to get an explanation. They told us that one of the beds had a stain so they changed all the beds?????? Not sure why really. Absurd!Otherwise rooms are clean and well maintained and serviced.

<Content>Good Budget Hotel; Can Work on Customer Service My husband and I stayed here one night based on a friend's recommendation for a budget hotel in a good location. The hotel is situated in a very accessible location from the airport (subway and quick taxi ride) and to all the shopping/food/nightlife. However, I thought this hotel could use a little better customer service, especially at the front desk. I know it may be a budget hotel, but it doesn't excuse poor service (see below for specifics).PROS1. Great location2. Good price, relative to other hotels in Hong Kong3. CleanCONS1. Front desk customer service - The front desk folks in the evening hardly looked up from their computers when we checked in and asked questions. The front desk folks in the daytime actually cared to look up at us, but were quite rude and gave us an unnecessarily hard time when we tried to confirm our previously requested late check-out. In the end, the front desk people from the evening and day shifts miscommunicated our request. However, we received no apology. Just a reluctant agreement to let us check out an hour later. Kind of left a sour taste in our mouth. 2. Construction - Don't know how long they're working on the hotel, but they didn't seem to care that they had guests in the rooms adjacent to the construction site. We heard drilling all day, starting bright and early in the morn. 3. Tiny rooms - But it's Hong Kong and you get what you pay for right? At least it's clean. Aside from these 3 cons, 2 of which might be isolated incidents, the hotel is a good bang for your buck. I may look into coming here again if I want to stay around this location.

<Content>your best bet for civilized budget accommodation in HK I'm in HK 6-7 times a year on business, and always stay at the BL (and have done for more than 4 years now, as have most of my work colleagues). The hotel is renovating their rooms which prompted this review. The rooms are small, Tokyo-sized, but clean and fairly well-maintained. The staff are professional and polite. The location is in the mid-levels, a residential neighbourhood, but only a 5 minute cab ride (or free shuttle) from the business area, or a 15 minute walk up or down the mid-levels escalator (a string of connected escalators that take you from office-land to sort-of-suburbia). The room rate is a fraction of the big-name hotels in town - not quite hostel-cheap, but very affordable. The internet is free and fast, and the beds are comfortable with good duvets. There's a kettle and cups in the room (a must-have as far as I'm concerned).If you get a harbour-view room (you'll have to pay a bit more, BL's not that generous on upgrades 'cos they're usually full) the view over Central towards Kowloon is stunning. The renovated rooms, apart from having a fresh makeover, have bigger showerheads, shaving mirrors, small flat-screen TVs, and bigger beds (not much of an advantage as the rooms are no bigger, obviously, so there's less space for your luggage!)What do you give up for the price? Breakfast is average and you're better off grabbing something on the go outside the hotel. The pool is a dipping pond, no point actually trying to swim, and the gym is token. There are no bathrooms, only shower rooms. And you occasionally find the modest-sized lobby crammed full of mainland Chinese tour groups.But given that, in HK, you're likely to be out and about 18 hours a day, and all you really need is a smile, a room, and a bed, BL scores very highly for value for money.

<Content>just so-so I was looking for an affordable base of operations in central/western Hong Kong island. Hotel was fine. I stayed in a single room, paid $100/night. Room was small but adequate, bathroom was a decent size. Clean room but bathroom had mold in tile grout and shower flooring was loose. Hot water in shower lasted about five minutes, then would cycle cold for 1 minute then back to hot. Annoying when you are in a hurry in the am. Also, conceierge gave incorrect info re which city bus to take to my destination. Likewise, front desk staff gave me wrong weekend bus schedule (only week day schedule is printed) and I missed bus to train station and had to take a cab. Breakfast was passable but not great. Small gym was nice and staff was friendly in general. Location is quiet, residential and appeared safe. Not a bad experience but I think I can do better for US $20 or $30 more a night.

<Content>Fantastic Value on Hong Kong Island I have stayed at Bishop Lei twice, Dec 07 for 3 nights and Dec 06 for 8 nights. On both occasions the hotel represented fantastic value for money, especially as I obtained a breakfast inclusive rate with Expedia. Note that however you book, an extra 10% service charge will be added to the bill.Rooms 1710 (standard double peak view) and 305 (standard single city view) were both clean and adequately furnished. Room sizes are similar to other Hong Kong hotels and are fine for me (but there again there is only me to fit in the room). Good desk with bright light for working if necessary. One minor draw back 鈥?the mini-safe is too small to fit even the smallest laptop into, however the free wireless broadband works well with speeds of around 500 kbit/sec. TV has good selection of English language tv channels including BBC World  CNN.There is a reasonable breakfast buffet 07:00 to 10:00 with eggs cooked fresh to order, but is a little pricey if not on a BB rate.As others have commented, the location near the top of the mid-levels escalator makes for a more peaceful location than say Kowloon, and the mid-levels plus adjacent soho district contain the majority of Hong Kong鈥檚 western restaurants if Chinese food isn鈥檛 to your taste. If arriving at Hong Kong MRT station from the airport, take exit D 鈥?and then either take a taxi from the rank outside, or cross the road into Exchange Square bus station for the No. 12 (get off at 鈥淩aimondi College鈥?right outside the hotel 鈥?see the Citybus website for a list of bus stops that can be followed ). For a firsthand look at the primates that provide the dawn chorus, the entrance to the botanical gardens is 2 minutes walk from the hotel (turn left out of the hotel, take the path that goes under the road and follow it downhill).There appears to be a programme underway to provide potable water to the rooms by mid 2008, in the meantime distilled water is available in a nearby shop for HKD 15 for 5 litres. I would take care with an earlier reviewer鈥檚 statement that Hong Kong鈥檚 tap water is drinkable; whilst that may be generally the case, the water supplied at Bishop Lei is currently NOT potable.

<Content>The low down on Harbour View Suites... The Harbor View Suite sounds great from other reviews, however after booking online and paying a premium rate, I was offered a room on the 3rd Floor with no harbor view (i.e. no water visible only the backs of the buildings in front of the Hotel). I finally got a room on the 9th floor after a lot of discussion. I could at least see a tiny part of the harbor. My advice is to make sure to secure a room higher up in advance, otherwise its not worth the time and effort of coming up the hill if you don't have a room with a view.The location is a long way back up the hill even by bus or escalator if you need to pop back to the hotel for anything during the day.The location also has its advantages with easy access to Soho, via the mid-level escalators. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel door which links with the MTR. Its not too far to walk to the Peak from here - however none of the staff knew the path to the peak - so we found it ourselves! Free wireless internet in all rooms is excellent.The Elevators are extremely slow in this hotel. Checking-in and checking out is also quite slow.There was renovation work going on in January 2008, so it got noisy from 9am in the mornings. Don鈥檛 plan to work in your room as the noise will drive you crazy.

<Content>Average hotel The plus for this hotel is the location. I got the room with the view of the harbour and it was pretty awesome. Another thing is it is pretty close to the Mid Level escalator, which is very convenient to get to Central. Also the escalator passes many nice cafes and shops as well as Lan Kwai Fong, one of the happening spots of Hong Kong. The hotel is really nicely located as it is not stucked smack bang in the middle of the Hong Kong maddening hustle and bustle but it is close enough. They also provide free shuttle service downtown.The downside is the size of the room - shockingly small!

<Content>Great value and what a view!! If you're not religious, don't let the whole 'Christian Hotel' thing put you off. There was nothing spiritual about the place except for the feeling of being in the clouds when looking out from a harbour view room! We managed to get a harbour view room (an absolutel must!) for HK$810 a night. The rooms are smallish and the hotel doesn't have too much to keep you entertained but you're in Hong Kong...get out and see the sights. Come to think of it, we couldn;t even use the pool because there were severe storm warnings. The customer service was ok but nothing to write home about. Location is great but half way up a mountain, expect to do some walking or use the escalators or a taxi! Nevertheless, great location.

<Content>Super Deal for Hong Kong Island - Harbour view suites a must! I am sitting in a Harbour View Suite #2309 at the Bishop Lei with a panoramic view from both rooms that is amazing. Not only this, but we heard the apes in the zoo this morning, saw an eagle soaring over the botanical gardens below and can watch the star ferries come and go. All of this for $960 HK a night! This has got to be the best deal in HK. If you are here purely to shop, then the midlevels is not for you. But if you want to experience HK, do some touring, shopping and enjoy the restaurants of Soho, this is THE place. We thought we wanted to stay in central and were not willing to pay the price (two adults  one child) for other hotels. We have a two room suite here. Everything is clean and new. Large TV, quiet airconditioning, floor to ceiling windows, crisp white duvets, down pillows and shuttle to take us almost anywhere. We are using the mid level escalators, but I can imagine that in August, it would get tiresome. We used the hotel organized limousine service to get here. Very simple, nice and reasonable. The breakfast buffet this morning was passable for the price ($260 for 3 ) . Hotel has nice exercise facilities, but the pool is closed for maintenance. It is so nice walking along Robinson street, and easy to get to just about anywhere. Very close to the Zoo and Botanical gardens (we can see the animal enclosures below) We booked a non-smoking room, but arrived at 7 a.m. and were offered a smoking room. I checked it (super sensitive to vile cigarettes) and there was no trace of smoking. We were thrilled to have early check in. I love this hotel!

<Content>Tiniest room ever! If walking from Central, the hotel is situated near the top of the mid-level escalators which are fun for the first couple of times but I found them a bit tiresome after a while. However, there are a number of buses which stop outside the hotel and taxis are very cheap.Can't fault the staff - very helpful. The breakfast (included in the price) was fine and included an egg station, cereals, breads and a hot buffet.Had requested a non-smoking room but got a smoking room but not much smell. Couldn't open any of the windows but the biggest qualm was the size of the room. I had booked a double even though I was a solo traveller. The room had space for the double bed, a small desk and a tiny table to open a small suitcase. The wardrobe would have been able to hang up about 3 items. However, the bathroom was OK and adequately stocked and there was free tea and coffee in the room.The other gripe would be the incredibly thin walls. I could hear entire conversations from the room next door and when they started singing at 11.30pm I think everyone would have heard it!Annoying Xmas music playing through the entire hotel including a kids sing Christmas Songs played quite loudly at breakfast!One plus point - free wireless broadband. I guess if I coudn't find anything else I would stay here again and the areas around Shelley Street had lots of good restaurants.

<Content>Unbeatable price for location Stayed for two weeks. Can't find any hotel cheaper than this for its proximity to Central. Love the free shuttle every morning that brings you right to Central/Admiralty. Weird that the hotel doesn't post info on this service on its own website. I'd expected a hostel-like accomodation given the price, so was surprised to find full set of toiletries, coffee/tea making facilities in the suite. The harbour view suite is 280 sq ft, definitely much larger than the 4star hotels I'd stayed in over at Kowloon. Great pillows, sheets and towel quality.Service is at its extreme. Conceige staff are wonderful and helpful. Housekeeping very professional even over the phone to my greatest surprise. The carpet in the suite is always very clean despite its age. Room service speedous. As for reception, only one Joe Yau is a fabulous service staff which great smile; other counter staff tend to be expressionless, impersonal and cold. But efficiency is there. Beware of the swimming pool. Stairway that one wld think lead you to the pool area actually lead you right into a foot washing area on your final step without any warning of no footwear. Very illogical. You have to love the quieter part of HK to like staying in Mid-levels. Not suitable for tourist who like to stay right smack in shopping district and have a restaurant right at your door step. Getting back to hotel is a hassle if you carry loads of shopping harvest, unless you take a cab. Its location along Robinson Rd is known by all cab drivers. The adventurous can take numerous buses available (from Wan Chai, Causeway Bay) to Caine Rd, and take 2min of the Mid-Levels Escalator back to Mosque St and walk 5min to hotel. Along Mosque St, you will pass by a takeaway only Pizza shop that makes amazingly thin crust pizza with great variety. Free delivery available.

<Content>Terrific hotel at affordable price We (party of five - three rooms) stayed three nights at this hotel in September and loved it. It doesn't have big tour groups staying and has a friendly personal touch. We opted for harbour view suites as they weren't much more than the standard rooms and the views were breathtaking, particularly at night. We loved having a seperate sitting room/dining area from the bedroom. The location was great, bus stop outside the door to Central if you didn't feel like walking down the steps. Plenty of taxis passing the hotel and the the escalator back up from Central was terrific - it didn't exist when I lived in Hong Kong 20 years ago. This is the only place I want to stay in Hong Kong when I visit and I highly recommend it.

<Content>Best value in Hong Kong Stayed here again last week - second time in two years - so that says something. Rooms still small but at least I was prepared for it this time.The hotel serves breakfast daily on level 1 - decent food but very over priced. You are better off walking to the mid level escalators and finding a cafe.Love the pool. Great to have a swim with a view of the harbour after a hard and sweaty day treking the mid levels.New smoking laws in HK now which means the hotel staff crack down on anyone smoking in the driveway. But for some strange reason smoking by the pool is deemed okay.

<Content>Tiny Room but great area! My husband and I stayed here during the first part of our trip to HK last year. The hotel itself is very clean, has a friendly English speaking staff, and the location is great for getting a taste of real HK instead of just being in a tourist zone. The room itself was really small though...barely enough room for both of us to be standing up at the same time since our suitcases took up most of the room. If you are looking for a inexpensive hotel and a good area and don't mind small quarters I would really recommend this hotel.

<Content>Bishop Lei: great location and value We stayed at the Bishop Lei this week while in Hong Kong. The hotel has a great location, the rooms are very tiny. Try to upgrade to a suite with a harbor view and it will be well worth it (and its not so much more expensive). The upgrade suite is the size of a regular room in most standard hotels. Our view of the Hong Kong skyline was breath taking! It was so wonderful we slept with our curtains wide open. Floor to ceiling windows! It was a delight to come 鈥渉ome鈥?to that view after a long day of shopping and touring.The room kind of smelled bad/musty until you turned on the air-conditioning. You need the room key to turn on the power, so the smell kind of gets you every time you open the door. After a few minutes though, its fine. The bathrooms are a little Spartan but the shower was hot and had good pressure, the bathrooms and towels were very clean. The elevators were extremely slow. The hotel has a free shuttle to Stanley Market and Hong Kong Central District, just as the concierge for the schedule of which days and what times. This is a nice bonus. For some reason the hotel staff tried to discourage us from taking taxis saying it would take 10-20 minutes to get a cab. However, we never had a single problem and always got a cab within minutes.I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends, because as compared to other Hong Kong prices, the Bishop Lei is a steal.

<Content>Breathtaking view! I was pretty nervous before arriving at this hotel, I saw such widely varying reviews. Since it is very inexpensive for the area, I booked a Deluxe Harbor View Suiteand requested a corner room. WOW!!!!! yes it is rather small, but the floor to ceiling windows in the sitting area and bedroom look out on the most incredibly beautiful perfect Hong Kong view. I got room 1309. SO AMAZING!!Free wireless internet, free breakfast. Room service is basic but they showed up within 5 minutes. The hotel area is very ritzy and so interesting with the walkways, hillside streets, high rises, escalators very close to go down to SoHo or Lan Kwai Fong-- great great location.I looked forward to waking up with that view, and also looked forward to coming back home at night to just sit in bed and gaze out at the lights of hong kong.

<Content>Cool and convenient We loved the Bishop Lei. It was a cool hotel with nice inclusive breakfast and good facilities. The extra touches like evening turn down and spotless room cleaning were excellent. We booked a suite, mindful of the tight space in HK and were not disappointed - it was great. Our friend had a harbour view suite and his bedroom had a 270 degree glass wall overlooking the sweep of the habour - amazing. All the staff were frendly and helpful. True you won't get lots of space in HK but when you see how densely packed the island is, you won't be surprised! It has a great location just off the Mosque St exit of the mid levels escalator, and with cabs plentiful and cheap (under 拢2/$4 US to Star Ferry / Central) it's simple to get around. Not near the MTR (rail) however, but cabs were great. The escalator ferried us safely home from Soho and Lan Kwai Fong after a few beers and we enjoyed another lovely stay in beautiful Hong Kong - thank you all!

Great pool (just the right temp of 26) with great views. All staff were polite and helpfull. As for the rooms they are small but this is a HK issue not solely a Bishop Lei thing.It is also understandable when you see the cost of apartments in this part of the city.

(yeah, not really surprised...)So i showed the manager my printout of confirmation for the room booking (that i have booked 3 months in advance) and pointed out the line  non-smoking room requested. So what was his reply, you might wonder? He told me  That was just a request. we do not have to honour it if it is not availableNot the best service....And yes, the rooms are very, very, very small. my room is so small, there is no space to put my suitcase on the floor!!!!

<Content>Bishop Lei: Good Location to Business District, Tiny Room I stayed about 2 weeks at Bishop Lei in Sep/Oct 2000. This hotel is very well-located if you need to access the business district of Central. Coming from a place where rooms are generally more spacious, I was initially shocked at the smallness of the room. To give you an idea, the wardrobe for hanging clothes can hang all of 3 hangers only. However, I found out that alomost all the properties in that vicinity (Mid Levels) are built very close to one another and the area is very densely populated. Good price if you need to be around that location.

<Content>OK... The Bishop Lei is a fairly decent hotel, reasonable by Hong Kong standards, but overpriced compared to other Asian cities (even Tokyo). It is in a good location near to the lively mid-levels, the room was small but quite adequate and the shower was good. Demerits - absurdly expensive internet access in the 'business centre' (but this is an across the board thing in China it seems); lack of compimentary bottled water despite the tap water not being drinkable; surprise 10% service charge on room rate.

<Content>Exceptional value and service I have stayed at the Bishop Lei twice, most recently in October, 2006. Though the rooms are compact, they are clean, well appointed and exceptional value --and besides, did you travel to Hong Kong to stay inside? Unless you are travelling with kids or in a group, there is plenty of room. Do you really want to pay three times as much just to have 30 extra square feet?Harbour view rooms provide an exceptional view of Central. Watch Hong Kong' s nightly light show from the comfort of your room, the terrace outside the coffee shop or my favourite spot, while you're in the pool! Wireless internet is free in rooms, though there is a charge for internet access in the business centre. The concierge, housekeeping and deskstaff are all helpful. Location is great -- a few minutes walk from the escalators and ess than a half an hour stroll down to the Star Ferry --or hop in a cab for about $30 HKD (luggage is extra) . My only requests would include bathtubs (though the showers are great) and extended hours for the pool which could be open a little earlier and later --especially during the hotter months. I will never stay anywhere else in Hong Kong.

<Content>Great Stay My partner and I stayed here at the end of May. The hotel is up the mountain a bit, but is two blocks from Central-mid-levels escalator, so it was pretty convenient. It's not cheap, but seems like a good deal for Hong Kong -- and for being so accessible Central.The room, bathroom, and sheets were quite clean, though the air smelled a little musty when we arrived. The windows do not open. While we had control over the A/C, it was hard to regulate, so we were often too warm or too cold. The bathroom was fairly small and had a standing shower (no tub.) We did not try the breakfast.It was nice to have a pool, though the pool is not as big as it seems on the Web site.Staff were very accomodating when our flight changed, and we had to come back after checking out.Overall, our stay was comfortable and a good deal, though we might look around for something more special the next time we're in town.

<Content>Price/Location combo make this place unbeatable Let me preface this review by saying that I am a resident of Hong Kong, and in fact own a flat on Robinson Road. During the renovations of our flat, we were frequent guests at the Bishop Lei as it about 2 blocks from our flat. Let me also say that this is not normally the type of hotel I'd consider - I'm ridiculously picky.Having said all of that, I challenge you to find a hotel in Hong Kong that is more conveniently located for the prices they charge. Yes, you have to step outside to change your mind in the small rooms. Yes, they're basic. But they're clean, comfortable, and for $500HKD/night ($65US) you cannot touch it anywhere else in Hong Kong. And besides, if you're doing much more than sleeping in the room, you've missed the point of a visit to Hong Kong.Just one other note to refute a prior review - while it's true that they do not provide bottled water in the rooms, it is in fact untrue that the water isn't potable. Tap water is perfectly safe in Hong Kong.

<Content>Nice but misleading! When we booked we were arranged for a queen sized bed with harbour view. The beds were double and there were no views of the harbour. Having said this, it could have been the agent who was misleading us!The view we had was of the buildings/banks around the harbour so pretty spectacular. The location, near the escalator in the mid levels, was excellent.The shower was excellent! Although we were disappointed to have been misled, the hotel was fine and we would stay again.The only grumble we have is it took them 40 minutes to check us out when there was no-one else in reception.

<Content>Good choice in Hong Kong We stayed at the Bishop Lei for four nights. Agree with the other reviewers that you definitely want a corner room--with bedroom and adjacent sitting area. The view is awesome. There is nothing pretentious about the Bishop Lei and it is a bit out of the way, but if spending more than $200 per night is not your thing, it's a very good choice. Our major complaint is that the water is not potable and they do not provide you with free bottled water. Other than this, we were content there and would return.

<Content>great location, iffy security Location can't be beat, at the top of the escalators. I had a suite on the top floor, on the corner. As other review stated, the bedroom is in a hexagonal shaped room with windows all around, and the view is awesome. Decent bed, teeny closet. Bring your own toiletries. Stall shower had a bit of mold, but good water pressure. Being a single woman on this trip, I must say the security was a bit scary. They don't have computerized keys for the rooms. It is like a housekey, which I fear anyone could get a copy of. There was a note in the room not to leave valuables out because of problems with theft. Yikes. The housekeeper kept reminding me to throw the safety latch when I got inside. The staff was super nice, very helpful. If not for the security issue, I would probably stay again. Very inexpensive for HK Island.
