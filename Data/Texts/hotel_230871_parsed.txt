<Content>Loved the location Was a little unsure after reading the various reviews on trip advisor. The hotel was great, room was a small but very clean but only used this for sleeping as out all day and night.Breakfast area bit tight in the morning but we used upstairs tables so did not have a problem with this.Was looking for a central location for the Xmas Markets and this was ideal, would suggest if anyone going before the Xmas, print off list of markets so you can then travel on the tubes very easily.Just around the corner we found a 24hr bar which was handy!! Would also suggest you go to the Irish Bar as this was very lively.Overall a great location and would go back to this hotel.Would advice comfy shoes due to alot of walking about!!

<Content>Beautiful hotel in a good neighborhood Hotel Air Berlin is an inexpensive hotel near the Tiergarten in the center of Berlin. Location is wonderful; it's very close to several u-bahn stops, as well as some spectacular buildings, sites, and during the holidays, Christmas Markets.I had a single room, and it was the tiniest room I have ever stayed in. I had previously stayed in a hostel in Berlin and my room was much bigger. If you're only there to sleep, it shouldn't be a problem. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. However, there wasn't a trash can in the room; just a tiny one in the bathroom.The decor of the rooms was plain, but the hotel building itself is beautiful. The hallways are exquisite and there is so much detail. The front desk staff was nice. Breakfast is not included in your stay and is, I think, 13 euros.On their web site and on expedia it said wireless was included, but that is false advertisement because while they do offer wireless access, it's through tmobile and you have to pay extra. The only plans offered for access are 8 euros for an hour, or 29 euros for 30 days. I am a student and while traveling in Europe, needed to have access to the internet for more than an hour at a time in order to attend my classes via webcam, so even though I was only at the hotel for one night, I had to spend 29 euros for the 30 day tmobile pass to sit through a 3 hour lecture and then do a lab and a quiz. If the hotel doesn't actually offer this service and the service comes at a much higher cost, they should put that on their site because I honestly wouldn't have stayed here had I known, since I knew I would've been spending 5 or 6 hours using wireless.

<Content>Location couldn't be better After I had booked the Hotel, I had seen some bad reviews on the internet so I had some concerns ! However, these were unfounded as the room was very nice, and clean. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, and the location could not be better for sightseeing and shopping. Highly recommended.

<Content>Adequate My spouse and I stayed at this hotel for five nights in late May, 2008. There are at least two positive things to say about it: location and value. As others have reviewed, it is in a great location - close to Wittenbergplatz where you can find a popular U-Bahn stop, trams and busses. The KaDaWe department store located there is worth a half-day tour. Be sure to check out the food floor.The other positive thing, value, was important to us. Our rate was 104 Euros for one night and 83 Euros for the other four nights. I never did figure out why there was a difference but I knew about it when I reserved the room.Of course, when there is value, there are tradeoffs. Here are some important to us. The room was tiny. The bathroom was cramped. There was no elevator to our room on the first floor (second floor in U.S. terminology). The staff was very young and spoke only broken English. This was not a problem for basic information exchange but they were absolutely no help regarding local attractions or locating other things such as an Internet cafe. (It turns out that there is one two blocks away! Go to the KFC and look across the street.) Our traveling companions said there was no wi-fi for their laptop. The breakfast was nine Euros per person and was not as good as free breakfasts at other places we stayed, so we only ate there one morning. You will not find amenities here that you find at larger hotels. Having said all this, I come back to value and location. We consider these to be important so, overall, we were satisfied.I do not know if this hotel has air conditioned rooms so check on this if it's going to be hot when you travel. The ventilation was not great.For breakfast, try the coffee shop diagonally across Wittenbergplatz. I can't remember its name but it's the one that sells ice cream as well as coffee, pastries, breakfast, etc.. It's very nice inside. There is also a supermarket on Wittenbergplatz. There is a laundry a few doors from the hotel.

<Content>Location is main selling point The location of this hotel was fantastic and probably worth staying for that reason alone. The price for this location compared well with others in the area.The staff very friendly and efficient I have to say. And the whole hotel was very very clean.On the downside, room was tiny, and I mean tiny. Ours was meant to be superior but we spent the whole stay wondering what we got for the extra 10.00 per night. It seemed exactly the same as our friends' standard room! Bathroom was spacious however and again, very clean. Breakfast was the main problem for us, not the food, that was ok, just the amount of space for so many guests. There were only 10 tables for whole hotel and so we had to eat very late (10.00) on both days due to not having anywhere to sit.This hotel really is no frills. Its a good price for somewhere to lay your head right on hand for the K'u Dam etc.I would recommend it with all of that in mind.

<Content>Don麓t expect a good holiday We were four persons staying at the hotel for two nights. We had booked well in advance, about 45 days before arrival and one couple got a fairly spacious room on the third floor, whereas the other two got a horrible little room on the first floor. The room plan was very strange with a narrow corridor holding a desk and a chair and then you had to turn right 180 degrees to find another narrow space with two beds. The only good thing to say about this arrrangement was that the beds were comfortable and wide. The bathroom in the first narrow corridor of the room was also good. The worst thing was a window without any curtains in the first corridor of the room.. When you stepped into or out of the bathroom EVERYBODY across the yard could watch you. Imagine the feeling if you had taken a shower and were undressed! This we pointed out to the receptionist but to no avail. Finally we had to cover up the window with one of the bath towels to get some privacy. Unprofessional staff-warning! Stay out of this hotel if you want to enjoy your holiday.

<Content>Disappointed I booked a single room for 3 nights through [----] and got a good rate however I was very disappointed with this hotel. The first single room they put me in was slightly larger then a broom closet and the cleanliness was not up to the usually excellent German standard as there were hairs on the bathroom floor. I would have been able to get used to the small space, but what made it unbearable was the smell coming from the bathroom drains which I think must be a sewage problem. I had to sleep with the window open all night. (I went in Feb so it was cold!) The next day I asked the manager to be moved to a different room and she said all they had was another single, the same size. I offered to pay more for a better room but she said there weren't any other rooms. The single room she gave me was again very small but thankfully the bathroom did not have the strange sewage smell. However, it was a smoking room. (I had specifically asked for a non-smoking room when I booked) So, my choice was smoke or sewage smell!I chose the smoking room and had to sleep with the window open. (again)The manager could have easily fixed this situation but chose not to. (there WERE other rooms available, I had a friend ring them and she said there were doubles) Because I had paid a low price for the room she was not willing to help.Despite all this I had a wonderful time in Berlin but I would not use this hotel again.

<Content>Average hotel with prime location I found the hotel to be typical of its rating. No big surprises. The best thing about this hotel IS the location. It is only 1/2 a block away from a main street, subway stop, and the KaDeWe department store, but it is quiet. Yes the breakfast is typical rolls, cheese, and meats but then again, with KaDeWe and its prime selection of foods, just let this hotel be your appetizer for bigger and better things. the room I stayed in was small compared to American hotel rooms. However, this IS Europe. Most are small according to American tastes, and therefore I was very happy with it. It was cozy and inviting overall, including the staff.

<Content>Lovely hotel I felt this hotel was a really good place to stay. Its in an excellent location, really near the (Alexanderplatz?) metro station but remarkably quiet too. We found this a really good place to explore Berlin from, as it was so easy to get about. Plus the local area seemed very pleasant, with restaurants and bars not too far away. There was also a huge department store called Ka Da We about 5 minutes down the road and a cheap supermarket about 2 minutes walk away which was really useful for getting supplies.The hotel itself is in a really interesting building, with nice wide corridors and seemingly plenty of rooms, furnished/decorated well. The rooms were nice and clean and of a reasonable size, though I guess it depends what you're used to - For us as a couple it was ideal. Plus, the double glazing blocks out any sound and the beds were fairly large and comfortable, so you'll be sure of a good nights sleep! The breakfast was very pleasant, held in the modern looking bar and reception area downstairs. Admittedly, the reception desk is close by but this wasn't at all unpleasant or disturbing - We had a lovely breakfast every morning for the 5 days of our stay. Staff were all very polite and friendly, willing to answer questions about how to get somewhere or what to see. Price-wise it was just right I think.

<Content>Not as bad as they say, but not as good I was booked into Hotel Air for a conference. They put me in a single room. The single rooms are VERY SMALL (mine was #205). Now, in their defense, I'll say that I got used to the room within a day or so, all I did there was sleep, clean myself and call my spouse back home, and that the bed was comfortable enough. But still, if you are an American used to having some room in your room, the singles will be a bit of a shock.The location is outstanding for getting to the U-bahn and seeing town and there are some good restaurants within walking distance (at least east, south, west). There is an internet cafe one block over but the staff don't appear to know about it.Don't consume the overpriced goodies in the room. There is a kaiser's within a block where you can get what you need. I even took the liberty of emptying the silly stuff they put in the fridge and replacing it with my own water. The maid didn't seem to mind.Breakfast isn't elaborate but it also isn't terrible. I'd call it functional. I certainly thought it was good enough not to go looking somewhere else.For the most part the staff speaks a little English (don't expect too much though) and is polite, but on the night shift they clearly had someone on her first night, who knew no English and couldn't manage the phone to forward calls. It took several tries for my spouse to get through to my room.If I were traveling to Berlin for a vacation, the first thing I'd do is check the reviews here and then I'd probably try another place. If you don't mind small spaces and can get a good rate, then this place is probably worth a look.One last thing. Unless there are ground floor rooms (which I didn't see) this hotel IS NOT handicapped accessible. I took the elevator when I arrived thinking it would save me lugging my bags. It stops inbetween floors and then you have to walk stairs.

<Content>Substandard Have just returned from a weekend stay in the Hotel Air in Berlin. I was under the impression that it was only a 2-star hotel but have since found out it is rated 3-star. Breakfast is of poor standard. All meats served are pre-packed purchased at Lidl as are all other breakfast items, nothing is fresh apart from the rolls. Breakfast service poor. If you are not the first, you are likely to have breakfast on a dirty tablecloth.Hotel is currently undergoing renovation, so early morning wake-up (7 am) by drills, hammers etc. Building dust, scaffolding etc all do not help to make it a nice stay. Not all accommodation meets the standards as shown on the hotel photographs. A lot of it is dated, no hairdryers in bathrooms etc.Hotel breakfast room/bar all dated.Overall, poor standard when comparing with other 3-star accommodation in Berlin and other large European cities.

<Content>nice hotel This is a nice reasonably priced hotel located about 10 minutes from the Zoo station. The hotel is ideally situated for seeing the major sites and it is in a very quiet location just off of the Kurfurstendamm.nearby there is an abundance of major stores, beer gardens, restauraunts and other places to eat.The hotel was very clean and tidy and the rooms were very large, The breakfast area looks as though it has been revamped and has ample seating. The breakfast was more than adequate and very nice. I didn`t find the reception staff overly helpful, but it wouldnt put me off using this hotel again.

<Content>Very Good Location! We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The room was very large, so was the bathroom, and, as often in Germany, really clean and nice. Also, this hotel has the BEST location, in a quiet street just next to Kurfurstendamm. Right next to the hotel there were supermarkets, restaurants, beer gartens, it was exellent! We also found this hotel was really good value, no luxury, but not bad either. Our only complaint is the breakfast, it was a bit boring, and the breakfastroom was really crowded, so we had to wait to be seated every day! But at least the breakfast was included in the price..We would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone, and we would choose this hotel again if we ever go back to Berlin.

<Content>Good value weekend break When we stayed, they did a special weekend rate of 85 euros pp for three nights including breakfast arriving on Friday and leaving on Monday which offered good value for money. We had a spacious and well equipped fourth floor bedroom at the quiet back of the hotel. Only downside is that the breakfast area can get congested at peak times. Good location in a quiet area and convenient for buses and trains. Just 200m from both KaDeWe store and the tourist office in the Europa Centre.

<Content>A great surprise! We stayed at this hotel in November 2004 and it was a great surprise. The room was a triple and in fact it consists of a major double room with a smaller room for the 3rd person. Both rooms had TV and quite spacious. The rate includes breakfast an it was very good. The location was quite good and Berlin have an excellent bus system. Theres a lift in the the open backyard of the building.

<Content>Air in Berlin - good value, great location Modest, comfortable small hotel at a summer special rate of 80 Euro, B  B. We had an excellent ground floor room but didn't see any elevator in the lobby - worth checking. It's a few minutes walk from the 'centre' of west Berlin - Breitscheidplatz, Zoo'garden station and the Kurfurstendamm. Get a No.100 bus from there and see all the major sights, right up to the far end of Unter den Linden and back, for little more than a tenth of the cost of one of the 'guided tour' buses.
