<Content>Loved the breakfast and hospitality room We stayed here for 7 nights then moved to Queen Kapilano for 2 nights as it was booked out for the last 2 nights when we booked.Waikiki Sand killed the other hotel with all the inclusions they gave you. Breakfast was toast, pineapple and yoghurt for me and this was excellent and got you going for the day, it was also free. The hospitality room which had computers to use for free was excellent, never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get a computer, excellent for researching things for the next day, or booking a trip.In room safe again free.Close to all buses that we needed, they were just down the corner, and only 2 blocks at the most to the beach.Would go back to this accomadation every time, would not return to the other one as nothing was included, everything costed you.

<Content>Sketchy Traveled with my husband and 3 teenagers. We stayed here because it was our second trip and we wanted to stay on the cheaper side so we could stay somewhere nice for the last few nights. Not bad until I went outside my room to get ice and a man with 2 prostitutes were hiding around the corner from the ice machine. FUNNY BUSINESS. If you want a cheap room with a decent breakfast and pool, this is it. Luxury and ideal other guests, not this place. Then my kids were on the other side of the hall looking at another building and someone from the building across the street was looking at them through binoculars. CREEPY. There is no such thing as views at this place. You can look at the Ala Wei canal or some of the mountains and thats it. It was a 15-20 minute walk to the beach and the only restaurant around was the one at the hotel which we sat at for 15 minutes and left after recieving no service. I was glad to leave this place and go to the Sheraton Waikiki

<Content>good enough, but not great We found this hotel adequate--clean, etc, but not fantastic. The beds were fairly uncomfortable and the room was very small. We did have a balcony (also very small) and the room had a mini fridge which was nice. For the price, we thought it was acceptable, but we were glad we only stayed there one night. (Later we stayed on the Windward coast, where we had a MUCH nicer place for about the same price.) But I guess if you want an affordable place in Waikiki, this one fits the bill.

<Content>Served its purpose in Waikiki Decent and clean hotel in Waikiki. 2 weeks ago I stayed directly across the road at Aloha Surf Hotel, which is very similar to Waikiki Sand Villa but overall I prefer Aloha Surf.Pros:* Free breakfast, good croissants and they toast bread for you so it saves you time from standing there waiting for the toaster* Internet access in room* Location  value for money* Good business center and cheap printing 10c per pageCons:* Separate beds. Had to pay extra if we wanted a King bed.* Valet parking only. Had to use the valet guy everytime we wanted to take the car out. I prefer self-parking.

The complimentary breakfast was lacking. Rooms are a little worn and could use new carpet and paint.Otherwise friendly, safe and walk to everything.

<Content>Good facility Great deal hotel! Even if you arrive in the hotel before check-in time you can use shower room before you get in your room. There is a kind of customer service room which has shower and high speed internet. You need to get security card in the reception beforehand. Or you can use internet at the bar in front of reception. There is a small pool surrounded and blinded by tree. It's good to sunbathing, not so many customers there.Very nice hotel, I'd love to spend the time there again.

<Content>Great location for the price We stayed here for 7 nights and loved it. We didn't expect too much from the hotel since we paid a very low price for it but it was actually much better than we expected. The staff were very nice and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was very tasty even though it only included doughnuts, (excellent) croissants, toast, coffee, and pineapple juice, butter and jelly. The jacuzzi and pool are quite nice. The pool is only 4ft deep, so it's very nice for children. Another good aspect is that every room has a balcony. And the greatest feature is LOCATION. This hotel is located on Ala Wai Blvd. and Kanepolei Ave. It is only a block away from shops, restaurants, nightclubs, and convenience stores and only about 3 blocks from the beach. For really good and affordable food I recommend Keoni at the corner of Kuhio and Kanepolei Streets for breakfast and the Blue Water Shrimp Co. on Kuhio about 4 blocks west of Kanepolei (please note that this rest. is actually a blue bus. Can't miss it. Don't be fooled by its appearance. The food is actually very good.) One last note, please TIP the maids and the breakfast lady at the hotel, your tour guides, the waiters/waitresses, the guy who brings your chair or umbrellas out to the beach. Please TIP, TIP, TIP. People who work in these industries rely on your tips. So please do not be cheap and TIP.

<Content>High Times in Hawaii For a really great stay of any length in Waikiki try the Sand Villa.The guests are mainly repeat visitors  the locals also take advantage of the bar prices  Happy hour [from 4-7pm daily].Ask for a corner or north facing room for fantastic views from the Ali Wai canal, across the Golf Course to the mountain tops, or from Diamond Head to the Punchbowl. Rooms are basic but clean, with balconies  all facilities including a basic continental b'fast.Staff are just great,  the cross section of local colour you meet in the huge bar/pool area gives you terriffic insights into where you should explore next.

<Content>Adequate This hotel needs some work. The carpet in our room was dirty but the staff kept the room very clean otherwise. We had a twin and double bed so we slept in separate beds. The continental breakfast has a limited selection, mini-donuts, mini-croissants, toast, canned pineapple, coffee or tea. We used the room just to sleep. Don't plan on relaxing and enjoying the sumptuous room. Nice but small lanai/patio. The facilities need considerable maintenance such as replacing the missing tiles around the otherwise very nice shaded pool. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. A fair deal for the money.

<Content>Great value for money The Waikiki Sand Villa is a great budget option located in central Waikiki. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and the lady at the tour desk knows everything you need to know about O'ahu! The hotel is located next to the Ala Wai Canal and featured a nice pool, but still only a 4min walk to the beach. All amenities were nearby, always a short walk away to everything. We booked directly through the hotel website for four nights stay and received a complimentary return hotel transfer and room upgrade to a higher level - our room was spacious, we had two double beds, two balcony's with views over the canal, and was nice and clean. The hotel is very outdated and old, but basically all buildings in Waikiki/Honolulu are old in general, the whole city needs one big refurbishment. Check out the restaurant bar downstairs, they have great drink specials during happy hour and the bartenders are fantastic!

<Content>Great Value! If it weren't for the uncomfortable bed with the thin vinyl covered mattress, I'd give this place a 4.The location and value were great. Right across the street from the canal, and a very short walk (5 min or so) from the beach. There are plenty of amenities very nearby - including a small grocery store, an ABC store, and several restaurants and bars.The room was clean, albiet a bit dingy. The decor could definitely use an update - but, it was perfectly adequate. Some of the highlights for us included:- free internet access (we brought a laptop)- the pool/hottub area- short walk to the beach- price (we only paid around $80/night, plus $8/night for in/out parking - directly from their website)- free breakfast- short walk to the beachThe breakfast isn't anything to write home about - just some mini-doughnuts, mini croissants, canned pinapple, toast, and yogurt. But, it held us over for a bit each morning. We gave the breakfast lady a couple bucks tip each morning, and she didn't seem to mind as much that we were pigging out on the croissants. :)We found the bar downstairs to be quite convenient, with decent food. The fish  chips was pretty good, with a generous portion of fish. They also have a cheap happy hour 2 times a night (4-7PM, and then one later...)

<Content>Nice option for Waikiki, great location My friend booked this hotel and it is a good option for Honolulu. It is in a great location, near Waikiki closer to Ali Wai Canal. Much quieter and the TradeWinds at night are fantastic. Each room had a great balcony. The room size was ok, the bed horrible. We had two beds, one was a twin, the other called a queen but it was smaller than a double. We managed. Great pool and common area with a helpful concierge and friendly staff. Nice bar, which was often packed. The Japanese lady that runs the coffee shop could cut the attitude. In my travels to Honolulu, this was my favorite location, a mere 5 minute walk to Waikiki but without the late night parties. Great, safe option for families and single travelers. It is heavily marketed to Japanese tourists, as many hotels in Hawaii are now.

<Content>It was fine for a budget..... I planned a girl's getaway for my 7 yr old daughter and myself for 4 days. I knew I wanted to save money on the hotel since we planned on spending most of our money on activities and meals. We have stayed here before with my husband, it was fine. It is run down and not the most lovely room, but i love the bar with good, easy food to be had while my daughter is swimming in the pool. The review said they redid it, but it is exactly the same pool as the year before. The staff is the best, the front desk people are just so nice. I found it a bit harder to take the walk back from the busier streets at night with my child and I alone, so wouldn't stay here again with just the 2 of us, but there really were no incidents at all. Some bad points: never clean towels at the pool, awful stained vanity that sagged in the bathroom, louuuud fan in bathroom, vomit stained carpet right by the bed, plastic wrapped mattresses that give you cold sweats all night, we were right near the ice machine and people partied alllll night long and were LOUD in the hallway. Good points: great price, great staff, food, pool. Saved $ for the good stuff.

<Content>I liked it!! I know its been a while since my stay, but i thought id put in my two cents. Ive stayed in several different hotels in Waikiki, and for the price location and amenities I like this one. The other hotels ive stayed at cost more, no breakfast and expensive parking.The rooms were a good size, compared to other hotels. I had a view of the canal, but in the morning its really pretty. Because I always go in November, theres a nice breeze and its not so hot, so I cant say anything about the AC.The staff was great, especially the Valet. They were always asking if we knew how to get to where we wanted to go, and also gave suggestions. Although I didnt use it, they do have a gym. I do plan to stay here again in November, overall its worth it.

<Content>stay away from this hotel stayed at this hotel after booking it on Kayak.com Hotel room was dirty, and there were numerous bugs in the bathroom and in our bed. We stayed a couple years ago and it was okay then but has really gone down hill. The breakfast was horrible and they would not allow us to eat very much. I would recommend staying at the Monarch over this hotel and it is slightly cheaper. At check in the front desk seemed unhappy about something and they lost our reservations. I produced the confirmation number and it took 20 minutes to get check in. Under no circumstances would I stay there again. If you do bring Raid!

<Content>Quiet, central and affordable The location was great - though a couple of streets back from the beach we had fantastic views of the mountains and the canal. Our room was quiet and a bit snug but perfect for what we needed - somewhere to sleep! Do not get too excited but the prospect of breakfast included - stale miniature croissants, pieces of toast and tea/coffeee in styrofoam cups is certainly nothing for this hotel to boast about as a 'Continental Breakfast'. The front desk staff were also quite rude and unhelpful.

<Content>It was just okay I booked the room quite some time ago online via the hotel's website. Since I booked online I got 50% off parking. What would have been $15/daily parking was offered to me at $7.50. That was quite a deal because hotels all around us were offering parking for $15-$25. When we got to the hotel, we found out that self-park was not available and it was all valet parking. $7.50 per day was a steal! The staff were very friendly and helpful. Upon our check in, I thought it was a little odd when they asked that all parties staying at the hotel each show a picture ID. Other hotels need only one ID out of their group but since It was part of the Waikiki Sand Villa's security policy, I didn't mind complying. The hospitality room had up-to-date computers, fast connection, and a copier/fax machine. We were placed in a room overlooking Diamond Head. According to the hotel's room map, we were in a deluxe room. The room was just okay. The beds in the room were a double and a single bed and they were comfortable. The air conditioner was not functioning properly. Since the air conditioner wasn't generating enough cold air to cool the room, we opted to sleep with the sliding door open. In the middle of the night and the early morning hours, we were woken by loud music or shouts from the street below. The carpet was just absolutely filthy and needed to be replaced like three years ago. In my book this property is considered a low-budget hotel. The pros outweight the cons and if you don't mind a filthy carpet and being only a 5-minute walk to the beach, then you should consider staying at this hotel.

<Content>Great Location Just got back from a two week stay at the Waikiki Sand Villa. What a bargain!All the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The pool area was always tidy and lovely and quiet.Yes, the breakfast was nothing to write home about, but it was free and fresh and you could always go down the road to Dennys or IHOP if you fancied the full works.The internet room was excellent. So convenient to check your e-mails or look into trips, though the lady who runs the travel desk in the lobby was more than helpful.The location was fantastic. Just a short walk to the beach and all the razzle dazzle of Waikiki!The only negative was the bar. We decided to eat in there one night, but found that the bar staff could not be dragged away from the locals around the bar. The food was acceptable but not great.Shop around for excursions. We found a round island trip for half the price that Expedia were offering and it was great. We saw everything the other trips were offering and were taken to a great shrimp wagon for lunch.Would definitely go back to the Sand Villa. For the price it is in an excellent location and has everything you need.

<Content>Great Pool The front desk was very nice, a bit hard to understand if you call for directions. I was only there for a day and a half but i wished I could stay longer. The rooms are basic but the views make up for it and it was definitely nice to dip in the very large and clean pool. the towel racks were empty both times I went to the pool, but I brought my own, that was fine. I let it dry on the beautiful balcony. I never saw breakfast, slept in.... and the parking was valet, but they were all great. I read another review where the bartender was not nice and I had the same experience when the locals were in there, I didn't feel welcomed. Hopefully he got a different job.The Japanese little place, I did try, but it was expensive and I really didn't like it. I should have tried the bar food. Just not enough time! I almost stayed somewhere else for this trip but I'm giving it another try because the price is right and the pool really was great.

<Content>inexpensive accomodations We stayed at the Waikiki Sand Villa for two nights while we stopped over in Honolulu before going to Maui. The rooms were clean and quiet. Nothing extravagant but for a place to stay in the center of activity, it did the trick. The pool area was beautiful, we had our continental breakfast there. The breakfast just about held you over until you could go for a real meal. Our only complaint was that one of the two elevators was not working while we were there and the wait sometimes was incredibly long. It was nice to be only two short blocks from the beach and nightlife and the market was equally close. If we ever returned to Honolulu we might stay here again. But we honestly preffered the slower lifestyle on Maui.

<Content>It Was Surprisingly Okay! I admit I was cheaping out on the first week of our trip to Waikiki but the hotel was a pleasant surprise. Sure the rooms (we stayed in a Pualeilani Studio) needed updating (carpet mostly) but overall it served it's purpose. And like many other times stated, how much time do you spend in your room anyways?The pool (area) was very pretty and hotel staff (especially maid service) were wonderful and very helpful. My kids loved the breakfast and I found it very handy that we could go grab some toast, yogurt, pineapple, whatever. If you need bacon and eggs every morning, you won't be happy but there is a Denny's up the block. Loved the free internet access and the cheap valet parking! Don't forget to tip...they sure work hard! We didn't eat at the hotel but they made a mean Lava Flow and a very cheap happy hour.

<Content>Great Value! My daughter  I just got back from 7 days at the Waikiki Sand Villa  we could not have been happier. This hotel had everything we needed. No, it is not a 5 star hotel, but if you just want a clean,safe room to sleep in, this will do the trick! It has a nice pool area with a hot tub  the bar/sports grill was great also(it does get crowded with locals for their great happy hour though). The internet room was great to keep in contact with everyone while we were there. It was definitely better than I expected for the price  if you need to book a tour, use the tour desk in their lobby, it is wonderful. My only complaints were the free breakfast(not much but hey, it is free) and the beds were not the most comfortable. We were very happy over all  all the employees were very helpful. If you book now on the hotels website they will give you free transfers to/from the airport if you stay 4 or more nights. We did take advantage of that. Great location also, only a few blocks from everything!!

<Content>Would stay again I wouldn't say this hotel is above average in looks or amenities, but it is definitely above average for the price.If you are like us and use your hotel room mostly just to sleep, then this hotel is great. It's not fancy, and although the carpeting and some elements of the room are worn, it is very clean. The beds were comfortable and the hotel had all the services we needed (free computer use, in-room fridge, laundry facilities, lovely pool). Breakfast is very basic - croissants, mini donuts, yogurt, pineapple and coffee/juice - but everything is very fresh and was a great way to start the day. The location is fantastic! There was some traffic noise (we were on the 6th floor), but nothing out of the ordinary for a city. The staff was very nice and helpful, and the tour desk was really fantastic.I only have two complaints. One is that I could not find a set of stairs that went to the lobby, so I had to wait for/take the elevator whether I wanted to or not. The second is that we requested three rooms and didn't get any of them in the configuration we requested.I would stay there again, especially for the price.

<Content>Noisy air conditioning on 2nd floor!! We stayed one night in the Sand Villa, in a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool. The room was comfortable. There was a loud rumbling noise, seemingly from something like a big central air conditioner, that continued all night. It was about as loud as a plane during flight -- certainly not unendurable, but not pleasant either.The staff was pleasant and helpful, but because of the noise I would not stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel in central Waikiki We have just got back from staying at this hotel and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with it. The location is great, yes it is not right on the beach but it takes about 5 minutes to walk to it. It is also 1 minute from a supermarket (Food Pantry) and short walks to lots of restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is a little dated and could do with some modern decor in the rooms, but it is clean and has plenty of amenities (a bar, pool, jacuzzi, a sushi bar etc). The rooms themselves were an adequate size with a queen bed and a single (maybe upgrading the beds to doubles would be better though), with a balcony - we were very high up and had great views over the golf course and up to the mountains. The staff were very nice and always helpful. Overall a reasonably priced hotel where I would most definitley stay again, maybe not in December though as we did get quite a few cloudy and rainy days - not that I can blame the hotel for this though.

<Content>Great Hotel, Good Service If you're on a tight budget with some class, I would recommend to stay at the STUDIO hotel rooms at the Sand Villa Hotel. Hotels with kitchens can be a problem anyways so I usually don't pick that criteria especially if I'm going to be out and about all day. Service was great and the people were very nice. I didnt expect so much before getting to the room since it has a 2 star rating. However, I was surprise that we did get a great view, and the room was actually pretty good. We slept comfortably, the bathrooms were fine and clean, and the service was great. Everyone there was friendly to us. So if you're on a tight budget, you're planning to be out most of the day during your stay, and you want to stay in a room equivalent to a holiday inn or something, then pick this place.

<Content>Rodent Rest Stop After a week's stay my family and I were watching TV one evening when suddenly a rat ran across the kitchen floor. The family screamed and scurried up onto they beds while I contacted the desk. They were polite but unsurprised and moved us to another room. No hotel staff so much as came up to help us move or to investigate the situation. All week long some of our food and snacks seemed to be disappearing from the kitchen area but we thought little of it. Now we know why. We had been sleeping in a room frequented by at least one rat that entered through a hole in the wall behind the entertainment center. This experience served to destroy our entire trip and has had a lasting effect on my family. I politely asked for one evening's room compensation but was granted only about $100 - about half a night's rate, which I believe was unfair and added to our disgust as well. The on-duty manager was polite but apparently at the mercy of his superior.I would certainly advise one to find different accommodations. No price is low enough for staying at a rodent rest stop. The entire episode is unfortunate and should never have happened. P.S. Watch for ants in the kitchenette drawers.Disgusted

<Content>it has a good website, and great pool: what more do you need in oahu? waikiki sand villa has an easy to navigate website and a responsive email help desk which was part of the reason i booked a room there. the price was attractive too.the hotel pool was the scene of many late afternoon naps, and not just by me. other guests had cottoned on to this excellent activity. the pool was cold, thank goodness. and was open until nine at night. the cocktail bar in the hotel also had a super cheap happy hour (but they wouldn't let you take glass pool side so you had to drink it out of plastic cups - only a minor downside). the hotel room itself was small but very functional and seemed to have pretty effective air conditioning. we even got a nice view of the canal and golf course. given the concrete build up of waikiki this was an unexpected delight. the free internet in the hospitality room and the free (fairly minimal) breakfasts were a bonus too. everything you need in waikiki is in walking distance, with an abc store all of about twenty paces away.

<Content>Great Holiday at Sand Villa We have just returned from 14 days in Honolulu, staying at the Sand Villas. We cannot fault this hotel, the rooms are clean, the staff friendly. The breakfast is enough to start the day, you can always add fruit/yoghurt if need be. We will stay again when we return for another holiday. Thank you Sand Villas for making our holiday an enjoyable one.

<Content>Great Value, Very Nice Hotel, Clean  I stayed 4 nights recently for a business trip. The hotel is centrally located right on Ala Wai Blvd and Kaiulani Ave--it is next to some older low-rise apartments (NOT crack houses!) and only a 150 yards from Kuhio Ave which is one the main streets of Waikiki.  I had room 1207 which was a standard room on the 12th floor right behind the elevator shaft. The room had a single and queen size bed, and a small desk. The bath was adequate, the carpet was excellent and the room was very clean. The linens were also more than adequate. The furnishings were in very good to excellent condition. There was a Panasonic TV and a nice size refrigerator. The rooms have a small safe with Medeco high security locks (no charge). Overall, I was very pleased with the room.  The only negative for the room was that it was noisy. One reason is no fault of the hotel--Ala Wai Blvd is main street out of Waikiki and Waikiki itself is a densely packed and noisy environment. The other factor is that the elevator shaft was right behind the wall of this room and every time the elevators moved you could hear the noise elevators.  The parking valets were extremely friendly and really hustled. The normal parking rate is $15/day but I got it for $7.50 by making my reservations through AAA. This is cheap parking for Waikiki.  I don't drink so I can't comment on the bar. I did try the fish and chips from the menu, though. It was $8.95 and was excellent. The food prices were very reasonable for Waikiki--I don't know who thought the prices were expensive.  The hotel had a lot of Japanese tourists and caters to this clientele. There is a food service in the lobby that makes bento boxes for the Japanese crowd--I didn't try them but given that the proprietors were from Japan, the bento lunches looked very appetizing and authentic.  The Hospitality room had 6 computers and I used them to check my email and surf the web.  The pool was large and very nice but I did not use it. The continental breakfast was served at poolside from 6:30-9am. This was very basic with coffee, cereal, toast, bagels and donuts and some kind of juice. (There might have been a few other items as well). This was the only disappointing aspect of the hotel.  Overall, the public areas of the hotel were very clean and well maintained and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.  Since the hotel breakfast wasn't appealing, you can walk to several restaurants within 2-5 minutes. There is a great restaurant 150 yards away in the Ohana West Hotel which offers fast and reasonable meals.  Just a half a block away is an ABC Stores--it's like an upscale 7-Eleven and they are everywhere on the islands. The hotel is centrally located and close to the beach or if you are driving, as you exit the hotel you're right on Ala Wai Blvd with takes you out of Waikiki. Best of all the average cost per night for my 4 nights (one weekend night) including tax was only $97!  This hotel wasn't luxurious but it was clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and the price was more than reasonable. I will definitely stay there again when visiting Honolulu.

<Content>Not bad for the money I stayed at this hotel for a week with my fiancee in July of 2005 and it was ok. I know it has been a while but I am on here now looking at our honeymoon destination, The El Dorado Royale, for October and I thought I would write up my review. Let me start with the good things. The best thing about this hotel by far is the pool and bar area. The pool was large and clean and we had a lot of fun. It was rarely overcrowded and we loved it. The drinks at the lobby bar were reasonably priced and the bartenders were very nice, although the appetizers and food you could get at the bar were over priced and not very good. The atmosphere was pretty cool as they had a pool table, juke box, and computers with internet access. It was really nice to sit down for a few cold ones after the 8 hour flight believe me.The rooms were pretty clean and we got a corner room overlooking the canal which was nice. The A/C worked really well but the weather in Hawaii is so mild you almost don't need it at night. When I am on vacation I don't really worry too much about the rooms because I rarely spend a lot of time in them. All I ask is that they are clean and the A/C and/or heat works. Ours also had a TV and a mini fridge which was nice.Now for the not so good. The continental breakfast was a joke. It consisted of some stale bagels and mini muffins. There was cereal one day and some juice but that was about it. The service was not all that great either. When we got there they had us booked into the wrong room and then tried to charge us for the correct room. They were pretty snotty about it until we contacted Travelocity and they got it straightened out. And of course the aforementioned food in the bar which wasn't great.Overall this hotel is a pretty nice place for the money. It is within comfortable walking distance to Waikiki Beach and is kept pretty clean. For the price we paid I don't have any major complaints. If you have never been to Hawaii and are planning to go my advice to you is to go to Maui. There is a lot more to do there. Aloha!

<Content>GREAT place to stay! I just came home from a 10-day stay at the Waikiki Sand Villa Hotel, which was also my first trip to Hawaii. I was looking for a place that was decent, clean, and close to everything, but wasn't going to ruin my budget since I didn't plan to be in the room much anyway--and I was pleased that it more than fit the bill for me!!! The staff was fantastic--so friendly--the spirit of Aloha is alive and well here. Everyone I came into contact with was helpful and kind. The valet parking staff was superb! I hurt my foot while I was there, and four days later, one of the parking guys asked me how it was. I hadn't seen him for 4 days and yet he remembered, even though they were super busy! Getting a maintenance person to come see about my TV only took about 5 minutes--the front desk called back to tell me he was outside the door, and then he knocked and announced himself--safety is a big deal with them. The hotel was kept clean and although I only chose to have maid service every other day, I could have had it every day. They did a great job cleaning and straightening the room.I will say two things: 1) The room carpeting needs replacing. I realize it gets trampled on every day of the year, but it is time for an upgrade. The carpets in the hallways were beautiful, so it's time to do the rooms! And, 2) Their continental breakfast is not quite that...watery OJ, yesterday's pastries, and coffee that was only lukewarm. So, if you need a good breakfast to start the day (like I did, so I could go for hours!), check out the many places that offer a decent-sized breakfast for $2.99 - $4.99. In all fairness, I did leave these comments with them on their little survey sheet. However, overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I would stay there again in a moment. In fact, I wasn't even on the return flight before I was planning my next trip!!! Hawaii is truly paradise come true.

<Content>The Rats come FREE! Absolutely awful. We had ants in the kitchen area, in the drawers and in the cupboards, it was a very musty smelling room as well. The continental breakfast consisted of dry toast, canned pineapple, diluted juice and protein bars. Not exactly a continental breakfast that should be advertised if you ask me. Room service did not come until, some days, after 5:00 in the evening. This became somewhat of a problem when we would come back to the room to make dinner, and the maid still hadn't been there. But what threw this hotel over the edge were the rats. Food was missing from the room the entire week and finally one night, while watching tv, we saw why. There were two large holes in the wall behind the tv cabinet and the rats came out while we were still awake to look for more food. The hotel was much less than accomodating when we asked for some type of compensation, as any person would. They said we had no proof and all they were willing to do was give us half of one nights stay for free. My advice, Stay ANYWHERE else.

<Content>Disappointed to say the least This place was cheap, but it still wasn't worth it. We requested early check-in since we were coming from Japan and we were going to arrive in the early morning. We arrive and the front desk said our room wasn't ready even though we requested early check-in. The front desk said a request is just a request, it doesn't mean you'll get it. She also said no other room was available for us. Then she said told us it cost extra for early check-in, so I asked her if we paid for that, would a room be availible. She checked the computer and amazingly enough, there was a room availible. Imagine that. It's not a problem about paying more, it just the fact that first we weren't told about the extra cost when we booked and then the front desk told us a room wasn't availble when there was at an extra cost. We had to wait 30 min for a room, so we went to the breakfast. Which was very dissapointing. It consisted of bagel chunks, small powdered donuts and fruit juice. There was also a tip jar for the person working the toaster, as if you didn't tip, he wouldn't get paid for the task of toasting bread.The room was pretty run down and the bathroom had mildew and a terrible paint job. The location was pretty decent. We should have paid more to stay at a nicer place.

<Content>Truly Home Away from Home This is one of the best deals in Waikiki. It is a few blocks from the beach, has some of the best staff I have ever encountered, and the Price is Right! I was there alone without my 3 kids - and it was so welcoming, so relaxing, and so helpful. I always felt cared for and welcomed 100%. I recommend it highly and will definitely return! Thank you Waikiki Sand Villa Hotel!

<Content>Great Value, Great Pool! We are a couple with a 2yr old from Australia stopping over in Honolulu on our way to the US. This was one of the cheapest hotels I could find when booking  we were more than happy with our choice. Rooms were basic but clean, hotel was centrally located although away from the beach (easy walk down to beach). There was a small bar area with internet access. Were were given access to our room a couple of hours early. Hospitality room was fantastic, offering male female bathroom with shower (exactly the same as offered in rooms); we used this to freshen up having checked out early for a late onward evening flight. Best part of the hotel is the POOL which was great for a budget property. It was of a good size, intimate and comfortable to use, not overcrowded. Our 2yr old loved it! No baby pool but was not a problem. We absolutely loved the pool and would return on this basis alone. We highly recommend this property for travellers on a budget; was GREAT VALUE  can't wait to go back.

<Content>Affordable hotel with good amenities We stayed at the Sand Villa for the last day of our trip. This is a no-nonsense hotel -- it is about 3 or 4 blocks from the beach (but very close to the Ala Wai Canal), so there is no ocean view; the rooms are not fancy, but generally clean and tidy. We paid $100 plus tax for one night, which is about half the price we paid for another hotel in Waikiki.A continental breakfast is included, as is free internet access in the room (the much more expensive hotel charges $10 a day for internet access!). The staff is friendly and courteous. On top of all this, they have a hospitality center which has computers with internet access, massage chairs, and showers! It being our last day and we had a late flight, we used the hospitality center to take a shower, rest, pack and check flight info, etc. I greatly appreciate their providing this free service.I think this is a great place to stay at -- everything is so expensive in Hawaii, if you can save some funds by staying at a relatively affordable hotel which is clean and safe like the Sand Villa, you can free up some funds to do a lot more other things. I would give a 4-star for the hotel itself, but because of the hospitality center, I am giving it a 5-star!

<Content>Great experience My partner and I stayed at Waikiki Sand Villa for four days after a cruise. We were happily surprised; the room was large, we had a good size 'fridge and coffeemaker. The bathroom was huge, with a hair dryer and tropical shampoos and soaps. The beds were fantastic! The mattress must have been new, because they were so comfortable. We had two balconies, with great views of the mountains, the Ali Wai Canal, where we watched outrigger canoe teams practice. The location was excellent; we were close to ABC store, Smorgy's, Keo's, and Food Pantry.The staff was very friendly and helpful, valet parking was effieient.The pool was great, and so was the hot tub. The landscaping was outstanding.Even tho' its rated at '2 stars', I give it 3 stars for Waikiki. The room was $88 a night and that included taxes.

<Content>Great Amenities, Would Return The two best things about this hotel are the pool and the location. We spent a lot of time out by the pool, including before check-in and after check-out. They have a hospitality room, with free computers, full bathrooms, and massage chair where you can hang out and change your clothes before and after your stay. They were pretty strict on the check-in time, but between storing the luggage with the concierge, the pool, and the hospitality room, it was no big deal. The two worst things about the hotel were the condition of the carpets in the rooms and the fact that you have to use valet parking. The carpets were very threadbare and stained. The valet parking would have been very convenient, except that we had errands to run 4 or 5 times during our one day stay, so it was a bit of a pain. The flip side is that we didn't have to try to squeeze a full-size car into tiny parking spots. The parking was $15.50/day. The rooms are about what I expect in a Waikiki economy hotel...smallish with cheaper beds. We had a sleeps-three room with a double bed and a twin. It was a corner room, so the balcony went around both sides of the corner.

<Content>Good Value For the price, an excellent place to stay. Location is great, close enough to everything. A few blocks to the beach. The Ala Wai is great for morning runs and you can jog to diamond head on a nice street.Hotel is clean, pool and workout room if you need it. Rooms are above average - not the luxury, but clean. Balcony is a plus, in -room internet sevice, smallish bathroom, quiet air conditioning, no microwave. (A lot of hotels in this range have noisy AC units!). What did I least like? small bathroom, did not have a queen or king bed available, really limited continental breakfast, valet parking. We would prefer self park. Breakfast in the morning is minimal, but what can I say since we took advantage of it everyday! I usually see which hotel is offering the best deal at the time I book. That said, if the rate is comparable, I would book there again!

When iasked if we could get a room earlier than the recommend 3pm as it was 8 am around 7 hours away Ross was fantastic and i had a room within 15 min.The room itself was more than adiqute with a nice view of the mountians and 2 double beds.....The only real problem that i found was the traffic noise but as i was there for 2 nights it didnt bother us too much.The best thing about this place was the Bar... A fully stocked for the size of the palce and the bar staff were great getting more more that amppley pissed......If you are reading this and you are from the hotel Thnk you for a good few days......

<Content>Value for money I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend for 1 week. We were travelling the USA for 3 weeks and this was our last stop so we were looking for a 'cheaper' hotel to stay in. We found our stay very relaxing. The location is near to the canal and only a 5 minute stroll to waikikki beach. The staff were very helpful and booked our dolphin excursion and airport transfers for us. I agree with most people that the carpet does need changing it's a bit dated but still seemed to be clean. The pool area and hot tub was lovely and never too busy. I would recommend the Sand Villa for a short stay max 1 week or for low budget travellers who are not looking for 5* luxury.

<Content>mixed feeelings The room was quite what I was expecting, some furniture were too big, and the rest were small. The conceriege(sp) gal made various mistakes on my tours i reserved, some where never booked when I got to the tour ticket stations. The breakfast could be better and healthier. The guys who helped us get shuttle service gave us wrong time for pick ups hence we never got to some tours. When I asked the front desk for a microwave to use they told me to look on some floors. Liked the balcony, the housekeepers spoke English (the mainland housekeepers say no speak english) and were very nice and helpful. The desk and the guys up front should take lessons from them in customer service.

Everything was great, employees friendly  helpful, good food from the bar, nice continental breakfast and close to stores  restaurants. The only thing I would say is the carpets in the rooms need replacing badly!!We would certainly go back again.

<Content>Budget hotel with many amenities The hotel is full of amenities, providing much more value than other comparably priced hotels. The staff are great, the location is great (close to the Food Pantry supermarket) and there is free wired in-room internet (wireless at the pool). We were happy that we were upgraded to the seventh floor with a better view.The only let down was that the walls are somewhat not sound absorbent, and we were constantly woken up by rowdy neighbors next door who thought it was OK to scream and laugh loudly at 3:00 AM every morning when they got in. A quick call to the front desk solved the problem, but it would have been nice not to have to have been bothered in the first place.All in all, great value and I would stay there again.

<Content>Great value, good location I think this hotel is a great deal, especially for Waikiki. The rooms were very clean, they have refrigerators and coffee makers, free continental breakfast and free internet. The management and front desk are very friendly. Our first room had a beautiful view and was very clean and in good condition, but because the wall of windows got the morning sun, the room was hot. So they upgraded us to a lovely corner room overlooking this waterway with a great view. No hassels. This is not a 4 star hotel, but then, it had one of the lowest prices on the internet. The location is about 2 blocks from the ocean, in the middle of the shopping area and has a nice pool/patio/hot tub area. I would definitely recommend it for the budget conscious traveler.

<Content>Very Pleased We were very pleased with this hotel. We needed a place to stay in Waikiki for only one night on our way home from Kauai. We asked them for a nice room as it was the last night of our honeymoon. Well, they certainly did accommodate our request. They gave us a beautiful corner suite with a gorgeous view. The staff was very pleasant and the room was clean. Check out time was noon and our flight didn't leave until after midnight so the hotel let us use their hospitality room. After our morning check-out they stored all of our bags for us in a locked room. A couple of times during the day we came back for a change of clothes and shower in the hospitality room. There is a television and computers with internet access in there. It was wonderful to have use of that room for the day. Considering that we paid less that $70 for the night, we're very pleased.

<Content>Okay Based on what I paid (about $70/night), this was good value in Waikiki. The room was rather small and for some reason I found it a bit depressing. Nothing wrong with it though. It was clean and relatively quiet. The air conditioning was a bit weak. Overall, not a bad value with $9.50 onsite parking being another plus. They were renovating the lobby while I was there, which was a bit annoying, but nothing major. I may stay again, but it would be only because of the price.

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful We stayed here for 10 nights in October. The hotel itself is a bit dated and basic and needs upgrading but its nice and clean although they were decorating the lobby during our stay. We had a delux room on the 8th floor which was ok, but not what Id call delux. It had a nice view over the canal and mountains in the background. Waikik ibeach is 5mins walk and there are plenty of restaurants, bars, shopping and clubs within walking distance. Breakfast was nice, serving toast, coffee,tea and pastries every morning. The pool area was nice enough too , with a hot tub. The bar is open from 12am-4am every day and is fairley cheap, also selling snacks. They also have a hospitality room with a TV and internet connection. Id stay here again, though I doubt I will ever return to Hawaii as we were disappointed with it.

<Content>Friendly place to stay..... My visit to the Waikiki Sand Villa took place Sept 29-Oct 8 2006...I've been to Waikiki many times and usually stay at another budget hotel about a block away but their rates were pretty high this time. I found an EXCELLENT rate on Expedia for the WSV and decided to give it a try. There were good and bad things about this hotel....First-the good things:The staff was very friendly and helpful-front desk, valet and housekeeping. Upon checking in and checking out, the front desk really made me feel that they were happy to have me as a guest. That alone might make me want to return!The pool area is very nice! There is not alot of sun in the morning but by afternoon there are quite a few sunny areas. There are tables and chairs as well as lounge chairs and many people had lunch or coctails poolside. Nice place to hang out if you tire of the sand at the beach :)Nice little workout room right by the pool with several treadmills and other equipment. I did not use it because I ran by the canal and the running path by the zoo, but it would be nice for someone who likes to work out in air conditioning.The Sand Bar sports bar with big screen TVs is a great place to hang out. Located right inside the lobby of the hotel, it's a fun place to have cocktails. They have happy hour daily from 4-7 with $2 beer and $2 glasses of wine (although I wish they would change their brand of wine. There are so many good ones that are inexpensive that taste a whole lot better :) They are in the process of renovating the bar area and it looks like it will be about 3 times the size when they are finished. Free internet service is located in the bar and it's nice to have a drink and check your email. Freddy the bartender is great...very friendly and he makes a great Mai Tai (which are $1 cheaper at happy hour). I met alot of nice locals that hang out here too.The location of the hotel is convenient. Just about two blocks from the beach and right across the street from the Ala Wai Canal. There is a Food Pantry across the street that is fully stocked with grocery items with a little bakery and deli. They also have a large selection and good prices and on beer and wine.The hotel and hotel room was clean. I stayed in room 620-a room with a double bed and a twin bed (considered a premium city corner room). While it was evident that the carpet was a bit worn and the bathroom really needs updated, it was clean although small. The housekeeping service was better some days than others but I always had clean towels and they always cleaned the bathroom daily. The room also had a nice size mini refrigerator which I stocked with some items from the Food Pantry. There was also a 4 cup coffee maker with 1 free pack of coffee. (You could purchase more at the front desk for $1 if you so desired). The only problem was that the plug for the coffee maker did not reach the outlet in the back of the wall so I had to sit the tray on the floor to make coffee. No big deal really. There was ample drawer space and a place to hang your clothes with hangers furnished. The cable TV offered plenty of stations if you want to unwind with tv at the end of the night or catch the news in the morning. A desk with one chair sat in the corner. This room was comfortable enough for 2 people. A bit small but I've been in smaller rooms.The hotel did have a safe available in the room to use for $2.50 a day. What I appreciated the most about this is that they did not automatically charge you, like alot of hotels do. If you wanted to use the safe you asked the front desk for a key for it. Otherwise there was no charge. Nice.There is valet parking available for approx $9.50 per day with in and out privilleges. We were always able to park no matter what time of the day we went in and out. I did, on occasion see parking available at the meters on the side street.Now the cons---none of which ruined my vacation!I would not book a 'premium' room again. They consider it a premium room because it has 2 balconies. The balconies are very small and NOT worth the extra cost. It was still nice to sit outside and have a glass of wine. (there are 2 chairs and a small table). I had a city premium corner room but still had a bit of a view of the Ala Wai Canal (very pretty, with the golf course in the background). The view of the city was nothing pretty.The noise in the morning of the 'beeping' of the garbage trucks was annoying. It started pretty early (like 5 am) and lasted what seemed like forever! :) after a few days I started getting use to it but it might be less noisy on a higher floor. I was on the 6th.Both the bathroom sink and the bathtub drain backed up daily. I had to learn just how much I could turn the faucets on to avoid the tub and sink filling up. Annoying but I finally got a system down! :) Perhaps management could occasionally 'snake' the pipes to avoid this.The complementary breakfast by the pool was a nice gesture but it's mainly white toast and prepackaged doughnut holes. It would be nice if they just offered some wheat toast, bagels or fruit with coffee. The coffee cups were very small styrofoam cups that you could drink down in two gulps. Perhaps bigger cups with lids so you could fill your cup and hit the road. Also, they only serve until 9am. After a night on the town it's nice to sleep in since it's vacation :) Still, it was nice that they made an effort to offer something to their guests.My stay here was pleasant and I had a wonderful time while on Oahu. I climbed Diamond Head one morning and it was a nice workout! Make sure you take a water bottle! The view from the top is beautiful. Lots of wonderful restaurants. I especially like Chuck's Cellar located a block away in the Ohana East. Wonderful prime rib with a nice soup and salad bar. It's also a piano bar-dark with lots of ambiance and high leather booths. A great place for a mai tai with a gorgeous view is the Hale Koa Hotel located next door to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The Barefoot Bar is really nice and we met some great people there.I hope your future travels are happy ones!Lisa

<Content>Would go back I wasn't too sure about this hotel beforehand, but once we had settled in we loved the place! Ok, the food isn't great but there are so many places to eat in Waikiki that it wasn't a problem. We had a premium corner room with a great view of the golf course and Diamond Head. It was a bonus to be able to watch the sun rise in the morning from our bed. If you're looking for a comfortable hotel on a budget then this is the one. If you're looking for luxury then go to the Hilton. You don't spend that much time in your room when you're in Waikiki anyway. All in all, the reception staff were helpful (although the bar staff were rude) housekeeping was pleasant, room and bed was comfortable....My advice is spend the money you save by staying here on enjoying yourself in Waikiki.

<Content>Great Hotel, I would stay there again any time Ok, so I took a chance, I read the reviews, and thought it wouldn't be so bad, I had seen some reviews like this place is awful, I would never stay here again, so I was very surprised to see what a wonderful hotel it was. First of all, the carpet was perfect, it wasn't dirty torn up or stained, second of all, the service was terrific, I was a little surprised that they only gave us one pack of coffie, but I got over it. The rooms were very clean, no mold in any of them, and the hotel is only a very short walk from the beach, at most 10 minutes, there is a small restauraunt on the first floor that serves great smoothies, and a sushi bar. The hotel has a beautifully decorated and furnished hospitality floor, with 8 or nine windows xp computers, and a printer for 20 cents a copy. The continental Breakfast consisted of some filling but rather cheap pastrys, with hot toast, and coffie, and the pool looked beautiful though I didnt go in. All in all I think this was a great hotel, and I would gladly stay here again.

<Content>Good location that met our needs We stayed at the Waikiki Sand Villas after reading several good reviews. We are a family of 4, two adults with two children aged 11  13. The room we had contained two double beds, with everything you'd expect, tv, coffee facilities, fridge etc. The room was clean as was the bathroom. The pillows were flat, so after one night i requested three more, and they were left behind whilst we were out. The hospitality room is a god send, as we checked out at 11am, then had to wait until 8pm before we went to the airport. The hotel also has a laundry room, which after travelling for some time is also a must! We used the gym a couple of times and swam in the pool, both being clean and comfortable. One little problem which happened a few times was the lifts would stop working, so we had to walk down several flights of stairs, for us not a problem, but for older people could prove difficult. The hotel is on a corner, and there is some traffic noise throughout the night, but the location makes up for that small inconvenience. We were close to shops, supermarkets and the beach. We took a tour to the Arizona and Missouri, and had a great day out with our tour guide. We booked this through the lovely lady in the hotel lobby.I'd stay here again!

<Content>Not for a romantic outing The place was very slum like ... even the paint colors reminded me of a low budget motel somewhere. People walked around yelling and screaming and slamming doors. I wondered if I was in an apartment building. The continental breakfast is watered down orange soda, toast thrown on a plate after you sign a paper saying you got some food, and coffee that makes your stomache hurt all day. The pillows were rock hard and the bed sounded like it would break as you sat on it. You can hear the TV in the next room. The place is real lowly... but if it's just friends hanging out, it might be perfect. The pool is great, the bar and pool tables make you feel like you're hanging out. Valet is one person for like 30 people, so leave your room early (there's ONLY valet parking $10 a day). Not recommended.

<Content>Very Decent Stayed there for three nights in July 2006. For the price it really is a clean, well maintained place. Not on the beach but is within walking distance. We had a standard room on the top floor so the view was of the Ala Wai canal and the city, which was nice. The bar and pool are full of people having a great time. There is an internet connection in the rooms but the WiFi is down in the lobby only. The bathroom was clean but the shower backed up every time. The parking rate was decent (about ten dollars a day) but it is valet parking only and the system is not terribly organized. No room service, but snack food avaliable at the bar. If you must stay in Waikiki (and I don't recommend doing so) you might as well save some money and stay in this place.

<Content>Okay for a Budget Hotel We stayed in the Waikiki Sand Villa for 3 nights in May. The wireless internet for only guests was a plus and the free continental breakfast was decent. We had a corner room so we were able to open the 2 linai doors for the fresh breezes. The decor was dated and the room was on the damp side, but most of our hotels in Hawaii were a little damp. (We stayed in 6 hotels in various parts of the islands.) We really only used the hotel to sleep and toured the island during the day. Decent budget hotel if you are just looking for a place to lay your head and aren't overly picky. What do you expect for $79???

<Content>Bargain!!!! This is a great hotel.... The decor is a little dated but thats the only complaint I have!! Location is perfect, staff are friendly, complimentary breakfast is served by the pool each morning, theres free internet access for guests and a lovely bar for a quiet evening drink. You will not find this for the price anywhere else in Waikiki. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay here again.

<Content>It's a Bargin!! My wife and I stayed at the Waikiki Sand Villa for 3 days in June '06. Considering the hotel is just 3 short blocks away from the beach and its dirt cheap compared to the other hotels on the beach, I felt it was a steal! I've stayed at 3,4, and 5 star hotels and yes they may be more luxurious, but why pay an arm and a leg to look at your eyelids (sleeping) if you know you'll be out and about in beautiful Hawaii. It looked like and older Holiday Inn and the staff was courteous and our requests (just for an ironing board and directions) were met quickly. Valet parking is $9.50, but that seems to be anywhere near Waikiki. We paid just $79!!!!! per night. We just walked over the the larger 4 and 5 star hotels to hang out, but laid our head at the pretty decent Sand Villa. If you want to be pampered and stay in your hotel most of the day, don't stay here. But if you're looking for a bargin and plan to sleep in you room for a pit stop each day, then you can find a bargin here.

<Content>GREAT LITTLE HOTEL As a business traveller; I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. The High Speed in the rooms was great (bring your cable!) The new work out room is super and the hotel is right on the Ala Wai to get out to the H1. They also have a business room with computers and copier-I didn't use it as I didn't need it. The carpeting is well worn, but the bathrroom is immaculate with great pressure in the shower, the staff is nice (helpful, but they won't kill themselves for you) and the elevators are slow...but they are putting in new ones.That said, I'd never bring my wife or family here as they would hate it. The rooms are small, the aircon doesn't work very well (they need ceiling fans!), don't be fooled by breakast - it is just donuts and coffee, the pool is nice and the bar is not bad. But, if you come here with the family, you need to be by the beach.The Valet Parking is a nice touch, but at certain times it can be really bad as they are really tight on space...but at $9.37 per day, it is a good deal. They also have done some cool things with their wifi by the pool and their internet access by the bar.As a business traveller, this place fit all of my needs. If you are looking for something with a lot of extras, spend the bucks and stay in one of the big hotels by the beach.

<Content>Great Deal at Sand Villa I stayed at Sand Villa during first week of April 2006. I had read some reviews criticizing the hotel for the carpet, size of rooms, old feel, etc. This isn't the Sheraton and it doesn't charge exorbitant rates. If you want a beautiful fancy hotel, don't stay here and then be unhappy about it. It is what it is. If you are comfortable with modest accomodations, well, this is the place for you.I loved this place as did the rest of the people who I met there. We had an little room with a view of the canal and golf course. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and did a great job of making sure we had clean towels. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful with their knowledge of the local area. Dennis was fantastic with great directions and information.The parking fees are low for that area and the valet service was excellent. There was one time we had to wait for our car but that was the exception.The pool area is quiet and relaxing. The pool was a bit chilly. The Sand bar was a great little place to relax and the free internet access was excellent. The proximity to the beach, bars, shopping and restaurants was only 2 blocks.This is a great place to stay if you are an economy traveller and don't plan on staying in your room to often.

<Content>***NOT RECOMMENDED*** We arrived on the Island a few days early to explore the place so we booked into this hotel for four nights before moving to a nicer hotel for a conference. We were aware that we had booked into a budget hotel so weren't expecting anything fantastic. It suited us to do so as we intended to be out visiting the Islands sights most of the time but we didn't expect what we got.Firstly the room we stayed in was very damp  cold. We were unable to get any heat into it. The carpet had most certainly seen better days-you would not feel comfortable walking on it in bare feet  the bathroom was very very grotty. The whole place felt dirty. Decor was very old.The domestic staff were very pleasant  our room was cleaned each day but sleeping in a damp musky room was just not at all pleasant. We found all bar one of the front desk staff very rude  unhelpful. The bar staff were unbelievable  the waitresses had more interest in standing smoking cigarettes during their shift in full view of customers then serving customers. My girlfriend tried asking one of the wairesses were the restroom was one evening but she was more interested in giggling with two guys then answering her question. We could not actually believe how little respect for their jobs most of the staff have. We obviously will not be staying at this hotel again. Dr Gavin Convey

<Content>I would stay again My husband and I stayed here for 8 nights in November 2005 after booking last minute through Expedia. We were a bit weary about staying at this hotel after reading previous reviews. However, can I just say that, the first time we stayed in Waikiki, it was in a top class hotel and once we closed our hotel room door, there was little comparison between the Sands Villa and the top class hotel room - both were clean, slightly old fashioned in decor but a great base to stay. We stayed on the 7th floor and overlooked the local canal which was picturesque. We thought the hospitality room was a nice touch, with free internet access and the facilities in the bar, ie Pool, Darts. The complimentary breakfast was extremely basic - altough surprisingly enjoyable - after all we had not paid to eat there. All in all we found this hotel to be a good base and would stay here again.

<Content>Never again We'd been staying with a friend who lives in Waikiki, but needed to get a room at the last minute due to unforseen circumstances. Unfortunately we thought we'd save some money by staying at the Sand Villa for two nights before moving on to the very expensive Hyatt (which is the only hotel available this weekend due to the NFL Pro Bowl.) Big mistake.We requested a non-smoking room because I'm pregnant and very sensitive to smells. We were told at check-in that they're full and so we were being given a smoking room, but there's a brisk wind so if you open the door to the lanai, it should be okay. Well it is not. The room smells so bad it's almost unbearable. I did leave the door to the lanai open until 3 a.m. at which point I had to shut it in order to finally sleep. The traffic outside of the hotel along the canal is horrible, even at 3 a.m., and very noisy. We also requested 1 bed (a double bed is the only option) but were instead given a room with a small double and a single bed which I can't even call a twin because it's so small. The mattresses are 30 years old I'm sure and very, very uncomfortable. The room is very tiny to begin with, so having both beds leaves very little room to maneuver around or to stow luggage.Some other unpleasant surprises in our tiny, tiny room (besides the horrible lemon-lime sherbet decor) were hair from the prior guest on the floor of the bathroom (the bathroom smelled like urine I might add,) and a huge blob of black hair on one of the pillows. The carpet is so slimy I won't walk around without my flip flops on, you can hear every noise in the hotel all night long. The mini-fridge in our room rattles and makes a strange noise for 10 seconds after each time it runs (also making it hard to sleep,) and there's a thick layer of dust around the perimeter of the room and on top of the TV. This is obviously not a room they use (1104) unless the hotel is very full. Beware if you're checking into a full hotel! The pool was completely shaded by 3p yesterday when we checked in and with the strong trade winds and mid 70's we've been experiencing, it is hard to be outside without the benefit of the sun to warm you. As an FYI - parking is $10/nt.The positives to this hotel are the free internet service in the hospitality room for guests and the mini-fridge in your room. The lobby bar stays open until 4a if that's important to you, but it's usually quite crowded. It's about 3 blocks to Waikiki and the view of the canal/mountains in the other direction is pretty. We paid $110 for the first night and $160 for the second night (plus taxes and fees on Expedia.) I wish we would've paid the extra and gotten a room in the $189 range that was clean and well cared for. Staying here has made me feel better about the insane $325/nt we're paying for the Hyatt this weekend, knowing that we'll be leaving the Sand Villa and never returning!

<Content>Not bad for the money My family stay at the Waikiki Sand Villa for two nights from December 23rd to the 25th. Eight of us flew in two days before the cruise left in order to see Pearl Harbor, the USS Arizona Memorial,  the USS Missouri. We booked our own airfare and hotel instead of going through NCL America. This was cheaper and worked fine since we were arriving so much before the cruise. It is cheap 鈥?but not that great of a hotel. They have no airport shuttle, nor any suggestions on how to get there from the airport. When we arrived at approximately 10 p.m. Honolulu time (it was 2 a.m. to our jet lagged minds and bodies,) we found out that half the hotel did not have electricity! The power had been off for about an hour and a half and they didn鈥檛 know when they would gain full power again. The kicker was that they 鈥渄idn鈥檛 know鈥?which half the hotel had power and which half didn鈥檛!! They suggested we buy a drink at the bar and wait a half hour because then they might have enough power to run the elevators and get our luggage to us on the third floor. We had my 72  76-year-old grandparents with us, and explained that there was no way they could wait that long. The management was unwilling to find someone to carry the bags up to the third floor for them. My husband and my room was the only one with power, so we all just took a carry-on up. My 70 year-old grandparents and my mother had to take showers in complete darkness. My uncle and my husband waited up for another hour until the power came on the elevators worked. When we telephoned the front desk to ask if our luggage would be delivered soon, they answered maybe. My husband and uncle then went down, found the manager, and had to force the manager to bring up the luggage himself because the bell boy went home. The next day and nights鈥?stays were much better. The rooms are clean and had nice amenities, such as mini fridges and lanais which were much appreciated. The hotel claims to have a free continental breakfast, but it is merely dry mini-doughnuts, orange juice drink (not actual orange juice) and coffee. The pool is very nice 鈥?beautiful and warm. The only problem with the pool is the hours. It doesn鈥檛 open until 9 a.m. and closes at 9 p.m. The hotel also has free high-speed Internet access for hotel guests. There is a hospitality room with 5 computers in it for guests鈥?use. The hotel did suggest a nice restaurant at a sister hotel for my grandparent's 50th wedding aniversary. However, when we asked where the shuttle they had promised to take us there was they denied ever making the promise. They gave us walking directions to the restaurant and turned away.Overall it is an okay hotel. It is good for the price - if you get it cheap through hotwire.com or Expedia. The rooms are clean and there are a few good amenities. It is only two blocks to Waikiki Beach - an easy walk. So, would we stay here agian? Probably not, but if you are not that picky or are broke it could be the place for you.

<Content>Enjoyable Stay I stayed with my family at the Waikiki Sand Villa in November was better than I anticipated. I had read some of the reviews and was wondering what to expect. However, I had no problems. The room was clean and beds were made up each day. The hotel cleaning staff always said good morning and I found the desk staff friendly as well. The continental breakfast was all right and the coffee and toast was hot.Valet parking was a breeze and it was only a short walk to all of Waikiki's shopping.

<Content>I'd stay here again Perhaps some rooms here are better than others, because I certainly had no complaints about cleanliness, bedding etc. I wasn't expecting the Ritz for the price i was paying. My room was on the 7th floor - 2 double beds, decent-sized room, decor was nice (quite light and airy), drawers were big enough to put my clothes in and there was enough space to leave baggage in, room was clean and the shower was good (decent water pressure, adjustable shower head). I have to say that the lobby was a little off-putting (there's a bar on one side, and the lobby area seems kind of cramped) but the rooms were fine. I didnt use the pool so can't comment on that, but they were renovating the pool area when I was there so there should be a bit of an upgrade.Overall, the place was pleasant enough and fine for the average vacation.

<Content>worse than ever imagined We checked into this hotel following a wonderful cruise on the Serenade of the Seas ship (Royal Caribbean) and could not believe our eyes what we saw. I cannot even begin to write all that was needing cleaned or fixed in this hotel. From the moment you enter the smell of old cooking grease coming from the dingy bar area to the run down dirty greeting area sets the tone of what is yet to come. Our beds had head and body hairs in them, the box spring part of the bed was stained with food and body fluids. The blankets were so old and worn. Dust was abundant to the point you could write your name in it. The bathroom had hair in it, the mirror had not been cleaned with toothpaste splatter all over it. The carpet was worn and stained. The tracks in the sliding doors to the deck was so full of dirt it grated on your teeth when you opened and closed the door. The room smelled musty, dusty and unclean. I could go on more and more. When we complained they said they had no more rooms as they were full. So I wrote a list of things to be cleaned before we would accept the room. We went out to the pool area, which did have a decent size pool, but the hottub was black around the whole top of it, but I think this was just bare cement and had not been painted but was certainly not attractive. We then said we would go for a walk to wait for our room to be cleaned and on our way out I slipped an fell on the driveway where the non skid strips had worn down. I came back into the hotel being helped by my husband and the bell man that had witnessed the fall. I had scraped my knee fairly badly so there was a lot of blood. I asked for a cloth to wipe it off, and they came back and told me twice that they had nothing to help me, no cloth or bandaids, in fact they told me that they were not able to give out any bandaids. Then another bell man came a long and did get me some dry paper towels. Then a manager came a long and asked the bell man if the driveway was slippery and he said like a skating rink. So they then upgraded us to a suite.Well this was somewhat better, but still filthy dirty. There was NO hot water unless you ran the taps for 8-10 minutes and then it was only warm. The room smelled old as well. The curtains were filthy dirty along with the dust. But what really got me was the dried urine all over the toilet lid and back of the toilet. I was tired of complaining so we just put up with it for 2 nights and have never been so glad to return home. Fortunately the cruise was absolutely wonderful and would recommend Royal Caribbean Serenade of the Seas ship for anyone. Next time I would go with the reviews (which I did read before I left but our travel agent was unable to find us anything else in the package company we had booked through) and book somewhere else. Saving a little bit of money cannot be worth ruining your holiday. This could be such a cute hotel if some money would be put into it!!

<Content>hotel needs an upgrade. Waikiki Sands Villa is a medicore hotel at best. While the rates are low the level of cleanliness is not the best, rooms are small dingy and noisey. The carpet is worn and dingy and the bathroom could use a thorough cleaning. I was surprised that the bed linens spread etc. were stained and worn. The baloncy is nice but noisey and there is no light for the evening.Continental breakfast is offered as a perk. it is very basic. There is a hospitality room on the service floor that holds pcs, a tv and couch, the atmosphere here is very much like a rec room. The pool however is quite nice, nicer than the rest of the hotel.I was disappointed after a two week stay when I asked for an extention beyond the 11 am check out (my flights was 9pm) I was not accomodated or even given a bit more time. I was furthur dissapointed that when it came time to settle the bill there was a number of disputed charges for services that I had not used. Please note that along with on site parking charge there is a charge for the room safe on a daily basis. I rate this hotel at below average and would give it 2 stars not three that travelocity is declaring it. Look around for a better hotel, although with all the choices in Waikiki it is certainly difficult to choose.

<Content>Dirty and Cheap - Watch for hidden fees! This hotel is cheaply priced -- and boy do you pay for it! I have two main complaints: (1) The place is dirty and (2) There are hidden fees. The website contains misleading statements, so watch out.I stayed at this hotel for four days in mid-August 2005. It was a terrible experience and extremely disappointing. When I arrived in my room, the sheets on my bed were dirty. There were dark spots and what looked like makeup or self-tanner on the white sheet. I requested an immediate change of sheets from housekeeping. When the maid arrived, she told me that the hotel policy was to change sheets only every third day. If I wanted the sheets changed daily, I would have to call every day. There was no green policy posted regarding sheets, so this was not a water conservation issue. Not wanting to sleep on dirty sheets, I dutifully called each day to request that they be changed. Much to my horror, on my last night at the hotel, I discovered both the sheets and the pillowcases were dirty again. When I called to complain, I was told housekeeping was closed, but they would send someone up with cleansheets. I spent the night sleeping on the blanket and bedspread and vowed never to return. The other main problem I have with this hotel is the use of hidden fees. The website advertises several amenities that seem like they are included in your room rate -- but they are not. The website says the rooms have safety deposit boxes, but they charge you $2.00 a day to use them. Also you only get one free packet of coffee when you arrive. After that, if you want coffee for the coffee maker in your room, they charge you $1.00 per packet. Valet parking is $9 a day and you have to sign in for your free crappy continental breakfast. I should have known better when I was quoted an unbelievable rate of $86.00 a night. I wish I had chosen a different hotel which might have cost more, but at least would give me free coffee in my room!The website also advertises that the hotel is two blocks from the beach. Actually, it's closer to four. Why does this matter? Well, when you have to carry your heavy beach gear through the busy streets of Waikiki to the beach, every step makes a difference.Other issues/problems: The hotel staff is brusque to the point of being rude. Very inhospitable, especially in Hawaii. Bathroom tiles were chipped and uneven, making the place seem drab. The tub drained slowly each time I took a shower. The hospitality room door locks don't work well, and frequently won't accept your room card key. The continental breakfast is lame -- just crappy coffee, store-bought pastries cut in half, mini-donuts and dry white toast. The only good thing about this hotel is the free internet access in the hospitality room. I didn't have to lug my laptop with me to stay in touch. But the bar in the hotel has an internet cafe for a fee, so the free internet access isn't enough to make up for the dirty cheapness of this hotel.Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for a clean, nicer hotel. I wish I had!

<Content>Upgrade? I was obsessive with choosing a hotel for the last 3 days of my honeymoon...well I obviously should have paid attention to the person who had been upgraded to a room with 2 double beds when they just wanted one. My new bride and I show up to the hotel at about 3:30 and are told we have been upgraded to a suite. I thought nothing of it because every hotel you will ever go to on your honeymoon will upgrade you. We pulled our bags up to our room and realized that we had been given a room with 2 double beds. NOBODY on their honeymoon wants 2 double beds. We called and were told that there wasn't another room available and eventually were told there was another room available but they are 1/2 the size. Basically we got what we paid for.

<Content>Hotel Drab/Hawaii Fab! I love to get good deals on things, so this advice is geared to those that enjoy the same: Our trip to Waikiki/Honolulu was fabulous!!! Our stay at the Waikiki Sand Villa was the only disappointment. Their smallest rooms (around 70 per night) are indeed small. We upgraded to a suite for $95 and they are a bit larger w/kitchenette, but the carpet had stains and walls were marked up in areas. After looking at several rooms and staying in one, they were all dingy and somewhat dirty looking. The continental breakfast is just as others on this site have described. While walking around the city I noticed several restaurants offering low-cost breakfasts, so you really don't have to endure the nutritionally-deficient continental breakfasts that are offered at the Waikiki Sand Villa. Also, beware of the complimentary iron! I'd urge you to bring your own because it seemed difficult for staff to locate while we were there. I actually got one once during the end of my stay (we had to tip the housekeeper) and staff knocked on my door the next morning at 8 a.m. to get it back. At the end of the trip I had wished that we'd kept that tiny $70 a night room since we were in there so little of the time. My advice to first timers to Honolulu/Waikiki:1-Look at any on-line auction sites to get bargains for Hawaii. One is the Entertainment Book. This will save you a lot. 2-Use The Bus as much as possible. The locals can give great advice, but the only way that we got to meet many was by using the bus and waiting for the next one to arrive. You can get a 4 day pass at ABC stores or check out an online auction site. Also, the bus can be used when you leave the airport only if you carry one piece of luggage that can be placed on your lap and is convenient if you know where you are going and how to walk there. I'd do this if I go back, but first-timers might need more direction and taking a shuttle was helpful for us. 3-Purchase a good map and a book that will guide you on your trip, and do lots of research before you leave.4-Many locals shop at Aloha Stadium for souvenirs. You can save quite a bit by doing so and it is within walking distance of Pearl Harbor.Have fun on your trip!

<Content>Good Stay For the price of $75 a night it was well worth it. First I have to say that if it were not for JASON at the front desk I feel the trip may have been different. He worked with us over the phone beating the internet price. And then when we decided to extend our stay by 2 days he got us a room at the same rate when only the night before the girl working the front desk looked at me as if I were crazy for even asking to stay. She said no room no way no how. She didn't even have to look at the computer she just knew. Anyway she was an obvious idiot and Jason hooked us up in the morning apologizing for his ditsy co-worker. The only draw back is the $10 parking fee in addition to the room rate. But the staff is very friendly. The breakfast is free and consists of donuts and toast. The rooms were very clean, the A/C is weak but the room is just fine. If you are high maintenance this place is not for you but if you do not mind a 2 block walk to the waikiki beach and a 4-7pm happy hour with $2 drafts this place is for you.

<Content>vacation of a lifetime I am on my last day of my trip and am writing this in the hospitality room of the Waikiki Sand Villa. Buget Hotel but clean, staff is exceptional and has amenities such as lovely pool, game room, fun internet bar. We arrived Thursday, June 2. Our first day was to just hang out and get over jet lag. We visited the beach and ate lunch at Lu Lu's on the beach. Day two we booked a trip to Sea Life Park and did the Dolphin Discover. It was very fun and there was quite a bit of interaction with our dolphin. On Sunday my son talked me into Extreme Parasailing..it was very windy which made the trip 1,000 feet up a little more than interesting. Monday we rented a car for two days and drove through Oahu up to the Dole Pinapple Plantation, the Falls, and on to the Resort at Turtle Bay for Lunch. We had to get back to go to the Luau at the Royal Hawaiian Resort. It was great, well organized and the show was very entertaining. A young tahitian girl asked my son on stage to dance...at first he was shy, then really got into it. On our walk back we noticed Waikiki at night is very interesting with many people watching opportunities. Tuesday, we drove to the south of Oahu and up the coast to the Polynisian Cultural Center. We didn't stay for the show since we were getting pretty exhausted and needed to get the car back. On Wednesday, we spent the day at the beach (bring lots of sun screen!!). Wednesday night we had a trip on the Fun Bottom Fishing tour. Fishing was slow but they did a great job of making sure everyone had a good time. Waikiki at night is beautiful from an ocean view. Thursday, we wanted to do something that would take up most of the day since our plane left at 8:30. Absolutely don't miss snorkling. Most people went to the bay close by but i hear of way too many people. We booked our trip with Captain Bob's. This had to have been the best time we have ever had here. They take you to a sand bar where you can practice snorkling or play s and volley ball in knee high water. on the way there we had many opportunites to see the sea turtles surface to take a look at us. We were then served lunch on the boat and moved on to the reef where we saw so many fish by the beautiful reef. My son and I got a rare opportunity to see a Morey Eel swim by and go into the rocks. Hawaii has so much to offer and going with an open mind makes the trip memorable. We booked all but one tour through Alohatopten and everything went off without any problems at all. All tours picked us up and dropped us off at our hotel or one that was within 2 blocks from our hotel. I am definitly coming back!!

<Content>Great Stay, Nice People My first Visit to Honolulu, I choose this hotel. WAIKIKI SAND VILLA HOTEL It was cheap and located near beach, trolley, International Market. Also because of the View to the Canal and Mountains. This was a great choice, from the Desk Staff to the Maids who kept our rooms clean and neat. I would give the staff 10 stars for making my first visit so wonderful. I enjoyed the Sand Bar, with its staff of interesting people. I met quite a few locals who told me a lot about Hawaii and made me feel very confortable.  The Pool was cold, and the hot tub warm. Just what I needed after a day of shopping or touring the Island. So if you want a good nights sleep, nicely made drink, quick look at sports or just a restful stay near a shaded pool..try this Hotel. It should have 3 stars. The Staff really makes you feel welcome. I intend to return next year.  Aloha

<Content>Sand Villa satisfys us We just came back from honolulu, stayed in this hotel for 7days in Premium Corner with golf course view. It was very, very good. 4 years ago, we had an unforgetabble terrible time staying in Waikiki Grand , so this time we were very careful to pick a good one, and we made it!The view of Ala Wai Canal, Diamond Head,  Golf Course was so beautiful. Room size was rather small than I expected, but good enough for us with a dressor with plenty of drawers. Bath room was also good with tub and a movable shower head. Parking was US$9.50,  plus tip for the attendants as valet parking only. Free continental breakfast... maybe good for trying at least once. If your flight is ealier arrival or late depature, this hotel provides such a great service for providing the Hospitality Room allowing us to use shower  internet by free. If we pick a complaint, maybe traffic noise at night time from the roads  hallways. We decided to stay in this hotel next time again.

<Content>A Real Bargain We stayed at the Waikiki Sand Villa for four nights in mid-December, 2004. All rooms and halls had just been totally redecorated--new furniture, carpets, paint, etc. The room was clean and attractive, and the bed was comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was sufficient: coffee/tea, juice, pastries, donuts, and toast. The hotel's location is within easy walking distance of the major attractions of Waikiki, and there is a very good buffet restaurant, Perry's, less than a block away. Given that we paid only $64 per night, this hotel is a real bargain. If we were to return to Honolulu, we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel We must agree with all the comments Given by the family from Vancouver.(Dec 20th 2004). We had room 1006. Both elevators were working, no problem there. They are still doing renevations and upgrades to the Hotel. 2 day's before we left we watched them bring in 6-8 new computer desks and a whole stack of new computer equipment. Free breakfast was a bonus.The only downside was the traffic noise. I'm not sure you would find it any quieter in any other hotel in Waikiki. Yes we would definitely stay at the Waikiki Sand Villa again.

<Content>Great for the price. On our second and third trip to Hawaii we stayed at the Sand Villa. The first time we spent a lot more money and the hotel was much grander with restuarants, shops and more. But you are not at the hotel except to sleep because there is so much to do and see in Waikiki. The rooms at the Villa are clean and the staff is good. The view of the canal and Diamond Head are gorgeous. Booking day trips is very easy in the lobby with helpful staff. The free breakfast was great, pleny of danish and coffee, juice. The pool area was nice though I must admit I didn't use the pool on either stay because the beaches on the island are phenominal. The beach is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. I will stay there again. No frills but you can save a thousand dollars a week by not staying right on the ocean.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Sand Villa for 15 nights (Nov 3-18) and were quite pleased with the hotel, service and location. Having read previous reviews before going, we were on guard for a room that was sub par but must say the room we had was wonderful. (#1007) Yes it was small but the view and balcony made up for it and it had been freshly painted, new bed furniture etc and was very clean. The shower was wonderful having lots of pressure and not just a trickle like many higher priced hotels. For the long evenings there were about 30 television channels. The in-suite fridge was also a real plus. We were charged for the room safe but the peace of mind was well worth the few dollars. The free Internet in the bar area was a nice touch and allowed us to keep up with email from family. having a limited amount of time kept us from staying on to longDuring the time we were there the one elevator was being redone and so having only one elevator for a 12 story hotel meant for some long waits at times but we survived and it was a good way to meet other guests.The pool area was lovely and was never crowded. The chairs at poolside were older and had seen better days but we again managed and had great tans to show for it.The hotel is in a great location next to the canal which has a nice quiet walkway and also close to the shops and restaurants. A large grocery store is a block away and was very handy. a block to the 鈥橞us鈥?and close to the marketplace but tucked away as not to be as busy as hotels right close to the beach. Yet if you wanted the beach it was about a 3 block walk.I think it comes down to what you pay for is what you get so if you are looking for a 5 star hotel then do not stay at the Sand Villa. If on the other hand you want something clean, in a great location and a great price then this is the place for you. We will stay here again without a doubt.

<Content>Sand Villa a great deal for the price We stayed at the sand villa for 10 days in late October. We enjoyed our stay and had all posative experiences. Rooms are small but clean and very quiet with a nice balcony with a view of the moutains and a golf course. Continental breakfast had coffee, juice, sweet rolls, and toast. Happy hour had cheap drinks and bar had large screen tv with several smaller ones. Parking will cost you 9.50 per day in underground garage. Location is excellant, just three blocks to shopping, restaurants, and the beach. Pool area and hot tub were never crowded and close at 9 o clock nightly.

<Content>Unbelievable Our emails requesting information were never answered. We decided to book anyway and our internet booking 2 months ahead of our trip was accepted, but when we phoned to ask why nobody had sent us a confirmation or charged our credit card we were told that there was no booking and that they were full anyway. Our flight is due to arrive late at night and we would have been stranded without accomodation. We won't bother trying here again.

<Content>Great value for the money I stayed here in June 2003 for a business trip. This was my first trip to Hawaii, and it was nice someone else was paying for the air and rooms, so I didn't want to book anything really expensive. The rate sounded great. I booked through my travel agent, and got one of those corner rooms facing the ocean and canal/mountains. While the A/C wasn't as cool as I wanted it to be, I just bought a small table fan for nighttime (I am always warm). The pool was terrific, the free internet was great, the bar was good, the breakfast Ok but free, and the location next to the canal and 3 blocks from the beach was great. The ice machine on my floor was broken and the carpet in the hall a little worn, but the room was clean and comfortable. Parking was tight but Ok. While it's not a Four Seasons or full-service Marriott I'm used to staying in for business, it's also not as expensive as them either! You get what you pay for. I am going back with my wife in March for a few days on Oahu (then to Mauii and the Big Island for a total of 2 weeks in Hawaii), we will stay here. We won't be in our room much, so I think it's a great deal. But I won't book on Expedia after reading these reviews!

<Content>fine for the price I was a little afraid to stay at the Sand Villa after some of the reviews I read while researching hotels in Honolulu. I decided to bite the bullet and stay there completely due to the price. We booked for 10 nights (Sept 22-Oct 2) through a travel agent and Fun sun vacations and got a room for $89 (canadian) per night. Ok.....the place is not the Hyatt so don't expect the Hyatt when you get there!! The rooms were clean and I felt safe there. The pool was nice and large. They offer a free continental breakfast but as others have stated, its not that great. It consists of powdered donuts, donut holes, fruit danishes and toast. You also have a choice of tea, coffee or juice(pineapple i think). Our room was on the 4th floor and had a partial view of the canal. We were going to upgrade to a higher room if we found it too noisy, but to be honest, the hum of the air conditioning drowned out most street noise so we stayed on the 4th. We had asked for a non-smoking room with a queen bed but got a smoking room with a king bed. It didn't smell of smoke at all so that was o.k. The bar in the lobby is fine and offers good happy hour specials and the free internet is great. The laundry room is kind of dingy but most people probably won't be there long enough to use it. The reception staff were o.k, Not overly friendly but we had very few dealings with them anyway. All in all, the hotel is fine and you really aren't there all that much. There are much nicer hotels but they are also alot more expensive. The location to the beach is about 3 blocks and it'll only take you about 5 minutes to walk there. I would probably not stay there again but only because I would probably want to try somewhere different next time(this was our first time in hawaii) . Hope this helps somebody who is trying to choose a hotel. I know I agonized over choosing a place for months before we went!! P.S Take coffee, they only give it to you free once and then you have to buy it from the front desk!!

<Content>Nice place, beautiful view My best friend and I stayed at the Waikiki Sand Villa in May 2004. We had a pleasant time there and felt it was well worth what we paid. We had a room with a beautiful view of the canal and it seemed pretty quiet for Waikiki. The staff was friendly and didn't seem to mind when we made several requests (we changed our room, asked for an iron twice, asked for directions, etc.) We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A good hotel for the price My girl and I stayed at the Waikiki Sand Villa from 04 May from 21 May with a package deal from Expedia. The hotel is a very clean and well kept place. The floor we stayed on (the 9th) the carpet wasn鈥檛 worn or soiled. The room was clean and made up everyday. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was some confusion on the parking for Expedia customers. First they told me that if you booked on the internet you didn鈥檛 have to pay, but later they called me in the room saying they had made a mistake and I would have to after all. But I forgot to go down and pay so I never did. The parking area was really tight and hard to maneuver in. The refrigerator in the room didn鈥檛 work in the room; I was going to switch rooms but we never had anything to put in it. The breakfast wasn鈥檛 that bad. Yes, all it consisted of some assorted doughnuts, toast, some Danishes, coffee, juice, and tea but it was free. We thought the pool was great. The pool was surrounded by a variety tropical plants and trees which made for a nice backdrop. The hot tub was nice too. No problems with the A/C, shower, or towels. The hotel is only like a five minute walk from the beach and is in walking distance to many restaurants and shopping centers. A pretty nice view could be seen from the balcony in the room. Internet in the lobby isn鈥檛 free but you get 30 minutes if you buy a drink. Overall the hotel isn鈥檛 quiet a three star but was good enough for the price and for somewhere to stay. Nobody goings to Hawaii to stay in the hotel room all day anyway.

<Content>No longer 3 Stars My husband and I were very excited to be going to hawaii for the first time. We knew we would be out and about, so we didn't mind paying a little less for a hotel, since we wouldn't be in it often. I have been planning this trip for a year. We couldn't afford a 5 star hotel, but we wanted at least a 3 star. The Waikiki was not only 3 stars(at the time), but it had really good reviews prior to us booking our trip. We arrived late on April 22, 2004. My husband was informed that since we booked our trip through expedia, we would not receive free parking, even though that was someting that was told on the website. i was a little upset. We get to the parking lot and there is no where to park. We go back upstairs and are told to just double park and leave your keys at the front desk. The last time I check I don't know those people let alone what kind of drivers they are. As mentioned in an earlier review, the are car scraps on everything. our room has stains everywhere, the toilet seat is broken on one side. We are given a room with a full size bed as well as a twin, when asked why this was done, that was all that was left. Even though I booked and paid for my trip 4 months ago. My husband and I made the most of our trip and even though the staff are really nice, we will NEVER stay there again. As on May 1, 2004, Expedia is now giving this hotel 2 stars, which i feel is more than enough.

<Content>Super-Friendly, Clean Offbeach Hotel I read the reviews on this web site. For those who did not like this hotel, they probably usually stay in a high dollar hotels. Our purpose in Hawaii was to have fun and spend the least amount of time in our room as possible. As such, this hotel was perfect. I had read the reviews about calling ahead for room specifics and it was well worth the effort. This hotel is very accommodating. Yes, the carpet in the halls may be in need of replacement and the walls may be in need of painting but a clean shower and clean sheets with no bugs is what we needed and what we got. The bar is awesome! Did not visit the pool. I would take friends there to stay. Our stay was 4/8/04+.

I thought it was very good value booked a flight-hotel deal with expedia from ny 450 dollars. service was friendly, rooms clean and spacious and it's only a few minutes to the beach. lovely to have a balcony looking towards the mountains. all in all - would definitely recommend this place. seemed a complete bargain compaired to the hotels in new york!

<Content>Wish I would have known more A word of advise if you are thinking about staying here and booking with expedia : don't.I thought this place was going to be quite nice and friendly from the reviews I read before making the reservation, but from the moment of check in we were in for a bumpy ride. I e-mailed to confirm the free internet/breakfast/parking/local call deal prior to us arriving there for our honeymoon. I also asked if it was available - an upgrade (i was hoping for a corner suite that everyone had previously reviewed). I got an email back saying they would do their best to get us an upgraded room - but since i was booking through expedia - it was partially out of their hands. Well since they did not tell me that the other offers did not apply to me i assumed it must be ok. Well i get there and they wanted to charge me for a week of parking right away - i very politely told them that i was under the impression that it was included and very shortly i was told that not for expedia customers. I told them i e-mailed about it - and the girl at the front went to the back to talk to the manager - came back - went back to the back - came back again - and asked me for the e-mail printed off. I did not bring it of course because I thought i wouldnt need it - iemailed the reservation manager directly.The girl then grugenly said well then i guess we have to honour it gave me a slip - i aplogized for not printing the paper and we were on our way. We parked in the - yes very small and awkard - lot. Went up to our room in the shambled of an elevator they had - down the hall of torn/warped carpet and banged up walls - to our room to find that our safe was not complementary as told as well.My husband went down to talk to the hotel staff - because i was tired of dealing with them by now - taking 20 minutes to check in. When he comes back they informed me that they found the e-mail and in no where in the e-mail is word of the free specials - we need to pay for everything that was supposed to be included.So i hesitenely went back down stairs to chat with them. I absolutely hate having to stir the pot - but here i went. After talking to the girl at the desk and the manager i realized that they were purposely not understanding what i was saying. I repeated myself 5 times - showing the parts of the e-mail that said these things - and they just said you booked with expedia - those are not expedia deals. They didn't even answer my questions on why - just saying over and over you booked with expedia and also saying so you are demanding these things? you cant have them. I was getting quite upset at this point. They informed us we got an upgrade to a superior room already - thats a bonus og 15 dollars a night - which basically included a twin bed in the room - so they were not going to do anything else. My husband asked for a comprromise - for us to meet half way. They pretended they didnt understand that and just said would it make you happy if we comp;d your safe. By this point we just took it and left to our rooms.I was quite frusturated by this - but i decided it wouldnt ruin my trip. The rest of the time there was pretty uneventful except for the crews and constructions on the outside of the building with a lot of noise. Oh also our air conditioner worked half the time and was reset to subzero by the maid daily (talk about top quality service). The shower head fell down on our heads every time we showered (i should of asked for another room but i was not ready to deal with management again.the sheets were dirty when we arrive with other peoples hair and crumbs in it. The sheet smelled old old - like the room wasnt used in ages - saved for special expedia customers.The pillows are super thin - you need at least 2 of them to sleep.the drywall was falling down, water stain on the ceiling of the room, tiles had a lot of mould in them, and tiny rooms.The breakfast was powder juice, coffee ( i didnt try) and powdered/plain donuts. Cheap with flies buzzing and landing all over it.nope - dont recommend it - even to a buget traveler. I have stayed 4 times in waikiki - the ohana waikiki surf and ohana west were MILES above this hotel and not to mention closer (barely) to the beach. Miramar is a nice hotel too - but i didnt feel like spending that much money (110 US a night)Hope this helps!

<Content>Never again I did a lot of homework before booking at the Waikiki Sand Villa. A lot of it had to do with reading the reviews. Sadly, it wasn't enough. I even called the hotel directly and they had very little information. Well, I too booked thru Expedia...great rate it's true. But the room is so small that it's hard to even get our baby stroller in and the parking is the worst possible. Every day for 6 nights we had to double park and leave our key at the front desk. The parking lot is sooo small that you see lots of car scrapes on the walls. The rooms really need a makeover and the sheets and towels are so old they should be thrown away. We weren't told about the free daily breakfast so we never tried it. The internet access is located int he Bar which is super smoky and stinky...1/2 the time the computers were down which was a real bummer. We were depending on them to use for directions, etc. On their website they say if you stay 4 or more nights you can get a Aloha Dining card...however, when I asked for it the girl said it's only if you book thru the hotel website...otherwise it doesn't matter if you stay a month. I'd say the best think about the hotel is if you buy a drink at the Bar and ask, they'll give you 2 tickets to the Honolulu zoo. (It's advertised on the hotel tv channel, not advertised in the bar.) Never again.

<Content>Don't know if I'll stay there again. We were visiting family on Oahu and so we stayed at the Sands Villa twice. The first time was great, we had a corner room facing the mountains and a view of the ocean. The room was just lovely and probably was just refurbished. The free breakfast is nothing to write home about but we liked the room and the pool. So we decided to stay there again the next time we visited the island. YUCK!! What a totally different experience!! We got a room facing the other hotel with the noisy, smoky bar below us. The room was horrible - musty, old, decrepit, just plain terrible. I asked the front desk person why this time our room was so awful (It was like staying at a totally different hotel!!!) compared to the first time we stayed there. He just shrugged and I asked if it had to do with how we booked the room. The first time we booked through the hotel's website and then the next time since it was $10 per night cheaper we booked through Expedia. He said yeah that's why. He wasn't going to give us another room. I'm not sure if I want to stay there again if we get those crappy rooms again. Too bad they treat repeat customers so shabbily. They may not get our business again.

<Content>reviewers must have been somewhere else I am sitting in the in the internet room, and just reread the reviews of this hotel; where were they, not here. hotel is in desperate need of a cleaning and refurbishing, and it would be nice to add ac to the rooms... I complained about the heat, and was told someone would repair... luckily it's cool at nigfht, so sleeping with the sliding door open at least makes the room bearable.. found the hotel not worth the discounted $55 rate, especially compared to the Ohana hotels here which are comparably priced but clean and nice.. I would not recommend anyone expcept those looking to saty as cheaply as they can to book here.... find somewhere else.....

<Content>Really good value I am writing this from our hotel room where my family and I are still currently on our 3rd day here and will be checking out 5 days from now. Tripadvisor played a big part in our decision to stay here. I booked the Deluxe room on the internet. So far - we love it - it is great value. We are on the westside 9th floor and we have a great view of the northern waikiki mountains, canal and golf course. I can imagine the north-side corner rooms to have a great view. The lanai is fairly large and we have breakfast there every morning. The interior looks a bit worn but not too bad. We havent tried the free breakfast. The internet high-speed works great and the staff are friendly. If I have any bad experiences from now til we check out, I will write about it here again.

<Content>a solid value As you may be able to see from my profile, I'm currently living in Hawaii attending UH. I can tell you from personal experience that the Sand Villa is a real value. I've personally stayed there twice, and my parents (who aer VERY picky) stayed there for 10 nights and LOVED it! Here is the rundown:1) Free parking--will save you money! As others have mentioned, the parking garage is VERY small and not for the faint of heart. A bit annoying, but a money saver.2) Good location--Block and a half from the international marketplace, and 3 or 4 blocks from the beach.3) FREE internet! HOok up in the room, or use the computers in the lobby *bar*4) Great happy hour specials--cheap drinks and food, albeit amongst some *ahem* interesting clientele! IT's fun though!5) Of course, low pricesAnyway, the drawbacks are, as you know by now, the small parking garage, the TERRIBLE breakfasts, the cold pool, occasionally noisy clientele, and the very old buildiong which looks rundown in places, and the smokey bar downstair (a problem for my ashmatic mom...but cool for me and my dad who caught lots of football games there!)A BIG tip: request a corner room, preferably one with a 1 at the end--801, 901, etc. Those are mauka or mountain rooms--closer to the mountains and facing the stream. THey are UNQUESTIONABLY better than the rooms on the other side of the hotel, and are a good 10 degrees cooler. Seriously request one. Enjoy your stay in Hawaii!!

<Content>this place grows on you --As an avid review reader, I poured over things people said before I booked on the Sand Villa (Jan 10-15th) web site . I have stayed at my range of hotels from bare bones Motel 6 in Carlsbad, CA to the Kea Lani in Maui. For the price this hotel delivers. You get free parking which is otherwise about $8 per day. You also get some coupon book if you book 4 days. The book has good deals on food if you are two people or more bec there is a lot of 2 for 1's. Anyway, my expectations weren't high, I knew the carpet was worn, etc. but I wanted the free high speed in the room and a nice pool. The pool is nice, not heated so it was cold in January. There was sun on the deck from at least 10am - 4pm. There is a hot tub too. Breakfast was convenience style packaged powered donuts. A definite miss. There were toasting bread one day and had jam. The parking garage is under the hotel and is made for small cars with good turning radiuses. I did see mini-vans down there but there are pillars to dodge and I needed to do 8 point turns to get my mid-size chevy breeze out sometimes. The lot fills at night and you have to double park and leave your keys at the desk. Other than that the parking was a plus in that area of town. It took me 7 minutes to walk to the beach and that includes getting stopped at two stop lights. Very easy walk. I was never a beach person but since the pool was so cold I ventured out and got a $3.00 raft that the store inflated and enjoyed the ocean. It was warm, the sand was great. --The first room I got (a corner) seemed ok, it was clean. Upon further inspection, the shower head was mounted in a way that did not allow you to move it so it shot straight down. Then the air conditioning did not work. The pillows were a bit flat but lets face it - it is not a a five star. At first I chalked it up the you get what you pay for but the second day it was just too hot in the room. I got another room on the 10th floor and it was so much better! Great shower, good air, it even looked newer. I was told that my new floor was a no smoking floor. The hallway carpet is more worn on all floors than the carpet in the rooms - who cares, you don't live in the hallway. The hotel was redeemed. Lesson - if you don't like your room change it right away, call ahead and ask the hotel to check the room for a good working shower, clean smells, and air conditioning. Really, call, that is what the front desk told me to do for my next visit. Have some check your room. I had no trouble with the noise but given it is on a busy corner people who have noise issues may want a room away from the street or up high.-- While I was there, for the benefit of my posting back to this list, I asked to see one of the Pualeilani Studios. They were much bigger with a kitchenette and table, sofa, and a bigger bathroom. If you need the space it is nice. A fridge would be great. There are no elevators so it might not be fun on the higher floors if you don't like the hike. The hotel also has a hospitality room which I check out. It is great if you arrive early or have a late flight. There are two full bathrooms, with towels, etc if you want to take a shower, there are couches, a big tv, internet access, it seemed like the size of two hotel rooms - great if you need a place to hang or change. There are washers and dryers (for a small fee) if you need to wash clothes. The laundry room seemed clean and acceptable when I peeked in. I did not eat at the hotel but there were clusters of Sand Villa groupies enjoying the food. There is a pool table, bar, and computers in the lobby to use. The bar has a big screen TV and people were hanging out there too. I had a corner room which was looking at the canal and it was very pretty. - The hotel staff was helpful but I didn't learn anyone's name. They responded to my requests. I even had to e-mail after I left bec I forgot my receipt and they mailed me one right away. There is an activity desk but I didn't use it. I am going back in February because buy the time my fourth day came I knew my way around, had a better room, a place to park, high speed internet in my room that just worked when I plugged my network cable in (they have some at the desk). My cell phone even worked better in Honolulu than in the Bay Area. For the price it meets all my needs.

<Content>A nice place Our stay in Sand Villa is plesant. The best thing we loved is its free hi-speed internet - it makes life so much easier. We booked through a travel agency since this is our first time to Hawaii. I guess we paid a little more than average but we were happy about its location and the staff were really nice. Many customers come from Japan and they have a small Japanese eatery in the lobby. I also love the pool. The only thing I dislike is the place is a little worn and old, especially the carpet and some bed clothing.
