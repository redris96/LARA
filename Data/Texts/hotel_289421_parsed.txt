<Content>Lovely little hotel Stayed here with my Mum for 3 nights in April. It was easy to get to from the airport on the underground. Rooms are a little on the small side but stylish and clean. We didn't have breakfast included but there is a bakery next door which was lovely. There is also a Tapas restaurant opposite and its the best Tapas place I have ever been too.

<Content>Location Loctaion Location It's all about location with this hotel... right on the Puerta del Sol. Countless restaurants,tapas bars, bars nightclubs... narrow little streets and beautiful squares all within a 2 min walk! Hotel is fine , I wouldn't say 4* superior ... rooms clean, bathrooms funky. Ask for a room on the 7th floor as they all have balconies. Breakfast poor, unless it's in with the rate don't bother with it. Staff courteous and helpful. In all a very pleasant stay... try Fatigas restaurant- out the main building and take the alley to the right of the main road a meal for 2 and a bottle of Rioja comes in at under 30 Euro.. fantastic staff and beautiful old restaurant. Have fun!

<Content>Decent Stay, Good Location My sister and I visited in May '08. We stayed 2 nights in Madrid after a week along the Costa del Sol. The Quo is very centrally located, just steps from the hustle and bustle of the Puerta del Sol and a nearby metro station. The room was spacious and clean, and the bed was comfy. However, I did not like the bathroom nearly as much. While it was very modern and streamlined, there was a bit of mold around the edge of the shower/tub...eeekkk!!! This is a huge pet peeve of mine. I MUST have a CLEAN bathroom, and if there was one small thing I have to fault this hotel for...it was the cleanliness of the bathroom. But, with that said, it was still a nice stay and we appreciated the choice we'd made to stay there. The hotel staff was very friendly, nice and helpful. They spoke English extremely well and answered our questions with ease.

<Content>Great Location I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights 3-5 May 2008 and chose the hotel because of it's central location as we did not want to be spending time having to get into the centre by bus or metro. There were 3 of us sharing one room which was very spacious, on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel. The beds were very comfortable (i like a hard mattress), we had 3 windows in our room so it felt very light and airy and we had great views of the city. We didn't use the tv or internet as we literally only slept in the room and were out all day and evening. The bathroom was a good size and plenty of space for 3 people to put their things (i have stayed in many hotels with tiny bathrooms). As other reviewers have said, the bathroom door is a bit strange and it could be a bit awkward if you are sharing the room with someone you don't know very well. The air con was the quietest i have ever know which was good. On the Saturday night there was alot of noise from outside (we heard nothing from other guests staying in the hotel) due to the central location and there seemed to be people partying out in the street all night! I imagine our second night, the Sunday, would have been much queiter but Real Madrid won a big football match and the city partied all night!! I was so tired from all the sightseeing and lack of sleep from the night before though, I slept through it!Our price did not include breakfast but the cafe nextdoor, Hontanares, does great snacks, fresh orange juice and cappaccinos. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful and i would recommend this hotel for its great location but if you like your sleep and are staying over a weekend you may prefer to request a room at the back of the hotel.

<Content>Fine hotel in excellent location We were a group of about 15 couples (the entire company plus partners) staying at the hotel. The booking was done by the person responsible for the trip and it was chosen mainly for its extremely convenient location.And it certainly is in a great place: Just a very short walk from where things happen in Madrid 鈥?and only two minutes by foot to the nearest metro station (Sevilla), about five from the bigger Sol metro station.The hotel was reported as recently refurbished, which could explain why, in some areas, it did appear as if this work had not yet been finished 鈥?and the rest looked almost new.The rooms were rather small and awkward, but generally quite comfortable. The beds were good-sized, though a tad on the hard side. The AC unit worked fine and did not make too much noise.The bathroom was fairly big and fitted with a bath. It was also fitted with a bidet and quite a bit of extra space. I would personally take out the bidet and rearrange things, giving more space to the actual room. There was no real door to the bathroom: A frosted glass pane mounted on hinges but with a one-inch gap all the way around has been put in its place. So much for privacy in the bathroom.Unfortunately, water saving taps had been fitted and it took almost an entire morning to fill the bath. The shower also gave out very little water, which was somewhat annoying.Internet was available in the room, but in many rooms this was available through cable only. Even when using cable, you would have to get an access code from the reception to actually access the network, and this would be valid for a single computer only. it was free 鈥?but the hassle of obtaining access codes on a daily basis was unnecessary.There was a rather well-stocked minibar as well as a TV set with a very limited amount of channels in English (only one or two, in fact).The breakfast was fine with a decent selection of hot and cold items, including a large selection of savouries. Unfortunately, we were not available to enjoy this on all days of the stay due to the breakfast room simply beeing way too small.The staff were friendly enough, but the level of service is not impressive. In fact, it was my general impression that service-mindedness is not very common in Madrid, and this hotel was no exception.Even though there are quite a few really good things to say about the hotel, the few bad things end up dragging it down to the average level overall. Depending on your needs and requirements, your own experience may be better or worse.

<Content>Excellent hotel, great location. This hotel is in a really good location. Everywhere was easily walkable. We bought a 5 day metro pass and only used it to get from the airport to the hotel and back again as it was to easy to walk everywhere. Plaza Santa Ana and Puerta del Sol were each only a 5 min walk away with Plaza Mayor not much further.Reception staff were very helpful and friendly and spoke good English.The room was not very large but was well decorated, very modern and clean and our request for an extra pillow was dealt with promptly. The room was well soundproofed. You do need to be on good terms with your room mate as the bathroom door is smoked glass and its design is not close fitting.We had breakfast as part of a good deal but would say it is not worth the 鈧?7 charged. There is a very nice cafe right nextdoor (Hontanares) which does a selection of breakfasts and lovely cakes ( try the Torrijas).

<Content>Great Modern, Clean Hotel We are used to travelling around the world and staying in all sorts of accommodations. We found this hotel to be excellent for the price range. It was clean, friendly, modern (I don't mean the 1980's modern). The staff were friendly and the location was excellent, walking distance to everything, and not noisey at night. If you get tired of tapas, there's a great restuarant across the road that does not take bookings but always full (and extremely well priced).

Big rooms, crew always available to help, near to restaurants and other attractions.Good the continental breakfast, but no possibility to have lunch or dinner.

<Content>Ok hotel, great location Stayed at Quo for one night mid October. It is an OK hotel at a decent price (Madrid's hotels are all on the pricey side), but rooms are just tiny and the walls are paper thin. I could listen to my neighbour's TV and doors shutting and people walking in the corridor. I would stay there again, if only for a night or two, not for a longer stay.

<Content>Location makes it work Stayed here for 3 nights in September, my second stay at this property in one year. I returned to this hotel due to its decent value for central Madrid - 98EUR - and fantastic location.This hotel is NOT without its issues, however. Among them: - hallway noise can be murderous at 2am when you are trying to sleep; doors seem to be thin- sunblinds did not operate so could not open the window- wireless internet, while free, does not quite permeate the entire hotel meaning some rooms are without- the elevator is on the slow side of, well, slow- the lights in my bathroom went out early one afternoon - maintenance gone until tomorrow- air-con went out later - maintenance gone for the day, will not be fixed until tomorrow- the showerhead was broken and sprayed sideways only; maintenance never fixed it- i know it is funny, but there was only one partial roll of toilet tissue and it ran out on first afternoon; housekeeping did not replenish for duration of stay even after I left a note, in Spanish- getting a taxi from the hotel is hit or miss - if they call, it takes 15-20 minutes and cost extra- we had two rooms reserved, on the hotel's website, under the same name. Upon arrival, one had been cancelled as they thought it was a duplicate and they tried to tell us they were 100% full. After a bit of friendly arguing (no voices raised or anything), they reinstated the booking as it was made and gave us the two rooms, albeit on completely opposite floors (floors 1 and 7).- many things in the room are broken - cabinet doors, the desk chair, sunblinds, lights...In short, the staff are friendly enough and try hard, but they seem overwhelmed easily when simple things are asked of them (like more toilet tissue, or bathroom lights repaired). For the money and location, this hotel is still a decent value - but if you're willing to spend a bit more, MUCH better options exist.

<Content>Lovely spot, great location, good rates for madrid Booked 2 nights here after much searching for a good hotel at reasonable prices in Madrid. The location is excellent for touring the city, the room soundproofing is excellent as its on a busy street and staff could not have been more helpful or friendly.Rooms were lovely and modern and well equiped. Hotel is well laid out, breakfast (expensive at 15 euro) was good and all staff excellent. When planning the trip, I found it very difficult to find a high standard hotel for a reasonable price so decided to try 2 different hotels over a 5 day trip. We had spent the previous 2 nights in the Tryp Ambassador which was pretty awful.Would recommend the Quo!

<Content>Very good location and price. This hotel was in an excellent area, right next to Fran Via, and the Capitol Building. It was a short walk from Puerta Del sol, considered the centre of the city. It was near excellent restaurants such as: De Finka Susana, it was 5 star quality food for extremly cheap prices. Also near an internet cafe.The lobby was quite small and simple.The concierge were friendlyThe room was quite large and modernDownside was that a building next door was getting renovated, so there was loud noise, the corridors had constant music playing, after listening to the girl from ipanema 50 times it got quite annoying, even at 11pm.The Architecture of the buildings near hotel Quo was amazing, the true madrid. It was also a 5 minute walk to the Plaza Mayor.It was the best value hotel I visited in europe, half the price of all the other hotels.This place was excellent.Last thing: there are no channels in english, so don't expect to be entertained television unless you can speak spanish.

<Content>Great location, spoilt by details We had a 2 night stay at the Quo in May. We chose it from reviews here and because of its' location at the edge of the Old Town.It was perfect for walking to all the must see sites but also 100 metres from the Madrid Vision tour bus routes. We walked both mornings and did the red and blue routes each afternoon.We had a fabulous meal at La Terrace in the Casino de Madrid. We had the degustation menu and the food and service were out of this world. It is only 200 metres from the hotel.We booked the superior double room on the top floor which has a roof terrace with great views over the neighbouring roof tops. On the Sunday night there was a thunder storm and the lightning was spectacular.The room was quiet at night and the twin beds were comfortable.We paid extra for an acceptable breakfast but agree there are plenty of places close by that are much cheaper.Problems in the room that let the hotel down were:the blind at the french window onto the terrace would not wind all the way up preventing the door opening properly;one of the sunloungers was broken;there was a trouser press but nowhere to plug it in to;there was a faulty light on the desk;I pre-ordered champagne to be delivered on our first night as a surprise - it was forgotten.Because it was a weekend nothing was fixed until the Monday morning we were leaving. It is not good enough for a 4* hotel to have such defects in the room. No reduction was made to the bill.Recommended because of its' location.

<Content>Excellent Location/Perfect Trip I planned a family trip to Madrid to celebrate my husband's birthday. Our daughter flew in from LA to join us on a flight from Newark. Unfortunately for my son in college, he couldn't join us. I checked numerous travel books and read countless reviews to find the best hotel for us in Madrid and I found it. It's excellent location allowed us to walk to Plaza de Santa Ana for the tapas bars, to Prado and other museums, to the Sol, Plaza Mayor, Gran Via and the Opera. We took the metro to Palacio Real and Serrano just for the ride. It is truly a central location and yet you don't have the throngs of pedestrians at your doorstep. It was quiet enough but not too quiet. Tip #1: If you will have an early arrival, email the hotel to request an early check-in. Our room was available in half-hour of checking in. Tip #2: Walk to the Sol and purchase water, soda and snacks at El Corte Ingles supermarket at the basement instead of indulging in treats from the mini-bar. Tip #3: Skip the hotel breakfast for 15 euros. The Cathedral restaurant is on the way to the Sol for a full sit-down breakfast for 5 euros. The Museo del Jamon was great for midnight snacks. The hotel staff may not be the friendliest but they are very helpful. I have been all over Europe all these years and this first trip to Madrid has made it my favorite European city.

<Content>disappointing lobby..... I stayed at this hotel for four nights in mid-March. The room was quite small, but clean and well-maintained. The bathroom was accomodating by American standards, but small. The lobby was little more than a hallway in front of the check in desk. It was not very inviting. Our room faced the main street, and rowdy crowd noise went on until almost 4 AM on several nights.... The room does not include breakfast, and several small breakfast places are within one hundred feet of the hotel door. The best feature of the hotel was its location in the tourist area of the center of Madrid. It was about a 10-15 minute walk to the three major museums and the Atoycha train station. There was also a Metro stop very close to the hotel.  The hotel gives the feel of being in the heart of the city, and the neighborhood felt very safe day and night. However, if your looking for a grand lobby  sort of hotel, then keep looking.

<Content>Great location We have just returned from a weekend at Quo. I liked the hotel and found the staff friendly and helpful some more than others.The location was great however i am a very light sleeper and was woken many times by street noise . The beds were really comfortable but i hated the bathroom door which was frosted glass and a swing door. The room was small but clean and modern. There were six of us altogether the others were not bothered by street noise or the bathroom door so different for everyone. What worries me is that we paid 鈧?01 each so that was 鈧?02 for one room for two nights not including breakfast seems expensive to me but maybe this is the price for this time of year!

<Content>Tiny but comfortable Location was terrific - however, beware of noise as this is a very busy intersection. Also, ambient smells from neighbouring restaurant wafting into room in the evening and night hours made it difficult to sleep.The hotel staff were cooly efficient and helpful to a point - their knowledge seemed to end at the front door of the hotel. The evening of our arrival we were looking for advice on a place to eat, and none was offered - (we discovered later that there were a handful of good restaurants right around the corner!)Rooms are very small for 2 people - beware - but well appointed and comfortable. Comparable to a boutique hotel in New York City, size and price-wise.

<Content>mmmm, doughnuts I stayed here for five nights in November and would definitely stay again. Great location for a start, especially if you are focused on visiting the Prado. Had read reviews on this site saying it was 20-30 mins walk from the museum, but it only ever took us 15 minutes max to get to the northern entry. And it was usually only 10 mins. What made the stay extra extra special however, were the breakfasts. When they ask you in the breakfast room Tea, coffee, or orange juice?, whatever else you want get the juice as well. They squeeze it fresh and it is the best I've ever tried. The perfect bright-tasting start to the day. And don't even get me started on the mini chocolate doughnuts they also have .... delicious.  However DO check when you check in whether your breakfast is included - I assumed ours was, but then we got the bill on checking out. Worth it, definitely, but would have been nice to know in advance. Also, the hotel's own website says it offers room service - they don't actually mean this in the English-speaking sense, though. Turns out it means the rooms are serviced!  And I want to reiterate the tip given by a previous reviewer - there is something about the design of the beds that means you are constantly stubbing your toe on the base. The advice of taking off the bolster pillows and using them as a protective barrier at the feet of the bed ended up saving us a lot of agony. One more thing - if you hate light-filled rooms, take a sleeping mask. While the bedroom itself has a good black-out curtain, the bathroom has just a shade that lets in a lot of light from the street - which would be no problem except that the bathroom door is just misted glass, so it kind of glows like a giant night-light the whole night. But these were minor things - we had a great stay, found the staff really friendly, and they didn't mind us filling the minibar fridge with snacks bought from the supermarket in the basement floor of the El Corte Ingles department store, just up the street in the Plaza del Sol. Will definitely be the place we always go back to stay when we're in Madrid.

<Content>Stay Away from This Hotel!!!!!!! Do Not Stay Here We stayed at this hotel in November for a 3 night stay. We booked on their website back in July and were confirmed for a DOUBLE room and gave both names of the guests that would be in the room. We were given an email confirmation confirming the rate. When we arrived for our stay, we were told that the rate would be higher by 40 Euros for an extra person charge. BEWARE!!!!!! This hotel is not honest. OUr confirmation clearly stated 2 people would be in the room and the room was quoted to be a double room. The manager is condescending and rude.It is a very NOISY hotel. with alot of noise coming from the street and the noise travels easily from room to room since it is poorly constructed. The housekeepers make alot of noise in the mornings, slamming doors and laughing outside of guest rooms. The rooms are also very small with very little light. There are so many other hotels in the area that you can stay at. DO NOT STAY HERE.

The hotel is boutiquey. The staff is overall helpful. Nice breakfast in the morning. Pretty good rate at 140 euros (included breakfast for 2). Room is very trendy we had sitting area and balcony with seating.Best part although close to everything was relatively quiet.

Not only is it in a perfect location, but I thought it was very well staffed and had pleasant rooms. The only problem I had was the water wasn't very hot in my shower and there can be some noise in the hallways. This hotel would be perfect for a single traveler or a couple.

<Content>Good, solid value and location Puerta Del Sol is a great hotel in the midst of Madrid, within easy walking distance of nearly everything you will want to do and see. There's a metro stop less than 1 block away, you're less than 15-20 minutes on foot from the Prado, Plaza Mayor, the Cathedral, the grand park, and everything else in Central Madrid. The hotel is not cheap, but it's not over-the-top expensive either. We had a great room on the top floor with a nice outside patio (although not much a view due to other taller buildings surrounding us). My only complaint was at check-in. We were arriving from the US and knew we would be at the hotel early in the morning. I had specifically emailed and called ahead to alert them of our exact arrival time. They confirmed via email and on the telephone that an early check-in would not be a problem.....and of course, it was. We arrived at a little after 9:00am in the morning after overnight travel and the front desk staff knew nothing of my previous conversations or the hotel's approval. It took a couple of conversations and some waiting, but everything eventually worked out all right. Personally, I think the on-site staff could have been a lot more friendly and understanding and accommodating while we stood there with our luggage, but maybe I was just tired and frustrated. It was just an unfortunately start to our trip and a bad first impression of an otherwise very nice hotel.

<Content>As advertised....... I just returned from a five night stay at the Quo and it was exactly as it appears in the website. I was traveling alone and had a room on the top floor (704) that was big enough for two, with a desk, two chairs, TV, mini bar, electronic safe, trouser press, double bed and a spacious bathroom with tub, shower and hairdrier. This room did not have a terrace, but did have two windows and faced a side street off Calle Sevilla. There was plenty of closet space but no dresser, just shelves in the closets. Total cost of the room, with tax for five nights and with breakfast on two days was 745 euros or about 150 euros per night - a very nice deal considering the quality of the hotel and the superb location. You could eat at a different good restaurant every day for a month without leaving the immediate area and a couple of nice places are right next door.  Madrid itself is a fun city with a nice combination of culture and nightlife. If you do not speak Spanish take the time to learn a few basic phrases and the names of a couple of tapas and your experience will be greatly enhanced. Spend at least one evening strolling the Gran Via, the pedestrian streets off the Puerta del Sol and/or the tapas scene between the hotel and Plaza Santa Ana. Only Via Corso in Rome compares for people watching.

<Content>nice, but overrated. My partner and I stayed here for a three night long weekend at the end of September 2006. We chose this hotel based on the location and the great reviews on this site.The hotel is nice, and there is no doubt that it is a great location. However, I don't think it is quite as good as some of the other reviewers say. Service is fine, but not particularly friendly or remarkable. But what was really lacking was the little things that you would expect when paying over 拢125 per night. Things like fixing the wonky toilet, and replenishing the toiletries when they are fully used up, without having to ask. Our room on the second floor wasn't too noisy, but it is showing its age, with scuff marks on the walls and general wear and tear prevalent throughout.In summary, it is a nice hotel, but I think it is way overpriced for what you get. Shop around for similar hotels at better rates before booking here.

<Content>loved the location We have just returned from a lovely long weekend in Madrid.The hotel was very well situated although a little noisy. This is only to be expected from a city centre hotel. The rooms were well decorated and spotlessly clean although friends that we travelled with were disapointed with their room (104) as it was very small with no wardrobe space. Ours was fine, plenty of room. We were a little amazed at the hotel bar!! It was a tea trolley with drinks on it. We like to meet in the bar before we enjoy a night out. I would stay at this hotel again because of its great location.

<Content>Top location - good hotel The hotel was very clean, our room was fine but a little on the small side. Useful extras in the bathroom such as toothbrush, shaving kit, comb. Sound proofing could have been better, but if you intend to live as the Madridians do then you should be out there living it up till the small hours anyhow. So the noise shouldn't be a problem. Suggest a room at back of the hotel if you are a light sleeper. Room decor exactly as website and beds/pillows extremely comfortable.The location of this hotel in our opinion was the best, there are 2 metro stations very close by - Sevilla and Puerta Del Sol. Comfortable walking distance to most key places if you want to do the touristy thing. Great bar/restaurant called Catedral just as you walk down to the Sol plaza - food very nice and reasonable. Did the Real Madrid tour - 9 euros each, good value trophy rooms very good. Palace definitly worth a visit and if you have good weather the Reitro park is very nice for chilling out. We were in Madrid for 4 nights, and felt we needed much longer - will return and will stay at the same hotel.

<Content>Not all it is cracked up to be... We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by 2 reception staff who were to engrossed in their own conversation to stop and talk to us for a good long while! We were then asked our room preferences as we checked in, would we like one or two beds, smoking or non-smoking, only to be told the choices we made were unavailable, which begs the question why they bothered to offer us something we couldn't have! The room was quite nicely decorated with a modern look, and the nice addition of a small balcony, but the decor looked tired, the paint work was marked and it needed freshening up. The bathroom was the worst- when you sat on the toilet it rocked and did not seem to be secured to the floor properly and the button for the flush did not work properly and often the top needed lifting off the toilet to be able to flush! The bed was very comfortable though. Strangely enough this was the only hotel during our trip to Spain which did not offer us a customer comments form at checkout!! Overall an ok hotel, nice location, but a little shabby around the edges and certainly not one I would class as luxury.

<Content>fantastic location, great rooms This hotel is in a central location. Close to everything. Rooms were spacious, clean  very modern. One of the best rooms we stayed in on our 6 week tour of Europe. Free internet also a bonus.Staff a bit vague but do their job.Madrid is a great city.

<Content>Nice boutique hotel Excellent little hotel with nice design touches. The pictures on trip advisor are very accurate so when you arrive, it feels like you've been there. Also, the location is superb and is close to all the sites. Very clean with nice wood floors and the staff is pleasant and helpful. Overall, highly recommended.

<Content>Great hotel, great location We spent 3 nights at the Hotel Quo from 22 to 25 June 2006. It is a lovely, stylish boutique hotel in an excellent central location. Our room was quiet even though it looked out on to quite a busy street. The bathroom was modern and smart and the shower was good. There's no problem with the glass door to the bathroom if you're worried about privacy. It was frosted and was tucked around a corner anyway.The staff were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was included in our room rate and was fantastic - the waitress squeezed our orange juice from fresh oranges as we sat down each morning.The hotel is perfectly located near to the main shopping area around Puerta del Sol, but is also within walking distance of other attractions such as the Prado Musuem and the Salamanca district.We looked around on the internet before booking and found a good deal. I thought it was very reasonably priced. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I return to Madrid.

<Content>Great hotel w/a location that can't be beat!! I just got back from an amazing trip to Spain which included 3 nights at Quo Puerta del Sol (in Madrid) and 3 nights at another hotel in Barcelona. Quo was by far my favorite hotel on the trip. It was clean, pretty spacious for European standards (we had a small flat screen t.v., a queen size bed, a nice sized bathroom and so forth). The glass doors were not a problem at all, as they are very frosted, and the location simply CANNOT BE BEAT! All in all, it was great! I'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great place! Great Hotel !!!. Extremely well located, in the middle of everything that should be visited in Madrid. The staff was quite helpful, and the rooms not as small as I expected after reading previous reviews. Maybe I was lucky, but my room was big enoug. The modern furniture (with an LCD TV) was lovely. And breakfast was excellent. To sum up, I stay in 16 4 stars hotels during my Spain trip, and I would definitely put this hotel in the top three.

<Content>Best Location We could Find Finding a hotel on line and booking is always questionable. Especially if you have never been to the city and have no idea what might be a good location.We were lucky. This hotel is located within walking distant of everything tourist come to see. The rooms were small but very clean.Loved the location and at a very reasonable price. This is a place we would recommend to our friends or anyone else visiting Madrid.Taking the big red double decker bus to view the city was also a great way to become aquainted with the city.

<Content>Highly recommended Staff were superb, room was excellent - calm, cool and sophisticated. Location is perfect - you can walk everywhere from here. We booked through Exedia and had a room on the side road (quieter than the main road) with a small balconette. Frosted glass door to the bathroom may disquiet those who are not very good friends!Take care if changing money in the area - we were caught out without Euros on the Thursday before Easter, when all banks are closed. Don't go to the Exact Change in Puerto Sol - they have appalling rates. We have made a formal complaint to Madrid council after''losing 拢35 in a transaction to convert 拢200 into euros. We later found out that the kiosk near the hotel is far more reasonable. The hotel staff were horrified at what had happened.Nearest metro is Sevilla, not Sol. Plenty of restaurants nearby, especially in Chueca, 5 mins to the north.

<Content>Great Location My wife and I stayed here (143 Euro) as well as Hotel Bauza (169). The Quo has a far better location. The standard room at Bauza was a little bigger so if you are spending a lot of time in the room or need a bigger room...Quo had a better location (next to shopping. night life and museums) and also had a friendlier desk staff (Bauza is in a more pretentious neighborhood). Rooms are as advertised--clean n modern-n some have a view of the plaza nearby.

<Content>Great hotel! Loved the place. Ended up in the room directly over the front door. Pretty much exactly like the sample pics of a room on the hotel's own website. The black, white and accent red colors, with sleek furniture, were beautiful. Very nice toiletries. Including a toothbrush/toothpaste and razor/soap along with the standard shampoo and soap options. For Americans who simply can't stand to go without their Starbuck's, there is one only a block away. Personally, I prefer the local coffee options, but there you go.Walking to Sol is an easy five minutes, mainly downhill. Managed to walk to the Prado in under a half an hour, from the hotel. The Seville metro stop, only a block away, can get you anywhere you need to go.Do not miss: the royal palace, the Artes ticket (available at the Prado, Reina Sophia and Thyssen art museums, offering a package deal on admission to all three museums) and (if you can afford it) dinner at La Terraza ( --------- ) only a block away. Seriously the best meal of my LIFE there. Very experimental Spanish cuisine in a restaurant managed by Ferr谩n Adri脿. Reservations absolutely necessary.But the hotel is a great place with fantastic front desk staff (PERFECT English spoken), very well located and comfortable.

<Content>Very funky!! Picked this hotel having read about it on tripadviser.com. Great value, I think we paid 鈧?20 per night and the location was absolutely superb! The best of Madrid's night life and shopping are just on the doorstep and because it's so buzzy you couldn't but feel safe even very late at night. The room was very clean, well equiped, cool and contempory. I didn't eat there so I can't comment on that. The only disappointing thing was that I faxed the hotel a few days before arrival asking could they organise Real Madrid tickets for my girlfriend and me. When we arrived they had no record of the request but they said they would see what they could do. The folllowing morning they quoted us 鈧?50 each! At that we went out to the Bernabua and got excellent tickets for 鈧?5...other than that the Q gets top marks!!

<Content>great location stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in February. the location as others have said is excellent , almost every museum or shopping area is only around the corner We stayed on the fourth floor and i have to agree that a couple would have to be secure in their relationship to cope with the glass door to the bathroom  the room was lovely and the staff spoke fluent english and there is a taxi rank opposite which is handy for trips to the airport

<Content> Great Hotel I and 27 others (14 couples) stayed here for 2 nights in December 05. I and my friends couldn鈥檛 praise this hotel enough, everywhere clean and tidy; staff so helpful and polite couldn鈥檛 do enough for us. we pre booked breakfast before we went with the agency we used as a lot of firms did not offer this, and must say the breakfast was really first class I only expected the normal cheese. Boiled egg and roll, this had everything you could have wanted. Its self service buffet hot and cold, fresh fruit, fresh jucies, first class. Rooms were art deco style nice and clean and tidy. The position in Madrid was also good near the centre of everything. Only drawback was very slight vehicle noise but nothing to complain about
