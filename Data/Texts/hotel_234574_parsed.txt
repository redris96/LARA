<Content>Don't expect much sleep Don't expect much sleep.The plumbing is noisy  the walls are thin. Doors close noisily.Rooms are small, to use the desk in most rooms, the TV has to be placed on the floor.I have stayed in this hotel three times when I haven't had the choice, (been booked in by clients I have been visiting, on two occasions I have had to ask for a room change, which they complied with.The hotel is in a good location, in the Gothic quarter, short walk to Las Ramblas, beaches, marina.

<Content>Hated Smelly Pit I ended my trip to Spain (Barcelona, Sevilla, Granada, Barcelona) with a night at the Hotel Laietana Palace. It was a trip planned by my husband as a birthday gift.This Palace was miserable, smelly pit. The staff was rude when we check-in. When I asked to speak to a manager, they handed me an internal hotel review which would probably be thrown out.When we asked about an early breakfast because we had an early flight back to New York, we were informed that they could not accomodate us. We had already paid for two full American Breakfast in the room rate. We were only requesting coffee and toast or a piece of pastry. We got nothing; we were offered nothing.Only one of the two elevators was actually working. It took 10 minutes to get to our room.The room was dusty and small. They only provided two towels which were between a bath and a hand towel. There were no bath towels provided. Not to mention the top of the hot water tap was missing.Contrary to the hotel description, here was no air conditioning. The hotel had turned the air conditioning off in the entire building with the exception of the staff and common areas. The temperature was in the mid-70's that evening. We had to open the window (singular) for a little air. The air had a sewery smell to it; I think it was from the water surround the old near by castle. There was noise from the street until 4:00 am. We only slept on the plane ride home. The hotel was suppose to have undergone a recent renovation. Unfortunately, the carpets were torn and dusty and the wall paper faded. I wonder what they had 'renovated.'I would never stay at this hotel ever again. I am recommending that no one else stay at this hotel too.Hope this helps - Please note that I had started my trip (the first three nights in Barcelona) at the Meridian Hotel on Las Ramblas. That hotel was much nicer, newer, cleaner and we had a much better experience at the Meridian. I loved Alahambra; it was magnificent, the hotel in Granada was clean and okay. There weren't many hotels in Granada. I didn't hate Spain, I just hated the LAIETANA PALACE hotel.Everyone should avoid this hotel until they fix the aforementioned problems.

<Content>Excellent location, decent hotel We stayed here for little over a week. The place is very clean, staff are pleasent and helpful, the hotel is deffinitely not a 4 star as was advertised to us but we would stay here again purely for the location. We stayed here during a promotion rate of 鈧?0 a night, so would probably look longer for other hotels if we had to pay full price.On first arriving at the hotel we thought it looked nice, the first room we had was spacious offering a good view. Unfortunately we had to move a few times due to problems in the rooms. One thing we noticed was most rooms are very different in size and layout, im guessing it would be a lottery which one you get. The staff seemed helpful enough so just ask to be moved. We were given a twin instead of double room and there was a problem with the bed in another room. There is also something wrong with the water system in the building, resulting in getting inconsistent water temperature/pressure. You can use the interent downstairs in the lobby for free which is a plus. Breakfast is not included so cant comment on that. Overall we enjoyed our stay in this hotel, it was pretty standard and nothing unexpected happened.

<Content>Good, adequate and well placed hotel but not quite 4* Have just enjoyed 3 nights at the laietana palace. No complaints - we booked a deal through lastminute and expected the worst. The room was small (bathroom huge) and though at the back much quieter than larger rooms at the front so we were happy. Air con/heating fine, comfortable beds and very clean. room safe - no key and Euro news on the TV irritating but otherwise great with very good staff. All newly decorated. If you are flying to Girona and worried about the transit bus, don't be - it's opposite the exit and was 22euros return - dropped us off at Estacio Nord where taxi waiting - fare to hotel 9 euros from there. Don t bother with breakfast - great tapas bar doing excellent coffee etc - go to traffic lights and turn right into back st.Well located for the marina and the cathedral and shops.

<Content>Not as bad as I'd feared Having booked into this hotel for 5 nights over Christmas, I then read the reviews and my heart sank! I hate grotty hotels and with Christmas being a bit special, I was not looking forward to the experience. I did phone before and asked for a nice room and they said they'd see what they could do.I have to say, I was expecting the worst but was relieved to find it wasn't all bad though 4* is a bit of a joke. 2 1/2* would be more accurate. However, our room on the 5th floor rear was adequate and BBC News 24, which is dreadful, was working. The bathroom looked fine but as with other reviewers, we found the shower water pressure erratic and most of the water ended up on the floor.The room, inspite of its height, was quite noisy but no more than I would expect from any city centre location and we managed to sleep well with the windows open every night. Probably all that sight seeing! Didn't try the breakfast so can't comment. Only one lift was working most of the time so getting up and down was a bit slow but once they'd fixed the 2nd lift, all was OK.The desk staff were friendly. All in all, not TOO bad and at about 100 euros a night, it was reasonable value.

<Content>Polite service, but horrible hotel The first room they gave us smelt so strongly of solvent (glue? paint?) that we had to change rooms. The walls in the hotel must be made of paper, I could hear a pin drop in the next room and had to listen to the lift all night. The shower created a pool in the bathroom (bad design)...and why are the rooms so hot?! (Don't open the window unless you want yet more noise!)Oh, and don't try the house wine.All in all, it was nothing like the pictures in the website (different hotel??) and very dissapointing.

<Content>Great location and friendly staff We had been booked into an apartment in the city which we had to vacate in a hurry on our first night in Barcelona as the plumbing broke in the whole block leaving no water and a stench of sewage! The next day my Husband booked this hotel through the local tourist board for our family , and we would have to say that we thought it a sublime oasis.The staff were all extremely friendly -both to the adults and children- and had a very good command of English.The rooms ,at the back on the third floor, although somewhat compact were no more so than many other city centre hotels we have stayed in. They were well appointed and clean with extremely comfortable beds and air conditioning. Lovely bathrooms -although the 2 rooms we had only had showers , but they were good power showers.It was a bit of a shame that the advertised BBC24 was not available, but not the end of the world.Great buffet breakfast with a huge array and variety to choose from until 11am.Yes, there was a bit of outside noise , but no more than any European city in the middle of summer. It certainly didn't disturb us or waken our children. Perhaps it's because our rooms were at the back it was quiter.Would stay again and recommend to friends.

<Content>Nothing to Winge About I have just returned from Barcelona which was brilliant. I had booked the Laietana Palace over the internet and wasn't quite sure of the location having never visiting Barcelona and read mixed reviews was a little unsure. When arriving it took us about 20 min to get from the airport to the Hotel, costing 25 euros!The hotel is on a main street but your won't find many hotels that aren't! The hotel has air conditioning and staff were very friendly on arrival. When arriving at our room we were pleasantly suprised with the size of it (double room).The floor was marble with nice furnishings, overall very clean.The bathroom is also a great size, with toilet, beade, sink and shower and enough room to swing several cats! A little dissapointed there was no bath but shower was great.The hotel is very quiet although if you get a room facing the main road you know when its morning with the sound of traffic waking you. I did not find this much of a problem though. The hotels location is brilliant. A two min walk to the port, restraunts accross the road, gaudi musuem near by, picasso museum near by and La Ramblas is directly behind the hotel with a small walk up to it!We found taxis cheap when lost or in a hurry or legs just too tierd to walk any further, just a few pounds to your destination. Staff at the hotel are really helpful on any information you need. Make sure you check out all the back lanes benhind the hotel, quite interesting!

<Content>Wouldn't Return Overall I was disappointed with this hotel. No hot water from the shower on 2 out of the 5 nights I stayed there. No English speaking TV channels - despite BBC World being listed on the guide it wasn't working. Very small rooms with space for the bed and not much else. I was there on my own- if there were two of you it would seem extremely cramped. The first room I was offered [301] was a joke, the only window looking out into a narrow shaft running through the centre of the hotel, the result being a complete lack of natural light - do not accept any room numbered X01. I was then offered room 103 which, despite overlooking the 4 lane road running past the hotel, at least had some sunlight coming in. On the plus side the hotel is centrally located and clean enough but that's about it. If you're expecting a room resembling that pictured on the website or that the 4* rating somehow corresponds to what might be considered a 4* in the UK then you'll be disappointed.

<Content>Don't panic, we thought the hotel was fine! We took on board some of the tips from the site in requesting a room on a higher floor and were relieved to have a pleasant stay. The hotel is fine and was everything we needed it to be for a city break with friends. Yes, there is some street noise and the shower leaked a bit, but those are the only negatives we experienced. The staff were helpful, breakfast was good and the location is excellent.

<Content>Passable This is one of those boutique hotels where they are so close to getting it right but just fall short. The first room I was given was on the top floor next to the lift motor room. It smelt of bad drains and the internet connection didnt work. They quickly relocated me in an apologetic and friendly manner.Everything worked. The room was small and the window looked over a small light well. Nonetheless it was comfortable and ticked most of the boxes. I was concerned at the colony of ants marching along the bathroom floor but this a hot country and you expect these chaps but perhaps not in a 4 star hotel. The shower was state of the art but the temperature control did not work so you were scalded every other minute and is a disastrous way to start the day. The hotel is on a very busy thoroughfare so the noise factor is high but the availablity of taxis is excellent. The staff were very attentive which was a plus point. Would probably try somewhere on a quieter road the next time.

<Content>Great stay - pleasantly surprised Have read other reviews - but also been to Barcelona a lot. It is a busy city and there will always be noise - whether it is roads or street cleaners in the early hours. This hotel is no different.We got a room on the top floor with windows in the ceiling to get the great Barcelona morning light. The room was a good size, nice bed, good bathroom.The water pressure was low sometimes in the shower and the hot water not scalding - but Barcelona is an old city and all the hotels are doing there bit for the environment (a big thing for Catalonia's government) - so it worked - what else did we need?We had let the hotel know about the birthday that was being celebrated and as we were unpacking a complementary bottle of cava with strawberries was delivered - unexpected and much appreciated! Plus the reception staff wishing Happy Birthday on the day was lovely.Breakfasts were good - the restaurant is spacious and the choice of things huge. The bean to cup coffee machine is a nice touch!We would stay there again - great staff and good service.

<Content>would not return We booked the romantic break weekend as it was our anniversary . Thought the hotel looked good on the website and as it was 4 star hoped would be ok - wish we'd read the reviews before we went', however, we have previously read reviews of places and were pleasantly surprised on arrival. We have never written a bad review before but I must say I was very, very disappointed. The hotel was fairly clean but nothing to write home about, we had a bottle of cava on our arrival and the maid did not remove the glasses from our room for two days . The room was exceptionally small with the double bed against the wall which meant that we had to climb over each other to get out of bed. There was only a shower and no jaccussi bath. The mirror and basin were behind the door and very tight, could not put makeup on or do hair if someone else needed to use bathroom and no mirror above dressing table in room as option. The air conditioning blew warm so had to have the window open at night to let in air, which was very noisy. Did not see a menu for room service so did not use, breakfast was served in the restaurant in the lobby, no windows and the rumble of the underground, not very welcoming, however the breakfast was ok with plenty of choice so that was a plus and served till 11am so you could have a lie in after a night out in Barcelona. The wardrobe was in the wall and even though we only took a small amount of luggage we both could not fit our clothes in, any longer stay and it would be hopeless, there were no further drawers and no real room to put suitcases without tripping over them. The room was very claustrophobic. The staff seemed ok although we did not have much contact, the bar never seemed open and not that welcoming anyway. On paying bill the manager did not even ask if everything had been ok. This was our first trip to Barcelona and we will definately be going back again, the location of the hotel was good and very central for everything, the people are fantastic, the underground nearby and extremely efficient and clean and local food is superb with plenty of places to go and see. However the hotel did mar our experience and we would not return, there are plenty of other hotels which looked fantastic so I think they will be having out custom in future. I would rate this more of a 2 star than a 4 star hotel.

<Content>No problems..... I'd booked this hotel before I read the reveiws on this site....needless to say I was a bit worried! Definitely unfounded though. We were greeted by the most helpful conceirge I've come across, provided with maps and details of places of interest. The room wasn't the biggest I've stayed in, but it was more than comfortable, albeit a bit sparse. We only had a shower, but it was one with 5 individual jets and some serious power behind it! Breakfast was served in the basement and wasn't the most friendliest looking of places, but the food was good and fresh and the choice was great. I think i would have to recommend this hotel. The staff were polite and friendly, the room was perfectly acceptable, the food was good and the location was excellent.

<Content>New Years Eve In Barcelona Booked back in september to stay in the Laietana Palace.. Looking forward to going to Barcelona and staying for the New Year. Checked out some of the comments on trip advisor to see what other people thought of this Hotel. Some were very negative so i decided to phone the Hotel to ask for a nice room. They were so helpful, they gave me room 607 which was really big, i think one of the other reviews had said that this was one of the best rooms in the Laietana Palace, although I didn't requst this room, we was lucky to be alocated it. The Hotel was clean, our room was cleaned everyday, the staff where more than friendly. The location was excellent for what we wanted to do. I would recomend this Hotel to anyone who wants a central location. Try to book room 607 though if you can. We certainly will be staying there again. If you do go try to find a small restaurant called Bliss one of the best meals we had whilst we where there. Barcelona is certainly a City to explore, we had 5 days there and loved every minute of it. You will always get some people who like to moan about Hotels, i can only say what we thought of our room and the staff we met, and i would give it 8 out of 10.

<Content>What I had expected, no problems at all My colleague booked this hotel for me for a business trip, and initially I was pleased, then worried when I read some of the other reviews!However, armed with a few handy hints from other reviewers, I asked for a room on one of the upper floors to avoid the traffic and subway noise. I got room 603. I did hear the subway when I was in the restaurant (in the basement), but I have to say I didn't notice it at all otherwise.The room was pleasant enough with a nice bath and powerful shower and a comfortable bed, although the headboard was fre-standing which meant it kept banging against next doors wall when you got into bed. A quick towel over the top and it was sorted.The English language TV stations were a bit sparse, with only CNN and MTV really useable. Be warned that if you attempt to find them by scrolling up through the list of channels, you'll find the adult channels first, so if you have kids be careful! The channel cuts off after a few seconds and asks for a PIN, so it's not too bad.There *is* air conditioning in the room, but as others have mentioned it is switched off out of season. I tried it anyway, and it blew slightly warm air in, so I shut it off and opened the window!Quite a few power slots available in the room, which was useful for me wih my laptop. The wireless internet service was excellent, and there is an ethernet port in your room if you don't have wireless.I tried the breakfast one morning, and others were right. It *is* overpriced for what it is, but it's optional so you don't have to pay for it. There is a lovely Cappucino bar about 30 yards up the road which will sort you out in the morning for about half the price.Room service was fast and efficient, and the food was very nice.There's a mini bar in your room and it's not locked, so my advice would be to go to the Spar type show a few doors down and get your drinks from there, then put them in the fridge!Evening meals wise, there is a fantastic Tapas bar across the road in the precinct. On the other hand, if you turn left then left again from the hotel, you are less than 5 minutes walk from La Rambla, which has everything you could need (drunk British tourists too in the summer).So given the few niggles, why 4 out of 5? Because it's really not that bad. Yes it's certainly not a 4 star hotel by UK standards, but then I never expected it to be. As a general rule, I subtract one star from *any* Spanish hotel's rating, and it was certainly a good enough UK 3 star hotel. The staff were all polite, smartly dressed and efficient. The location is pretty ideal. I was there on business and it was more than enough for my needs.

<Content>No jacuzzi This hotel advertises a jacuzzi in every room - not true. We booked a smoking room and were given a non-smoking room for the first night. The -01 rooms only have a shower which is only protected on 3 sides so the tiny bathroom gets drenched. The -01 rooms are only really big enough for 1 person and have a close-up view of the other hotel walls. Desperately disappointing except for breakfast and the location.

<Content>Run Away Expedia rated this as a 4 Star Hotel, which is horribly misleading. I wish I had read reviews on this site prior to booking. The hotel is advertised as being newly refurbished with luxurious rooms. The first room we were taken to had only a shower, and barely enough room to set down our bags. It was not newly refurbished by any means. The second room we were shown was again, extremely small, and very hot. I asked why the air conditioning was not on, and was told they turn it off during this time of the year. The small window on the slanted ceiling opened minimally and was of no help. We asked again to be moved to one of their luxurious suites (as advertised on their website) and were told they had no such thing as a suite in that hotel. The only good thing I would say about this hotel is that the manager had enough sense to call Expedia to assist with getting our reservations changed.

<Content>nice place from reading reviews here I asked for a room on uper floors, and no 'windows in the roof thanks' as the photo on the their website shows a claustrophobic-looking room with skylight windows. If you do this you should fare ok. We had a lovely end-room with floor to ceiling windows both sides so nice and light and it was very spacious. I was very pleasantly relieved when I walked in (anticipated a dingy cupboard after reading this site!). The traffic roars by alright but nothing to be heard when windows closed. It is in a great location, couldn't be better, so makes up for minor grubbiness of the room (very minor really as it really was clean and hygienice overall). Didn't bother hotel staff much as tend not to usually, and didn't have breakfast there, but all seemed friendly and nice. Room service is advertised as until midnight but had finished by 10.30 which was a bit of a pain, not sure whehter this is a change as didn't get round to pursuing it with them.

<Content>Adequate for what we needed Just got back from Barcelona and stayed at Eurostars Laietana Palace. It was my hen weekend so 10 of us needed somewhere centraI to stay for 2 nights.I was a little concerned after reading some of the earlier reviews about the size of the rooms and have to say that out of the 5 rooms we had only 2 of them were of a smallish size. The bathroom was very nice and had everything we needed. We had maid service every day and we also used the mini bar which wasn't overly priced.I can honestly say that we never once heard the noise from the underground metro that everyone has been mentioning, however we did stay on the fifth floor so were probably quite lucky in that respect.Overall we were happy with our stay and never felt the need to complain about anything (although if i was to be really picky then the T.V could have done with a few more english channels!)We loved Barcelona, such a great city, and i would recommend this hotel for it's central location.

<Content>One good room? Room 607 is the answer. It's large with patio windows and a private terrace with wooden table and chairs. The walls are high but there is a viewing step and the views are worth it. Sofa and chairs, coffee table, large double bed. Very quiet and private. We were given it cheaply on a weekend deal. The staff were excellent, really friendly and helpful even to the extent of inviting us to join them in the bar for a leaving do. The grouting around the bath needed re-doing and part of the patio floor was covered by a tarpaulin which would have bothered us had we been paying anything like the full rate. Wonderful location - excellent bar serving food on the corner. Did see some of the other rooms and they were small and dark.

<Content>In the closet So, Laietana Palace Hotel it was. 200 euro鈥檚 a night. This had better be good. A hint of what was coming came with the nondescript faces of the front desk. The elevator did not level so I tripped while stepping in. The hall was poorly lit, most certainly half the lumen that were used when the marketing pics were taken. The coloring reminded me of soviet style choices. The ever present Mediterranean watercolor paintings could not conceal the dead artist who decorated this. Before the lift started we felt a rumbling. The metro. Wow, every 3 minutes! from 5 am to 2 pm. Room 403. Door open and...... a bed! A soft 鈥榯abletop鈥?with again a nondescript flat grayish spread. I didn鈥檛 measure it. (hey, how low can you go?) It just fitted the room or should I say 'closet'! Around the bed on 2 of the 4 sides was max 2 foot! space and the feet end had some more but then again it had to hold a minibar, chair, table with TV, internet hub, menu and a comments voucher, all nicely stacked for 鈥︹€?.moving. All you need for a 4 star rating.The bathroom was fitted by the Blind Institute (only in remote India have I seen worse marble tiling, plumbing and carpentry) and most likely the last time they replaced the bathroom kit by was the time they built it. It was full of fungi. Tired of the trip, I took a shower. Alternatively it went from burning hot to freezing cold. Not once but always. Even at full flow!Fire regulations require a floor plan. On the door, I glanced at our room. Everything was there. The elevator, the hall and all the rooms including the beds. Aha! This was a single person bedroom converted into a double! So, this is a management decision and screaming at the front desk won鈥檛 work. I just felt the middle finger of the hotel manager/owner in my face. When passing the elevator we also saw a floor plan and I just wondered why they left out the room details on that one. I now knew why. Too many grinning faces!So, there I was. My wife booked the trip and I really love her. She assumed, and so did I, that a 4 star would safeguard against such 鈥渃lassic rip offs鈥? No such luck. I decided it would not spoil my holiday. I took it like a man and my wife did too. We took a risk and trusted the pictures. This was a write off. I decided I would not have a go at the hotel staff but kick this place where it hurts. Their reviews.Breakfast was in the basement! NO DAYLIGHT! Ever heard of Solatubes? And, yet again, a horrible coloring. What a depressing place. There are plastic coated H-beams with rivets. Why an H beam should have rivets, beats me, but it looked like the high pressure feed hose of a plastic extrusion machine ripped just as the operator was taking a siesta. Granted, the breakfast was OK. 鈥榁ia Laietana鈥? the road on which this hotel is resided, is one of the main arteries of Barcelona. 6 lanes of never ending traffic. Even on level 4 with sound stoppers, sleep was virtually impossible. It could have been prevented easy with double layer glass. Probably too expensive. The only good thing about this place is it鈥檚 location. It鈥檚 close to everywhere and we decided to turn mishap into fortune. It gave us the luxury of hopping to every neighborhood without doing detailed planning. Despite that, Barcelona is a nice place. I like it better than New York, Paris or London. More beauty, more clean and more laid back topped off with a pleasant sun and good food. If this review will keep off 10 potential guests I鈥檒l be laughing my head off. With this birdie, I guess we鈥檙e even, mister hotel manager.

<Content>Tiny room. Bitterly disappointing. Avoid. Booked the Romantic package for a 3 day trip to the city. On arrival was given Room 208 which was absolutely tiny. There was barely enough space to accomodate the double bed and small desk with TV. The wardrobe was also tiny- more of a broom cupboard. The standard of room was barely 3 star and within minutes the harrowing face of disappointment was etched on my partner's face. Tears were not a good start to the romantic package. Staff unable to change room that day but we swapped to room 110 which was a vast improvementin size though was more affected by the regular rumblings of underground trains beneath the hotel. Bathrooms were OK. Enjoyed the jacuzzi.Fantastic location adjacent to the Latin quarterPublic parking nearby.Mediocre breakfast.Overall vastly over-priced for what you get.Would not recommend or go again but if you have booked or get a deal then ring ahead and avoid any of the -08 rooms (I checked each floor and all the tiny rooms are stacked on top of eachother)

<Content>Tiny rooms! We had a special celebration package at the Laietania Palace Hotel in Barcelona. The twin room was really small even for one person not to mention us, a couple. The bed was hard and narrow and probably origanally meant for only one person. There was apprx. 30 cm room on each side of the bed and about one meter between the bed and third wall. We could hear everything happening in the neighbouring room which was really unpleasant. If you choose this hotel do require excact information about the room you're supposed to stay-in in advance!

<Content>Great Hotel if your a dwarf Well as mentioned in previous reviews this hotels biggest problem is the size of the bedrooms, which is tiny just enough room for the bed and the television not 4 star at all, the bathroom is nearly the size of the room which is a plus i suppose. we were lucky enough to be on the 6th floor so the metro wasnt an issue.One thing that did bother me was the cleaning crew who seemed to be loughest i have ever heard.On the plus the location is fanastic about 10minutes from the beach, 500m from the plaza catalonia and the same from the la rambla i found the staff had very good english and were helpful.

<Content>4 star hotel??? My husband and I stayed here for one night in June, 2005. We had booked a so-called romance package to celebrate our upcoming wedding anniversary, so we were hoping for a very nice stay in the center of Barcelona. The romance package included a bottle of cava (not the best cava ever) and some strawberries, a buffet breakfast and 2 tickets to the Casino. We both agreed that the location in the heart of the Barri G贸tic is the best part of the deal, because otherwise, we found this place horribly overpriced and way under 4-star quality.The staff was friendly but did not speak English very well. After reading some of the other reviews on TripAdvisor, we were hoping to get a room higher up so as not to be bothered by the metro noise, and luckily for us, we got one on the 4th floor (there are 6 floors). The noise nor the rumble of the metro wasn't so bad - we actually slept very well apart from that - but the rooms are tiny and indeed, the bed is not ideally situated in the room! I had to crawl over my husband to get to my side of the bed as it was right next to the wall. Despite the marble floors, the rooms were not as clean as I'd expect to be in a 4-star hotel. The so-called jacuzzi was so small that there's no way two people would ever fit in it - in addition, the sealing tape between the tub and the wall had mostly come off so we were wondering if it would be safe to take a shower at all...The shower must've been the worst one I've had in years. It made absolutely terrible noise while it was on, and kept on changing between hot and cold water by itself. The pressure was really bad so it took me forever to wash the shampoo off my hair.There were only a couple of TV channels, most of them in catalan.On the positive side, I'd say the buffet breakfast was quite alright, it is worth taking in the morning. The location is convenient by a metro station (Jaume 1) and not too far from Plaza Catalunya. Yet I am so happy we had only booked one night at this hotel. It surely does not compare to our expectations of 4-star quality.

<Content>Not so Bad Stayed one night mid-Feb. Booked room through lastminute so saved a lot. Requested and received room on 4th floor. At the back so overlooked the old walls but fine.Good bathroom.Quiet, certainly not bothered by the train noise. Superb location, didn't take B'fast so can't comment. My only criticism is that the aircon only works in the summer; during the winter months it's actually the heating system so the room was too hot! even when switched off. We opened the window but would imagine this might be a problem for rooms at the front because it is a very busy road. Good value if you get a special deal but not if you have to pay full price.

<Content>Don't go The website made this place look fantastic but in fact it was pretty poor. We had to change rooms 3 times due to noise. First time it was the traffic on the busy road and the humming of the air con. The second room we could feel the room shake as the underground went under. All this disruption really spoilt our short break. I found it amazing that they didn't seem to have any decent rooms to upgrade us to when we complained! I suppose the decor was ok but no better than average - not the style hotel it seemed on the website! Location was fairly good though - only problem was we discovered a fantastic hotel down the road on the day we left. Oh yeah and the breakfast was not good either.

<Content>good and bad sides to it. Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights for a long weekend from 27th-29th.The room is nothing like they show on any picture you will find on the web. It's TINY! Barely fits a double bed. If you have been in a Premierlodge, the size of the room is about half that. Probably a 3* room.The tv is ok, not many English channels, i think it was just CNN,NBC and eurosports. There's a minibar which was nice because we for drinks from the shop next to the hotel and kept it there. Altogether, the room was 3*.But then there's the bathroom. WOW! it was brilliant... the jecuzzi was amazing... i think we used it 4 times a day becuase it was so good. Lovely bathroom. 5* EASILY... i dont think i have even seen a jecuzzi in 5* hotels.The location is again 5*, brilliant location. right on the tube station, 5 minute walk to the beach, or to plaza de catalunya. 30 seconds from the old city... Location was just PERFECT.The staff were quite friendly, although the manager was shouting at the cleaning lady when we walked in so if you get in at a bad time then dont expect too much.We asked for a room on the higher floors to avoid the noise from the tube, but they did not have any... Abit hard to believe as the hotel seemed quite empty. The noise from the trains was much better than we expected but still, you can notice it every 10minutes. Did not really effect our sleep as the trains stop at about 1am.Lobby looked pleasant and overall the hotel was 4* easily. Would recommend and would definately go again.

<Content>100-119 euros reserved on web In October 2004 we stayed three nights. Reserved room on the web, different rates for different days of the week but averaged 110euros. Great downtown location, air conditioning, redone marble bathrooms, maybe not a 4 star but a solid 3 star.Downsides are no parking at all, (had to use a public garage for 20 euros a day), and the subway/train does give the place a rumble, we were on the second floor.I challenge you to beat that price in Barcelona.

<Content>4* no way Most definitely not a 4* hotel! Cracked washbasin, mould around the bath, the (double) room was so small that one side of the double bed had to be against a wall meaning I had to climb over my partner to get into bed! Where was the advertised 'complimentary coffee on every floor'? I've stayed in many hotels in Europe. This one I would rate as 2-3*. Good location but the view of the smack-heads was not the most appealing!

<Content>Comfortabe stay, ideal location We recently spent a long weekend here, having secured a good-value deal through lastminute.com, and were very satisfied. The hotel's chief advantage is its location, close to the Barri Gothic, the Cathedral, las Ramblas, indeed everything in the historic centre, and on the route of the hop on, hop off tourist bus. We asked for a high room and were given one on the fifth floor: it was double-glazed, and so there was no traffic noise, and only a barely perceptible murmur from the metro. The a/c worked fine (and was very welcome in early September), as did the jaccuzzi. The bedroom wasn't particularly small for the heart of a major European city, and the bathroom was certainly 4*. We didn't try the (expensive) breakfast, preferring the excellent coffee and croissants at capuccino, 20 yards up the road.We think that several previous reviewers have been unkind about this hotel, and would recommend it without hesitation.
