<Content>Definitely staying here again I usually don't spend my time writing reviews, but wanted to compliment the staff and let people know of The Courtyard Marriott Ginza.This hotel lived up the positive reviews that I read here before going on our trip. We often stay at Westin Tokyo, but we had points at Marriott so decided to give it a try. At $250 per night for the room that we had, compared to Westin Tokyo's $400 per night, this hotel was every bit as pleasant. The service, cleanliness and convenience was a nice surprise. The only drawback to this hotel is that the rooms are much smaller than the Westin, but the Courtyard is located in Ginza which has the most expensive per sq. ft property in the world! The rooms seem to be recently renovated and have a nice modern decor.The subway is only one block away while our favorite Westin Tokyo is a long 15 walk from the Ebisu station. Doing that walk a few times a day gets old. :(Because the Courtyard Ginza has fewer rooms that hotels like the Hilton, Hyatt, and Westin, the lobby was always empty with no lines to the front desk and the concierge was alway readily available. Be sure to make good use of the concierge for info and tips. The speak english well and are VERY attentive and helpful. The free wireless internet in the lobby is perfect for people traveling with their laptop or iPhone or you can use the business center.We are die hard Westin travelers, but the price, convenience to the subway and attentive staff can off set the smaller rooms and convince us to stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel! You cannot beat the location and the price Love this hotel, we booked 2 rooms and spent three nights there and enjoyed every minute of it. Great location, close to trains and also walking distance to some of the sights. You cannot go wrong with this selection. Nothing to complain about and if someone did, they must have been in a bad mood when they stayed at this hotel. You will enjoy your stay for sure.

<Content>Not really a Marriott We stayed there for 2 nights. I have to say, the hotel is ok, it's clean and relatively nice but it does not meet the Marriot standards. The room was very small, we had some problems placing our bags somewhere. The bathroom was also very very small, a taller person could not take a shower standing properly. Breakfast wasn't that great, they should really offer more choice. We also took a Sunday brunch in the restaurant which was actually good and for a reasonable price. The staff at the reception was relatively friendly but did not speak enough English in my opinion, it was hard to communicate with them and they didn't really make you feel very welcome somehow. The location of the hotel was perfect, in the middle of Ginza, there were 2 subway stations in walking distance. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel, we always tried other places. We also had a small incident where the staff proved very unhelpful not to say rude; while walking around town we were stalked by some older man, which was VERY uncomfortable, especially on the first day in Japan. We talked to the staff about it, wanting to know whether this happens often etc. The guy at the reception kind of laughed at us saying that it was probably nothing etc...not really the kind of answer you're hoping for, no advice no nothing. Overall i'm pretty disappointed by this hotel even if those are minor things, they should rethink the strategy and adopt the real Marriott quality.

<Content>Sleek, modern, comfortable room but not w/o incident This is a beautiful hotel w/ small but sleek, modern, comfortable well-equipped rooms. The neighborhood is expensive and the staff seemed cold, almost condescending, not warm, inviting or overly congenial, especially compared w/ other service personnel we encountered in our 1-week stay in Japan. Both of the rooms we had on the 8th floor suffered from poor bathtub drainage resulting in flooding of the bathrooms. Though an apology was made, no discount or complimentary amenity was provided in response. We thought it was unlike Marriott to simply verbally say, We're sorry, and not do that little something extra to say, And we hope this small token will make up for the inconvenience. There is complimentary internet in the business center which is to be expected from Courtyard. We still found it to be a thoughtful amenity. The hotel uses a key system which requires the room key to be used to access the elevator. Not that Tokyo felt unsafe, but this measure provided additional peace of mind in that only people w/ a room key to that floor were allowed access.The hotel is closer to the Higashi-Ginza station (3 short blocks, walking towards the Denny's or Tully's Coffee House) on the Hibya or Asakusa subway line than the Ginza station on the Marunuchi Line (a little more than double the distance).

<Content>Very Nice and Convenient This is a newly renovated hotel (was a Renaissance property a few years ago). Very nice and clean, but TV selection very poor (no english). Not crowded at all; small and easy to get around. Subway station 2 blocks away, and walking distance from Tsukiji fish market and Ginza street.

<Content>Good business hotel I don't usually stay at Courtyard Marriotts back in the US, however this one was great. The best I've stayed at. It's more like Marriott's next level of hotel (the regular Marriott Hotel, I guess). Had everything you have in other Marriotts. This makes it a bit soul less. I could have been in Indianapolis, Houston or, in this case, Tokyo.Staff was very helpful (Marriott does a good job in hiring/training there staff), and a great concierce. (Courtyard doesn't have concierce service, do they?) She helped me navigate to my business appointments, via subway and taxi, and was thoroughly acquainted with Tokyo. Nice!

<Content>Good standard The hotel is a good base for exploring Tokyo. Location is brilliant. We walked Ginza鈥檚 streets every night - it felt very safe. A stone鈥檚 throw away is a good choice of cafes and famous department stores, beautiful gardens and the metro. Central station is also reachable on foot within 30 minutes, or taxi ride about 10 minutes.The rooms are very small, but nicely decorated and the linen is beautiful. If you have a lot of luggage, there might be a challenge to 鈥渕anoeuvre鈥?it in the room, it is so tiny. The bathroom was pristinely clean and functional, but again felt like a cupboard.Reception staff are courteous and helpful and the concierge can organise your transport back to the airport and suggest tours which pick up from the hotel.Japanese tea was very interesting in the downstairs bar/restaurant, but the food was terrible 鈥?e.g. dish of pasta with crab meat in reality was a spaghetti plate with lashings of garlic pink sauce and a limp shrimp (one) on the top as decoration. For a business hotel it lacks a choice of simple dishes, like Club sandwich, Cesar salad, etc. The internet is available in the business centre and is free. After checking in online for your flight you can also print the boarding passes free of charge.Overall 鈥?very good standard.

<Content>Great place! This is our second time staying at the Courtyard, Ginza, so that says something about the place.The location is excellent, with subway stations (plural) very close and a block away from the big name stores. The Sony, Nikon and Canon buildings are within walking distance. The Tsukiji fish market is about 800m away.Service is outstanding, they'll even provide you umbrellas!Two restaurants on the first floor, but I didn't try them to comment.Very clean, nothing was out of place and the marble shines. Room is impeccable, with towels and slippers. A bed Soap, shampoo, shaving cream, etc, everything is provided and of good quality.You have to pay for TV (about $10.00) and internet (about $10.00 for wired connection, so bring your wireless router).

<Content>Great hotel Stayed at this hotel for roughly 2 weeks using it as a base to explore ALL of Tokyo  some outlying areas.A little pricey, but it is the Ginza district  priced accordingly - we used points for our long stay. Staff is very attentive throughout the entire hotel  spoke English well enough to communicate. With the Higashi Ginza metro station within a 5 minute walk, the Ginza metro 10 minutes  Shimbashi JR station within 15 minutes - it was very easy to navigate all of Tokyo of which we did and then some.Cafe on 1st floor is nice, Korin bar downstairs is tucked away for some privacy. They do charge $10 for internet connection in room, but lobby as wifi for free - also the business center as 3 computers to use or you can take your laptop there to connect via cable at no charge.Room was adequate  comfortable for resting after spending more than 12 hours out everyday.Overall, great hotel.

<Content>Good location in Ginza We stayed here at the Courtyard Tokyo Ginza for 3 nights in May and had a great time! The staff was very helpful and spoke proper english (even though any of our attempts at Japanese was also well-received). The location is off a little bit from the main shopping streets in Ginza which is fine since we could take a morning walk to burn off the English or Japanese breakfast we had at the hotel (it is a bit pricey though we did use vouchers).The gym facilities are good but i don't like when having to pay for internet after paying XXX dollars for a hotel.It's only about a 10 min walk to Tsukiji Fish Market which was amazing to see at breakfast time, the lines of people to get into certain food stalls was something else! It's also a 5 min walk to the subway station from which you could jump off to any location in Tokyo, very easy!Would i stay there again? Definitely but next time, im going to try another location in Tokyo, maybe Roppongi or Shinjuku just to be able to explore those areas.

<Content>Very pleasant experience Stayed here for three nights in transit to Australia. Couldn't have stayed at a nicer hotel. Staff were very helpful and polite. The efficiency was unbelieveable, messges were delivered, baggage was co-ordinated and we were very well looked after. Hotel was also lovely and clean with a nicely decorated hotel restaurant. Ginza area of Tokyo is also very nice, a little far away to walk to other parts of the city but there is an underground station very close to the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location and friendly staff Just came back from my stay at the Courtyard Tokyo Ginza. It was great! The hotel rooms are not very big but that is to be expected in Tokyo (home of the most expensive realestate in the world). Our room was clean and had everything you'd need from an in-room safe to a mini frig, to free Internet in their Business Centre. The staff were always very friendly and spoke English well enough to help us get around.Location wise, its pretty much central to everything else in Tokyo. It is located on a main street but you can't really hear much of the traffic below. Just a few steps to the fish market (about 10-15 minutes) in one direction and another 10 minutes walk to the main shopping area in the opposite direction. It is also a short walk from their subway stations.I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who can afford it!

<Content>Good Location And Staff I booked this hotel for a two day stay in Tokyo. I based my choice mainly on proximity to the Tsukiji market, which we planned to visit early on our first morning, and also to the main Tokyo train station, as we were proceeding onto Kyoto on our third day.The hotel is close to a number of train stations, the closest being the Higashi-Ginza station, about three blocks away on Showa-dori, but we went to the Ginza station on our arrival as it was a single train from the main Tokyo terminal. This station is an additional 3-4 blocks, but still within easy walking distance from the hotel. We later discovered that the Shibuya Station was about the same distance away, which was convenient as Shibuya is on the JR Yamanote line, the main JR line serving most of Tokyo's neighborhoods.The hotel, as described in other postings, is under renovation, and while we were there, two floors were being renovated and off-limits to guests. We could tell because those two floors (I don't recall what floors but they were two consecutive) had their buttons blocked off on the elevators so that you could not even press the buttons, plus we had a written notice in our room regarding the renovation. We got a room on the top floor (11), several floor above the floors being renovated, so we were not affected at all by the renovations.I don't think we received a renovated room, as most of the furnishings did look a bit dated and some of the labels bore the logos of previous identities for this hotel. In fact, our hotel book still bore the Renaissance logo and most of the looseleaf pages within the book also referred to the Renaissance name.The room was small but adequate for what we paid. The room had only a small window, which was sort of a bay outcropping with windows on three sides, but not much of a view. The bathroom was a western-style, with a single shower/bath. The room came with a flat-panel TV but it was rather old and small.The Internet access was wired, but worked without a hitch.The staff we interfaced with all spoke English, or at least understood enough of it to understand what we were asking for. They had a very good English-speaking concierge, a non-Japanese woman with a European accent.One of the things that we did not see right away was a tower of xeroxed cheatsheets for many of the local attractions, as well as a current calendar of events and schedules, all written in English. We used several of these to help us figure out what to do and how to get there, though I wished that we'd discovered these before we took the long way to Tsukiji market the first morning.Again, you're in the Ginza, though on a large but not commercially active street. You're within a couple of blocks though from the main streets in the Ginza, plus you have a number of useful shops and other businesses nearby, including an AM/PM and a Lawsons convenience stores within a block, as well as a Starbucks and a CitiBank ATM within several blocks, a 5 minute walk from the hotel.We received drinks coupons for the bar in the lobby, as well as coupons for complimentary breakfasts in the buffet restaurant, Fiore, located at the rear of the lobby near the side entrance to the hotel. We had breakfast there one morning and found the food satisfactory for a quick breakfast before a full day of sightseeing. They had a full buffet of western style breakfast items, as well as some Japanese items including fresh rice and some grilled fish. We also had tea and coffee in the coffee shop in the lobby, which was also fine for what we needed.Ultimately, I think this hotel is a very good combination of value and convenience, and will probably be even better once all of the floors and rooms have been renovated. if you're going to be making an early morning trek to the Tsukiji market, this hotel deserves serious consideration.

<Content>Best Hotel in Ginza - Fully equipped facilities. No Need to Think Others People who stay in Ginza needs to know this is the most expensive location of Tokyo before they should comment the hotels there good or bad. There are many big hotels around the world much bigger than Courtyard Mariott but does not mean better.Look for prestige brand shopping like Lious Vutton, Burberry, Hermes, Frank Muller ... and others? They are just around the hotels.This is my 2nd stay in Ginza Marriott. My experience is still very good.I will agree the hotel room is not big ... but remember ... we are in Ginza of Tokyo 鈥?the most expensive area of Tokyo ... there is no reason to pick on unless one don not know Ginza.I fully recommend this hotel for people who go both business and leisure ... enjoy ... hotel people speak very good English and very good 5 star hotel service.

<Content>A wonderful experience at Marriott Courtyard Ginza. We just returned from our 7 day stay. This was a fortieth anniversary vacation trip. Loved the hotel.1. Though this is a Marriott Courtyard, it is comparable to a full service Marriott. Don't let the older outside facade deter you.2. The wonderful staff made this this a truly exceptional experience. No exceptions-all the staff. Free coffee in the lobby. 3. Business center offered free internet. It was wonderful to send daily e-mail to family and friends. Kept up with news and sports. Airport bus dropped you off at the hotel. Two hour ride in, one hour ride back. 40 miles to Narita airport.4, Less than a 10 minute walk to Tsujki fish market. Do walk through the market by 0600. Go all the way to the back to catch some Tuna auctions. We found they were not closed to the public. A must experience. Sushi breakfast at the fish market was very good, but very crowded and expensive. Market was a truly unforgetttable experience. Still worthwhile to visit by 0800.5. We ate the lunch buffet at the hotel, and for $20, we considered it a good value. We ate breakfast at Dennys across the street. Open 24 hours, and a very good French Toast or eggs, bacon and sausage was $4.50-$5.00. Coffee was $3.20 extra and very good. Free refills? Sometimes. 6. Three block walk to the shopping in the heart of Ginza. We loved buying food in the basement floors of the major department stores. Restaurants are on the top floors. Convenience stores were plentiful, open 24 hours, and had some nice food and drinks. Canned coffe and canned soft drinks were very good, and averaged $1.20.7. Hotel had wonderful detailed guides to key attractions, including easy to follow subway directions. Subways were a fun experience, and very easy to use. Don't miss the subway experience. We paid for each ride. We didn't consider daily passes a good deal. Too many different lines.8. We loved the hotel's high tech toilets. Goodbye to toilet paper. Would love to have one in my house. Even Mc Donalds have these. 9. We would love to return, but the long plane ride from Dayton Ohio was very exhausting. Tokyo is much less expensive than Europe. It is a value destination, where the savings on hotels and food, pays the extra plane fare. Unlike Europe, you can enjoy wonderful dining without breaking the budget.

<Content>Great hotel in the Ginza We stayed for 3 nights in the older rooms at the beginning of a trip and 2 nights in an upgraded room. Very quiet, good location, Starbucksround the corner if you want a cheaper coffee AND an ATM at the post office round the corner that changes money for foreigners. Good location also for the subway, and to Ginza.Helpful staff.The upgraded room we stayed in had THE most comfortable twin beds. I think once the hotel is fully renovated there will be a price hike which may well put it beyond our budget for future trips

<Content>Good hotel We stayed here for 6 nights in the end - 3 at the beginning of the trip and 3 at the end. We got a non-renovated room to begin with, which was average, then a renovated room at the end (but this costs more, particularly if you want a double bed), which was very nice and made the stay more comfortable. It's very convenient for the metro and we got from the airport to the hotel via trains no problem. Two minute walk to metro station. Breakfast is a bit poor, best to go across the road to Dennys (before 11am) and have a full breakfast and pancakes for a fraction of the hotel price. Very good for sightseeing and shopping. The airport bus leaves directly outside the hotel to take you to the airport for your return journey home. Would recommend it.

<Content>Best Hotel in Tokyo! I served as concierge at this hotel from 1997-2002 and I was fortunate enough to stay as a guest on the night it re-opened as a Courtyard on April 1. The location is perfect, the rooms are just fine, especially the renovated ones. The concierge's unique collection information (which I originated!!!) is awesomely helpful!!! The BEST thing about this hotel, though, is THE STAFF. They are the most wonderful bunch of folks I have ever worked with, from the managers to the bellstaff. GREAT people!

<Content>Top Class We had booked this when it was still a Renaissance hotel and on arrival, were pleasantly surprised. We could not fault any aspect of this delightful hotel. We would certainly stay again as its location is ideal for a Tokyo shopping and foodie trip. Once you master the Metro systems (there are three) you can travel anywhere very efficiently, a station is about a 5-minute walk. Ginza is also centrally located within the heart of the city. There are numerous reasonable but high quality restaurants and cafes around the hotel plus a visit to the Tsukiji fish market is essential - we found the external market very good.Rooms were exceptional for a four star and quite roomy. Naturally everything was kept impeccably clean and front desk and concierge service was excellent. The Aussie girl at the concierge desk was particularly helpful in recommending shopping excursions and directions. These included Bikkuri Sushi Ginza on Harumi Dori not far from the hotel 鈥?a very good mid priced restaurant. Continue the good work Marriott!

<Content>Great Location...needs work! I stayed at this hotel recently after reading reviews on this board that recommended it since the renovation.The location was excellent. Tokyo is a large city, but access to all the major rail and subway lines was ideal and it was located in a beautiful part of the city.I found the room I was booked in to be charmless and small. Two uncomfortable twin beds, small bathroom. Very disappointing for a Marriott.The reception was helpful and the free computers and internet service provided in the Business Center was a nice surprise. A very important convenience to be able to check e-mail after a long day of sightseeing.Overall I would recommend the hotel if you aren't looking for any luxury. Clean, well situated, but by no means a special treat.

<Content>Unbeatable Location and Convenience We LOVED the location of the Courtyard! Right outside the hotel, there are tons of shops and restaurants already. If you walk down to Ginza Korida Street, it's restaurant paradise! Hotel has a helpful map of immediate area. Based on recommendation of chowhound.com and front desk staff, we picked one called Midori Sushi. All the signs are in Japanese, so we had to ask around. But was it soooo worth it! Warm and friendly service with the freshest sushi and it costs two of us under $40. It was packed with salarymen and locals. Sit at sushi bar near Ogura San, if possible.In the morning, you will be able to walk to Tsujiki Market to see the tuna auction (5.30am) and other delicacies. Don't really recommend sushi breakfast there, it was twice the price of Sushi Midori and not as good.The Courtyard has undergone recent renovations. If you stay there, be sure to ask for a recently refurbished room. Room is small but decor is modern and functional. Everthing was brand spanking new! Though we were on the 10th floor, there was NO view at all. The view on the streets of Ginza more than made up for what we lacked in the room. We LOVED the Ginza area, esp. in the evenings....great people watching! We arrived at 5pm in Narita, so to avoid traffic, we took the Narita Express train to Tokyo Station (55 mins) and took a 10 min cab ride to hotel. The next the morning, we took the airport limo bus back to the airport....super convenient and comfortable, less than one hour. I srongly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't have too much time in Tokyo and want to be accesible to the airport. Much better than staying at Narita hotels, if you ask me!

<Content>NIcest Courtyard I've Ever Seen We ordinarily do not stay at Courtyard hotels. In fact, when I made the reservation, I made the reservation under Renaissance hotels. During the time of my reservation and when we arrived, the hotel changed names to a Courtyard. This is the nicest Courtyard hotel I've ever seen. Easily a 4-star city hotel. We would have missed out of this nice hotel had it been listed as a Courtyard when I was choosing a hotel in Tokyo. We had breakfast included in our stay, which was either in the downstairs traditional Japanese style breakfast restaurant, or on the main floor, a more American style buffet. Food was great, nice selection with lots of options. The room itself was small, but it is Tokyo, and we were not there to stay in the room (unlike other vacations where you stay on the resort property). It was in a great location, walking distance to so many great restaurants, the Ginza shopping district (like Beverly Hills shopping). Also walking distance to the Tsukuji fish market area. Staff was very nice and helpful. An overall great experience.

<Content>Loved it I would recommend this hotel to anyone! This hotel is so centrally located. It is 3 blocks from the main shopping street in Ginza, 10- min. walk to Tsukiji market and 2 blocks from the Kabuki theater. There are tons of restaurants around the hotel varying from ramen shops to Ten-Ichi (a 5 star Tempura restaurant in which dinner starts at $200 per person). The hotel is changing over to a Courtyard by Marriott on 4/1/07 and you could not even tell they were doing construction while being there. My husband and I are still trying to figure that one out. The hotel has sheets at the front desk that outline the main districts Tokyo including a map of the area and exact directions on how to get there from the hotel. It was amazing. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone going - whether it's your first time or 15th.

<Content>An excellent, affordable hotel I landed at Narita airport at 8:30 and by the time I was through customs and in the arrival hall, it was probably close to 9.30 am. The next direct bus to the hotel would have left over an hour later so I took the bus to Tokyo Central station. In afterthought, the train would have been the better option, it's quicker and goes to the same station. At the train station, you could take a subway to Ginza but if you're carrying heavy bags, a taxi is much easier and costs about 1000 Yen. Tell the cabdriver to take you to the Tobu Hotel Ginza, at least mine had no idea what I meant by Renaissance hotel, even after I showed him the brand's logo on the reservation.,Ginza is a good place to stay in Tokyo, the center is one of the most impressive shopping streets in the world and around this street, there are many small side streets with excellent restaurants and shops. Ginza is one of the most elegant parts of the city but it's relatively quiet and doesn't have much nightlife. The Renaissance is just a few blocks away from the main shopping street and close to some must see sights like the central fish market and the Sony showrooms.Reception at the hotel was most pleasant and welcoming. The rooms don't have in-room safes but the staff will quickly set you up with a safe-deposit box. All employees speak excellent English. I had booked a standard room at 20'000 yen without breakfast. It was on the smal side and the bathroom looked a bit worn but everything was clean and in good working order, the bed was a very comfortable queen-size.I didn't take any meals at the hotel but used the hotel bar on two occasions which was fine. There are many good coffee shops just around the corner from the hotel. And there is indeed a Denny's across the road. I had breakfast there once but the menu caters more to the Japanese taste, there's only one true breakfast item with eggs and bacon on the menu so no use going there if you're craving for a Grand Slam breakfast with pancakes. Japan isn't the easiest country to travel around in, many things are only signed in Japanese. Even with travel books, finding certain places can prove to be tricky. In Japan, you'll have a much easier time if you use the services of the hotel concierge. The one employed by the Renaissance is really great, it's a - I believe British - lady who knows Tokyo very well and has prepared numerous one page travel guides for the city's best sites. With these guides, you'll know what subway to take, where to get out, what ticket to buy and then how to walk to the place you're looking for.I usually stay in Shinjuku when I'm in Tokyo but liked Ginza as well. And I can recommend the Tobu hotel to anyone except those who are looking for a large and very modern hotel room.

<Content>Excellent location for a first trip to Tokyo We stayed at this hotel on the 21st and 22nd November this year as part of a 5 night stay in the city. It was our first trip to Tokyo which is such a huge place, cities within cities.The location of this hotel is excellent. It has good access to the rail and metro lines which you'll use a lot if you don't want to take taxis everywhere. There are plenty of restaurants both Japanese and international within easy reach including a 24 hour Denny's right across the road and a small convenience store on the corner opposite Denny's (Family Mart). There is an excellent information service and some really good leaflets with suggestions for tours and trips further afield (can recommend Kamakura, a lovely seaside town with many beautiful temples). The lobby and restaurants are fine and the service is excellent as we found it to be everywhere in Japan. The rooms are fairly well equipped but the one we had (622) was spotless but looked tired and in need of refurbishment. Possibly we got this one because we booked it on Marriott rewards and the rest of the rooms are lovely! Breakfast was also a bit expensive at nearly 2500 yen per person. We'd spent the first 3 nights of our stay at the Mitsui Garden Ginza on the 24th floor with wonderful views of Tokyo Bay, designer rooms and bathrooms and a fantastic breakfast at 1575 yen per person. It's about 3 blocks away from the Renaissance and it would be my first choice for a future stay. To be fair to the Renaissance it was a hard act to follow.

<Content>Great location and service This hotel was a lovely way to start our trip in Japan. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The English language walking tours and handouts were very helpful, with only one exception: the Lovely Morning Walking Tour including the Fish Market is a terrible walk along ugly back roads. The rooms were clean and large enough -- though the shower was a little low if you are taller. Considering the price (around 20,000 yen) it was a great stay.

<Content>Great value, good location Date: August 7, 2006Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Rochester, New YorkI just had a wonderful stay at the Renaissance Tokyo Hotel in Ginza (part of Tokyo). The hotel was small, but very nice, everything clean. The rooms were above average in size for a Japanese Hotel, with internet, TV etc. The staff was very helpful and the food a good value. This hotel was more reasonable in price than my usual one. I've stayed mostly at the Century Hyatt Hotel in Shinjuku Tokyo. Howevver the Hyatt is more expensive.

<Content>Nice but not great... Location is great for shopping, fish market. Plenty of good places to eat. 5 minutes walk to subway.Hotel is just average, over rated by some (most likely by Marriott customers who use frequent stay points for a free stay).. Rates are much too high for this hotel. The rooms are small, low ceilings, bathrooms need updating (I am talking about their most expensive rooms !!!), No views whatsoever. Clean, of course, like all Japan hotels. Staff is polite, language not a problem. Concierge is just average (most of the time her desk was vacant...). Breakfast buffets are average. No egg station, average western style preparation, boring after 2 days. You can use your breakfast coupon for lunch instead, but not worth the bother. Lunch buffet is worse than breakfast...I would chose a different hotel... (unless you can stay for free..)

<Content>Great location, great service! We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights total to bookend a 11 day trip to Japan.The location is great, just a few blocks from Ginza station, and also walking distance to Tsukiji market and other sights in Tokyo. The service is impeccable, the room very comfortable and clean. We were able to store excess luggage between our 2 stays at no extra cost which was very helpful. The airport limo bus also stops their. The only complaint which actually applies to all of Japan was the temperature of the indoor spaces - they love it to be about 80 degrees indoors, and housekeeping kept closing our window!! AC was not turned on yet since they were between seasons.Free internet connection and breakfast (western buffet or sit down Japanese) were also included and were just the thing.If we return to Tokyo we will definitely stay here again.
