<Content>unbeatable location for the price Stayed here (room 3005) in December 2008 - very clean (renovated?) room with 2 twin beds, very clean albeit small bathroom, magnificent views over Waikiki towards Pearl Harbor, with a slice of ocean from the balcony. We didn't expect much of this property after reading other reviews, but were positively surprised: this is a 5-star room in the 3-star category. I used to work in the Travel  Tourism industry and have seen a lot of hotels - this one is a gem for the budget traveler. Additional amenities include the friendly staff, the very knowledgeable and helpful concierge (Hannelore), and a location that can't be beat: two blocks to the beach, two blocks to all of Waikiki's shopping and nightlife, and the Yelp-favorite Me BBQ right across the street.

<Content>a bit disappointed My family and I stayed at the Resort Pacific Monarch in Nov. 08 for 2 weeks. The location was good quite close to the beach. Staff were very friendly and very helpful. We stayed in a one room suite. It was suppose to have a full ocean view, we only got a partial ocean view, but it was still beautiful. The pool upstairs in quite small at the deepest it is only 5ft. We rented a vehicle for 2 wks. The parking was $12.00 a day. We rented a regular size van, we accidently parked in a small car section and received a $20.00 ticket, then received 2 days later a $40.00 ticket on our windshield as we parked a little over the white line. We were'nt too happy. As far as cleanliness our room was just okay, one week went by before our bathroom floor was washed. My bed was so hard my back was quite sore. The telephone rates are very high so watch when you use the phones or you'll get a bill you might not expect when you're leaving. I think I would look at another hotel next time we come. We come every year to honolulu and always have a great time.

<Content>Very Disappointing The images on the website looked fairly modern even though we knew it was an older style hotel.The front desk staff were very friendly, but when we got to our room we were very disappointed. It looked like the photo for the website was taken 10 years ago. Everything looked shabby and run down.The sofa had stains on it and was in desperate need of reupholstery, a noisy old air-conditioning unit in the lounge, only a ceiling fan in the small bedroom, cramped bathroom and overall felt grubby. There is an extra charge to use the safe in the room which was key operated - very inconvenient.The views were lovely, but we decided not to stay as we felt like instant plebs.We walked to the Resortquest Waikiki Beach and transferred our booking. Even though we had to pay US$50/night extra it was worth it. Clean modern room with fantastic views on 25th floor. Would not recommend Pacific Monarch.

<Content>Good hotel We stayed in a triple room (1 bedroom with lounge area) which was quite nice. The lounge, kitchen area and balcony were spacious, but the batchroom and bedroom were really small. The place was clean and comfortable. There was a wet patch on the floor in the bedroom which we assumed was coming from the air conditioner, but it was no real problem. The view from our balcony was of the city, no water but still nice. The view from the roof swimming pool has great city and water views. The travel desk in the lobby was very handy for getting tips and booking tours/car hire, and the service was good. Location was good, just a couple of blocks back from the main street  beach.

<Content>So-So Just spent 4 nights at the Pacific Monarch at $109/nite.The good:1. Location, very close to the beach (hotel is behind the Hyatt)2. Very friendly employees3. Large room with kitchenette4. Fast elevators5. Pretty quietThe bad:1. Kind of shabby2. Awful view (and to be fair, we did know we were getting a city view but it was on a low floor and looked out at some really skanky apartments.)3. Twin beds instead of doubles4. On Kuhio Ave which has lots of creepy people at night5. Parking a challenge (as it is everywhere in Waikiki.)6. Underperforming a/c from a groaning unit. The room got very hot.

<Content>OK budget rate hotel We booked our hotel via the website and the room was ok. We had selected an ocean view, but rec'd a partial ocean view and a view of Diamond Head. Swimming pool is VERY small (rooftop), so beware of this is you just like to stay by the pool. Great location and great front desk staff. Probably the best front desk staff I have encountered in over 20 trips to the islands. Be sure to ask for chairs and towels to take to the beach as this is provided free of charge! Maid service was fair. Many times we had to call down to get our room made up (but they came quickly)and it seemed like they only cleaned the floor 2 or 3 times over our 10 days there.Very loud AC units in the room as well.Not a bad hotel for a budget price.

Everything was very close but it was also quiet despite being downtime in Waikiki. The cost was very reasonable. Rooms were very clean and taken care of daily.

<Content>Better Than Expected After I booked this hotel I was a little skeptical, but after staying there, I must say,it was a good choice. It was a great location and the room and service was great. Our room was on the 11th floor and what a view of the ocean. When we arrived there was a problem with the toilet, within minutes there was someone there to fix it. The room was better than we expected, a little older and the sofa was a little worn but other than that the room was clean and roomy. On this site I dont hear to much about this hotel, it's time someone gives this hotel an A plus. Thank you so much for a great stay.

<Content>Clean but outdated My wife and I stayed here for 11 nights with our three children in Room 1802. We are travelled from Australia and chose this hotel as it was next door to the hotel in which our friends from the UK were staying.We read the reviews thoroughly and after discarding the reviews in which guests stayed in rooms not run by Resort Quest or had a gripe about a single issue, such as parking, pests etc, we believed that we would have an accurate portrayal of the hotel and that most issues would have been addressed by hotel management but this was not the case.The hotel is in a great location being only one block back from the beach. Generally the staff were very friendly and helpful in providing information and maps etc and checking in and out was a breeze. We were located on the 18th floor and had good views of the city, mountains and ocean. The balcony was spacious unlike the hotel next door where our friends were staying. The room was clean however the furniture and fittings were very old and in need of updating except for the fridge and stove which were new. The bathroom, although small and dated, was clean and required maintenence as the toilet seat was broken and a towel rail was loose. The airconditioning system struggled to cool down the room so we gave up on it. The matteress on the sofa bed was disgusting in that the springs could be felt right through it and it sagged right down to the support bars. The rollaway bed was even worse as it appeared to be a remnant of the second world war and sagged so substantially that it provided no support whatever (these issues have been raised a number of times in past reviews). We requested the bed to be changed twice but to no avail. There was insufficient crockery and utensils for five persons and unless the beds are updated the room is not suitable for more than two persons.The pool area has fantastic views over the city, mountains and ocean but it needs to be beautified to make it more inviting. Pot plants and shading would make a huge difference. The laundry facilities were fantastic.Overall, the hotel and rooms need a few $ spent on them and it could make a huge difference in appearance. The property owners and management need to seriously take into account some of the past reviews as there are issues that are clearly not being addressed that ought to be.

<Content>Cozy and Romantic The customer service was great. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. They made sure they met our needs in a timely manner.Our room was located on the 25th floor and we had amazing views of the beach, city, and mountains. Nights were romantic with sounds of the ocean and lights of the city. Our patio allowed us to enjoy the night air.The location of the hotel was very convenient. It was only a block from the main strip and beach. The best part was that we didn't have to deal with heavy traffic when we had to drive anywhere.A prime location for a prime hotel. I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Really good! My family and I stayed in this hotel for 7 nights while in Hawaii for a family wedding. Our family member who lives in Waikiki booked it directly with the hotel so I'm not sure how the prices will compare but they seemed very reasonable. The rooms were large with very well equiped kitchen area (including a rice cooker...which we never used cause there was so much good food about!). Our rooms (704  705) only had views of the car park but that wasn't an issue as we didn't go to Hawaii to look out of a window! The hotel staff were lovely and the rooms kept clean and well stocked. Overall I and the rest of my family were very impressed with the standard, amenities and the fabulous locations. It took minutes to walk to the beach and although not on the beach front, you got beautiful views of both the beach and mountains from the swimming pool on the roof.I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again if I was fortunate enough to revisit Hawaii.(the rooms had hairdryer, iron, ironing board, TV, coffee maker etc and plenty of sockets!)

<Content>The perfect place to stay! My family and I recently stayed at the Pacific Monarch from 7/10/08 to 7/17/08. We stay there each and every time that we visit the island of Oahu which is pretty much every year. Danny and the staff have always made us feel welcomed and very comfortable there. With each of our visits to the Pacific Monarch, we always gain a new friend. The hotel staff are very friendly. they always have an ALOHA for you when you are coming and going from the Hotel. It's nice to be acknowledge. I always recommend the Pacific Monarch to my friends. We could never think of staying any place else. The rooms are great! Very, very roomy, and clean. The 1 bedroom condos have a kitchen, and the studios have kitchenettes. Each room has all the utensils you need to make a home cooked meal if you wanted. The hotel is central and within walking distance of the International Market, the Honolulu Zoo and only 2 blocks from Waikiki Beach. And The Bus is right outside the door. Making trips to the Ala Moana Shopping Center so easy. Each time we stay, we feel as if we have come home. Thank you to all the staff at the Pacific Monarch.From the Aranda/Ortiz familyPS. we are going back in February 2009... And guess where we are staying...... THE PACIFIC MONARCH! Aloha to all.

<Content>Caution staying here!!!! I have stayed at many various types of accomidations this is one of the worst. First off the room smelled of urine, contained old furniture, and is in need of remodeling. From the time you entered the room the smell of urine/funk hits you. The furniture was very old, no TV in bedroom, and housekeeping did the minimum when it came to cleaning and bed making.Be cautious when using Resortquest Monarch's parking lot. Resortquest states the parking lot is privately maintained by ProPark Parking Management. Propark charges $12 for 24 hours of parking. If you forget to pay the $12 for another 24 hours and place it on the dash beware. We inadvertently forgot to place the newly purchased parking stub on the dash to replace the expired one and our rental car was towed. No warning! After paying $220 towing fee and the $35 cab ride I was obviously fuming mad! The parking stub on our dash was only expired for slightly less than 24 hours and the car was towed. I talked to a ProPark supervisor who told me there was nothing they could do. After my wallet was $255 lighter and getting my rental car back, I was left with a makeshift parking ticket from ProPark which specifies that they can give warnings. The only warning I received was a 1 1/2 hour warning! They are taking advantage of tourist to Honolulu. I also talked to one of the hotel workers and was informed they are aware of the problem. This hotel needs to step up and advise their patrons of the issue as well as have a system where they notify the customers. Most hotels ask what type of car/license plate number just in case there is a problem. That way if there is an issue with a patron's vehicle they could be notified and not get zapped for $220!!! Resortquest needs to do more make a tourist visit more appealing. Never will I ever stay at another ResortQuest again. I would advise you to think twice if you are thinking of staying here.

It is super convenient and within minutes you are right on the beach. It's close to the Waikiki action- our kids loved everything! Great kitchen, bed, sofa bed, shower, and employees.

<Content>Couldnt be happier wth this hotel. I have stayed at several hotels in Waikiki but this is definitely the best. We had a one bedroom apartment with oceanview on the 12th floor. The room was spacious and very clean with kitchen and large balcony and a great selection of cable stations on the television. There is a rooftop pool which has great view of Waikiki Beach and the mountains etc. The hotel also has a self service laundry which was useful for a 10 day stay.The staff are friendly and helpful and there is a small shop in the lobby for snacks, drinks etc. I think this hotel is in a great location and is good value for money and is in close proximity to the beach, restaurants, gym etc.I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Very satisfied We were wary of the hotel because we read some reviews about dirty rooms. However, we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. The rooms were spacious, bathroom and kitchen were clean. The beds and sofa were also clean. The utensils in the drawers were a little rusty, but we didn't have to use them much. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The maid cleans the room and provides new towels everyday. 2 blocks away from the beach, dining, and shopping. Very, very convenient. Rooftop pool also very nice. Air conditioning was more than adequate.

<Content>Different units get different service. Before our trip to ResortQuest Pacific Monarch, I read the reviews on tripadvisor.com and they didn't seem too bad, and some were wonderful. We rented our unit through Aloha Waikik Vacation Condos. I realized immediately that the condition of the units, and the service you receive depends on who owns the unit. We were not advised prior to our trip that some units were independently owned, and if you were unfortunate enough to have made your arrangements through an independant owner, you had no guest services. We found this out when we told the front desk that the drain in the bath tub didn't work properly...we were told that we had to contact the owner of the unit. When we called to tell them that there was a cockroach in our unit...they again told us to contact the owner..when we contacted the owner, he sent the cleaning lady to spray the unit, but only after letting me know that they don't bite, and were cleaner than flies or mosquitos!!! When we wanted to purchase a paper at the front desk, they asked what unit we were in...and yes...we would have to pay a higher rate because we stayed in a private unit. They also had internet, but the price quoted on the sign at the desk was 1/2 the price stated on the sign in our unit..and we would have had to pay cash (Hmmm, could this be because our unit was independantly owned and we were getting the shaft??)Our garbage bags for the kitchen trash can were just small shopping bags, the carpet was old and stained, the drain didn't work properly, and the unit as a whole was completely outdated. If you plan to stay at ResortQuest Pacific Monarch, you better call ahead and make sure you will have guest services and also bring roach traps. The ResortQuest Pacific Monarch has such potential if they would put a little money into it. It's location is convenient and close to the beach...but that means nothing if it is filthy and completely outdated.

<Content>Family Trip to Hawaii Our family of 5 stayed at the monarch for 10 days in April. It was an alright hotel, it was hard to find a hotel that could accomodate a family of 5, which this hotel did. We were also looking for a kitchen, (not a kitchenette), although there was no dishwasher. We also wanted a swimming pool and hot tub. Much to our surprise, the hot tub was broken during our stay. We were a little nervous about the hotel room windows which opened, and had no bars to protect the kids from falling out, so we never opened them the entire stay. The staff at the Monarch were great, especially Dominique who always went out of his way to greet us. The cleaning staff on the other hand, were not. The cleaning lady spent about 4 minutes in our hotel room each day, and it was never really clean. One day after she left, there was sand and crumbs still on our floor, so my husband went back and actually borrowed her vacuum to redo her job. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable and clean, but the pull out sofa in the living area was a disaster. It was ripped to shreds, felt marker all over it, and the springs were popping out of the mattress. My 3 and 5 year old both complained that their backs hurt in the morning after sleeping on it. Another family in the hotel said that they ended up taking the mattress off of the sofa bed, and just used the mattress on the floor instead. WE never had any bugs, cochroaches etc. in our room, which i had previously read about, and the elevators were very fast and efficient. The parking was a pain, as it was $12/day, and you had to prepay at a machine for every 24 hours. The location was fabulous, only 1 short block to the best beach for kids, the Kuhio salt water lagoon, which is where we spent all of our time. We stayed in an ocean view 1 bedroom for $180 night, the ocean view was wonderful, but it was VERY noisy as the bedroom faced the street, where every morning at 6am all the busses and garbage trucks drove by, and we were up for the day. We were on the 11th floor, so maybe if we were higher up, it would have been quieter. We met people staying at the Sunset, who said their rooms were much larger, the pool was bigger and the rooms were cleaned well each day.Hope this helps,

We had two rooms and both were outstanding. They were clean and the furnishings were new.The views from both rooms (29th and 32nd floor) were spectacular! It is conveniently located about 2 blocks from the beach and priced much more reasonably than the hotels on the beach. I would highly recommend this place and definitely would stay there again.

<Content>central to everything Just returned home from the Pacific Monarch, the room was clean but some of the furnishing were old. We had 4 people in our room and the pull out sofa was very uncomfortable for the people sleeping on it. We did complain after a few days and they brought up a blow up bed for my sister. When you called the front desk they responded very quickly. The maid was polite but didn't leave us coffee, tea and sugar unless we asked. Overall it was very nice staying there and we may go back in the fall for another visit. If people did have compaints, all they had to do is call the front desk and I'm sure they would fix the problem. The hotel was very close to the beach and loads of shopping and many restaurants.

<Content>Worn, Torn  The Pacific Monarch location, room size  staff are good but the units that we had were aged and stained. The pull-out couch had tears and was dirtier than any I had experienced before. The carpet and kitchen floor were dirty. There was bird dung on the lamp shade in one of the rooms and the patio door was open. Strong smell when entering. The lobby is not impressive but the desk staff is welcoming. Both rooms were in similar shape so I did not ask to be moved. At 200+ dollars a day, I think they can afford some updating.

<Content>Worse than a Fleabag We stayed in a studio with 2 single beds. The air conditioner was in a whole cut into the wall by the head of one of the beds so had to be turned off at night. The mattresses were covered in white plastic whcih made it much hotter and noisier to sleep. Our unuseable balcony overlooked the parking deck. The sofa was so dirty, we put a blanket on it before we sat on it. Then when we checked out we were hit with 75 cents per local call, which we made a lot of since we were coordinating groups between hotels. We will never stay there again.

<Content>Old and tired My wife, two kids and I rented a rear one bedroom unit. It had a good fairly good view. The staff was great and the location etc. is as has been said in other reviews. It is a good location.The unit was old and tired. It appeared to be built in the late 60's or early 70's and the furniture appeared to be original. There were wear spots on the lumpy, uncomfortable sofa bed. The queen bed in the bedroom was a double bed. The only AC was a window unit in the living room and barely cooled anything. When the windows were open which was every night since the AC barely worked it was loud and noisy. The only TV was in the living room. I went down to complain and tried to move. They gave me keys to two other units...they were in the same condition. I could not have been more disappointed. As the week progressed I got used to the situation and didn't kill myself...or others.I can't imagine you could not do better.

<Content>Enjoyed Pacific Monarch Our stay was great from check in to departure. Had booked a studio but was pleased to be upgraded to a 1 bedroom with a beautiful view. The sofa bed was very comfortable as was the bed. My only suggestion to them would be the air conditioning should be in bedroom also. My friend had a handicap scooter. It was a little difficult for her to get inside the door when alone. The room was very clean and update. They have a roof top pool. Also a RR to relax after you check out and before your late flight. It is complete with refrig and TV. Location is great very close to beach. I will definitely go back again.

<Content>Only place to stay in Waikiki!!! For the past four years, we have come to Oahu twice a year and stayed in Waikiki the first two nights to help get decompressed before spending the rest of our time either at the North Shore or Windward side of island. We have stayed at a couple of other ResortQuests and Diamond Head hotels. This by far was THE best hotel we have stayed in! It is close enough to Waikiki to walk to the beach, far enough to stay away from the craziness of Waikiki and clean, spacious and the staff was very, very friendly!! We will not stay anywhere else! We have a 10 month old and they brought the crib up immediately - we had enough space for all three of us! We will definitely be back!!

<Content>Resort Quest Pacific Monarch My family of 4 stayed in the Resort Quest Pacific Monarch for 7 nights in September, the staff were terrific, they gave us good advice on bus travel, restaurants, and activities.The fact we had to wait till 3 in the afternoon to get into our room was not ideal, we arrived from Australia very tired and we wanted nothing but to have a shower and a nap,we waited on the top floor in the recreation room which was ok as it had couches that we streched out on, the view from the rec room was magnificent and as it was so high the breeze blowing through the louvre windows was lovely.As for the room it was basic, a little old and tired looking but it did the job, the biggest problem was an awful stench coming from the insinkerator! The position of the Resort Quest was so perfect we could not have been happier, everything was in walking distance. I would go back and stay again but I would pay for an extra night to get into the room immediately. I love Honlulu so much, safe for families, great holiday destination. Lynne Kuhl.

<Content>Terrific location! A friend and I stayed here from June 12-16, 2007. We enjoyed the rooftop pool while our room was being prepared and really enjoyed the view. When we got into our room, it was very roomy and had a kitchenette, full bathroom, and great views. There is not central air, so crank up the window unit to keep the room cool. It was nice to make coffee each morning and nibble at our leftovers as we had a microwave, fridge, and hotplate at our disposal. The staff was friendly and helpful. No issues there. We got around using VIP transportation and there are coupons in the booklet given to us at check-in. We visited Pearl Harbor, Hanamua Bay, and enjoyed the Paradise Cove luau. For dinner, we ate at Tiki's on the beach at a sister property. The food was delicious and the bread and butter to die for! Duke's at the Outrigger hotel is right on the sand and has lots of history and yummy food. It was crowded everywhere we went, but it was June! Be patient and enjoy the remarkable Polynesian culture. You learn much about the people and island while you're there. We had great experiences and overall, loved the entire trip!

<Content>Great Place to Stay! Great Location, Clean, Friendly Staff (Thanks Keli!), and we would stay there again. Short walk to the beach. Check out time is Noon but our flight did not depart until 10:30PM. The staff allowed us to store our luggage and provided another key for us to use their shower and restroom for the rest of the day. They even arranged for a taxi to pick us up and take us to the airport. This is not a five star hotel but for the service we received was excellent. We would recommend it to families on a budget. Being spoiled Texans who love their air conditioning, it did take a night to get use to the air conditioning in the room. We decided to open the patio doors and just use the natural air conditioning and it worked great..

<Content>Great Service This is the second time over the last two years I have been here. The service is great, they address problems ASAP, the food is good, and they just put in new carpet, working to keep the building current. I am sure there are nicer places but the PB really out do themselves on the service front. I will go back.

<Content>Loved The Pacific Monarch We stayed at the Pacific Monarch for 17 days in April 2007. It was the second time we've stayed there. We love it there. It's close to the beach, it's clean and comfortable. It's privately owned but we did have maid service twice a week. If we needed anything all we had to do was call Linda and she'd be at our door in five minutes. She was great. The staff at the desk downstairs were great and always willing to answer any questions. Dominick was wonderful. Always smiling and joking. We're already looking forward to going back next year.

<Content>OK. Nothing flashy. Stayed at the Pacific Monarch from Jan. 31st to Feb. 5th as part of our 30th anniversary vacation. Good location 2 blocks north of Waikiki Beach and 2 blocks east of the International Market. This condo style hotel is great for those who want to save a little on meal expenses. We had a partial ocean view one bedroom suite with a hot-plate and fridge. There are 3 ABC convenience stores within 2 blocks to purchase whatever you need to fix breakfast and any light meals. There's also a small convenience store on the ground floor with a smaller selection of items. Our room was on the 27th floor which provided a terrific view. The property is older but well maintained and clean. Hotel staff were most accomodating. For those who don't want to pay higher prices for a flashy hotel lobby and facilities (e.g. restaurants, bars, activities) this is good value for the money. All of the above are within a short walk at the other hotels or businesses. The only drawback is the balcony is only 18 inches wide. You can open your balcony doors but can't sit on the balcony.

<Content>Good Value We stayed at the Pacific Monarch for our 30th wedding anniversary vacation January 20-26, 2007. We stayed in a studio suite, which was very clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Our booking options were city view, partial ocean view, and full ocean view, so we elected to pay some extra for an ocean view. However, when we arrived, our room had only a partial ocean view. When I contacted the front desk, I was advised that the only rooms with a full ocean view were the 1 bedroom units, and that a partial ocean view was the best they had in a studio. Otherwise, I would recommend this hotel. Just don't pay extra for a studio full ocean view, since it apparently does not exist, although their web site indicates that it does.

<Content>Average facilities, Great Location We stayed at the hotel for three nights, in a one bedroom self contained apartment.The apartment we stayed in was average. The sofa bed, carpet and curtains needed cleaning and dusting. The fridge had a funny smell. I believe the hotel needs to go through some refurbishment. New furniture, steam cleaned carpets and fresh new curtains will dramatically improve the place.Apart from these negative aspects, my family and I enjoyed staying at the Pacific Monarch.It's in a great location - close to the beach, shops and transport. (Make sure you check out the little Asian Restaurant across the road from the hotel - cheap price, big servings, great breakfast/lunch/dinner menu). The hotel is walking distance from the International Markets and Shopping Plazas.The staff and service were fantastic. The staff were friendly.I wouldn't mind staying in the hotel again, as long as they make some refurbishment in the near future.

<Content>Excellent Location in Waikiki! 12/22-1/1/07-This was our third visit to the Pacific Monarch and we absolutely love this place! We have NEVER had any housekeeping or cleanliness issues. The hotel is located one block back from Waikiki beach, the view is absolutely the best and it is centrally located to everything in Waikiki. We have often thought about trying somplace else, but feared we would not be in the heart of everything in Waikiki as you are at the Pacific Monarch. The staff has always been wonderful to us and helpful, I recommend the Pacific Monarch highly for location, price and overall value!!

<Content>Great location, good value Two adults and two teenagers rented a full ocean-view one bedroom with kitchen for a week. The view was great, the building is 2 blocks from the beach with a great view of surfers and the main beach. Cleaning staff was good and desk service friendly. Rooftop lounge is nice but the pool is small. This is a 3 star older condo building so the rooms are comfortable and clean but not deluxe. The beds were good but the sofa bed mattress was very old. We used all the sofa cushions underneath for support for an acceptable sleep for the kids but it would not be good for adults. There is a supermarket 2 blocks away on Kuhio so everything you need is close by.

<Content>Torn couch cushions and bed bugs We stayed at the Pacific Monarch from December 21st thru the 28th. The couch/hide a bed had torn pillows with the stuffing coming out. When we mentioned this to the person working the desk they said there was nothing they could do because the rooms were privately owned and rented out. Some rooms were fine but you have no guarantees.The worse part of all was when my daughter and I woke up with bed bug bites.

<Content>Very comfoartable hotel-highly recommended Even though I have been to Waikiki many times this was the first time I stayed at the Pacific Monarch. The hotel was very comfortable. We were four people staying in two rooms and both of the rooms had the same well kept furniture and fully supplied kitcheonettes. The rooms were tastefully decorated and the room service was very good and attentive and the front desk was helpful and friendly. The hotel is conveniently located both two short blocks from the beach and also from the super market and very close to the bus stop. Late in my stay, I inspected 11 other hotels for a possible future visit. Only two others were comparable in amenities and price and all three are hotel/condo in format. I would definitely return to this hotel on a return visit and recommend it to others. The other two hotels were Waikiki Sunset and Waikiki Banyan. The rooms were larger and the amenities looked good but I cannot vouch for their service having not stayed there. I would book either one if the Pacific Monarch was not available. The 9 hotels that did not qualify for either not having a kitcheonette or else did not satisfy my inspection were: Beachside,Joy,Coral Reef (Waikiki Wave),Waikiki Beach,Hokele Suites Waikiki, Miramar at Waikiki,Ohana East, Pacific Beach, Continental Surf.

<Content>Location V's Condition We arrived hours late (after midnight), thank's to the airline. The chap at the hotels front desk was wonderful and extremely helpful. We arrived at our room on the 24th floor and the surprises started!We booked a 1 bed kitchenette with ocean veiw. Due to our teenagers being in tow we also asked for 2 twins along with the queen sofa bed. The room had the twin beds, but the sofa bed had written on it  Sofa bed no can use.So off down to the front desk I went, let the chap now what was happening, no worries, so off to the 15 th floor I went opened the door, what a stench, so much for no smoking. Way back down to the front desk again, let the chap know what the story was. Righto way up to the 28th floor, success for the night anyway. By this time it was after 1am and we just wanted some sleep. The front desk chap said that he would advise the reservations lady, and we could go down and organise the room in the morning. I take my hat off to him he done his best in the circumstances, and was excellent.The next day we finally got our room sorted out on the 26th floor, it had what we had asked for. Sheets were clean and had fresh towels daily. A nice bonus was the daily paper delivered to you door.The rooms are in a sad state, with a good renovation required. One or two people have said the higher you go the better the rooms are, well not from what we have seen, all are the same. The sofa beds are pretty well past their useby date, as were the curtains and carpet. The bathroom was ok for one, two at a squeeze, 3 no way!We had a huge patio/lani with acess from both the lounge and bedroom. Great views of the beach!!!!!!The location is great with a bus stop right across the road and the beach 5 min walk away. This location is central and an easy walk to most things. The hotel staff were excellent, nothing was a problem and they just couldn't do enough for you.Yes you can get high speed internet, access was $9.95 per day and $39.95 for the week, which is the cheapest we have paid during our stay here in the U.S.Local calls are .75c no big deal and the charges can be found by reading the hotel guest book in your room, if you care to read it. Receiving or sending faxes is extremley expensive, beware!Would we stay here again.........if the rooms were done up yes!

<Content>2nd time to Pacific Monarch Just returned from our second stay at the Pacific Monarch.It is a comfortable, affordable place to stay in Waikiki.The building is dated, but rooms the room was clean, twoshort blocks from Duke's statue, and central to all the fun of Waikiki. Recommended to those on a budget ($121/night,partial ocean view/studio), and those who don't require all the bells and whistles, just a clean room and comfy bed.

<Content>Some rooms better than others !! Room 3002 is nice.Quality varies a LOT from room to room.These are condos, not hotel rooms. They are owned by private owners, and some are owned by the hotel. Some private owners spend a lot on renovations, and some do not.You want a nonsmoking room or it will be stinky.The higher up, the better. No kidding.There is a magical vibe at this hotel because it is so close to the water, the town, and the views.You will make lots of friends at this hotel. The elevator is a major social scene. Many people come back year after year. There are many snowbirds from Canada. They know the best rooms. Wealthy older people. Also lots of young adults.Do your homework before you book a room.Email me if you like Lee@RileyAccounting.net

<Content>Happy with this hotel My recent trip in July was my second stay at the Pacific Monarch and I was again very happy with my stay there. I find the location perfect being only a minute walk to the beach and the supermarket, bus stop, international market place (with a food court-I recommend the Aloha Broiler) etc all very near on Kuhio ave. I have found the rooms to be spacious enough and did not have any cleanliness problems, decor a little out-dated prehaps, but that's not the end of the world. Having a kitchen is great especially having the supermarket so close, we made our own breakfasts and could prepare picnic lunches to take out with us. The pool is nice but being on the roof it can be too windy. Overall I like this hotel and will stay there again and will reccomend it to other people.

<Content>everything we needed This was me first visit to Hawaii. So I do not know what any other Hawaiian hotels are like. But I do know that we enjoyed our stay at Monarch Pacific! Although the room could use an update... new carpet, furniture and curtains, we had clean linens and comfortable beds. Since we were only at the hotel to sleep and relax in the evenings, that suited us fine! The lower room rate with more room and a kitchen is what prompted me to select this hotel.Our 1 bedroom suite on the 23rd floor offered a great view of the ocean and big lanai. There is an even better view from the roof where the pool and jaccuzi are located! Go there for the sunsets!The parking at the hotel garage is tight. I would not reccomend it for a fullsize vehicle. But we did fine in a Ford Escape.The hotel staff was very nice and helpful.II felt safe at this hotel. A keycard is needed to enter.It is two blocks from the beach and shopping.If you are looking for a posh hotel to entertain and pamper you, choose another hotel. If you are looking for a reasonably priced basic hotel with a nice pool, stay here.

<Content>Couldn't be better I booked 4 nights at Pacific Monarch half-hearted wondering how it would turn out, given the negative reviews I've read abt the apt. When we checked in (we got a 1-bedroom partial ocean view), we were excited that we got 1 on the 30th floor. I think it turned out much better than I expected. When we entered, there was a dining area, an open-concept kitchen with full cooking facilities  oven, a balcony which connected to the bedroom. We loved the view, though it was only partial ocean view. But i think that was good enough for us. When we looked out left was the Ala Wai golf course and pretty much greenery. Looked out right was the bluish ocean. We had a TV in the living room and also another one in the bedroom. Room was pretty small since it fitted a king-size bed, but no problems at all. The only complaint was the small toilet. There was a bath-tub but we didn't make use of it. Given the excellent location- it was just 3 mins walk to the beach, great partial ocean view and an apt with kitchenette, I think this was the best bargain I can find on the net. I am a serious researcher on my vacations plans so I take the effort to browse many websites before deciding on the best deal. Accomodation in Oahu is not exactly that cheap, so I think USD150 for 4 persons per night is quite a steal. Email me if you want to know where i found this deal.Just be warned about the overnight parking. Because the multi-storey carpark is not owned by the hotel, you need to pay US12 per night if you want to park there. It's not free. Service staff is very friendly too. When we wanted to book a taxi to the airport via the concierge, they offered us a limo ride instead for almost the same price. We're back home for 2 weeks already but my friends and I still miss that place quite a bit!

<Content>you can do better My husband and I were very disappointed in this resortquest property, having very much enjoyed other hotels in this chain. Our Partial Ocean View, non-smoking room allowed a sliver of a peek at the water if you went onto the lanai, leaned dangerously over the rail and knew where to look between two buildings, and the stench of cigarettes was overpowering. The room was not well cleaned and the air conditioning was so hopelessly underpowered that even with the shades closed all day, we could not manage to get the room under 80 degrees. The room was very large and the staff quite pleasant (although it was clear the smoking and view complaints come up frequently and there is not much they can do about it). Be warned that parking is expensive, not included, and their parking garage is not for the timid.

<Content>GREAT place to stay! We've been staying at the Pacific Monarch for years now and absolutely love it! The staff are extremely helpful and very friendly. They remember us by name every year and do not hesitate to go out of their way to assist. The location is fabulous! Only a two minute walk to the beach and fabulous views from the upper rooms and from the roof top pool. The rooms, although the decor is a bit out of date, are always clean and spacious. Our family loves the Pacific Monarch and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!

<Content>Nice hotel, great location. I recently stayed at this hotel in early February 2006 for one week. This was my second time I have stayed there. I liked it so much the first time, I stayed there again. My room was very clean and quiet. The staff was very friendly and nice to me, which I sure appreciated being that I was traveling alone. I love the location. Just two blocks from Waikiki Beach, and right on the bus route for taking the bus to Diamond Head or downtown Honolulu to see the Palace or the Aloha Tower. My only little complaint about this hotel is that there is no restaurant or snack bar in it. Only vending machines for soda. Really no problem though being there are several restaurants and many ABC stores very close by for snacks, sodas, suntan lotion, etc... This hotel is not a five star one, so it is not super fancy, but it was just fine for my needs. It is clean, safe, has great hotel staff, wash machines for doing your laundry on the third floor, near the buses, and very close to the beach. If I get to Honolulu again, I would stay there for a third time !

<Content>Better than expected My husband and I just returned from a week at the Pacific Monarch with two teenage daughters. The proximity to the beach and downtown was outstanding. We stayed a week in a 1 bedroom ocean view. The room was clean  neat, the staff very friendly. This hotel is very basic, but the cleanliness  being so close to the beach and downtown shopping made it worthwhile. The rooms are a little on the small side, but the balcony was large  both the bedroom  living room had a sliding glass door. We had a queen bed, not two twins pushed together as previously mentioned. We only had two complaints, 1st the small kitchen did not have a dishwasher  housekeeping does not do the dishes, secondly, underage teenagers were drinking  smoking in the spa and security stood right there  refused to do anything. Otherwise, it was a perfect stay.

<Content>A Pleasant Experience We stayed at the ResortQuest Pacific Monarch while it was still the Aston Pacific Monarch. Our stay there was exactly what we expected and wanted - an inexpensive place to stay with all the amenities, a great location, and a great view. We chose this hotel because they had a kitchenette, and we had heard that it was expensive to eat out in Hawaii at the restaurants. It worked out well because there was a small convenience store downstairs next to the lobby where we could pick up drinks to put in our refrigerator, and eggs, bread, and milk to make breakfast in the morning to save some money. A couple of times we did eat a buffet breakfast at the Beachcomber in Waikiki that was delicious and affordable too. As for lunch and dinner, our favorite spot was Cheeseburger in Paradise up by the beach which is 5 minute walk. What we also liked about this hotel was that it wasn't noisy and crowded with a lot of stuff going on within the hotel because of a restaurant or bar. We wanted our stay there to be peaceful.We had a One Bedroom Partial Ocean View room which was lovely. We had a long lanai that you could walk out to from the bedroom or the living room doors. We spend a lot of time out there in the mornings and the evenings looking at the views of the ocean and city and surrounding hillside. The room was clean and comfortable. The beds were two twin beds pushed together to form a queen, but they were just as comfortable as a queen bed. We didn't have any problems with sleeping at night. In fact, we liked to open the doors to the lanai to let the cool ocean breezes in. The living room area that one of our party stayed in on the pull-out couch was also comfortable because that area was well air-conditioned. The kitchen area was clean and perfect for cooking and making coffee or tea with all of the dishes, mugs, glasses, and utensils you would need. There's a kitchen table to sit down and eat at, and plenty of brochures to browse through if you need to find things to do on the island. The living room area had a couch and a t.v. and was air conditioned. The decor was tropical and pretty - very soothing for our vacation. The hotel entrance is a small lobby with a pretty fountain and a front desk. When you step through the door to the elevator and wait to go up to your room there is a fabulous fish tank filled with tropical fish. The hotel also has a pool and a jacuzzi on the roof with lounge chairs and stunning views of the ocean and surrounding hillside. We enjoyed taking pictures up there and getting to sit in the jacuzzi for awhile at night looking up at the sky after a long day of seeing the sights. There is a parking lot inside the hotel where we never had a problem getting a spot since we had rented a car because we wanted to see a lot of Oahu.We loved staying in Oahu and the Pacific Monarch hotel made it a pleasant experience. There are many things to do on the island if you can even get outside of Waikiki to do them. Among our many adventures and experiences, we went to Diamond Head and saw amazing views of the ocean, hillside, and city of Waikiki, saw a sunset at Sunset Beach, went snorkeling at Hanauma Bay, hiked through a bamboo forest to get to Manoa Falls, saw beautiful plants and flowers at the Lyon Arboretum, and went swimming with dolphins and snorkeling with sea turtles on the west side of the island.We loved Hawaii and our experience was so memorable that we can't wait to go back. We would stay at the Pacific Monarch again.

<Content>Very convienent Our stay at the Pacific Monarch (March 9 - 14, 2006) was quite pleasant. I must say that I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the previous reviews. It's not the most exciting place to stay but it was clean and the staff was very friendly, courteous and promptly responded to any requests that we made. We had an oceanview room and the view was awesome. The rooms were a little dated but sufficed. I can't say that I will stay there again but you never know. I will say that it was very convenient to the beach (1 blk away) and restaurants were not far away. The bus stop was right in front of the hotel. It's a good place to stay for budget minded families with children.

<Content>Horrible hotel This was possibly the worst hotel I have been to. Although staff was relativley friendly and helpful. The room itself was horrible. The furniture look very dirty and well used. I kept getting the impression of a big dust cloud popping up if I were to sit on the couch. This hotel has not been upgraded sence at least the early 70's.The bedroom smelled of moth balls, and there were no closets just a couple of long narrow cabinets on each side of the bed you were suppose to use to put your clothes in. I have asthma and the moth ball smell in the room was not working for me so we went down to the front desk and explained the problem. Thier response was that they we had already been upgraded what more did we want. After less than 1 hour in the room and no assistance from the front desk we checked out. I was charged a 1 night room and tax. But ended up moving to Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort and Spa, the room wasn't much more expensive but, Ah that hotel was heaven.

<Content>Aloha 2006 Just returned from a week long stay @ the Resortquest Pacific Monarch in Honolulu. Nice place, close to the ocean/beach. Friendly staff, clean rooms, good price. Second stay here. Shop around, if I found a better price for a condo I would try a different place (as long as it had good reviews) when I return to Hawaii next trip.

<Content>Great view! We stayed at the Monarch Januray 19-26, 2006. We were on the 28th floor on the east side with a studio room.I think if you are going to stay at this hotel getting a room on one of the highest floors is the key to whether you are going to like it or not. We talked to a lot of people in the hotel and the people who seemed most satified were the ones with a view. Although there is a public room on the top floor and a roof-top pool. The room furnishings were ok, nothing fabulous. When we reserved the room we read alot of reviews and some of them said that they push two twin beds together to make a bigger bed. This is something we had a problem with so when we called the reservation line directly they said that they did not do that. When we got to our room, sure enough, were two twin beds pushed together to make a bigger bed. Of course they had nothing securing the matresses together so by morning you had to make sure you didn't fall into the cavern in the middle of your bed. Once again the view from the studio length balcony was incredible. The kitchenette was handy. The maids were friendly and kept our room very clean. Also, they will let you stay in their day room after you check out and hold your luggage if your plane doesn't leave till later in the day. All in all, we were satisfied and would go back to this hotel.

<Content>Clean and convenient The Pacific Monarch is well-located, approximately one block to the beach. It is on Kuhio which is the bus route. It is close to the grocery store and other amenities. The unit was clean and nicely furnished. There was maid service every morning. The bath had a tub and the kitchenette was equipped with a microwave, small fridge, etc. All studio units are not the same as some are individually owned and furnished. The studio units have a wall of windows with a sliding door which opens to a stand-up balcony. This balcony is approximately 12-24 inches wide. From the partial ocean view unit you can see the ocean. Do not accept a unit with vertical venetian blinds on the East side of the building. The heat during the day will be very uncomfortable. Ask for a unit with black-out curtains. If the air conditioning unit is near the head of the bed you will find that it blows directly onto the head of the bed. It is noisy . Ask for a portable fan that you can leave on at the other end of the suite. There is a coin laundry on the third floor of the garage. The pool and hot tub are on the roof. The view from the roof (34th) is great. You can coose to watch the sunset (6:15) without anything to block the view. Enjoy your visit.

<Content>Great location Wonderful location. We paid for the ocean view and it was worth it! The condo was just okay. Minimal kitchen furnishings, dirty carpet, but the basics were okay. Pool is less than spectacular; no shade on the roof and no umbrellas or anything to get away from sun.

<Content>OK We have just stayed 6 nights at this hotel, it was only average, the staff were friendly and it was just l block away from the beach. When we arrived in our room it had a musty smell, I think it was unused for some time. Quite clean but did expect better. Kitchen well equipped and bathroom OK, will try somewhere else next visit. The only good thing was that the weather was in the 90's so not in the room too much. Great location.

<Content>No room for us I booked our room at the Pacific Monarch 4 moths before the trip, we arrive in Hononlulu to be told that there is no rooms available and move us down the road to another Aston hotel. The room for my mother-inlaw was fine, the room for us was dirty, the cupboards in the kitchenette locked etc. I was told all the rooms are privately owned. Some owners maintain them well some do not. My mother-in law's room was a 1 out of 3, ours was a 2 out of 3. Going by our room I would let my dog stay in a 3 out of 3 rated room.Take my advice, spend the extra and get into a decent non-Aston (ResortQuest) hotel, and enjoy your arrivial and holiday in Waikiki.

<Content>Disappointed and deceived! I had booked a studio kitchenette with an ocean view for 10 days. Everything went smoothly until I saw the room. It was small, which I expected, but I did not expect their ocean view to be what it was. I had to stand on the balcony, which was maybe two feet by eight feet, very scary, and lean over the railing about a foot until I could catch a decent view of the ocean. I was upset but figured that one thing that was unexpected was ok. That was until I noticed that their queen bed was two twin beds put together! Also, the shower, which was entirely way too small, looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months! At this point I was outraged! Ten days in this hellhole! After talking with management, I was able to upgrade to a larger, cleaner room, with a much better view for an extra 30 dollars a night. (Now thinking about it, that sure does seem like a scam! Book them on a room that we know they won't be happy with, then give them a good deal on an upgrade. They should've upgraded us for free!) At first I was thrilled, then came the horror. The air conditioner didn't work and it was so hot in the suite we had to call the front desk to get some fans. The beds were so uncomfortable I ended up with back and neck pain for my whole trip! The only nice thing I can say about this hotel was the staff. They were charming and friendly and really made an effort despite the problems I experienced. Spend your money elsewhere.

<Content>Dirty! was booked in to Pacific Monarch for three nights in aug 2005, we checked out after the first night and had it not of been late when we had first arrived we would not of stayed there at all. Found it to be very dirty, i had an infant that i had to contain so as not to crawl on the filthy carpet, old outdated rooms and scared to touch anything in case it fell apart. Not happy at all with this property, whilst on same trip stayed at aston waikiki sunset, and aston waikiki beach which were both great, only problem with waikiki sunset was slow lift otherwise clean and friendly.

<Content>Beware! In the past we have stayed at the Pacific Monarch on three different occasions with many members of our family and many friends. Each visit was wonderful and everyone was always pleased with their accommodations. My husband and I always requested the same condo because it had been updated and a pleasure to stay in. That's why we decided to fly to Honolulu and celebrate our anniversary this year. HOWEVER, this fourth visit was most disappointing. We made our reservations four months ago and as usual, we requested the same condo or at least an updated one. Upon checking in we were told, rather rudely, by the fellow at the front dest, that we weren't staying long enough to be given the kind of accommodations we had requested. We would have to take what we got. We were also told that we would have to wait for the condo to be cleaned. The second we walked through the door, we felt we had been lied to. It was quite obvious that the condo had not been cleaned for some time. There were ketchup spots on the carpet (which looked like it hadn't been cleaned in five years), we saw ketchup on the refrigerator and crumbs on the kitchen floor. The windows and sliding door had numerous dirty hand prints. The kitchen and bathroom sinks had hair in them. The lanai table had food crumbs and the chairs were too dirty to sit in. Apparently by cleaning they mean changing the sheets and hanging fresh towels. The sofa was dirty and worn to the point that it had several holes in it. The bathroom sink kept backing up and making loud noises. The maintenance man came to check it but told us there was nothing he could do. Needless to say, we will never recommend the Pacific Monarch to our family or friends again. We discovered that it doesn't do any good to request the kind of room you want. You get what they want you to have. Whether you are assigned a newly updated condo or a dirty, old outdated dump, you will be charged the same rate. Spend your vacation money elsewhere!

<Content>JUST TRY AND BEAT IT I am giving a great review for the trip and of coarse for the place we stayed. The pacific monarch is a five minute walk to the beach, close to stores and only a brisk walk to the zoo. The kichen was really handy and saved us money in food. the pool up top was sooo cool. It is not a five star or anything but for the money you cannot beat it.

<Content>Honeymoon Horror with Aston Hotels There were significant problems with this hotel. My wife and i were on our honeymoon and we were excited because we had been told honeymooners were treated like royalty and the Aston Hotels in hawaii would even give us a room upgrade. Super! However, when we arrived we were informed that we could not stay at the Aston Pacific Monarch as we had reserved. Instead, they were going to move us to another Aston farther from shopping and farther from the beach. We were dissapointed and probed further. Their other attempt to accomodate us was giving us a really low room (a downgrade from what we reserved) and pushing two twin beds together, not quite adequate for a honeymoon, really not adequate. My wife and I were extremely dissapointed because we were just married a day earlier, but, even still, the clerks were not friendly at all. They were actually subtly rude. The staff was very quick to move the blame to expedia. The problem as they first told us was that our room was scheduled to be done with construction by then, but that construction was running late so it was unavailable. Later they said they could fix the problem, but since i booked through Expedia all they could do was move us farther away. Aston was obviously at fault because the first thing they told us is that the room is still under construction but they thought it should have been done by then. It was when we refused to move the first time that they then tried shifting the blame. That is when my wife started crying . . . on our honeymoon. I reluctantly agreed to move farther away from everything to a slummy corner of waikiki. That's when I called Aston. What really made me frustrated was that when i asked if anything at all was available, the lady told me that there was a couple rooms available, but they were in a beachside hotel and we would have to PAY for the upgrade. So basically, they automatically downgraded us when there was something better available. That's when we just gave up, cut our losses, and tried to forget about the trouble we had been through. So, if you plan to stay at the pacific monarch, yo'll probably love it, if you get to stay there at all. Basically, be prepared to stay at any room in any Aston hotel if that's what they feel like doing on the particular day you arrive in Waikiki.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised We just returned from Hawaii on our 43rd anniversary...We stayed at the Monarch and was pleasantly surprised to find chocolates and champagne in our room at checkin....The staff was pleasnant and helpful. The roof pool is real nice (What a view) and the beach is just a few steps from the beach and shops... the bus which will take you anywhere on the island stops out front... If we ever get back we will stay here....Centrally located.....

<Content>Best Price that close to Waikiki For price near Waikiki Beach I could find no better. We spent a week there last month in May and it was great. The Hotel staff were friendly. We booked a Full Ocean View and to wake up to that was amazing! We stayed on the 18th floor (nearly half way up) and you could see everything. The small lobbey at the top was great and we enjoyed a few games of cards with a few beers there. The swimming pool located at the top of the roof was a nice touch too. It was nice to dry off whilst catching the views of the beach and what's down below. Only downside would be for our whole 3 weeks in USA this was the only hotel car parking we had to pay for. Because it was impossible to find anywhere else we could go. Either way an amazing and truly memorable stay.

<Content>Great Loaction at the Pacific Monarch! Fantastic Location, but I don't think I would stay here again. Front desk staff really friendly and helpful. Location is about a 3minute walk to Waikiki Beach and lots of shopping. Room was good but it could have been a lot cleaner. Carpet was really dirty and kitchen floor needed a really good clean. Bathroom is very small and could do with updating.Roof top pool is great as is the recreation room.If you are looking for a wonderful, beach side restaurant in Waikiki I would recommend the Beach House, which is in the Outrigger Reef on the Beach. Beautiful food, stunning location and reasonable prices. Can't wait to visit there again.

<Content>Pacific Monarch well positioned We stayed at the Pacific Monarch for 9 nights, which we found the staff to be friendlyand helpful. The hotel was 1 block to the beach and not far to the main shopping area's. It had a roof top heated pool and spa with a sunroom on the floor below where you could watch television and chill out. You can get towel's from the front desk for the pool and the beach at no charge. The hotel was clean but we did request a non smoking room which they said they can not confirm we would get of which we did not. The room had a stale smoking smell which I would think they should have put air freshener in the room, would have made it smell more pleasant. The room was set out nicely and had a balconey with part ocean views not full view as advised. It had a full kitchen, with table for 4 and fold out bed. Bathroom was small but ok. The cleaners were a bit shy on replacing the amenities, but did have clean towels every day. For $120 US we paid a night was what we would have expected, but would have expected alot more if we had paid $250 US a night as states on hotel site. This is our second visit to Oahu, which we stayed at Ohana Waikiki West 3 years ago and found Pacific Monarch was cleaner and friendly.

<Content>Enjoyed the condo type hotel Just stayed 8 days at the Pacific Monarch about a block 1/2 from beautiful Waikiki beach. The close location of the beach and the fact that you enjoy two rooms are the best things about this hotel. DON'T be tricked however, as we were when showed a much nicer room with a jacuzzi tub when looking over this hotel for consideration. Come to find out that was about the only suite with a jacuzzi. I must say the staff is pretty great, particularly the housekeeping staff who sneaks into your room invisibly, cleans it, replaces towels, empties garbage and quietly leaves it sparkling. One other amazing problem: bedroom does NOT have any airconditioning (which we had going the whole visit in the front room). A fan was offered and accepted, but the room stayed pretty hot. Kind of surprising considering how hot it stays even at night. The front desk must be complimented on their quick response, and each time you pass them coming or leaving the hotel they cheerfully shout  Aloha, just delightful and warm. Booking lady for inter island or Oahu adventures was darn cranky. I don't know if i would stay here again, but it was a GREAT deal for two rooms, just a little run down.

<Content>Good hotel for the value My husband, grandmother, grandfather, and I stayed at the Aston Pacific Monarch Feb 12-18 '05. We had reserved a 1 bedroom oceanview room. Our room was on the 14th floor and had a really nice view of the ocean. The balcony was situated more toward the city. Our room was average with a full size refridgerator, a stove, microwave, and all the utensils and cooking equipment you need. The bathroom was decent for the size. Not real spacey but it did the trick. The bedroom (which my grandparents stayed in) was o.k. The bed was just two twins pushed together and not that comfortable. My grandparents found it good but they like hard beds..:) My husband and I slept on the pull out sofa which was o.k. I would have slept in the floor just go come to Hawaii!! The rooftop pool was neat. I liked going up there and just looking at the ocean and city. There's also a medium sized jacuzzi and sauna located on the top floors. The lobby was small but cute. The clerks were really nice. We had the privledge of our baggage being handled by the bellman who was voted Best Bellman in Honolulu He was very nice and helpful. Definately tip him! The hotel is in a excellent location in town. We rented a car and drove around the island which I say is a must if you're really wanting to see the sights. This was my grandparents dream trip and they really enjoyed it. I believe that if you're looking for a good value and aren't real picky about accomodations then this would be a great place to stay. It's not a run-down hotel by any means. It's just a really great value hotel. A quick note...If you do rent a car and park it in the parking garage adjoining the hotel make sure that you get a parking permit for the entire length of your stay. They only gave us a pass for 1 day and we ended up getting a parking ticket. We had it resolved but make sure so you don't have to go thru the hassle. You can email me if you have any questions about the resort.

<Content>Aston was 'A' Ok with us My wife  I recently stayed at the Aston Pacific Monach for 11 nights in March 2005, and we were very happy there. We had shopped around the travel agents and online looking for a place to stay that looked clean, tidy, had more good reviews than bad and was in a good central location, and the Aston Pacific Monach had all that and more.When we got to our room (we were on the 25th floor!) we were a little disappointed to see 2 single beds, as we had requested a queen bed from our travel agent. We went to ask why we didn't get a queen bed, and were told that they can't guarantee you will get what you request. However in saying that, the next day they put the beds together with a special mattress on top and we were happy. We had paid for a 'city view' room but from our balcony we could get a good view of the ocean.The staff there were always friendly and helpful. They had a roof top Pool and Spa area which had 360 degree views around Waikiki and it is only about a 1 min walk to the beach.They also had a 'day room' that guests could use after they check out (while waiting to go to the airport), and as we didn't have to go to the airport until 8pm we found that very helpful.The only 'complaint' (if any) I would make is that our TV had a 'green screen'? - but in saying that, we didn't go all the way to Hawaii to watch TV.My wife  I would definately stay at the Aston Pacific Monach again

<Content>Great Honeymoon In Hawaii!! We just returned from our Honeymoon and all we can say is it's average. Basically it's exactly what you pay for! We were upgraded and stayed on the 30th floor and had the best views. It most definitely needs a refurbish because the room was old looking. The loby can also do with an upgrade! There was a lot of noise in the morning but your up early because the sun comes straight into your room (depending on what side your on) Dont know if I would stay there again but the locality was perfect!!! 2 blocks from the beach and the main street. Overall it was an OK Hotel.... We wouldn't say its that bad as what people do!!! Really are you going to be in your room ALL DAY LONG ??? it's only to sleep! so there you have it ALOOOOOHA!

<Content>Do not stay here!!! My family stayed here in jan 05 and the staff was horrible, very unhelpful!!! We stayed in the studio room, supposably in a king with sofa bed which in reality was 2 twins pushed together- the front headboards still like they were twins. the way the room was set up you cannot see the tv from either the bed or sofabed, only at the small table that barely fit into the room. the fridge was a tiny one that wouldnt even seal correctly. If you wanted ice you had to go to the top floor and get it! Also they do not provide coffee for each day, only 1 pkg for day 1 and you have to pay for additionals. The lobby is aweful! I have stayed at numerous hotels in hawaii and this is the worst i have ever been to! i was told this was a 3 star hotel, more like an 1 star or no star! i wouldnt reccomend this property to anyone!

<Content>Wonderful hotel ! Just got home yesterday from Waikiki and stayed at the Pacific Monarch Hotel and thought it was terrific ! I stayed in a studio, with a excellent view of Waikiki Beach and a good view of Diamond Head. My room was just as pictured on the internet. Also, the hotel is so close to everything, the beach is only about a 3 minute walk away, close to shopping and the bus stop. The staff at the front desk and the maids were all very nice and helpful ! If I ever get back to Honolulu, I would definitely stay there again. For the money, it is a great value. Just remember, it is not a five star hotel, but you are not paying for one either. I found it to be clean, safe, and a great location. A winner !

<Content>Decent hotel for the $$ in Waikiki We stayed at the Pacfic Monarch for 5days Jan26-31 and we were quite satisfied with our room.On the good side, the kichenette was very handy, it was nice to have a quick, inexpensive breakfast of cereal and toast in your room before heading out for the day. The room was clean and the housekeeping staff must have been invisible because we never saw or heard a thing from them (no annoying knocking on the door!). The front desk was friendly and helpful the few times we needed them and the rooftop pool and hottub were nothing fancy but they were clean and in good shape. The AC worked great in our room, we tried sleeping with the lanai door open and although the breeze was nice the street noise was loud (even on the 20th floor). It was also nice to be so close to the beach and shopping etc.But the hotel is old and could use a bit of an update and good painting. Although it seems like alot of Waikiki hotels have this same problem. I guess they never have a slow season to make updates and repairs. And our lanai was too narrow to actually use although it seems some of the rooms have better ones. *One tip we have for vacationing in Waikiki is bring a waterproof, cheap or disposable camera. We only brought our nice digital and we didn't get any pictures on the beach, in the rainforest, on the sailboat etc for fear of ruining our good camera. So bring two cameras! Have fun - Waikiki is beautiful !!!!

<Content>Good view, hotel ok My teenage daughter and I spent a week at the Royal Monarch this month. We had a corner ocean view suite on 17th floor and it was just as shown in the photos so we were pleased. It had a balcony facing the water and another with a view to the hills so the outlook was excellent. It faced the beach (not Kuhio Ave) so this was good as it was still a little noisy. Great location just behind the much more expensive Hyattt and just 5 minutes walk to Waikiki beach which by Australian standards is only fair but the atmosphere was great. The kitchen was ok but minimal crockery and some was badly chipped. Housekeeping was keen. The laundry on level 3 is handy. Staff relaxed but efficient enough. Decor is not stylish but overall it is good value for money for budget minded travellers. Would stay here again.

<Content>The worst hotel room ever After reading all of the reviews, it is obvious that some rooms may be alright and others are terrible. We lucked out and got the worst room in the hotel. We had twin beds in the bedroom, and there was literally six inches of space between the beds and the closets. The closets had folding french doors. You had to stand on the bed to open the closet because you couldn't stand between it and the bed to get the doors to open. The bathroom was so small, you couldn't stand at the sink and close the door. But the worst of it all.....there wasn't any air conditioning in the bedroom only a portable rotating fan. The kids had to sleep on the couch's foldaway bed in the family room/kitchen, and the air conditioner was in that room. They froze to death all night, while we baked in the bedroom (there wasn't any door to the bedroom, but the air didn't reach that far). We requested another room, but they said that the hotel was full. It was late at night, so we suffered the one night and went to another hotel the next day. Don't believe the pictures on the website, the rooms don't look anything like them.

<Content>Good for the price We actually made our reservations for a week's stay at the Royal Grove Hotel across the street from the Pacific Monarch. When we arrived a day late due to heavy snow in the Midwest, we were told that our original room was unavailable but we were being upgraded to a suite at the Pacific Monarch. Since we arrived during the busy week between Christmas and New Year's, I was expecting to be charged for our lost day but this was not the case. Our room was on the corner of the 12 floor on the Kuhio Avenue side of the building. It was high enough to have a partial view of ocean from the spacious lanai. We did have a nice view too of our neighbors in the next building over, the Bamboo. The lanai included four chairs around a table and one lounging chair. Being on the corner meant it was a bit noisy even from our floor we could hear the buses going up and down Kuhio beginning at about 6:00 am. If you do want a nice view, head up to the roof. Other than the two towers of the Hyatt Regency blocking the view, you can see pretty much in all directions from the top of this 31 story building. The room itself could use some work. The carpets are thin, there are lots of scratches and a few dents on the walls, and the television is very small. But for the price (less than $100 per night including taxes) and location (2 blocks from the beach, near the Duke Kahanamoku statue) it's hard to complain. It was reasonably clean and the room came with a cooking range, microwave oven, full-size refrigerator, and full complement of utensils. We were able to save some money by reheating leftovers and cutting up whole pineapples for a snack. We really didn't deal with the staff at the Pacific Monarch other than to ask for change to use the washer and dryer on the 3rd floor. We went to the Royal Grove for all of our needs. The staff there all seemed very relaxed and everyone was very friendly. They offered free coffee and a newspaper every morning and also gave us beach towels and body boards to use. Also, we got a reduced parking rate of $6 per day even though the PM guests have to pay $10.

<Content>Disappointing No room at the inn. Arrived on Friday, the 7th of January to find our room was being renovated. After a very long two day flight, I was not in the mood to deal with this matter. I asked to speak to the manager, because we were told we would be staying in the Aston Waikiki Sunset hotel instead of what we had booked at the Pacific Monarch. I am sure Aston did all they could (at least we had a room, elsewhere), but we did not get what we booked at $179.00 per night for 8 nights. I think I was most upset by not being informed of this decision by Aston or by Royal Hawaii Condo's with whom we booked this condo by a single phone call. We were called a taxi to take us to the other hotel, only to find our taxi driver would not be paid for by Aston. It was his first day on the job, so I paid the fare. As for Aston properties, I feel what we had was in need of a good state of repair. No I would not stay there again.

<Content>A Fantastic Deal I was a bit concerned after reading some of the negative comments about the Aston Pacific Monarch, but I can tell you that it was really a wonderful hotel in a great location. We checked in on December 19 for two days. I had booked a partial ocean studio; however, I had read that if you're over 50 they would upgrade you, depending on availability. When I asked, the desk clerk immediately upgraded us to a full ocean view. (The only irritating thing was that she didn't ask me to prove I was over 50.) Our room was fantastic. We were on the 24th floor with a stunning view of the city-at night the lights were absolutely magical. To the right we had beautiful mountains and to the left a terrific view of the Pacific. The sunrises and sunsets were spectacular. Check-in and check-out were amazingly quick and efficient. There was parking in the hotel for only $10 a day, and each floor of the parking garage had room key-operated access to an elevator to your floor. On the rooftop there was a nice swimming pool, jacuzzi, and deck with lounge chairs. There was also a nice lounge with 360 degree views of the city. Waikiki Beach was a very short walk. I would definitely stay there again, and I highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a great place to stay. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great! We stayed at the Aston Pacific Monarch in Honolulu at the end of Nov. 2004. It was one block away from Waikiki Beach which was great. We had 3 kids with us and we stayed on the 24th floor which had terrific views of the ocean. We loved it as did our kids. We were close to everything! We did NOT rent a car nor did we need to as there is plenty of public transporation. We were also 1 block away from the International Marketplace which is great for shopping. We LOVED this place and would go again and again! I'm not sure how the lower floors would be but the higher you go, the better the view. Our room had a seperate bedroom and a small kitchenette in it. The ONLY negative comment I have is that I really would have liked a TV in the bedroom. There is only one TV in the 'living room'. The staff was great! Very friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool was nice as was the hot tub. You are close to alot of restaurants, shopping, etc.

<Content>Great Staff, Great Hotel, Great Price!!! I recently returned from a trip to oahu and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Pacific Monarch was a hotel that I had stayed at during a past trip to Hawaii. We stayed there during the week of 11/23-11/30, I was a bit concerned about the condition of the rooms after reading some of the reviews on this site. We booked a studio and was upgraded to a partial ocean view studio due to the fact that we were on our honeymoon. We were placed in room 2901 which gave us a great ocean and city view but it was hotter than hell i spent the first two nights sweating to death, well not literally. When we called the front desk to ask about a fan one was sent to our room within 10 mins. I was unable to deal with the heat and my husband spoke with Danny at the front desk and he was very willing to move us to a different room he even offered to help us move. We were then moved to the 32nd floor the room was comparable but there was a few subtle differences that made a huge difference. There was a ceiling fan which helped with the air circulating and cooling the entire room, the bathroom was way bigger and the view was even more spectacular than the first room!!! The staff at this hotel Wes, Nifla and Julie were all great helps to me when there was an issue with our billing they went above and beyond the call of duty. There are many great moderately priced hotels in Waikki but between the staff, and location the price of the room should have been way more than a mere $75 a night. Trust me I am a total princess when it comes to hotels and I felt like a true queen the entire time. :-)

<Content>good service we spent 7 days at the aston pacific monarch. Arrived to find some confusion re the suite offered to us but the manager immediately took care of the problem and the staff made calls to our suite to make sure everything was to our satisfaction, it was .The hotel is clean about 1and a half blocks from the beach and very central to everything else. we would recommend this hotel to both family and couples.We had for the past 4 years sayted at the Ohana Reef Towers but on our last stay there found it in very poor condition. the suite was dirty, the kitchette had no utencils,the tap in the bathroom didn't work and the elevators kept breaking down so patrons had to walk down the stairs to the main floor , I wrote to the manager and their head office but received no reply so felt it was time to change hotels.Glad we did too.

<Content>Good Hotel Good Location Good Value We checked in on Sept 28th and found the front desk to be very friendly and helpfull. We were able to check out 3 different rooms before deciding on the one we wanted (2701 Studio). Since this hotel is a condo type hotel the rooms will vary slightly on the interior look, one room was all tile no carpet and each room had differences in the bathroom fixtures and lights. We chose to upgrade from partial ocean view to ocean view which cost $10 more per night but was worth it because we could sit at the table and look at the ocean and Diamond head. The room was of normal hotel room quality nothing outstanding but a good room. The cleaning staff were good, we got new towels if when they were left on the floor and the bed linen was changed twice during our 11 nights (this is the norm with all hotels I have stayed at). The room was clean, no bugs and no mold. To get to the elevators you had to pass through a security door like at apartments and the parkade was locked at 11:00 pm. The hotel is two short blocks to the center of Waikiki Beach and only a block from a Food Pantry but I found better prices at the ABC stores. The roof top pool was warm and never crowded. If the AC is not blowing well enough check the foam filter and rinse it out, ours was dirty but once cleaned it worked much better. The kitchenett was small and consisted of a sink, small fridge, microwave, coffee pot and a 2 burner portable hot plate. If you plan on cooking get the one bedroom because they come with a complete kitchen. At checkout they had a room to store the lugage in and provided the Hospitality room to use during the day which is a large sitting area with a sink, fridge and TV. There is also a shower to use but the light was not working when we needed it so the hotel staff opened a room up for us to use the shower in, very nice of them!! Only the most expensive hotels in Waikiki will be the same quality as a good hotel (Westin Calgary) on the mainland. I have stayed at 5 star hotels and at family run road side motels. I have been to Waikiki 3 times and unless you are willing to pay $300 or more per night the best quaility hotel you will get will be the equalivant to a nice family hotel such as a Ramada or a Best Western. If we go to Waikiki again this would be the hotel we would stay at.

<Content>AWESOME !!! What a great hotel! I don't think the two thumbs down review stayed at the same hotel!? My bride and I stayed from Oct 11 through the 17th. and were greatly pleased with the hotel, location and above all the staff! I booked the basic studio with a city view but when we arrived, they knew we were newlyweds and gave us a one bedroom ocean view as a free upgrade!!!! WOW!!!! Also, complimentary champagne and macadamian nuts! There was a newspaper at our door every morning at no charge. Housekeeping was daily and VERY courteous. The front staff at the counter were extremely helpful on directions and places to visit. The pool and spa on the roof offered an excellant view of the city and beach. Our room was immaculate! No noise at night. Easy two blocks to the beach and shops. Most tour pickups were at the Hyatt which was one block down, SWEET! I do recommend that you buy your tours locally through the numerouse tour package vendors around the island and not on websites. It is a lot cheaper! The one exception is the  Home of the Brave Tour. Buy that online and wear comfortable shoes for walking. Definately take the submarine tour, that's great! Again, cheaper at Waikiki. Great food at good prices can be found everywhere. Our favorite was Keoni which is two blocks away from our hotel. Breakfast for $2.99 and dinner around $10.00. We made lunch at the hotel since it had a kitchenette with utensils, pots and pans. You have to wash your kitchen things but so what? My thanks to the staff at the Aston Pacific Monarch for making our honeymoon very memorable. We plan on coming back with the kids after the International Marketplace is redone in a couple of years. The Ashton Resort has a booklet that is packed full with kid friendly places, as well as kid friendly deals. More stuff on Hawaii. The Aloha flea market is way overrated. Nothing really any cheaper than you can get at the local marketplace. Save your time. Also, the buses goes everywhere you might want to visit for only $2.00 a person. They give you a transfer slip for free return. All in all, the hotel and staff was great, the beaches were great and the sites were wonderful. Go and enjoy!

<Content>2 THUMBS DOWN! This hotel is NOT like the pictures on the website! We were so excited to get such a great rate and when we arrived, we could not believe the trashy looking rooms and lack of security. It looks like it was a renovated apartment complex from the 1980's! It was not modern or clean. We walked into our room and walked right back down and said forget it. We were told by a rude staff member that the one night's fee was not going to get returned to us. My advice is if you like crowded, unsecure, dirty hotels, then this hotel is for you, otherwise please do not waste your money at this hotel.

<Content>Loved it! This place hit on all cylinders...we booked two one-bedrooms with partial ocean view, and got two rooms side by side on the 28th floor. The one bedrooms were clean and well-appointed, though not high luxury, and had HUGE corner balconies. The rooms were on the backside of the hotel, but they had amazing views of the ocean since the balcony wrapped around. You couldn't see the whole ocean, some taller buildings in the way, but you could still see a major portion of it. AND you also had incredible city and mountain views. Not many places offer all three views. (For the best veiw, go to the rooftop pool/jacuzzi. ) We booked a rate through the Entertainment Book (a mere $100+tax), and it was an amazing value, especially since the rate was good for up to four people (most places charge $20 more for a third and fourth person). The hotel is in the middle of Waikiki, and it took about two minutes to reach the beach. If you go, request a higher floor for a better views (the hotel has 31 floors, and I called the morning of our flight to ask them to set aside as high a floor as possible, and they gave us 28). There aren't a lot of bells and whistles, just a well-located, clean property that's more than worth the price. I can't think of an all-around better value.

<Content>It's decent.. We booked the Pacific Monarch for the Oahu part of our honeymoon. We were told that due to being honeymooners, we would be given an upgrade and we were - from partial ocean view to full ocean view.When we got to our room, we found it was fine - nothing spectacular, but fine. The view was nice but the condo was incredibly hot with an antique air conditioning system - one of those boxes on the floor that does nothing. We asked to switch rooms, in hopes that it was just our unit that was on the fritz, but were told that they were all the same. Asked for a fan, but it didn't help due to the sun beating in all day and making the place a sweat box by evening.I can only speak for the ocean view condos (we were told they were all identical) - they are small and old but clean. I prefer a more modern, newer look and this didn't have it but we did check out a few other condos in the area (we got keys to see the rooms) and it was one of the better ones in the area. Doesn't seem like many condos in the Waikiki area have ever been updated or renovated.The pool was packed with kids when we went to see it, which turned me off a bit. There were deck chairs to lay in around the pool but they were all full when we went to check it out. We did switch to the Hilton after 1 night as it was our honeymoon and we couldn't deal with the lack of air conditioning. If it hadn't been our honeymoon, we might have sucked it up but while there wasn't anything really wrong with it, it was just OK. If you don't mind an older, small condo and aren't concerned about being hot, then it's a good deal in a great location.

<Content>Great family vacation! My family of five along with my parents spent July 29th-August 5th, 2004 at the Pacific Monarch and we really liked it! The one bedroom was plenty roomy. The a/c didn't seem to be keeping the place cool enough and after we talked to management a new one was installed that day! The a/c does seem to have trouble getting from the living room to the bedroom so you have to start with the a/c on high when you leave in the morning and just keep it running the entire time.We walked or took the city bus most places and the location was terrific. It was two blocks away from a great swimming area on Waikiki with showers and a great beach. If you hang out until 6 p.m. you can see the torch lighters come thru and light the torches right there on the beach.The pool and jacuzzi are a little small but it was nice to take a trip to the jacuzzi after a day at the beach!The staff was very helpful and prompt! Would be happy to stay there again!

<Content>Excellent Place to Stay My family and I (9 total, 4 adults and 5 kids) stayed at the Aston Pacific Monarch between July 17 and July 24, 2004. The service we received from the hotel was wonderful. It was clean in the rooms and the hotel public areas. The kitchen had all the needed utenicls for cooking our own meals. We had a free paper everyday and were within walking distance of the beach, convinent stores, and a grocery store. The township was doing construction along the main road outside the hotel but the hotel can not be held at fault for something out of their control. We didn't have a hard time finding a parking spot in the parking lot, however, the space to pull in and out of the 5 level garage was tight for a two-way space. Overall it was a pleasure to stay there and be able to see the city and the ocean from our lanai and window views as well as being treated so nicely by all of the staff. My family and I would gladly stay again if we were to go back to Hawaii.

<Content>Great Hotel My family and I stayed at the Monarch for 2 weeks in January of 2002 and I will be returning again for 2 weeks in September of 2004. The rooms are very clean and nice. The size of the lanai's are very good (unless you happen to get a studio room, because the lanai's are super small) and the kitchens are well equipped with everything you need to prepare meals. The Food Pantry is located very close so you can purchase groceries and it won't cost too much. The staff at this hotel are very nice and helpful. During our first visit, we arrived at around 3am and they had apparently over booked the rooms and didn't have our room for us. Even with that disappointment, they called a taxi for us and sent us to another Aston Hotel (no extra charge) and then the next day they sent another taxi to come pick us up and we got to stay in the Monarch like originally planned. They even upgraded our room free of charge. They seem to want to please all their guests no matter what and that is refreshing to see as not many other hotels I've stayed at seem to care about their guests as much. I highly reccomend this hotel to families, couples or singles. There is a room at the Monarch that will fit your needs. It's in a great location and everything you will need or will want to see is within walking distance. I'm very excited to be going back in September, not only will I be getting to spend time in Oahu, but I will also be able to stay at the Aston Pacific Monarch and it makes the trip even more wonderful.Much mahalos  alohas to everyone at the Monarch!

<Content>Great deal and location We stayed at the Aston Pacific Monarch from July7, 2004-July 14, 2004.We had booked this through Costco travel and the price we paid was great.I would definitely call this a condo as compared to a hotel room. It doesn't have the atmosphere of the big name hotels at Waikiki, but I didn't travel 5000 miles to spend time in our room. Our room had a partial ocean view, was clean, and fulfilled our needs.The location is ideal, walking distance to the beach,restaurants, and shopping. There is a concierge to help you with any tours or activities.It's a great value and yes we'd stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel Just got back from a stay at the Aston Pacific Monarch from June 28th to July 5th. We had an oceanview studio room on the 15th floor. The room was nice for my wife and myself. It was very clean. The air worked o.k. but we were also given a fan to use which helped a lot at night! The hotel is very close to the beach, the market place, and places to eat. The staff was very friendly and helpful to us! We would stay there agian on our next trip to Ohau! For the little amount of time that you are in your room you can't beat the great price!!! If you are looking for a hotel you should really look into this one!

<Content>The ocean view Studio was not like the picture The picture on the internet of the Ocean View Studio was not the same as we actually received. I believe that view (internet picture) of the Ocean View Studios is on the opposite side of the Hotel in which we were staying. When I complained, I was told as long as you are over the other Hotels and can see the ocean from the balcony, then it is an ocean view. I would have rated this hotel higher, if I would have got what I had paid for. However, after getting over the disappointment of receiving a partial ocean view room for a ocean view price, the hotel itself was a great place to stay. The room was nice and the location of the Hotel was great. The pick up point (for buses) for Tours, Dinner Cruises and etc, was only two blocks away and also the beach was near by. I would stay there again, but I would not pay for an Ocean View Studio again. If you want a great Ocean View, then get the One Bedroom Ocean View. I know these rooms are on the right side of the Hotel for the view.

<Content>Great location We visited Honolulu 6/2004. We had a very nice room on the 24th floor, oceanview in front and city view on side of room. It had a small kitchen with a full refrig. Air conditioning was in the living room, which was a problem getting air into the bedroom. Staff was friendly and helpful. Parking is tight but available for $l0.00 per day. Location is short walk to local Food Mart,International Market, and other fine restaurants. We would stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Reasonable Price When we told our 3 children, ages 10, 13, and 16, that we were taking them to Hawaii for a family vacation May 25 through June 2, 2004 everyone was extemely excited. That is, until they found out that we would all be staying in the same hotel room. In the past the only experiences they had had with hotel rooms were those that consisted of two twin beds and a bathroom. They had never stayed in a suite. After a few moments of commotion, we assured the kids that they would all be very comfortable in our room in Hawaii. And, indeed, the great folks at the Aston Pacific Monarch made us look like heros. After our very long, trans-continental flight from Jacksonville, FL we arrived at the front desk of the Pacific Monarch around 5:00PM local time (our bodies thought it was 11:00PM). The lobby, as many public places are in Hawaii, is open air, cool and comfortable. One corner had a small sitting area with a babbling waterfall and tropical foilage. We were greeted in the typical friendly, Hawaiian fashion, with a hearty, Aloha, and quickly checked-in.If there is anything to complain about with this splendid hotel, it is that the first room the assigned us to had two twin beds in the master bedroom - decidedly unacceptable for my wife an I, we like to cuddle. But, after a few moments of confusion, we were re-assigned to a more acceptable room on the 29th floor.The view was spectacular! To the north we could look out upon the cloud veiled peaks guarding Honolulu and to the south we could see the surfers off Waikik beach trying to catch waves. Now, to be sure, it was a partial ocean view, but for me, I could see enough of it to make it an ocean view. My wife and I took to sitting on the lanai at night and gazing at the lights climbing the mountains in glittering spikes. The air-conditioner cooled the room just fine and even kept the bedroom cool during the day when the door was open. But, at night, when our door was closed the a/c could not do the job. We asked for a table fan and left our lanai door open, the breezes coming off the mountains kept us plenty cool and, even a little chilly a few evenings.As with most hotels, location is a major selling point. While the Aston Pacific Monarch is not on the beach it is only a few short blocks away. In fact, while sitting on the lanai we could often hear music from some of the beachfront establishments wafting up to us. The hotel is close to shopping, restaurants, and entertainment as well. And we found that we rarely needed to use the rental car unless we were leaving the city of Honolulu for adventures further away on the island. Parking was a bit of a challenge at times in the very small and narrow parking garage but, we always managed and at $10 a day it wasn't too outragious.The pool on the hotel roof was small, but I don't know about anyone else, when I am staying a few blocks from one of the most famous beaches in the world, my swimming time is devoted to the beach, not the pool. There is also a hot tub on the pool deck that was quite nice on evenings after exploring the island on foot. Below the pool deck is a large, open lounge room with views of the mountains, a television and several comfortable couches to sit on, perfect for stretching out and relaxing in the evenings. And here's a secret -- the Coke machine in the lounge dispensed 20oz sodas for the surprizing price of only $1.00. What a deal! Particulalrly in a hotel where I am accustomed to paying $1.50 or more for a 12oz can.All-in-all, we had a wonderful stay at the Pacific Monarch with nothing bad to say about it. The room was comforatble, the kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, dishes, full sized-appliances and even a microwaves. We saved a bundle by eating breakfasts and a lunch or two right in the room. The parking, while the spaces were a challenge to manuver a mini van into, was acceptable. And the location was ideal. What more can you ask for for $100 a night with the Entertainment Coupon book discount. Not bad for a family of 5. We highly recommend this establishment.

<Content>very nice room  After spending 7nights in Kona in May 2003, we ended our vacation with 2 nights at the Pacific Monarch. Our room in Kona was not very nice and I had about given up on depending on a picture to book a room. When we checked in, we were given an upgrade , and our room was absolutely perfect. I wish our entire vacation had been at this hotel. Very courteous employees, very clean rooms. I hope all the rooms in this hotal are as nice as ours was. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Aston pasific monarch was really REALLY GOOD VALUE! This hotel was so good that I had to write about it. It is so centrally located, next to buses, shops, and wakiki is less than a minute away, you are right in the heart of the city here. Also, little moped and scooter rental stands are everywhere, little auto mobile contraptions which one can rent to explore the island, theyre fantastic! the staff are very kind, always out to help, they actually care, which is rare these days. the pool upstairs is rather large, and a private spa is located around the corner, there is much room to sunbath in those sunchairs, and the sun is right above you at all times. there is also a HUGE room one the pool level with a tv, and heaps of comfortable couches, for you to just lounge about in, and it makes checking out easy, if youve got a place to go.Everything is really clean, and the kitchenettes are very handy and can save you a lot of money. the balconies are large if your on a corner, with tables and chairs. the beds are so comfortable! the maids are great, and the trash shoots and laudrey rooms make all the difference as theyre in the building.this hotel is a jem. its very good value as the rooms are big, and balconies are big, especially on the corners. the tvs are big also, a bonus and there were no bugs in our room, or any insects. the air conditioning worked well, but just closing the doors and windows keeps the place cool.this hotel is the best weve stayed at, out of many the best located, and staffed, and roomed! go here, you'll love it if you are after a generally cheap, central condo. we had a fantastic time! the beach is one minute away...mmm life guards!!!!!

<Content>Very happy with the Aston Pacific Monarch We just got home from staying a week at the Pacific Monarch. We were very happy with the hotel. We found it clean, the air condition was working well, and very convenient to shopping and the beach. They have three elevators which handle the guests well. We felt very comfortable with the location. As long as you are not expecting a five star hotel, I thing you will be satisified with this hotel.

<Content>Great Value at Monarch! We made our reservation for the Pacific Monarch through the Royal Grove hotel which is across the street from the Monarch. You may find pictures on their site (royalgrove.com) They have condo units. We stayed in unit 1103 one bedroom unit. We paid $150 a night during the high season for 3 adults. The condo was clean, roomy, separate bedroom, and sleeping for 2-3 in living room area. Great kitchen area with everything you need. Even, a full size stove and refrigerator! Great lanai and living area with great ocean view to Kuhio Beach. In fact, the whole apartment had either ocean/city view as it was all windows throughout. We could not have been more pleased with the room and services of the staff at the Royal Grove/Pacific Monarch. Christy was excellent at the checkin desk at the Royal Grove. (pink hotel across the street). We paid $6 parking. The airconditioning was perfect! We ran it for 11 days no stop with no problems! You won't go wrong with this room! Aloha!
