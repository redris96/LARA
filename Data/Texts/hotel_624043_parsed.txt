<Content>Great experience, but it could have been even greater! I stayed in Tepi Sawah with my fiancee for 3 nights. Made our booking through the yahoo messenger. When we checked in (at 2 PM), we were informed that our room was still unavailable since the guests staying there were engaged in a tour somewhere. Quite a dissapointment, I must say. But, after 10 min or so, the staff offered us to use the Ubud Villa until our room was ready, so we were not that disappointed. Ubud Villa is superb! No doubt, it is more expensive than the room we booked. Ubud Villa is big, with huge bed and humongous bathroom! It has separated shower chamber and bathtub (large stone tub!) After 2 hour, the staff phoned us and said that our room was ready, so we moved to our Taman Villa room (Taman 101). It was on the first floor, opposite the hotel's restaurant (Bale Banjar restaurant, not the Tepi Sawah restaurant). The bathroom, although not as big as Ubud Villa's, was lovely, spacious, and clean. And there were flowers in the tub..so nice of them! Great tub, by the way!Oh, and there's this one day when we overslept and we thought we had missed breakfast (since it's already 10.30 AM WITA), but one of the staff called our room and offered us to have our breakfast in our room! Very thoughtful of him!Positive points:- Lovely and crispy clean room- Beautiful and serene garden and swimming poolSeveral drawbacks though:- We never received our cold towels- On the first day when we asked whether the breakfast could be served at our terrace through phone, without further confirmation, the front desk staff said it was not doable. But the second day, when I got curious and approached the staff in Bale Banjar restaurant, he happily said OK! - The water used to flush the toilet was stinky! Had a very disgusting odor.- The first time I opened the shampoo's bottle, it was so stinky! I dare not use it, and I poured the whole liquid to the wash basin so that it would be replaced the next day. To my relief, the replacement smelt good, which means that the first one was either outdated, or somehow spoiled.- Breakfast was so so, if not boring..croissant served was always soggy. The diced potatoes were just nice sometimes; tender, and delicious the first day, but were plain and not as tender on the second day. And it was of small portion. The menu was always the same...after 2 days, you would probably be bored.

<Content>Never again!!!!! Where do I start... My Husband and I stayed at Tepi Sawah for 5 days in September, we had traveled round Bali and the Gili Islands and this was the final part of our stay. The grounds of the hotel are great, beautiful flowers and plants, the pool was fantastic but that was it. Everything else was disgusting, the towels in our room were dirty, every single one. We stayed in the Padang Tegal Villa, which we were told had views of the rice field which it did not!! The room when we arrived looked nice and clean but when we started to settle in we noticed how dirty it was, each corner was full of muck and beside the bed was old toe nail clippings, which stayed for the full duration no matter how much they 'cleaned.' We had planned to eat in the hotels restaurant one night but at 7pm the hotel staff phoned to say that it was closed as was room service, so we had no prior notice. The next night when the restaurant was reopened we got room service, which gave me food poisoning for the next couple of days.The hotel provides a car to go back the airport (at a very steep price) on leaving, we were told directly that it was the car used to go back and forth to the centre of Ubud which we were happy about because it was very comfortable even at that price, but when it was time to go it turns out the car was just a normal taxi. So if anyone is planning to go to Tepi Sawah DO NOT get the hotel transport to leave as it is 3 times the price of a normal taxi.Over all it was a very poor end to an amazing holiday but we still love bali!!!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel Everything about this hotel was beautiful- the clean and comfortable rooms with private patios, the gorgeous landscaping, delicious breakfast at the pool, tea in the afternoon, the friendly staff, the adjacent rice fields. They picked us up at the airport without any problems. We arrived late so the restaurant was closed but the duty clerk brought us toast. Answered our questions about the area and places to visit. Took us back and forth to the main street intersection in Ubud in their shuttle van (5 minute ride).Be sure to visit the restaurant for an extensive list of tea and fruit juices.

<Content>Little piece of heaven!! We absolutely loved our stay. It is the perfect place to do nothing or head into town to go shopping or see the sites. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Regarding the breakfast menu that some complained about...they are wrong. The breakfast menu was quite large, fitting both Asian cuisine and Western. My favorite was the banana pancakes...mmmmm. We will definitely come back.

<Content>Excellent expect for.. We had come down to Bali for a 5 day trip from Singapore. After our first few days in an absolutely fab resport in Nusa Dua, we had decided on this for the last part of our stay in Ubud.As soon as we arrived, we were greeted to a very warm welcome and our room was ready for us to get into immediately. To describe the rooms, a Batuan room is more than sufficient, and in fact really beautiful and large and you needn't go for anything bigger if you are not looking for your own private pool.In any case, the rooms were nice and big, beds were good, sheets and towels clean and the mosquito net was effective. Please try and get a room on the second level so that you can have an amazing view of the rice fields. Also, try and avoid some rooms where you may have others walking in front of your patio to get to their rooms. (can't help more with room numbers but this is possible).First thing to note, in spite of the calm and serene surroundings, you will be woken up or shaken by the 'live' scarecrows on the fields every morning, and they do perform almost throughout the day. I wouldn't know how else to describe this.The price for these rooms are great value. The place itself is a bit further off than other places along Monkey forest road to the heart of Ubud, but we didn't really mind this as we had a bike hired for the days we were there and we quite enjoyed the ride through the roads of Ubud and no place is further than 15-20 mins on the bike in any case.Now, for the bad bits -DO NOT TAKE THE SPA PACKAGES - they are expensive and maybe average of service. There are standalone spas along Jln Hanuman etc. which will give you better rates and better massages, albeit a bit less hygienic.1 - The first guest officer was really nice (Made i think was his name) and he was extremely helpful.2 - The guest officer at checking out was obnoxious and downright rude. We were asked to pay half the room rent to extend our check-out from 2 to 6, in fact, we ordered a 3-hour spa package during these 4 hours and we were still asked to pay in full for the spa and for the room. This was not nice or reasonable, and on top of this, even though the spa package was really expensive, our treatment lasted only 2h40m and when we asked him about this, he just turned away and informed us that we got the facial, the massage and the scrub, so that is all. This is not very professional and both my girlfriend and I could've been happier with another 20 mins of the massage.Finally, for the food, it's nothing worthy.Overall - I would reccommend this place because it is reall beautiful, but please be warned as above..

<Content>Great stay at Tepi Sawah Villas My husband and I stayed here for two nights and we really enjoyed the hotel. The staff were always very friendly and the room and the grounds were always immaculate. We stayed at the Peliatan Villa with a King Size bed (with mosquito net). The room was very nice and we specially liked the outdoor shower and the view of the rice field. It was lovely to sit outside in the morning and hear the sounds of nature.We also enjoyed the swimming pool and the dinner at the restaurant. A nice touch is the free tea or coffee in the afternoon. The only downside is that it's not within walking distance to the center of Ubud, but they definately make up for it by offering free transportation to the center and back to the hotel. Overall we had a great stay and wish we could have stayed longer.

<Content>Tepi Sawah a treat! The first floor unit we requested was booked so we were upgraded to a second floor room looking out at the rice fields. It couldn't have been better. A very comfortable king bed, a lovely shower with an 'open air' roof (but private) and view of the volcano. The staff was helpful and charming; free rides into Ubud were easily arranged. As far as the 'spa' part, there really isn't one, but we arranged for a couples massage in our room that was great. The pool was tranquil and beautiful.Food was the only drawback, but breakfast was ok. We enjoyed exploring the restaurant scene in Ubud, which I highly recommend.

<Content>Very relaxing Fantastic 4 days at the hotel. We had booked last minute so we had to change rooms after the second day. The hotel arranged for it and made it really easy. We got to stay in the cheapest room and the most expensive due this change. Both the rooms were very good, have all the amenities that you expect - clean bathrooms, pretty fancy decor, nice kingsize beds, privacy. The main difference is that the expensive room directly overlooks the rice fields and has a great view. It also has an open air shower. The food menu is small but acceptable. Breakfast is eggs, meat and fruit. THey don't bicker about seconds helping or making something what you like. The pool is quite and cute. Thought the hotel was full we hardly had more than 3 people at the pool. The staff is really friendly. They make you feel right at home, there is no attempt to force you to do things, but there is always someone around when you want to order a drink or room service. The best thing that I liked is that this is slightly away from the town centre and that gives you the peace you need. The hotel provides free car service to Ubud and you can use is as often as you like, when you want them to pick you up just give a call and they are there in 15 minutes. The drivers are also a great source for local tips and hints. They suggested the best places to eat and shop. In one of the shops which we had stolled into for buying statues, the driver saw us and came in and told us that if we were considering shipping the statue (which you really have to since they weight over 50kgs), we should reconsider this shop since they have bad local reputation for not shipping once they have been paid. That saved me quite a bundle.

<Content>Tepid about Tepi Sawah Perhaps my expectations were a little too high after reading all the glowing reviews about Tepi Sawah, but I wasn't impressed by this hotel. As others have noted, the gardens and pool were gorgeous and I loved the traditional Balinese arch and small courtyard that led to our villa. Our room and bathroom were spacious, but there were a few problems. We had a wonderful swimming pool sized bathtub and we enjoyed relaxing in it after long days of sightseeing, but the shower nozzle was attached to the wall at an awkward height, making it impossible to take a shower. The skylight above the bath would have made a lovely feature if it weren't for the fact that it leaked and was absolutely filthy. There was a safe in our closet, but no instructions on how to use it. The bed was massive, but the sheets didn't fit it properly. Although there are much more interesting things to do in Bali, my husband is addicted to TV and was disappointed there was no satellite. The service at the front desk was generally good, but one morning we were embarrassingly late for our biking tour because we never received the wake-up call we requested (thank goodness we weren't catching a plane!) Our biggest complaint, however, was the restaurant. We tried Western and Asian selections to no avail - everything was awful!Tepi Sawah wasn't expensive at about $85 US, but I still thought it was overpriced. I didn't think it was an exceptionally good hotel, just an OK hotel with a nice garden. My husband and I both preferred the place we stayed at in Legian, which had satellite TV, a good shower and a decent restaurant. Surprisingly, it cost us $30 less!

<Content>Wonderful week at Tepi Sawah We stayed at Tepi Sawah for the last week of December 2007. We wanted a quiet, relaxing break and spent quite a bit of our time at Tepi Sawah as we have visited Ubud several times before and were there for a rest not shopping or sightseeing. Our villa 鈥楶edang Tegal鈥?was upper level and had gorgeous views over the gardens and pool. The big bathroom window looked towards the rice fields. We personally thought the garden view was great and preferred it to the higher priced villas with rice field view. A minor problem was road traffic noise most noticeable in the early morning. You may not experience this on a ground floor level villa and probably not at all if you faced the rice fields.We booked via internet enquiry followed by many e-mails. We secured our room with our American Express card. However when it came time to pay they would not accept American Express and we had to pay on our MasterCard. Another $ item to be aware of is that the rooms are all quoted in American dollars (USD) which was fine with us. When calculating our bill it was done so in Indonesian Rupee (makes sense as this is the local currency). The exchange rate from USD to Rp was calculated by the hotel reception at 鈥榯heir rate鈥?we considered this about 10% different than the current bank rate. In future we would ask for a Rp room rate so we knew where we stood rather than USD.Our room was lovely; very spacious, walk in robe area by bathroom and separate room with desk and view window (useful for laptop, charging cameras, phones etc). We had a bed/settee (not very comfortable, a big king bed, TV, fridge and large outdoor area. The bathroom was very spacious with an excellent toilet. As you see the rooms on the web site is how they are. There were no fly screens but after the first night we had a mosquito coil lit on our balcony every night. We also purchased some fly spray at a local store and this took care of any insects inside the villa. Our room was always clean although evening turndown was a bit haphazard with one damp towel left on the bathroom floor for changing tidily replaced on the towel rack!We have seen quite a few Bali hotel gardens and must say Tepi Sawah is the very best we have seen. Beautifully and lovingly maintained with ponds and statues tastefully arranged throughout. The swimming pool is a joy to swim in with a defined shallow area that is very suitable for non swimmers and children. Although the villas were fully booked during our stay the small complex was amazingly quiet and unpopulated. We seldom shared the pool or the breakfast area. We usually waited about 10 minutes for transport but often took the opportunity to look through the Nyoman Sumerta Fine Art Gallery (next to the villas) 鈥?you could never tire of the spectacular art on display there.The streets outside the hotel offer a view of Bali many tourists never see. We enjoyed wandering along (watch your step on the erratic paving) looking at he artisans in the open shop fronts and were made welcome to watch then at their work. Umbrellas are provided by the hotel for your use. There is wifi in the lobby area.Thanks to Made and the staff for a wonderful stay. Highly recommend.

<Content>Great Choice for Ubud Area We found this hotel after others that were recommended by friends proved to have no availability. As promised, the hotel facilities were beautiful, the room excellent, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The landscaping of the public areas are just stunning, also, and while the location is not within easy walking distance of the 'action' in Ubud, the hotel will provide free transport for guests to Ubud upon request.The only complaint I had was the breakfast--it was very monotonous, with only three choices: a Western option of eggs in a range of preparations, Indonesian fried rice, or Indonesian fried noodles. After a few days we gave up on the breakfast and just ate out. But that's a minor quibble.

<Content>Place is beautiful...but not the people After reading all the good views, I happily booked my reservation through a website, asiarooms.com, and my booking was confirmed. But when we arrived, we were told by the staff that resort was fully booked, and that they only have rooms on the next day. You can imagine the frustration after travelling 1.5 hours from Nusa-Dua to be told that my confirmation was late, although the booking was already confirmed by asiarooms.com. We were also told that the fault was not of the management and we were told to take another resort that's not to our liking. And the nerve of the sales rep to reply us in a rude manner that if we do not wish to take the alternative resort rooms that was obviously worse off, we can sleep on the reception couch!!! I'm a frequent traveller and never once have I experienced such uprofessional and appaling behaviour from any resort staff. All the greetings and smiles are routinely practiced, but once there's a predicament like this, the ugly head rears out, and the true colors shows itself. But luckily for us, the resort owner Ari, a plesant woman in every way helped to save our honeymoon from a step to being disasterous. She was able to accomodate us in a villa on another resort was just splendid. Overall the tepi-sawah resort is in everyway as described by many reviews minus the service. Thanks Ari for saving my day.

<Content>We Love Tepi Sawah 3 single ladies decided to go to Ubud for a few days, and i was in charge of finding accomodations. It was a great sigh of relief when we got to Tepi Sawah, as everything was just great and the rooms were actually as per the pictures on the website. Staff were friendly and accomodating and responded to every one of our queries and requests with grace and warmth.The rooms were clean and beautiful and oh the garden ...and poolside...it was just what we needed, quiet place to reflect and slow down from our hectic work schedule as well as to wind down after a day out in Ubud town. We se the care taken to mantain the landscaping and we appreciate the effort.There were only 4 rooms occupied when we checked in Thursday so we were spoiled by feeling that it's our very own private garden and poolside even when having breakfast with the cheerful morning crew.Even when more people started to check in over the next few days over the weekend, we still felt the privacy as everyone was quietly going about their vacation at different paces and we seldom bumped into other guests except maybe for breakfast.The free shuttle and friendly drivers were indeed a great help, they made recommendations when asked and all the places that we went were excellent (spa, restaurants).All 3 of us would definitely love to come back...keep up the service guys...thanks for a wonderful vacation..

<Content>Beautiful place to stay! I emailed to book this property after reading reviews online and was definitely not disappointed! The location was great - a bit outside the main part of Ubud but right next to a large rice paddy. Our room overlooked the paddy and it was so relaxing! Also, they provided a free driver to drop off and pick up in and around Ubud, which was really great.We booked two villas and they were both great! Huge four poster beds with mosquito nets, large balconies, good bathrooms. The pool was a good size and had a shallow area for kids. The gardens were filled with orchids and were beautiful.Our only complaint was breakfast, which was small and not very nice. However everything else far outweighed this small issue.Definitely recommend Tepi Sawah to anyone!

<Content>A serene paradise We stayed at the Tepi Sawah having booked it through Asiarooms.com, and we were not disappointed.Beautiful boutique resort hotel, friendly and helpful staff for whom nothing was too much trouble.We stayed here in the middle of our stay, having been in Kuta for 4 nights. It is a little way out of Ubud, but the free shuttle bus all day and night makes that a non-issue really. Ubud itself is a maze of shopping and bars and restaurants - none of which we busy at all whilst we were there. The pool area is beautiful, very tranquil and whilst we were there, although the 12 rooms were all full, it wasn't busy at all. The only fault we could find with it was that there were only 4 sun loungers so if it had been any busier it would have been a problem.Our villa - the Peliatan - was again lovely, with an open garden-bathroom - he only issue being the ants! Always very clean though. Breakfast was an interesting affair - the Indonesian fried rice being the best option - the western option best avoided.Food everywhere we went was great in Ubud - Cintro, Three Monkeys and babyface were our favourites - ask Wayan to make you a Caipirosca in babyface - the best we had.Overall - highly recommended.If you need transportation whilst in Bali, our driver Wijana comes highly recommended - he took us all around the island, was very trustworthy, gentle and knowledgable. He can be booked in advance via his website [--] or [--].

<Content>Beautiful and peaceful! We stayed at three hotels during our recent trip to Bali, and the Tepi Sawah was our favorite! The rooms are large, nicely decorated with local art, the bathroom is equally large with nice amenities (and a bathtub full of flowers on our first night!). Our room had a safe and robes and slippers were provided to us. the staff and service at Tepi Sawah were absolutely world class, and rivaled that of a 5 star resort, with personal touches that made you feel especially wlecome. The complimentary transoprt was a huge plus. To be fair, my only criticisms of the Tepi Sawah are that the breakfast is served by the pool, and although the scenery is breathtaking, the distance the food traveled from the kitchen to the pool caused the food to be slightly cold, this is a very minor complaint, and should not deter anyone from booking a room there. You won't be disappointed!

<Content>great first impression of Ubud We only returned from Bali this week, so our review is fresh from our experiences. Tepi Sawah was a fantastic place to begin experiencing Indonesia. The rooms are minimalist, but not to a degree that does not give warmth. The bathrooms on the first floor are great, with the indoor/outdoor thing going on (beautifully done). AC worked well. Our service was excellent, attentive, kind, happy, and genuinely pleased with pleasing us. Everyone, from the cleaning team of 5 who managed our room each morning, the drivers and reception gentlemen who always leapt to help answer any question and solve any needs or shuttle us about town, and the wait staff at both restaurants were a constant source of amazement at how pleasant and easy interaction with staff could be if one stayed at the right place.If Tepi Sawah isn't booked solid on our next trip, we most certainly will stay there again.

<Content>Awesome Place, Fantastic staff What a place, we never expected such a nice quiet place even after seeing the photos submitted by other readers. We had just come from Lipah Bay near Amed, needless to say it was pretty underdeveloped...Ubud came as shock to us, so many tourists..Luckily, Tepi was so relaxing, everyone there so kind, it was such a pleasure just to hang out by the pool and read our books. The food was really good too, and not pricey. We actually added tine to our stay there!The shuttle bus is a must, you can leg it to town if you want but so much easier to get the driver to take you in,and when you want to come back, get a restaraunt or coffee shop (try Cafe Moka!!) to ring and they'll get you. Also I'll plug Highway Internet, super fast and they make great coffee and snacks too.At Tepi Sawah, Made and his staff made sure our time there was very important to them, and I will tell everyone who'll listen that it is one of the best value places to stay in Ubud.

<Content>Excellent value for money Totally agree with previous reviews.I stayed in this hotel in August 2007 and really had a great time.Relaxing atmosphere, great staff, free shuttles to Ubud center at any time, nice pool and rice paddies views on rooms terrace.You have really a great value for your money around 50$ breakfast included. The room was spotless and cleaned twice a day.I would definitely come back.
