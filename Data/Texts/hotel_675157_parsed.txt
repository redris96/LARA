<Content>very beautiful design hotel Very nice hotel if you like design, architecture...It's a dark and orange square from the outside with a multitude of colors on the inside. Staff is friendly, the terrace on the top floor gives, I think, one of the best view of Madrid (with the top floor bar Penthouse of the Reina Hotel). The lounge bar proposes very good tapas with great white wines too...I surely will recommend this hotel to everybody who wants to change of traditionnal hotels based on the same style and who wants to enjoy goo moments in a wonderful environment. Here is a new way of enjoying. And just to finish, if financially you can afford that: book your stay in a junior suite: simply wonderful, pure, just like white and orange, 2 green apples, you and your man (or woman...)Go there!It gives me the willing to taste another Room Mate hotel in another world city...

<Content>Super Cool! Stayed here for 3 nights in cold November and had a great time. We booked a Deluxe room and were really happy with the size, decor and facilities, although there weren't any tea making facilities. Spent a good 10 mins working out all the different light switches! The room was clean, modern, really good, with a great walk in shower. We were a bit worried about overlooking the main square but the windows were great at soundproofing - mind you it was cold outside, so I wonder if it's noisier in Summer when there are more people milling about. This hotel has a fab roof terrace that is currently the cool place to be seen in Madrid. We huddled in our coats and had a beer as the sun set. Cool dining room, though we only sampled breakfast, which had a good range of foods on offer. We didn't see much of the staff but they were helpful and friendly when approached. The hotel is in a great location for exploring - it took us maybe 20 mins to stroll to the Prado, and it's really close to all the shops on the Gran Via and Fuencarral, and near the Metro. We found the Chueca district to generally be fun, unthreatening and interesting to walk about. Only bit I would recommend avoiding is north of Tribunal. Madrid was great, really easy to navigate on the Metro, and small enough to walk about loads!

<Content>Recommended Great value for the price, centrally located (Chueca) in a neighborhood with many bars, restaurants, efficient staff, breakfast included in the price of the room, clean, nice toiletries. Would definitely stay there again, or at another Room Mate Hotel elsewhere.

<Content>Worst Sleep Ever, Hip but tooooo Hip There is a nite club in the building called Gift. On a friday and saturday night it pumps our loud muisc until 3am in the morning. The worst night (no) sleep I have ever had.When I rang to complain at 12.30 am and requested to be moved rooms they couldn't care less. Saying they were 100% occupied. I have never been to a hotel that is 100% occupied in the middle of winter.When I wrote to complain I got no response.And the breakfast is a buffet with cold coffee.I will never stay here again. Try the Urban it is great.

<Content>A fantastic place to stay! Stayed here last weekend for a friend's birthday and couldn't have had a better time. The location is perfect - easy to get to on Metro, but not on the main drag so not noisy. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly - at all hours of the day/night! The roof terrace had a great view of the city and the local square and a gorgeous barman (bonus!) and beds to lounge on. The rooms were very modern and clean and the giant naked men on the walls were a pleasure to see last thing before sleep and first thing in the morning. Breakfast was good - a good selection and available 'til noon (essential on a girly weekend). There are a great selection of bars and restaurants nearby and you can catch the tourist bus 5 minutes walk away. Thanks for a fantastic stay!!!

<Content>Trendy Boutique Hotel My husband and I chose Madrid as our first stop in Spain for our honeymoon and decided to stay at the Hotel Room Mate Oscar. Mainly because of it's central location and the trendy-ness of the hotel. The service at the front desk was great. Our Spanish isn't great but it didn't matter since the lady at the front desk spoke English. The rooms are sooo cool. I love the colors and the modern look of the rooms. It took us a while to figure out how to turn the lights on, and then realized we had to stick our room key card into the slot haha. They serve free breakfast everyday, which was pretty cool. It started off our day until we got hungry again. The only thing is that they run out of coffee quickly so be sure to get there before 8am to get coffee. Location was really central and we pretty much walked EVERYWHERE and it wasn't a bad/far walk. Right outside our window was a plaza where people hang out and it wasn't even loud. Probably because it was off-season and the temperature was a bit chilly (rained a day as well). We also hit up the bar/lounge downstairs called GIFT. Music was pretty chill and always had people coming in and out. If we ever come to Madrid again in the future, we'd definitely be back at the Room Mate Oscar!

<Content>Bit disappointing I think I expected more from this hotel after reading reviews and seeing the photos. The curtain had holes, the bathroom unit around the basin was all rotten, the toilet and bathroom door would not close, the glass behind the bed was dirty. Breakfast was great though had no veggies, like tomato, pepper etc, definitely missed that. Pretty good location, if your standard is not that high than it is a good central hotel.

<Content>Highly recommend this hotel! Everything about this hotel from the helpful staff at reception (who all speak excellent English) to the spacious room, comfortable bed and quiet location make this a must-stay hotel for either business or leaisure in Madrid.We stayed in room 402 which has the green design from their website which we really liked. The room is on one of the side streets, so coupled with the excellent double windows, means that it is quiet even although the hotel is close to Gran Via. The bathroom was excellent. Very large, great shower and in a modern style. Free wireless internet is very good.We didn't expect much for breakfast for the money we paid, but it turned out to be superb also. Great coffee, simple buffet style, but again the staff were quietly efficient to ensure that nothing ran out. Great value for money, and we will definitely stay here again next time we are in Madrid.

<Content>Loved it!!! Just returned from a three night stay for my 40th birthday with three female friends. I really liked this hotel. Very trendy and modern and kept very clean. Cannot agree with previous reviewers over the check-in staff, we were treated exceptionally well and we loved the doorman, he was so sweet, saying hello and goodbye everytime and making sure we had enjoyed our day. Yes it is in a noisy square, yes the bar is busy, but surely people have an adea as to what they are getting before they book a hotel like this? Deluxe bedroom had great space and fantastic shower. Breakfast was ok, but agree more coffee etc should be available at busy times. All in all had a great stay and would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.

<Content>Nearly an Oscar contender We chose this hotel on the back of the current reviews as well as it's location.It's location is great, just 100m from the Grand Via whilst being relatively quiet. All important attractions are but minutes walk away.The hotel room was excellent very clean, spacious, good air conditioning and excellent sound proofing from the square outside. Good bed and very clean.The public areas are very contemporary, a little plastic but work well.Breakfast is adequate, but why can't coffee be ready all the time, just one jug for 75 rooms.My only slight complaint are the staff. The doormen being the exception, always a hello. Inside however is a different story the front desk staff can barely raise their heads to acknowledge you. But worst is the excellent roof top bar where unless you are a friend of the barman you will not get served. we walked out on our first night after waiting 15 mins to receive no service. Advice. Stop posing and serve your customers

<Content>I was disappointed I was unfortunately disappointed by the Hotel Oscar. Although I appreciate its attempt to be trendy and modern, the materials and execution throughout the hotel are decidely cheap. Although the hotel is fairly new, cheap materials were already showing their age in my room and in the halls where there was cracking, chipping and scuff marks. The biggest problem (or plus depending on your viewpoint) with the hotel may be its location. It is on a very busy and somewhat sleazy plaza in the Chueca district, which is very crowded and fun, but populated by a young, loud and noisy crowd almost every night. The hotel similarly attracts that same crowd in its bar/restaurant and it results is a noisy, smoky, less than attractive enviroment to sleep or rest in unless you are under 30 and intend to stay up partying all night.Another upset we had is that the hotel wanted to charge an ungodly fee (40 Euro) for each of us in our group to use the great rooftop pool/ bar during the day. That's ridiculous and discouraged all of us.

<Content>Generally disappointing - but good location We stayed 3 nights at the Oscar in June. Overall, our experience was disappointing. To lead with the positive - it is in a terrific location; walking distance to everything. The front desk staff were all very nice. The top pool area was very cool. Breakfast was completely adequate - service there was very nice.However, when we initially checked in, we were given a room with a completely soaked carpet outside of the bathroom. We initially thought it was a leak from the a/c, but the staff simply brought their housekeeper up to talk to us who was embarrassed to admit she spilled water from a bucket. No big deal, except they were completely booked and only could give us a handicap room - or move us the next day. We opted to move the next day and were given a (very) slight upgrade. Our first room had a view of a wall. The second room had a view of the plaza, which was an improvement to be sure.Both rooms were quite shoddy in execution. Things like the shower door not closing or opening without creating a huge mess, peeling paint, awkward sinks and ridiculous lighting systems.We also were surprised that we were not told about the pool area when we checked in. It was on our last evening that we remembered we had read about it on Tripadvisor and decided to take a look. It was cool, though service was snarky (at best).The most disturbing experience was coming home around 2:30am and finding our hotel door wide open. After peering around to make sure no one was in there and trying to check to see if our belongings were all there (which I believe they were) we called downstairs. The staff told us that perhaps we didn't close the door all the way. When I said that would be surprising since that has never happened to me before, he said it actually wouldn't be because they have a lot of problems with people thinking they close the door, but not actually latching it and then they blow open. Hu??? That might actually be true, but certainly, you should tell people when they check in!As a result of everything, I really cannot recommend this hotel. There is a hostel on the other side of the plaza - probably no pool, but same location.

<Content>cooling down in madrid CHECK INupon check in Jacopo handled my request of a more light airy room with indifferent , un motivated and cold attitude POOLin order to be able to access and use the pool i had to make a reservation but unfortunately out of 3 days of my stay i could make use of the roof top pool only 1 day as it was fully booked.be aware that there is a very confusing policy about accessing the pool ( only reason beside the location why i had booked the Roommate in Chueca in August ...) as the hotel sells entrance tickets to citizens while hotel guests are refused the entrance.......a sandwich at the pool costs 12,00 euros .....mmmmmmat the pool for which access on the 3rd. day i had to be placed on a waiting list , i was asked not to occupy with 2 other friends the large matress as was made for 4 people and not for 3....the pool terrace was half empty and until 16,30 i left the hotel still no signs of crowds or potential guests that could have filled up the place.....IN THE ROOMlight switches in the rooms ( and i have changed 2 rooms ) do not work properly and its very confusing for what they stand for....my room was not done for 2 days as , apparently a switch by the door was turned on red ( there is no sign whatsoever indicating that that round switch is for do not disturb)AT B'FASTdo not expect to be greeted neither welcomed in the bfast room as the waiters are not trained to say good morning neither to smile.they surely do not add a smile to your start of the day.beside if you are there late and are consuming your bfast dont expect to be asked if u'd like to take something more from the buffet , instead they rush and clean everything quickly so that on your next round u find an empty buffet.....LOCATIONlocation is great being very close to museums , gay clubs , bars restaurants and the best of madrid sightsDESIGN:cool but cheaply made

<Content>Good, not great Stayed at Room Mate Oscar for six days in late June.I must say that from the reviews I was expecting a bit more, but it was OK. I was in a standard room with views to the roofs of Madrid. I was lucky that it was on the sixth floor because lower floor rooms look into the walls of adjoining building, a bit like a vent shaft.The room itself was OK, clean with good lighting and comfy bed. The only odd thing is the bathroom. There is no bathroom per se. As you enter there is the sink with a large counter, a glass divider, the bed and then another glass wall with two separate doors. One is the shower the other the toilet. I麓d rather have a proper bathroom, but...A minor problem was that cable TV reception was terrible and it took a few days to get fixed. Free WiFi worked well, and breakfast served until 12 is a good idea.Staff was very nice, in general, but in particular the Bulgarian cleaning lady.I did not try the rooftop pool, but should be interesting to take a dip overlooking the city with synthetic grass.Location is very good, on a lively square, halfway between Gran V铆a and trashy, but fun Chueca. Sol is not far as well.

<Content>Good Design Hotel Hotel is exactly as on web. Rooms at front would be noiser, but nice view over square. we had room at back, nice, but looked into light well. Roof top pool and cocktail area which is gorgeous, but 40E to go to for the day, or 20E after 5pm. Seems very expensive! and no discounts for staying there. Breakfast is good. Showers excellent, beds comfy. However, whole experience was ruined for us, by being double charged for our room - which took over a week, escalating to AMEX fraud, and threat of legal action to get reversed.This hotel is in the middle of the Chueca area - great for night life, but a bit 'grudgy', grubby around the edges. If this is what you are after, this hotel is good. I believe by going 3 or 4 streets away you are still close to the action, but nicer areas

<Content>Does not desserve the price... I am fond of the different hotels of the chain : Mario, Laura...but here the price is far too high compared to the poor quality of the rooms.I had a junior suite (250 EUR) which was :- floor looked dirty- window was not closed and could not be- water had still his bar code (not the price hopefully)- decoration was not even nice- the bed was not stable- toilets small- no hair dryer- shower, not bath ! should have both options.- breakfast = american coffee (can not be considered as real coffee, believe me). I asked for expresso and I was said there is none !!! Unbelievable !!!- no computer available in the lobby - I was offered to go behind the desk....Of course the swimming pool was not opened : not informed when I booked.Bar on the roof top : same thing, not opened, not informed.You can send mails to confirm the reservations and ask for feedback but first of all you need to justify the ridiculously price !!!Last one : 25 minutes to have a taxi...To finish with something positive : the personal, nice and welcoming. What can I say : extremely disappointing. Go to the Mario or Laura, it is better.

<Content>Great Option This is a great hotel in a great location. The room we had was a good size, enough that there was a couch in the room. The bathroom was nice. We have a green room which was probably more understated than an orange room I'm guessing. Our room was also quiet. The beds were comfortable, and we didn't have any troubles with the shower. The late breakfast is great as well. It is just a block from the metro stop, and within walking distance to most attractions in Madrid. It was a great value as well. The price was fair. The hotel staff was very warm and accomodating.

<Content>"And the Oscar for the most over hyped hotel goes to......The Oscar! We felt compelled to write this review because we feel somewhat surprised by the contrast between our own experience and that of the other reviewers after staying at the Hotel Oscar. We realize that in writing this we are going against the prevailing opinion regarding this hotel. We also admit to being totally bemused by the fantastic reviews that the Hotel Oscar has received. Anyway, my girlfriend and I have just returned from a 5 night stay in Madrid, spending 2 nights in the Oscar. We both agree that this is by far the worst hotel we have stayed at whilst in Madrid. We do agree with the other reviewers that the location is fantastic and the staff are pleasant and helpful, but the hotel itself is pretty poor. One of us was in Madrid when they were putting the finishing touches to this hotel last year so we know that it is almost brand new. We also realize that the hotel is only a 3* establishment, but its rooms are small with only a poky little bathroom, have poorly finished decor and kitted out with cheap fittings and even cheaper furniture. We tried two different rooms- a double on the 6th floor that was dreadful and a twin on the 5th floor that was a little bigger with more light but still finished to the same poor standard. We are glad that we didn't booked a suite if these two rooms are anything to go by. When you read the words 鈥渃hic鈥?and 鈥渃ool鈥?and 鈥渇unky鈥?in an hotel's review you expect something special. The only areas that warrant any praise are the reception area, the hotel corridors and the roof terrace. The rooms themselves are starting to look tired. The area around the sink is a cheap laminate wood surround that is already starting to blister because of water ingress. It is the same with the shower area- the silicon sealant is starting to go black with mold. The first room we tried had loose shower and tap fittings and scuff marks on the walls and some of the worst finishing off of decorating that we have seen in any hotel. The row of tiles in the shower closest to the ceiling had had as much paint on them as the ceiling itself. The hotel's website boasts that a well known Spanish interior designer worked on the this project. It is evident from the overall standard of the finish in this place that the designer's vision was let down by poor workmanship and a low budget. We can almost guarantee that in twelve months time the reviewers will not be so effusive in their praise of this hotel due to the deteriorating condition of the rooms.To add to our overall disappointment with our visit, the breakfast was equally as poor as the rooms. The first morning we took breakfast the tables had not been set, and those that had been used had not been cleaned ready for the next guests to use. The coffee dispenser was empty and not refilled until someone asked about it. There were no plates on which to put your food- again we had to ask for these to be provided. There was just one guy trying to cope with all these demands from the guests wanting breakfast- it was not enough. Maybe we just caught them on a bad day. On the second day the service was a little better but still not great. To add to all this, the selection of food was very limited and the quality mediocre . We would describe it as very basic at best.Maybe we are being too harsh on this place, but we spent the first three nights of our holiday in the excellent ME Madrid Reina Victoria Hotel in Santa Ana Plaza. That hotel had very mixed reviews and was nearly 100 euros a night more, but it was nearly 100 times better than the Oscar. All we can say is try this place for yourself if you need an hotel in a great location, but don't let your imagination get too excited. Take all the reviews with a pinch of salt- even this one- and go with you instinct. All we can say for sure is that we certainly won't be coming back here. Ever!

<Content>Excellent in every way The hotel is excellent..the area is great for shopping, like all reviews say it's 2 mins from Gran Via metro stop. We got a taxi from the airport which cost 35 EUR after the taxi driver got lost! The metro back to the airport was 2 EUR each. The hotel itself is whacked out but very different to anywhere else we've stayed. The room was small enough but perfect for the two of us. The bar is lovely and the tapas are very upmarket. The place is very popular with the locals which is a great sign. We walked everywhere and found the shops very easily. One thing we wish we'd done was book a good restaurant before....every place we went to was fully booked. Try to get a Spanish friend to book!!All in all a great place and will be back in the Summer.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We have just retured from a 3 night long weekend stay in Madrid for my partners 40th birthday. What can i say about this hotel. The location was excellent, we walked everywhere during our stay (Although it was rain rain rain on the saturday). The staff were very very helpful. As it was our 1st time in Madrid we asked the reception staff for some advise on what to see and do. They went out of their way 2 provide us with detailed instructons on the map and gave us advise on where 2 eat tapas etc etc. They were also very helpful in giving us info on where 2 shop, where 2 eat and where 2 go 4 a drink. The room (Superior double) was beautiful and very comfortable. Huge bed, large room and huge walk in shower. Overall our whole experience was excellent and i would definetly recommend this hotel 2 anyone going 2 stay in Madrid, whether it be your 1st tme or not. We will definetly be using the Room Mate chain of hotels when we next visit.

<Content>A great place to stay My wife and I started our honeymoon at the Oscar and found it to be a great hotel. We were able to reach it easily via the Metro from the airport. The location is terrific, central to everything. The staff were fantastic, friendly, efficient and warm. I got sick in Madrid with a bad fever and the Oscar staff helped my wife helped us rework our travel itinerary. The complimentary breakfast is very good. The rooms are comfortable with funky decor. Ask the front desk for the key/handle that will open your bedroom window. Also, your room keycard controls the lights.They have a hotel safe and can provide you with helpful hints about where to go in Madrid. We will definately stay there again.

<Content>absolute value for money This hotel offers fantastic value. Great location, good rooms and a low price. With the free breakfast and wifi, I don't think you can do much better. I personally loved the room (I had a green one), but I can understand that for some people all the design is just not working. The lighting-concept in the room is over-the-top, you can make endless combination of lighting, really fun, but not really necessary. The shower has this thing that I hate so much: you take a shower and the floor in front of the shower gets totally soaked, since the glass door in front of the shower doesn't really fit. I think if this would be your home, you would fix it immediately. I would imagine that since the hotel is open, every single day the water overflows into the bathroom, what a mess. Free wifi: fabulous. Who-ever thought that the black and white design of the breakfast room was a good idea, should not be involved in hotel decoration. Staff was indeed very nice. This is a great choice if you want to do the Chueca-thing for a weekend.

<Content>This hotel redefines stylish vacations with reasonable pricing!!!! This out-of-this-world hotel is not only central located just behind the Gran Via street but it is also reasonably priced. But the most important thing is that all this happens in the most stylish, modern and sooo cosy interior. The rooms, the lobby, the breakfast room...all of them were just as if they got out of an interior design magazine and they were there only for us! I just did not want to leave this hotel...Breakfast is served till 12:00 and this shows that they respect the guest's vacations in the most vibrant capital of the Iberian Peninsula! Oh, and they serve breakfast to die for...and good quality filter coffee...simply excellent!!!! Maria-Eleni  Christos.

<Content>No hot or cold water I really wanted to like the Room Mate Oscar given reviews in travel magazines and on TripAdvisor, but my experience was mixed.On the night I stayed there, after I came back from dinner, there was no hot or cold water, according to the front desk. Also, somehow related to this water problem...the hallway fire alarms beeped for about half an hour in the middle of the night (stopped around 2AM).Luckily, I had already taken a shower before I went out to dinner. The next morning, only the cold water had returned. To the hotel's credit, they only charged me half price. However, I was lucky to be a leisure traveler. If I was a business traveler stuck in a hotel with no water, even half the rate would be too much to pay.Aside from this experience, here's my assessment of the hotel...LOCATION: ~4 minute walk to either the Gran Via or Chueca subway stops. Tons of restaurants nearby, including a tapas bar across the street. ROOM: The room was a good size and clean. However, as other posters have said, the faucets are so hip they are hard to use. Then again, I had no water for most of my stay, so the faucets were useless either way.Also, don't expect AC unless it's summertime. I aired out my room by opening the window, but it's a noisy neighborhood.Rooms have flat screen TVs with English channels, including CNN.INTERNET: Free wireless is available in the rooms. STAFF: The staff I encountered were well-meaning and friendly, but not completely on top of things. They were completely frazzled by the water and beeping alarm problems. Understandable, but in these situations, guests want staff who are calm and who have a plan to fix the problems...

<Content>No Nomination, No Oscar for this Hotel I stayed at Oscar with a friend for 3 nights in November. I've stayed at the Room Mate Laura and Mario before, so decided to give Oscar a go.I was disappointed...I will definitely not be returning. I am cancelling a booking I had at the Oscar for next summer. In fact, the experience has put me off the entire Room Mate chain.First the positives:(1) Price was ok(2) Somewhat funky design(3) Free breakfast/wi-fiNow the negatives:(1) No AC/ventilation in room (the staff said that it was switched on only in summer). This made for a stuffy room that could only be ventilated by opening a window - unfortunately the local area is noisy. So the choice was a ventilated room or peace  quiet...but not both.(2) A strange smell, emanating from the bathroom which got worse as our stay went on. When we complained, we were told the hotel was full (Sat night) so we couldn't be moved. On Sunday the smell was noticeably worse and we insisted on being moved. The staff obliged and we were moved to another, smaller room (Executive rather than the Deluxe we had booked) - effectively a downgrade. When we commented on this downgrade on check-out, the staff insisted we have been given the same room type and offered no discount. We didn't argue - we just wanted to leave asap!(3) Incomplete room/hotel - Upon arrival, the desk chair in our room was missing, there was no door on the wardrobe, etc. This hotel has a feeling that it was opened in a hurry (which is surprising, given how it was meant to open in early 2007 and ended up opening months behind schedule).(4) TV - Strange observation: in our first room there were only Spanish language tv channels available. In the room we moved to, there were only non-Spanish language channels. Why not both? Ok, this is a MINOR point...I don't visit Madrid to watch tv.I wanted to like this hotel, but I come away disappointed. Though the staff were mostly nice, they could have been more sympathetic when we needed help. The hotel has a great location and potential. But it's been opened too quickly and has too many rough edges. Avoid!

<Content>great hotel in chueca Loved this hotel. Very modern and clean throughout. Room was tastefully done in modern furniture and decorations. Front desk staff members were excellent, professional, and friendly. Excellent and healthy buffet and was included in rate- servers were attentive. Hotel was very accomodating with request for better room (wanted one with view of plaza) and assisted with restaurant recommendations/reservations, entertainment and city tours. Centrally located in Chueca with great choices for eating , lots of stores for shopping, and bars/discos nightlife for all tastes - gay and straight, young and old.Will stay here again and looking forward to our next trip to Madrid. Although in the middle of the nightlife and crowd, the hotel room was quiet due to the tripled paned windows ( at least in our room) . Staff mentioned that a pool is being installed on the roof and bar is being created on the ground level . Check to see if completed, if you want to utilize. I recommend for everyone

<Content>would defintely go back again Room Mate Oscar was just over a month old when we came to stay for a long weekend. They are experiencing some teething problems and so did we, initially, with our room. But the management and staff were so charming and helfpul in sorting out our problems that we immediately settled into our stay. The rooms are stylish and original. The bathrooms in particular are great. The location in Chueca with its great shopping and vibrant gay and club scene is spot on. But most of all the staff and management really care about their guests' experience and in my opinion that always results in a good hotel. Looking forward to returning.

<Content>Deserves an minor Oscar A very funkily designed boutique hotel located in the scruffy, but happening Chueca district. Handy for all the bars and restaurants of this trendy area of Madrid, Oscar sets out to impress as soon as you walk into the reception area with friendly and efficient young staff who tone in with the hotel's stylish design.The room we stayed in was a vision in monochrome, with huge naked torsos dominating the main wall - all very tasteful. The mirrored wall behind the bed turned into a glowing headboard at the touch of a switch - very Barbarella!Plenty of room too, with ample storage including a laptop safe and plenty of hanging space. The showerroom had a large cubicle with quality fittings and separate toilet was spacious - the only minor irritation being the double toilet roll holder which insisted on falling on the floor ever time it was used!Minus points: A bit noisy as neighbours' doors bang loudly. Lifts are quite small and a bit slow. Wifi gave up the ghost after one day.Plus points: Great location. Nice lazy breakfast. Style a go-go! Relaxed staff. Comfy beds. Quality fixtures and supplies (towels and sheets are lovely). Low Price (though this could be an introductory offer situation).
