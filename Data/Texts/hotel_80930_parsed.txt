<Content>Basic but a great stay Stayed in this hotel for a weekend in March, found the hotel, staff and rooms all fine. Only gripe I had was the charge for the car park which I wasnt told about when I booked, but the charge was probably less than parking on the street. Location of this hotel is great, about 10 mins walk from fishermans wharf, etc. Also easy access for the city centre and airport.  The room, bedding and bathroom were clean with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Breakfast was basic and limited seating, but for a budget hotel it was fine. Choice of OJ, tea and coffee, bagels, pastries, toast, muffins (which were delicious) cereals, fruit and waffles (loved those too!)Would recommend the hotel for those who are on a budget or dont mind where they stay. I'd definately return.

<Content>Don't Stay Here, Worst Customer Service Ever Hotel is average, stuff are rude and unfriendly. Beware hidden costs like charges for safes whether you use them or not. Also they completely rob you with phone charges. Had to make an emergency phone call after my wallet was stolen and they charged $51 for a 2 minute phonecall to an international land line, a rip off by any hotel standards. When asked to justify this extortionate amount, the staff and manager were both rude. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>Comfortable, Friendly, and good location The Comfort Inn by the Bay was exactly what we hoped it would be when we booked it. It is well located and the views are wonderful. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgable and made our stay there very pleasant. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable; We really enjoyed are stay here, and will stay here again and again :-)

<Content>Not good for the lone traveller Found staff quite unfriendly - agree with other reviews that they certainly did not go out of their way to be of any help- sighs of annoyance were given when I asked for help with making a local call.The room was adequate- but very noisy. Was kept awake by snoring from the room next door- yes the walls are that thin! And then there was the bathrooms being used above and next door- lovely! Plus people going past door at night- the whole place seemed to be badly built for any peace and quiet.Breakfast was adequate- nothing exciting I'm afraid.The cost of the safe- they tried that one on me. Like others I'd signed for my room whilst jet lagged. So on checking out was told I had to pay for safe in room- which I didn't ask for or use. But you signed for it- $1.75 per day plus tax. On reading form, it only stated $1.75 plus tax- which is all I offered them as they were not entitled to charge on a daily rate as it did not stipulate it. I got away with not paying at all as I was right!!As a single traveller this is not a good location for meals out or venturing out on your own. Although roads appeared safe, I didn't feel comfortable being out after dark. There is no restaurant attached to hotel, so you can be at a loss as to where to eat etc. Daily excursions are fine- and you can walk down to the Piers in 15 mins.Would not recommend staying there- unfriendly staff, noisy, average rooms and little nightlife in the surrounding area. Just seemed to be keen to charge you for every little thing.As an extra- they will happily book you a taxi to the airport- and they have an agreement with the firm, so that will also cost you a fortune- about $35 one way. Shuttle buses are excellent value and will cost you $16 each way, door to door.

<Content>Great place to stay We stayed at this hotel as first-timers to San Francisco and would highly recommend going back there again.The location on Van Ness avenue is within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and a cheap bus ride away from the Golden Gate Bridge.What really made our stay great apart from the decent sized room was the staff member called Sharon, who went out of her way to help us organise our daily trips (eg how to get to Golden Gate Bridge for US$1.50 - the bus!!) and provided handy recommendations on possible activities that might interest us.Otherwise, the other staff performed their jobs adequately but were largely indifferent to our requests and questions. These guys could do with some courtesy training, but if you do stay there, make sure you ask for Sharon and you will definitely be looked after.

<Content>Great value for money Stayed here for 6 nights in Nov 2008. We upgraded on arrival (I think $30 plus tax per night) to get a room on a higher floor and with a bay view - definitely worth it. Our room was large with two double beds plus seating area. It was comfortable and always clean. Some of the decor was a bit dated, but I've stayed in far worse 4 star hotels.The hotel is on a busy junction, so it is worth either getting a higher floor or a room at the back. Otherwise, the location is great with buses very close, cable cars 10 mins walk away and Fisherman's Wharf 10-15 mins walk.The breakfast was adequate. I think some people were forgetting it was COMPLIMENTARY and were expecting eggs and bacon freshly cooked every morning. We never had a problem getting a table.Coffee is available all day in the breakfast room.The car park is tight and I was glad I had someone to guide me out. It costs $22 per night but compared to other car parks in SF, it's cheap. BTW, there are Hertz and Avis offices in Fisherman's Wharf only 15 mins walk away.You pay for the safe whether or not you use it. By the way, they don't tell you that they will charge you, they just ask you to initial something when you are cheecking in, tired and jet-lagged.Contrary to the hotel's own website, there is not a computer kiosk for guest use, so if you want to check-in on line for your flight home, there is an internet cafe about 3 blocks along Van Ness which is very cheap.There is a great Italian cafe/restaurant over the road on Lombard - cheap (for SF), fresh food but not licensed for alcohol.This was a cheap hotel to stay in and we got excellent value for money. If you want 5 star, stay in the Ritz Carlton and pay their prices. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Scruffy and old with great views The room was not really clean: mold around the window and in the bathroom, burst curtains, ditry carpet and very old and worn out accommodation. Def. needs a facelift and a cleaning. The staff was kind of rude and we had to pay for the roomsafe, doesn麓t matter if we use it or not. Breakfast was kind of ok, but the waitress kept removing the food and plates before the breakfast-hours were over. The maid woke us up around 7a.m. to clean our room and we also spent USD 30 for parking in the hotel garage. So altogehter a dirty and expensive hotel, with bad service but great views on the Golden Gate Bridge. But for us def. a never come back hotel. (One star for the hotel itself, second star for the view)

<Content>Good value for money My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for three nights before flying on to Hawaii. I had read previous reviews and was not expecting anything great. We arrived about midday after a ten hour flight from the UK. The reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, from offering to book tours for us to arranging our taxi back to the airport. They offered advice on where to go and how to get there. We had been upgraded to a room on a higher floor with a view to the Golden Gate bridge with two large queen sized beds. The room was a good size and everything was clean. As soon as we had sorted ourselves out we made our way to Fisherman's Wharf which was a short walk down a moderate hill. The next morning we had breakfast and, yes, it was a bit crowded but people were coming and going all the time so you could get a seat or share with someone else. The breakfast was adequate with pastries, eggs, muffins, toast, etc and the coffee was very good. We found this ample to start us off for the day. Beds were very comfy and hotel had supplied shampoo, etc. We thought the area was very good with close proximity to Fisherman's Wharf and glad we picked the hotel. Would recommend the hotel as perfectly adequate, after all you only sleep there! Would stay there again if ever visiting SF again.

<Content>Nice room, great view First of all, if this is your first trip to SF, pay the extra charge for the upper floor with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Even if it's a little foggy, you still have a great view of the surrounding area. The room was a little smaller than other places we stayed on our trip, but was upscale, very clean and extremely comfortable. Being from the midwest, I balked at the price until I researched other rhotels in the area - found it to be reasonably priced in comparison. The view from our 10th floor room was incredible! Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, the ocean, etc. Beautiful! Bus stop one block away. (We walked the three blocks up Lombard to catch the cable car - don't do it....thought I was going to die! Talk about steep!!) Hotel staff was courteous and helpful. Hotel itself was a pleasant stay. However!.....while the car park was secure, it was also ridiculously small. We were driving a Kia and it still took us 2-3 ties to make some of the corners. Anything over a compact car will have a lot of difficulty navigating in there and full-sized vehicles can forget it! And the privilege of parking in this rat maze will cost you $26 per day. But they did let us keep our car there until 4 pm even though we checked out at 11 am.

<Content>Pretty good and fairly priced There no good reason not to stay at the Comfort Inn, since it's not bad at all and prices are reasonable for SF. The location itself is great if you want to see the greater SF area.When we arrived we could park our car next to the front door and were able to get the bags out easily (we parked it later).The check-in was fast and although the staff is not a happy bunch, they were courteous enough.The room on the 6th floor had a good view of the Bridge, which we ordered. Ours was at the end of the hall way next to a rather noisy ice machine, which could be heard in the room. It explained the 'do not unplug this machine' sign. I was tempted though.The beds were soft enough, the bath room was clean, but we found a sticky carpet near the window since somebody dropped a soda on it before us. We reported it, but it remained sticky for all three days.Parking in the hotel garage can be a bit challenging if you have anything over a compact. So be prepared.The hotel is in driving distance from scenic Lombard Street and in walking distance from the Bay (without steep hills).We founds lots of restaurants on Chestnut close by, many other motels can be found there as well. And we didn't skip Mel's diner on Lombard for a hearty breakfast.Sure, this place could be better. But the things we encountered were no biggies. We'd choose the Comfort Inn again when we go back to San Francisco. We had three good night's sleep.

<Content>Didn't disappoint A friend and I stayed at this hotel recently and had a wonderful time! Our room was a double and plenty big for two people. We had a wonderful view of Golden Gate Bridge (room 907), were just 2 blocks from the Crookedest Street, and were about 6-8 blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. All in all, we thought it was a great location. The bus line ran right in front of the hotel, which was really nice.Pros: Friendly staff, clean room, very comfortable beds, good shower pressure, free Internet in the room. Cons: the deluxe continental breakfast left something to be desired. The make-your-own waffles were really good, but the only other things offered were hard boiled eggs, toast, 2 kinds of cereal, a danish (the same kind every day), and fresh apples or oranges. I would have preferred a little more selection, but it was free and probably saved me about $10 a day in breakfast at a restaurant.Otherwise, I was perfectly happy. We didn't have a car to park, which seems to be a big complaint, and ask for an odd-numbered room so you have a decent view. We took the BART and a bus (with all our luggage) to the hotel. Don't recommend that! It was about 5 blocks from the BART to the bus stop鈥攈ard to navigate with luggage, and took us 1 1/2 hours to get to the hotel once our plane landed. The hotel offered a shuttle back to the airport for $45 total, so we took that deal for the ride home. It took just 1/2 hour to get us to the airport.I'd stay here again.

<Content>avoid if you want to feel good about your stay in s fran. The car park is a rat hole and it does not help when you have several large suitcases and stairs to negotiate to the lift.On arrival at check in we had wait while our room was prepared along with about twenty other travelers , there was no where to sit although the open plan dining area was free but no one suggested we could sit there.10 minutes after the check in time late -4pm-we had to insist that we were given a room as we had been waiting so long.The lady on the desk was brusque and treated everyone in the same manner,more like school children than paying guests.The room was adequate but did not feel clean and the windows giving the golden gate bridge view were filthy.The pillows needed tipping in the bin.The breakfast -included in the price, to make up we hoped, for the $26 charge to park per night was not a viable prospect,the toaster was broken,the waffle maker had a queue and no batter in it,the coffee was awful and the staff spent more time putting on tables notes of whom they were, obviously anxious for a tip,rather than refilling the vital breakfast items.We gave up trying to get breakfast.The location was adequate but overrated and there were several down and outs hanging on the corner of the street opposite.

<Content>Average Comfort I stayed here with my husband and teenage daughter at the end of July for 3 nights as the first stop on our around the world tour.The hotel is convenient for viewing Fishermans' Wharf, the crooked road and to get to trams.The room we were given had a wonderful view of the Golden Gate Bridge and we had no complaints regarding the size or cleanliness.The biggest problem was breakfast time! This only ran until 9.30 and so everyone headed down at 9am arrving at the same time. The breakfast room was just not large enough to hold everyone so there was an overflow into the reception area. One morning we ended up eating out there on sofas, hoping that a table would turn up eventually. The breakfast buffet was pleasant enough, but it was a bit of a scramble amongst all the other guests (who'd arrived at the same time!!)Comfort Inn - you need to sort this out with an extension!Anyway, a nice hotel for the price, but head down early for breakfast!!

<Content>Ice Vest Needed This place does have a great view, but what it is lacking is true air conditioning. I stayed in a top floor premier room. The rate is good for San Francisco, but my stay was sheer hell as the temperature never dropped below 80 Fahrenheit even with the curtains closed all day  the air conditioning (so-called) blasting on full all day. Even at dead of night when it was 20F cooler outside I was still sweltering. For anyone with the slightest lack of fitness or any problems of heart or respiration I suspect this could be a mortal concern. The windows no longer open and the nice view is no good if your next holiday check-in is to the nearest hospital. I am here another two nights and hope I survive for the delight of leaving.

<Content>A Big Disappointment After reading all of the reviews, I cannot believe the hotel that we stayed at and the one described in the reviews are the same.Negative points:* Room was tiny! I have stayed in larger rooms in Europe. The bathroom was so small, the open door almost touched the toilet.* We had an inside room facing the wall of the building next to it. So, not only did we not have any room in this room, we also had absolutely no view. It seems from the other reviews that the outside rooms with the view were large and spacious. If you are going to stay in this hotel, I would make sure to ask for one of those rooms and not leave it to chance that you would get a room like ours.* The beds need to be updated. The linens were very old and pilly. And the mattress was lumpy.* I just didn't feel that this was a clean room.* Parking is $26 / day. This didn't really bother me as it is a price to pay for visiting a large city. What I found a problem with is that they said when we returned in the evening there might not be a place for the car and we would have to find alternative parking. Luckily that wasn't the case, but the fact that we had to worry about that was disappointing.* We were told that we would have to pay $2 / day to use the in room safe. That seems unreasonable. Why should we have to pay and how do they know whether we used it or not?* Breakfast only went to 9:30.Good points:* Staff was nice. I was so disappointed in our room that I asked to move. The first night they were completely full so we had no option but to stay in that room. They did offer to move us the second night, but at that point, we had too much stuff to move, so we just stayed where we were.* Shower pressure was good.Overall, I was very disappointed and did not find this worth my money. I would rather have paid more money for a nicer, cleaner hotel. I would not recommend this to a friend or coworker.

<Content>Great hotel for the money We just returned from vacation in northern CA. Comfort Inn by the Bay was a great hotel for the value. It's about a 5-10 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf right by Lombard Street. We had a terrific King suite which was surprisingly spacious. The continental breakfast was a typical breakfast. Staff was outstanding- always helpful with directions and suggestions. Another plus was the overnight parking cost about half of nearby hotels. Overall, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Location and View Overall, our hotel stay was good. It is in a great location, about a 15 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The breakfast area was nice with lots of tables, and the food selection ok. The bathroom was pretty small. Be careful of the parking garage. First, the parking fee is $26, and the parking is very tight. We had a minivan, and manauvering was very difficult. Also, there are two flights of stairs from the parking garage to the elevator in the lobby, so you will have to carry up all your luggage. You may want to consider unloading from the street out in front, before parking in the garage. Other than that, we were very happy with our stay, and with the view from out window.

<Content>Made Our Stay a Great One! A REAL hotel (not a noisy motor lodge) with excellent friendly staff, a comfortable lobby, a convenient free lite-breakfast buffet, and a super location near Fisherman's Wharf (but away from the noise and bustle), and close to public transportation. Do yourself a BIG favor and book an odd-numbered room on a high floor. The expansive view from your own room of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin Highlands and the Bay full of boats and windsurfers will be one of the highlights of your trip--and the upgrade will cost you less than most tours. Another good investment is a multi-day public transportation pass, useable on all trolleys and buses (available at the trolley stop at Beach  Hyde. Pay $3 more for a map of the system.) DO use the buses and trolleys to take you UP the hills. Our favorite places: Muir Woods, Coit Tower (check out the view and WPA murals), the Ferry Terminal (full of cafes, bread, wine, cheese and chocolate shops), the Maritime Museum on Hyde St. Pier (go down into the Balclutha and see how the Captain and the poor Chinese sailors lived), North Beach (great restaurants and cafes), the trolley rides, and, yes, the sea lions on Pier 39. Skip Chinatown. Have Fun!

<Content>Comfort Inn by the Bay I recently had a four night stay at the Comfort Inn by the Bay and was very pleased with the quality of the accomodations for the price. The hotel is situated on Van Ness and is approximately a 15 minute walk from the wharf, so it was a good starting point for seeing the wharf, alcatraz, ghiradelli square, and Lombard. It is near a few bus lines, which we used to go to a baseball game, and within a ten minute walk or so of the cable cars. We did find that it is far enough from the BART station that a cab is required to take public transport to the airport, however (although there may be a bus that runs there). The rooms were very clean, and the interior decorations (bedspreads, carpets, etc) seemed fairly new. The only downside to the room was the bathroom. The tub/shower and toilet were in separate room (vanity on the outside) that was extremely cramped and the tub/shower curtains, etc. could have used an update. Other than that, we were very pleased with the accomodation for the price (we also had a great view of the golden gate bridge from our window) and enjoyed the free breakfast. The only other thing I would mention is that while there were a few places to eat near the hotel, the areas that had a lot of restaurants and nightlife were at least a 10-15 minute walk, which might be a consideration if you tend to stay out late and would like to be able to walk back to the hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel!! This is probably one of the nicest hotels I've had the pleasure to stay in for a very long time! Its been recently renovated and beautifully done. We stayed on the 10th floor with a fantastic view of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a quiet and beautiful room with refrigerator and trouble free internet service. Its a great location near Fishermans Wharf and buses run by frequently so no car is needed to travel this city! Don't forget to check out Cafe Lombard thats located right across the street from the hotel. Best italian food I've had in a long time and they do serve breakfast til 11 a.m.Comfort Inn by the Bay gets my top rating in first class accommodations, value, professional staff and overall friendliness!

<Content>Great Location! This was my first trip to San Francisco - and I wanted a hotel near enough to major attractions, within easy reach of public transportation, but not in the heart of a highly touristy area. Comfort Inn By the Bay was perfect! Located at the corner of Van Ness and Lombard Streets, it's on the bus line, walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and only 3 blocks from the Powell-Hyde Cable Car line (uphill all the way, but definitely worth it). The cable car stop at Powell and Lombard is at the top of the World's Crookedest street - a must see! If the climb up doesn't take your breath away, the view at the top will. Like all Comfort Inns, there's a free breakfast buffet with make-your-own waffles, cereal, danish, toast, muffins, fresh fruit, juice, coffee  tea. Not a huge selection, but enough to get you started. The selection doesn't change, so it could get boring if you were there for more than a couple of days running. Staff was friendly, helpful and came up with a great local restaurant suggestion for Thai food within walking distance. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Make sure you have good security! We booked this hotel because we knew the area was in a good tourist spot. The stay was okay, older appliances and some things weren't as good as thought. The last night of our 3 day stay our car got broken into in their gated garage, with cameras. If you stay here make sure you don't pay to leave your car in their garage. Turn it in and save money on rental and parking. They were less than friendly with our cituation and hardly helped us out. We're still working out the damage costs and loss to us.

<Content>Bring your own can of Raid!! This was the 4th time I have stayed at this hotel in the last 7 years. I chose it because it has a great location for tourist spots although there aren't many places to eat around there. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but they do have a breakfast area. I decided to book myself and 2 colleagues here because it was budget friendly and I knew the locale and as we were on business we had a tight budget. What a disappointment this turned out to be. I paid extra for a view of the bridge, my friends didn't and they got a view of a parking lot. The wall in my room was covered with mildew as were the curtains but then again so were my friend's rooms. The room seemed clean enough but on the second day I was there I noticed about a dozen or so tiny tiny bugs crawling all over the flush tank of my toilet. I called to the front desk at 7 am when I noticed them and asked them to send someone up to check it out, I had to call again at 8 am and at 9 am I went out to the hallway and found the housekeeper. I told her what the problem was and she said she had it on her board to do. She also said she couldn't spray the room until I left. I was at meetings all that day and with a major conference in the city couldn't get another hotel to go to. I also didn't want to separate from my colleagues. I did leave the room and was gone for 5 hours. When I came back, my room still hadn't been touched. I called the front desk and asked to speak with the manager and was told he was helping someone else but would call me back within 5 minutes. I waited almost 1/2 hour and eventually went downstairs to the lobby. I didn't want to discuss this in front of other guests but was really pushed to do so. The manager was apalled and said this was the first he'd heard of it. He assured me the room would be done immediately and the bathroom would be sprayed. He couldn't tell me what these creatures were. I had an event that evening and when I came back at 1 am I noticed they were still there and still as many of them as when I left earlier in the day. I called downstairs and at 2 am I had to pack up my things and move to another room. I checked out that following morning. When I mentioned to the front desk staff she said it was my fault because I had eaten a banana in the room the day before and these were fruit flies. I actually work in the Health Dept. and explained to her that fruit flies need more than 12 hours to incubate and that fruit flies fly, these little critters were crawling and weren't even near the garbage can that I had used. The staff at the front desk were less than helpful with things I needed (ie FedEx form for a package I needed to send). I was so paranoid about bringing something home with me that I emptied my suitcase in the garage and even the new sweaters etc. that I bought I washed and dried immediately before I would bring them into the house. This was the worst treatment I have ever received. I only signed on to this site so I could warn others what this place is really like. The pictures must be years old and really do not represent what this hotel is really like. Stay away, it isn't worth your hard earned money or the grief of wondering if you caught something.

<Content>Loved Fisherman's Wharf We were quite happy with this hotel although we did not realise before we arrived that there was no restaurant. Breakfast was good and an easy walk or bus ride down to Fisherman's Wharf which we loved. The staff were very friendly and helpful and luckily for us the weather was just perfect! The trip to Yosemite was awesome. (We were travelling from New Zealand)

<Content>Walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf This was our first stop on a 2 week trip to northern California. The first 2 nights we had a room facing another tall building, but the next 2 nights we upgraded to a Bay view room with a fantastic vista including the Golden Gate bridge and Alcatraz island. They let us store our luggage in their office while we continued our touring of the City.The included continental breakfast was better than most mid-range hotels. Three of the four front desk staff that we talked with were VERY helpful in providing directions, suggesting restaurants, reimbursing us for lost money in the soda machine, etc. The 4th clerk acted like he hated his job - so we avoided talking with him.It is good that we did not yet have a car, because parking in the hotel's basement garage is very expensive. But when we picked up our rental car to start on the remainder of our vacation, the staff let us park for free while we loaded our luggage.The famous twisted road on Lombard Street is only 3 blocks from the hotel - but it is like walking up a cliff at almost a 30% slope! We learned that the frequent buses on Van Ness Avenue in front of the hotel will get you almost anywhere in the City with ease, and for only $1.50. Definitely worth it to save your legs on the hills.

<Content>Thought it a Shabby Hotel, In Need of Renovation This place is old and desperately in need of renovation. There was no refrigerator, nor microwave. Our toilet seat was broken. The windows are screwed shut and can't be opened. Our courtyard view was in reality no courtyard, but plants planted along the street.Sad to say, they have a great location, but need to spend monies on renovation.The internet photos aren't representative of the run down condition of the rooms, hallways, etc.

<Content>Cheap and cheerlful We're not a full service hotel. said the man on the desk. As long as you keep that in mind you'll be happy. Good location, basic rooms, but a good size and some with views of the Bridge. Breakfast is included, but the breakfast rooms got very busy at times.Would rather stay elsewhere, but for the money this one wasn't too bad.

<Content>You wont do better Stayed for a full two weeks in September-October 07.  Great location(just 10 minutes walk from Fishermans Wharf, in my book all the better for being a little bit away from the touristy area of the city). Good for buses, tours, walking, atm, and a few restaurants. Room. More spacious than hotel rooms at this price in Europe. Spotless, good housekeeping, quiet and really really comfortablebreakfast is good but there is a shortage of tables at peak time. You have to just ask people to share.staff are helpful, (particularly Mark at the front desk.) stayed in hotels a lot more expensive than this in SF, but this is just great quality and value. will stay here again

<Content>Perfect Stay I didn't know what to expect when I booked this hotel, but I was very pleased with my stay here. I booked the cheapest price I could find on their website and it was a smoking room. I do not smoke and have asthma so I was a little worried. When I got to the room, it was very clean and no trace of smoking anywhere. The hotel overall smelled and looked clean. It is a great location, Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf hotels look like they would be too noisy in my opinion. This hotel is only three blocks from the bay! Close to all public transportation. The breakfast is so-so but enough to get you going and to not worry about finding a place for breakfast. The staff was pleasant and friendly. They helped me find my way around. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. I would stay here again.

<Content>Great Location! While traveling down the PCH from Bellingham, WA to San Diego, CA we made reservations for and stayed at the Comfort Inn By the Bay in San Francisco for two nights.Other than having to pay an additional $26 per night for parking, we enjoyed our stay. The hotel was within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf but also right on the MUNI line for those not wishing to walk (we use the MUNI to return to the hotel after an exhausting day of touring the city).

<Content>Good value and service Comfort Inn By The Bay - San Francisco: Good ValueReviewer: James Lam, SingaporeJust came back after four days' stay in Comfort Inn. The location is very convenient with many buses plying along Van Ness Ave. You can practically go to any part of San Francisco by bus. The room was ready when we arrived at 12 noon which was very convenient. It was very clean with white bath towels and bed sheets. Two complaints (water flow of the bath tub and toilet flushing system) were fixed quickly to our satisfaction. However, we did not tell them that the heating system was not working (maybe it's still summer).The complimentary breakfast was good and adequate. Hot waffles and fresh fruits are welcome items at any hotel breakfasts. Sharon at the front desk provided excellent service. She provided information on tourist sites, what bus to take, what bus tickets to buy and even gave us a bus guide.Will definitely stay in this hotel on our next visit to San Francisco.

<Content>Just OK This is a high rise (11 floors) hotel a block from Lombard Street (the crooked street) and an easy walk to Chinatown. We were on the top floor, but the traffic noise was still pretty loud. The room was adequate, but certainly not spacious. The breakfast room was large, but very crowded. (They should have five or six wafflemakers, not one or two.) All in all, an OK hotel but nothing to write home about.

We had a room to the back of the hotel, no view but no noise, slept like a log for the three nights! I would recommend researching the transport system and using it! its a fair climb up lombard!

<Content>An excellent base from which to explore San Francisco When it came to booking accommodation in San Francisco it became clear hotels are generally pretty expensive there. I used TripAdvisor to research and eventually whittled it down to the Comfort Inn by the Bay as:the price was good (I booked using HotelPronto.com and paid about 拢80 per night for the room including complimentary breakfast).The hotel was pleasant enough. The rooms were clean and quite large. I asked for a room on a higher floor, as the hotel is on the junction of Van Ness Avenue and Lombard Street so quite a lot of traffic. I was given room on 9th floor which was fine and noise wasn't a problem at all. Some rooms have a view of the Golden Gate Bridge - mine didn't but I didn't bother paying to upgrade (glad I didn't as fog would have obscured the bridge most of the time anyway).Location was very good, about a 10 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf (walk back took a bit longer as mostly uphill). A few bus services stop on Van Ness very near to the hotel and these make it easy to get to Fishermans Wharf or into the city itself.Breakfast was okay - but the room did get pretty crowded and cramped.Staff were very friendly and helpful at this hotel and I would definitely consider staying there again.

<Content>Functional Nothing to really get too excited about. The room was very clean and the breakfast was ok. It was in a great location - about 10 minutes walk to the Wharf. We found the parking bays to be limited and very small (we had a People Carrier and struggled to get in and out). The only complaint was that there wasn't enough room in the dining area, people were eating cereal in the hotel lobby!

<Content>great location, good price! We stayed here for 4 nights in August, after looking at a bunch of different hotels on tripadvisor. We selected this one based on the positive reviews, the price and most of all the location!We had a double room, with bridge view. The Golden Gate bridge isn't exactly very nearby, but it was clearly visible from our window. Very nice. The street below was a bit noisy, but not in a disturbing way. We slept very well all nights.The hotel is within walking distance (downhill) of the Fisherman's Wharf area. If you're not too tired and in ok shape, it takes about 15 minutes to get there. There is also a busstop not far from the hotel, and with the excellent public transportation (get a MUNI passport!), you could anywhere easily.Breakfast is cool - you make your own waffles! Additionally there's hot or cold cereal, bagels, muffins, juices, fruit, coffee/tea/cocoa. Nothing incredibly fancy, and not everything is very healthy perse, but it fills the stomach! Parking is a bit expensive - $26 + tax per night, however, it is in a sealed, secure parking garage underneath the hotel. You're not guaranteed a spot though. I'm not sure if it makes a difference, but we arrived on a monday, and had no trouble finding an empty spot. Once in, leave your car there for the whole stay, and use public transportation. It prevents frustration :)All in all, we'd definitely come back again!

<Content>Great location and value We stayed at the Comfort Inn by the Bay in June this year and found the hotel excellent value for money. The location was great if you wanted to see all the attractions at Fishermans Wharf and there was a bus stop just a couple of yards up the road if you wanted to travel downtown. The guy on the front desk was really brilliant, he gave us some part used Muni passes for free which came in very useful. The front desk staff were all really helpful with tourist info etc. and very friendly. There are not a lot of pubs nearby for a night time unless you want to walk to Fishermans Wharf but the buses run 24/7 so travelling 10mins to downtown or fishermans wharf was not a problem. When visiting S F you have to experience the cable cars, they are a great fun experience, but do have the most miserable drivers I have come across, having travelled all over the world. We found them rude and unhelpful, not a good advert for S F tourism. If you go downtown, stop off at Lefty O,Doules, right next to the Handlery Hotel off Union Square. Great entertainment cheap food and possibly one of the best barmen in the world.

<Content>Great place to stay on a moderate budget We were looking for a comfortable, clean hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf area that also included a free breakfast, and we found it in Comfort Inn by the Bay. The room was on the 7th floor, was very quiet, and was large enough for the two of us. The free breakfast was a tremendous asset and we looked forward to beginning our day at the breakfast buffet. The waffles, cereal, bagels, English muffins, hard boiled eggs, and banana nut muffins were very satisfying. Fruit, coffee and juice were also included. We would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Mark (at front desk) was exceptional! I can only echo what others have said about this property. Customer service was outstanding -- Mark, at the front desk, gave us much personal attention and advice, and even gave us partly-unused Muni Passes when we were hurrying to catch bus 47 for our Alcatraz tour. We paid a bit extra for a top-floor room to take advantage of the bay and bridge views. The view is grand (although the bridge was a bit further away than I expected), but the windows could have used a good washing. The room had average motel-type furnishings, and the bathroom was very small, but everything was clean and the housekeeping staff was very nice. The breakfast room was very crowded, (the hotel was full) and finding a table for the four of us was quite a feat. Breakfast was quite substantial and kept us going for a good part of the day, though a little more protein and less starch might have been a good idea. I'm not sure this establishment offers a good value for the rates charged, but San Francisco hotels (unfortunately) seem to be uniformly overpriced.

<Content>Good location, average hotel, don't pay extra for the bridge view My family of 5 stayed here for 3 nights earlier this month and were generally satisfied. The location at Lombard and Van Ness is very easy to get to and walking distance from Fisherman's wharf. We took the #30 bus to a Giants game. Hotel rooms are very average with small bathrooms. We had a family of 5 with 2 double beds plus a rollaway and it was tight but not a problem. Don't pay extra for a higher floor with a view of the bridge - it is not that good a view. The parking garage is very small and difficult to maneuver but we got our minivan in and out repeatedly. Go early to breakfast - it gets very crowded during the last hour from 8:30-9:30.

<Content>Wonderful stay in the city by the bay!! Me and my mother stayed at the Comfort Inn By The Bay while on vacation in San Francisco. We were very impressed with this hotel. The breakfast was great. Our room was perfect. The beds were very comfortable. Our room view of the Golden Gate Bridge was beautiful and they were so helpful when we needed something or needed directions. The hotel is in a great vicinity in relation to where the touristy places are; ie: Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Ghirardelli Square..just hop on bus 47 and it takes you there!When we go back to SF, we will DEFINITELY stay here again!!! Loved it!! Great for a budget vacation!!!

<Content>good location for budget conscious My family of five stayed here for 3 nights beginning August 1. The hotel is located at Van Ness and the famous Lombard Street. From here, Fisherman's Wharf is very walkable, and it is right on the bus line. No car needed, but read further.Staff was very courteous and helpful. Breakfast was standard, and the rooms were somewhat small but clean and orderly. The only issue was that we had confirmed a rollaway bed thru the hotel website, but the staff said that these accomodations should be made directly with the hotel. Thus, we had to make do without.Cafe Lombard (italian) right across the street is a fine place to dine; don't expect 5 star service, and there is no wine or booze.We looked into a bus trip to Muir Woods, but the fare for five was too much, so we looked into renting a car for the day. We opted for City Rental, and it proved to be an excellent choice. They bring the car to you, it's cheap, and it is an easy drive over the Golden Gate and beyond.For a neat inexpensive lunch and people watching experience, try Tait's on Fishermans Wharf. (No credit cards).Would stay at this hotel again, but would look into others as well.

<Content>Did the job This hotel was booked via a travel agent for a first time visit to the US and to San Francisco.The room was comfortable and perfectly adequate. We hadn't booked a room with a view, but it didnt' matter as we were out and about every day. The Comfort Inn is nice and handy to everything. We walked to Ghiradelli Square and Fishermans Wharf, and it was very easy to catch the Muni bus on Van Ness to just about anywhere. It was a handy location for tour bus pickup.The staff were friendly and helpful with great tips like getting to breakfast early and where to find certain shops.I did have a couple of minor issues. It was great to have coffee in the room, but would have rather had a little container of UHT milk instead of powdered whitener. Also, at the conclusion of my stay, I needed to get three bags plus my baby daughter to the street to catch a shuttle, and I was alone, so could have really done with a bell hop!Otherwise I would be happy to recommend this hotel to those looking for something clean and comfortable that basically gets the job done.

Nice clean room, good breakfast, friendly staff. Walking distance to Lombard street, Cable Cars, Pier 39. You have to pay for parking but it was worth it. The day we checked out, we were allowed to leave our vehicle in the garage until we were ready to leave San Francisco. Overall a great place to stay with families!

<Content>Wonderful Customer Service The Comfort Inn by the Bay was a great place to stay. The entire staff -- from housekeeping to the front desk -- was friendly, helpful and extremely courteous. I had a Bridge View room (rather than a Garden View room) which looked out over Lombard Street and if not for the fog, would have had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. The room was nothing special (and the bathroom was very small) but it was immaculate. The hotel website states that rooms have a desk, but that's not accurate. The room had no desk, but only a very small round table. High speed internet access was available at no charge. I was there on a business trip, so I would have preferred a real desk, but everything else was so pleasant that I wasn't bothered by the lack of a proper work space. Parking in San Francisco is difficult and pricey, and parking at the Comfort Inn by the Bay is no exception. The hotel has a very small number of parking spaces available for guests in an underground garage at a rate of $26 plus tax per day. The garage is very small and difficult to manuever. I had a small car, so parking was manageable, but I think a large car or truck would have some difficulty. Overall, my stay was very pleasant and I will probably book a room there again in the future.

<Content>Not great !! Staff friendly enough. Breakfast buffet was a free-for-all as to whether you could get seated or not. Not a great choice of fare on offer.'by the Bay' stretching a point somewhat as a fair walk to get by the Bay !Not many eateries close to hand - we were advised to catch a bus !View from room was straight at a wooden wall of the building next door - is this special treatment for Brits? Still only there 3 nights - wouldn't want to stop any longer.San Fran worth visiting - be prepared for hills - or long wait for trams.Alcatraz was very thought provoking and should be a definite on anybody's list of to do things. It's how prisons should be - a punishment not a holiday camp !!

<Content>Good location, middling hotel The Comfort Inn is located on a busy stretch of the 101 as it turns from Van Ness Ave onto Lombard Street and heads towards the Golden Gate Bridge. From our room on the 9th floor you could see (through dirty windows) the Golden Gate Bridge and a partial view of Alcatraz. Reception was polite,though not friendly, and the room was basic, clean but not especially nice. Don't think that being high up means no street noise- it seemed to be coming through the air con, so perhaps round the back of the hotel would be best for light sleepers? In addition the walls were quite thin, but luckily we had reasonably quiet neighbors.Parking is $28; if you have a large vehicle use the lot at the side; it didn't fill up while we were there. The hotel seems to attract coach parties; there wasn't a day when there wasn't a coach outside when we were there. This added to chaos at breakfast; finding a seat was nearly impossible, and choice was acceptable,if a little stodgy. The breakfast staff were militant about clearing away the room: if you arrive 5 minutes before breakfast ends that is too late! They seemed to forget that a hotel stands or falls by the service it provides its guests. The location seemed fairly safe at night and it is only a 25 minute brisk walk to Fisherman's Wharf or a very steep hill climb to reach the trolley stop at the summit of Lombard St, where the wiggly road is.For the price, if you keep expectations low, it is an acceptable place to stay but could be so much better with just a little TLC and a hospitality course.

<Content>Spectacular fireworks We actually stopped by the motel six months ago to reserve one of the top floor rooms for the 4th of July fireworks. This is one of the few establishments which will guarantee requests. Because of the holiday traffic and tremendous number of visitors in town, we had to pay the rack rate of $179 + 14% tax, and $26 a night for parking + tax. This is a bit steep but the in your face double fireworks easily compensated. Good walkers will appreciate the location of the motel, as the Cannery and Ghiradelli Square are within 15 minutes or less.A number of restaurants were closed on the 4th so the challenge of finding a good place to eat became even greater. Union Street has the greatest number of eateries. Good bar scene at Perry's, the watering hole popular during the 60's. We settled on the very popular Betelnut, seven blocks down Union St., an Asian restaurant which offers good value and a vibrant ambiance.There are a few problems which you may wish to note so that your own experiences won't be hindered. For example, the bathroom sign to recycle towels or room notice not to change sheets remain ignored. All four sets of towels were replaced and all sheets were changed. Then there is the parking issue. Getting into the secure garage is fine. You announce your arrival in a speaker, and the gate rises. Exiting is a different story. The gate remained down despite having checked out. After 10 minutes, someone went around to the entrance and used the arrival speaker to get the desk to respond.The rooms are bright and the beds are very comfortable. I'm sure that someday the management will do something about worn carpets and soiled chairs. Until then, this is clearly a three-circle experience, but one which we will gladly repeat.

<Content>A Handy Base The Comfort Inn was just what I expected: clean, basic accomodation, a good base for exploring San Francisco.The staff were polite and happy to answer questions about the area, there are bus stops close by and the cable car stops at the crooked part of Lombard - 2 blocks away.The breakfast was nice - especially the waffles. I thought the choice was slightly limited and the room did get quite crowded but it was free, so can't complain.I would reccommend this place to anyone on a budget, looking to travel to San Francisco.I have also posted my trip report in the San Francisco Forum, if anyone is interested.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful We just spent a week staying at the Comfort Inn by the Bay in San Francisco. We had never been to San Francisco so was not sure where would be the best place to stay. I noticed on the web that Comfort Inn offered views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Bay plus reviews stated that it was within walking distance of many areas. That was our motivation for selecting Comfort Inn and we were extremely happy that we did! Our room was on the 7th floor and we definitely had a great view--got some wonderful pictures of the bridge  bay from our room. Our room was spacious and very nice. The breakfast buffet was definitely a plus! They have 3 waffle machines which prevents having to wait long to get a waffle. They also have bagels, boiled eggs, danish, cereal, juice, coffee (24 hrs/day), and muffins. It offers a nice variety without the problem of having to go somewhere else  pay for breakfast.It was about a 3 block walk to get to the bay area and then we were able to walk along the bay which was a very beautiful stroll to fisherman's wharf. There are shops all along the bay and many of them had cheaper prices than the stores located at Pier 39. We bought a Muni pass so were able to ride the Muni buses (a stop is located extremely close to Comfort Inn) as well as ride the Cable Cars as often as needed. Thoroughly enjoyed the conveniece of the Muni pass!One of the best sites to see is to do the Alcatraz tour. That was extremely informative and well done. The hotel is within walking distance of Lombard Street (the crooked street) but it is an uphill walk. We took the cable car which stops at the top of the street and then was able to walk down, take several pictures, and then walked back up to catch the cable car. We could have walked down a couple of blocks and caught the other Cable Car line. While there we also did several tours through Gray Line. They pick up at the hotel. We did the following tours: city, bay cruise, Muir Woods, Monterey  Carmel 17 mile, and Yosemite. We enjoyed being able to see more of the area through the tours. We did not have a car and did not need one.Completely enjoyed our vacation in San Francisco and would definitely stay at Comfort Inn by the Bay again.

<Content>good base Just back from a 3 night stay in the comfort inn by the bay.we found location satisfactory,good for wharf and pier 39.All MUNI transport close by.Good big breakfast bar lots of choices.Staff polite.Over all we found the hotel clean and good value for price,area good as we had two teenagers with us.Mels diner a few blocks down from hotel on Lombard,good burgers etc.N.B if staying for a few days buy the 3 day pass for muni on any tram or bus as it will pay for itself very quickly.

<Content>a great and convenient value When I had the opportunity to go to San Francisco last summer, I decided to stay where I had stayed 5 years earlier: at the Comfort Inn by the Bay. The hotel was great. My room had a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge. It was clean and nicely furnished. The hotel staff was very good in helping me negotiate my way around San Francisco on public transportation and in setting up a tour to Muir woods. They havd expanded their breakfast buffet and it was fantastic. I will stay there again. This is not a luxury hotel but is exactly what familites and older tourists are looking for.

<Content>Great Location, Clean, Updated Rooms, Good Value We stayed at the Comfort Inn by the Bay last week and were pleasantly surprised. We usually stay at higher-end hotels, but this time we just wanted a bed and bath since we'd be spending most of our time seeing the sights. We'll we couldn't believe what $130 a night got us at this prime location (AAA rate). The hotel is only blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and the less crowded, cable car turnaround. We were in easy walking distance to plenty of very nice restaurants and right across from famed Lombard Street. The hotel was recently remodeled and everything was clean, fresh and bright. Plus we had an outstanding view of the Golden Gate Bridge from our room. We would definitely stay here again. And parking was only $25 a night (which is cheap for SF).

<Content>Great start to holiday! Arrived at the hotel about 3pm and our room was ready. Met by friendly reception staff who gave us maps of the city. Room was up to standard though view from the window was of the building next door. You can upgrade if you want a better view of the city or the Golden Gate Bridge. Breakfast was as expected, cakes, muffins, cereal and a cool 'make it yourself ' waffle maker. There was always plenty to eat with as much tea and coffee as you wished. The hotel was in a great location for Fishermans Whalf which was a short walk down the hill. Here you can catch the cable car to Powell street and downtown. The hotel is also on the corner of Lombard street, where the ' most crooked street in the world' is just over the ( very steep ) hill. Room was kept clean. I was told about the charge for car parking on this web site, but i was not told about the charge for the room safe by the reception staff. As i checked out , i was told that i had to pay for this service. I complained and they dropped the charge. So be warned! Other than that we had a plesant stay and would use this hotel again.

<Content>Not bad To start off...i had my worries about booking with Comfort Inn but when i got there I was relieved. The location was great...walking distance to fisherman's wharf. The hotel room was nice. Even though we were on the second floor and had only a view of the other building, it was more than enough room. The rooms were clean and the maid service came everyday to clean. The staff was more then helpful in calling for tours to see if they squeeze you into a tour group or letting you know great places to eat. The breakfast was more than enough. You had choices of waffles, bagels. toast, english muffins, cerea,, hard boiled eggs, toast, and pastries. I thought that was more than enough for breakfast. The hotel staff were polite and wonderful and do anything to make your stay comfortable. As i said the location was great not to far from the Ghiradeli square or Fisherman's Wharf. If you go up Lombard Street, the most crooked road is right there. I enjoyed my stay here and would love to come back to it again.

<Content>Basic but comfortable The Comfort Inn by the Bay was a nice hotel. There was a mix up with our reservation when we arrived which took some time to sort out. Aside from that, the service was fine and the staff was helpful. Parking is terrible. It's a tiny lot attached to the hotel, so tiny that we actually scraped the car against a wall when trying to go down a ramp. It's also expensive at $28/day (which includes tax) but I suppose that's to be expected in San Francisco. The location was great, walking distance to the Wharf and Pier 39. Union Street is a cool little district a few blocks down that we enjoyed exploring as well. It's also close to several bus stops. The breakfast was good, there's basically cereal, waffles, and pastries. The rooms themselves were a little small, but not really cramped. Overall, I'd recommend it if the price is right, but will probably choose somewhere different for our next stay.

<Content>a decent place to stay I wanted somewhere handy for the bay for a 4 night stay. The inclusive continental breakfast was fine, bit monotonous after several days, but the waffle machine was fun ! The room and bathroom were great, even a view of the Golden Gate ! Didnt eat any other meals in the hotel, adequate cafes, bars  restaurants all within easy walking distance, as was Pier 39, ferries to Alcatraz and cable car trips.I paid 85 us dollars for a double room, 340 for 4 nights, which I thought was good value for what we received

<Content>Comfort Inn by the Bay We booked the Comfort Inn by the Bay via the BA.com website and got an excellent deal - BA recommend the hotel and it certainly was very good value - in fact the BA site had it cheaper than anywhere else at the time. Breakfast was basic but perfectly acceptable and we never found the dining room full despite eating at all sorts of different times. I enjoyed the freah-made do-it-yourself waffles. The staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable and nothing seems too much trouble. They've a range of takeaway menus if you decide to dine in but there are some excellent bars and restaurants not too far away to tempt you out. It's a pleasant walk down to Fisherman's Wharf and there is a range of buses that pass by the front door whether you're going up or down town. Our best purchase was a seven-day Muni passport - $24 each but covers transport on all buses, streetcars AND cable cars. With a one trip ride on a cable car being $5 it was a good buy indeed. We travelled round a lot and visited a lot of the 'micro-breweries' in SF - all of them were excellent in their own way and they all provided an excellent and different range of food - from tapas to full blown meals - well worth looking them out. Our best cocktails were upstairs at the Boudin bakery at Fisherman's Wharf - $5 for a large and well-prepared cocktail - Bo is a very friendly man behind the bar. For a snack in the sunshine there is an outside area downstairs at Boudin - serve yourself inside and take the food out. We had chowder and a salad or sandwich for just over $7 each - excekllent - the Californian Pinot Grigio was also excellent value at around $10 a bottle. We were generally impressed by the value in SF if you keep your eyes open, and generally everywhere is kept very clean - public toilets fresh and clean and well looked after. We had a steak at Bobo's on Lombard - just a stroll across the street from the hotel - and it was excellent. It's a small bar with dining areas and does get very busy. We recommend SF and the Comfort Inn by the Bay. We'd go back tomorrow.

<Content>decent The hotel was well-located, good value, breakfast was good. Room was a little small but definitely liveable. The onlt thing I can really complain about is the parking charge. Not only is it 28$ per day but it's not even guaranteed parking. So, if there is no space you have to bring your ticket back to the front desk and tell them not ot charge you, and make SURE they don't cuz they tried to charge me for 2 days in which I did not park in the hotel garage and then we had to argue about it. In the end they took the fees off. And here's a pointer - on the weekends the parking is free on the street so park on Friday night and leave your car there all weekend and avoid the charges! There's no reason to use your car in San Francisco anyway. SO, all in all, no major problems here, just a couple of pointers to save some bucks!

The hotel was very nice, the rooms were a good size and great value for money. Also the view from our room out over the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge was amazing. Only downside was the car parking charge of $25 a day. Otherwise this was a great hotel and would definitely recommend.

<Content>Mainly good, but could be better too We arrived at the airport in San Fran only to find that after placing a call to the hotel they didnt have a shuttle bus which frankly was a pain ! we had to either pay for a shuttle which doesnt come cheap, or take the bus. Being a bit cheap we decided to take the bus with others but lagging our luggage off and on the bus was no mean feat. We caught the bus down town and because the bus didnt run to Van Ness and Lombard (where the hotel is located) we had to take a taxi, still cheaper than that shuttle from the airport!so we checked in, and all seemed fine. We were given a room on the 10 floor but I was amazed every morning how noisy lombard St was !then I found some hair in the bathroom and the glasses on the sink were not cleaned the whole time we were there. Bed seemed clean and everything else was ok. A weird thing though was one night with the lights out I saw writing on the wall - it was creepy something out of CSI, since you couldnt see it in the day . Weird. The biggest annoyance was all these kids came in from a tour group pretty much the whole time we were there. And didnt they make a big noise. Two and three am they were running up and down the hall, and despite my placing calls to the front desk they didnt seem to care. The free breakfast was just ok, but nothing too nutrionally sound if you are into healthy eating its more pastries and so on. What really got up my nose when I checked out the guy at the front desk said we owed them 10 for the hotel safe in our room. He said it was on the check in slip, but I read that and nowhere did it say that you had to pay for that. So I said to him look thats really unfair, you should tell people that ! and I refused to pay. All in all it was just ok, and I dont know if I would stay here again. Good location to Lombard St, Ghiradelli chocolate factory and the fishermans wharf. But for the price I guess I got what I paid for. I think next time if I was in the same area I would stay at the Hyatt instead down the road.

<Content>great hotel in an expensive city This hotel is on the corner of Van Ness and Lombard. Its got great views to the bridge (we paid a little extra for this). The bus stop is right across the road and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance - we probably would have liked a little more choice in that regard.The rooms were well sized, and very comfy beds. We had the continental breakfast each morning which was really nice. I researched a lot of hotels on the net before choosing this one, and for $125 usd per night for a family of four. It was well ahead in the price stakes of any other hotel. The desk staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful with bus routes, where to wash, what to see etc etc....All in all, great choice in a great city..

<Content>Comfortable, sort of by the bay Having read a bad review of a place near Civic Center I have stayed in a couple of times before, I changed at last minute to Comfort Inn by the Bay based on reviews here. The recent reviews are quite accurate: this is a decent place to stay, somewhat convenient to Fisherman's Wharf, a little inconvenient for other locations.Room was small but fine; loud noise from rain falling on the air conditioner can be forgiven since that day was the heaviest rain on that date since 1838! Room faced a wall, so no view, but hardly ever in it during the day, so that was also no problem. Upgrades available for a fee. Wireless internet handy and free.Surprisingly, hard to find a late night snack on Lombard, but pretty good snacks in the snack machine on the third floor. Breakfast was quite good, especially the waffles. Was there pretty early every day so can't comment on them possibly running out of things.From one block north (Chestnut) there is the #30 bus through North Beach and Chinatown to downtown, takes about 20-25 minutes. To come to the hotel, cable car to Lombard, then walk downhill. To make the return trip that way would be a bit brutal since it is quite a hill. As usual, for a stay in the SF city area, a Muni Passport is a good idea, I don't think they have them at the desk though. This is especially true if staying at this hotel since only Fisherman's Wharf west area (Ghirardelli etc.) is really within walking distance.Staff, as mentioned in other reviews, was quite friendly and helpful and the area is better than many.

<Content>Clean,comfortable,friendly staff Let's get it straight from the start-this is not a luxury hotel.Having said that I would thoroughly recommend it having just returned from an enjoyable trip to San Francisco with my partner with the Comfort as our base.The hotel was clean,the beds were comfortable and the plumbing and TV worked. The hotel is fairly basic but we weren't there to spend our time hanging round there too much. We really only had dealings with the reception staff and they were helpful and friendly.The buffet breakfast is fairly basic but adequate with cereals,waffles,preserves,maple syrup,bagels,crumpets,cream cheese and fresh fruit.The hotel is well located for the San Francisco waterfront and the crooked section of Lombard Street is about a 10-15 minute walk.My partner and I don't mind walking but some people may want to get a taxi to get to some places such as Union Square, Coits Tower,Palace of Fine Art as they are a longer walk and SF has many hills.If you book any excursions these will usually pick you up direct from the hotel wherever you are staying. The Comfort was also located in a safe area. There are a lot of homeless people in SF but we never felt threatened.SF is a great city with plenty to see and do and great eating,drinking and shopping opportunities.

If your in a room with a vending machine outside, kiss a night sleep good bye. (Unless you pull the plug)

<Content>Good value for the money Just came back from a short visit to the city. This is an economy hotel so don't expect alot. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food available for the continental breakfast. As others have said, I agree, go early as it fills up quickly. There is no IHOP or Denny's in walking distance, so I would recomend taking the continental breakfast. The room was clean enough, and it was quiet enough for me, though I was not facing Lombard. Depending on your fitness level/mobility, it is within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf , Marina district, and Pacific Heights. The crooked section of Lombard is close too, but it is a climb to get there. The only down side is it is not near a BART station, so look into the MUNI bus schedule if not renting a car. Parking is very restrictive in some areas and ALL parking lots are very expensive, be warned! Enjoy your stay.

<Content>exceptional value! have just returned from a six night trip to san francisco.stayed at this hotel mainly based on price so i was'nt too sure what to expect.having got the shuttle from the airport , i was slightly worried when we pulled up outside...it really looks nothing at all from the outside in fact even a bit dreary.but as soon as i got in, well what a difference..nice lobby, and was greeted by the most kind and welcoming woman on the front desk i've ever met.she checked me in, asked how long i was staying and if i knew what i wanted to do whilst in san francisco.she then gave me maps of the area and helped with transport information.the hotel has bus stops right outside.fishermans wharf is only a 15 minute walk away.the room itself was only a single so fairly small but cosy.it was also spotless.the friendliness on the front desk continued all the time i was there.i spent ages talking to them.the other thing you need to know is that you get a free continental breakfast every morning....it is a superb spread.the only problem is that the breakfast room can get fairly crowded so you may want to go down either very early or leave it a while.all in all this was better than a lot of bigger chain hotels in which i've stayed and would be more than happy to visit again.

<Content>Overall good experience We spent three nights at this hotel in September 06. We felt that this hotel was value for money. It was well located to most of the main tourist attractions, and I would recommend walking around San Francisco as much as possible as opposed to taking buses, you get a great feel for the place. We walked down Columbus Street, with great Italian restaurants, to Union Square and back most days and it was great exercise!The rooms were spacious, although beds a little smaller than I have had in other hotels. The bathroom was averaged sized and well equipped. There was an ice machine on each floor, and speedy lifts. Our view was mainly of buildings, but we had not paid for a bay view so we didn't mind.Only real gripe was that a couple of the assistants on the front desk were not friendly, and one was extremely patronising, which I did not appreciate. However, we didn't let this spoil our stay in San Francisco. We definitely want to return, you could spend three weeks in this place. My favourite place on the west coast hands down. I would reccomend this place due to comfort, location and value for money.

<Content>Value for Money in Fisherman's Wharf We stayed at the Comfort Inn for 3 nights in August, and found it to be pleasant, clean and for the money(we only paid 拢69 per night for the room including breakfast), well located for visiting the sights of Fisherman's Wharf, and after a short bus ride, the famed department stores of Union Square.Our room had two Queen size double beds, aircon, ensuite, sufficient wardrobe and drawer space, TV and telephone, and an-in room safe payable for only if you used it, more than adequate for a family of 3. Our 5 year old son loved the idea of his own double bed! Only let down was no fridge, but there was an ice machine at the end of our corridor to keep any lagers bought at the nearby liqour store chilled long enough, and to add to my wife's vodka and coke!The room was very clean, and the maid changed our towels daily even if we had hung them back up, and made our beds daily also.Location wise we were about 10 minutes walk to fish restaurants near to Pier 39, and just 1 block down was a bus stop, from where we got the bus to Union Square during the day. It cost $1.50 each adult, and under 5's are free, so if your child is 5, then say he is not! The bus drivers didn't seem to mind!Two trips I would absolutely 100% recommend you make time for in your stay are a city tour on the 'big red shiny mack fire engine', which takes you around the city and over the Golden Gate Bridge, whilst dressed up as real firemen and women, on an open backed fire engine! Excellent! Only $40 adult, $25 child. Well worth it!The second trip is Alcatraz! Book through blue and gold fleet for about $17 adult,$10 child. Don't go to San Francisco and not go to Alcatraz. It would be such a waste! The sight of the prison and the history told on the audio tape will really make you think! Book both of these trips in advance as numbers are limited if you want to take the trips when you want to!Overall we enjoyed our short visit to San Francisco, despite our luggage being misplaced by the airline for most of our stay!, and for convenience and price, I would definitely recommend the Comfort Inn by the Bay.

<Content>Great Value- Outstanding View Clean and friendly hotel. My son and I were there for three days and had a great stay. Get a room with a view of the Golden Gate; it's the best value in town. It was outstanding to eat our complimentary breakfast with this fantastic view. I called the hotel directly and they gave me a better rate than online booking services. The garage is small and some people were complaining about not having a space available in which to park- but we were lucky. The staff checked our luggage for us in the office so we could spend most of our check-out day sightseeing. They also booked us a cab to Oakland airport- shuttle is not complimentary from hotel. The hotel is a short walk to Fisherman's Wharf and transportation stops- the staff was most helpful in giving us maps and directions. All in all, it was a great stay and recommended to anyone in the area.

<Content>A Good Vacation At The Inn By the Bay (06/19/06-06/24/06) I spent five nights at The Comfort Inn By The Bay, My room was on the City side and it was as pictured on the website, Room was adequate but on the small side, TV, AC, iron, no refrigerator.I will probably book the view rooms on my next visit. A good breakfast was provided . Most positive: The staff as they were professionals with a friendly attitude. I actually misplaced my wallet with hundreds in travellers checks when I checked out. The checks were returned to American Expressand my wallet was mailed to my Kailua ,Hawaii home. Most Negative: Please tell the manager to purchase better and more comfortable pillows. All in all I really enjoyed my trip as as my wife Diane and I explored San Francisco, biked the Golden Gate Bridge all the way to Sausalito and then to Tiburon. (Blazing Saddles Bike Rentals), Fishermen's Wharf, enjoyed the play Spelling Bee at the Post Street Theater, shopping as my wife enjoys this activity, very good restaurants nearby includingAntica Trattoria(Italian),Slanted Door at the Ferry Building, and the Boudin Sourdough Bakery and Cafe at Fishermen's Wharf. We also enjoyed the Alcatraz tour and several attractions which was included in the City Pass. The City pass also allowed you to ride the Muni and Trolley cars. We rented our rental car at Budget also on Van Ness Ave after we checked out and drove to Lake Tahoe and then to Reno. I would certainly recommend Comfort Inn By the Bay and I would return to this hotel on my next visit.. The hotel was conveniently located and it was in a quiet and reputable neighborhood (Russian Hiill) along the bus routes. (By the way I did have may main cash and credit card wallet with me as I carry two wallets).(Clifford-Kailua Hawaii)

<Content>Nice Place Nice hotel at the corner of Lombard and Van Ness (US 101). You can walk down to all of the attractions along the bay in about 20 minutes. Walk down Van Ness and take a right on Bay and then a left on one of the cross streets down to the bay to avoid the hills. You are also close to the crooked part of Lombard Street. Now, this is an uphill walk. Room was small, but very nice. High Speed Internet worked very well. Upper level odd numbered rooms have a view of San Francisco Bay and cost extra for the view. Even numbered upper level rooms have a good view as well. Lower level rooms may have road noise as Lombard and Van Ness is a major intersection. Breakfast was good and I went early to avoid the wait for seats that happened later on in the breakfast hours. There are a lot of restaurants in the immediate area as well as the ones down by the bay. The only thing that kept me from rating this hotel 5 stars was the parking garage. It is very tight down there. Be careful! Even though it says two way traffic, I don't know how two cars could pass each other. Also, the total cost for parking is about $35 a night when you factor in the city parking tax. I didn't move my car while I was there, but since everything is within walking distance or a short ride on public transit, it didn't affect me that much. Overall, a good stay. I'd stay at this Comfort Inn again.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed at the Comfort Inn by the Bay for 5 nights. The hotel was clean, well organised with friendly staff and the rooms were good value. Breakfast is included and is a help yourself buffet with the basics such as muffins, waffles  various breads. The Breakfast room can be very busy though hence you may have to wait for a table. We had 2 different rooms (a Queen size for 3 nights and a King size with 2 double beds for 2 nights which also looked out at the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge) due to availability whern we booked. The latter room was only slightly more expensive but almost twice the size and had the fantastic Bay view so I would certainly ask for this if visiting again. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant/bar or gym/pool so be prepared to find these if required. The Voodoo Lounge across the road is worth a visit as it is small and friendly bar, and open to late. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel as it does everything well, however you may want to check out the hotels actually in Fishermans Wharf as this is a 15/20 minute walk from there, which seems longer by the end of a nightout.

<Content>Will definitely stay again. Very clean, super nice people, located on one of the main streets in SF. You can walk to the fisherman's warth in 15 minutes which saves time and money on parking. They were repainting the outside while we were there, but that didn't bother me because they really make an effort to have a really clean, nice motel for you to stay in. For the SF bay area, it is priced very good for the quality. I will definitely stay here again. The also offer $25 parking in their garage and I highly recommend this extra cost.Bathrooms were tiny, but functional.Hair dryer, iron, remote TV, nice powerful AC, but no frig which kind of disappointed me since we like to shop for drinks at a local store and keep them cool so we don't have to purchase out of the machines or on the piers.Tredd from SW PA.

<Content>Excellent value for money Stayed here for 3 nights from 19th to the 22nd May, and it was a very good hotel to start our holiday. We did think about prebookingLorries shuttl;e bus but I'm glad I ddin't! The airport is huge and we were trying to figure out where to go to pick it up, but there wasn't one available, so we got on another shuttle bus. It cost us $16 per person plus tip on top, but because it's a shuttle expect to stop around the airport until the shuttle is full. Then expect to make multiple stops at other hotels, we were the second to last people to get off. We decided to use a taxi on the return journey! I was speaking to someone who took a taxi instead and they said they were taken around to see the tourist sights without asking! Which meant they had to pay about $56 in the end, so it's up to you what you want to do. So when we needed a ride back to the airport on the Monday, we asked the front desk to book us a taxi, they go with a reputable company that takes straight to the airport, as there are some taxi companies that take you the long way back so that it costs more! So our taxi cost $50 including tip but at least it was direct! Worth the extra 10 bucks instead of the shuttle.Location was quiet and just a few blocks from Fishermans Wharf, not quite walking distance but you can get the no 47 Bus from across the road and you'll be there within 10 Min.Hotel room was spacious and clean, view wasn't great but you can pay for a room with a view of the Golden gate but we didn't take up the offer. The front desk staff were very friendly and helped our stay to be enjoyable, helping us with which bus to get for the Wharf and also to get to the Union square area! There was also free Tea and Coffee in the dining room area which was fully appreciated!Only one thing stopped me putting down execellent and that is the maid. We went out first thing in the morning and didn't return till about 2pm and the room wasn't done. We thought okay, we came back a bit soon so the following day we came back about 4pm and she was just doing it then! My wife asked her how long will she be and the maid was a bit short with her response. We were on the 4th floor so if you happen to be on that floor and the maid hasn't tidied your room, complain to the front desk. We didn't as it was our last full day.I think the hotel is used alot by French and German tourists, so I guess that's why it was mostly a Continental breakfast, but you can make your own waffles and toast if you want to.Overall I would stay there again as you get everything you could wish for the money you've paid plus very friendly front desk staff. As for the city itself, San Francisco is a lovely place. If you want to go to Alcatraz, definitely book it up in advance, there is a standby line, but there's no guarantee you'll get on!Restaurants and shopping was relatively cheap and of good quality. Every kind of shop you can think of can be found, especially around the main area of Union square. Any questions then I'll be happy to help. Just drop me an email and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, Great Location, Great Staff I stayed in this hotel for a week. It was an absolute bargain. Fantastic location. Just around the corner from lombard street and only a five minute walk if that to fishermans wharf. The rooms were really spacios and clean. You get a free continental breakfast which is superb. The staff in the hotel are really friendly and helpful especially if you want to check out of your room later than is requested. I highly recommend this hotel. Its a great base for exploring san francisco.

<Content>Excellent Hotel My daughter and I stayed in this hotel in April 2006. As we were travelling alone, safety was very important to us and we found the hotel to be in a very good, central location. The reception staff were very helpful with tourist information and buses etc. We had a double room and unlike most other US hotels we had stayed in, the room only had 1 queen size bed and the room was quite small. It was perfectly adequate though for the short amount of time we actually spent in the room and it was very clean. The free breakfast in the morning is good. The hotel is located about a 10 min walk away from the beginning of Fisherman's Wharf which is a great place to go both during the day time and early evening with street performers and artists. BUT beware of the Bush man!!!! We really enjoyed our stay in San Francisco and would definitely go back there and the hotel.

<Content>Great stop over It is a fair way from the International Airport, but the shuttle bus dropped us off right at the door. Rooms were a good size, though we booked for a double room and got what looked like two large single beds to sleep in. Hotel has high speed internet access in the rooms if you carry your laptop with you. Very close to Fishermans Wharfe and not too far from down town. Not a lot of places to eat at near by (well cheap ones anyway). But overall we found this to be a very comfortable place, breakfast was plenty to get you started for the day.

<Content>Nice, affordable and comfortable, convenient. Stayed at the hotel from 9th to 12th. Lovely hotel very close to the wharf and Pier 39, about a 15 min walk from the hotel and there is a bus which takes you straight down there. First room we were allocated was near the Pepsi machine which sounded as if it was going to blow up. The gentleman who served us on front desk was extremely nice and provided a new room on the 7th floor.He also provided a map of the area and pointed out the different bus routes. Very good service for novices in this city. Alcatraz a must as it visiting the seals that hang around Pier 39.Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was small but had all the basic amenities. Only drawback is the guest services booklet states the hotel has a laundry service that you can use with coin operated machines. Turns out the laundry is not on the property but is 2 blocks away.Continental breakfast was average, toast, shelled boiled eggs and some cereal. Nothing fancy but average.We didn't hire a car in SF so no need to use the parking facilities. Lift's were a little slow and it appeared as if only one lift worked at a time. Overall nice stay, clean, cheap and very close to the bay.

<Content>Great Stay! Our family of four loved the hotel. The location was great, central to the things we wanted to see, and located on 101 and several transit lines. We used the convenient, safe, and well-lit parking garage to park our car and leave it for two days while we walked and took transit. We stayed at five hotels on this trip and this was the best of them. The room was attractive and well-maintained. Our view of the Golden Gate Bridge was gorgeous. The wireless high-speed internet service worked perfectly from the start. This is the first hotel I've stayed at in years that had a separate thermostat, so the room heater shut itself off when it reached your temperature; no heater running all night! The continental breakfast was also the best of the trip. The hotel served a wide selection of fruit and baked goods. They even served shelled boiled eggs!

We used the Breakfast facilities every morning. A full English breakfast would have been nice but hey, when in Rome do as the Roman's do!Surrounding views of the Golden Gate Bridge was great and bus and Taxi services just outside the door.Found the Staff polite and friendly. Would recommend this Hotel to family and friends.

<Content>OK rooms Rooms were average, small bathrooms. Lights were energy efficient, but not in a good way. When lights were turned on they were very dim, they would warm up after 5 minutes (making sizzling noises the entire time) and then be a normal brightness. Parking was very tight in the garage and they say parking is $25 but they also charge a $3.50 parking 鈥渢ax鈥?upon check out. Room was nice, beds were lumpy and pillows were rock hard. We paid for a bay view, and that was very nice; had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge!! Free breakfast doesn't start until 6:30 am so if you have an early flight, forget about breakfast. Overall, hotel average, nothing to write home about.

<Author>WeLoveSanFrancisco
<Content>Thanks for the Memory! My husband and I live in Orange County Calif and have enjoyed vacationing in San Francisco, as we try and get away to this beautiful city as often as possible. We make it a habit of staying in different hotels in different areas of the city, to experience the diversified areas. For the rating and price, this hotel is a real gem! Staying here on our last vacation was a real find, and I would not object to staying here again. We were here December 18th - 22nd 2005, right before Christmas. And although most of the entire days were overcast and raining, we still enjoyed ourselves.The staff, and management at this hotel was very kind and professional, and made our stay that much more pleasant. The continental free breakfast (although they stop serving at 9:30 in the morning) wasn't bad at all. I didn't see the waffles as the ads suggest, but it still was pretty ample quanties, and much better than the usual coffee and simple pastries that other hotels' offer. Because we like to sleep in late; I was usually down before 9:30 to bring a tray of goodies for my husband and I back up to the room, and the wait/kitchen staff was gracious about this.We didn't pay for a room with a view of the Bay/Golden Gate Bridge, but it actually worked out fine. As with the rainy weather, low clouds, and fog rolling in and out our view would have probably been obscured. We stayed on the 6th floor and our view wasn't that bad. Our room was kept up very clean, and the maid service respectful of our late sleeping hours.Comfort Inn by the Bay is a good hotel and adjacent to Fisherman's Wharf - nice! When we can, we will return to San Francisco, and I hope we have the opportunity to stay in this wonderful hotel again.Thank you staff and management!

This hotel was much better then I expected, easy to find, parking was no problem and we were checked in within minutes.Room did not have a Golden Gate View, but they have it down to a tea that you can have an upgrade, at a price. There are posters everywhere.Breakfast was ideal, I was very suprised how large the selection was. We had no problem with getting seated and the staff cleared the tables efficiently.Its a pretty 10 minute walk to the Cable Car turn around, or 15 to Fishermans wharf, taxis were dirt cheap so we used them a lot.I would recommend this hotel, much nicer to stay out of Union sq.

<Content>Look for something else This hotel is fair at best. It is definitely a budget hotel. I had to ask at least 4 individuals before someone could guarantee that my boarding pass could be printed. One of the front desk individuals referred to one of the evening staff as difficult in that she wasn't sure he would print our boarding pass. The breakfast attendant was nasty and wouldn't allow us to take anything before 6:30 (even though we were running out to catch a plane). The coffee was horrible and the continental breakfast wasn't that good. Our 5:00 a.m. wake up call never came through. The bathrooms are so small in this hotel and the view that we paid extra for was obstructed by very dirty windows. On a positive note, the rooms were clean and the night auditor, Tove, was pleasant and did come through with printing my boarding pass. I think the staff at this hotel needs to attend Hampton Inn's customer service training. The hotel is close to Fisherman's Wharf if you like to walk but not close if you don't like to walk. Take the bus.We had a great time in San Francisco despite our disappointment with the Comfort Inn. Take the three hour Jeep Tour of SF (about $59, ask for Paul) and look into the City Walks Tours (free). We took a City Walk Tour of the Haight Ashbury area that was fantanstic (lead by Joe Lord). Also, we loved the Nappa Valley area - don't miss it.

It took about 8-10 min. to walk to Fishermanns Wharf area, which was perfect. Also continental breakfast buffet is incl. at the hotel, really good deal compared to the price and the location.

<Content>Enjoyable stay at the Comfort Inn by the Bay I stayed at the Comfort Inn by the Bay from August 29th through the 5th of September and overall, it was an enjoyable experience. Our room was large, clean and comfortable (beside the mattresses which were not hard enough!). We also did get the view of the bay as promised (we stayed on the 5th floor). However, contrary to what some other reviews I have read said, the walls are not paper thin (unless you stand right next to them). You do hear the ongoing traffic outside though, but it's not too disturbing (and I am a light sleeper). Do not, and I repeat do not, use the phone to call long distance, otherwise, you'll be very sorry (17$ for a 5 min call)...As far as their free breakfast goes, it was ok...there was enough food (the cutlery was not plastic for those for whom it matters) and tables (we only had to eat in our room once and it was the labor day sunday). As far as location goes, the hotel is in a safe neighborhood and closeby to North Beach (take the 45 bus to get on the other side of the hill, trust me), Chinatown (walk down Van Ness to Broadway, make a left and go through the tunnel) and Fisherman's wharf. Moreover, the crookedest part of Lombard is on the other side of the hill from the hotel and Union Square is a bus ride away (Bus #30 on the corner of Chesnut and Van Ness). I would stay at this hotel again

<Content>Good Value, Good Location, Mid Market Hotel Just got back and felt this was a very good hotel for the money. Very clean and staff was helpful. We reserved a bay view room for $149 (floors 9-11) but unfortenatly the FOG blocked most of the views... the hotel is about 10 blocks from the bay so we could see the houses and businesses all the time!We arrived way early (930 am) and our room was ready so we got to check in! Breakfast was ok.. cereal, boiled eggs, fruit, juices, bagels... nothing super.. but plenty.We flew into SFO and took BART ($4.95) to Powell station, then bought a 3 day UNI bus/trolley car pass for $15.. took Powell-Hyde trolley (we packed light) to Lombard street and walked 3 blocks down to hotel. It is true, busses nearby.. I was a bit nervous about finding my way around but the front desk staff extremely friendly and had a map of a few major routes... found out 1 block away bus 30 goes by fishermans warf area, then china town, then financial district, then by Powell station. It comes about every 7 minutes! So we rode 30 about 20 times. So excellent location for using public transit.. and staff is helpful.Only compliant is that the windows are not mirrored at all... so close the drapes for privacy... we discovered this later in the day when we went out for a walk.. a little too late.Again, we would stay in a heartbeat again here... very clean and in good shape.. they also use newer keys than the old magentic cards. They even held our bags the last day all day long for no charge!

<Content>Yep - great view included! Wow - great hotel right on 101 (corner of Van Ness and Lombard). We reserved a deluxe - panoramic bay view room and it turned out just like the room reviewed here with pictures! $20+ parking per night included in and out privileges but, trust me, the parking is so tight (and virtually every spot is occupied daily!) you won't want to go in and out! (Also, spend the extra time and back in to your parking spot - you'll be thankfull you did when it's time to leave!)The free continental breakfast was really busy but kept fairly well stocked - nothing special.This location is great - very easy to walk to the wharf area - and all public transportation is close by. We really enjoyed our stay!Booking was via Expedia: 2 queen beds / 4 adults / $150+ = 204.78 total/night.

<Content>Great View and Good Location We went there as a family of five including an 18 year old and twin 16 year olds. We had originally booked one room - two queen beds and a rollaway but found it too small for our requirements. They immediately offered us another room - albeit on a different floor - but it was way after midnight and we were glad for the extra space.The next day they offered us another room next door to our bay view room. They couldn't be more accomodating really. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The bathroom was a bit small. Breakfast was very welcoming - great not to have to traipse out for something to eat. The bay view was great to chill and look out on to although you may not see the top of the bridge because of the fog. Also take a sweater with you as it can get a bit chilly in the breeze.We found it very easy to get about and we all enjoyed being without a car for a change. The trams and buses are great. We found San Franciscans to be very friendly and as Brits we couldn't have been treated better.I had a cup of tea at the Italian cafe across the road one morning whilst everyone breakfasted. AS they seem to cook in the centre of the cafe they do seem to have a problem with cooking smells. Also it was a bit run down.We enjoyed eating and drinking in North Beach, liked traipsing around Chinatown, my son loved the record story in Haight Ashbury but one of my daughters was a bit unnerved by some of the weird and wonderful characters there. Alcatraz was absolutely fascinating - just a short boat ride so don't bother to buy food and drink on board as it very pricey!All in all we loved San Francisco!

<Content>Decent but not overwhelming The Comfort Inn by the Bay is a competent Motor Hotel that is about what you would expect for its price range. The rates are fairly decent for the City and the hotel is good value. Probably the best thing about this hotel is the location. Located at the foot of Russian Hill near Cow Hollow, the Marina and, yes, Fisherman's Wharf, it's a wonderful location. It's also convenient along the bus lines to the rest of San Francisco; and along the 101 to Marin and points beyond (Napa, etc.). For this property, the rooms are fairly spartan with budget priced amenties. Sheets and towels lack softness but otherwise serviceable. The continental breakfast is fine if you like those kind of buffets. Unfortunately, these offerings often seem to be overrun with people trying to eat their room rate worth in breakfast. And unfortunately, this one is no different. There are plenty of good places to have breakfast nearby (walk up to the Crepe House on Polk). Parking is $20 so budget that into your trip (or better yet leave the car at home).The net is if you are looking for a reasonably priced place to stay in a great neighborhood, you could do worse than the Comfort Inn by the Bay.

<Content>Nice place, shame they double charged the tax Nice Hotel and good location. Car parking charged for at $20 per night plus tax. That's where the mistake was made! We stayed three nights and paid our $60 plus $8.40 tax. We asked for the bill to be split between two visa cards. This was done but on later checking we found that each card was charged $30 plus $8.40 tax. So double charge for tax. I wonder if the tax man knows!Be warned and check your bill more carefully than we did. The hotel refuse to reply to my queries about this double charge so maybe they don't care as much as they should. It isn't the money it's the principle of good customer relations that matters. Had they replied and said sorry they could then have kept the money as a tip!

<Content>Good value It's not a luxury place, but for San Francisco, this hotel is a pretty good deal.Rooms are basic but clean, and not too small, either. Everything (bathroom fixtures, TV, etc.) seemed to be well taken care of. There's a good breakfast buffet in the mornings, too.The neighborhood is safe and quite busy, without being touristy. Of course, you can walk to the Chestnut St shopping area, or catch a bus or cab easily.

<Content>An absolute must to consider-I loved it! We just got back from our trip to San Francisco and we stayed at the Comfort Inn By The Bay based on the reviews from this site. We had a wonderful stay and we have no regrets staying here. We had a two queen bedroom and a crib (which turned out to be a playpen) with a tv, phone, wireless internet, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, coffee in the room, a great breakfast downstairs everymorning and a great view of the bay and bridge-all for a low price. The staff were really nice. For example, my son was not use to sleeping in the playpen because of the thin mattress that it comes with. So for the second night, the staff gave us extra blankets to use as extra cushioning (they didn't have extra mattresses so they said to try the blankets) and my son (only 11 months old) slept through the night! We're from Canada and this was our first trip to San Francisco, so paying a little extra for the view was well worth it. Someone mentioned in their review that the lights for the bathroom were on a timed dimmer and that was really nice on the eyes for those emergencies in the night-I didn't realize how true that was until I stayed there! There is also a pop machine on every floor and an ice machine by the way. And there was a safe in our room for a 1.25 extra per night. Breakfast was great-bread, mini muffins, english muffins, bagels, three different kinds of cereal, fruit and drinks. My sister really loved the fact that hot coffee (with stryofoam cups and lids!) were available throughout the day in the dining room as well. Perfect location-within walking distance within the warf, even chinatown if you are a little ambitious. One complaint, the bay side view rooms are a bit loud with the street traffic during the night, but that only woke me up once. As of for parking, we walked and bussed. People who do their research or know the city know that there is not much parking in San Francisco in general and driving can be zoo like. I can't emphasis enough how much you get for the price you pay. No it's not the The Ritz, it's the Comfort Inn and that's ok. So if you like a big bang for your buck, this is definately the place to be.

<Content>Very pleased I was very pleased with my stay. The rooms were not luxury rooms but they were clean and the beds slept good. We paid a little extra for a view that couldn't be beat. THe location was cental to just about anything you would want to do. being located on a main street the buses were accessable across the street. We also got a nice continental breakfast. When I go back I would love to stay here again.

<Content>10/10 or am i easily pleased!? We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of May and would'nt hesitate to go back. The rooms are big and clean, the bed was really comfortable - so much so that it was an effort to get out of. The staff were always pleasant and very helpful. The buffet breakfast was a lot better than expected after reading differing reviews on this site about it. We fell for the upgrade but regretted it. When you think, you only look out of your window the first day of your stay, after that thats all it is...a window....so we paid 拢拢拢拢's extra for a quick look at the Golden Gate Bridge! Unless it's your intent to sit for hours on end staring at the bridge from your window i'd say stick to your first choice if its a city view room and save your money for sight-seing. The lifts were not a problem as some ppl have said, we never had any long waits for them, the location is perfect for Fishermans Walk and the trams to Union Square etc. All in all a lovely stay in an equally lovely city.

<Content>Decent hotel We stayed for 4 nights in March. We found the hotel location to be very good, about 15 mins walk to Pier 39 area, but along the flatter route around the bay. It is close to the windy part of Lombard St also. We had a small mix up in the booking - we had requested a 2 queen room from an internet travel agent (which was not guarenteed) and when we arrived we found that we had a one bed king booking. We had to take this for one night but the hotel staff were able to swap to the 2 bed room for the other 3. The room was quite small but ok really, clean enough and quite quiet. Breakfast was ok, fairly decent selection of food but busy and used plastic cutlery. Rates were reasonable and would consider it again.

<Content>Generally great hotel in a nice location. I stayed at this hotel from March 30th to April 5th 2005. It is very good overall and is excellent value for money. The location is excellent; about three (very steep) blocks from the cable cars, about a 10 minute walk from Fisherman's Wharf and there is a bus stop one block down the road.The staff are very helpful, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. I have to agree with others that a fan in the bathroom would be helpful. Fortunately, I was very lucky with parking for the two nights I had a car - I managed to find a space, but it is very tight down there and there can't be more than about 30 spaces (bad for a hotel 138 rooms). Also, you may find yourself waiting about 3 minutes for one of the two lifts to go up a few floors, which can become very tedious after 6 nights.The breakfast was good, not the best, but it was free so I'm not complaining! The plastic cutlery is just a joke and the breakfast room can get very busy around about 8am, but there was still a solid selection of tasty food (toast, muffins, bagels, cereal, coffee, juice etc)I would recommend the Comfort Inn By The Bay to anyone staying in San Francisco. It isn't luxury, but it isn't budget either. The staff are as friendly as efficient as in any other good hotel, and it is a comfortable and convenient base from which to explore the city.

<Content>Hotel Good...Parking Poor We stayed here 3/23-24/05. The room was clean, beds very comfortable, blow dryers poor, fans needed in bathrooms, great view (10th fl.), location excellent. Would definantly book again. Parking opportunities are few. The garage does not have space for amount of rooms in hotel ($20 nightly fee), therefore if you do luck into a space, you may lose it when venturing out in the evening. Most sites are within walking distance. We inquired as to what program we should follow should we return with no space  were told we would then have to find spot on street (yea that's real easy) and of course they would not add the parking fee to that night. Overall we enjoyed staying here. Plan eating breakfast somewhere else though...they didn't even have danishes or mini muffins, just bagels, toast, english muffins. And may I recommend for a quick sandwich...go to the Viking Sub Shop across the street. EXCELLENT SUBS! Forget the Italian restaurant next to it (I believe it is called the Lombard Cafe or Inn). Smell will take your appetite away. This was recommended by the staff...but believe me, you could only eat here if you had a real bad cold! Also you must stop by the Crepe stand on the Pier 39 (around shops) on 1st level...to die for...recommend the Jammin.

<Content>Horrible and not recommended I arrived at the hotel with the hope of a great trip to San Francisco, however, I was quite disappointed. There were so many things wrong with the room that I questioned how much I was willing to spend for a stay at this establishment. Some of the things that were wrong were: the bathroom door lock did not lock, the bathroom did not have a fan so when someone would take a shower the mirror stayed fogged for a while, the furniture was chipped, and the size of the television resembled the size of my computer monitor. I have been quite pleased with the other comfort inn's that I have stayed at so I chose to stay at the other comfort inn in san francisco. At least that hotel was recently remodeled and the staff was friendly.

<Content>AMAZING! This hotel is incredible! The exterior of the hotel looks like what you'd expect from a Comfort Inn, but that's where it ends. The lobby is immaculate, the staff is smiling and friendly and always quick to offer service. The furnishings appear new both in the lobby, the hallways, and the guestrooms.The hotel itself is located on a busy street which makes public transportation very convenient. Multiple bus lines stop within a block of the hotel and connections to other buses, streetcars, cablecars, and trains is simple. If you're a cab-taker, don't call ahead. Just step out the door and wave one down (it's much faster that way). Fisherman's Wharf is within easy walking distance. Lombard Street (world's crookedest street) is only four blocks away, but it's uphill all the way and the climb would challenge a mountain goat. Best of all, the hotel is off the touristy path. The surrounding area is almost entirely residential, so it's clean, safe, and quiet (and slightly less expensive than the touristy areas).I was really amazed by the size of the and comfort of the guestrooms. Even my room with one double-sized bed had two chairs and a table with room to spare. Plenty of dresser space and lots of hangars, too. Unless you opened the windows, you'd never know you were in the city - it was very quiet. The only noise I ever heard from the hallway was when people were talking directly in front of my door. I was steps away from the soda/ice machines and never even heard them. I didn't have a view of the bay, but it wasn't that important to me. From what I understand, it's worth paying for if you're into that kind of thing. The bed was comfortable. Housekeeping is very attentive - I couldn't find anything they missed. The bathrooms have a really cool light fixture: when you flip the switch, the light goes from dim to bright gradually and automatically. Very helpful to avoid blinding yourself when you have to make a midnight run. They have a curved shower curtain bar which makes the shower feel bigger and keeps you from rubbing up against the curtain while you're showering.There are only 11 floors and they have two elevators. Both are quick, clean, and spacious. You have to pass the front desk to get to the elevators, but they don't check to see if you're a guest. Anyone can walk in off the street and access guest floors, so follow standard safety precautions. They do have a security guard who works overnight in addition to the regular staff. I regularly took public transportation and walked the streets around the hotel at all hours of the night. The neighborhood seems very safe and well lit. I can say with certainty that this guy has the easiest job in town. It's nice that he's there, but he certainly doesn't have much to keep him busy, except maybe the newspaper.Somehow, this place only has 2 stars. Amazing! You'd be foolish to spend more money for the same facilities and services at another hotel. I'll definitely stay here again on my next trip to San Francisco!

<Content>We were thrilled! We stayed here for 3 nights in January and were thrilled with the choice. The location of the hotel was excellent, close to public transport to downtown and a 10 min walk to Fishermans wharf and the cable and street cars. We had three people in our group and all were very comfortable. There was no problem with noise or anything else, the heating/cooling was efficient, the staff very helpful, the breakfast was substantial, the only thing that could have improved was having a fridge in the room but as the ice machine was only down the hall this wasn't a problem. Our suggestion to get a great rate is to shop around on the web and check trip advisor often for the reviews. We would certainly stay here again and recommend it to both friends and family!

<Content>What a wonderful, wonderful Guy! I'm a travel agent in the UK - I have 2 clients who chose the Comfort Inn by the Bay for part of their round-the-world honeymoon trip based on the reviews on this site and some reserach I did for them. Their relatives thought it would be nice to get them a bottle of champagne for Christmas Day - The sales manager of the hotel , Mr. Cruz, has spent his own time buying champagne and arranging for it to be in place for the guests to make their Christmas extra special. I have tried similar requests with 5 star plus properties (who shall remain nameless) only to be told that it's not possible for me to do. To get a level of dedication and service like this is exceptional and if it's indicative of the rest of the hotel this must be one amazing place.

<Content>Good value  Stayed here 3 nights during our first trip to San Francisco Sept 2004 and were happy with our choice. Not luxurious, but a well kept hotel with friendly, helpful staff. Good value (reasonable breakfast included). Reasonable location - 15 mins easy walk/$6 taxi to Fishermans Wharf. Probably worth the extra for a bay/bridge view room.Friendly bar across Lombard St, but don't bother with the Italian restaurant. - better to walk to the Cannery area/Fishermans Wharf.

<Content>Comfort Inn - a tourist class hotel Read the negative review on the Comfort Inn and thought it was really unfair. I stayed here for a week last October and found it to be very satisfactory. This is a middle class tourist grade hotel. The rooms are well looked after, the staff is nice and there is a buffet breakfast provided each morning in the dining area for free with your room reservation. This hotel is not a high level, full service hotel and that is why the room rates are so reasonable. If someone wanted full service, bags carried, etc. they should go to a higher grade hotel. It would be like going to a hostel and expecting room service. I found the location wonderful, five blocks to Ghierdelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf, within one block of bus lines to downtown, Chinatown and the wharf area if you wanted to ride. The only thing that's a problem is the parking. It can be arranged for free with your room package, but the physical area of underground parking is very small, turns are close and it is not designed for large vehicles. We didn't have any problems, but vans, etc. did. This is basically a good hotel and I would recommend it to anyone who is not looking for the add-ons that are available in a more luxurious hotel. I found it a good value for my money in a city famous for its high hotel/housing rates - even better off season.

<Content>Horrible, horrible service! We booked a suite since we were travelling with 2 children and needed more running space. The first problem was when I inquired about getting a refrigerator for the room. (Note: All of the standard rooms have refrigerators, suites do not. What the...?!?) We needed it for medication for my daughter and milk for my son (an infant). They were unable to accomodate. Having been an insulin-dependant person for much of my adult life, I have NEVER had a problem getting a mini-fridge in any hotel room I have ever stayed in.The second nail in the coffin was when we tried to go to sleep the first night - there were only 2 pillows provided on the king bed (where there should be 3) and none for the queen sleeper. I called down and was told that I would have to come to the front desk to get the pillows. (Why should I, the guest, have to come retrieve something they forgot?) I get to the front desk and spoke with someone else than who I phoned and he was incredulous that I had never heard of the fact that extra pillows are kept in the drawers in the room. (I stay at hotels EXTREMEMLY often and have NEVER seen this - extra pillows are always provided on the shelf in the closet.) I went back upstairs from the front desk (without pillows) to check my room. There was one extra pillow. I needed a minimum of two. I called back down. Sorry, you'll have to come down to get your extra pillow. I was ticked off. I was JUST DOWN THERE! I told them to send it up and they continued to get cattier and cattier about the fact that they would not send it up. I hung up on them.To make a long story longer, there is NO SERVICE at this establishment. If something major came up at night, what would you do? The staff was unhelpful (and downright rude) and the customer is NEVER right here. AVOID!

<Content>Nice stay in San Francisco We stayed at Comfort Inn by the Bay for a couple nights in late July 2004. The room was very nice, on the top floor with a great view of the city and the Golden Gate bridge. The location is a strong point, within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf and the cable car lines. The only problem is the parking situation. The garage is small for the hotel size, individual parking spaces are small as well, and there's a $20 per day parking fee. If you're picking up or returning a rental car in SF, think about whether you really need to have it during your stay here - it may not be worth the expense and hassle.

<Content>Great location! My husband and I spent two nights at the Comfort Inn By The Bay on July 12 and 13, 2004. A friend from work recommended it to me and after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor we decided to give it a try. We were very pleased with this hotel! We had a double queen bed room on the 6th floor with a great view of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. The room was immaculately clean, the hotel was very well kept up and the hotel service was wonderful. You do not need a car because it is a very easy five minute walk down to Fisherman's Wharf and just a couple blocks from the cable cars. Buses can pick you up right outside the hotel on Van Ness. The only negative thing about staying here is that on the bay view side of the hotel there is a little street noise from the busy intersection on Lombard and Van Ness. It wasn't enough to interfere with our sleep and when the air conditioning was running you couldn't hear the noise at all. It would not stop us from staying here again and the view of the bay was worth being on that side of the hotel. The breakfast was good and there was always plenty of food. This hotel does not have swimming pools, gyms, etc., but we didn't need those things...we were here to see San Francisco! If you just want a clean, safe feeling area to stay in while you tour the city this is it. We would have no problems staying here again.

<Content>Great experience at Comfort Inn by the Bay! My boyfriend and I spent 4 nights at the Comfort Inn by the Bay over Memorial Day weekend (May 29-June 2, 2004) and we were thrilled with our experience! I was slightly nervous before our arrival, since I had booked the hotel sight unseen. Luckily I had nothing to worry about! The hotel seems newly renovated and is clean and comfortable. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location - it's so close to lots of different sightseeing areas. Don't stay here if you want a lot of frills; but if you want a clean, cozy room and a hot shower every morning before you start sightseeing...this is the perfect spot!The hotel staff was courteous and helpful and we will definitely plan to stay here on our next trip to the city by the bay!

<Content>Good location, Good deal. We arrived at about 10.30pm after an 18 hour journey from the UK. The desk clerk was expecting us and even greeted me by name. Check in was quick and without any problems.The hotel is a five minute walk from the waterfront and about 10 minutes from the cable car terminus.The hotel was quiet and we felt very safe.We had a room on the city side with one Queen bed. Our room had been recently decorated and the 'Sealy' bed looked just a few months old and very comfortable. The room was small but adequate. The rooms on the bay side are larger with two beds.Continental breakfast was basic but included in the price. There are cereals, toast, bagels, fruit, juices and coffe to choose from.Beware parking charges of $17 per day.We would stay there agian but perhaps chose a larger room.

<Content>Horrible hotel! I was so very disappointed with this hotel. I felt safe staying at a well heard of hotel chain thinking I would not be leaving much to chance. The front desk staff is impersonal and impatient with questions. The rooms smell, there is no cable tv, the pillows on the beds are about the size of a piece of toast, and just as flat. The shower screamed and groaned when I turned it on and it had practically no water pressure. The pop machine was completely empty. Apparently with Comfort Inn you are just a number. There were absolutely no comforts that make staying in a hotel fun and relaxing. If you are going to San Fran stay somewhere else!!

<Content>'Great Comfort' , at the Comfort Inn Stayed at the Comfort Inn By the Bay April 9/04 We arrived at 11:30 pm, after a 10 hour travel dayOur body's were still on East Coast time so we felt like it was 3:30 am. We were checked in fast and with friendly service. The front desk gave us complementary parking, because they had a high school choir staying there that night,which caused a little congestion on the elevators, as the kids were busy visiting all around the hotel, just having fun.She told us they had a midnight curfew, and two minutes after 12 you wouldn't have known they were in the hotel at all. The rooms were very clean and had been recently renovated. I found the hotel to be very quiet and we all got a great nights sleep. The next morning we walked to fisherman's Wharf, and around the water front before checking out. I would stay here again and would highly reccomend this property to my friends.
