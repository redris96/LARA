<Content>good luxus hotel The location of the hotel is very good. It is directly at the Gendarmenmarkt and not far away from the street Unter den Linden and the Brandenburger Tor. The underground station is only 50 meters away. The lobby is very beautiful an the staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful. The corridors and the rooms are not very luxurious. The bathroom and the flatscreen tv are the most modern things. The bed is very comfortable. I woud only recommend an executive room at the 6th floor. There you have the possibility to visit the executive lounge. There you get your breakfast in the morning, coffee the whole day and fingerfood in the evening. Until 11 p.m. you get different sorts of wine, beer an other driks for example Glenfiddich Whisky. And all those things are included if you book an executive room. The other advantage of this lounge is, that you dont have to eat your breakfast with for about 100 other guests because this lounge is only for the guests of the 6th floor. With the bar Trader Vic's you have a good opinion to go out in the evening directly in the hotel. There is also a business center and a pool. The roomservice is very good and the prices are high, but fair for such an hotel. All in all a hotel with very good service with old looking rooms.

<Content>Eight nights at the Hilton I spent eight nights at the Hilton in Berlin - I mostly used the room to sleep; nothing more, nothing less.Even though my room was on the fifth floor, it had a rather unspectacular view on the house vis-脿-vis. The room was comfortable, but not very big (still more than enough for a single occupancy). The bed was comfortable and I immediately got a warmer blanket when I requested it. The bathroom seemed to be recently refurbished and was nice. So nothing to complain about the 'technicalities' of the room. The d茅cor, however, was not really to my taste: it combined brown and grey furniture (brrr); also the dark carpet and the worn armchair didn't really contribute to my personal coziness. In the end, the room corresponded very much to what I expect from an average American chain hotel. But is a five star Hilton supposed to be 'the average'?I did not appreciate at all that the hotel separately charges for sauna use (10 or 12 鈧? I don't recall). From my point of view this kind of service should be included in the price of a five star hotel. Luckily, as a member of HHonors, I got access for free (but the place was nothing special).Oh, I almost forgot to mention: the location and the staff were great.

<Content>ok but some problems stayed for weekend, good points are location and excellent staff. the breakfast was also wonderful. down side. the bed was awful, far too soft and gave no support. it actually made trying to get to sleep difficult. also our room 8004 stunk of smoke. we should have complained but by the time we had arrived were too tired. i left the window open most of the time to try and get rid of the smokey smell.also there was very high step in and out of the shower which some people might find difficult.. for a luxury hotel i felt a bit let down

<Content>Last Minute Top Secret Hotel Hstorical Gendarmenmarket Stayed at the 5 Star Hilton Berlin for two nights to experience the Christmas Markets and celebrate my friends birthday. We we allocated room 5088 which looked over an internal courtyard so very quiet but no view. Most importantly the room appeared clean and well maintained. The size of the room was adequate but the luxurious touches I would have expected from a hotel of this standard were in my opinion poor. There were robes (not very large, soft or fluffy) and slippers, small, thin towels (in fact my friends had to share a towel). King size bed (plus added squeaky springs) with two single duvets. Minimal tea  coffee (one cup per day) and mini bar. The room also had ironing facilites. There was a pool and spa but I don't have experience them. With last minute it was room only so no idea what the breakfast was like. The redeeming point was the hotel's location which was superb. If you can get a room at a good price I would stay here but if paying rack rate there are other hotels with far superior facilities available in Berlin

<Content>Central location for tourists I would highly recommend the Berlin Hilton for its cleanliness, friendly and helpful staff, and for its' central location to most of the historical sites.While we were there the annual Marathon run was on and the transportation above ground was virtually shut down for the afternoon so we took a hop-on-hop-off bus tour in the morning, took a boat cruise in the afternoon, and walked for the balance of our time. The only negatives that I have are with all of the Hilton Hotels - exorbitant internet rates and breakfast buffets. Unless you take the buffet there is no other breakfast option and coffee and an egg with toast is not worth 22-25 Euros.Obviously it is not enough to keep us away, we just find alternatives outside the hotel. One we enjoyed was the Lowenbrau restaurant around the corner from the Hilton complete traditional German foods and with a full band on Saturday night.

<Content>Lovely Hotel in good central location Easy walk to a lot of the main sites in Berlin- 15-20 mins to the Brandenberg Gate. Across the street is the amazing Fassbender  Rausch chocolate shop. A couple of blocks walk to some beautiful shops. Plenty of places to eat nearby.The rooms were lovely  had tea/coffee making facilities but no iron/ironing board. Staff we friendly  efficient.The minibar was somewhat unusual in that as soon as an item was picked up/moved you were charged if you didn't put it back within 30secs!.As mentioned before internet connection was very expensive.

Room service was quick, the food though was average which was surprising. Internet is 17EUR a day which is crazy - the internet should be standard, basic, not an extra! Room was a good size and the bathroom nice - all very clean. The Tube is right outside the door - Stadtmitte - for info. Taxi to Tegel airport was 19EUR for info.

<Content>Expensive but good Stayed 3 nights in a junior suite which was great with a gorgeous bathroom, but breakfast was not included and the room cost 414 Euros per night which is far more that any other hotel I've ever stayed in. However the views from the room of the cathedral and the Gendarmenmarkt were fantastic! U-Bahn right outside the door and the tour bus stops very nearby. Try the sweet hot chocolate in the cafe above the chocolate shop next door, it is to die for!Had dinner in the Mark Brandenberg restaurant which was excellent, also in Lutter and Wegner across the road, similarly good with an amazing choice of wines.Last night ate in Diverso, an Italian along the road, which was good.Loved Berlin, all the history and the atmosphere were just what I imagined.

They also have a nice pool and spa but the children at all hours in the pool will drive you to the nudist spa area, which is pretty nice and child free. There are several good restaurants near by.We loved the eastern sector location with it's delightful walking areas and proximity to museum island and gorgeous neo-classical architecture. The Potsdammer Platz is very times square with it's glass and steel highrises and heavy traffic.The rooms are very comfortable - typical Hilton decor - nice sheets and good showers.The concierge was very helpful with local restaurants.The lounge had a great breakfast and offered drinks through the day including wine, etc. at evenings with appetizers.

<Content>A Hilton is a Hilton This hotel was in a superb location - right near several museums, Checkpoint Charlie and the Brandenburg Gate. Wonderful shopping was right around the corner and well within an easy walk. Also many great restaurants are only a very short walk away. The Hotel was clean, courteous and typical for a large chain hotel. Internet use was a bit of a hassle since you have to use their business center and they charge you first but if you are not over your useage amount you get your deposit back. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and had many, many selections with attentive staff. I would stay here again when visiting Berlin.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We (4 adults, 2 rooms) stayed at the Hilton Berlin for 3 nights in July 2008. We had an absolutely wonderful experience, I would highly recommend the hotel.We arrived at the Hilton around 9 am and were able to check in but not able to access our rooms yet. The front desk staff was quite apologetic even though we knew this would be the case. We were upgraded from a basic room to a room that faced the Gendarmenmarkt and had wonderful large windows that opened so we were able to hear the outdoors concerts going on there.We each had a double room that consisted of a medium sized bathroom that was very clean and well maintained. There were two large closets on of which had shelves and a safe, the other had room for hanging clothes. There were slippers and robes available although the robes had definitely seen better days. There was a queen size bed with soft bedding and pillows. The room also had an arm chair and a desk. The room had a mini-bar which I did not like because it was one that charged you whenever an item was moved.The room and the whole hotel were very cleaned and well maintained (much different from many of the other Hiltons I have stayed in). The staff at the front desk was very polite and helpful. The concierge desk was the biggest downfall in service as there never seemed to be anyone there to help you. One time we waited about 15 minutes for help there one day and no concierge actually showed up to help us.

<Content>Great business hotel in an excellent location Stayed three nights at the Berlin Hilton, and it has to be one of the best Hiltons I have stayed in for a long time. I attended a conference at the hotel and found the hotel excellent in every way. The room was in one corner on floor 4 and was larger than most, with a double aspect. Room was very clean and well appointed. Food in the restaurant and during the conference was also excellent.Location: Easy walk to Checkpoint Charlie and Brandenburg Gate easy.....and I see from other reports it you walk many other places. Taxi to/from Tegel airport is about 25 mins and cost less than 20 Euros.Got access to the Exec Lounge on floor 6, as he was on that floor. This was also very well appointed with free bar and food.

Very nice staff, especially check-in/check-out was very good at the reception. A bit old but clean, nice rooms. I have Honors Gold VIP card, but not upgraded or not offered anything else. I'd recommend to stay at this hotel if you compare price/qulaity with other hotels.

<Content>Good location not far from Mitte!!! Stay in this hotel for 5 nights with a package excluding breakfast and found this is a rather pleasant stay. I was attending a convention at ICC in the west of Berlin and the subway is right in front and it took me about 20 mins to reach ICC. This hotel is walking distance to Brundenberg Gate, and to other museums nearby such as Jewish Musseum, etc. And it is also easy to get from here to Mitte district. We walked everywhere in this area for 5 days and had a really good time. The restaurants in Charlottenberg Strasse are very good. Fredrichstrasse, which is the main shopping street in East Berlin is about 200 yards away. Excellent night life, bars, restaurants and late nights cinemas in Mitte district make it exciting to stay in this hotel. Service is good, drink prices at the bar is reasonable, but breakfast is overprice. Be sure to one that include bf if you like your bf. Alternatively have one across the street on Fredrichstrasse. Used the gym and pool and they were adequate. Hotel staff speak good english and are very helpful in giving out general information

<Content>Not so good I booked this hotel because of the good reviews on Tripadvisor but it was quite dissappointing. I was traveling by myself and I was given a two single bed room, I asked if they could change it for a one bed room and they told me that they couldn't change the category of the room, I replied that it wasn't a change of the category but a change of beds and they told me that they would try but it would be difficult; of course I didn't have my room changed. There were broken things in the bathroom too like a hanger.On the other side, cleanliness is not good either. I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in a row and they didn't change sheets during my whole stay (inacceptable for a hotel that claims to be 5 stars). Breakfast is good and plenty of choice but the service once again left a lot to be desired; the rest of the people were escorted to the tables and served coffee and freshly squezzed orange juice, I had to order it several times. All in all I would give this hotel 3 star; the only good thing about it is its location.

<Content>Location.. Staff... Service.. Very good I was very happy with the Hilton Berlin. I was there for a quick weekend, one night over Easter. I was upgrade to a Jr. Suite and to the Executive lounge. The room, clean and nice. Not the most modern, but still nice. The room was clean, and had fresh flowers. The bathroom was on the small size but ok. The Ex Lounge, was not that large but did not run in to any problems getting a place to sit. There was free drinks and snacks all day. Free internet on their computer. The Location, this hotel is right above the city center U- Bahn station. Also less then 15 min walk to Check point Charley, and other sights. The Staff, was very helpful.. They made every effort to make my stay very nice.. Check in, I got the the hotel early, and the room was not ready yet., I was given access to the Ex Lounge and had Breakfast (this is before I even got a room) The also held my bags.. Easter, because I was at the Hilton over the Easter holiday the hotel was booked out. I was happy to see that the Easter Bunny made it to my room. I had some Easter candy outside my room. There was 2 bunnies and some egg candy.. It was also nice high end candy. This was a nice touch. Breakfast, was included and I had it in the main restaurant, they also set up a temp. place to eat in one of the event halls, because of the sold out night and it was Easter Sunday. There was a very large spread.. a made to order station.. Some of the items were cold, and the service was not the best. You can tell they called in the backup staff. I think if it was not free (included) I would not have been so happy. Over all, very nice hotel, you can find some deals at this Hotel. The location is the best, and it was a clean, quite and nice hotel..

<Content>Happy at the Hilton We stayed at the Hilton for a long weekend in Feb 2008. We stayed in an executive room and had access to the executive lounge. We finally got our luggage after a room mixup. We were a little miffed at the short wait but it did not matter that much. The room itself was comfortable but the bed was a little soft. The mini fridge did decide to gurgle at random times and the bathroom fan took an age to stop which was annoying when you wanted to go to sleep. Otherwise we had a nice room with a view on the internal courtyard which was not terribly exciting.The executive lounge though pleasant was far too small. Hilton have obviously been very tight here and could easily expand the lounge at the cost of say one bedroom. We had to wait for a seat sometimes but did not wait long. You do get a good view from the lounge.The food was very nice, especially breakfast. Pre dinner snacks did vary and the hotel have for some reason a passion for horseradish. They put it on almost everything, which was not necessary. I hate becks beer and that was it on the beer front. The decent scotch whiskey disappeared after our first night and never came back. The staff were very friendly and did their utmost to make you feel comfortable.The swimming pool was very nice but a little cold. The jacuzzi was a rather feeble effort and joined on the side of the swimming pool. Build them separately please! There are plenty of restaurants to choose from in the hotel or not too far away. You may have to walk a bit!The hotel is located next to Stadtmitte U-Bahn station. Do not get off at Mohrenstrasse as you will have to walk! We took the airport bus from Tegel Airport and this takes you to Unter den Linden which is not too far to walk from the hotel. Also buy a Berlincard and for 48/72 hours you will have all transport included (+ airport bus) and discounted entrance to lots of attractions. You can buy the Berlin card at the airport. At Tegel airport look for the information signs. Costs 鈧?1.50 for 72 hours.The hotel is not far from Checkpoint Charlie and the Brandenberg gate which makes it a good base for sightseeing. We had a great time.

<Content>Well pleased with this I spent four nights here on a city break, my first in Berlin. I really landed on my feet with this one. The public rooms are lovely, the staff friendly and helpful, and the rooms comfortable. The location is good too, very central to downtown Berlin and with convenient access to public transport.A couple of restaurants provide good eating choice and if they don't cut it for you, there are plenty of bars and coffee shops nearby.Only one minus springs to mind: the breakfast, though good, is rather pricey.

<Content>Fantastic experience This charming hotel located in what was East Berlin exceeded my expectations in every respect. The lobby is large and luxurious, the staff was helpful and respectful beyond compare. My room was a corner suite on the executive floor, with a large living area which included a desk, sofa, two chairs, coffee table and large flat screen TV. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and marble. The bedroom had a large very comfortable king sized bed and another television. Breakfast was included (fortunately, since it is 23 Euros if not included...ouch!) and consisted of a large array of food from which to choose. The location of the hotel is ideal, with an underground stop directly across the street. The views of the plaza across from the hotel are spectacular. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>New Years in Berlin - Wonderful hotel I stayed three nights in the Berlin Hilton over the New Year's holiday with my girlfriend. The hotel is well placed in the city, a few blocks from the Brandenberg gate and the Reichstag. If you like high end shopping you'll love staying here.The rooms were comfortable. We were staying on points and were entitled to a room upgrade and free breakfast. There was no upgraded room when we arrived on New Year's Eve as the place was full, so we were placed in a regular room. The room was normal by European standards (small to an American) but the bed was comfortable and the design of the room was excellent. We were very comfortable.We were able to upgrade our second night in to a suite on the Executive level. The room was very large and comfortable, although the bed was less comfortable than in the previous room. THe Executive lounge was much better than most of the lounges I have experienced in the United States, but the breakfast spread was not nearly as elaborate as the hotel breakfast buffet, which was outstanding, The breakfast buffet was pricey (US$30!!! each), but was as good as or better than your average Champagne Sunday brunch in the States, which is similarly priced.There are more reasonably priced restaurants very close to the hotel. In fact, there is a department store food court less than a block away.The staff and service was outstanding. I speak German, but most of the staff spoke outstanding English, which was great for my girlfriend. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Repetaed visits In 2007 I stayed three times here with a total of 22 nights. I find this hotel a reliable value and would join the other reviewers about this place.I especially found house keeping helpful, polite and being very motivated. The turn down service (on request) was less reliable, though some of the staff did a very good job (otherwise turn down did not include emptying paper waste baskets or cleaning glasses, but just and only opening the bed and closing the curtains).What I found a bit annoying was not being welcomed as a regular guest, returning for several years. Maybe this is due to my lost gold status in 2007 (which I gladly regained by now). Instead I was told (for the second time) that their computer system has changed. It will recognise me as a frequent guest at my fourth stay in that hotel. In my mind previous data should be retained and not simply deleted when it comes to customer relations.We have been to the restaurant Mark Brandenburg twice, good service and quality, though not outstanding. And we have been to Trader Vic's on Christmas Eve. It started with a waitress that did not listen to our ordering. It continued with only one starter (we shared) instead of two. We ordered white wine by the glass and had to insist on two other staff to have it (while the hot starter was waiting at our table). One of the main dishes was not cooked to order. The table was not set correctly (which should be in such a place) and the red wine was out of sight, as well. We did complain and after that the restaurant manager got involved and ameliorated the situation. But the restaurant experience was already spoiled.Though having been a frequent guest and satisfied so far, I personally would look for an alternative among the abundance of good hotels in Berlin due to my somewhat frustrations after all (Swissotel, Palace and Intercontinental are outstanding hotels, but there are many more alternatives).But if you should prefer a Hilton for other reasons, this will be a reliably choice.

<Content>Berlin Hilton - December 2007 Excellent We stayed at the Hilton Berlin whilst visiting the Christmas markets. The hotel location was very central good access from airport on the bus/underground and easy to find. (Underground station opposite hotel). We were fortunate to receive a room over looking the main square.Hotel was immaculate, with very attentive staff. The concierge service was most informative and helpful. The piano bar in the entrance lobby was a pleasant welcoming experience.The exstensive breakfast selection was superb and well presented in attractive surroundings, and again attentive staff.We would highly recomended this hotel.

<Content>Great choice The Hilton Berlin is a great choice for either business or pleasure. It is a solid 4 star by American standards (which are higher than European standards). I stay there on business. The staff is very professional and efficient. The rooms are very clean. Service is excellent. The breakfast buffet is a bounty of tasty choices. The surrounding area is made up of high end shops. Mass transit just outside bldg. Enjoy!

<Content>Hilton was just fine We, a Scottish couple, decided to visit Berlin for four days and after reading positive reviews regarding the location of the Hilton, we decided to opt for that. On our arrival, we discovered that the hotel had overbooked and that there was to be no room there for our first night. We were a bit annoyed because the location of the hotel had been our primary reason for booking. We were asked to have one night in the Intercontinental and come back to the Hilton for the remainder of our stay.The Intercontinental was fine and on our return to the Hilton I have to say that the staff could not do enough for us. We had a room upgrade and a variety of gifts, free dinner, etc, to apologise for our inconvenience. The staff and in particular, Doreen the acting front desk manager were all superb and truly went out of their way to make our stay more special.Breakfast choice was great, only slight criticism was the room where you have breakfast, sort of reminded me of a works canteen but that aside, choices were good and plenty of food available.Overall, you could do a lot worse than to go to the Berlin Hilton as the location is absolutely spot on for the underground, shopping and sightseeing and of course at this time of year there are a few Christmas markets within walking distance. All in all, we had a great time.

<Content>Great location and friendly staff! I had read several reviews prior to arriving at the hotel to help manage expectations. Overall, this hotel has some of the friendliest staff of any hotel I have ever stayed. The hotel entrance and main lobby are very nice and grand. I was greeted a friendly desk person who advised I am in the Exec Floor. She promptly handed me a key to access the elevators and I checked in on that floor. I had read and it is true the hotel hallways, which are endless, are drab (green carpet and gray stained panels). My room had a nice bathroom and it was spacious. I had heard the rooms were small, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had friends staying at the Radisson, although their hotel was much newer and modern, the room was significantly smaller than mine. I had nightly turndown service as well. On one note, the hotel housekeeping staff are aggressive. They would be waiting for me to depart in the mornings around 8:00 am or so and get started cleaning. If you stay be sure to use your privacy door tag. The one bad experience I had was at Trader Vic's. The only thing I can contribute it to is just poor management. There were 3 people working this huge restaurant besides the 2 bartenders. The bartenders sat their half the time while the rest of the staff sat people, checked coats and served food. Cocktails and appetizers took an exceptionally long time. Again our server was very friendly, but just overwhelmed. I would highly recommend staying, although the rack rate seemed steep. I stayed on points, so the value was nice for me.

<Content>Great location, reliable service Stayed here for two nights on a city break trip. Took me ages to decide which hotel to stay in while in Berlin, but eventually plumped for this one as got a great rate through Expedia, and I figured I wouldn't go far wrong with a Hilton. I was right.Location was superb - literally right next to Stadtmitte U-Bahn - and on the side of a beautiful square (we paid a bit extra for a view and it was worth it). No issues with noise being on the street side of the hotel.Room impressively large and very clean. Bathroom very modern although our shower seemed to do something odd after about 5 minutes of being in it, i.e. the water pressure would drop to the point where there was no way I was going to get the shampoo out of my hair!We didn't have breakfast included and didn't visit the buffet (have to admit I flinched at the 23 Euros price tag). There are loads of cafes nearby where you can get something yummy.We did eat at the Mark Brandenburg restaurant at the hotel though and that was very good.All in all, would definitely stay again.

<Content>Living up to Hilton expectations We spent 3 nights at the Hilton Berlin in June. The hotel has a great location just above a U/S bahn stop. The hotel provided the same Hilton reliability that I expect. The room was very nice with a small balcony over looking the Gendarmenmarkt. We were given breakfast coupons for each morning which really helped out since the dollar is so weak versus the euro. The selection and quality of food was also very good. I would absolutely recommend the hotel for the location and its quality.Note: If you are taking the S/U Bahn to this hotel get off at Stadtmitte. The station can be a bit confusing, but one of the several entrances/exits comes up directly in front of the Hilton.

<Content>bizpro Our stay was very enjoyable. As Senior Hilton VIP we were upgraded to one junior suite and one normal Quen room on the excutive floor. The staff everywhere was very helpfull and polite. The rooms were spotless; the bathrooms were small but efficient use of space allowed to have a nice soaker tub.The breakfast buffet was excellent and the lounge treats were generous, including free liquor.Due to extensive construction work in Berlin it was a bit challening to find the hotel. (Herz at Tegel did not provide clear instruction) The location is great.There is only one suggestion: provide onions and capers for the smoked salmon =). If booked early, rates can be as low as 50% off and in general Gold  Diamond members will be upgraded so I would gamble on a room rate without breakfast. Compared to other hotels the rates are normal for the location but services exceed the standard of other hotels in the same category.

<Content>Typical Hilton It鈥檚 a typical Hilton, ideally located within walking distance of the main sights with Checkpoint Charlie just 3 minutes walk away and the underground station (Stadtmitte) directly outside the door. I recommend you buy an underground pass from the airport on arrival, to cover the days of your stay.Breakfast was fantastic, a generous choice for all palates, so take the breakfast option when you book. There are also many good quality restaurants close to the hotel. The pool is a nice bonus, remembering that this is a city centre hotel, not a leisure spa.Rooms are as you would expect from a Hilton: TV, expensive mini-bar, safe, room service, bath robes, etc.

<Content>We're going back it was that good Stayed at Hilton for 4 nights just before Easter and very impressed. Arrived on overnight train from Paris and called in at 8.30am to drop off bags but were taken straight to our room by seriously friendly staff and were unpacked and on the streets by 9am. The hotel is an old Four Seasons and a cut above your normal Hilton. We travel a lot - business and pleasure, everything from basic bed and breakfasts to five star hotels - and the bedroom ticked all the boxes as did the public areas - don't really understand some of the more lukewarm comments about this place! Breakfast is a more than generous buffet spread and sets you up for the rest of the day - well worth trying to book the pay in advance bed and breakfast package. Pool more than adequate - remember it's not a leisure centre it's a hotel. View over Gendarmarkt while you're eating breakfast is fantastic - very difficult to beat this breakfast room location. Just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie and the old East Berlin has got to be the best part of Berlin to stay in. And an underground right outside the hotel front door - well one of them - just be careful to go up the right steps - there's loads of exits from one underground and you can end up several minutes walk away from the hotel if you choose the wrong one! We're going back in October with our 14 year old daughter.

<Content>Great deal - surprisingly accommodating to families. Stayed at the Berlin Hilton over a long weekend in August. Location was prime as it is within walking distance of the main sights (Brandenburg Gate/Checkpoint charlie/Berlin Wall/Pergamon/Altesmuseum) and there is a U-bahn train station (Stadtmitte) directly across the street from the hotel. (We took this to the zoo). Breakfast was traditional Hilton fare. There are many nearby quality restaurants as well. Room was quiet.  The pool and workout room were adequate and always available. Had one meal at the Trader Vic's in the hotel which was nice and they brought out special drinks (sans alcohol) for the kids . This was a little pricey - you can find better elsewhere but the little ones were pooped after all the walking.The rooms were clean/spacious and they provided us interconnecting rooms with a baby cot for our youngest. (we got the second room @ 1/2 price from the Hilton family deal.).Would stay here again if I go to Berlin.

The staff at the hotel couldn't do enough to help and were very cheerful. The food was good. The laundry service was efficient and returned earlier than expected. We stayed there with our teenage boys, so the Gym and pool facilities were great for them. If I had to pick out a fault, it was that the mattresses were very hard but it didn't effect my stay at all. This is a great place to chill out after a long day sightseeing.We would definately stay there again.

<Content>Great Choice I chose the Hilton for its central location and moderate cost, and was very pleasantly surprised by the room.The Hilton occupies almost an entire city block in stylish Mitte, the cultural and historical heart of Berlin. Across the street is the Gendarmenmarkt, a huge public square containing the city鈥檚 concert hall and two domed cathedrals now used as minor museums. A couple of blocks away is grand Unter den Linden, lined with neoclassical structures executed on a truly Germanic scale, and leading to most major sights, from the Berliner Dom (cathedral) to Brandenburger Tor (gate) and the Reichstag. Also check out the wonderful Gemaldegalerie (Picture Gallery) near Potsdamer Platz. Across the street from the Hilton is a U-Bahn (subway) station, which can get you to Charlottenburg Palace and, by easy connection with S-Bahn (suburban rail), to the palaces and town of Potsdam. The hotel is only a block from the fashionable shopping of Friedrichstrasse. You really must put aside any preconceptions you may have of dreary East Berlin. It鈥檚 a beautiful city. One thing you won鈥檛 find in Mitte is too many ordinary Germans. I noticed lots of upscale trattoria, but not a single traditional brauhaus. If I make it back I will budget a couple of days to check out some of the city鈥檚 more typical residential areas. In general, this is a city where you will need more time than you think.My standard room was large by Europeans standards, and very respectable by American ones. It was tastefully decorated in traditional style, with a king bed. The only odd thing was that all the wood trim was painted-gray. Seriously, how much would some walnut stain cost? My room was on the dull courtyard, making it very quiet though. The large bathroom was done in black and white granite or marble, but had the flood-prone half-shower door prevalent on the Continent. They left robes, slippers, and every evening, little candies. The public facilities were OK but less impressive than the room. They have no real bar, except for a corner (overpriced) of the lobby atrium. There is a Trader Vic鈥檚, but I don鈥檛 think I could enter such a place without being drunk already. As you might expect given their aggressive pricing, most of the Hilton clientele seems to be flight crews and American old ladies with tour groups. The Adlon it鈥檚 not. Still, with in room high speed internet and a premium business class floor, the Hilton should also be a good choice for business travel. My only caution is that Berlin is a huge, sprawling city, with heavy traffic at times. You probably want to find out where you need to be and stay close by. Most international travelers consider Hilton more of a punch line than an actual place to stay. That is not at all justified in the case of the Berlin Hilton.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location This is the third time that I have stayed at this hotel and I am pleased to report that my satisfaction remains just as high as on the first visit. The hotel gives a luxury experience at a reasonable price. The staff were very welcoming and efficient. and our room was immaculately clean and comfortable. The hotel is located in a smart square within easy walking distance of Unter Den Linden, the Reichstag, the Brandenberg Gate and many of the other tourist attractions. The breakfast is the usual good Hilton buffet, and there are several restaurants in the hotel: this time we used the (German cooking) Mark Brandenberg and the (Italian) Fellini. Both were satisfactory and reasonable value for money. (In my book, Germany is not a great country for gourmet cuisine). I will certainly go back to the Hilton when I next visit Berlin.

<Content>Beware Hotel's Charges Hotel is well-situated near main attractions, restaurants and shopping. Room was clean, well furnished and serviced promptly. The room air conditioning had a hard time keeping up with the warm temperatures in Berlin. The restaurant (Mark Brandenburg) was over-priced and had marginal food. The hotel was overrun with meetings and groups.There was an unexplained, additional Hotel charge of 8 Euros that appeared on my credit card statement. I challenged the charge in an e-mail to the hotel, and followed up with e-mails to the Hotel (twice), HiltonHonors and Hilton corporate. None of these Hilton entities have had the courtesy of even responding (no less reversing this charge) in over a week.

<Content>Fantastic! My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Hotel - Berlin for 3 nights during the last week in May. This hotel is a great place to stay!The room was extremely neat , clean, and nicely decorated. It had TV and a nice king bed. The bathroom had a shower in the tub. No complaints about the room.The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. Other reviews allude to not-so-good experiences with the concierge, but to us he was extremely helpful. Everyone spoke execellent English and no-one seemed to mind my less-than-perfect German.As one reviewer stated, the lobby bar/lounge is a good place to sit, relax, and have a bite to eat or a glass of beer. The Mark Brandenburger Restaurant was excellent. There is a Trader Vic's Restaurant in the building, too, that was really good. In both these restaurants the staff were terrific. I didn't see a cafeteria in the lobby area that one reviewer described.Most of Berlin's sights are within walking distance from this hotel, so my car wasn't needed during our stay. My wife and I made use of the U-bahn to visit the Berlin Zoo, an entrance to the U-bahn almost directly outside the front door of the hotel.My wife and I will definitely stay at the Hilton Hotel - Berlin again if we ever come back to Berlin.

<Content>I gotta get back there! We first stayed at the Hilton in April 2002 and chose it for its' proximity to the Deutsches Opera, a ten minute walk away across the beautiful square. We weren't expecting to spend much time in the hotel but we did want to have a view of the Dom from our bedroom and wanted to be high off the street to minimise traffic noise. A room on the Executive floor offered this.We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel and its' staff and so...Four years later we were lured back to Berlin by the opera and there was real no decision making involved in choosing a hotel.The famous Adlon is historic and was considered for a moment but the location is too busy with sightseers. We had no dislikes regarding the Hilton and were in fact looking forward to staying there again.We arrived at 6pm after a spirited drive from Frankfurt. A valet parked the car-there is a fee for parking in the attached garage which I think was 17E a day, while we went straight to the 6th floor check-in. This takes place in the cosy Club room where breakfast, afternoon and evening snacks are served. Drinks-spirits, wines, beer and sodas are complimentary and after a 350 mile drive I needed one (or two).The young women who staff the Club are real ambassadors for the hotel-friendly efficent and super-industrious.The hotel room is not huge but we don't have parties or practice our golf swings in them. They are tastefully decorated with lots of wooden furniture and comfy beds with duvets. Extra pillows were ordered as were extra hangers and they appeared within minutes as did our luggage. The windows are ingenious and open in two different planes so one can lean out and get some fresh air or puff on a cigarette.Outside the window was Berlin! It had hardly seemed to matter on our first visit as we were there for the opera and the city was almost immaterial but having seen it once and warmed to it, massive construction notwithstanding, we were excited to see more of it and revisit places that had been so pleasurable before (Spreewald and Sans Souci come to mind) I had kept the rental car for day trips outside the city as the countryside around Berlin is peaceful and easy on the eye. You can rent a car from Sixt in the hotel. I use Hertz booked in the USA. For exploring the city though it makes little sense to drive and have the hassle of finding parking. The U Bahn at Stadtmitte station in front of the hotel is the way to go-it's fast and cheap and easy to find your way around. Trains are safe and clean.Like every hotel I stay in there are parts of it I don't get time to visit and parts of it I might camp out in. Spa? What spa? However the bar area in the lobby is a great place to people-watch while having a cold beer or a tasty snack. Service is attentive and the quality of the food is exceptional for a bar area although the menu is short. The spaghetti a la carbonara had me licking the plate but I don't think anyone noticed. At night this bar has a small jazz combo with vocalist but the volume level doesn't impede conversation unless you ask for a table next to the drummer. It is not a hang out for people under 40. If you are from the USA don't expect to be tipping like you do back home. This ain't New York.I have seen criticism of the concierge in these reviews but I have no cause to compalin as they were always helpful and efficient.If someone gives you good or bad service it is good to identify them to management so their behaviour can be rewarded or corrected. They arranged a great city tour for us and helped us with directions and reccommendations. They are kept constantly busy.There is a handy little gift shop in one corner of the lobby where one can buy snacks and drinks for the room if you are mini-bar shy like me. I haul my beers and wine from a supermarket a block away. Next to that shop in the corner of the lobby is a cafeteria where you can load up a tray full of hot German food for way less than 10E including beer and dessert. Great value if you are pressed for time and just need to refuel for more sightseeing.As mentioned in many reviews the Gendarmenmarkt area is well served by good restaurants- Aigner, Lutter and Wegner etcbut the food and service in the Mark Brandenburger just off the Hilton lobby is hard to beat. Both Aigner and Lutter waitstaff show visible disappointment when you don't order a bottle of wine and both are tight rooms where the noise level registers DIN on the scale. Brandenburger is a civilised Oasis in comparison and the view of the German Dom at night reminds you that you are in that very special city called Berlin.In summary-the Hilton is a large, busy city hotel. I consider it very well run from my two visits there. The rooms may not be spectacular or huge but they are tastefully appointed and everything performs its' function. Huge bathrooms can be found in Las Vegas. A few words spoken in German will get you even friendlier service. No one on staff was ever less than helpful despite their workload. Room service was prompt and tasty but there are many dining options just outside your door and in clement weather (Easter onwards) many restaurants around the square set up tables in the plaza. Much of your sightseeing can be done on foot from the Hilton. If you like museums or tour boat rides there is hardly any city better equipped to indulge you than Berlin. There are airplane rides in vintage aircraft and seaplane tours if you want to see Berlin's vast sprawl from the air.I can't wait to go back as there is so much to still to be scratched off my list!Bavarian ChicagoUSA

<Content>Quality in a convenient location. A high quality hotel with a good standard of accommodation and facilities, and in an excellent position for walking to most of the main sights of the city. The rooms are only medium sized but recently refurbished, well equipped and very comfortable. Any item taken out of the mini-bar is automatically charged to your account via electronic detectors - even if you put it back; but the reception staff are very understanding if you make this mistake. In fact the staff were always very courteous and helpful. My only gripe is that breakfast, at 23 Euros, was pricey - excellent quality and loads of it, but if you only want or can only manage a small breakfast then it is not good value, and we found really good breakfasts with personal service at local cafes (notably Mohring and Dressler).

All the museum are within short walking distance, public transportation in front of the hotel (also the busstop for the direct bus to airport Tegel is nearby), nice shops around the corner and good restaurants nearby. The only time I used the public transportation, was to go to West Berlin (Kudamm). But I prefer East Berlin and the Hilton is perfectly situated. I would definately return here! Look around for a good price. I paid only EUR 100 per room per night, including breakfast! I booked this through an travel agent. I also approached the Hilton directly, but they couldn't offer my this price.

Nevertheless, the Hilton revealed itself as a great experience and a great hotel. I stayed at the business floor. The rooms are big, clean and beautiful. Bathroom was extremely clean and functional, although not very big. Breakfast was amazing. Staff was helpful and always had a smile. Lobby is huge and there was live music at the bar.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I have just returned from a 4 day visit to Berlin. I was accompanying my husband on a business trip and had 2 mornings enjoying the city. We lodged at the Hilton. This hotel is in a very central position just a few steps away from a leading shopping street and also opposite the magnificent Gendarmenmarkt. The service was excellent. Hotel boasts of 4 restaurants varying from the typical german cusine to the polynesian, complementing these is the Fellini restaurant which is an Italian restaurant. Room was of a decent size and included all amenities, including a coffee maker, bathroom was well equipped and maintained. We had an early morning check-out and we did appreciate a little buffet breakfast at the lobby specially prepared by the hotel staff for those who leave before 6.00 (normal breakfast time). All in all I think that this hotel has hilton quality complemented by german standards. Highly recomended.

Well the hotel is very good maybe in need of a smarten up and rooms even on executive floor are on the small side but of a high standard. However that's a small price to pay for the perfect location and exceptional service and staff, especially on the executive floor. The pool and sauna area (extra charge) were superior. Would defintely recommend it and will stay there when back in Berlin.

<Content>happy at the hilton lucky to miss the fog and delayed flights by a few days so arrived at tagel airport 27 dec 2006 ok ,wife and i prefer to use public transport if possible so purchased tickets at kiosk at airport exit and caught bus 128 to kurt schumacher platz metro stop,using same ticket caught u6 metro to stadmitte(all for under 5 euro for 2 people).at stadmitte use walkway and head towards u2 line,only then at this point go up the steps and your infront of hotel.yes it is cumbersome to lug bags up steps,i personally think it should be a european law that all members of parliment utilise public transport, then and only then, will they place a metro/rail stop at every airport.we felt that stadmitte was a clean and prosperous area of berlin,the bars and restaurants were smart and spotlessly clean (has in most places we went).found berlin on occasion to be a trifle high on some prices, over 5 euro for a coffee,4.5 euro for half a beer,but the quality was allways there in the service etc which was nice.went on the city tour which was good, 20 euro's which enabled you to get your bearings,did see better buses and various prices ,our bus i think had allready served one life in london?. would suggest to join onto a city guide,ours was very lively and informative,took us to brandenburg gate,luftwaffe office,checkpoint charlie,and hitlers bunkeri you wish, go by metro to }friedrichstr /oranienburgerstr.a little dated tram area. younger element bars and restaurantspotsdamer platz.ultra modern restaurant/shopping areakurfursten damm/wittenbergplatzvery busy area,markets,shops and so much more, plus the large shopping mall, kadewe very impressive !!don't miss on your doorstep, lafayette at franzosische str q 250/7 very impressive shopping mall.also across from the hotel, the gendarmenmarket. very pretty enclosed area. has for the hotel well pleased,other than the automated charge if you moved an item in the fridge ? i had allready paid for the hotel so will not be so forthcoming with a card number when asked for one on arrival next time.still waiting on return to see if they have charged us ,for moving a bottle.

<Content>Great Location - but not the usual Hilton Standard We were in Berlin to celebrate a friend's birthday and to visit the Christmas Markets. In terms of Berlin and the proximity to all the great sites/areas - this hotel is in a very good position. Berlin is one of my favourite cities - and you cannot go wrong in this location.The breakfast was also ok; lobby bar is fair; but the Trader Vics bar lounge is awful, kitsch and tacky.The reception is vast and anonymous. Check in efficient but inflexible re: early arrivals. We had to walk around town and come back after 4pm. Not great when you want to have a quick shower and freshen up.The rooms are very basic. Very few have a decent view i.e. over the beautiful square to the front. Our first two rooms were so small and so musty, we complained. We got upgraded, but to our horror, the bathroom in the suite had not been cleaned satisfactorily. In fact, it was pretty dirty.So - great location, basic rooms. Not the usual Hilton standard.

<Content>Great place to stay in Berlin ! I was here for the World Cup 2006 and this is one great place to stay in Berlin. The front desk was very receptive considering that SAS had lost my credit card while testing the self-checkin kiosks at CPH airport so I showed up at the front desk of the Hilton w/out a credit card. I hope this is the last time this happens to me. The breakfast buffet is wonderful and it was included in my rate. The subway station is just steps from the main entrance of the hotel. I will stay at the Hilton Berlin anytime.

<Content>What a great hotel....Loved it. We are making a regular thing of going to Germany to visit the Christmas Markets. Last year, Cologne, this year Berlin. We love the whole gluhwein, street entertainment, Christmassy ideas, so duly booked we arrived in Berlin on 24/11/06.Yes, we got it wrong!! The markets in Berlin did not officially start until 27/11/06 so we were a bit bothered that Berlin would have little to offer us for the 3 day duration. How wrong we were. Berlin is fantastic, so too is the Hilton Berlin hotel. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we all agree that we felt very welcome and that nothing was too much trouble. We were very happy with our rooms overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt - indeed we could see the Christmas market being set up- we thought the bathrooms were spot on and although the rooms themselves could do with a tiny bit of a makeover they were very comfortable and spotless.Breakfast was too die for. We sat for 2 hours enjoying the food and the company. On the Sunday we were treated to speciality coffees by a management trainee who seemed very eager to please us (Or everyone)The situation of the hotel is perfect. We walked everywhere but appreciated that if we need to go further afield the u-bahn station was right outside the door.Berlin is brill! Loads to see. The Reichstag building is stunning (and free). History surrounds you and you cannot help but become immersed in it - that surprised me, I learnt more in one weekend than any number of history lessons at school.To go back after a long day of sight seeing, good eating and drinking to the Hilton Berlin was the icing on the cake...Great.

<Content>Good service, very average rooms This hotel is well located in Berlin with easy access to the airports and public transport. Service is highly professional and consistently good. However the overall feel of the place is old fashioned, with long characterless corridors and rooms in need of an update and a refresh.Also, breakfast was a bit of a mad house, with long queues waiting for a table to become available.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location We stayed three nights from Saturday 12 to Tuesday 15 August 2006 in a double room. We arrived at the hotel very late at night after an evening flight and found the hotel easy to get to by public transport from the airport by train into the city centre and then a ten minute walk. The staff at receiption allocated our room quickly. Our room was spacious, well equipped with all the usual hotel furnishings with ensuit bathroom. The room was very comfortable, clean and tidy. A lovely touch was the chocolates (more like mini cakes) and the bottled water in our room on arrival. Our room overlooked an internal courtyard. We booked the hotel on a room only basis and prefering to spend our time outside sightseeing are unable to comment on the wide range of facilities available at this large hotel. The location is wonderful. It is next two an underground station with two train lines and the main attractions of the city are a comfortable 15 - 20 minutes walk. We would be very happy to return here or to recommend to others.

<Content>brilliant berlin we recently took a city break in Berlin with a couple of friends and stayed at the Hilton. What a great choice it turned out to be. We booked executive rooms which were excellent. Tanya at check in couldn't have been more helpful.The lounge itself was the perfect spot for some r and r after a long day siteseeing. It looks out over the pictureque Gendarmenmarkt with its beautiful cathedrals. Breakfast in the lounge is continental style however the buffet style breakfast in the main dining area was fantastic. We also had dinner in the Brandenberg restaurant attached the hotel which was superb. The waiting staff were attentive and the food was delightful. Full marks for service. The hotel is in our opinion ideally located for exploring the city and the Stadmitte U Bahn station is literally at the front door.We would highly recommend this hotel. We would also recommend the Berlin walking tour which commences from Starbucks beside the Brandenberg Gate at 1.15pm each afternoon and the Refugium restaurant beside the french Cathedral on Gendarmenmarkt. Superb food and excellent service. Try hiring a bike for the day and tour the sites, Tiergarten is a must. The concierge arranged them for us and in a matter of minutes they were at the front door and only 15 euro for the day.

<Content>Nice Hotel My husband I stayed 3 nights at the Berlin Hilton. Since we are Hilton Diamond members we were upgraded to the Executive level which gave us free internet access, breakfast, drinks and snacks. We were given a choice between breakfast in the concierge room or at the buffet in the restaurant. We tried both while we were there and both were great. However, the buffet in the restaurant had more selections. The hotel is clean and in a good location. It is in walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie and other sites. The staff at the Hilton that I encountered were all very nice. We took the Fat Tire Bike tour one day and I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Comfortable, good value Attractive hotel with comfortable rooms within walking distance of Checkpoint Charlie and many other East Berlin attractions. Underground railway station right in front of hotel, which is the best way to travel...all day ticket is six euros. We even went for a day in Potsdam on this same ticket. Trader Vic's Restaurant in the hotel is very nice, but expensive. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Booked on European website Opodo for best deal. If you're going to Berlin, you can't do better than this for the money (about $135 a night in August).

<Content>A city hotel to enjoy My wife and I have just spent 5 days here and felt it was everything one could have expected.The reception staff were first rate and made you feel really welcome.We had a lovely room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt.As for the staff on the Executive floor nothing was too much trouble,they were friendly, helpful and at breakfast one morning I commented that the hot choices did not have bacon that day, the hostess immediately said she would order some and it came within minutes. The hotels location is great with a Underground station right outside the hotel, and within walking distance of a number of places to visit. Our only regret was that we did not stay long enough, as there is so much to see and do that 5 days was not enough.Well done Hilton Berlin

<Content>Nice modern hotel let down by poor service My husband and I stayed at the Hilton for a long weekend break. We chose it because of the Hilton brand and also the central location of the hotel.The hotel itself is nice and modern. It has all the facilities you would expect from a large hotel chain like the Hilton. Rooms are of a good size and bathrooms are well-equipped (Crabtree  Evelyn toiletries). Our room had a view of the Gendarmenmarkt.It is located in a somewhat quiet part of town and apart from Checkpoint Charlie, you have to take a U-Bahn or bus to get anywhere (unless you're a keen walker). The U-Bahn station is right outside the hotel though, so not a problem.Service however was poor. We arrived at 12pm and were told that our Executive Room wouldn't be ready till 1. That was fine, as their earliest stated check-in time is 2, so we were invited to chill in the Executive Lounge and they offered to look after our luggage until then.Trouble was, the room wasn't ready at 1, or at 2. The staff at the Executive Lounge (when the desk was manned - rare) were unfriendly and a bit difficult. OK, we had to wait. But they cleared away the snacks in the Executive Lounge at 12 and didn't bring out any fresh ones. Then at 2.30 the room was ready, but the luggage got lost in their system and we had to wait another 2 hours for that. So we lost an afternoon of sight-seeing which was a shame.We were supposed to get free water every day and a free newspaper; that never happened. When we complained on check-out, the receptionist unhelpfully said well what do you want me to do about it? Not the sort of service you'd expect from the Hilton. We complained to the manager, who offered to take a miserly 10 euros off the total bill - they needn't have bothered.

<Content>it's where that matters Writing something about a Hilton is not much use really, and I will only do so up to a certain point. Everybody knows what he is going to get here: well-appointed, well-organized, airconditioned dullnes. It must be said though that this hotel does have a history: before the Mauer fell in 1989, it used to be an old DDR-hotel (formerly called Interhotel of course). It was completely overhauled by Hilton, but its anti-capitalist looks still do shine through: the awesome size, the very long, somewhat dreary corridors, the bunkerlike looks, everything points to its former communist existence. The rooms are well appointed, and although the position, on Gendarmenmarkt, with U-Bahn Stadtmitte right in front of the entrance, is magnificent, from your window you will probably have a very dull view of an inner courtyard or so, unless you want to pay an enormous amount of extra money. Having your breakfast on the 1st floor watching the Deutsche Dom (and the French behind it) is awesome, but breakfast itself is rather mediocre. And there are to many people, most of the time. Downstairs, the lobby with its Wintergarten, is magnificent and it still attracts lot of Berliners who take their tea here, or a late afternoon-drink. But it is the strategic position of the hotel which really makes it an attractive place, and which 鈥?by the way - also makes clear how much the (former) western part of the city (round Kurf眉rstendamm) has lost its standing to the eastern part, now called Mitte. Along the Gendarmenmarkt, a formidable, rather Prussian looking square which has come very much to life in the last few years, are - if I am not mistaken - two other hotels (Westin and Dorint, I think) but in a much less nice spot. I have used the Berlin Hilton quite a few times by now - the last time in the end of july 2006, during an extremely hot period - and I can鈥檛 help coming back. Near, or on Gendarmenmarkt, are some good restaurants: Aigner, Lutter und Wegner, Vau, Malatesta and Borchardt. There is a pleasant, but perhaps a bit sleezy nightjoint (Newman) and there are many comfortable streetcafes. You are a 5 minutes walk from Unter den Linden (where in the Zeughaus a beautiful and very worthwhile new museum has just been installed 鈥?Museum fur Deutsche Geschichte, German History, yes) and the Opera. Friedrichstrasse is near too, with Lafayette, and the enormous Dussmann Kulturkaufhaus for books and cd鈥檚. If you want, you can take a walk to Oranienburgerstrasse or Hackescher Markt, where part of the the real nightlife is, and even to the Kulturbrauerei in Prenzlau, which has become a great place, although that will take you half an hour, or a tram from Alexanderplatz. And then you should go to Wannsee of course (S-Bahn 1 or 7), make a walk round the lake, to the Liebermann-Villa, just opened too, or - much worse - to the Wannsee Villa itself, where Hitler and his cronies decied on what they nicely called the Endl枚sung of the Jewish question. If you still feel like eating afterwards you can do so watching the lake, at Seehase, or Sanscouci. History is everywhere in Berlin. And if you don鈥檛 feel like going anywhere at all, it will cost you no trouble at all staying in Berlin for a week without once moving 500 meters away from your hotel (which I have done quite a few times already, and which is nice too).

<Content>below average Hilton We stayed at Hilton Berlin in early June, 2006. We are Diamond HHonor memebers, so were upgraded to executive room on the executive floor. The room is average looking, with motel style bedspread and decrative pillows. underneath the bedspread, there are 2 twin comforters, which is wierd for a queen room. Bathroom is average looking too, with mold smell. concierge not helpful and very unfriendly. executive floor representitives are cold too. we stayed at many hiltons worldwide, we feel this is a below average hilton, especially for it's service. we defintely will try other hotels when we return to berlin next time.

<Content>Excellent hotel, great location I have just returned from a weekend break to Berlin, staying at the Hilton Hotel. We could not have chosen a better hotel for our trip. We had standard rooms, that were very nice. The bed and pillows were so comfortable. The best thing about the beds is the immaculate white bedding including the duvet cover, therefore no reused bedspreads which I really dislike in hotels. The bathroom was sparklingly clean and had everything you could need. The complimentary slippers, robe and rubber duck were a nice touch. We found the staff at reception very pleasant and helpful although the concierge was a bit grumpy. The location is fabulous for sightseeing, you step out of the hotel to face the Deustcher Dom, the square has lovely cafes and restaurants, the U-Bahn is right nearby and the open top bus tour stops a few feet away. We had booked on line through the Hilton Website and had opted for room only, on arrival we were told about the 22 euro breakfast but opted to walk to a lovely nearby cafe and sat outside to enjoy an excellent breakfast for 7 euros. On Sunday we returned for the brunch buffet which I believe is a tradition with Berliners and cost 9 Euros plus drinks- excellent and an experience in itself. If you are on a big stag or hen type do then this is not the hotel for you, it is not rowdy and there is no wild nightlife nearby, but for small groups, families and couples it is perfect.

The bed in my room was as comfortable as any I've slept in in Europe, and the bathroom was very modern and functional, except for the stupid European half glass-thingy in place of a shower curtain. An outstanding choice well worth the money.

<Content>The Executive Floor is Perfect Although the building is not a masterpiece of architecture the Hilton is an excellent choice, especially if you book one of the Executive rooms. Certainly, the Hilton has the best location in town; and from the Executive floor you also have the view of Gendarmenmarkt with the two Cathedrals. The Executive rooms are very large. But the best is the clubroom. There are comfortable seats and sofas in a nice quiet atmosphere. High-quality breakfast is served (included in room rate) as well as cakes, pastries, sandwiches and all kinds of drinks (soft drinks, sparkling wine, white and red wine, liqueurs, spirits) at no extra costs. You may save a whole meal this way or get appetizers. After all, paying for the Executive floor may be an economical decision.I also highly recommend the restaurant Mark Brandenburg: It serves refined regional cuisine made of local products like Havel perch or Brandenburg pork. The Hilton has a typical hotel bar; however I always choose to walk 100 yards to Lutter  Wegner for a late-night drink.

<Content>Excellant Hotel We have just returned from three nights at this hotel and could not fault it. We had an executive room which gave us access to the executive lounge where there were complimentary drinks, cakes during the afternoon and a buffet in the evening. There was also a continental breakfast although we chose to eat in the main restaurant. The breakfast was superb lots of choice and we ate one night in the Fellini Italian restaurant where the food was excellant and good value. The staff were very friendly and not OTT as is often the case in hotels of this rating. Our room was nicely furnished very bright and overlooked the square. I had e-mailed ahead to request this always advisable with any hotel and it has not failed me yet. They also gave my wife a birthday cake and card for her birthday whilst we were there which was a lovely touch. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of checkpoint charlie, the Rechsteig etc and there is a metro station opposite. I would definately recommend this hotel and will certainly return if I ever visted Berlin again. I think the people who made the previous negative comments must have been staying in a different hotel!!!

<Content>Hilton Berlin - It's fine... We stayed at the Hilton for two nights at the beginning of December. The hotel is well place in the city, with a U-Bahn station right outside the door; this makes everywhere very easily accessible. We were also right next to one of the Christmas markets, which was handy. The hotel itself is fine; it is a fairly typical four star hotel, without any features to really set it apart from the rest. The lobby is grand in it's size, and is quite impressive. We were given a smoking room, and the staff were happy to move us to a less smelly non-smoking room when we asked. Throughout the stay the hotel staff were all very helpful and polite, and of course all spoke excellent English - as usual compounding my misery at being uni-lingual!Our room was clean and of a good size and the bathroom was very nice. The minibar was well stocked and priced at the usual OTT rate! The swimming pool and gym were both excellent, although I still cannot quite believe they charge 11 Euros for a Sauna... Breakfast was excellent, with a very good selection of food and very good service. The hotel restaurants looked nice, but we did not try them. Probably my main criticism with the hotel is it's size - the hotel is very big and somewhat impersonal. Checking out at 10.55 on Sunday was not a good plan, as all six queues for reception were enormous - this could of course have been avoided by getting up earlier or doing express check out. The last time we stayed in Berlin (June), we stayed at the Ritz Carlton  paid a similar price to the Hilton; on our next visit we will certainly go back to the Ritz Carlton, as it is that bit more special.

All the facilities are exceelent.Breakfast and other quality of food were very good.I would happily stay here again next time I am in Berlin.The low ratings by some reviewers, I feel reflect personal specific problems they encountered rather that a poor quality hotel.

<Content>Look past the lobby and it's worn  I stayed at the Hilton 22-23 Aug and was disappointed. It looks quite grand from the outside and the lobby sparkles however once you enter the hallways to the rooms it is decorated with gray paneling that you would find in a rustic hotel in the po-dunk USA. The carpets are worn as well in the hallways and chances are slim you'll have a view of anything except neighboring buildings. The paneling carries through to the rooms...although they are nicer than the hallways. One plus was that I was able to check in around 1200 w/no issues. Location is ok, but not great. I e-mailed the hotel before I left to find out what public transport goes to the hotel from the train station and they sent me the directions straight off the internet (driving directions and directions from the airport). Stadmitte metro stop is literally right in front of the hotel. If I go back to Berlin I won't stay at the Hilton. Must put a plug in for Fat Tire Bike Tours though...wonderful way to spend the afternoon/evening.

<Content>Check the Small Print! Booked a room at the Berlin Hilton on expedia uk for my wife and I and our 13 year old son at what looked like a good price of 70 GBP per night. When we checked in they had no record of my son and we had to pay a 40 EUR/ night upgrade charge. Apparently this was 2nd time that had happened that day. When I contacted expedia on return they drew my attention to the confirmation detalils which state room guaranteed for 2 adults. Contact the hotel directly to check availability and charges for extra guests which I had not spotted.Otherwise good hotel, well located in a quiet area. They have a good sized pool although 11 EUR to use the sauna and steamroom is expensive. Didn't seem to be anybody in when we were there.

<Content>Not the usual standard I have stayed in the Hilton Hotel for a number of years and really liked it..We decided to go for the New Year. The room we were given did not have a set of drawers to put our clothes in. The breakfast on new years morning was served in the room where the party was held the night before and stank of stale smoke. As a non smoker this put me off my enjoyment of the usually excellant breakfast.

<Content>Location, location, location Having spend a night at the Hilton in my own hometown, I was was quite satisfied with the hotel. My standard room faced the inner courtyard (you have to pay extra for a room with view on the Gendarmenmarkt, one of Europe's most beautiful squares) and featured a king size bed, chair, desk, a newly remodeled bath room, mini bar, laptop safe - in short: everything you would expect from a Hilton hotel. Room was neither large nor small, but for a stay longer than one night, I would look for a more spacious room category. Furniture was classic, but the grey built-in closets in the hallway clearly reminded of the hotel's opening right after collapse of the GDR. Restaurants and breakfast buffet are top notch. A further clear plus is the hotel's staff which are nice throughout and - of course the unbeatable loation right in the historic centre of Berlin.

<Content>Worn and Noisy  We found it worn and noisy. Is a remodel in the future? Prices reflect what you get. You may be well advised to try another address...

<Content>It's the Hilton After saying on every trip, Well, what do you expect? It's not the Hilton!, it was refreshing to actually stay at a Hilton. We had a big suite for our family of four with a large sitting room and a bedroom. The view was great, the location was great, and the restaurants were very nice. We felt very spoiled and loved it.

<Content>Nice hotel, fantastic location of the ex-EAST Berlin I booked this hotel based on the reviews found on tripadvisor. The hotel is surely at a very good location, has FANTASTIC breakfast (you can't miss it, it lasts from 6:00 a.m. to 11:a.m. !!!), and good amenities.I found the health club inadequate, as well as the massage treatment (she was reaaally soft!) and the room was O.K.The staff at the reception and at the breakfast buffet is excellent, in contrast with the maids who are rather abrupt and inpolite. Who cares? The hotel is good but not as excellent as described... All in all, because we booked it at a terrific price of 150 euro/ night for a double room, it was good.

<Content>Yet another great Hilton German efficieny, we checked in not much more than a minute.The building and facilities are truly lavish and grand, and for a weekend away left us feeling rather spoilt.Our room was of an average size with all the usual facilities and a black and white marble bathroom.Few niggles with the room but they were seen to immediately, and to be honest our stay was enjoyed so much I would prefer not to have mentioned it, but what is the point of this review with out the facts.We managed 2 nights stay overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt with one of us getting an hour long massage. In addition we had a snack or two plus a full dinner at Trader Vic's and plenty of drinks for less than 500 euros all in...Not sure if that is a bargain but is definitely felt like it.
