<Content>Barcelona Football Ok hotel, typical of a big hotel, service ok just... got a twin when checked in even though we requested a double room. had to change rooms, front desk must not read requests. Only stayed one night, did not dine in the hotel. Perfect for location to the Barcelona Football Club - we were going to see a match and that is why we were staying outside the city centre. The pool was great that it was located on the roof top, but was small and therefore 10 British lads hogging the pool having a beer party was quite intimidating, jumping into the pool and drowning all guests around. No supervision of the pool in anyway.

<Content>Don't go unless you're a business person I just got back from this smug self-satisfied hotel today (11/7/08) with a party of great school children who caused no trouble, were well behaved and a joy to be with, yet any time we wanted help, we needed something or asked the hotel to put themselves out slightly, they did nothing but be obstructive. On the first night they'd not even made up some of the pupils beds at 11pm (and these children were 10 years old), one room had broken electrical socket and they just warned the children to not touch it (taking three days to do anything, and then leaving a dangerous pair of scissors). If you're thinking of bringing a school party; don't. They hate children, the British and it seemed everybody in general. This hotel helped put me off ever going to Barcelona again, and they are so dumb that they put 22 children off as well (and these are the sons and daughter of very wealthy people). Short-sighted, rude and arrogant. I hope the place burns down and takes the desk staff with it. That said, the little people (bar staff, cleaners and waiters) were great and tried hard (don't they always).

<Content>What a Fab Hotel What a Fab Hotel.Free mini bar - with soft drinks and 2 bottles of beer - always replaced everyday. We added our own small cans of Amstel - they did not mind - and only 3 Euros for 12 small cans - Bargain.The staff were ace, especially David (Spelt Wrong) the Bald Italian Door man - very good english and supports Man U - lol.Bar area is lovely for a quite drink - food not very good though.We had a family room with a double sofa bed - myself and husband had reclyning beds and 7yr old daughter had the sofa bed just at the side of us - it was a very large room and plenty of room for us all.The rooms are very very clean with little toileteries in the bathroom, shaving kit and comb etc and a small sewing kit in the wardrobe.Free safe box in room too.Very quiet hotel.Only 5 mins walk to Nou Camp, and here you can catch the Tour Bus for around Barcelona and costs 26 Euros for 2 days - saves on taxis and also you can go to the Port too. Saves a fortune and you get to see the city all over.Great food - can recommend Hard Rock Cafe in the centre - brilliant.Only cost us 20 Euros for Taxi from Airport and 25 Euros going back to Airport on the Friday night - takes about 20 mins in a taxi.If you dont mind travelling into the centre and want to be near Football ground - this hotel is perfect.If you want to be near centre - this is not for you.Only problem we found - if you have small children and they need a nap in the afternoon - it is a long way to travel back and then have to pay to go back to the centre again - but older kids will be fine.I would go back and love it - 4 days not enough - jsut as you find your feet and get your bearings it is time to come home.What a place.Loved it.Any questions just ask !!!

<Content>Only if you're wtaching the football.... If you are booking the Senator because you have booked an FC Barcelona game, great. Otherwise, book a hotel closer to the city centre. The hotel is more 3 than 4 star. Be aware there is no air conditioning, only ceiling fans which are noisy when left on all night as the rooms are very hot. The rooms themselves were adequate. The pool on the roof is closed for all of May. Breakfast was a mixed bag. Quite a wait to queue for cooked items (eggs, sausages etc). The plate I picked up had dried egg on it and the glass for my orange, a previous guests lipstick! The cold breakfast buffet was good though. I would definitely avoid the restaurant. The three of us had a 21 euro set menu. Only two of the three starters available and only one of three desserts. To cap it all we had to laugh as the one remaining item became unavailable and myself and a guest opposite were each given a pot of yogurt as dessert. In summary, for the footie it's ideal. For the city, you'll regret it.

<Content>Loved the Senator We booked a week in Barcelona following a serious operation. It was to get away and to relax. The Senator helped us do exactly that. the room was superb, well appointed, clean, large with all modern facilities. The spa was good fun. The pool on the roof was shut unfortunately, as it only opens from May onwards. The food was very good, the breakfast was excellent, great choice of everything and they would cook an 'English' to order. The station at Collblanc was a short ten minute walk away. Getting into the centre took about twenty minutes. That may seem a little remote for some, however, it did give us the peace we wanted. Because of the post op recovery, rather than use tthe metro all the time, we took taxis. They were good and reasonably priced.

<Content>good A few teething problems at start of stay but these were resolved fairly quickly by staff at reception .Good hotel - nice reception area, 4 internet terminals -1euro for 10 mins.Breakfast - had large selection of choice ie breads, ham, cheese, pastries + rolls fruit etc and a chef to cook fresh eggs, omlettes, bacon + sausages also different friut juices + cava wine if wanted.Rooms - alittle on the small side for us ie 2 adult + 1 child but functional - adequate towels soaps etc. provided - mini bar free!! soft drinks + beer + tea + coffee facilitiesRoom service we used twice + the second time we had to send food back as it was cold but this was sorted very quickly.Spa - I thought a little expensive it cost 15euro per adult + 7.50euro per child - but the children were only permitted to use it between 10am - 11.30 am which shortened your day for doing other things.Area - 5mins walk from CAMP NOU well worth a visit even if you are not into football but go early ie 10am as it gets very busy later on. Metro 5mins walk around the corner so very handy for transport to everywhere.Just to the right of collblanc metro station is a hiving area of bustling activity small markets + stalls + good at night.There are also a couple of good fruit shops + cafe bars close byand a hairdressers called EGO - which my mother attended for a cut + blow dry excellant work! Overall a nice stay, good location, nice area, easy access, taxi from airport 30euro.

<Content>My Favorite City on Earth! Upon our arrival we were a little nervous because the hotel seems slightly removed from Barcelona's city center and main attractions. Most of Barcelona's sights are not walking distance from the hotel but the metro is efficient and accessible so it really didn't effect our stay. The hotel concierge was extremely friendly and helpful. They made us dinner reservations and helped us with Flamenco dancing tickets. We called the front desk 15 minutes before we needed to leave for the airport and they called us a cab.The room was quiet and clean. Simple. Room service was on time but the pizza was made with an anchovy-like paste (yuck) and the burger was less than desirable. Stick to restaurants in and about the town!Aqua del Playa (hotel's jacuzzi/indoor pool) is not worth the money. We never ate at the hotel restaurant. There are too many great places in the city...in fact, many great restaurants are in walking distance. Our favorite-Lombardos-is just a few blocks away. We enjoyed Sangria at the hotel bar after long days of trekking around.I am neutral in my recommendation. If you can spend more money then stay at a hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. If this hotel is in your price range then it's a safe bet. Either way, it's impossible not to enjoy such a spectacular city!

<Content>great hotel Just back last night from 5 nights in the Senator Hotel , Cardenal Reig, Barcelona. Nice staff, nice room, ok pool on the roof and a great complimentary mini bar. Breakfasts although an extra well worth checking out. The spa too also an extra was very relaxing. Access to the metro in Collblanc is just a short stroll away. The only problem is the amount of stairs which you need to use which is not conpletely suitable for buggys if travelling on your own with a small child. Overall Barcelona has a lot for the visitor , llovely restaurants, friendly people and lots to do.

<Content>fantastic I am still at this hotel until saturday, Great hotel very clean good staff, The Spa is really different but so relaxing.Food is A1 and plenty of choice.. the free mini bar is stocked each day,Quite a way from the centre but Easy to get in and out use the number 15 bus from over the road or the number 57, The cheapest way is to buy a barcelona travel ticket.Barcelona is fine for single female travellers.... I have had no problems.

<Content>Good hotel for business trip I have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel where we went for a conference nearby. The hotel was a little way out of the centre, I wouldn't stay here if you want to be near the Ramblas etc, having said that it was only a 15 euro cab ride to the top of the ramblas and about 15 minutes on the metro to the Placa de Catalunya. It's very near Camp Nou stadium, and was ideally placed for the Palau de congress where our conference was held.We were very impressed with the hotel. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, good air conditioning, lots of little freebees like a mini bar stocked with fruit juice, beer, water and other soft drinks which was free. Nice tasteful decor and good sized bathroom. Also very quiet. We all slept very well.The food in the hotel was average in the bar, with omlettes and sandwiches etc, not a menu designed to blow you away but not too bad. Breakfast was amazing - a range of pastries, bread, cheeses, serrano ham, tuna, smoked salmon, fruit, even champagne. I don't know how you could have more for breakfast really. We didn't eat here for dinner. The bar staff were friendly and served fabulous cocktails.We didn't go in the spa because it seemed a little too formal, but we spent lots of time on the roof, where there is a lovely little rooftop pool and sun loungers, we really enjoyed being up there. There was no bar though which was a shame, but you could call down and get them to bring drinks up.We thought the service in the hotel was very good indeed, apart from the maids who did the rooms. They were clean enough, but they did things like not give you any loo roll so you had to call down and ask for one (no spares in the bathroom), and didn't restock the free mini bar one day (annoying when you want water) so that was a bit below what you would expect from a 4* hotel.Also, the white cushions on the sun loungers on the roof are so filthy they must be a health hazard and should be destroyed!! If anything needs a good wash, it's those. They coud make a lot more of the roof terrace to be honest, it needed attention but we still enjoyed it.Overall, this was a very 'business' hotel and I would stay here again if I was going to a conference in the area, but I would probably find somewhere a bit more 'holiday' geared if I was coming here for fun.

<Content>Hotel has changed Barcelona: Spa SenatorDate: April 14, 2007Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Liverpool UK We have just returned from 3 nights at this hotel. We stayed there 18 months ago and had a great time. Standards have slipped and we were disappointed for the following reasons.1. Staff in the Spa were arrogant and rude2. Service in the restaurant for dinner was poor e.g. the soup was lukewarm and vegetables for the main course arrived 10 minutes after the steak. Roast potatoes were sliced potatoes covered in cooking oil.3. There were pieces of fusewire on the bed by one of the pillows.4. The return taxi to the airport (organised by the hotel) was 15 euros dearer than the taxi we arrived in.

<Content>great hotel just returned from the spa senator after five great nights there from the 18/01/07. the hotel is really nice,really clean and the staff couldunt be more helpful and pleasent. location is good especially for the fotball fans out there. takes about five/ten mins on the metro from collblanc to the main attractions ie the ramblas and since your not staying on the ramblas the hotel is half the price of similar four stars!only fault myself and my partner found was the breakfast. wasunt upto much. would really recomend the spa in the basement for a relaxing time. if you stay on a weekend check if they have a half price discount on the sunday. they did when we went.if you like tapas there is a lovely little tapas bar/resturant accross the road from the hotel and to the left called bien cafe or somthing similar. freindly staff and reasonable english.you pay about one and a half euros for a bottle of beer there which is cheap.all in all will surely go back to this hotel for a third time.

<Content>Great hotel if you're going to the football. Just returned from a second stay at this good hotel. The proximity to the Camp Nou stadium makes this a winner for anyone going to watch Barcelona play. The rooms are well-appointed, and I found no problems with the staff, who were universally helpful and friendly. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom clean and well set out with shaving equipment, dental kit and usual toiletries, and the minibar was well stocked and free, which is a plus in any hotel. TV has BBC world, CNN and Eurosport in English and there was a stereo CD system.I didn't use the bars or restaurants, so cannot comment. Breakfast was not included in the 鈧?4 charge for the double room.If you use the metro to go to town, go to Collblanc station, about ten minutes walk away along a slight gradient. The hour to travel mentioned elsewhere is a bit generous, but certainly allow 30 minutes. If Barcelona centre is the main purpose for your visit, or if you are of restricted mobility, I would consider another hotel.

<Content>Dont stay here.... We have just returned from a few days at barcelona and stayed in the Spa Senator hotel. The only good thing about the hotel is that it is not far from the airport. If you are over to go to a football match the location is superb but if not do not stay here. It is very very far out from the centre of town about 1 hour to get to the marine or beach. The staff barr one guy were very rude and unhelpful! There is supposed to be free champagne on arrival but it is very well hidden and you have to ask for it - they were not impressed with this request! The decor of the rooms were horrible the walls and ceiling were a sickly colour greeny yellow!! My bed was also broken and creaked really badly everytime i moved. It gradually got worse and worse and i asked twice about getting it fixed and never heard anything about it they just took the details each time i went to reception and said they would look into it - but obviously couldnt be bothered to. There is a good continental style breakfast and they will cook eggs or omelettes but that is all the hot food. After 3 mornings there we saw someone with rashers and asked about them - they had them hidden behind so unless you knew about them you would think there was none. it was the beginning of October when we were there and it was very hot - but there was nowhere to sit outside the whole outside area closes the beginning of October until May so even though the weather was lovely you had nowhere to go to avail of it except to travel an hour or so to get to the beach!!The rudeness of the staff was the biggest off put it just does not put you in good form for your holiday when people are unfriendly.

<Content>No customer service The 4 stars that go along with the hotel are very deceiving. The hotel staff made my stay in Barcelona a terrible experience, not to mention the several items in my room were taken while I was out visiting the city or while I was at breakfast. Even locked items were broken into. I felt unsafe during the rest of my stay at this hotel, and the staff did not offer help or any apologies for all the trouble I encountered.

<Content>Good news hotel Booked the hotel, like the others due to its proximity to the Camp Nou, which was just as well as the journey from Gerona took over three hours.The hotel is literally a 5 minute jog from the stadium and is ideal if you are going to a game.The hotel does seem to have problems with its computers though, as on arrival we were told that they would have to transfer us for a night to another hotel. That said the staff could not have been more apologetic and were very helpful in resolving the issue. They organised a prepaid taxi to take us to the AC Barcelona ( a superior 4 star) and while we waited they provided us with complimentary food and drink. The staff were polite and attentive and certainly not as described. We were given the option of either staying at the AC Barcelona or returning to the Senator (at their cost) - which we did.The rooms, whilst not huge, are very well equipped and comfortable and have a complimentary minibar (softdrinks and beer). The piona bar is large and staff very friendly, although there is not a great atmosphere during the week but hey who is going to sit in the bar when downtown Barca is just a few stops away on the metro! The spa complex is as good as I've seen and worth every penny of the 15 euro it will cost you (but even better when its free on account of the booking hassle.)We stumbled across the restaurant by accident and if you can't find something you like on the buffet you must be a hugely fussy eater. There is every type of salad, cold meats, cheeses, shell fish etc and then the Chef will cook you chicken, fish, pork, pastas, crepes. This is all for under 20 eur a head which to my mind was great value.The location of the hotel is great for the Camp Nou but otherwise there is not much to do nearby. That said the Metro is 5 minutes walk away and with regular trains ( every couple of mins) you are no more than 10 minutes away from Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia, Sangrada. If you want to get a taxi back it will cost about 8 Eur.All in a very good experince and I would definitely stay at the Senator Spa again.

<Content>Handy for the footy.. but you could die of thirst! I stayed at the Hotel Senator with my husband and three teenage children, one of whom is a huge Barca fan. We had tickets for a late season match, which, at the last minute, was scheduled for live TV broadcasting at 10pm. Luckily, the Senator is only a 10-15 minute walk from the Nou Camp stadium and so we would able to walk back home at around midnight on Saturday, instead of crushing into Metro trains or trying to find a cab. For reason of this convenience, I would stay at the Senator again - but not for any other reason.The hotel is clean and smart but the staff do not make guests feel wanted in any way (except for one very pleasant waiter). When we arrived, after a delayed Iberia flight, we waited ages at reception for the one receptionist on duty to finish dealing with another guest. It was still only around 9pm on a Friday evening, so why such meagre staffing? The receptionist told us that our booking had been cancelled by our tour operator (yes, really!!), and that, despite the fact that we had paid for our three-night stay in advance, she could find us rooms for one night only, as the hotel was going to be completely full on the next night...but they would try fo help us find another hotel! So much for choosing a hotel close to the football ground!I found it hard to sleep that night, worrying that I would have to spend the first day of our weekend in Barcelona searching for and moving to another hotel. Judging by the packed flight we had from London, Barcelona was going to be choc-full of tourists for the bank holiday weekend. There was no point in unpacking our cases, and the children kept asking where we were going to go. Anyway, to cut a long story short, after several calls the next morning to Air Miles (with whom I had booked the trip) to try to find out what had gone wrong with the booking, I went down to the reception desk mid-morning to see if the duty manager had an explanation for me, and, hopefully, a solution to my accommodation problem. Yes, he knew all about our problem, but it was all OK; it had been a 'computer error' - on whose part, I don't know - but we would be able to stay for the full three nights after all! It was obviously a great relief to hear that news, but why it hadn't occurred to him to pick up the phone, ring my hotel room, put me out of my misery, and save me a few quid in mobile call charges, I don't know!The Senator's staff shortages are not limited to the reception desk. The piano bar had no pianist and the bar could also do with more staff (the service is very slow). Learning how to smile at guests would do a lot to make them feel more welcome. Apart from all that, the supposedly a la carte restaurant only served basic buffet fare and it costs 鈧?5 to use the spa.

<Content>nice hotel for a break in barcelona we stayed here for 4 nights here last week and were not dissapointed. The hotel is clean with pleasant fountains/water features both outside and inside the hotel. The rooms are a decent size although not massive, but they have some very nice touches like reclining beds, free mini bar (soft drinks and beer) and free use of bathrobes and slippers. The views from our room were just of apartment blocks but pleasant enoughI would recommend the spa which is a great place to relax for a couple of hours. there are several jacuzis/plunge pools and a sauna, and a small indoor pool, large enough to have a swim in.Breakfast was decent with bacon and eggs if you want it (cooked fresh) plus all the usual meats, cheeses and pastries. we had the buffet dinner once in the hotel and this was fine- you get a large salad selection, soup, meat, pasta, sauces, and just go up and get what you want for 20 euros.the hotel's locations is wonderful for visiting the nou-camp,we were lucky enough to get champions league tickets to barcelona v benfica. its just a 15 minute gentle stroll to the stadium. the nou-camp is also the place where you can catch the tourist bus that takes you to all the tourist attractions of the city.the subway is about a 15 minute walk away. really, its quite nice to get away from the busy city centre and come to a pleasant suburban area that the hotel is in.definately recommend this hotel. if you want to be in the middle of everything its probably not for you but if you dont mind staying a bit out of the centre you'll find this a very pleasant hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel but...... Very nice hotel if you are visiting Barcelona for the football. Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights with my 10 year old son. We were there to watch football att Nou Camp and the hotel is excellent located sicne it is only some hundreds meters from the stadium. The only disappointing was that my son was not allowed to visit the spa and pool area. For some very strange reasons you need to be 15 years or more to be allowed in the spa with our without parents?????.

<Content>Fabulous! My wife and I stayed at this hotel on 21/09/2005. We chose the hotel for its location to the Nou Camp stadium - and were not disappointed. It is literally just up the road, approx 600metres. The hotel itself is fabulous, the rooms have a complimentary mini bar that is very well stocked and the beds are very comfortable. I cant write this review and not mention the hotels spa, excellent and very reasonably priced. Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, if you are looking for a very comfortable base in Barcelona.

<Content>Good Hotel Recently returned from a 4 day stay at this hotel. Having stayed at a sister hotel in Madrid I had great expectations of this hotel and these were fulfilled.It is very clean and the staff are friendly. The rooms are compact but includes a good bathroom, large bed, aircon and even a free minibar.The breakfasts are good (but maybe expensive if not included) and again the staff are very helpful.I'm not a health spa type of person so cannot comment on the swimming pool and spa facilities. The reception staff were very good and the bar prices reasonable.The hotel is located a little bit out of the city centre (near the Camp Nou stadium) but the area is quite pleasant and the metro station is only a short walk away near some reasonable eateries and bars. There is also a bus from vertually outside the hotel which goes along Diagonal.A great hotel to stay for both leisure and business.

<Content>Best hotel i've stayed in for ages As a devoted Chelsea fan I chose this hotel as it is very near the Nou Camp stadium the home of FC Barcelona. The rooms are big and clean wth TV with a couple of english speaking channels - sky news - eurosport - bbc news. There is a CD hifi player in every room so take some cd's with you -the rooms are supposed to be sound proof but did not withstand my selection of music ! The beds have electronic recline controls which were a novelty and YES the mini bar is FREE - 2 beers being the only alcoholic drinks the rest are soda's and juice - still what a great touch seeing as hotels charge silly prices for using the mini bar generally - its restocked everyday so if you dont drink everything - hide it !! . The hotel bar shuts at 1AM ( not late enough for visiting Chelsea fans but i digress) and was resonably priced. I ordered room service which was perfectly acceptable and arrived promptly and again not too pricey  its served till 3AM. I didnt go into the spa but it has a massive list of treatments and some funny translations too ! - again very good value - half a day in the sauna , spa , steam room ect without treatments was only 15 Euro's and looked really nice although bizarely one of the hot tubs appears to be full of fruit !!. Staff were excellent throughout my 2 day stay.Breakfast is served 7AM till 11AM and was faultless - you could have bacon  eggs if you wanted something hot or the usual cereal pastries ect - there was even champaigne on ice ( un-opened but i was tempted !!) The hotel is a little out of the main Ramblas area ( i have stayed in the Ramblas before and trust me its nothing special ) but a cab fare to the Ramblas or the Port Olympico comes in at about 8 - 10 Euros( both about 10mins depending on traffic) with the airport at about 15 - 20 Euro's( 15 - 25 mins depending on traffic).Otherwise its about a 5 min walk to the nearest Metro station which is excellent value and reliable If you do end u staying at the Senator and have even the slighest interest in football ( or soccer to my american amigo's) then you simply must take a stadium tour of the Nou Camp - its well worth it. Other general tips would be dont use cafe's or bars on the ramblas but walk down one of the many side streets off of it better selection and cheaper - especially tapas.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and think it is one of the best value places i have stayed in throughout Europe.

<Content>Spanish Treasure Having just spent 14 days cruising the Med.our group of 14 was a little worried that ahotel in Barcelona would be able to compete with the staff onboard ship.What a surprise it was to find a hotel such as the Senator....The place was spotlessthe staff catered to all our needs and the Com Sempre Buffet Restaurant and staffwere magnificent...actually better than magnificent. The food was out of this worldand staff made us feel at home. Our 3 day stay was very enjoyable.You cannot go wrong staying at the Senator in Barcelona!!!

<Content>Great hotel with wonderful spa Very nice hotel with great rooms - very comfortable beds and free mini bar - and a fabulous spa area, access to which costs 15 euros per person and well worth it. Although it is outside central Barcelona by the Nou Camp stadium, cabs are cheap and plentiful - about 8-10 euros each way - and it is close to the route of the tourist bus. We shopped and ate tapas before taking a cab back to the hotel at about 7.30pm and lazed in the spa until it closed at 10.00pm - a very luxurious experience and ideal for a girls weekend. I booked the hotel through Expedia where a double room with breakfast was 拢80 per night. We flew to Girona airport with Ryanair, hired a car (also through Expedia, 拢54.00 for three days) and parked the car under the hotel - very convenient.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Fantastic hotel - great rooms with reclining beds. A bit far from the center of Barcelona, but totally worth the stay. Only 10 minute walk from nearest underground metro station.Breakfast was excellent. Champayne on Arrival and in the lobby for when ever you wanted a glass.Use the Spa for a couple of hours to pamper yourself.A truly wonderful hotel.
