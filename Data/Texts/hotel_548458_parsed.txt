<Content>A Fabulous Little Gem From the moment we walked through the door we knew we were about to experience something special. The room was ready early as we requested and we were jokingly scolded for being a little later than anticipated. Starting off with a good laugh is a good thing.The entire staff was helpful and so friendly. The room (301) was spacious, comfortable and meticulously clean. The location is perfect -- on a residential street, steps away from the hustle and bustle of The Marais and convenient to the Metro. Several affordable cafes are nearby.Be sure and take a map and a business card from the hotel the first time you leave. We were lost in a matter of minutes and had to rely on the kindness of local shopkeepers to help us find our way back.We will definitely be staying here again -- the sooner the better!

<Content>Loved it! We stayed at this hotel at the start of an 8 week trip to France and Italy. There were 3 of us - including a 9 year old child. We had a deluxe suite which was room 402. It was spacious and the extra bed was a fold away but more than fine. The lift only went to level 3 (we were on level 4) so we had to go the rest of the way up the stairs. No big deal and there was always someone on hand for the bags. Check in was easy - we had arrived straight from Oz and they did their best to get our room as quickly as they could. The room was big with a comfortable bed and was well maintained and serviced.Staff at the front desk were very helpful - some were friendlier than others but all were good at dealing with queries.Breakfast was 15 euros and a lot of food. It is arguable that you can go down the street and get what you need for say 7-8 euros, but it was convenient and you won't leave hungry. The three of us had three lumps of baguette, about 7 croissants/pains au chocolat etc, bowl of fruit salad each, cereal, cheese, yoghurt and coffee/tea/hot chocolate. No hot food if that matters. You could easily load up at brekkie then skip lunch and aim for dinner if you wanted to save some money.The location is in the Marais, which is very cool. You do get a better sense of the real Paris as you are not bombarded with tourist traps like in other areas. There are loads of restaurants nearby (within say 10 minutes walk) and also close to shops etc. The nearest metro is about 5 minutes walk.The only disappointing thing about this hotel is its room service. Now you might ask why we bothered with room service given the location but we were tired after the trip and didn't feel like going out! Anyway, it starts at 8pm and the menu has two parts to it. For one, you need to order at least 50 euros worth of food for them to deliver it but they don't combine with the part of the menu. I think they organise it via a couple of local resturants. We ordered some food including a sushi plate for two people for 28 euros. We got about 10 pieces of sushi! It was ridiculous! Best not to bother with the room service and make the effort and go out.This is a small groovy hotel (designed by Christian Lacroix) with a very boutique feel. The staff make the effort to remember your name and room number and it's so much more personal than a larger hotel. The location is convenient and we really enjoyed our stay. We'd definitely stay again!

<Content>Great service at this excellent boutique hotel We only spent one night in this night hotel but we had a fantastic time, Laurent the concierge was excellent and probably the most helpful guy you will ever come across. I asked him about the local galleries on arrival, an hour later he had composed a full list together just for us, he even checked each one so we would know which was open, a lot of art galleries are closed in august for summer holidays. Later in the evening he organised a cabaret night for us at our request, phoning around and go us a great discount too.Its a great boutique hotel in a great location, the room we stayed in had high celings with exposed beams, with lovely french windows, some great period details and lovely wallpapers, the whole hotel was spotlessly clean.

<Content>Wonderful, romantic hotel Spent one night with my wife at this wonderful, charming hotel in Le Marais. It's expensive, but well worth it for a treat. The building has bundles of character and the design has a great, luxury boutique feel. The bathroom was beautiful and the free standing bath was big enough to swim in! Breakfast was served by really friendly, helpful staff and was delicious. The location is great, and there's a really ace looking restaurant opposite, but unfortunately it was closed when we returned to try it! Highly recommended!

<Content>Very cool hotel I needed a place to spend a 1 night layover (business trip) in Paris, and opted for Hotel du Petit Moulin sight unseen (except for the cool website). I had an Executive Room, which was more than enough for my needs. The bathroom was very big by Paris standards. Keep in mind if you aren't familiar with Paris hotels, don't expect a stand up shower. Very cool decor in the room, comfortable bed, etc. I wish I could have stayed longer, and would definitely stay there again. The lobby lounge was nice for a glass of champagne. I did not stick around for breakfast -- had a flight to catch. The immediate 1 block around the hotel is quiet, but the overall neighborhood is a great one, much more authentic and local than staying in a hotel near C-E.

<Content>Let's face it, Parisien hotels are expensive......... Let's face it, Parisien hotels are expensive, especially towards the summer high season. I used to be one who prided myself in finding the value option in town, but I just gave up this time. One goes to Paris to enjoy oneself and to be hedonistic, and the hotel is an integral part of this experience.LocationThe Petit Moulin is in the Marais, near to Republique or Oberkampf stations (for those coming from Gare du Nord). My companion had spent some time in Paris earlier and her favourite area was St. Germain des Pres, but after this trip our favourite is firmly the Marais. Yes it can get unruly and yobbish at night but there are so many lively, young bars in the area as well as trendy clothes shops down Rue Vieille du Temple. Petit Moulin is a 5 minute walk from this world but still away from the craziness at the same time.RoomThe building is quirky and really quite cool. The reception is warm and personal and we were shown our superior room within 5 minutes of arriving. Our room, 203, is in the corner on the second floor with two large windows facing the street. It had a blue theme with blue-tiled bathroom, which was a bit too dark at first but really grew on us. The quirkiness extends to the room - light switches that are totally unpredictable, a strange angular shape to the room. However, we had a most restful night's sleep with excellent sound insulation and good shower to wake us up to the beautiful sight of narrow Parisien streets.The lauded Christian Lacroix design is quite distinctive. The furnishings in the room were very well maintained and everything is cleaned perfectly. Given the obvious cost of maintaining the unique items in the room, everything looks impressively clean and new. Only complaint is of a leaky shower door seal that dripped water onto the bathroom floor.ServiceQuite impeccable. Sure there are not dozens of staff fussing around you, just one very helpful concierge-cum-receptionist who was happy to look up opening times and addresses for us on the internet.OverallThis is not a full-service hotel. You're paying good money to stay in a really fun area in a fun place. Pay 100-150 instead and you might end up with a disappointing, grubby hotel on a noisy street (what happened to us last time) or something further out. I would stay here again, though maybe in the 290 euro room instead (which we stole a peek into), which was brighter and had a nice freestanding bath.

<Content>Absolutely delightful Went to the Hotel du Petit Moulin while in Paris for the first time for our anniversary. We usually skip the chain hotels and try to find boutique hotels whenever we travel, and this hotel was perfectly Paris. The best thing about the hotel by far is its location. In the 3rd arrondissement, a very nice walk to almost everywhere. We didn't have to use the metro or taxi at all, walked everywhere (Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame .. etc). The cafes and bars around the area make it a very pleasant walk or just a relaxing time out. The staff was superb too, they were very helpful in giving directions, suggestion, making reservations, and even changing our room when we first arrived. They gave a decent room at first, but very plain, which defied the whole purpose of going to designer hotel. We asked for something more colorful and unique, and they happily moved us to room 301, which was very interesting (the pictures of the room are found in the traveler photos section). Very clean rooms, friendly staff, excellent location, the only drawback is the size of the room, which is pretty small but manageable. Definitely recommended!

<Content>Will never stay anywhere else in Paris!!! My husband Justin and I, along with members of our wedding party, had the sincere pleasure of staying in the Hotel du Petit Moulin from April 24th through the 27th for our wedding in Paris. Prior to our arrival, the staff was infinitely patient and eagerly accomodating with the many changes we had to make to the reservations for our group. From the first moment of our arrival to our sad departure, we enjoyed truly world class service from the entire staff. In addition to offering us the warmest of welcomes as well as being gracious, polite, and knowledgeable, the hotel staff was made generous and expeditious efforts to meet our every need during our stay. From something as small as negotiating last minute reservations for our large party at top Parisian restaurants, to finding a reputable jeweler at the last minute to size my ring the day before the wedding, the Hotel du Petit Moulin fulfilled our every need and desire. I must offer an extra special thanks to Phillipe, who MIRACULOUSLY found a shop to supply replacement wedding jewelry for me (I realized at the last moment that I'd forgotten mine in the US!) literally a half an hour before our wedding was scheduled to begin. The hotel staff even exceeded our requests and expectations with Herculean efforts such as offering to learn how to handtie a bowtie for my husband and cleaning our room after hours the night of the wedding and adorning the room with rose petals to make our first evening as husband and wife that much more special. In addition to the amazing service, the hotel is GORGEOUS. Its perfectly quaint and artfully decorated. Because we had so many guests staying in the hotel with us, we had the opportunity to view several of the rooms and I can assure you that each one is a design adventure that you will not soon forget. I really cannot say enough about how wonderful our stay was. We will NEVER stay any place else in Paris.

Our room on the 4th floor, under the roof, was really beautiful and so romantic! We loved the cosy and initmate atmosphere of the Parisian bar, which is reserved for the hotel clients. We love the Marais as well, great location for shopping and museums.... Great service by le Petit Moulin A perfect way to end our two weeks in Europe.

<Content>LOVED THE CHICKEN COOP! Hi! My partner Sean and I...a couple of gay guys from Atlanta....stayed here for three days. Being Americans and extreemly poor with the US Dollar so low...we had to settle for the Confort level versus the better rooms on the lower levels. We stayed in room 401, which I affectionately call the Chicken Coop because of all bird cooing we heard out our window. I think the birds were pigeons not chickens though!. The room was nice...but not over the top design wise as we had hoped. It was also very very noisy on Friday and Saturday nights as it is on the top floor facing the street. We are big partiers and stayed out late and had a good bit to drink...but were still a bit bothered by the street noise which seemed to go on until day break on both nights. If you are sensitive to noise and don't have much tolerance for loud drunks....maybe try for a room on the other side of the building. The staff were very very nice and very very helpful. They don't recomend the restauraunt next door, Relais Confort, but we found it to be very good and resonably priced. Also...we were under the impression that their was a bit of a bar crowd at the hotel...but there was nothing going on while we were there. The bar in reality is just a breakfast area where they serve drinks at night. We had an aperos there one night but no one else every joined us. The location is great and not too far from the exciting areas of Le Marais or the Metro stops. We would stay here again but would upgrade to the better rooms. We loved the wallpaper store next door as well, you must check it out!

<Content>love love love it! This hotel is in the best location in Paris- La Marais. To be there on a weekend is to really see Paris. The hotel is small and not entirely user friendly, but it more than makes up for this with beauty, style and location. Designed by Christian LaCroix, each room is uniquely appointed like a piece of art. We were so excited to explore all of the facets of our room--perfect eye candy.Now some of the beauty is not so functional--there was terrible lighting [for you ladies this means that make up application is a pain in the butt] and the only lighting in the bathroom came from an overhead fixture. Also, while there was a big lovely bath tub, there was no shower or shower glass so using the hand held nozzle meant flooding the bathroom. There was also very little space for luggage and/or clothes and even less space for bathroom items, etc. Like virtually every other hotel in Paris, space is limited.Breakfast is not included, but I would suggest heading over to Cafe Charlot and sitting down for brunch with all of the trendy Parisians in the neighborhood--it is not to be missed.Overall, despite its inefficiencies, I still loved this hotel and would absolutely stay there again. Do not underestimate its location--this is the ONLY place I will ever stay in Paris from now on!

<Content>Loved it! We are not normally the type to enjoy boutique / ultra stylish hotels, however I do recommend here for a number of reasons. Our room - an executive room which was large with good bathroom and very cosy bed; and particularly the staff - friendly, good advice and particularly and excellent knowledge of restaurants. For someone whom dislikes the trend of large chain hotels with no atmosphere this is the place to come. The local area is also very interesting with plenty of boutiques and cafes.

<Content>Fantastic all around! We stayed at the Petit Moulin Dec. 26, 07 to Jan. 2, 07. In one of the suites in the attic (the 4th floor). This was a truly wonderful hotel, and we loved our stay. It is charming and exciting. The room was quite large and the bed comfortable. The decor was 100% Christian LaCroix, totally colorful and in-your-face but very tasteful. The location in the Marais was great -- basically between Republique and Centre Pompidou.The service was TRULY phenomenal. Every person at the concierge desk was 100% attentive to our every request. They were extremely professional and very pleasant.If I had to lodge complaints, I would only have two. First, the elevator didn't go all the way to the top (4th) floor. It stopped on the 3rd floor, and we had to climb the very narrow staircase to get to the room. (And with all the wonderful wine France has to offer, that could provide for a dangerous late-night situation.) On the other hand, that was part of the charm.Second, the suite didn't have a stand-up shower. It had a European-style tub with hand shower. And there was no shower-curtain or shower-door, so it made for a rather challenging bathing experience (if you're an American used to stand-up showers). All the rooms, I think, are different. So, some may have stand-up showers.Altogether, we thought it was a pretty good value (for Paris) and a wonderful value.

<Content>surprisingly plain being a big fan of designer hotels, my partner and i were looking forward to our 1 night stay at the hotel du petit moulin in paris. we arrived here after a one night stay at the big OLD four seasons george v and where looking for a whole new and young hotel experiance, being located at the young fashionable Marais and designed by Lacroix himself.when one think of lacroix, you think wild, you think colors, creativity, youth, but when you arrive at petit moulin you are struck by the opposite: very heavy feel and VERY tired looking hotel.the hotel is absolutely TINY no lobby, just a small reception table with 2 sofas. the design has not aged well AT ALL, and looks shabby and ordinery and above all - cheap. we couldnt bilieve it!as we reserved a deluxe room (their most expensive) we were given the key to room 402 on the 4th floor. the elevator only goes to the 3rd floor, so you need to climb the extra floor by stairs, trying to avoid the bags and hoover the cleaning lady has left. not very romantic nor designed i might add.the room itself wasnt so small (it's their biggest) but was nothing like what we expected. cheap wallpapers, worned out carpet and sitting area, plain looking bathroom with no designer twist at all! Did lacroix really had something to do with this hotel? maybe 20 years ago. now its something of a shame for this great designer.the good points were the really nice indian porter (who is also the waiter and the bus boy) and of course the fab location; it is 5 min from the center of Le Marais so if you like to live in this area the location cant be beat.to conclude, i think you can do worse for 350 eur in paris, but just get your expectations right: a too quiet, very small and cold ambiance hotel in a very good location. design? not.

<Content>Hidden in The Marais is this jewel. Discovered where this hotel is listed after we visited it for an escape to Paris.It is a jem of a hotel. Quiet, clean and cool. And the side streets around here are places where you want to get lost. There are also plenty of cool restaurants around and the odd market for your weekend shopping if you've travelled from London and want some provisions for back home.Colourful, comfortable and romantic. You cannot go wrong.

<Content>Witty, stylish and comfortable Although expensive (and way more than we'd normally pay), this is everything I'd want from a Paris hotel. The Petit Moulin manages to combine being super-stylish, witty and incredibly good fun with being comfortable (great beds, lovely duvet, fantastic bathroom, good AC). I worried that all this style might be intimidating but the staff are as friendly and fun as the rooms. And the location - tucked away on a quiet street in the Marais - was perfect. Worth the splurge.

<Content>Rip Off I would have to agree with the earlier review about the Executive Suite. We had a big bathroom with a bathtub, but no shower and no place to put soap etc. while bathing so we were forced into a sitcom mode of trying to reach for the soap, wash hair, reach for the soap. The staff too is a problem--came up quickly with an iron and ironing board and then instead of taking it back, just stashed it in clear sight. Also, the whole charges around WIFI are ridiculous, but this is a a problem in many a Paris hotel. Get with it. We're already paying loads and don't need to pay extra--a lot extra--for WIFI that is essentially free to the hotel. Finally, I've had it with with high priced hotels that also charge 15 E for a breakfast that can be had down the street for 5 E. Okay, I'm done complaining, but I think there ought to be a campaign against WIFI charges and breakfast charges for hotels that are charging more than $300 a room.

<Content>Send the staff to charm school Fantastic location and charming facade - shame about the charmless staff and overrated decor. We paid a higher rate for an executive room hoping for something special - but our 'executive' room was rather ordinary and certainly nothing like the whizzy pictures on the website which motivated us to stay here. If Christian Lacroix designed our room then he's lost his va va voom. The day receptionist was surly, sarcastic and superior - and our welcome to the hotel was pretty cold, despite our valiant attempts to speak French to the staff. If you like warm, honest service don't book this hotel. I'd definitely stay in the Marais again, best location in Paris, but not this hotel.

<Content>Imaginative design, peaceful location Design mavens will revel in this small 'boutique' hotel, well located in a quiet area of the Marais, and just a few minutes' walk from the Mus茅e Picasso, the Place des Vosges and the Metro. The hotel is a conversion of an earlier rooming house and so integrated into the street that it is almost invisible (our taxi driver said we must have a wrong address). The Christian Lacroix designed rooms vary in size, decor and price. Ours was one of the more expensive, essentially red with an all-black bathroom. The ambience is a complete contrast with the conventional cookie-cutter chain hotel. The staff are pleasant and the (French style) breakfast is elegantly presented in the former boulangerie which was amalgamated into the hotel. The only serious irritant for us was lack of an overhead shower. The public space is small and business travellers might feel out of place unless they were designers. Rating: four star minus. This hotel is perhaps not the best choice for Paris first timers but it's an elegant and peaceful haven for the hardened visitor. Recommended for a short stay.

<Content>A wonderful time We had a lovely 2 weeks at Hotel Petit du Moulin. Yes, 2 weeks 鈥?we stayed in the one hotel. With the Australian dollar conversion rates, it was a bit steep 鈥?but compared to other hotels in Paris, it was reasonable value. We had a wonderful time. The trip was for our honeymoon and we wanted something memorable. This was certainly the place.We really enjoyed the breakfasts. After the first breakfast, we thought we could find something cheaper elsewhere than 15 euro each 鈥?but the very next day we were back and had breakfast there everyday. I really miss the breakfasts. If you are looking for a cooked breakfast, look elsewhere 鈥?this is pure Parisian heaven. Freshly squeeze OJ, bread, cheese, fruit salad, yoghurt, croissants, chocolate pain and tea. And all served on delightful Villeroy and Boch china. Just superb. And the staff were so friendly. Every morning we鈥檇 try out a little more of our French on them!The staff in general were very helpful. We read other reviews complaining about the attitude鈥?but can鈥檛 see what all the fuss was about. They were polite, helpful and prompt. What else could you want? If you want people to fall all over you鈥aybe you need to go to a big US-style hotel. We only knew phrase-book French, which we always tried first in conversations and then most people would then continue on in English. It鈥檚 rude to think you can just start speaking in English and expect everyone to follow suit. The front desk staff were particularly helpful when trying to book restaurants for us.After reading previous reviews, we specifically requested the one room with a shower. We thought that 2 weeks grappling with a hand held shower over a bath might be a pain. But of course, I was yearning for a bath every now and then. Plus our European friends told us that hand-held showers are very Parisian. So I really don鈥?think it would鈥檝e been a big deal to have been in one of the other rooms.The design of the hotel was just magical. I was concerned from the photos on the website that it may be too over the top for a 2 week stay and that it could almost be 鈥榟eadache-inducing鈥? But the design was magical. Yes, it was colourful and vibrant but also warn and soothing. Amazing. I guess that is what good design is all about.Our room, I think was relatively sedate, compared to some of the photos of the other rooms. We had the 鈥榖lue room鈥? The room was small as expected. If you had an open suitcase on the floor, you have to walk over it. But that was fine. We knew to expect that. The bed was comfy and the linen and towels just lovely and luxurious. Our room was true to the photos on the hotel鈥檚 website.The Marias area was great as well. Really enjoyed staying in the there. Some people have commented that it wasn鈥檛 in the heart of the Marais. Not sure what they meant by that. We thought it was a good location. Didn鈥檛 really have any problem with street noise, either. Maybe one night, but not worth commenting on. We are so happy that we stayed at Hotel du Petit Moulin for our honeymoon. It was such s memorable and distinctive experience.We would definitely recommend this hotel. If you want a distinctive individual Parisian experience, this is the place. If you want something that is more run of the mill and more 鈥榳hat you are used to鈥? perhaps look elsewhere.

<Content>a bit small for the money i wanted a nice place, a different place to stay in paris whilst on a business trip. the reviews of this hotel, the site and the pics defenitely look very good... but once you get there, you realise that it is all just so miniature. the hotel is more like a doll house, the lobby is no more than 4 meters wide, the library is just an abandoned corner that has been very very tastfully decorated.all in all the feel of the hotel is very pleasant, differently decorated (mix of kitch and chic.. very lacroix, but clearly on a tight budget!), but everythign is cramped. the rooms - i had the executive room at 280 euro- is just very small. i know this is paris, but that;s no reason, after all, 280 euro is no cheap deal.the service was good, nothing exception, but pleasant and courteous. i have not had the chance to have a taste of the 20euro brekkie as i had to leave early and preferred to get a nice fresh croissant at the nearby boulangerie.the area is great! nothign like walking in the marais, fantastic walking routes all the way to the louvre, the ile saint louis, the jewish quarter and the Halles.

<Content>Absolutely Perfect for Travelers......not Tourists! My wife and I returned last night from an 8 night stay at the hotel and it was an absolutely amazing experience. We were in Paris to celebrate her birthday and from the moment we walked thru the door, we felt like everyone working at the hotel was celebrating with us. We were greeted warmly by Phillipe, who gave my wife a Cristian LaCroix key chain, and showed us to our room. We booked a deluxe room on the 3rd floor our first night and it was stylish, well appointed with an amazing bathroom, especially for Europe. When we arrived in our room, we were greeted by a beautiful bouquet of flowers, wine  choclates that my parents had arranged via e-mail thru Phillipe  one of the managers Laurent. It was about the size of a small W Hotel room, so while it was great, we were happy to move to our larger room on the 4th floor for the next 7 nights. We peeked in many rooms  all are different with unique decor, all very interesting. We'll have trouble sleeping at home after experiencing the linens  extremely comfortable beds at the hotel! We are not very good around too many tourists, so the location was absolutely perfect, about 10 minute stroll from the central Marais  just a block or so from a great market street with a slew of great gourmet shops, cafes  a great covered market. We had a group of friends renting an apartment down the street  they joined us for drinks in the great bar one evening. We usually ventured out for pastries  coffees, but did have breakfast at the hotel our last morning  it was well worth the 15 euros.Most of all, we were absolutely thrilled with the way we were treated by the staff. They were charming, professional, accomadating  warm. All of the desk clerks  bartender spoke great english  we were especially happy to see Phillipe's smiling face when we rolled into the lobby after many hours stomping around Paris. Both Olivier  Phillipe helped me secure reservations for my wife  I, along with 6 other traveling companions staying around the city at some great places. Our favorites in the neighborhood were Le Petit Pamphlet, Robert  Louise, and Au Bascou. Phillipe also helped us book a birthday party for 8 of us at Willi's Wine Bar, which was phenomenal.We have found our new home in Paris  will be back again.

<Content>Something different If you are coming to Paris on a budget and want somewhere central and functional to rest your head after a hard day sightseeing, don't stay here. If you want somewhere relaxing, romantic and unintrusive, and don't mind paying the price, then do. We only stayed one night so my wallet wasn't hit too hard, but importantly, I felt I got value for money. We stayed in room 104 which has plenty of room for 2 people and a larger than average bathroom. The room itself was charming and interesting and the bed was the best i have ever slept in. The ambience in the hotel was delightful, from the quirky decor to the aroma in the lift and hallways. We didn't encounter any other guests over our 1-2 day stay and felt we had the place to oursleves. We didn't eat breakfast or use the concierge, so can't comment there, but we had no reason to complain.The location is great as long as you don't mind a 10 minute walk down through the side streets to the centre of marais, place des visges etc.... We found so many wonderful independent shops that we wouldn't have come across otherwise and in the evenings it was peaceful in the street below so we could sleep with the window open. The hotel is also well placed for the bars and cafes on rue Oberkampf, again a 10 minute walk away. I would go back to the petit moulin and would recommend it to those who are looking for something a bit different and not afraid to pay for it.

<Content>Major disappointment Hotel du Petit Moulin should not make your top 3 list when determining where to stay if you want a fabulous, hip and pampered experience in Paris. My partner and I had planned a trip to Paris for Summer 2005 but had to cancel because of my work. To make up for it, we rebooked for September 2006 and decided we were going all out to make up for lost time. Therefore, we changed the original hotel we had planned on staying and decided on Hotel du Petit Moulin based on reviews from TripAdvisor. Let's just say it was a mistake. First, the hotel was way off the beaten path. We both favor hidden gems when we travel but the service, room and experience did not make this hidden hotel a gem. It was not in the center of the Marais as it is portrayed. Nor, was the staff friendly. Nor, was it anywhere near fabulous in regards to amenities. For example, every night we had to call the front desk to request the single iron and ironing board in the hotel. Second, the front desk staff had one gentleman in particular that was terribly rude to us. The first evening we asked his recommendations for dinner and informed him I am a vegetarian. We knew this would be an issue prior to our arrival and had already spent a week in Provence, but I had faired well so far. He scoffed at this and said he only eats beef so he would not know. At that, we headed out and found a big, bustling spot in the middle of the Marais that had plenty of vegetarian options. Lastly, we had also asked about heading out to bars in the area. He informed us that they were mostly gay (which is why we wanted to stay in the Marais in the first place!) and then told us that there's generally no problem with women. This all sounded good until we asked about lesbian bars and that was met with a similar scoff from the vegetarian conversation. If curious, we went to Amnesia which rocks, had a ball and made friends with some wonderful Englishmen.In that price range, we should have stayed at the Luxembourg Parc. Or, like our other friends did and splurge for the George V.

<Content>Truly Parisian I chose to say at this hotel for 2 weeks, before and after my sister's wedding in Paris. She lives nearby and recommended it highly. I do not like large hotels, love to spend time in the marais, and appreciate great service. If not for having to sit down while showering, the stay would have bordered upon perfection. The service here is like nothing a four seasons or ritz can offer. One night after emptying the minibar with friends, around 1am I went to the lobby bar (gorgeous) for more to bring to the small gathering in my room. A pleasant woman left a party there to make my cocktails. I later found that this was the owner of the hotel celebrating the 1 year anniversary of the hotel. Truly fabulous.

<Content>Christian Lacroix鈥檚 Hotel My husband and I were so impressed with Hotel Petit Moulin and we are definately plan to stay there again. I had been researching for hotels in Paris for months before I finally decided to book the Hotel du Petit Moulin. I was torn with going with a hotel in the heart of Paris. We were so happy when we arrived at the hotel. We enjoyed the location very much.The hotel is very clean and the staff is very helpful. You will not be disapointed with your stay at the Hotel du Petit Moulin because c'est fantastic!

<Content>Hotel of Grand Arrogance! I have just returned from a three (3) night stay at the Hotel du Petit Moulin.I have reserved two executive rooms (formerly classified as Junior Suites) at a rate of 280 Euros per night, plus 15 Euros per person for breakfast.Although I paid for executive rooms, I certainly did not receive anything equivalent in service. The luggage was brought to the room by ourselves. The rooms were not turned down for the night -apparently this service is not provided.....Considering the pleasant area of Marais, these minor details were not troublesome, until on the third day of our stay -a Sunday-, we returned after lunch to find that one of the rooms was not cleaned and prepared at 15:50! When I complained to the director/manager about this, she thought that I was unreasonable, did not apologise and in fact, attacked me verbally about my expectations. Worse of all, she involved in the discussion the chamber-maid, who failed to clean the room -for the record the hotel has only17 rooms. Her manner was utterly unprofessional and the worst I have encountered in my very long experience as a frequent business traveller. In addition, I was informed that soap and shower gel are provided upon the client's request, as ours were not renewed in three days.This exchange trully destroyed this short vacation, which was a birthday celebration. When I requested that evening, a late check-out (at 14:00), I was told at the reception that this will not be a problem. On the morning of our departure, another receptionist informed that a late check-out was not possible, because the hotel was fully booked. Two minutes later, while still standing at the reception, he offered over the phone a room for that night to new customer! When I confronted him about being inconsistent -I am a fluent speaker of the French language- I was informed that I should not expect any privelleges for the executive rooms. All rooms, I quote are the same. That is, except for the price, as I was charged a premium of 280 Euros!Overall, the area of Marais is wonderful -and has always been-, regardless of boutique hotels. Christian Lacroix is an accomplished designed and an acquired taste. As an interior designer, he is certainly different.However, the attitude, arrongance and sheer lack of curtesy at the Hotel du Petit Moulin, make this small establishment, a hotel to avoid. In paricular, its ill-manered, vindictive -female- manager. Holidays are not only made special by beautiful rooms/hotels, but importantly by welcoming and hospitable people. And that you will not find at the Hotel du Petit Moulin!

<Content>Paris Charm This is a nice, comfortable en lovely hotel. Indeed it is a small hotel with small rooms but the design  decoration are a great compensation. My wife and I spend there three nights. Breakfast is excellent. Also the reception is very helpfull. If you look for Paris charm this is it.
