<Content>Unfortunate hotel experience. Don't waste our time! First let me say that the hospitality of the front desk ladies was FABULOUS. They were honest and accommodating and tried their best to make us comfortable. So kudos to Ms. T and the ladies at the FQCH.Now here's the lowdown: We were given a tour of all the available rooms so we could choose which one we'd like to stay in (which was nice--Thanks T). The room we chose had been recently renovated, but for some reason the water had only 1 temperature--SCALDING! The next room had only cold water and reeked of smoke. The final room had a hole in the glass of the door, the sitting area had 2 arm chairs, a coffee table and an amoire with a TV in it (which didn't work) as well as rope-sized furry cobwebs in the rafters. There was a hint of smokiness but at least the water got lukewarm so we could shower--even though the shower curtain was covered in mold stains. Unbelievable. I understand that the hotel in under new ownership and they are in the midst of renovating--at a snail's pace. The renovations they have made are mediocre. Their website says that every room has a hair drier and that breakfast is offered. No driers in any of our 3 rooms and the staff informed us that they haven't offered breakfast for months.So our suggestion, walk out the front door of the hotel and stand facing out in N. Rampart. Look to your right across the street about a block down. You'll see flags flying. This is a sign of hope. This became our savior. Down a block or so on N.Rampart is the Best Western French Quarter Landmark Hotel. For $10 more per night we had a clean room with a working TV, hair drier, coffee maker and plenty of room to relax. To top it all off they have a complimentary continental breakfast. We checked out of the FQCH that morning. The ladies were very understanding and canceled the rest of our stay without penalty--were informed prior that we'd be charged 1 night for canceling on such short notice. We walked on down and checked into the Best Western. It was a GREAT feeling. Never thought I'd be so happy to stay at a Best Western. I highly recommend the Best Western on N. Rampart. Great value, warm hospitality and a safe, comfortable night's stay.

<Content>Make sure you got your tetanus shot. This hotel needs a lot of work. While the desk people were very nice, our room was dirty. The blankets had cigarette-burned holes all over them, not to mention that the sink and towel caddy in the bathroom were so rusty that they would leave orange marks on anything you left on them. Hairs in the tub.. Our television's remote did not work and our mattress was as hard as a rock.There is a pool at this hotel, which was filthy. The pool furniture lining it were also badly rusted. Also very off putting: There are two maintenance men who wander the property, neither of which look all that friendly. By their attire, you might think they're homeless. It wasn't until I saw one of them with a wrench to fix our next door neighbor's shower that I understood that they worked for the hotel. This hotel is in a very rough neighborhood. We didn't have any trouble walking back and forth (at night) during our stay, but if you have the opportunity to stay somewhere else.. stay somewhere else!

<Content>The Htel from Hell Booked via United Airlines websiteon Airline Net work .co.UK on Jan 10 2008.With reference to my phone call about my stay at French Quarter Courtyard in New Orleans booked and prepaid via yourselves on Jan30 from the United Airlines web site. I am demanding all my money refunded for the following reasons. The hotel looks and sounds like Courtyard by Marriot. In reality it was probably the worse hotel in 37 years of world wide travel !!!! Just imagine arriving in New Orleans after 14 hours from leaving home to be shown to room 201 at French Quarter Courtyard on 1101 Rampart Street  The room was dirty , the bathroom was dirty and both the TV and phone did not work. There was no window curtains so two hours after falling asleep I was woken up by the glare of two neon street lights and road noise. The room was at the front of the hotel facing the busy dual lane road and the noise was continuous. The following morning, no hot water meant a cold shower and the towels were all stained. Breakfast was also poor due to cold coffee and sliced bread to be toasted by myself and certainly not anything worth paying for as shown on your confirmation order !! I asked the room clerk to change my room  I was allocated room 206, the ceiling had wall paper hanging down ( the significance of this comes later.) but at least the room was in the quieter Courtyard area. The TV did not work due to the On/Off button being removed, no phone in the room and again a filthy bathroom.The bed was clean and comfortable however worst was to follow. On Sunday night a huge thunderstorm woke me up at 2am and suddenly cascading through the ceiling was water ( much faster than the shower!!) I bailled furiously using the ice bucket which filled in 10 seconds and I ran outside and grabbed the maids pail that had been left for 3 days outside my room to alternate the bailing process Happily the storm passed but not until several gallons of water had been thrown over into the Courtyard below. I complained to the front desk manager (Ms Rose Molere) and said I wanted to speak to the manager Mr Jerry Innella Finally it was agreed prior to my departure at 2.30 pm on the 6th March we could meet.I was told by Rose that I was the (--------)trouble maker by this clerk not really the way to treat a paying guest and the manager would meet with me !! Mr Jerry Innella discussed with me and It was agreed in writing that as he had not been paid by your organisation yet he would only bill you for two nights at the regular room rate of US $89 per night. He and I signed this agreement and I left town to return to the UK.

<Content>Do Not Stay In This Hotel!!!!!!!!!!! When I arrived they gave me a room and it was completely dirty, there were a lot of hairs in all the bathroom and in the sheet too. I went to the front door and I asked them to change me for the other room immediately. They changed me but the problems were the same. When you arrive you must pay U$6 for Internet, telephone and breakfast, but the telephone did not work, the signal from the internet was horrible and the breakfast was a joke. The next day I found another hotel to stay. It was impossible to stay.

<Content>Great Hotel!!! First off the front desk was a little unorganized but the place was the perfect price for traveling on a budget. Not to mention inexpensive parking which is key in new orleans! Parking was also very guarded so you dont have to worry about your vehicle getting broken into. The hotel itself was gorgeous! The rooms were classic new orleans style which was wonderful and the pool view was fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel. Any review on here that might be bad had to have been coming from someone with extremely high standards, oh and you pet lovers, this hotel is pet friendly.

<Content>Beware of Scam - Extra Charges on Arrival We booked two rooms at this hotel for a Saturday night. Upon arrival my wife was asked to pay $13.90 fee for 鈥渁menities鈥? We had already for the hotel in full through Expedia. I asked the attendant what the charge was for and she broke it down to a mandatory Breakfast, Phone, and Wireless Internet fee. I explained to her that breakfast was already included in our charges and asked to speak to the manager. After arguing with the manager she reduced the charge by six dollars, removing the breakfast fee. After paying the fee my wife asked if the rooms were NON-SMOKING as we had booked them, the lady confirmed. When checking into the rooms I found that one of the rooms didn鈥檛 even have a telephone, only the cable where a phone should be plugged in (amenity fee for phone?), I also found that my 鈥淣ON-SMOKING鈥?room was heavily smoked in. The rooms were dirty, the floor was not clean, the mattresses and pillows looked like they had been used as river rafts. The ceiling fans had enough dust to grow crops in. The bathrooms were the only thing that was clean, and we did have enough clean towels. FREE PARKING WHILE SPACES LAST - I heard late afternoon quests complaining about not being able to park so I ended up using a cab to ensure I had an overnight parking place. There were no signs of security or cameras in the parking lot, and the gates remained open all night to a horrible neighborhood. The hotel has some arrangement for a homeless person living downstairs amongst the regular guests. I have no problem helping homeless, but they should help him by renting an apartment, not mixing them with tourists. All-in-all this hotel is one of the worst I have ever stayed in. I think $29-$39 a night would be a fair rate for this 1-2 star hotel.

<Content>Most Horrific Hotel Experience of My Life! I previously stayed at this property in 2005, and what I found when I came back two years later was an absolute and utter disappointment. The hotel itself is lovely, the pool being its best feature, and the staff are still mostly very nice, but it is clear that the current management is very poorly running this establishment. The cleanliness of this hotel is non-existent. You basically have to ask for anything you run out of, including clean towels, and we did not have our sheets washed once while we were there. The hotel booked a huge party on a Saturday night in the courtyard, and we had to go out that night for hours because we couldn't even hear the television in our room over the yelling and loud music in our hallway. The remote control was broken, and the so called amenities that we payed a fee for per night on top of the hotel room rate were a joke. There was no wireless internet access as promised in this list of amenities, and we were informed by a couple of locals staying there that it had in fact never been functional. On top of this, we were harassed on our morning of check-out by a staff member who threatened to call the cops on us if we didn't get out merely five minutes after our official check out time. She called us multiple times even after I assured her that we were packing and on our way out as soon as possible, and then she came to our hall to pound on the door and yelled at the rest of the hall to Get out, get out, or I'll call the cops. We never disturbed anyone while we were there, we kept the room very clean, and we payed for everything in advance, so there was absolutely no reason why we should have been treated this way. I am sad that such a beautiful property has obviously fallen into the wrong hands, but I can never go back to this hotel again.

<Content>worst service ever!! DO NOT STAY HERE!! It may be the cheapest hotel in New Orleans, but you get what you pay for. I read the reviews before I booked but I didn't think it could possibly be that bad so I took a chance. Overall, the hotel was decent but the service is worse than anything I have ever experienced. They only gave us one towel in our room and no washclothes or handsoaps. When we asked for another towel the staff looked at us like we were trying to steal them and gave us the run around on who to see about it...we never got the towel. Also, the website specifically states deluxe complimentary continental breakfast which is one reason we chose the hotel to begin with. We pre-paid for our room, but when we arrived we were told that there would be an additional $6.95 a day fee for the breakfast. When I mentioned the website the lady told us that it was mandatory if we wanted our room key unless we had a print out proving that's what it said. So, I sucked it up and signed the paper. We woke up at 7am every morning for breakfast only to see a toaster and a bag of bread. Once again, when I asked the front desk she looked at me like I was crazy and told me that's all they had. At checkout we complained and said we weren't going to pay the $40 plus for something we didn't receive. She dismissed me and gave me the number to management. After arguing with the owner he finally agreed not to charge me for the deluxe continental breakfast and hung up on me!! Then over a month later, I received my credit card statement with the charges!!! My stay in New Orleans was great but all the stress of dealing with this hotel has made it not worth it. I will never stay here again!

<Content>Not at all like the Website!! Steer Clear Not like the webiste. This hotel was not quaint at all. The only good thing going for it was the price, it was cheap but I suggest you spend the extra $20 and stay someplace else. The room was large and not very clean. You can see that the walls needed a coat of paint or a good washing. Our balcony joined another room and the door would not lock properly so we had to wedge a chair under to knob to feel remotely secure. The Hotel bar technically had 3 types of beer but they only stocked one. I requested a gin/tonic and they had no tonic. Then I asked for a rum and coke and they had no rum...thats when i just got a beer. The staff are friendly once you start asking questions but they don't seem to volunteer too much info unless asked. The hotel was within walking distance to burbon street but you have walk over three blocks to a well lit street to walk there. Its not safe to walk on the darker streets around the hotel at night. Hotels in New Orleans are pretty cheap right now so I would suggest you continue looking elsewhere for a better deal.

<Content>Not a bad pllace to stay We needed a fairly inexpensive place near the Quarter and found the Courtyard. We arrived not knowing what to expect. While it was not luxurious it was clean, the pool/courtyard area were fantastic and easy to get to, and the staff was friendly and bent over backwards to help make our stay enjoyable. No matter where your room is, you are close to street level and traffic could be noisy at night. The continental breakfast was small, but it was available all morning long and the coffee was great! While it's not the Ritz, it's not a bad place to stay.

<Content>Roach Motel This hotel was horrible. The furniture was busted. My boyfriend and I joke about the three-posted bed and the leaning desk. He slept fully clothed. There was only one towel in the dirty bathroom. I tried to find a tourism channel on the television but the remote control was broken. Not that it mattered, there were only ten channels. So I requested a different room, but unfortunately, they were all just as dilapidated. I cancelled my reservation for the next night immediately and booked us into a four-star hotel for $30 more. It was so worth it. I recommend that you keep looking. There are so many wonderful hotels and BBs in NOLA.

<Content>muah. we had stayed here years ago and decided to go back. that was a mistake. it has obviously changed hands a few times since then. there were 4 of us and we paid for a room with two double beds. we went upstairs and found a room with one double bed. we lugged all our stuff back downstairs and told them about their mistake. they said 'oops, we are out of rooms'. everywhere else was booked or too expensive, so two of us had to sleep on their hardwood floors. nice. that night we noticed that their air conditioner did not work. we called the fron desk and were told that they would fix it the next day. they didnt. the television did not work either. i guess being in new orleans no tv is not such a big deal. but it would have been nice to nod off to late at night while trying to fall asleep on the dirty hardwood floors. no one bothered to try and help us out at all. it was pretty awful.

<Content>Nice property for the price The French Quarter Courtyard Hotel is a decent property for the price. The Ritz it isn't but then again I paid about 65 a night.My room was large and for the most part clean. They need to do a better job of cleaning the floor, an old toothpaste tube and cap stayed there the three nights I was there but everything else was fine-no dust on the furniture, bed was made etc.. The room been freshly painted and the furniture looked new. The airconditioner worked well. The shower also gave a decent amount of water. Had recently stayed in a better rated property and had very little pressure, here at least was fine. Be warned of one thing, some of the rooms have the temp control in the wrong direction, so I waited a long time for hot water. Once I figured it out it was fine and plentiful.The courtyard was well kept and the pool was wonderful. The continental breakfast was almost non-existent however. Coffee and a bagel(if any left) one morning a pre pack donut. Again if I paid more, I would not be happy but for the price it was better than nothing. Note to management, please keep the breakfast-I heard you were considering doing away with it, even if it is small it beats finding someplace to eat first thing in the morning.While the area is not the best, I never felt afraid or threatened when walking the area, and I walked back after 1 AM. If driving being on the fringe of the Quarteris better than staying in it.The staff was friendly and helpful when needed.This property would rank higher with a little more attention to detail, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again and recomment it to others.

<Content>Excellent for party people on a budget! I went to Mardi Gras 2003 and stayed at FQC. I was a senior in college and for my needs it was great. It's clean enough, within walking distance to Bourbon St., and fairly cheap. Would not recommend this hotel to families, or older people due to the location (Rampart rd.-kinda seedy) The hotel has kind of its own flavor, and is a real New Orleans experiance.

<Content>Our Hotel Stay Was Far From Easy In The Big Easy We arrived in New Orleans very excited for the 2005 Essence Festival. It was our first time to the Big Easy so we could not wait to start the experience. However, when we arrived at our hotel the nightmare unfolded. The French Quarter Courtyard was a far fetch from the printed material mailed out to us and the self submitted descriptions on the internet. Checking in was delayed due to housekeeping not cleaning the rooms in a timely manner. Check - in time was 3pm and we didn't get into our room until after 4pm. Upon entering our room we were taken aback to see the poster bed foot post broken. The bathroom was not clean and there was no iron. Unfortunately, during this weekend they were sold out (along with the rest of New Orleans), so changing rooms was not an option. Calling the front desk to request needed amenities was a waste of time. The normal amenities you would find in a hotel room were not apart of this hotels amenities list. We had to sign the iron in and out every time we needed to use it. We requested towels and were rudely told the towels and linen were all dirty. When questioning the broken bed posts we were told that most of the rooms were like that and management didn鈥檛 see the need in improving due to the fact that they have been sold out since April with no complaints. We were astounded to learn that we were staying at a hotel whose priority was not to provide their guest with adequate room accommodations. Going to get ice from the broken ice machine was a complete headache. When asking the night auditor to provide me with some ice from behind the bar, she sucked her teeth and told me I can't give you a whole lot. after filling the bucket a 1/4 of the way she rolled her eyes and shoved the bucket back in my direction. By the end of the night we had enough and requested a manager. We were told that the manager was off premises and if we needed to speak to her to contact her on Tuesday, July 5th when she returns. We then asked who was in charge while she was off premises the reply was no one. We insisted on getting in touch with her because we wanted to resolve our issues before we left on Monday July 4th. Again we were rebutted. We decided to take our concerns to the owners, but was surprised when we were refused that information. For the next two days the chaos continued. At check-out we decided not to pay for our stay until we got to speak to a manager or owner. Within the next 5 min a miracle occurred, the manager's cell phone number appeared and she was on the phone waiting to speak to us. At that point we just walked out. If our concerns were not important enough to call the manager when we requested to have our issues addressed then getting payment at checkout was just as insignificant. My advice to anyone visiting an unfamiliar city is to do extensive research on the hotels of interest. The French quarter courtyard, which is not even in the French Quarter, gets a terrible rating for careless management, horrible service, and overall atrocious conditions of the hotel room.

<Content>French Quarter Courtyard could be so charming, but... My family and I (husband, two daughters, son-in-law, grandson, and mother-in-law) stayed at this quaint hotel for 5 nights in late June. I keep visualizing what a lovely place it could be if it were a little cleaner! The window ledges and corners of the rooms were just full of dust! We had to wait for clean washcloths each day... apparently they were short on them and had to wash a load before they could be replenished! The staff seemed pretty apathetic and not too friendly, except for the two cleaning staff on the 2nd floor (Lisa and a male staff member). Head housekeeper moved so slowly and seemed to just carry and towel and talk all day!Beds were comfortable, AC worked very well, and we had plenty of hot water. My daughters' room however did not have good hot water, the TV volume could not be turned down, and the remote did not work. They reported the TV problem on the first day, but it was never taken care of. Also, their TV was located in a sitting room as you entered, but was not visible from the bedroom. My youngest daughter stepped on 2 huge NOLA cockroaches on their floor and they even found one in their bed. We saw none on the 2nd floor, though. The night before we left, there were three very loud men in the room above my daughter's room. They were yelling and carrying on all night! We even heard them in our room, which was on an adjoining wing! They reported it to the desk staff who said they would come up and take care of it, however nothing was done and noise continued until dawn.Continental breakfast was packaged muffins, Danish, corn flakes or raisin bran, and orange juice. This was served each day without any variation. There was alway plenty of good coffee 'round the clock, though!The best feature of this hotel was its beautiful courtyard pool! It was very clean and refreshing. Balcony above gave a lovely view in early morning or late at night. Overall, our experience was ok, but again, I can just picture this place as a sparkling clean environment and imagine how much nicer it could be!

<Content>A Nightmare We made reservations a month before. Upon arriving on June 5, we were told there was no room for us. When we confronted them with our confirmation number they just said there was no room for us. We found ourselves in a strange city with no hotel and with scarce availability in other hotels. Then they charged us for a one-night reservation and we had to spend time and effort in contesting the charges!

<Content>BEWARE!!! A reservation nightmare!! Upon arrival on May 27th, we were told that they didn't have our reservation. I showed them a print out of the internet confirmation. The deskperson asked how I booked it. I told them I went directly into their site and made the reservations. She didn't really care and wasn't willing to help us out. When I asked about talking to a manager, the deskperson said one was not on site. She also said that if there was one he/she couldn't help anyway. This was our first time in New Orleans and it almost got ruined because of this problem. You'd think they would feel horrible and try to call around for available rooms somewhere else. Not a chance. We pretty much got thrown out on the street. I honestly believe that they gave our room to someone else willing to pay more. We had made the reservations three months earlier and got a really good price. Guess they wanted to make more $$. I think it was a blessing in disguise that we didn't get to stay there. As we were waiting to check-in, another customer was waiting in line to complain about the non working air conditioning. From the sounds of the other reviews, non-working AC was the least of the problems. By the way, this hotel is next to pretty shady tattoo parlor!! Stay away unless you want to have a hell vacation. I wouldn't stay there for free!! Absolutely horrible customer servicee. Go next door to the French Quarter Suites instead. It's more, but worth it. The deskperson Velda is the best.

<Content>You get what you pay for.... I stayed at the FQCY hotel in April. I was on a budget for the trip...but would have gladly spent a few extra dollars to upgrade to a nicer hotel. The clientele was shady at best. The rooms were cute but the sheets never really seemed clean and the bathroom was disgusting! The one good thing...the staff. They were very nice polite people. I would praise these people over and over again, but I would not recommend staying at the adult hostel (the nickname for the hotel for the week) again.

<Content>Had a great memorable stay I only looked at the reviews once I got back and was surprised to see there were bad reviews. I spent $80 for a one night stay and felt like I was truly transported to old New Orleans. The room was defnitely NOT modern. It has all the antique furnishings of a room from long ago in New Orleans. Four post bed. Old ceiling fan. Slat styled shutters. The room was comfortable and I didn't hear much streeet noise (as one person mentioned) since I stayed in a room facing the great courtyard. It does get a little hot in the room at night. The pool in the courtyard was amazing and comfortable. Perfect for taking a midnight swim in New Orlean's hot weather. They have a bar in the lobby which is a blast given there are tons of people there to hang out with. My only complaint was the staff could have been a little friendlier during the day time. But the night staff were really cool.

<Content>Not Bad We were concerned about this hotel from all the negative reviews we read about on this site. Lets just say we were pleasantly surprised. It could have been a little cleaner, our room was ok, small and bathroom needed some updating. Staff was very pleasant, pool needed a good cleaning. The location was great and within walking distance of everything, we felt very safe. Not a bad place to stay at all. It was quiet this past weekend, even though it was Jazz Fess, most people at the hotel were in the 40-60 range, much quieter than I had thought it would be.

<Content>Stay away!!! After some searching on the web, I came across this hotel. From the look of the site it seemed decent. The price wasn't bad and the location seemed to be ideal. When I arrived at the hotel I instantly noticed that it was right beside a very busy street. With that in mind I was hoping to have a quiet room, but they put me in a room that was right beside the street, not cool. The walls are so thin I could hear people talking out on the street and in the room adjacent to me.The room didn't seem very clean and its size was laughable. The ceiling fan sounded like it was going to fall any second. They didn't give us enough towels or washcloths and we had to continue to ask for them throughout the stay. And the bathroom, wow, lets just say that it was not good. When I went to take my morning shower, I found out that the water temperature had a mind of its own. It would go from extremly hot to way too cold in a mater of 3 seconds.The walk to Burbon street wasn't only long, but it was dangerous. I know Burbon street isn't the safest place, but I seemed safer there then on the walk back at night. It got worse the closer we got to the hotel.The courtyard looks alright, but its not really a place to swim or even relax. The recliners we're all steel and no padding. No comfort at all.All I can say is stay away. I know it looks cheap, but you get what you pay for. Stay at your own risk!

<Content>You get what you pay for This place is cheap and seems to attract spring breakers, students etc. When I stayed there there was a lot of noise late at night from drunk residents etc, also a lot of noise from the road. It was a Saturday night so a lot of police sirens from the road too.Value for money is important to me but this is a bit too cheap.

<Content>Louisiana charm... Was very leary of my stay here having read some of the reviews on this website. But I am glad to say they are unfounded. The place was very nice. Rose at the Front desk made our stay very enjoyable. Would definitely stay here again. The price was very economical which allowed for expenditures out on Bourbon!

<Content>Quaint but needs improvement First off, I must say that the French Quarter Courtyard Hotel has a lovely courtyard. The room could have been cleaner with some dusting of the lovely ceiling beams and a little vacuming behind the TV and the corners. Some paint would have helped the woodwork to cover some ugly spots! Knowing that mildew is a problem in New Orleans I wasn't surprised at the bathroom. This could be fixed with new caulking around the tub and again some corner cleaning would be very beneficial. The room servicing was almost non-existent but the trash cans were emptied daily. We had to ask for a coffee packet two of the 4 mornings we were there. The Continental breakfast was average and the bar staff was very friendly. I could not say this for the front desk staff. The furniture was sagging or broken (bed posts) and our room was minus a chair which made it somehwhat uncomfortable to watch the news. Across the side street there was a bright pink building known as the New Orleans Guest House. It was perfectly lovely and we found out that their rates were $69.00 and $79.00 per night with free parking. Next time we will stay there. A lovely courtyard and beautifully antiqued furnished rooms.

<Content>It's okay We booked this hotel through a vacation package deal after reading reviews on TripAdvisor and I think the various experiences documented on TripAdvisor from really good to really bad accurately represent our experiences. For this hotel, go with the expectation that you may get a decent room or you may not. The employees of the hotel were friendly enough and as helpful as they could be under the circumstances. For example, the front desk clerk also doubles as the bartender (note that the bar is open 24/7). If the clerk is tied up, the drinks have to wait! The hotel appearance is quaint and appears to have undergone some freshening up with paint. Our group booked 7 rooms and each room was different as far as cleanliness and upkeep. For example, our room could have been very cute -- it included a fireplace, a sitting area, a four poster bed, and hardwood floors. A little maintenance, upkeep and more attention to the detail cleaning would make the room worth the nightly rate. (For example, 2 of the posters on the 4 poster bed were broken and the chairs in the sitting area were torn and pretty ragged.) The cleanliness of the hotel overall was mediocre at best; however, I was glad that our bathroom was clean. There was a swimming pool -- it needed a decent cleaning.The location of the hotel to Bourbon Street was within a reasonable walking distance. Not sure that I would attempt to walk alone in the dark, but with a group it was fine. (Ten minutes at the most.)The bottom line . . . If you're looking for the best price for a place to shower and sleep, a location within walking distance (with a group) to Bourbon Street, and you don't mind the fact that the hotel could use some TLC, you'll be okay staying here. If you're looking for a romantic getaway or a hotel that is in the above average or excellent category, keep looking.

<Content>Charming I was a little wary reading some of the reviews here before i arrived. I'm glad to say that it was totally unfounded. I stayed in the back cabin, noise was minimalistic at worst. The room was clean and the bed was big enough for this 6'4 guy. It is close enough to some really great clubs and places to eat, helped you experience some of the less touristy parts of the French Quarter. I'd stay here again in a sec.

<Content>Absolutely the worst hotel ever I booked a stay at the French Quarter Courtyard through the Orbitz website. This hotel was recommended as an Orbitz Super Saver best-buy option on the website. It was also listed as 3 stars. At best this hotel is deserving of 1/2 star (as it is just barely better than sleeping on the street). Upon check-in we (my girlfriend and I) discovered that the room was not habitable. We spent less than 5 minutes in the room, just long enough to use the phone book to book a room at the Double Tree Hotel. Here is a summary of what was wrong with the room.- Holes in the floor (old building with wooden slats floors).- Stained sheets and blankets.- The door to the room was a French door (basically a large see-through pane of glass covered by only a see-through piece of lace). The door faced the Courtyard and anyone outside could easily see into the room.- The bed had 4 posts, one of which was at a 45 degree angle.- Picture frames were crooked, cracked and broken.- The bathroom shower was a tiny, tile stall that was completely covered in dark, black mold and mildew.

<Content>Best Bargain Around! I thought that this hotel was lovely, especially for the price. My room was clean and very pretty. It had brick floors, high ceilings, and faced out onto the courtyard and pool (with fountains!). While it鈥檚 located just outside of the French Quarter, it was a quick walk (less than ten minutes) to the action. Some of the houses that you walk past look a bit shady but were not, in my opinion, dangerous. I walked to and from the French Quarter three or four times by myself (a woman in my mid-twenties) and felt about as safe as I would in any city. I loved the feel of the place, and found the staff to be very friendly and courteous. My only problem with the French Quarter Courtyard, and I would guess that this is not unique to this hotel, is that courtyards are very echoey. At night I could hear people walking around as their footsteps echoed off of the walls. Most hotels and inns in New Orleans have courtyards, but this wasn鈥檛 something that I had anticipated. So, my advice to light sleepers or single women travelling alone, you may be better off with a room on the second floor facing the street, at least traffic noises are predictable!

<Content>horrible how do i begin to explain well i will just be to the point dirty, they do not clean the rooms, doors do not lock securley, holes in the ceiling and in the floor, beds broke, tub dangerous to stand in, and very loud you can hear whole conversations from the room next to you. Out of 4 employees that we dealt with a lady named rose is the only nice one. Oh wait the only good thing they have a bar open 24 hours and between 4pm and 7pm it is happy hour and u get a to save a $1.00 so take our advice and DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Good value for all girls weekend! I was a little worried about this hotel at first. I did not think that it was in the best area, but during the day we had no probelms walking around. At night we took cabs back. The rooms were older and what you would expect to get for $89 at night. They were clean and the shower was hot. The staff was very nice and helpful.

Staff were very helpful and friendly. I would advise people to be careful late at night. We found that by returning via St. ANN Street the lights from Louis Armstong Park helped.We enjoyed our stay and would be cappy to return in the future.

<Content>Cheap but Cheerful Enough ! we had booked this hotel before reading the reviews on this site. I was very wary when we arrived but was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. Yes, it is old and definately befitting its two star rating, but the lady at the desk was AWESOME and took care of us totally. We had a room on the ground floor facing the pool, it was small but very clean, brick floors and high ceilings. bathroom left a little to be desired but we were only there for two days and didnt need a bathtub spout anyways !!! My parents had an upstairs room facing the pool, much better as it was away from prying eyes a little, although blinds and wooden shutters on the door are a very attractive silencer ! Ask for rooms facing the pool upstairs if you can. The street can get a little noisy. The complimentry breakfast was a few danish and cereal, with OJ and coffee.. so if you like a big fry up, pick a better hotel !We booked all our tours from the hotel at the desk, even spent time at the bar in the hotel, was usually empty or just a few hotel guests around, very relaxing after a day walking the quarter. The pool is nice, plenty of people swimming, some of the reviews on here down the pool, its not the ritz, but has fountains and loungers, what more do you need ?????The french quarter is about three blocks away if you walk directly across the road from the hotel and keep going. I wouldnt advise turning left from the hotel as that takes you into a not great area! Turning right takes you to Canal street which is the main strip but quite a walk past a park and not so great buildings at night. Daytime I wouldnt have a problem walking anywhere, we did !!! We walked at night to the quarter as there were four of us, never had a problem, plenty of people about and police cars dotted about too. If you like cheap and cheerful this is the hotel for you, we saw plenty of younger people , travellers and students staying here, we expected a dump but its not that bad and was clean. Staff VERY nice, they have private parking available and valet, just dont leave anything of value in your car ( enough said). I would recommend this to someone looking to save money, but if you can afford more than $50 a night, stay somewhere closer to the river. These rooms are NOT worth more than $50 a night.

<Content>Charming Hotel! The French Quarter Courtyard is a charming, authentic New Orleans style hotel with a wonderful staff. We were thoroughly happy with our room, and loved the pool and bar. Our room had shutters on the door to keep the light and noise (minimal) out, and the charm of the room in. Our only complaint is that it is a little far from Bourbon. Yes, it is only three blocks, but you have to walk several more blocks up Boubon to get to the action. We felt safe walking home, although my feet were a little sore by the end of the day! Overall, The French Quarter Courtyard was a great stay!!!!! (This hotel is not a chain, EXPECT New Orleans charm from this hotel!)

<Content>Didn't feel safe When I researched this hotel prior to our trip it didn't look that bad from pictures. However, when our shuttle from the airport stopped in front of it to let us off, I was embarrassed for the other people in the van to know we were staying here! The front desk person was nice, but not very helpful. Our room was clean and had character, but I just didn't feel very comfortable there. The worst part though, was walking to and from the french quarter because I really didn't feel safe at all. There were not many other tourists walking that direction, only a few homeless scary locals starring at us. I would DEFINITELY stay somewhere right in the french quarter where their are more people and police. Spend the money and stay somewhere nicer!

<Content>Go to the hotel next door instead We had a change of plans and called this hotel from NY to let them know we would be a day late. We'd prepaid, but figured we could stand to lose our money for one night, as we'd changed the plans. Imagine our shock when we got there the next day to find they'd cancelled all three nights. The rude and unhelpful lady firstly said she didn't get a phone call. When we showed her our phone log from our NY hotel bill she suddenly 'remembered' it, but insisted we only said we'd be late, not arriving the next day. A complete lie and no reason to cancel our PREPAID room for the following nights. At least she suggested the FRENCH QUARTER SUITES HOTEL next door, which turned out to be wonderful. Still waiting for our refund though. Plus the place was hot, humid and smelly. Highly unrecommended!

<Content>It's Not a Chain, and That's Good I made my reservations long ago through World Res. They never paid the hotel, so my reservations were cancelled. I called the hotel directly, Wendy took care of it at the rate quoted online, and mailed a confirmation directly to me. My party arrived, got right in, found two nice, old rooms and a clean, cool pool that fit in perfectly with this old New Orleans property. We walked five or six blocks to Bourbon Street and had a great time. It was my first trip to New Orleans, so the fact that the French Quarter Courtyard didn't look or feel like any other hotel I've been in was just as I (and the rest of my New Orleans first-timers) wanted it to be. It's worth a stay!

<Content>A charming hotel for the right price Me and a girlfriend stayed in this hotel June 3 - 6, 2004. We had a double room on the second floor facing the pool. Really quiet and the room was clean, spacious and had southern charm. Never felt the heat right outside the door. Air conditioned and ceiling fans are a plus. The bathroom is average. Be sure to bring your toiletries. Yes the exterior is a little weathered but still decent. The surrounding area, nearby park and cemetery are not safe for walking after hours. Take a $5 cab from Bourbon Street but otherwise a sweet little boutique hotel in good walking distance of the action.

<Content>Not a bad place...could have been much worse! My wife and I stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon about 4 years ago. Unfortunately, it was the beginning of September whih is still insanely humid in New Orleans. It wasn't the heat the got to us though, but rather the rooms air condiditioning!The A.C. was broken and we could not turn it off or down. As a result, most nights were spent in flannel p.j.'s and under thick comforters...or cuddling up! So it did have it's perks.The staff, while very friendly, rented our room out 3 separate times. We were awoken several times in the middle of the night by people trying to get into our room! Not the best way to be woken up!Finally, when it came time to check out of the hotel, the bill (which was supposed to be covered as a wedding gift) was not because the desk clerk had lost the credit card info used to pay for it. My wife and I had to place an international call (on our dime) to the people who had paid, to ask them to pay again! Fun times.Besides the minor issues, the hotel was charming. The pool was wonderful, and the proximity to the core of the quarter may our stay a memorable and enjoyable one. It's been 4 years since we stayed there. Perhaps things have improved. Overall, you could do a lot worse.

<Content>Incredibly friendly staff 6 girls for the weekend. Rough part of town? Yes perhaps. But nothing out of the ordinary. The only regret is its 3 blocks further walking than anything IN the quarter - which makes for faster achy feet. But the staff was SO INCREDIBLE it really felt like home. Walked around all hours of day and night no fears. Make sure to get a room NOT FACING the street - way too noisy. Cute courtyard and nice pool - the lady who dogged it must have never seen a NON-BLUE BOTTOM before. It was clean.

<Content>Great Staff in New Orleans The French Quarter Courtyard is a good place to stay if you want to visit the French Quarter and are on a budget. The best thing about the hotel is the staff. Miss Wendy will accomodate your requests without hesitation. Also the valets will get your car at any time without delay. The rooms are clean but could use some updating of the furniture and bathrooms. If you have loud neighbors that come in late you will definitely hear them. I was traveling on business by myself and really did not think the neighborhood was too safe at night to be out alone. But if you have some other people with you I don't think that you would have any problems with the location of the hotel. This hotel is for someone that wants to experience a quaint hotel and is not expecting the Four Seasons.

<Content>Great time, good hotel I stayed at this Hotel for the Jazz Fest. I had already booked the hotel before I read the other reviews on this site, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Either you like it or you don't. I really liked this hotel. It had a great little courtyard with a small pool, perfect for just relaxing at in between activities. The building has a lot of character and i really liked the way it looked, you felt like you were in New Orleans. The rooms were pretty basic and clean, I really like the exposed brick and wood beams, it gave it a great rustic look and with the AC and ceiling fans on, the rooms stayed cool during hot weather. Great location....a short walk to the french quarter and easy to navigate to almost anywhere. The staff was great and I met quite a few fun people in the lobby bar. Oh yes, its very reasonably priced. I would definatley stay here again. Anybody who didn't like this place probably likes the big chains.

We could not have been more impressed with the atmosphere and service. The room was tidy and comfortable. If you go to New Orleans and you want to experince the style of the Quarter, skip the chain places and stay here. Say hi to Leonard for us.

<Content>Shock and Awe The hotel is on a very busy street and within walking distance of Bourbon Street. The place is over 100 years old and the rooms look it, not in an elegant way. Expect to get NO sleep if you are put in one of the rooms facing the street. You'll get to hear all the street noise, including that from the cop cars which continuously drive by with their sirens blaring. Don't even bother turning on the TV to watch the show Cops. You can just look out the window that does not have a curtain covering it. Don't be concerned about any peeping Toms looking in your window because there is no shade to close anyway. At the break of dawn, expect to see sunlight blaring in on you. In summary, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the lock on the door did not work properly, and the staff was courteous and helpful, but I would not stay here again. Check around. You can find a better hotel for the same price.

<Content>Hotel from hell it isn't. If you want plasticized boredom then choose the Ramada or Hilton. If you want charm, friendliness and a sense of history choose the Courtyard Hotel.  The rooms are tiny,the decor eclectic and aging,and the shower pressure absent but the price is right. The adjacent Treme district may appear dangerous but probably only poses a threat to the reckless or stupid.  We had no problems with this hotel during our one week stay and recommend it to any neurosis-free visitor with realistic expectations.  A senior citizen with a marginal heart, I found the lack of an elevator presented no difficulties.

<Content>Had A Great Time This was my first visit to New Orleans and I thought that the hotel was charming. I do admit that the exterior of the hotel is a little off-putting when you first arrive, but other than that, I have no complaints. We staying in a lovely room on the second floor with two queen four-poster beds and a spacious bathroom. The balcony overlooked the pool, which was a life saver after walking all day at the Riverfront and Jackson Square. The area is perfectly safe if you are careful. We were only three girls there and we had no problems at all. When you go, make sure to order at least on Monster Girl, the hotel's signature drink. All of the staff were extremely helpful. My only complaint would be the parking charge, which I understand now is common in New Orleans. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice hotel at a great rate.

<Content>It depends on what you are expecting,naturally I read the awful reviews with some trepidation, for I had already booked an 8 day stay. I've just returned from my trip, and I have to wonder what those upset people were expecting. I only gave it 4 stars because I don't give five stars. Something could always be better. I called two days ahead to confirm my reservation. Upon arrival, everything went smoothly and we chose to stay in a third floor room near the rear of the hotel. The room was a bit warm, but the ceiling fan and air conditioning solved that. The floors are creaky, and some of the bathroom tiles are cracked. There are scuff marks in the banister railings. It is over 120 years old! It isn't a typically bland, sterile, corporate chain hotel. It has character and a few dings. If I could change one thing about the hotel, it would be a better mattress. Although we slept well, they could be a bit more comfortable, it is true. The location (just three blocks from Bourbon) made everything readily accessible. There are some sketchy areas in the area to the north and east of the hotel, but if you don't go over there, you won't have to worry about it as the main street that hotel faces is well patrolled by NOPD at all hours. We walked to and fro at all hours including New Years Eve and never had any trouble. There might be a panhandler around from time to time, but I defy you to show me a large city without homeless. The staff made the trip superb! Inside tips on local dining kept meals generally affordable and provided an inside look at life in the quarter. We felt like family and attentive service kept us perfectly happy. The clientele are as interesting as the staff, and we had many a friendly conversation in the bar. This hotel might be the reason we return to New Orleans in the future, because once you've done Bourbon Street for a few days, you don't need to come back for that. But, if you act like a whining moron, or a rude idiot, or a racist drunk, expect to get dissed. I saw it happen more than once, and I can't say that I blamed the staff at all. If you go with an open mind and a good attitude, prepare to have a great time.

<Content>One night in Hotel Hell My husband and I planned a dream trip to New Orleans for my birthday in October. Unfortunately I didn't discover these reviews while I was researching NO hotels on the internet. I chose this hotel based on its description and the reality left a lot to be desired. I called the hotel directly and booked a queen bed/non-smoking room with courtyard balcony three months before our trip. When the cab driver stopped before this building which is located on a VERY busy four lane highway (Rampart) my intuition told me to stay in the cab and tell him to drive on. But I wanted things to get better on the inside. We walked into the foyer, which served as the lobby--no doorman, no concierge, hardly a front desk. It was 2pm and we were told we couldn't check in until 3pm but that we could wait in the bar and they'd check our luggage. Before we gave them any information, I asked to see our room. The first room key they gave me (these rooms were obviously vacant and as ready as they were going to be when we got there at 2) was a TINY room with a closet-sized bath with only a shower, and a balcony overlooking the adjacent hotel and Rampart St. When I returned immediately, she offered me the honeymoon suite. The room itself wasn't awful, and it did have sunny windows and a french door that opened to the balcony that circled the building and overlooked the tattoo parlor next door. Other guests who were in the bar warned us not to walk to the left when leaving the hotel, only to the right, since it was such a rough neighborhood. We decided to give this room a try and were we ever disappointed. We walked about half a mile to a nice restaurant in the FQ, and returning back to the hotel was a little scary, even though it was only about 8:30. We then attempted to sleep. Between the constant stream of trucks and other heavy traffic on Rampart, the sirens of police cars, and the 24 hour bar that was at the foot of the stairs (yes, stairs--there is no elevator), we didn't sleep at all. People must have to stay drunk to stay there at all. The next morning I called the Ramada Inn on Bourbon, where we had stayed last year, and luckily they could accommodate us for the four remaining days of our trip. We packed up, called a cab, and drove to paradise--our friendly doorman, Larry, a helpful and knowledgeable concierge Ruth who helped make plans for an unforgettable birthday dinner for me for that night (at Delmonico's--she managed to get us a great table on such short notice), got us into the Court of Two Sisters Sunday brunch with no waiting while they cleaned our room, and we had time for a much needed nap before going out to dinner. We learned a valuable lesson. I doubt if we'll ever stay anywhere except the Inn on Bourbon. The rooms were exactly the same price, and what a difference in every possible way. Our room at the Inn was on the quiet courtyard with a private balcony. It's nice getting just what you ask and pay for.

<Content>They supposedly lost my reservation too I made reservations two months in advance. When I got there, the hotel also told me that my credit card number wasn't good so they canceled my reservation. They wanted me to pay more money. The place was dirty and in a bad neighborhood. I found a very nice room elsewhere for less than what they were demanding.

<Content>Not as charming as it looks I was very disappointed. It is technically only three blocks from Bourbon Street, but it's another three blocks down Bourbon before you get to anything AND you are coming in through a neighborhood that is not too nice. The hotel is on the edge of French Quarter, but it's also on the edge of civilization. North Rampart is a part of New Orleans that tourguides tell you to avoid. Unfortunately, we didn't know when we went there. The hotel itself was just OK. The furniture looked like it had been bought at a yard sale. The water pressure in the shower was nonexistent. I wouldn't swim in the pool if you paid me. And I've had better continental breakfasts at the local gas station. However, it was not all bad. We couldn't find a cheaper hotel anywhere within walking distance of the French Quarter, though I wouldn't walk in the area after dark. We had French doors to the upstairs exterior balcony, but the balcony and railing were in such bad condition we were afraid to go out there! And they did allow dogs of all shapes and sizes. I'd say this is a great place to go if you're just in New Orleans to party with your dog. But if you were hoping for something luxurious and sophiticated, this isn't it.
