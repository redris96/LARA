<Content>What A Disappointment! Spend the extra money and stay at the hotel within walking distance to the airport. Note limited shuttle hours and inconsistent service!Shuttle driver left early at the 23:45 final pick up and taxis demanded 30 euros for short ride to the hotel. Hotel staff have very poor customer service and defended the driver. Staff were disrespectful to the 4 hotel clients who were inconvenienced event (they even argued that the customers were not being truthful about the situation).Rooms and breakfast are ok, but not better than the 3 star hotels in the Netherlands.

<Content>Surley Staff, Expensive Hotel, Poor Location. This hotel is not cheap at the 鈧?75 a night corporate deal I got. The 鈧?00 plated rate is even more ludicrous. Breakfast is not included.The location is silly - an 鈧?8 taxi from the airport, as you'll find out if you return from the centre after the last Airport shuttle bus goes at 23:45.The wine list in the restaurant is a joke. Poor choices  expensive.Bar and reception staff are of variable quality from the pleasant to the downright rude.All rooms are non-smoking. To whit, next to the brochure that advertises hookers for 鈧?25 all-in (ahem), is a sign advising you that a 鈧?00 charge will be levied if you smoke in the room.As an aside, the new smoking ban in Netherlands has ruined Amsterdam. They are actually not allowed to use tobacco in their joints in the coffeeshops!!!!

<Content>Nice business hotel Stayed here on business for one night. There is a shuttle bus which runs regularly from the airport and takes . The hotel looks basic from the outside, but the room was modern, nicely decorated and clean. Minibar and free wifi. Room service was decent though not a massive choice. We didn't have breakfast, but the check out was fast, everything you need from a business hotel. Would stay there again.

Every time the bar staff were accommodating, rooms were well equipped and clean, restaurant staff very friendly and helpful. Good breakfast - wide selection of well presented and tasty food.

<Content>Excellent value! Excellent hotel! It was bliss getting back to this lovely relaxing hotel to unwind after a long day in busy Amsterdam. Very clean and quiet/cosy rooms, the bed was so comfortable(main thing right!) Very friendly staff and the breakfast is superb! Frequent shuttles to Aeroport and trains to Centraal station take about 15 to 20mn, easy access. This is excelent value and you will not be dissapointed. I will use it again the next time.

<Content>Worst experience since quite a while Not very friendly check-in, standard rooms are very small and dark. After getting through to the Duty Manager got then an upgrade to a so called business class room. Coffe machine was broken and they had to bring three replacements until it worked. Rooms overall not very clean either. DEFINITIVELY NO VALUE FOR THE MONEY.

<Content>Limited Shuttle Service; Poor location, but nice rooms I just stayed there for 2 nights. Not recommended for backpackers/singles. First of all... The room is amazing and well equipped/supplied. Clean, no smell, no noise. Staff had great service. Great place to rest/sleep.Biggest negative: Their shuttle service to/from Airport only runs from 0600-2345. If you need transportation during other times, you'llhave to take the Taxi (about $20 Euros), and only if you've reserved in advance. Shuttle is usually packed, but haven't seen anyone left behind. Hotel is about 15 min by shuttle to the Airport, so can't walk it. Shuttle was very prompt every time... so don't be late.The Airport can actually serve as a great base. Frequent trains to Central Station run 24 hrs. Return ticket is $6.20 Euros. 4am is cut-off point for day/night. Ride is about 15 min. Another 15 min walk tomost night life areas. Medium luggage storage locker available at $6 Euro for 24 hrs. Hilton and Sheraton seems to be within walking distance of the airport (500m), so might be something to consider. Cut out the reliance on shuttle service, and 30 min each way could mean big savings vs. city-center locations.If you have few luggage and flying out early morning, another option to save big is to store the luggage for the last night. Check out on the last day, store the luggage, party hard. Most bars/clubs close after 2am, but a few closes after 3am/4am time frame depending on weekday/weekend. Take the train back to the Airport, nap in the grandlobby, pickup luggage, and you'll be first in line at check-in. Would've done it myself if I knew this beforehand.

<Content>A solid performer International class airport hotels are much of a muchness, but the service level at this property was excellent, and the lunch buffet was downright superb. Plus, for convention-goers, the snack and coffee facilities were excellent. The only downside is the weak beer selection at the bar (which, being an isolated hotel, was the only drinking option)...

<Content>Amazing! Surprisingly this 5* hotel lived up to our expectations. We were very impressed with our room which was business class and with what the hotel had to offer overall. We knew it was somewhat out of the city centre but the hotel shuttle bus did a grand job of ferrying to and from the train station where the trains into the centrum ran every 10 mins until midnight and then every hour. The public transport system is excellent. Because we were there at the weekend, the queues into the museums etc were far too long but Zandvoort on the coast is worth a visit. Haarlem is only two short train stops away and highly recommended. Especially the ice cream shop by the church. Anyhow, back to the hotel! Although the steam room was broken and the fitness suite was only open until lunchtime at the weekends, the gym (so my husband tells me) was excellent. I did spend some time in the sauna. All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and extrremely helpful and all spoke very good english.

<Content>Radisson SAS Amsterdam Airport - Amazing! I recently stayed at the hotel for a night after flying into Schipol Airport. It was amazing! We got there around 12pm, and asked the front desk clerk if we could store our bags until we could check in. And the clerk said we could just check in then! It was great - especially after being extremely jetlagged. The room was amazing! Extremely clean, beutifully decorated, great view - and great toiletries in the bathroom. Also - free wifi - which is a great benefit. And getting into downtown Amsterdam from the hotel is very easy. Just take the complimentary shuttle to the airport, and take a 10 minute train ride into the Amsterdam central station. It's really easy - and you spend about half the amount of money to stay at the airport as you would staying in downtown. And, it's nice to stay at a hotel that's quiet and away from the bustling downtown area. After going into town, we ate at the restauraunt. It was quite good - and very reasonably priced. And the buffet breakfast is amazing. It's free with the room - and includes fresh cold cuts (including smoked salmon), many different cheeses and breads, eggs, meat, everything you could ask for. All of this for 133 euro a night - not bad at all. I only have one complaint - the fitness center and spa closes very early - around 2pm. But other than that, everything was great!

<Content>Great Hotel, especially for business We stayed here during a European trip. The stay was not planned but between this hotel and the one at Dam Square, they sorted out a last minute reservation for us. Easy parking, great service. We felt a little out of place as tourists but hat off to them, they certainly seem to have some pretty high powered, well dressed businessmen using the facilities.

<Content>Great Place to Stay I really enjoyed my stay here. Being near the airport you would think it would be very loud, this is not the case. We were in a room facing the airport and we didn't hear a thing. Staff were helpful and even helped us learn a bit of Dutch. Would have been nice to have 2 robes but that is my only complaint

<Content>No problems, great staff I overnighted here last Feb/March for work purposes. I would not have chosen to stay in an airport hotel, but due to a large car exhibition at the time, the city centre hotels seemed to be booked out.I had no problems with the free shuttle from the airport - they will email you the timetable if you ask about it. Peter/Pieter on reception was very nice and helpful re organising a taxi for the next morning. He also suggested a cheaper alternative means (ie go to the airport and get the train) but as work were paying, it was taxi for me! Next morning staff were also very helpful, friendly and efficient.The bar and restaurant are nice. Food is good... and that's coming from a *very* picky vegetarian. In spite of my good intentions, I didn't make it to the gym so can't comment.Room was comfortable and plenty large enough for me. No issues with noise or anything else. Due to its location, I would not choose to stay here if I was visiting Amsterdam for a holiday, but I would recommend it for people who need a base convenient to the airport.

Sound insulation was good so airplane noise stayed outside. Place was clean.Bathroom was also excellent.A true 4-star hotel where I stayed because I had an early plane out.

<Content>nice hotel but far away from city center hotel is very good. facilities are nice, thet have a very good organized gym. they have a free service to amsterdam airport every 30min. If you wanna go to amsterdam city center; the cheapest way is; transfer to the airport by hotels free bus, than buy a ticket for centeral train station of amsterdam(it cost 4.50euro) after 20min u ll be the center. Finally its nice hotel but if u wanna enjoy the amsterdam city u must be stay in a city center.

<Content>A series of annoyances Another review mentions that the hotel is 10 minutes away from Schiphol. True--but their shuttle closes down earlier than any of the other hotels' and it's a 20 euro cab ride. My experience of the hotel was a series of difficulties--a reservation canceled without notice, a free wifi system that was down (a fact discovered only after spending ten minutes on the phone being given various nonworking passwords), a general lack of timely information from the desk clerks. This hotel is in a suburban business district--it may be very convenient and useful on workdays; my very short stay there, on a Saturday, after a long train ride and just in advance of a long plane trip, was nothing but a series of frustrations.

<Content>Not recommended I checked in and then went into Amsterdam for the evening. I was given a schedule for their shuttle from the airport/train station back to the hotel. When I arrived for the shuttle there was already a crowd of over 40 people waiting for a 25 passenger shuttle. Obviously, the driver needed to make the 20 minute round trip to get back ASAP, but instead, he waited over 30 minutes to leave. Despite asking when the next shuttle was coming, he just disappeared into the airport. I called the hotel, and they said they were sending another shuttle. After waiting a total of over 70 minutes, a shuttle (the same one with the same driver) came. When I arrived at the hotel, they admitted that they could not send another shuttle because they only had one driver - no explanation why they told me (and others who called) another was already on the way.BTW, they did say they would have paid the taxi fee if I had taken one. But risky in my opinion.To top off the evening, the free internet access in the room did not work even after talking to the help desk.

<Content>it was ok The hotel is about 7km from the airport. On arrival we found the room to be spacious if not a little dated in terms of decor. The bathroom was also spacious with everything you would need. We arrived late (10pm) and so could only get food from the Hotel Bar. We ordered the Burger with fries. It was average - frozen chips and a mediocre burger.Neither of us slept well due to the overlarge pillows, causing us both to suffer neck ache. Apart from the pillows, it was a very comfortable hotel. On checking out we had a 15 euro parking charge unexpectedly sprung on us. (Mean to say the least). This would be the main reason for not going back I think.

<Content>Get a Deal and Stay We stayed at the Radisson SAS Airport June 16-18, 2006. We were a little concerned about the distance from the hotel to Amsterdam itself, but were pleasantly surprised that our middle aged selves were quite happy to travel out to the hotel at the end of each day. If you are going to bars and coffeeshops every night, this might be a bit of a hassle to get from the airport (where the train from Centraal will leave you) to the hotel, but in our case it proved to be quiet and enjoyable.The hotel is American standard - size, service, amenities. The restaurant was quite good and I can recommend the dinner meals there. Don't bother with the breakfast buffet - get yourself to a good pancake house in the city for much less. Great tub and bathroom in your room. Two things that picky travelers may notice:1. ask for a fan as the AC is pretty weak; and2. the shuttle to the airport is sometimes full, so you may want to get out to the shuttle stop early.All in all, the place is quiet, well appointed and larger than most hotel rooms that we have stayed in in Amsterdam.A good place for families, groups, business people.

<Content>Good airport hotel, with potential as a base for Amsterdam After a quick trawl through cyber-space I found a good rate for this hotel on a Sunday night as I passed through Schipol on business. I'd never stayed in a Radisson but seen plenty of their airport advertising and prime-locations, so I treated myself to a stopover in Radisson luxury. First of all, it's clear that this is a very good, international 5* hotel. The staff are all attentive, courteous, friendly and highly efficient. The shuttle from the Terminal was also efficient and swift (although the timetable is much more frequent (every 30 mins) than the poster at the bus-stop states - ring the hotel on the speaker-phone for details of the next departure). The room was spacious, spotless and well-equipped - as well as most, and better than many, five star places I've stayed in. The breakfast was very good, I thought - the best of the 5*s I've stayed in in the last two years - with the fresh orange juice maker a probable favourite with kids. The punctual shuttle to the airport, and the quick and easy trains into Amsterdam also make this a feasible (and potentially economical) base for exploring Amsterdam, or certainly for catching a concert or exhibition. However, perhaps this chain is also a victim of its own hype. Yes it was an excellent and efficient place to stay, but it didn't quite have the wow factor that one might expect or wish for (especially if you'd paid full rates during the week). For example, the self-proclaimed, 'world famous' Radisson burger was no more than standard fare. The rooms were also of undoubted 5* class, but could have had more character and design-flair. Thease are minor quibbles of course, but I'd believed the hype of Radisson over the years, and wasn't quite as amazed as they promised me I'd be...

<Content>Lovely airport hotel A great hotel 10 minutes away from Amsterdam Schiphol airport. Spacious, well-designed, and clean rooms. Generous breakfast (though it's a bit expensive at EUR 22.5 per person per breakfast, but many rates include the breakfast). Booking early you should get very good rates, at which you won't find a hotel of the same standard in the city. Helpful and reliable staff. There's a free regular shuttle service to the airport. The hotel is perfect for a stay close to Amsterdam Schiphol. Moreover, if you don't mind 10 minutes shuttle + 15 minutes train trip to Amsterdam, then it's definitely among the best-valued options for a stay even if you have a city break in Amsterdam.

<Content>Best Hotel i've ever stayed in Having stayed in the Radisson in Copenhagen in Feb '06, we chose this hotel when visiting Amsterdam. The hotel is without doubt the best I've ever stayed in.Staff were excellent, room was well equipped and very functional, food and drink was most enjoyable. The shuttle service was top class and always punctual - and thereby giving great connections to the whole of Amsterdam. Most important of all - all the staff spoke English !!!If visiting Amsterdam, I would recommend this hotel - although the rack rates is high, shop on the net and there are bargains to be had here, especially at weekends.

<Content>perfect for a stay close to the airport We only stayed here one night, but had a great experience. The people at the reception desk were helpful. The room was clean and comfortable and had all the amenities for a nice stay. Plus, the tram to and from the airport was a perfect way to get to the train and then into the city. I would definitely stay here again. The only problem was that we had a 7 a.m. flight and the first tram to the airport in the morning is 6 a.m. But the hotel called us a cab and we got there without any trouble.

<Content>Not bad, but expensive Good hotel, very close to airport but at the same time bit away, so don't worry about airport noice. Rooms looks a bit old and not so spacios. Doesn't feel as good value for the money - although reception  restaraunt areas are very nice, rooms, as mentioned, are quite old and have to be refreshed. Quite expensive too, comparing with others hotels in same area. Breakfast costs 20 Eur, if not in rate, and nothing special - typicall Radisson breakfast which in many areas called by them as super breakfast, but from my opinion there is nothing super there if compare with Marriott, for example. Good service, good shuttle connection to airport.Suggest only if you get a good rate with breakfast incl. or have to visit one of the offices near by.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - odd location I stayed at this hotel as part of a business trip. The hotel facilities are all top class - clean and in good order. The restaurant served good food, although I can't comment on the variety - we ate as a party of 14 and were only offered a fixed menu. My only issue with it is its location - it's about 4 miles from the airport (although there's a regular shuttle bus) and 12 or so miles from Amsterdam, meaning the only way into the city is taxi (about 40 Euro) or bus to the airport and then train. So if you're not visiting one of the nearby companies, I'm not sure why you'd stay there....

<Content>Radisson Good Alternative to Downtown The Radisson SAS at Schiphol is a good hotel, a little expensive, but good rates on the weekend. It is a nice alternative to staying in downtown Amsterdam, and for the same money, you get a lot more comfortable room and amenities. Of course you have to deal with the every half-hour shuttle service to and from the airport, and the train back  forth to the city. My biggest gripe is the high cost of high-speed Internet service; they charge 30 Euros or so for 24 hours, which is absurd. Other hotels either give you the high-speed Internet service for free, or charge a more modest price. Stick to dial-up if you have to, don't reward the hotel for charging such exhorbitant fees for what is becoming a business necessity.
