<Content>A different hotel Other than we usually see in European hotels, this one has a great personality. Each room has a different theme, I stayed with my boyfiend at the most minimal one and an other friendly couple at the Confucius room.Ok, I have to admit that the tv was a bit old, the boathrooms of both rooms too small but still you have the sence that you live in a narrow Holland house.The most amazing thing in the room was the Cocomat brand bed. THE BEST sleep ever! The location was very convinient, close to tram stops and close to the center.The breakfast in the different locations on the ground floor really amazing, especially in the computer room area.So, in terms of value for money and for a stay in a non-business, big and impersonal hotel, Hotel de Filosoof is really really cool

<Content>In need of work We stayed in this hotel after having been there a few years ago.It has most definitely gone downhill. The staff were as helpful and friendly as on our previous stay and I can't comment on the food as we didn't eat there. 15Euro is a bit much just for breakfast!However after having stayed in the annexe last visit I expected a bit more pleasant surroundings in the main building this trip - but was I disappointed! The bed was vaguely comfy, but the bedding looked decidedly like a dead dog! After 4 nights I looked like a dot-to-dot book I'd been bitten so badly by SOMETHING! The paint was hanging from the ceiling, we had to ask for towels every night and how many hotels don't have at least a kettle in your room. All in all a big disappointment (and not a cheap one a that) and not somewhere we'll go back to.

<Content>Very Average The hotel is nicely located in a quiet side street off Overtoom, close to tram stops and Vondelpark, and walkable to the city centre - this is the upside. Our room was in an annexe, and was very tired and dingy. I accept the hotel is intended to be characterful and quirky, however our room was simply in need of a major makeover. It was only superfically clean, and was also cold and draughty. The bathroom was tiny, with a dribbly shower. Building work was going on next door, and with Dutch builders starting at 7 am, there wasn't much opportunity for a lie in. Whilst this is only temporary, the hotel didn't handle it very well from a service point of view. Breakfast was also very average - I haven't seen tinned fruit in hotels since the 1970s.

Now i,m looking for comfort, good service and value for money. The Hotel de Filosoof fits all these categories and i would recommend it unrservedly

<Content>Fab location, good breakfast, lovely but expensive Second time staying here and no particular criticisms of hotel other than expensive - ended up more than we'd expected - maybe down to us.The location is excellent - minutes from the Vondelpark and tram to Central Station a few meters away.On second occasion we were in the annex. OK but we didn't know til we got there.Breakfast is good and plentiful.Would recommend for a first time visitor but we'll explore and experiment with other hotels next time.

<Content>What a wonderful stay! We spent a long time looking for a hotel in Amsterdam. We finally settled on The Hotel de Filosoof. It was a great decision to have made, and a real relief when we arrived, since even the good hotels have their fair share of bad reviews. We contacted the hotel directly, who matched the internet agent's price, and where very helpful. We turned up late, but reception is 24 hours, the lady who greeted us couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel staff were all friendly and polite. We were made to feel very welcome. The room (39) was very clean and pretty. It was well put together and comfortable. The bathroom/wetroom facilities were great. The stairs, which we only used once were steep, but unlike many of the reviews we saw for other hotels, we are pleased to say this did have a lift. We only sampled their breakfast selection once during our stay, which was on the last day, as we were quite interested in seeing a few local places to eat. The food we had was good, though the selecton was a little basic, they refilled the platters and shelves very efficiently whilst we were in the extensive breakfast room. They had internet facilities, but we didn't use them, unlike the hotel bar, which was very well manned and relaxed. There was a lovely litlle patio garden to the rear of the hotel also. We loved the location, as it was near(15 mins)to the more central parts of Amsterdam, but far enough to walk off a good dinner or relax a little before getting back to the hotel. Who wants to step out the door and be surrounded by bong shops in the red-light district anyway! All in all our stay was great and it was always a relief to settle in after a long day pounding the streets of lovely Amsterdam. Thanks to all at the Filosoof!

<Content>The Filosoof . Absolutely great service !!! Thank you Made booking with online internet travel group reservation site. Arrived at Filosoof hotel, but then I realised I made wrong booking October 12-14, instead of September 12-14. The Hotel was unfortunately full, and so were a lot of hotels in Amserdam, because of the a big number of visitors attending the IBC conference. The Hotel manager was very helpful to find us a nice hotel, call the hotel, arrange the room price for a 2 night stay, and offer us a drink. What a treat !!!!! Thank you very much for your service and so pity we could not stay in your hotel, that looks very nice, and well located and quiet area.

<Content>Nice Hotel - good location and good value for money My Girlfriend and I went for a long weekend in Amsterdam and the Hotel de Filosoof turned out to be a lovely hotel in a decent location.My girlfriend is Dutch so managed to get a special deal from a dutch website, which meant we got a room upgrade and breakfast for only 20 euros extra each. With breakfast at 15 euros this was a good deal and I suspect made a big difference in our stay.From reading the other reviews it seemed some of the rooms are rather small, ours however was a big spacious room with everything you'd expect from a hotel (tv, toiletries, towels etc). It was also very clean so we had no complaints with the room at all. The towels were replaced both days we were there and the bed was remade both times as well....something i was not expecting from reading some of the previous reviews.The breakfast is a good standard continental breakfast with plenty of choice and lots on offer! We took our coffee out into the back garden which was a lovely quiet space that takes you away from the city.As for the location; its right on a tram stop which takes 10 minutes to get to the city centre. Although we often walked which took about 30 minutes from the city centre but only about 15 minutes from the lively Leidseplein which has a number of bars and restaurants.It seems it is difficult to find mid range decent hotels in Amsterdam. Those that are dirt cheap often have terrible reviews whilst the hotels with solely excellent reviews are often extremely expensive. I shopped around for a long time and eventually realised most hotels have mixed reviews so gambled on this one. This paid of as the Hotel de Filosoof was a lovely hotel at a very reasonable price.

<Content>Suites with a story We stayed early spring for a 5 day minibreak in hotel the philosopher, and we fell in love. first we had a very warm welcome at the receptionists desk, they were very helpfull with giving us information and help carry up our luggage (the staircase is quite steep). we stayed in one of the wonderfull suites (115), which was decorated very stylish and even had a kitchen in there. The receptionist told us it used to be one of the appartements of the former owners !breakfast was fine with friendly personel, internet is for free and we did some great tours to the flowerfields and trough amsterdam the hotel was able to book for us.This was our first time in amsterdam, we loved it and look forward to vist this great city and the filosopher again, thank you !

<Content>disappointed..... We had great expectations about the hotel after seeing the pictures on their website. When we arrived the reception was not friendly or welcoming at all. We found we got a room across the street, that was a disapointment. After climbing 3 stairs we found we had an enormous room, not too clean. The bathroom was big as well but no basin so we had to wash our hands and clean our teeth in the little kitchen in the corner. Take a piece of soap, only small amount of fluid soap, no new soap after one day. There was a senseo coffeemaker in the room, not very clean, didn't want to use it. Breakfast average. All in all we've had much better for less money in other places.

<Content>good location if you go tu run the marathon I went to Amstardam to run the marathon in October. The location of the hotel was great to get the strating line in the morning by bike. I was expecting better because I had read many good comments about the hotel, we got the japanese one which was in another building. Breakfast was good, the bedroom just ok. I found a little bit expensive for the bedroom we had to be honest.Free internet access was great.

<Content>Nice and cozy - Small rooms! As it was our first time in Amsterdam, we were not quite interested in booking a fancy hotel. De Filosoof seemed to be a good idea although its price seemed a little bit high. However, as all hotels in Amsterdam didn't seem to be any cheaper, we thought we would give it a shot! Location was nice, very close to a tram stop, the area very neat as the hotel was located close to Vondel Park and only a few minutes walk from Van Gogh's and Rijks Museum. The breakfast room as well as the hall were cozy and quiet, you could enjoy your breakfast or coffee while reading or having a nice chat. Rooms were tidied up on a daily basis, they were warm and quiet. Breakfast was satisfactory, service ok, staff quite friendly. However, our room was so small that we could bearly move without bumping into each other. I presume there are some bigger rooms, but a price of 115 Euros (inluding taxes) for such a small room was a little bit disappointing!

<Content>Not very satisfied We have stayed at this hotel in October 07 between the dates of 18th-21st. It was our first travel to Amsterdam,we have been told this is a city center hotel and I read the reviews that the rooms are themed by the famous filosoofs, I liked the idea. We arrived the hotel which is on a quiet nice neigbourhood, couldn't check in because it was early, left the bags, we spotted that there's a tram station 5 min away and you need to take tram to go to the city center which is almost 10 min. away. We have stayed at the other building ( not the main) accross the street, it was Goethe room, room was ok but I can't not say it was unique and special, I thought it was a little dull. The main building is a little bit old too, the staff was ok but the breakfast was very bad.I also read the bathroom was very small which is very true. The location is good if you like to take long walks in nature because the Vogelpark is just like next door. Next time I am sure I will stay in other hotel close to the center, it saves more time and energy.

<Content>Thumbs Up for the Filosoof The Filosoof is an unexpected gem. We thought we would struggle to find a nice, interesting, convenient and VFM hotel in Amsterdam at short notice (and with an eight year old in tow) - but we did! A ten minute tram journey from Centraal Station, the Filosoof is located in a quiet residential area near the Vondelpark. Our room (situated across the road from the main hotel) was funky in decor, and had everything we needed (including a single bed in an alcove for our child). The bathroom was a bit small and the bed could have been a bit more comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfasts were generous. We would stay again.

<Content>huge bed (or was it?? hmmmm) we stayed in room 114 which was across the road from the main hotel building! we had the room on the first floor which had (we thought) a huge wide double bed, but on closer inspection we realised it was two single beds pushed together and the bedding was for two single beds! this made snuggling up at nite difficult, but it meant we were far enough away from each other to not hear the snoring!breakfast was average, but the room was huge and it had a bath as well as the shower!! ideal location for hopping on and off the trams or going for a walk in the park. we didnt have any problems walking back to the hotel late at night!!we'd go there again, but next time i want hoisted in with those hooks they use for furniture, instead of trying to negotiate the stairs ( i aint a mountain climber) wendi and alex from scotland

<Content>Quirky and friendly hotel but had some problems The hotel description struck us as quirky and interesting, and the price was OK so we booked it for a 2-night stay. It was supposed to be in a nice neighbourhood, but in February, the neighbourhood struck me as a little drab and deserted at night, so I wouldn't recommend walking back there from the heart of town if it's too late. Luckily, the hotel is fairly near a tram stop, so it's not too difficult to get here. It's also next to the Vondelpark, and there are a few restaurants within walking distance, although few of them actually look very compelling.The staff at reception were friendly and pleasant, so we have no complaints there. We were given a room on a floor that had been recently refurbished, so the smell of paint pervaded everywhere. Even worse, they had used paint or glue in our bathroom, and the smell was extremely strong in the room, which was of a modest size. But we were told to expect that from hotels in Amsterdam, so that wasn't the biggest problem. However, we spent the first night freezing, because a gap had been left in the window overhead. Shutting the window however, meant that the strong paint smell from the bathroom was suffocating. We spent 2 nights here, and the first night I couldn't sleep ebcause of the cold, and the second night, I didn't sleep because of the nauseating smell of paint!We had no idea what philosopher our room was meant to represent - there was a flaming, golden tulip painted on the wall, and there was a homey, eccentric feel to the decor. The bathroom was so small that if you sat on the toilet, you would bump your knees on the sink. And it was impossible to use the shower without the water going all over the floor. The bathroom was as small as a wardobe, and could best be described merely as 'functional'.No problems with the cleanliness, and as I remember, the breakfast spread was also quite acceptable. It was an interesting stay, because it was really the quirkiest hotel I've ever stayed in, but I am in no rush to repeat the experience. I probably won't be booking this hotel on my next trip to Amsterdam as there might well be better offerings closer to the heart of the city.

<Content>Very nice hotel, good breakfast - great stay! I stayed at the Hotel de Filosoof in August 2007. As the trip to Amsterdam was a birthday present for my brother everything had to be perfect. And it was! We had a three bed room and a double room and both were really nice and big. The bathrooms were quite small, but big enough for 2 people. When we opened the window we could hear the noise from the big street in the near of the hotel (Overtoom), but when you close the windows, it is completely quite. The next tram stop (tram 1) is at 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The breakfast was very good (ham, cheese, eggs, jam, fruits, various sorts of bread). And the best: if you want you can have your breakfast in the wonderful small garden! Attention: you have to pay a city tax of 5 % of the room price. But you have to pay this tax everywhere in the Netherlands, not only at this hotel. Summary: I definitely can recommend this hotel!

<Content>Nice idea makes standard hotel better We stayed here long weekend in July. Hotel is located in fancy neighbourhood next to Vondelpark with walking distance/ easy tram access to tourist areas. We chose the hotel, because it has a unique idea compared to hundreds of other similar, budget hotels and it was far enough from tourist trap areas with thousands of drunken English. The Hotel's idea is good enough to make it nice experience. Yes, rooms are small in this category, but that is something you can expect when travelling in Europe. You get what you pay for-and here you get something nice extra: unique idea. The personel was really friendly and helpful all the time. Rooms were little old, but ok. Like someone mentioned, the idea cover's well the oldness. We didn't have any problems with anything. Enough space in room with that sum of money, normally working bathroom etc. Even the breakfast was good enough. There are always the city taxes in Amsterdam and several other cities. Unfortunately some internet sites doesn't inform that. Hotel is maybe little far for walking several times a day to tourist areas, but there is easy access to everywhere in the city with trams (stop is 300m from Hotel) or even better is rent a bike! There are several companies in tourist areas and one is near hotel in Overtoom: the price is ~20鈧?/day and it's really nice way see the city and much better than walking鈥?br/>If you are not interested in whores and drugs, this is really nice hotel for you far enough from red light dictrict. Instead there is short distance to REAL Amsterdam: Jordaan, De Pijp and many cultural sites.

<Content>Nice hotel but with hidden taxes! We have been in this hotel in May ! We were in 3 people. We chose it because first the price was very good comparing with what the other hotels were offering at the time and also we loved the idea of each room was decorated in different ways. We love boutique hotels!The localization was very good. It was near Van Gogh museum and 2 minutes walking from the park Vondelpark.. Also it was easy to come back from the center as there was a tram stop 5 minutes walking from the hotel.The room was nice but the bathroom was extremely small that I could not change myself inside without open its door. For us that we are tall it was a nightmare. Another detail that we did notice was that the room was quite dusty !! But apart from that it was ok! Also the TV did not have remote control and most of the channels were dutch so if we want to watch TV it was not possible!The service when we arrived was very warm.The problem started when we found out that we have to pay an extra tax that the hotel's manager said that was a city tax that we did not know about it as in the website that we booked the hotel did not show any extra tax to pay. What amazed me was that when we complaint to the manager the way that she behaved in my opinion far from give a best customer experience. If you want to go there the hotel is very nice but be aware of hidden taxes that at the end they will make you pay .A. M. , London, UK

<Content>Even Among Stoner Hotels, This Place Is A Pit The room was incredibly small, looked like a closet 鈥?in fact, I still haven鈥檛 convinced myself it wasn鈥檛 a closet. Most of the rooms at the Filosoof are named after famous philosophers and theologians (ie, the 鈥淐onfuscius Room鈥?or the 鈥淣ietzche Room鈥?. If I had to guess, my room was the Shamanistic Ritual Room.鈥?Staying there certainly bordered on a pagan rite 鈥?the elevator (such as it was) thumped and trembled the floorways all night, and joined the ongoing slamming of doors and voices of young stoners yammering until the very. Wee. Hours.The following morning, despite my better judgement, I decided to take a shower, but lo and behold, the hotel had no running water, surprise, surprise. When I called downstairs, the staff informed me the construction crews in the street had ruptured all the water lines. They noted that they would be glad to phone me when the hotel had water again. Never did get that call.Speaking of construction outside the hotel, the tangle of bulldozers and steam shovels, along with pools of swamp muck made navigating one鈥檚 way to the tram lines a Lewis and Clark affair 鈥?no place for fine shoes, ladies. I will never spend another night at Hotel Filosoof, as long as I have the strength to crawl to the nearest bus stop. At 130 euros per night, plus extra charges to make local calls on the phone, one would expect a lot more 鈥?or even a little more. I鈥檓 trying to remain philosophical about my experience at the Hotel Filosoof, but staying there again would require a leap of faith that goes beyond philosophy to blind superstition or stark, raving lunacy.

<Content>Enjoyable stay We stayed in the Spinoza room. This was over the road from the main building. It was very quiet and peaceful, no noise at all at night. The Spinoza room was quite big, by european hotel room standards and there was actually a small ante room with a double bed in it which made it a family room I suppose. The one thing I didn't like was that the room was rather dark and the bathroom was very small, but as I said we've stayed in smaller rooms elsewhere in Europe. As for the hotel proper, we thought it was rather charming. There was a choice of where to eat breakfast, we would have loved to eat in the garden but the weather was just too inclement. The breakfast was fine. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel wasn't in the centre of town, but it wasn't a long walk into town, we would recommend buying tickets for the hop on hop off canalbus.It was a great way to see the city and saved the legs. The kiosk is just at the bottom of Overtoom, at the Leidesplein. We ate at the Peper N Zout, which is on Overtoom, the main road into town. It wasn't cheap but it was very good. We would recommend visiting the Jordaan ( we ate at the de Zagerij cafe on Westerstraat...very good, hearty food and large portions) and the de Pijp area ( when the market is on...a lively area.)

<Content>Nice location, lousy hotel The location of the hotel is great. 50 meters from Vondelpark, and the garden is great for breakfast. But the hotel proper is lousy. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are microscopic without shower doors, so the water flows onto the floor. The internet had been out for a while, with no indication that fixing it was urgent.On the morning I left, there was not hot water. Again, no urgency.

<Content>Comfortable and Charming Hotel We chose this hotel because of the philosophy theme and because of the garden. This was worth the price on both counts. We had a lovely breakfast every morning and drank our Dutch coffee in the garden befoe heading out. Some people have written that the hotel is a bit off the beaten track but there is a tram stop about a block away that makes it easy to get around town. The room was a tad on the small side and the amenities weren't lavish but the view of the garden from the room was wonderful - the bird songs were soothiing as well. Leideseplein is about a 10-15 minute walk and on the way there is the tourist kiosk where you can purchase your I Amsterdam books with several options for your length of stay. The hotel is in a quiet area and the guests were quite nice as well. There are a few steps to climb to get to the main level so I wouldn't recommend it for those who can't get their bags up or down several steep stairs. The elevator works well and is lavish by European standards (think twice as big as Italian hotel elevators!). All in all, this was a quiet, delightful property and if I went to Amsterdam again I'd certainly stay here a second time.

<Content>pretty nice Good location in a nice neighbourhood, approx. 5 minutes by tram from the city center. Liked the bed, sheets. Breakfast was OK but just lacked a little sparkle.Where are the fresh croissants and some other sweets? Where is the fresh fruit salad? Yes, you offer apples and pears but when I am on holiday I want it ready cut! Friendly staff and welcoming lobby. Did not like the bathroom very much (room 135). Too small and below standard. As every room seems to be different, they might very well have other bathrooms which are very nice. But make sure you check. Sofa in the TV room was not very inviting. Management, please change it and put a normal, comfy sofa in!! Would recommand and would put this hotel in the top 20 of character hotels in Amsterdam.

<Content>My place in Amsterdam!!! Simply enjoyed my stay at the Filosoof. My wife and I stayed in one of the new spacious suites. It was located on the other side of the road, opposite of the hotel. Our room it must have been at least 60 square meters! A ballroom! Lovely furnised and decorated and located in such tranquility, downtown Amsterdam. Never stayed in such a nice and spacious room in Amsterdam. Reception staff was very helpfull and so was the barman (I think his name is Willem) who carried our bags to the room.De Filosoof is with no doubt one of the most friendly and unique hotels I have stayed in. A real find!

<Content>Great Experience Hotel de filosoof We stayed at Hotel de Filosoof in Amsterdam....what a great experience. (We had made a booking through an agency for a different hotel and through a mixup of the booking agent, our rooms not only weren't reserved (had been prepaid), but the hotel was full! Luckily, the staff got us rooms at the Hotel de Filosoof which turned out to be our good fortune!) Though there are rooms located in the hotel proper, our rooms were actually located across the narrow street from the hotel and were brand new....all new carpeting, new, modern tiled bathrooms, new mattresses which the staff said were from an ergonomics store...and they were so comfortable! Rooms, at the reasonable rate we paid, can be very small in Amsterdam, but our twin rooms had ample space. The street was very quiet, next to Vondel Park and within a few minutes' walk from the Museumplein; lots of restaurants and the trams on a cross street made the location perfect. The hotel has a nice sized lobby area with comfortable chairs and a bar...we enjoyed a drink and conversation after a busy day of sightseeing! The breakfast room is very nice....several areas in fact in which to have breakfast including a windowed porch. Breakfast was excellent with fruits, cereals, assortments of delicious breads and rolls, eggs, meats, cheeses, coffee, tea, etc. The breakfast staff was very courteous. Also, there is a very nice garden in the back of the hotel proper....various areas to sit with tables and wicker chairs, very quiet and quite lovely. There was a computer on which to check email....very convenient.The staff was truly exceptional - very friendly and kind, giving us tips on transportation, restaurants, etc. They recommended an excellent restaurant in the Jordaan area, Luwte on Leliegracht, a street that is around the corner from the Anne Frank House. We highly recommend this hotel for good value, great staff, comfortable rooms, great location.Kathy and Mike

<Content>A wonderful experience This hotel was very warm and friendly. The hotel staff went above and beyond the call of duty to help me make transportation arrangements to get to Gent, Belgium. Since I speak no Dutch or Flemish, the female clerk at the front desk spent much time on the phone, then wrote all the information I needed in English, giving me very specific directions so I would not end up on the wrong train, and would not miss the train I had to change to in Antwerp. (Her English was impeccable.)My room was clean, comfortable, and I had no problems with it. I enjoyed all the philosophical quotes and pictures of great philosophers in the hallways, lobby, and my room.The buffet breakfast was fresh and more than adequate. There were many different foods to select from, and the coffee was the very good.My room had a nice view of a church and the hotel courtyard. The internet service was free, a fast connection, and there was no time limit if no one else was waiting to use it.There were enough nice restaurants to walk to in the area - which seemed like a safe and quiet neighborhood.The tram system was easy enough use, and next time I will buy a pass. The walk from the tram stop to the hotel was quick. I did not have nearly enough time in Amsterdam, and would like to go back. I would certainly consider staying in the Hotel de Filosoof again. While it is close to some museums, it was a little too far out from the main part of the bustling city- such as the Dam Square area - for me to want to go back out at night.
