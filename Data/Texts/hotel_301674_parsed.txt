<Content>Never again!!! I have travelled to many countries and stayed in lots of hotels and this definitely rates this as thee, singularly most disappointing. We paid a lot of money for this holiday (1000s) and had booked through Hayes and Jarvis. On arrival, the girl at reception, whom I can almost describe as hostile kept referring to us as expedia customers, which appears to be a great disadvantage when it comes to room allocation. I tried to communicate that we were not expedia customers but had booked through a reputable agent. Our room which was in the tower block of the hotel which is circular was very small, (don't bring your cat you won't be able to swing it) and the strangest shape. The door opened onto the bed almost. There was an unpleasant smell in that room throughout our stay there. The decor was like something from the 70s or 80s; brown, brown, brown! And I am sure that is when it dated from. The TV was also really dated.One day our room was not cleaned or made up at all and when we complained about this we had to vacate it, after a long day walking around the city, to let them do this.The pool area is located next to the kitchen so all you can smell when lying there is grease from the kitchen funnels.I can honestly say this ghastly accommodation almost ruined our stay in Singapore!

<Content>Simply the Best Value in Singapore I booked this hotel through one of the web sites, because it seemed one of the best values here in Singapore. Not only was I not disappointed, but I have been pleasantly surprised. My room is clean and spacious and the service is excellent. There is even a balcony, if I wanted to go outside in the steamy weather. There is also a bathtub--important to me--in which I can stretch out. The less expensive rooms are on the back side of the hotel, where there is less street noise. All in all, I highly recommend this property for business travelers looking for a bargain.

<Content>not as good as it should be! We stayed here for 3 nights on the way back from Australia. Despite having requested a non smoking, double room when making the booking 4 months ago, we were offered a twin room  the smell of smoke on opening the door was overwhelming. We requested a different room and were then given a double, non smoking with balcony overlooking the pool. Although this was a deluxe room, the carpet was quite soiled and the fridge on its last legs. Towels had only been provided for one person but since it was 02:00 am we made do.The next day we left the hotel about 09:30 and returned at 15:00 hrs, the room had not been serviced so still no towels. After requesting the room be cleaned  towels provided we went to the pool. We returned to the room at 17:00 hrs  it had still not been cleaned. A further request resulted in an offer of complementary drinks in the Club lounge while the room was cleaned, it was 18:45 before the room was ready.The following day was similar, on returning to the hotel at 15:30 it had not been serviced and again we had to make several requests before anything happened. Later in the evening I ordered ice from room service, it never appeared.Allocating the correct room  providing an efficient cleaning service  room service are the very basic requirements of a hotel  they failed to deliver on this occasion.

<Content>Very friendly and No problems Also can't understand negative reviews - were upgraded from Superior to Deluxe room because there were no superior rooms available. Good size room with balcony. Pool was well used by many of the guests. Concierge very helpful. Check-in and out was hassle free with very friendly staff. Used 1 of the restaurants and service and food were excellent.

<Content>Very good I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews on here - unless parts of the hotel are still being renovated. I stayed in the tower part which was very good - air conditioning was excellent which in Singapore is a must.The rooms are quite small (the bathroom especially), but otherwise a decent place to stay for a few days. There was a regular free bus into town, and it's only about 15 mins walk to Clarke Quay (about 30 mins to Orchard Road).Happily stay again, although as ever I do resent having to pay extra for the internet when you pay a fair whack for the room in the first place.

<Content>too dirty to be acceptable this place's best times must have been decades ago - room size ok, but carpets and chair simply disgusting and dirty, nothing you'd really like to touch. fridge did not work. not a recommendation even though this might apply for most of singapore's hotels in this price range - nothing to write home about!

<Content>Nice Hotel and Good Location We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon for 3 nights before going on to bali. ( Booked through Virgin Holidays)We arrived at 8.30ish in the morning after a 14hrs flight from london,our room was ready for us as soon as we got there which was great.The room was very clean and tidy. ( bed was HUGE!)The Location of the hotel was great it was about a 5/10 min walk to bars and shops.The hotel has a bus stop right outside the hotel which the open top bus tour stops at every day. (well worth the money for this as you can get on and off as much as you want between 9am and 1800)We also did the Night sarfai with the dinner included this was worth every penny this is a must for singapore.Overall the hotel was great and the staff were very helpful.Would go back again in the future.

<Content>DO NOT STAY HERE Firstly I would like to say I am not the sort of person to complain or get mad about things going wrong but this place was a JOKE!At 7 am we arrived at the hotel after being assured we would have a room straight away. We were told by the reception staff that our room had been cancelled by the mysterious mr knowbody. we had booked for a Superior King non smoking room and we were informed that we could have either the non smoking room with 2 single beds in or a smoking room with one double bed. We opted for the smoking room due to us being a couple and after being reasured that it was well ventilated.We were then informed that this room would not be available until 2pm. So with out offering any facilities or complimentary refreshments for the inconvienence we were left to wonder around singapore at 7am in the morning after a 13 hour flight from manchester.... When we returned to the hotel we found our room was ready. except it had the most disgusting smell of ciggerette smoke. It was infact still hazey from the last guest. Oh yes and you could not swing a hamster let alone a Cat in that room.After several complaints and finger pointing from both Virgin and the Hotel we were offered the room with the two single beds AGAIN. What the hotel failed to grasp was no matter how many times they offered us the wrong room it would never be RIGHT, it would never be what we paid for. Eventually the offered to give us some air fresheners and a deodouriser (which never arrived).Eventually we just gave up complaining. It was a pointless exercise. There is nothing I can say good about this hotel appart from the day we left. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!

<Content>Absolute disaster We arrived very early in the morning. We were suprised that there was a free room as we would normally expect to get checked in around 2pm. However, despite having this holiday booked over a year in advance, we still managed, despite being on our honeymoon and non smokers, to get a twin smoking room. When I complained we were told they were very busy and would let me know when a king sized non smoking double, which we had requested, was available. The next day I was told we could have a new room. It would be a queen sized smoking room! Absolutely useless. When we complained further we didn't get any joy from anyone. We also dined at the Tien Court restaurant there. The food was nice but when we received the bill I was astonished! There charges are not clearly stated... you have been warned! The hotel as a whole was very clean. The rooms are very basic. By the time we left we were angry and stunk of smoke. I really cannot believe Virgin have this rated as 4 star. This leg of our trip nearly ruined our 1st wedding anniversary.

We were given an upgrade but had to accept a room with twin beds. It was very small and was very noisy due to the air con plant. The breakfast was also poor.My advice is stay elsewhere.

<Content>Hotel Ok, TINY ROOMS we went to singapore in May for a week. we were quite disappointed with the size of the standard room which was very small. When I looked on the web-site the standard rooms appear much bigger. There was no balcony and the hairdryer in the bathroom did not work properly. However the rooms were cleaned properly every day and generally a clean hotel. The food in the hotel was very expensive so its much cheaper eating out. There are lots of nice cafe's and restraunts over the river front which is a 2min walk from the hotel. Hotel very close to buss stop and impressive metro service. Good value for money for electrical goods. You'll find that one shop owner will own lots of diferent stalls in different electrical malls especially if your looking to buy laptops. Need to haggle for best buy! Orchard road was very expensive for shopping. Best shopping place for us was Marina Bay!! Affordable. Best exchange rate you can get is in Orchard Road. Mustafa Centre is open 24 hours per day and has everything you need. Little India was great! Lots of variety for food. We will visit singapore again. watch out for cabs which can not stop to pick passengers up from the main road as they will get fined so you need to go to a side road.

<Content>A Pleasant Base For A Wonderful City We stopped at the Copthorne King's hotel for 3 nights in April and found it to be a lovely hotel and nicely located just beyond Robertsons Quay.The hotel and it's amenities where clean and well presented and evreything you'd expect from a hotel in this class. The staff throughout our stay were friendly and very welcoming.Located a few minutes walk from Robertsons Quay, the hotel benefits from being far enough away from the noise and bustle of, say, Orchard Road whilst Robertson, Clarke and Boat Quay were all an easy stroll away.The hotel set the tone for our stay in Singapore - a relaxed and friendly hotel in a relaxed and friendly city.

<Content>No more than a stopover Sorry it's taken me a while to get down to recording my thoughts about this hotel. We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of February on our way out to Australia. We stayed in a room in the main towerblock, which seemed to be the main area for short stay guests. Frankly we were very disappointed. We were told that because we had requested a non-smoking room we could only have twin beds. Then when we reached the room we were amazed at its size. Not only was the space very limited, but the storage area was tiny too. The single wardrobe had no full length hanging space, and there were few drawers. There was nowhere to store cases so one had to be perched on the luggage cradle, causing an obstruction in passage to the bathroom, and the other had to be left on the floor at the end of a bed, filling the longest wallspace! As mentioned in another review, the bath is hilariously small, in fact I reckon it's an assault course shower cubicle!Away from the accommodation,our package included breakfast. It was OK, but I would not have chosen to eat there had I needed to pay, as it didn't represent good value for money in my opinion. The staff were very good. They were efficient, polite and obliging to most requests. A request to change the down pillow cases and quilts was dealt with in minutes, and the front desk staff were very happy to arrange a late checkout and changing facilities as we had an evening departure.It is a distance from the city centre, but the taxi to Orchard Rd is quite cheapand the walk to Clark'e Quay should not be a cause for complaint for anyone of reasonable health! We found it most pleasant. We booked a City tour through the hotel's website and, within the usual constraints of such tours, was very good value for money.

<Content>Quality hotel near the river but a little far from the city centre We stayed twice at this hotel as we had two stopovers in Singapore. On both occasions, on arrival we were told that our choice of room was not available, but were upgraded free of charge. The corner room in the tower section was great - very large, with a fantastic view of the river and had an enormous bathroom. Although it was a smoking room, someone was sent up with a machine to freshen the room up which worked fine. The second room was in the main wing, and although it was smaller and did not have a good view, the decor was better - fresh and clean, and looked recently decorated.The Pekanese buffet at the hotel was quite pricey, but was always full and apparently offers really good food, a claim backed up by the constant crowds of people eating there.Overall, I would recommend the hotel - staff were friendly and helpful, and our stay was trouble-free. My one complaint would be that the location is a little inconvenient. It's close to the river and a 10-15 minute walk from Clarke Quay, but much further to walk anywhere else. Chinatown can be reached in under half an hour, but you'd need to take a bus (cheap, regular) or taxi to Little India, Orchard Road etc.

<Content>King for a Night and a Day This is a nice 4-star hotel in Singapore.The staff are friendly and obliging. I arrived close on 8pm due to airline and traffic delays.Requested and got a check-out extension until 2pm .... no fuss or cost. Also received a free room upgrade after I requested a queen bed due to my height.Room was great and full-service amentities provided.The hotel is slightly out of the way - 15 minute walk to Clarke Quay (now has a MRT stop!!) , but Robertson Quay which has a variety of decent hotels and restaurants is closer still.I stumbled on this place after trying to get a booking at 3 other hotels. Singapore hotels are running at 97% capacity at the moment due to a room shortage.....I would stay there again.

<Content>Average Hotel - TINY Rooms We checked into this hotel for the last night of our honeymoon en route from Thailand back to London.The Lobby is that of a typical business hotel, nothing too impressive and Reception were helpful enough... We asked at reception whether they had a double bed available; however she informed us that they only had rooms with 2 single beds available.Then we got to the room....I would not recommend booking a standard room at this hotel because as we discovered, the standard rooms are located in a dingy wing and are very, i mean VERY small rooms. and the bathtub looked as if it was cut in half, you could not even sit down in it, it was the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen.We went down to reception to change rooms and they gave us keys to have a look at another room... what do you know it had a double bed! but again it was very small.We eneded up paying 150 SGD to upgrade to an executive room because we just couldnt stay in a room so small. Please understand i am not exaggerating, the room was very very claustrophobic there was almost literally no room to move around.The only bonus for this hotel is its location. It is located close to the harbour and a 10 minutes walk to Clarke Quay, which has a brilliant night life and great restaurants and bars.I would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Rude Front Office Welcomed by unfriendly lady on the front desk, get to our room, guess what? Dirty  used (uncleaned) room. Call the front desk, no one came, so we had to go down again, speak to the same lady. I know it's not her mistake personally but she didn't even apologize on behalf of the hotel, instead she's defending herself by saying It says cleaned  ready on the computer Oh my GOD, what a service?!?! The new room given is so tiny but anyway... the rest of the staff are fine, except that one lady who shouldn't work in the hospitality industry at all. The area of the hotel is not central either, I used taxi most time there, it's very cheap (compare to London taxi).

<Content>Good Experience After reading the most recent reviews of the Copthorne King's, I had very low expectations for my stay during the Easter break. Service was much better than I expected, everyone spoke to me in a courteous and professional manner. There was a number of minor irritations but I was able to brush them off as I had plenty of positive experiences during my stay. For example, after settling into my room on the 17th floor in the Tower Wing, I discovered an ashtray. I don't believe I specified a nonsmoking room when I made the reservation or was given a choice. There was a strong smell of perfume while the fan was on, and when it was off, a smell of smoke was noticeable. I liked the room, an odd-shaped room with a nice view of the Furama hotel next door as well as a garden below. I had the fan on most of the time, and that seemed to blank out the smell of smoke so I didn't ask for a room change. The bathroom didn't have a normal-size bathtub but a half-tub with the back elevated so you could sit on it. It would have been nice to lie in the bathtub but the half-tub was not too bad. I ordered room service for breakfast, filling in the order and putting it outside the door before 3 am. The order was delivered on time but one egg was missing. I only discovered this after the waiter had gone. I didn't have to specify I wanted 2 eggs since that was what was on the menu. The hotel's location is not as inconvenient as some have suggested. It is a short walk to Great World City, which is a nice mall with plenty of shops and restaurants. It is right next to the Miramar hotel, which is a stop on the Hippotours. And it is across from Saiboo Street, where you can access the river leading to Clarke Quay. I booked the hotel a month ago and got a US99 rate on Expedia for Friday to Sunday. This was my first time at the Copthorne and at a hotel in the Havelock Road area, so I wasn't expecting much. There were plenty of instances when I had to contact the hotel about something, and each instance was promptly resolved to my satisfaction. There were more positives than negatives from this experience and I would certainly consider staying at the Copthorne King's again.

<Content>Find another hotel We arrived at this hotel as part of a ten day trip the first seven nights being in Penang Malaysia. After a wonderful seven nights we were greated at the Copthorne Kings by the most unhelpful and sore face receptionist it has been our misfortune to meet her name was RUTH. She took our passports and our booking voucher fron Virgin Holidays, then proceeded after a five minute silence to tell us we would have to give credit details as we were not booked in and if they couldnt contact Virgin we would have to pay the bill and sort it out ourselves on return to the UK. We were then told that they were busy and that they had no rooms. When my husband started to get mad she managed to find us a room on the twelth floor, so small that we could not get into it with two full size suitcases, you couldnt unpack if you had wanted to given the the one wardrobe was almost compleatly filled with a safe. The bathroom was so small only one person would be able to go in at a time and the bath was big enough for a four year old child to sit in!At this point my husband got the Virgin brochure out and went back to reception with it. On production of this and the photo of the standard room that we had booked they amazingly had another room on the fourth floor. This had two single beds but at least it was a room with a real bathroom. The balcony lead out to the pool which was ok but the noise from the huge generator just outside was constant and would affect all the rooms on that side.We should also have received a basket of fruit on arrival and a late check out of our room as part of the Virgin flagship deal we got neither of these, by this time we couldnt be bothered fighting for them and just put it down to poor service and we would most deffonatly not recomend this hotel and shall also be writing to Virgin regarding them aswell. Just to finish although our room was not available for the free late checkout we could have kept it at a cost of 80 singapore dollars plus tax.There are at least six other hotels in this area choose another.

<Content>Chinese New Year Blues Booked a 1 night stay through wotif.com for 8th Feb (Chinese New Year - 2nd Day). Hotel room was comfortable. Amenities in the room was better than average. All amenities in working order. Room service was prompt. Hotel staff at lobby was quite dead though. No greetings or well wishes for CNY. They didn't make us feel warm or welcomed but that's ok, we didn't get the room for their company anyway. They were probably tired or pissed cos they had to work during CNY. Bellhop offered help to carry bag. Ample carparking space. All in all, it was a decent stay. They could however improve on PR to better their international standing with other hotel staff.

<Content>Great stopover We stayed at the Copthorne for just one night on returning to the UK. The location is excellent, just five minutes from Clarke Quay and restaurants. I have no complaints at all about this hotel, the staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs, baggage storage, rooms for changing, breakfasts they could not have been more helpful. The hotel has everything you need, very clean, courteous staff, good restaurant and bars. A special mention to the reception team at this hotel (we had bad experiences at the Orchard Hotel on the way out) they really were superb.

<Content>Great Location-Better Service This hotel was such a good choice for myself and my family. We were on our way back from Oz and chose to spend a week in Singapore. The shuttle bus from the hotel to Orchard Road meant that we didn't have to worry about taxi's or staying nearer the main shopping area (which is very very noisy). The food at the hotel is award winning and with good reason. The buffet is like nothing you've ever seen! They cater for western palates but it is generally chinese fair. Great quality and even better service. The smaller bistro style eating area was also good quality and I really enjoyed the more European cuisine. The rooms were clean, quiet and were comfortable and spacious. Copthorne Kings is one of Singapore's best hotels and retains a friendly vibe to boot!

<Content>Excellent hotel, This hotel is excellent, we stayed there in December and January on route to Oz, even though we arrived at half past six in the morning with our two young children the staff could not have been more helpful and put us into a family room straight away instead of having to wait around. Rooms are quite small but for a few days this is fine, they were very very clean and everybody in the hotel was more than helpful - just avoid the prices of the bar and restaurant!! although breakfast was included in the price and really was excellent. The pool was lovely with hardly anybody ever going in it. Tip regarding getting around Singapore - always go for the metered taxi as they are mega cheap, whereas getting the ones which have been called for seem to cost $35 no matter where you were going!! If you have youngest don't miss out on going to visit santosa island

<Content>Good for a Stop over We had a somewhat small room in the 鈥渢ower鈥?section of the hotel, which I think is mainly used by stopover passengers en route to Australia. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was very clean and welcoming. Wardrobe space was somewhat limited after luggage storage and the small sit in bath required careful negotiation in order to stand in a flat area for a shower.The room although small was pleasant enough but the lighting was very poor and I found it very difficult to read standard size font (such as 11 of 12 point) after it had got dark.

<Content>Okay It's ok. It's functional. Short walk to Clarke Quay.Too all those people that say rooms smell of damp... well that's because Singapore IS DAMP!!! All the hotels in Singapore are the same, all the mid-range ones anyway.This hotel is fine, if slightly dull. The pool is ok. The gym is tiny. You can walk to Orchard Road, 25-mins. Orchard Road is like one big, expensive, duty free shop...China Town and Little India are more earthy. But Changi Village is probably best for a relaxing stop over, a taxi ride from the sights but a walk to the beach and close to the airport.

<Content>Good all rounder I stayed here for a number of weeks on a business trip and, on balance, I would recommend this hotel.Location wise, the hotel is well placed. Chinatown is a relatively short walk (even shorter taxi ride) although you won't walk anywhere quickly in the humid day time. Orchard Rd is also a walk away, although I would recommend using the hotel shuttle bus as, again, the humidity can be insufferable at times. You can also walk along the river towards Clark Quay where you can take boat trips. There are always taxis outside the hotel and they are inexpensive. Getting one back, however, may be more of a challenge - especially in the rush hour.My room was a very comfortable double with quite possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept it. There was a small fridge with Tiger beer and a few other snacks and drinks which, although expensive by Singapore standards, seemed quite cheap compared to a British hotel's prices. The TV didn't always have the best reception but there was a wide variety of channels broadcasting in English and usually I could find something reasonable to watch when channel hopping before going to sleep. There was also very reasonable storage space, lighting and mirrors. The room did feature a balcony, but it was usually too hot and humid to stay out there at all during the day, so really it's just an aesthetic feature. My room faced out to the back of the hotel which was fine for me on a high floor, but not so good for those lower down as the air con units outside were incredibly noisy. Other members of my party were facing out of the front which apparently suffered from traffic noise. The bathroom was prefectly acceptable with a good powerful shower over a bath tub. My only quibble with my room was that the carpet suffered from patches of condensation from the air con. I didn't bother raising this with housekeeping as I really didn't want to end up in a room nearer the aircon units or facing out front.Breakfast featured a very good variety of food from many different nations and you'd have been hard pushed not to find something you liked. The pancakes, made to order, were a real hit with our party, the chicken sausages were not. The coffee was extremely bitter but the tea was a superb brew. Breakfast was presided over by a rather matronly member of staff on the door who eyed up everyone as if they were blagging their way in. I didn't try any of the other restaurants, other than the cafe in the foyer when I wanted something quickly. To be honest there are so many superb places to eat in Singapore that are so much cheaper that you'd be mad to waste your money in a hotel restaurant other than for breakfast.There is a hotel shop but I would advise checking first for items in the shop attached to the petrol station next door (to the right of the hotel as you face out). Their prices are much, much lower. Bottles of water, for example, were a fraction of the price of the hotel shop ones. There's also a very reasonable shopping mall, complete with supermarket, just a 5 - 10 min walk away. Get directions from reception as you'd be unlikely to happen across it otherwise.The hotel has a pool, although it is pretty small. If you fancy a larger pool you can take a taxi very cheaply to The Delta Swimming Complex which has 3 large pools, one of them a dedicated children's pool, and costs very little - something like the equivalent of 60p. It only takes 5 or 10 mins in a taxi.One feature of the hotel which really appealed to us (being there for a few weeks) was the hotel's launderette for guest use. This was inexpensive and powder was provided - bargain! Makes a change from washing your clothes in the bath or having to use pricey laundry services.We initially used the hotel bar quite a lot in the evening but found the service slow, indeed sometimes reluctant. We eventually started going to a bar over the road by the river where the service was superior.There were good business facilities and we were on a deal which included broadband access in our rooms. However, if your deal does not include this it is pretty expensive and you would be better off taking your laptop to one of the many bars in town which offer access to customers. Please note, they take a tough line on people piggybacking onto other's internet access in Singapore - so make sure you use it legitimately.Generally speaking I was happy with this hotel and found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly.

<Content>Not bad at all... This hotel was good. The rooms were clean and well-designed. They were small, but not overly tiny. The bed was rock-hard. People not accustomed to sleeping on a bed like this will probably wake up stiff the next morning!The bathrooms were nice and spacious. Also, the windows let in a lot of sunlight!The front desk is not overly friendly, but they were efficient and helpful. They got the job done.The bellmen were all extremely helpful and friendly. It is very easy to get a taxi by just walking out the front door, or by letting the bell captain know you need one. I thought this was very convenient. The closest MRT stop, Outram Park, is about a 25 minute walk from the hotel. It's just easier to take a cab. The pool on the third floor is really nice. There is also a hot tub and steam room, but both were not working at the time.There are three restaurants: one is a buffet (which was perpetually busy), one was a Chinese restaurant, and one was an extremely overpriced lobby restaurant serving western food. All in all, I had a nice stay here. I think this is classified as a three-star hotel, and people need to keep that in mind when writing reviews.

<Content>OK Staff were efficient but not warm and cheerful. The hotel is located in a good part of Singapore. Liked the modern design and cleanliness. Disliked the mini bathtub and uneven floor, made it very difficult to shower, bumped my elbow on the wall. Didn't look clean enough to bathe in. The room was tiny but well designed. The bed was very hard, I expected a hotel like this to use a plush mattress instead of very firm. But luckily the pillows and quilt were very comfy. Bathroom amenities were good, got toothbrush and body lotion. Weird shaped hair dryer that could induce one's imagination. There was a problem with the internet cable but was fixed accordingly. The internet charge was too expensive, 50 cents per minute. Called the front desk but not answered. No tea bags, snacks or electric kettle. No alarm clock. Carpet was clean. The opening and shutting of the connecting door outside drove me crazy. No Cinemax/HBO/Pay per movie. The armchair was not comfy, no headrest nor footrest. Good bathrobe. Overall, it's a good hotel, I will recommend it. But personally I won't stay here again as I don't like hard mattress and I want a movie channel.

<Content>Good Stop Over Hotel This hotel, alittle way from the city centre is a good spot for that two or three day stopover on the way to or from the UK /Austrailia. We found the staff helpful paricularly the Bell Captain. Unlike some otheres we had no problems with the room albeit in a superior grade room. Don't miss the swimming pool a little luxury used by few people, The hotel has a free bus to downtown which runs fairly frequently. However as metered taxis in this city are so cheap transport is really easy and affordable.  In summary a good stopover hotel particularly if you can get it at a reasonable price

<Content>Great Location. This was our first visit to Singapore and was very undecided which was the best area to stay. We decided upon this hotel and I think we chose well. The rooms are small and the bed a little hard but these are the only drawbacks. The location was great. Just a short walk to Clarke Quay where all the bars alongside the river are lit up at night. Try Brewerkz on the Quay where they brew on the premesis,this is reasonably priced.We would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>good for price Stayed here for three nights on way to Bali.Had already read other reviews before went and they were spot on. Nice clean hotel, nice revamped lobby. Staff were friendly.But as mentioned the rooms are very small and the beds were very hard. As I have back problems one night I had to get my husband to sleep in the single bed with me so I could pinch his duvet to lie on! The bathroom was clean but small too.We had the pool to ourselves and never saw anyone else use it which seemed a shame.The other problem which has previously been mentioned is its location. You are within walking distance of chinatown, so you can get to the MRT easy enough but its coming back. Its very very humid so by the time we left we were so glad to walk up the steps of the road bridge for the last time!The MRT IS 1000 times superior to the london underground. Its cheap, clean and fast. You never feel unsafe where ever you are.Taxis are cheap but you cant get one during rush hour and when we came from Sentosa island a taxi told us once in it was a fixed price. The price was about ten times more so we got out! Go for the metered ones.Its a good medium class hotel but only worth a few days stop. I would not have been happy to spend more time here. Even though we had a good view the room was to cramped and the beds too firm.Be warned if you go to Raffles and have a singapore sling they work out at about 拢12 each. its vastly over rated.

<Content>Value for money but rooms a little cramped Stopped over in Singapore on way back to UK from Australia after 4 weeks away  Rooms clean/tidy but felt cramped compared with other hotels stayed in  Reception Desk Staff OK but porters very helpful  Eat breakfast once ok  Evening entertainment in the bar throw back to the 60s  Location short distance to MRT but taxis are cheap  plenty of them Views about Sinapore may be coloured by being a bit travel weary

<Content>A Pleasant Hotel Generally, the hotel was well maintained, the staff very friendly  helpful especially the Concierge staff.We stayed in a 'Run of the Mill' room which was very small but well maintained.We used the swimming pool  jacuzzi facilities but due to the high cost did not use the restaurant facilities.Would use this hotel again only if nothing better was available.

<Content>good location I stayed here for a few days before travelling on to Australia and it is comfortable and convenient for wandering down to clarke quay or round to chinatown. Singapore is not a problem with transport as taxis are so cheap that we travelled in them all the time.As with previous reviewers I didn't use the restaurant as there is so many lovely places on the river.The room was OK, standard business hotel but internet access very expensive.

<Content>Fit for a King (or maybe just your average discerning traveller) My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of a Virgin Holidays/Asian Trails twin centre holiday to Singapore and Bali. The Copthorne Kings was modern, clean and welcoming. We arrived and were checked in with typically fast Singaporean efficiency and within minutes we were in our room.Virgin put on our hotel voucher that we were on honeymoon so we were given room 926 in the more modern tower with the curved front and nice view of the river. The room was clean and provided a perfect base for exploring Singapore.We didn't use the pool or the restaurants in the hotel (even though they looked and smelt very appealing) but simply because of the huge choice on offer around Singapore.Location wise the Copthorne Kings is so so, although it is directly next to Stop 9 on the SIA tourist shuttle bus which stops at all the major tourist destinations in the city, it was 15-20 minutes walk along the river to Clarke Quay and all the shops and restaurants there.Overall I would say this hotel is aimed at business travellers but my wife and I enjoyed our stay here and wouldn't hesitate to use it again. A nice touch was even after we had checked out and were waiting for our airport transfer they let us use the internet for free (to check in for our flight).

<Content>Will not stay here again The hotel has very small rooms, once we put our 2 suitcases in the room there was very little room to move around. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest MRT station (MRT), along some very busy roads.We will be visiting Singapore again but we won't be staying at this hotel again!

<Content>Pleasantly surprised Our family of four stayed at this hotel for two nights end November 2006. After a long flight we were able to get one room early for check in which was a great help. We were able to freshen up and leave our luggage in the room. Whilst the rooms were small they were comfortable, especially the beds! We found the service good and ate at the buffet one night, it was packed with local people and had won some awards - we enjoyed it very much and got a discount with our Singapore Air boarding tickets. The hotel had a lovely pool, steam room and sauna which we used to relax and cool down. Whilst the hotel is in a quieter area it was easy to get to and the Hop on bus departed from the hotel next door. We loved Singapore and will definitely be back.

<Content>nice location no problem! I stayed there for four nights on a business trip. Ther eis a morning breakfast buffet which was pretty good, had the usual european fare as well as items for the asian guests. In the evening the bar featured a five piece band which consisted of drum/guitar/bass with two go-go grils doing retro 60s hit such as Woolie Boolie..... charming in it s own way.The hotel is a fifteen minute walk to Chinatown so I ambled over there in the mornings when jet lag had me awake at an early hour. Don't miss the 6 am puja at the Hindu temple in Chinatown... dazzzling! the room was clean and quiet. I was the only guest who used the pool when I was there - too small to do laps but refeshing nonetheless. the gift shop opens at 10 am and they were out of postage stamps when I stopped by.otherwise nothing extraordinary - an okay place for a few days....
