<Content>Reasonable Hotel with good location We stayed in this hotel from 30th October, 2008 to 1st November, 2008. We had two superior rooms. Location of the hotel is about 250 meters from Firenze Santa Maria Novella Railway station and similar distance from famous Duomo. Good restaurants and supermarket nearby. The hotel is best Western property with standard facilities. Restaurant on the 6th Floor terrace is well located and offer great view of Duomo. Breakfast is standard fare and nothing great. Internet at the reception is free. I will recommend this hotel for family with kids. With railway station located nearby, visit to Pisa becomes convenient. They have parking facility which comes handy. Overall good hotel in good location.

<Content>Great Hotel Find I was skeptical at first since Best Western's in NY are dumps but boy was I WRONG about Best Western International. The hotels are great ; I checked out a few in different cities in Italy and were extremely pleased with them.We stayed at this location using points from American Express Membership Rewards which we transferred into their hotel point program. We stayed 2 nights in Florence and would definitely stay again, free or not. As many said before, this hotel is located in the heart of everything you want to see. You have the Duomo 5 minutes walking, and if you use the Artiva Walking Tour (which was fantastic) they are just a block away from the hotel. The rooms were spotless, the bathroom was large and also spotless. The hotel room we stayed in had a small terrace which was nice too. There is a little cafe downstairs which had a super lunch for a reasonable price, the upstairs dining area had afternoon drinks and snacks and the morning complimentary breakfast too. The breakfast was the usual continental, good and filling.

<Content>Great Location, Great Rooms Great location- 2 minute walk to the beautiful Duomo and in walking distance to all the major sites. Rooms were very modern and clean- you can tell they were recently renovated. Bathrooms were really nice. Breakfast was excellent- very fresh, and very enjoyable from the rooftop. Compared to other hotels, the prices were very reasonable. The only criticism I have pertains to the front desk staff. They helped with directions when we asked but seemed bothered by our questions - we are tourists, so what do they expect?They didn't seem too pleased with assisting us with reservations or with suggesting sites. I expected more from a large hotel chain, and the staff was the most disappointing out of all our hotels during our 10 day trip.

<Content>Grat location Excellent location - right in the centre of Florence - a stone's throw from the main attractions. It was lovely having breakfast on the roof terrace, overlooking many of these attractions. Rooms were good quality - comfortable beds, good bathrooms and everything was very clean. The hotel rate of 170 euros a night was pretty steep but then, I guess you're paying for location. Other than that if felt like a good quality 3 star hotel and no more. Staff were pleasant and efficient.

<Content>Central location, good city break hotel We stayed here for 2 nights in mid June when the weather was a little cold. The hotel room was very clean and modern, and the bathroom was a generous size compared to other Italian hotels we have stayed in. The hotel is very close to the dome and main train station, which makes the hotel a good choice for a short break. I would describe the hotel as a good city break hotel but not sure I would recommend it for longer stays. I was a little disappointed with the breakfast as it was a little limited. The actual breakfast area is quite small, there are only a handful of tables inside and fewer outside on the rooftop, so in proportion the buffet food area is quite small. The hotel also has a cafe restaurant next door within the same building, good for a quick lunch.

<Content>location location Just back from a weekend in Florence and stayed at the Hotel Laurus, couldn't fault the hotel, rooms were very modern with excellent bathroom with complimentary shampoo, soap, shower hat etc replenished every day, tea and coffee making facilty(just call reception and porter will bring it up for you) also replenished with chocholate coffee milk cappuchino sugars etc every day.Hotel staff were very helpful and the roof top terrace was lovely for breakfast to be able to sit outside weather permitting.We were very lucky with the weather and sun shone everyday, this hotel is within walking distance of all the attractions and within walking distance of railway station (5-10 minutes walk).Depending on what you want to see and do I would reccomend Boboli Gardens and the Palace lots to see and do.I would reccomend this hotel for reasonable money and locality to everything.

<Content>Average First off let me say that the location was very good - almost right next to the Duomo and the room sizes were fairly good ..... They were the positives.Negatives (you may want to get some popcorn)The view we had from room 507 / 508 (can't exactly remember which number now) was that of a wall, and not of a particulary exciting wall at that either. I think it was yellow. The view from the roof terrace was not that much better, unless you happen to break the 8 foot barrier height wise which niether myself or my 5 foot girlfriend did or had in your possesion a step ladder, which she forgot to pack.The staff ....... Mmm, very average at best. Not very chatty, a bit weird looking maybe, didn't ask us about our stay or any of that malarky. We even got told off for drinking Champagne on the roof terrace when no other person was around. The reason. Health and Safety!!! .... This is Italy, they don't do Health and Safety, there's probably not even a word for it in Italian!!! - They just wanted us to buy their own Champagne me thinks, but I'm just guessing. Word of advice overall, don't pay for anything by credit card in Florence (or in Italy in general) if you can help it. I only used my card twice. Once at the cash point almost next to the Hotel (near the knickers and bra shop) and at a crappy rather expensive restuarant in the middle of the one of the squares (can't remember which one) and between them, I managed to get my card cloned . I cried like a little girl, it wasn't a pretty sight.If you have a choice of Hotel, then find somewhere else. If how ever you're like me and it was a present from your girlfriend / misstress what ever, then just smile, pretend you liked it and pat her on the head for making such an excellent and informed choice.Rant over.

<Content>Great location, spacious rooms. My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Premier Hotel Laurus in November 2007 for two days. We loved the hotel and highly recommend it to anyone thinking of staying there. The location is great, we didn't have to use public transport at all, and could easily cover all the main attractions in Florence by foot. It is literally steps away from the Duomo, and makes you feel in the thick of all the action in the city. The rooms were clean and spacious. The staff was efficient. They also had a decent continental breakfast. In summer you can make use of the outdoor seating on the terrace which has a great view of the Duomo. It is also at a walkable distance from the train station.

<Content>Ideal for city visit Just perfect for a city break when , in my view, you need comfort, convenience, value above other needs. We stayed 3 days over a long weekend. Great location between train/bus station and Duomo/shopping centre. 5 mins walk from station, 2 mins to Duomo, 10 mins walk to river. Spotless room in recently refurbished modern hotel. Comfy kingsize bed (2 singles). Decent breakfast - avoid the scrambled egg for sure but plenty of other choices and again very clean. We had breakfast on the roof top in February!Staff were very helpful - printing off details of train times from internet.We would stay again. We paid about GBP70 per night, double including breakfast, booking some months in advance, but I noticed it for about GBP50 a few days before we travelled. Fantastic value at 70.

<Content>Brilliant Position I was in Florence for a couple of nights to celebrate my birthday with three other friends (previously we spent two wonderful nights in Lucca) over New Year and had a wonderful time. The hotel was such a lovely surprise; near to the railways station (6 mins by foot) and the Duomo and main square 1 minute away - I could partially see it from my window. The rest of the usual tourist attractions were all within a 10 minute max walk away. Our room was very clean and very comfortable. All the usual mod cons, very quiet and very spacious. Breakfast was of excellent quality and plenty of it. Staff in the reception area were extremely helpful and always answered our many questions with a smile. They could not have done more for us. We were given maps every time poinpointing where we needed to head towards. Didn't try the hotel bar but was always busy and lively. The terrace has some fantastic views of Florence rooftops and the Duomo. If you haven't yet been to Florence I reccommend it especially away from the usual tourist invasion during the summer months. You will love the art, architecture, bars and restaurants, the people and the fabulous shopping. If you decide to go then stay at the Hotel Laurus you will enjoy your stay even more.

<Content>A great place to stay An excellent hotel with a great location. It was competitively priced and offered all we wanted. We were within walking distance of everything in the city, and it was very handy to drop off shopping or relax during the day if necessary! We found Florence a very safe city to walk around, even late at night.In a few days we were able to see all we wanted - the Duomo, the Academia, the Uffizi, Basilica san Croce (with the Christmas market in the San Croce piazza), the Medici Palace, the Ponte Vecchio, the Central Market, and climbed to the Piazzale Michelangiolo for a view of the city. Oh and don't forget the shops, with many small ones down little streets all over the city.Florence is expensive, but hunt around the back streets, especially across the river and you can find small cafes with great cooking at very reasonable prices. Even in December we were always asked if we wanted to sit outside - with heaters!One place not to miss is ' il Latini ' a brilliant restaurant, off Via della Vigna Nuova, Near Piazza Santa Tr铆nita - closed Mondays. Not cheap, but not over the top, and its an experience. Typical Tuscan cooking, but get there before 7.30pm or you won't get a seat, even though it has 5 eating areas in converted stables! You can choose from the menu, but usually you get sat at long tables (so interesting to see who you sit with) and the waiter tells you the choices. Go with it, its very good, but don't eat much all day before you go, as the portions are extremely generous.Anyway the Hotel Laurus was comfortable, warm and quiet. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a very comprehensive cold buffet: cereals, fruit salad, prunes, fresh fruit, breads, pastries, cold meats selection, cheese, yogurts, fruit juices, teas, coffees, make your own toast, jam, etc, etc - some warm foods: bacon, frankfurters and omelette. Our bathroom was a good size. Room was very clean and cleaned daily. No complaints at all.We booked directly with the hotel, as the price we were considering paying with one operator jumped up sharply when the airline prices went up. So we booked ourselves into the hotel over the net, and flew Easyjet, getting a much cheaper holiday.If you fly into Pisa, take the time to see the Leaning Tower - you can climb to the top for a great view. Have a great time.

<Content>Close to everything The Best Western Hotel Laurus in Florence was a very nice hotel. It reminded me the most of an American hotel of all the hotels I stayed in Italy, and that wasn't a terrible thing.There is a cute little cafe off the lobby and they had lots of good food. The rooftop terrace had a wonderful view and happy hour as well. They give you finger food for the price of a glass of wine (6 euro). The view of the Duomo from the terrace was lovely.We were near everything - a short walk from the Uffizi and Accademia, Ponte Vecchio, the Duomo, St. Maria Novella, and the train station. The room and bathroom were small, and they had a European hair dryer (like a vacuum cleaning attachment), so bring your own hairdryer.We didn't hear any noise outside except when there were police officers directing traffic - they use a whistle, and that grows tiresome after a while.I would recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Excellent experience My wife  I spent 3 nights at the Laurus. The hotel must have been refurbished recently, overall it looked fresh, clean and up-to-date. We had a room with a street view on the 3rd floor with a nice view of the city. The double windows do an excellent job of insulating the room from the street noise. The bathroom was immaculate, my wife claims it was the cleanest hotel bathroom she's ever seen. The room was very spacious with a king size bed, very comfortable and very clean. The free DSL internet connection worked perfectly, bring your own Ethernet cable or purchase one at the front desk for 3 Euros. At the roof top cafe they serve a very good buffet type European breakfast, great cappuccinos and espresso coffee. The Happy hour at the ground floor bar includes great snacks. The hotel is located very close to the Domo and the train station, walking distance to all museums, attractions and restaurants. The hotel staff was very helpful, some were friendly others not as friendly but all were courteous.We will definitely stay at the Laurus again when we return to Florence.

<Content>Great location We stayed in Florence for two nights on a trip around Italy. This hotel was in a great location to all the sights, and was especially handy as we arrived via train which was 200m away.The rooms were a good size and were light and airy. The room was comfortable, and looked almost new. The only downside of the room was that the sound insulation was not great, you could hear noise from the adjoining rooms and the corridor.The best thing about this hotel was the rooftop terrace, which had a lovely view of the Duomo. It was a great place to have breakfast and a relaxing drink at the end of the day. A great hotel for a Florence trip.

<Content>Great location, clean hotel, comfortable beds The hotel is definitely not anything fancy with only the most basic of amenities. Having said that, the location was great to everywhere we needed to go. It was also close enough to the train station that it wasn't a problem when we had to drag our heavy suitcases a couple of blocks. The breakfast was good - cold cuts, bread, cereals, fruit, and cappuccino made to order. If you're expecting a hot breakfast with fluffy scrambled eggs, thick bacon, this is not it (they had these odd egg squares, soggy bacon, and tiny sausages...not so tasty so I stayed away from it). If you have in mind that it's a light continental breakfast you won't be disappointed. The bedroom that we had was on the 3rd floor facing the street. It was a fairly large room (for Italy) and we had 2 twin beds (upon our request). Beds were comfortable, bathrooms were large and clean, there was a safe in the room, along with a nice closet space enough for 2 women. Sadly, I forgot to bring my cable for the free internet use but I was able to purchase one for 3 Euro. I couldn't dial out to make a phone call the first time I tried and the staff thought I was a complete idiot...that is, until I asked them if they had unlocked the phones for use from their main switchboard. Then after correcting the lock down (without apologies) they told me that I was ok to go. The service was only lukewarm but if you only need a clean and convenient place to rest your head and don't need too much help around the city, this is a great place to stay. I would definitely return to this hotel in the future, given the opportunity.

<Content>Great location, nice clean room! We've just returned from a fantastic trip to Florence and stayed for 5 nights at the Hotel Laurus. Our room was on the 7th floor (702) and had a lovely view of the city and San Lorenzo, you can also see the hills in the distance. The room was a good size and very clean. The room faced away from the street and we couldn't hear any noise from outside. The air conditioning was effective and appreciated!The location could not have been better - it's less than a 10 min walk to the station (SMN). In fact all the sights were also within a 10 min walk. Breakfast was ok, nothing special but the terrace makes up for this.The hotel doesn't have the personal touch of a family-run place but the reception was generally helpful. However, I would stay here again for the clean, spacious rooms and the fantastic location. Also worth getting a 7th floor room.Firenze has much to offer, we squeezed in a lot on our stay including a trip to beautiful Siena and Pisa but we would have loved to stay for longer. Recommend Bella Donna for an authentic Italian meal. We reserved tickets for the Uffizi and the Accademia using the museum's direct phone number (it's on their website) - there is an English speaking operator and it just costs 3 Euros in addition to the ticket price. This was infinitely better than queuing for hours and was much cheaper than the private websites.

<Content>Central, great value We stayed at this hotel for a week during August as part of our honeymoon. It ws an excellent choice for the moderate rate being just a few steps from the Duomo on a main street within easy walk of the train station.The first thing we noticed was how clean our room was. It was very pleasant to return to a clean tidy room each day. From the window of our room you could look out and see the Duomo and the streets bustling with tourists all night long (Luckily the double glazing seemed to keep the noise out).The staff were very helpful and booked us somewhere (excellent) to eat on our first night when we arrived late. It was a good choice and literally just across the road - Piaza d'Olio.Breakfast was served on the lovely roof terrace from which there are nice views of the Duomo and surrounding buildings. It was a simple continental affair but had enough choice to keep us happy. Make sure you get up early if you want to sit out on the terrace wihtout a wait!

<Content>Sewer Backup Smell I am a travel agent who decided to stay at this hotel because of its location and roof top resturant. The location is fabulous, the breakfast is horrible, and my room smelled the entire stay of backup sewerage which made me sick to my stomach and difficult to sleep at night. I informed the hotel, but all they did was air out the room and refused to change my room. This made my stay totally unpleasant not to mention that the room was expensive as well. The rooftop restaurant had a fabulous view, but the food was almost unedible except for the fresh loaves of bread. The eggs were made in a brownie pan and cut in slices. They did not even taste like eggs. The meats were all fat, the sausage was small hot dogs, and the bacon was hardly cooked laden with grease and fat. I would NEVER stay their again or recommend it to my clients. There was Sofitel next door that has a hot buffet breakfast. Do not waste your money or your experience in such a lovely city by staying at this hotel.

<Content>Room with a View We stayed here 22nd  23rd June having spent the previous night in Pisa. Having read all recent TA reviews we saw that rooms 701  703 were highly recommended, being on the top floor, so we requested either of these. We arrived at the hotel after a short walk from the Train/Coach Station and were allocated room 703 as per our request, which was at the rear of the hotel. Room 701 is on the front of the Hotel with it's own balcony. 703 is a quiet room, with windows looking out over the red tiles of the city and the mountains in the distance - beautiful views and sunsets, beautiful modern furnished room and bathroom. Breakfast on the terrace was fantastic, as were the early evenings pre dinner with a drink or two and extensive complementary buffet (Recommended !). Following dinner at local Restauruants we returned here and had a bottle of wine etc. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Overall, an excelent hotel, close to most of the main attractions, and within an easy walk of the others - bridge  river etc. A memorable short break in a fantastic city. The climb to the top of the Dome is well worth the effort !

<Content>Excellent value, great location I stayed at the Hotel Laurus in May 2007 and would very much recommend this hotel for value, comfort, and location. Out of all the hotels I stayed at in Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome, the Laurus had the largest room and was the cheapest. I prepaid four nights on their website at 185 euros and that was 100 euros cheaper than my other italian hotels. So it was great value.When we got to the hotel the front desk clerk said she was giving us a nice room. We've heard that before, but she was right! The room was excellent. Top floor (6), large bedroom, small sitting area around the corner, large bathroom, and a private patio with view. Very pleasantly surprised.The hotel has a very nice breakfast room on the top floor, and they were the only hotel to serve a hot breakfast (eggs and sausages). Every other hotel just had croissants, cereal, fruit and cheeses. The breakfast room was also the bar in the evenings and it was pleasant to sit out there and enjoy a beer.The location is outstanding if you arrive by train (I highly recommend travelling by train in Italy - fast, efficient, no airport hassles). It is an easy 5-10 minute walk from the station to the hotel. As you exit the hotel, walk past the large Santa Maria Novella church on the left, keep walking as the street bends a bit to the left. That is the street the hotel is on (Cerratani) and it is only a block or two along. (Alternatively, take the tunnel from inside the station which takes you under the busy street and out a little further down towards the hotel.Florence compared to Rome is much easier to walk around and the Laurus is well situated for all Florence sights. It is only a five minute walk to the Duomo, and maybe fifteen minutes to the Uffizi and Accademy Gallery and Ponte Vecchio. We walked everywhere around Florence, even up to the top of Piazale Michelangelo (recommended for the great city views).The Uffizi is excellent but you should seriously consider booking in advance through Select Italy. Same with the Accademy gallery. The lines are huge although I suspect they lessen later in the afternoon after the tour groups go through.The Santa Maria Novella church is worth a visit, as is the Basilica di San Lorenzo which is not too far away. We took a bus tour to Siena and San Gimignano which I highly recommend. Both cities are amazing.Lots of restaurants to choose from. We ate at Sabbatini, which is about halfway between the hotel and the train station. Sabbatini is upscale, a little formal but has a very nice interior, and serves authentic florentine food. It was very good if you want something a bit better class than most of the streetside pizzerias which are hit and miss.And Buca Lapi was excellent as well if you want a nice but bit pricy meal. It is close to the hotel but a bit hard to find so you will need a good map or some help. It is downstairs in a basement and has a nice atmosphere with travel posters pasted to the walls and ceiling. They make an excellent (and HUGE) florentine steak. Meal for two with a bottle of wine was 150 euros.All in all, a great city and the Laurus is the perfect place to stay.

<Content>I Would Definitely Return We stayed here for 4 nights in Apr 2007. Location is smack in the middle of everything - Duomo a few hundred feet to the left, Santa Maria Novella Train station less than 1/2-mi to the right. Room was extremely pleasant, modern, clean, quiet (with the double-pane windows closed) and had a stunning view of the duomo, another smaller church, and the hillsides of the Oltrarno in the distance. Pleasant roof terrace for breakfast and bar in the evenings.Rooms and bathrooms have clearly been updated recently and are very well-kept - I am a picky traveler and would easily put this on par with many of the much more expensive 5* properties I've stayed in for work. The public areas (lobby) are a little shabbier and dated but all I care about is a clean room. My only other minor beef is that the front desk staff is a bit surly which depended who was on duty at the time, but that seems to be the case in much of Italy.All in all, I'd come back and stay here in a heartbeat.

<Content>Fab location to explore from If you're going to Florence and want a central base to explore from you probably cannot get much better than this. The Medici Chapel is at the back of the hotel (5mins max away) and the Duomo/Giotto's Tower is a stones throw. The Uffizzi (pre book to avoid wasting time in ques), Ponte Vecchio, Bargello, Boboli Gardens are all within walking distance.The hotel has recently been refurbished is clean and spacious. The breakfast is good with a roof top terrace  view of the Duomo.The staff are very helpful and polite.There are a variety of eateries on the same road, and for those in need of shopping therapy while on holiday - you don't have to walk too far to that either (across the road!).A good hotel, not much Florean charm as it is a modern business hotel really, but a cracking central location. 10 min walk to the railway station - ideal spot for exploring from.

<Content>Good Hotel in Florence We stayed here three nights in March, 2007.We had orignially reserved a city-view room (facing south and the street Via Cerretani). It was 70 deg F and sunny when we got to Florence and it was very warm in the room so they switched us to a room facing the back (north with a view of the Medici Chapel) which was quiet, sort of:The hotel has a conference center and lecture/concert hall on the ground floor. There are 6 medium size A/C units on the roof of the facility below the north-facing rooms which were running on-and-off while we were there . The noise from these, especially for those on the lower floors, might be a problem. We had the windows open while there (which also let in a few mosquitos) and the A/C was not on in the rooms yet.The breakfast was good with an excellent selection. Other reviewers mentioned the scrambled eggs and cold cuts. The cold cuts and cheese were excellent and the scrambled eggs are made this way all over Europe.It pays to check the room rates on the BW site before traveling. I made the reservations in May 2006 and the rate was 173 Euro. I checked the week before leaving and the rate was only 123 Euro.Overall the Laurus is a bargain in an expensive town like Florence.

<Content>Mostly a great experience Wish I could have had some of the amenities and furniture in my room that some of y'all had, but I had no complaints about my room and was grateful the hotel staff honored my request for a quiet room facing the rear of the hotel. My top-floor room had a fantastic view of the Medici Chapel and the mountains.I agree with all the positive stuff in previous reviews. Had just one bad experience: A few days before my stay, my wallet was stolen in Rome. I had to cancel the credit card I used to guarantee my upcoming stay at the Laurus. When the Laurus tried to run my credit card for authorization two days before my check-in, it was rejected.They sent me an e-mail that said I had a few hours to submit a new credit card or they would cancel my reservation. They, and Best Western, had two phone numbers for me.I didn't call in time, but I was able to talk them into keeping my reservation once I faxed them a new credit-card number. The upshot: I would definitely call the hotel and confirm reservations.I'd stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Hotel -- great location! Most of the positive reviews for this hotel I can vouch for, with exception of the morning breakfast which I felt could have been better. The hot items like eggs and breakfast could have been better quality, and the cheeses/salami/ham needed to be replaced! (tasted on the edge)As for the rooms, appreciated the quiet room in the back. Heated towel racks, nice size bathroom, and in room safe made a big difference for the 3 nights I stayed here.Location is awesome...... a few steps away from the duomo, Piazza San Lorenzo, and the Train Station.4/5 stars.

<Content>Best hotel we ever stayed in in Italy We selected this hotel based on previous tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed during hour week-long stay at the end of 2006. We can only agree with all the positive feedback given so far: Excellent location, very quiet, spacious and clean room and bathroom, well-equipped (SAT TV, free in-room broadband, if you have your own laptop or pay www station in the lobby, huge and most comfortable bed ever, desk with 2 chairs, coffee table with comfy arm chair, efficient A/C / heating), coffee/tea making facilities in the room, good breakfast buffet, lovely terrace). Staff are friendly.Hard to think of anything negative to say. Maybe the hot breakfast is not the best ever, but try to find decent scrambled eggs anywhere in Italy :)We booked their early-bird special: non-refundable, but great savings (approx. 15% off).Unbeatable and best hotel we had on any of our many trips to Italy and first time we've even given a 5-star feeback!

The area has great shops and boutiques and we could not help noticing the more expensive Sofitel was just doors away. The hotel also has a great breakfast area on top which overlooks the Duomo. The room was nice and generously sized. We highly recommend it.

<Content>Simply fantastis I stayed at the Best Western Hotel Laurus in Florence, IT in September 2006 for four nights. This hotel was simply the best hotel hotel I had during my entire three weeks stay in Italy. The hotel is fantastic....centrally located, across the street from the Duomo, a few blocks from the bridge and five minutes of walk from the train station. Rooms a a great size, clean, modern with windows you can open. The bathrooms were large and perfectly clean. Even LCD TV in the room. The have a patio for breakfast with a niew of Duomo and the breakfast choices is plentiful. Also, the bar is open at night to enjoy the moonlight. Staffs were great, helpful, smiling and even play the role of tourist guide as needed. The rates were competitve.Simply, If I return to Florence one day, Laurus is my choice. Simply a perfect stay.

This is a green hotel which sacrifices nothing to comfort and service. The room was large and at the front - very comfortable. The staff were helpful, if not over-friendly. Breakfast was good. A 15 minute walk to the train station was a blessing. An excellent hotel - great value.

Got ourselves moved to the top of the building at the back (Room 703) - light, airey, spacious and great view over the roof tops to distant mountains. Also very handy for breakfast on the 6th Floor - out on a patio; delightful.Great hotel, great location, geat value.As far as shopping is concerned - be warned 'the plastic' will take a serious bashing - if not maimed for life. Sticking to the cultural visits is a lot cheaper!

The rooms and bathroom were amazing. You can even have breakfast outside on the roof terrace. We loved this hotel and it was a perfect birthday treat for my mrs to be. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay here again.

<Content>As good as reviewed by others - a great place to stay We stayed 5 nights in October 2006, having booked directly with the hotel from the UK ([--]). We had a superior room with breakfast and balcony for euro 178 per night. This proved to be a very good deal.The hotel has a very central location and none of the major attractions are more than a 10/12 minute walk. You could not get more central. The Laurus is nothing special to look at from the outside, and it could be anywhere in the world. Although located on a busy road, the sound proofing was excellent and noise was never a problem. Both rooms were spotless clean, and the bathrooms were 1st class. Room service was very efficient and unobtrusive.The staff at the reception were most helpful in booking admissions to the Uffizi, the Academia and the Bargello. We also booked with them a concert and a day trip to Sienna. We would recommend the use of the reception for booking as it reduces the need for very long waiting.Breakfast was buffet style and there was an excellent selection, though it could get a little busy at certain times.Overall, this proved to be an excellent choice and we would thoroughly recommend this hotel to others.Well done to all the staff at the Laurus who made our stay so enjoyable.

<Content>Nice accomodation in bustling city We had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Laurus for six nights in early October.The room was modern and clean with a very nice bathroom. You can't beat it for the price. The staff were helpful and friendly. We especially enjoyed Claudio, the bartender at Bar American. The view from the rooftop deck was nice. It was an especially nice place to go at the end of the night to get away from the crowds of tourists everywhere else but enjoy the nice view and terrific weather. The location is very convenient - walking distance to most sights and the train station.It is, however, on a very busy road which is also apparently the main route to the hospital. Traffic noise, and especially the ambulances, did get tedious after a couple days and nights.Breakfast was adequate and the outside terrace was a nice way to start the morning. They had really nice fruit, but after the first day we started noticing fruit flies swimming in it so we had to stop eating it after that. The selections didn't vary at all from day to day so by day 6 it was old to us. The bed was too hard for our taste, but we had the same issue in Venice, so given that this was our first trip to Italy, we guess this may just be the norm.The only real negative we encountered was with the reservation desk. We had requested in advance for them to book a private guide for a specific tour we wanted to do. They confirmed the booking as we requested. It was not an inexpensive trip and we had really looked forward to it as a highlight of our visit to Tuscany. We were very disappointed in the service we received from the driver, Mr. Tiziano, (far more a driver than a guide) and he didn't fulfill our requested itinerary. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, I felt that the reservation manager did not act as my advocate.

<Content>A good ending to a fabulous holiday! We found this hotel after a nasty surprise at Hotel Pendini where we had a reservation. Our room there was not kept because of a credit card that was allegedly declined (and was accepted the same day at Laurus!). This hotel was a pleasant surprise.The location was great and it has all the modern conveniences. One is often tempted to stay in the older, historical hotels in Florence, but after battling up more than one staircase to get to reception, one realizes that it is more convenient to stay in a modern hotel with all the mod cons like the Laurus, especially at the end of your trip! You can park in front of the hotel to offload luggage and they have an agreement with a nearby parking garage if you should need it. This hotel is within walking distance to all the tourist attractions in Florence.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great location, reasonably priced. I stayed at the Hotel Laurus on the 31st August. I booked the hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. What a lovely hotel! The rooms were large, modern and clean. All are eqipped with Satellite television, minibar and safe. The bathrooms are roomy and equipped with bath/shower, bidet etc. The shower was excellent. Most impressive of all were the complimentary slippers, toothbrush etc. The hotel provided everything you could conceiveably need.Having spent the previous 4 days in Rome staying in a fairly basic hotel (which cost the same as the Laurus) I was seriously impressed with the quality of the Laurus. Great value for money.Breakfast was very good,wide range of food and wonderful roof terrace. The location was ideal - very central, near to the station and all the main tourist sights.The only slight negative was the fairly cool welcome we received from the bearded receptionist - he was very reserved to say the least. However, that said, all of the other staff were friendly and helpful.Re room rates, we booked the hotel directy through the Best Western website as we couldn't find a better deal. The price was excellent - 115 Euro for a Kingsize room with city views. I would definitely stay in this hotel again!

<Content>Fabulous Firenze The location is superb, just 200 metres from the Duomo. We stayed in early September when temperatures were still about 34C but the air conditioning was perfect. Our room and bathroom were immaculate and as an extra surprise we had a balcony. It was on the 6th floor and just opposite the bar/roof terrace area and next to the lift however the door was clearly soundproofed as we couldn't hear anything when it was shut. The roof terrace where you can have breakfast is an excellent way to start your day gazing at the Duomo or flicking through a complimentary newspaper. Staff were very pleasant. And if you make that extra effort to speak a few words of Italian they seem even more friendly. Without a doubt we would stay here again.

<Content>Good Location, NO PARKING Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during my visit to Florence. Arriving at the hotel was very difficult, because we rented a car during our vacation in Tuscany, and cars are not allowed to circulate in the centre of Florence. whn we managed to find a paking lot, we had to walk to the hotel with our luggage. this is a very frenetic city - lots and lots of turists, so its nt easy to get around. the hotel was nice, the rooms very clean and big, breakfast was very good. the staff though, was not very nice. breakfast was opend untill 10:30, and when we arrived at 10:05, the staff wasnt pleased to see us. i found that in all bustling cities in Italy (Florence, Rome, Milan) the staff at the hotels are not nice at all.in anycase, should you be arriving in Florence by train, or plane, I do reccommend this hotel. should you be arriving by car, be prepared to pay 40鈧?a night just for parking your car!!!!

<Content>Fantastic Location I've been meaning to write a review on this hotel since staying there with a friend in July. The hotel is in a fantastic location just up the road from the fabulous Duomo. The room we had was beautifully decorated, immaculately clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was very contemporary with a huge basin, shower over the bath, wc and bidet. The rooms are air conditioned which is essential as temperatures in July were in the high 90's.The best thing about the hotel has to be the upstairs terrace, in the morning you can eat breakfast in the sun overlooking the Duomo and later after a hard day sightseeing you can relax up there with a cool drink and complimentary nibbles, perfect! I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again if I return to Florence.

<Content>Lauds for Laurus My family was thrilled to walk into this hotel...after a long, hot journey by train, we were greeted by the smiling staff and a gloriously air-conditioned lobby! Our room was perfect, our son had his own private side with a comfortable sofa/sleeper. My husband had internet, and I had a clean, modern room with a generously sized bath. We had a thermostat, and the air conditioning level was a welcome relief! As mentioned, the breakfast room overlooks the Duomo, and the food was above average. We got a terrific deal on Venere, and would stay at the Laurus again.

<Content>Great location... Stayed at the Hotel Laurus for 4 nights. The Hotel is well situated close to the Rail Termini and only a few minutes walk to the Hotel. As prevously mentioned the Hotel has recently been refurbished with nice bright decor. Rooms are quite spacious with a nice bathroom.The 6th floor Breakfast Room with it's balcony terrace was lovely. This room was also the bar for drinks during the day and evening. The Hotel is within walking distance off all the major attractions in Florence with the Dumo less than 5 mins walk and visible from the terrace. Streets are quite noisy outside Hotel but double glazed windows shut out the noise. Rooms are air conditioned.As expected Florence was very busy and hot but plenty of places to grab a cool beer. The Restaurants we dined at were superb, we particulalry liked the Trattoria Il Caminetto in via Dello Studio a little road just off the Dumo Square. Not cheap for sure but the food and service well worth the money.Prior to this stay we had just spent 4 nights in Rome and travelled to Florence by rail. We enjoyed Rome which of course is renowned for it's Historical interest whereas Florence was very much about it's culture but both very interesting places to visit.

<Content>Nice room, Great location Stayed here 18 May through 22 May 2006. Arrived via train, about an hour and half journey from Rome. When you exit the train station, you should go down to the underground walkways to get to Via de Panzani. Via De Panazni will turn into Via de Cerretani which is the street the hotel is on. It's about a 10 minute walk from the train station.The hotel was better than I expected. The room was spotless, good sized and very well appointed. Our room looked out at the dome of San Lorenzo which we initially mistakened for the Duomo.For views of the Duomo, the hotel's rooftop breakfast room/bar can't be beat. It's a great way to start the day. Breakfast was good with deli meats, cheeses, pastries, cereal, scrambled eggs, juices, milk and coffee.As it is with many European hotels, the elevators are painfully small; barely fits 3 people comfortably.The staff was OK. Helpful when seeking assistance, but nothing above and beyond.Location is EXCELLENT! Some key sites are easily within walking distance. Exit the hotel and turn left down the sidewalk and it's a 2 minute walk to the Duomo.If you're looking at the front of the Duomo, on the left hand side there's a side street called Via Ricassoli which leads you to the Galleria dell Accademia and the statue of David; about a 5-10 minute walk. It'll be on your right hand side. I only say this becaus the buildling is less than impressive and easy to miss.If you walk across the plaza between the Duomo and the Baptistry, you'll find a side street called Via de Calzaiuoli. This will lead you to the Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio; about a 10 minute walk. Watching the sunset on Ponte Vecchio was quite memorable.Was also able to easily do a day trip to Pisa; about a 45 minute train ride. In May 2006, a 2nd class train ticket to Pisa was 11 euros roundtrip. I would not recommend paying for first class. The ride isn't long enough and not all trains offer first class, yet the machines will let you purchase first class tickets even if it doesn't exist. Save first class for the long haul trips.There were even day trips via bus to Vencie. Venice was our next stop, so we didn't take advantage of this.Dining and shopping opportunities abound. Some upscale shopping boutiques were just steps away and there was an outlet center shuttle service that was being offered. There were also numerous restaurants and gelato shops to be found.If you choose to wash your own clothes at a self-service laundromat, there is one that is relatively close. It's location escapes me, but you might be able to ask the front desk staff. It was very popular with the English speaking crowd and there was a nice bar across the street where you can sip on a drink or grab a bite to eat as you wait for your clothes to finish. In May 2006, it was 3.50 euros to wash and 3.50 euros to dry. It took a little over an hour to wash and dry.With good rooms and a central location, this hotel is a great choice for under 200 euros a day. I would definitely recommend it. In fact, the man who checked out of the hotel immediately before me told the hotel clerk that he would recommend it too.

<Content>Great Location My wife and I stayed at the Laurus for a couple of nights as a birthday treat for her.The location was fantastic. Easy walking distance of the station and Il Duomo and all the other attractions. The room was very clean and very well appointed. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly - particularly Claudio on the rooftop bar who was very keen to show off his cocktail-making skills. We were only too happy to be guinea pigs for him!I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the beds being too hard. A minor gripe and it didn't spoil our enjoyment. Despite being so centrally located we were not at all bothered by traffic noise - I think due to the excellent double glazing the room had. Breakfast was basic but being able to eat on the rooftop terrace was fantastic. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

The hotel location was superb - 2 mins to the Duomo and we couldn't believe the view we had of this landmark as we munched down our lovely free breakfast, which was simple but more than adequate.2 massive thumbs up! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel...One more thing, we were in Florene for 3 days and felt like we had seen all we wanted to as it is not a large city and you can just wander around and absorb most of it - so we went on a day trip to Rome! on our last day. We didn't think this was feasible, but the high speed train only took and hour and a half and I feel like we got two holidays in one! We just decided this the night before so it cost 60 euros but I'm sure if you book the train in advance it would be cheaper. Enjoy!

<Content>Gorgeous views, perfect position Can't agree more with the previous two reviewers. The hotel is in a great position and the views from the room and breakfast room are beautiful.The only thing we found was that the beds were rather hard but that may be personal preference.Everything else was perfect and we were very pleased we chose this hotel to stay in for our long weekend away.

<Content>Just what any traveller wants and needs Arrived in Florence via train and walked towards the Duomo. Best Western was right there - great entry and very nice staff, with a bell guy for your bags! Wasn't expecting that...Great room, small but nicely furbished with a very nice bathroom and flat screen TV with Satellite channels in many different languages. The hotel includes a great continental bufffet breakfast on the top floor with a balcony that has great views of the Duomo and parts of the city. The breakfast room is converted to a bar room for evening service and was open for us until about 11pm I believe.The location of the hotel is great - very close to mostly all of the sites: Duomo is RIGHT THERE! Easy check out and quick walk back to the train station.We stayed there 4 nights this past Feb 2006 - I would reccomend this hotel to anyone travelling to Florence and will stay there again.

<Content>Excellent Stayed at this hotel Feb 06, very close to train station and within 100 metres of The Duomo. All the rooms are refurbished and we had a separate lounge tothe bedroom both with flat screen TVs!!!Breakfast was lovely on the 6th floor overlooking Florence. Could not fault the hotel at all. Highly recommended.

<Content>Comfortable room, good location and value Florence is small, so it's not difficult to find a hotel that is within walking distance of all the major sites, but it was nice to be a short walk from the train station and on a major street that did not feel claustrophobic. Even though the neighborhood is quite nice, beware, there are plenty of pickpockets in the area (as we found out first hand).The room was sized comfortably with a comfortable bed, but the bathroom was a bit cramp and only had a small shower.One bonus is the excellent breakfast which is served on the sixth floor. They have a wonderful terrace from which one can see the Duomo.

<Content>Very nice for the money. Good central location. Front-desk staff speaks English, helpful. Made a dinner recommendation and reservation for us; one of our best dinners in Italy! Rooms were spacious, clean. Bar on upper level, could sit outside. Breakfast better than average (cereal, meats, bread, cheeses). Highly recommend Hotel Laurus, especially for the money.

<Content>Nice and Central We stayed here for 2 nights and were pleased with our choice. Although I did not find the staff to be very helpful (not sure the barman knew what his job description was), noone was especially rude and think it may just be typical of a tourist overwhelmed town. The hotel was clean and recently renovated. The bathrooms were marble and the rooms were modern with very effective double glazing. The outside patio on the 5th floor (or was it 6th?) would have been fab for a sunset cocktail if the barman had wanted to serve us.......but was lovely for breakfast. It has a central location and I think offered good and reliable value for money. I would definately stay at this hotel again as while it may lack charm, there is a lot to be said for good, clean, modern comforts!
