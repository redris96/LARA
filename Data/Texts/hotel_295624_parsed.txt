<Content>Clean and Friendly Budget 3 star Hotel We arrived by Terravision bus from Pisa airport to Santa Maria Novelli station at the end of Jan this year. Locals were friendly and directed us to the hotel which was central for getting to all the sights in Florence.Although up 3 flights of stairs/or lift whichever you prefer. The staff were friendly and helpful our room was very clean and spacious including the bathroom, toiletries incl. and towels, clean linen on bed which was comfortable, plenty of wardrobe space etc and writing desk. New decor, Good food choices to start the day from cereal, fruit, yoghurts, meats, pastries, good coffee etc. Very friendly waiting staff. A pretty breakfast room in italiano style although small. Plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby for an evening meal. We will return even though it rained most of the time we were there. I prefered Florence to Rome the shops/markets are wonderful and got a few bargains as the sales were on. The Ponte Vecchio bridge, The Michaelangelo Piazzo, The Duormo, the basillicas, the artists, the gardens, the galleries, the gelati - such a choice. Can't wait to go back....

<Content>Rather nice, but needs updating in the rooms Found Hotel Andrea on web-site WORLDBY.COMBudget hotel on the third floor of apartment building and easy to find using their web-site map. The staff is friendly and able to assist with almost any situation or problem.The rooms need updating in the worst way, though. They are Soviet Union style decor. Basic hodge-podge of furniture that has seen better days in the gulag. Ask for room 209 or 210. They front the park and that gives you the ROOM WITH A VIEW view. Room 208 is a teeny-tiny monk-like cell that is depressing to the point of wanting to jump out the window and end it all!Breakfast is very good and they've really tried to make the entire place hospitable and warm. For the money it's a good buy but everything in Italy is WAY OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!There is a somewhat complicated Internet service. By the minute, day (entire length of stay ) or upfront charge.

<Content>Dirty Hotel It's a very dirty hotel! There're at least 10 mosquitoes in the bathroom when we walked in. We complained to the reception and she told us to plug in the bug repellent which is underneath the bedside table. Obviously the bug repellent is extremely dirty and dusty too. What's worse is there's no water, including flushing water for the toilet on our first arrival night. No shower or flushing toilet! This hotel is located in a very old building on the 3rd floor. Hygiene is definitely a problem within the hotel. It is also far from everywhere, more than 15 mins. from train station and far from all major sightseeing areas. Watch out unless you have no option to other hotels.

<Content>Good value hotel We were looking for a nice 3 star hotel in a good location and found it. This is a small family hotel with a very nice staff. The rooms were clean with a lovely view of the city. Breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful. Florence is not a large city and the hotel has easy walking access to most places of interest.Recommended.

<Content>Such a nice place in Florence From the moment we entered this small hotel, everything was jus great. Our hostess was helpful, charming and the room we had booked offered us all the comforts we were hoping for in a hot summer week.We started each day with a nice breakfast and enjoyed Tuscany to its fullest. THe hotel is within easy reach of the many beautiful sights of Florence.Florence is beautiful and we were delighted by our overall experience

<Content>Enjoyed this budget hotel. Good value in Florence. We stayed here 4 days in early June. I rate the Andrea excellent, but that should be taken in context: this is a budget hotel. If you are used to expensive hotels, look elsewhere, but if you want to get good value for your money in Florence - and that's not easy - read on.The location is NOT 200 meters from the train station as they say. We wrestled with our wheeled luggage along the crowded streets because we believed that figure; it was more like 700 or 800 meters. It was walkable since there are no hills, but I'd now recommend taking a taxi from the train station. Florence is a walkable city, so if you are in good shape and can take the heat during summer, you can walk to most main attractions. City buses (oddly designed with few seats) go everywhere, but be careful which direction you travel. From the bus stops near the hotel, you could easily end up in the suburbs. Consider Florence's special bus passes for 24 hrs, 3 days, etc.The hotel is on a nice little park away from traffic noises. By the way, the park has a great little fruit stand at the opposite corner for late night watermelon or beer! On the upper of the two floors of the hotel (3rd and 4th floors from the street), we did not hear any noise except the maid cleaning.The room was starkly furnished, but clean and cool - good air conditioning. (In summer, A.C. is the most important feature of any hotel in Florence. ) The beds and pillows were comfortable. There was a small fridge under the tiny TV.The staff was very friendly and helped us make reservations without hesitation. The continental breakfast was sparse, but good coffee and good service with a smile. You can pay for internet service in the lobby for a reasonable amount...check their rate for your entire stay. The hotel is secure and I didn't sense any problem with the neighborhood, safety-wise. We enjoyed dinner at a local restaurant, Jimmys, but the meal we had a Guelfo was not pleasant because it was too hot in that non-air conditioned restaurant.Be aware that the hotel's rooms vary greatly in size. Not all rooms look like what they show on websites, and not all rooms have a good view. The strangest thing about our room was the bathroom, long and super narrow with a shower that did not have any walls, just curtains between the sink and bidet. This created puddles on the bathroom floor and made it very slippery to walk. We wrote it off to local color. When that's the worse thing you can say about a budget hotel, it's an excellent' place to stay.

<Content>Great location Just realised I didn't post anything after the stay last year.Stayed in June 2006, really hot weather at the time, didn't drop below 36 during the day, but hotel was clean with good a/c so it was comfortable during the night.Hotel was great for the cost and location with a really good breakfast and helpful staff. Being in Italy during the world cup (soccer for the americans) and walking around central Florence and hearing the cheers when Italy scored was great.Loadsof great places to eat all within a short walk of the hotel and if it is hot then the water melon stall on the same piazza as the hotel is well worth a visit.Take a bus trip to Sienna if you've got time, about 1 1/2 hours on the coach.Would stay again at the hotel.

<Content>Wanna save money, but be in a decent location Enjoyed Hotel Andrea. Small boutique hotel within walking distance from the train station. Also walking distance to the markets, but what am I saying everything is in walking distance in Florence. Hotel offers laptops in room with internet browsing for an additional charge. I brought my laptop but was able to access the wireless network. Small fee will be chargeed, but you can pay by the hour, daily or weekly rate. Hotel also offers continental breakfast for no additional charge. Felt totally safe in this hotel, furnishings are average, nothing to write home about, but the bathroom was really clean, albeit small. Overall this hotel is recommended for travelers that don't plan to spend alot of time in their rooms and who want to save money for all the wonderful shopping there is in Firenze!The next time I visit Tuscany I would stay in this hotel.

<Content>Great Value friendly staff beatiful city My partner and I go away every January for weekend break, we decided after having such a good time in Milan last year to go to Italy again and this time we chose Florence, after much deliberating we decided to book this hotel and were not dissapointed. The location was very central and close to all the sites Duomo etc. We found the hotel very easily and were met by very friendly staff ( a huge contrast to last year). The staff never spoke a lot of English but enough to make us welcome and we were in Italy after all. The breakfast is sufficient and sets you up for the day, a lady serves the coffee etc. at your table and again was very friendly. The hotel is part of an apartment block and made the hotel even more appealing, there was a 24hr manned reception and a security entrance that was opperated by them. Florence was beautiful and if we were to return to Florence we would deffinately go back to the Andrea

<Content>Noisy Hotel, Decent Location, but clean NOT WRITTEN BY HOTEL - EXTREMEMLY HONESTROOM: larger than most in Italy. Clean. Adequate. Not the Ritz...not a hostel. The room is situated with the others on the same floor as the front desk. It's actually only feet away. That means that when the front desk phone rings in the middle of the night, you're going to wake up. A huuuuge pain in the [--]. The walls are so think that any conversation in the adjacent rooms sound as if they're in your own room. NOt a good thing.BATHROOM: not very clean. toilet didn't flush properly. The bathtum was grimy.BREAKFAST: pretty good. your standard italian breakfast. poor cappuchino, but the food was pretty tasty.LOCATION: Decent. It's about a ten minute walk to get to anything of interest. Not bad though. After all, you're in FLorence.STAFF: Very friendly. And Accomodating.

<Content>Good location  Stayed here in a quad room which was generously sized with an ample bath. The breakfast is basic with fruit, rolls, pastries and coffee, juice and tea. The reception is available 24hrs and was staffed with nice, helpful people. I thought the location was a bit tucked away (although that can also be a positive for less street noise) but still within walking distance to everything. The surrounding areas get a little rough looking at night but is still considered safe by the locals. This is a good hotel and basic value.

<Content>Loved it! Me and a couple of friends stayed here just recently and i can honestly say i would go back there. The hotel is quaint, and the staff friendly. Our room was small-ish but comfotable and we didnt spend much time in there anyway as we went 'exploring' every day. The whole package was great, it was a good price and the surrounding are was great with lots of things going on. Also, you can walk EVERYWHERE, which is a bonus. we found we didnt need to use public transport at all, its not needed unless you go to a neighboring town or going to the airport (in which case you NEED a taxi). It was also great to have the markets so near, and before you know it, you are speaking italian without even realising it. Once you get home you are sure to incopporate Ciao and grazi into your vocabulary.Highly Reccomended!!

<Content>Great Hotel We had a lovely stay at the Hotel Andrea in Florence. Good location, on Piazza Independenza a 10-15 minute walk to the Duomo, and 10-15 walk to the train station. But the views from the double rooms of the park in the piazza and the Duomo in the distance were lovely. The room was the largest and most well appointed on our trip (Rome, Florence and Venice) and the breakfast was the most varied with hard boiled eggs and meats in addition to the usual rolls, croissants, etc. that make up an Italian breakfast.Best of all was the most reasonable price! 80 Euros for a lovely double with a good size bathroom in mid-March. Will definitely come back to this hotel again.

<Content>Hotel rooms are cold in November!! The hotel was satisfactory, the only thing I would say is the room was cold! the heater was on but it did little to warm the room and you would not have known it was on at all! anytime I was in the room I had to climb into the bed! I asked for a few more blankets which they gave me. The reason I stayed here was that it was at a good price and I would stay again for the same reason! Not in winter though!

<Content>which hotel.. Andrea Hotel, Florence ItalyDate :- 13/08/2005Sue and Lynne.. Portsmouth U.K.Which hotel were these reviewers staying at.. because it certainly was not the same one we did. The Andrea Hotel deserves its 3 stars. From the moment we arrived we were treated brilliantly the staff went out of their way to make our holiday great. It was old but very clean and had an old world charm about it which was in perfect keeping with Florence city. And being located in the city centre was an added bonus with every thing easily within walking distance or a short bus ride. I would go back again and recommend you give it a try. Happy Holiday.

<Content>Good and tiny Room was very small, bathroom even smaller, but everything was clean. Location was convenient (5-min walk from the Santa Maria Novella station), but often some sketchy people in the piazza where Hotel Andrea is located. Florence is rather small, so you can pretty much walk everywhere from the hotel. Breakfast was good; the lady serving lattes was kind and efficient. Only stayed there for two nights, but I swear I never saw the same person behind the reception desk during our stay. The staff's English was rather limited. They allowed us to leave our luggage there all day after check-out and picked up our stuff when it was time for our evening train. No complaints.

<Content>Great Budget Hotel We recently stayed at a really good budget hotel in Florence. Hotel Andrea is on Piazza Indipendenza, 19. Its about 15 minutes walk from the Duomo and our room had a terrific view of the Duomo. Rooms were small but adequate. Good buffet breakfasts and nice bar area. Great value and dont think you could find a cheaper hotel this close to the centre.

<Content>Misrepresented The photos on your website must have been taken by the hotel owners many years ago. They bore no resemblance to the cramped, down at the heels hotel we stayed in. It was a long, tiring walk from the train station; the room was cramped and shabby; the bed a bundle of broken springs; and the bathroom filthy and so small that I (a small woman) bumped the wall and fixtures every time I moved. I can't imagine how anyone larger than me could have used it at all. Other travel sites gave it two plus stars, but one star would be a generous rating! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Not good. Really spoiled the trip. The main problem with the hotel was not the fact that it was a schlep from the train station, or that the park in front of the hotel was creepy at night, or that the bathroom was a mold adventure park. The main problem was my fellow guests, which were a teen-aged tour group who thought nothing of late night shout-outs, hallway giggle-fests, and general late-night rowdiness that the hotel refused to cabin. The hotel had an all-night frat-party atmosphere and hotel management tolerated it with a wink and a nod. This is a great hotel if you are 14 and away from the folks for the first time. This is a terrible hotel if you are looking for a comfortable room, updated bath, and pleasant night's rest on your travels.

<Content>Pleasant surprise What a pleasant surprise this hotel was! Not a luxury hotel by any means, but there is a concierge 鈥?I鈥檓 not sure if it鈥檚 24 hour or not, but certainly until at least midnight. They were very, very helpful. They booked reservations, checked train schedules, whatever was needed. Really the kind of service you would expect in a more expensive hotel. The hotel itself is on the 3rd floor. The rooms are not great, but again, I think the service made up for it.I had a room at the front of the hotel 鈥?first room they put me in smelled smoky, but the concierge changed my room upon request. Although a single room, it had a double bed. Fairly comfortable. Fluffy towels in the bathroom changed daily. Breakfast was the standard; coffee, rolls, cereal, yogurt, juice, sliced meat, fresh fruit, hardboiled eggs. The attendant in the breakfast room was very pleasant.I would definitely stay here again, would however request a room at the back of the hotel, as the front faces a park, and often kids would be there until late at night talking.Getting there 鈥?fairly easy if you know which exit to take from the train station. Exit left from the tracks. You want to see the McDonalds when you cross the street. If you look straight up at that point there鈥檚 a sign saying something Nazionale in huge blue letters at the top of the building. Walk there and veer right (there are two streets, forming a 鈥淵鈥? walk to the end of the street and you can cut through the second park. Hotel is on the left side, look for green shutters.
