<Content>Great stay in a quiet hutong Lu Song Yuan is within walking distance of the Forbidden City and just around the corner from a lively pedestrian street with bars and restaurants, yet it is located in a historic courtyard building in a quiet hutong that gives a sense of an older, calmer era in Beijing's history. We loved the classic furnishings and decor, and our room and bath were comfortable room and up-to-date. There were a few drawbacks: service at reception desk was not particularly helpful; brreakfast was pretty unappealing; and the water pressure and temperature in the shower were sometimes erratic, but these were not significant in our overall impression. There's an amazing Sichuan restaurant just a few steps away, and great street food available in the busy street at the end of the hutong.

<Content>Great location, good value Wonderful location in a hutong, excellent walking experiences in all directions. Reasonably close to the Forbidden City, Beihai Park, etc. Rooms are on the small side but homey and comfortable, several charming courtyards. Dining room is very good. Staff is okay with English.

<Content>Atmospheric courtyard hotel Queitly situated in a hutong itself it is a good base for exploring local hutongs and also walking to places like Confucius Temple, Beihai Park and even Forbidden City. Room simple and a little on the small side, but very clean and comfortable. There may be 'better' accommodation in modern tourist-trap hotels, but the atmosphere here is great. Reasonable English spoken and staff friendly. Good buffet breakfast (but slow to get everything out and can be thin later on) and excellent dinners.

<Content>Nice hotel but book best rooms only I really recommend this hotel to whoever wants to experience a traditional beijinese house without making compromise on cleaness and only a little on comfort.Our travel agency booked the cheapest rooms. This should really be avoided (both the agency and these rooms).Comments:1/ General- Very good personnel. Evenso this is generaly the case in China. In this hotel the personal is particulary helpfull and friendly..- Very quiet hotel. In the middle of a Hutong area, no traffic noise.- Renovated last year, everything is clean.- Difficult to take a shower on the 1st floor due to the lack of water pressure.- The restaurant proposes simple meals - a good back up.- Simple breakfast buffet - in my opinion big and good enough.2/ Our rooms- It was almost impossible to sleep: the light of the corridor goes thru a window over the door.- TV only with Chinese programs + HBO and TV5. In 1 room the TV set was not working properly. Issue not solve the second (and last) night.- The rooms are very small. Mine was 1.5 m larger and 20cm longer than the queen size bed. No place for luggages (even small), no locker, no safe, no minibar.I asked the receptionist, this seems to be the same for all normal rooms. I also asked to see the best rooms in the hotel. Very different: Much larger and with view and access to a small courtyard. These are the ones I will book next time.

<Content>Great Hutong Experience Great experience; my wife and I recenty returned from two nights at the Lu Song Yuan. We stayed at the Novotel earlier before we took a side trip to Xi'an. Experiencing the hutong's were the highlight of my trip, and staying in one the last several nights topped it off. Don't expect every detail to be perfect, but I give it high marks overall; the service was above average too. Hey for USD $230, for two nights, breakfasts, and one airport transder, it exceeded my expectations. The location was good, it's a five minute walk to the bell tower through the back streets and with cabs so cheap, it's a five to ten minute drive to the forbidden city and the T Square. The surrounding hutong was upscale with wireless coffee shops, bars, and quaint shops that stayed open till 11:00pm. I even saw the police keeping a local guy in the morning off the side street as he had building materials on his tricycle. They obviously wanted to keep a certain image. Have some afternoon tea in the courtyard (don't rent bikes from the guy across the street. He's nice, but bikes did't get us far). Enjoy.....

<Content>Charming is the word Charming is the best word to describe Lu Song Yuan. This hotel isn't for you if your expectation is a 4-5 star western style hotel with the attached comforts. We recently stayed in Lu Song Yuan for 2 nights and really enjoyed the hotel. The hutong location and atmosphere give a great vibe to the hotel. The staff are exceptionally helpful, friendly and speak the best English we came across in a hotel during 4 weeks in China. The rooms are all a bit unique. We checked out a few, and each one has something to like. Our room was small, with a tiny bathroom, and natural light was provided by a downlight (no windows as the room was in the central area of the building). If it wasn't so nicely appointed the room would be pokey, but instead it was charming and fun. The beds are hard, but that's nothing unusual for China!The courtyard areas are great and provide a great place for an afternoon drink. Staying in a working hutong was a real highlight of our holiday, and I'd recommend it for anyone up for a bit of an adventure.The location is a little difficult for taxi's to find, so bear that in mind - if you aren't up for the exploration I'd recommend getting the hotel to email you the hotel's address in Chinese to help out your taxi driver.

<Content>A brilliant experience My Wife and I actualy stayed at the Lu Song Yuan back in March 2002 and loved ever minute of our stay.Our room was better than we had expected as it was roomy and very traditional. Dispite the cold weather, our room was always warm and very comfortable.I still think of this great place almost every day and if we are to ever retuen to Beijing, we would definatly stay here again due to it's great cultural location and the fact that you are living amongst the locals.

<Content>Happy in the Hutong Just returned from a week's stay. This was our second time staying at the Lusong. Staff is friendly and courteous, rooms are clean and peaceful, bathrooms have been upgraded and the courtyard setting is so restful. Rooms can be small, so ask for 2 twins on a courtyard if possible. A great place to eat is nearby, the PassBy Restaurant, which is a 5 minute walk away. The mom and pop store across from the hotel entrance is a good place to pick up drinks, snacks, etc. Airport transportation is easily arranged. After 2 weeks in Tibet, the Lusong looked like heaven!

<Content>Perfect location for the perfect China experience! The Lu Song Yuan Hotel might be a bit difficult to find at first, but it's worth the search. It's got charm and it's authentic while the rooms are clean, well-looked after and charming. The price is great, compared to what you get. Our room was rather small (double, for a couple) but I liked it nevertheless. It had a Chinese bed (one of these beds with curtains where you have to climb in from the middle of the broader side) which might be a bit small if you're really oversize, a TV, a cupboard, tea-facilities (green tea is always available), a bath, nice Western-style toilet (which is lovely to have in China). It was well cared for, clean, quiet. It depends on the people in the next room, I guess, if the hotel is absolutely quiet or not, but at least the location of the hotel is very quiet, despite being close to a major road. We always took taxis to get to the various places of interest, so I can't say anything about the location in that respect; taxis are extremely cheap, anyway. The breakfast was lovely, especially when we could take it in the court yard (which was really nice, clean, elegant, just wonderful experience). There was toast, coffee, tea, fruit, warm chinese breakfast as well. The staff were friendly, helpful and could all speak reasonably well English. The internet station worked, as well.All in all: A very recommendable place, don't go anywhere near the modern hotels, you'd miss a lovely part of Beijing!

<Content>Nice hotel to experience Beijing hutong life This hotel was a perfect way to experience a very different Beijing from the high-rise hotels downtown. The hotel is decorated beautifully and the rooms are nice. The standard rooms are small and it is well worth paying a little extra to get a room with a courtyard view as they are bigger and more comfortable. There are many cute restaurants and shops in the hutong and it is very safe to walk around at all times. This is not the right place for travelers who want luxury or many modern western hotel amenities. If you want to stay somewhere that allows you to experience Beijing culture then this is a perfect option.

<Content>Too rustic for us This hotel is reasonably priced and the location is ok. In a hutong and near the Ghost Street, Drum and Bell Tower And Lama Temple. But a little far to other sites.We agree with the comment about the small cramped room. Wife thought there was black mold in the bathroom( western toilet and nice bathtub) but I am not sure about that. Restaurant was not to our liking but alternatives are nearby and there is a small shop with water, snacks and fruit just out the front door.Works for those on a restricted budget but we would pay the additional $50 per night to stay at a little nicer place as we see it.

<Content>Cramped but lovely trad Chinese experience This is the perfect property for you if you are looking to escape the Western chain hotels of the downtown area. Located in the Banchang Hutong, this little property provides an excellent base from which to explore the northern hutongs, particularly for those paying an extended visit to Beijing. It is around 15 minute walk to the nearest underground station but taxis are very cheap.The hotel is entirely decked out in Chinese imperial style with some lovely furniture and pieces of porcelain. The communal areas such as the tea room and quad are particularly lovely. We made the mistake of booking a standard room which took the edge off what should have been a perfect experience. They are very small, so small that there is no space for a wardrobe and we had to make do with a few hangars on the back of the door. The bed was also extremely hard. We noticed that the superior rooms were much larger and had four-poster beds.Service was a little lacklustre in places but probably no more so than any other mid-range property in China, bearing in mind it is a 2 star. We had to pay a 100 yuan deposit on a hair dryer and in-room wireless access was a little hit and miss. That said, most people won't be going there for business purposes and the 2 computers in the tea room will probably meet most guests' needs. Breakfast is pretty poor, I recommend walking to the next hutong and enjoying a more substantial start to the day. There are also some nice bars, restaurants and craft shops to look around.

<Content>Very Quaint I absolutely loved the Lu Song Yuan. It was very cute and the hutong that it is in is very charming. It was a little shabby chic (and the red tassels are cheesy) but somehow it fits and adds to the overall charm. The hotel is in a former residence of China's Imperial-Era elite. It is like staying in a historical landmark. I stayed there four times for a total of three weeks over the course of two months. So I had ample opportunity to see it all.The Good: The restaurant is very convenient and the dinner prices are reasonable. Plus they make several excellent dishes that are not on the menu but available if you ask (I should note that I speak Mandarin so I was able to ask, but if you know the proper name of a dish in Mandarin that would probably be enough). The cleaning staff are very gracious and efficient (if you speak Mandarin you must strike up a conversation with them, they are all very nice ladies). They were able to securely store my excess luggage for a small fee each time I went on a side trip. One of my side trips was a two week long trip to the countryside so I very much appreciated not having to lug around extra bags.The Not So Good: Since I was coming and going so much, mail was a bit problematical. My friend sent me a package that I was expecting so I told the front desk to hold on to all my mail while I was gone and I would pick it up when I came back (I asked in Mandarin and I'm sure there was no confusion). I never got the package because they returned it to sender. It arrived while I was gone on my first side trip. That was really the only problem that occurred during my entire trip.Overall I would definitely stay there again. The room rate is reasonable, it has a great historical feel, the staff is very gracious, and it is an excellent location.As a last thought I must recommend dining at the Pass By Restaurant that is just down the alley from the hotel (not to be confused with the Pass By Bar/Cafe which is also just down the street). The food was very well prepared and very well priced. I had a generously sized, very fresh, seared ahi steak for only US$9. The ambiance is also very nice, which is very nice after spending so many meals at the ambiance-less local eateries.

<Content>A Great Chinese Experience I stayed at the Lu Song Yuan for 5 nights in March. As a single female traveler I felt very safe and secure in this hotel and the very interesting hutong neighborhood where it is located. Also, like some other post mentioned, I had a slight problem with the plumbing which the staff quickly remedied, and compensated me for the inconvenience. The front desk staff, especially the two young men that work there, were very friendly and extemely helpful. I feel that staying here gave me more of a true Chinese experience rather than staying at a typical western style hotel. I ate breakfast in the restaurant every morning (and one dinner) which I felt was a fair value for the price.The staff in the restaurant were also helpful, welcoming people. For other meals, I ate down the street at a restaurant called Source, which I would highly recommend. I will surely stay here again.

<Content>Not bad at all The big pro of this hotel is the neighbourhood it's in, and the street it's on. The area is a classic Beijing hutong area, with grey stone courtyard houses set on narrow streets - a dying breed. Another plus, location-wise, is the closeby street with many small trendy boutiques, caf茅s and restaurants. The rooms in the Lu Song Yuan are on the small side and hot water takes ages to travel its way through the old cold pipes, especially in winter, when courtyard view isn't much of an advantage either - you'll want to keep your curtains closed to trap the warmth inside your room. Service is nothing to write home about and breakfast is mediocre. The place does score on character, though, not only its neighbourhood, but also in the building itself, so enjoy the 'old Beijing' atmosphere of the place.

<Content>Wonderful piece of old Beijing Located in an atmospheric if not pristine hutong neighborhood north of the Forbidden City, the Lu Song Yuan is a very pleasant and inexpensive alternative to the tourist traps of Wangfujing Street. Be warned, it's not the lap of luxury, but it's extremely comfortable, well located, and staffed by very friendly, helpful, English-speaking employees. The location is extremely convenient for the restaurants and bars of the Back Lakes neighborhood, just 5-10 mins away on foot.

<Content>Not what I expected. I think we got the worst room in the hotel. The room was tiny, with the double bed up against the wall, so the person sleeping on the inside couldn't get out of bed without climbing over the other person. Also, there was only one tiny window, way up high, so the room felt rather prison cell-ish. The bathroom was recently remodeled, however, and somewhat made up for what the bedroom lacked. The hotel was in the process of painting the interior walls (although we never did actually see anybody painting), so we had to walk over tarps to get to and from our room. The front desk service was very helpful, and they even helped us to figure out how to use the local bus. I think this hotel is too touristy (we only noticed Westerners staying here), although the location in the hutong was kind of neat. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, as I felt it was too pricey. Local restaurants nearby were a much better bargain. Internet service is available at the hotel, but again, it was expensive compared to local internet storefronts. Overall, I was disappointed in this hotel, and I felt it was overpriced ($58 per night) for what we got. I think you pay for the ambiance, which in my opinion, could use some improvement.

<Content>old beijing revealed Lu Song Yuan Hotel is the real thing on a back hutong in an old section of Beijing. Our room for two was small but clean and comfortable. We had to step over a high sill to keep out the gin to get to the beds. People at the front desk were very helpful and could arrange tours. We signed up for a tour to the Great Wall and were taken to a section that was NOT swarming with tourists. Be prepared for commericial unexpected side stops at tourist shops coming and going. This was a bother to us but several of the others in our group bought things. The hotel is within (long) walking distance of the Forbidden City. We were spotted immediately by a young woman who offered to guide us through the grounds. She did a great job for 200 yuan about $25. One especially nice visit was to the Imperial College where two young women volunteered for no charge to take us around. They just wanted to practice their English. There were so few tourists here that it allowed us to really get a feel for what it may have been like for students in 1784. We ate our breakfasts in the courtyard of the hotel each morning and light supper most evenings. On our last night we watched three kites flying far overhead. Recommend this lovely setting for those people who appreciate the old and real over the glitter of the new!!

<Content>Traditional Chinese Experience The Lu Song Yuan was an enjoyable stay and really makes you feel like you're in China. It's located in the middle of a Hutong - narrow streets where local Chinese people live. It has a very traditional look - Chinese lanterns, traditional Chinese furniture. It's not a luxury hotel, but it has the character to make it a great place to stay. Front desk staff speak English better than most of the other hotels we stayed at. Rooms had AC and were decently comfortable. We reserved online and got a transfer from the airport to the hotel. It's so easy to take taxis in Beijing that if I could do it again, I would not book the transfer (however, you do need to take the name and location of the hotel written in Chinese to show to the driver).

The hotel is comfortable enough and the people who work there are helpful and speak English very well. The best thing about this hotel is the location. There isn't a high rise building anywhere in sight and there are plenty of shops and restaurants in walking distance. I highly recommend this hotel if you don't need a luxury Western hotel room and are tired of the traffic in central Beijing.

The hotel is located in a charming historic hutong (alley) neighborhood. One of my most pleasant memories in China is our morning walks through the alleys to get breakfast and wander through the markets.The hotel staff are english speaking and very courteous and friendly. It was not a 5-star amenities and the furniture and walls were a little bit shabby. However, the Qinq courtyard and reading room are wonderfully atmospheric. The bathroom was freshly remodelled with new tile and granite countertops. Very nice. However, a few of the days, we did have a faint smell of sewer gas coming out of the bathroom drain!

<Content>A special cultural gem in the hutongs of Beijing This hotel provides a fantastic experience in a traditional Chinese courtyard hotel in the hutongs of central Beijing. However, you don't sacrifice any modern advantages. Lusongyuan will make travel reservations (air, rail, restaurants, cultural events), change money, provide laundry services, has internet, and the staff speaks English. The area around the hotel is a very charming real-world part of old Beijing. The hotel is within long walking distance of Forbidden City and the Beijing subway system. Breakfast in the open-air courtyard was a special treat each morning. I would stay here again in a Beijing minute!

<Content>Lusongyuan is an Island of Calm/Quiet in Busy Beijing I've stayed in the Lusongyuan twice, the first time in 2001 and more recently in 2005. The service is quite good. The location is excellent. There are a large number of excellent restaurants and several top tourist sites within walking distance of the hotel. Situated in a quiet hutong, the Lusongyuan offers guests an opportunity to see an authentic, closely knit Beijing neighborhood. There is only one real drawback to the hotel. Due to its hutong location, taxi drivers don't always know how to find the hotel. If you speak Chinese, there shouldn't be a problem. If you do not, however, getting back to the hotel can present a challenge.If you take full advantage of the knowledgable front desk, they will hook you up with excellent, well-priced taxi drivers to take you on excursions outside of Beijing. These trips are definitely preferable to joining a bus full of other tourists.

<Content>I'm very satisfied Staying at the Lusong Yuan hotel was probably one of the best decisions we made during our recent visit to Beijing. The hotel's design and appeal is traditional chinese, typical of its hutong neighborhood. It is very different from the usual hotel sophistication, but you can still experience the comforts of big cozy beds, long soak on a warm bubble bath, and cable tv entertainment. A good mix of local appeal and western comfort on a quite reasonable price. We had good chinese food at their restaurant. The menu was in english complete with photos. And they served pretty good buffet breakfasts too. The staff of the hotel was very very accommodating and spoke very good english. They helped us on how to go to the many places of interest in beijing. This service is crucial specially in a city where english seem inexistent. They would even spend time to chat with their guests and learn about the cultures of their home countries. I'd say the hotel played a big part at making our stay in beijing very pleasurable.

<Content>Lusongyuan needs some work I just stayed at the Lusongyuan last week. The hotel is in a bad state. One day there was no hot water which is a problem in Beijing when the temperature is 5 deg C. The hotel also smells bad. The people working at the hotel are incredibly nice, and went out of their way to make me comfortable. My room was about $60 USD which I thought was quite overpriced for the conditions. You can stay at the JW Marriott on the west part of Beijing for about $75.

<Content>Charming courtyard hotel Tucked away in a traditional dusty Beijing hutong, LuSongYuan has all the character and colour that's conspicuously lacking in the blander modern hotels. For starters, it's in an old Chinese mansion constructed around a lovely open central courtyard, rather than a high-rise. It's tastefully furnished throughout with wooden furniture and colourful decorations. In a superior room you get a Chinese-style four-poster bed with gauze curtains. Nb it's not by any means a luxury hotel so obviously can't compete with the swanky Beijing internationals in terms of facilities, vast breakfast buffets, ultra-modern bathrooms etc. But for the money it's great value (there's apparently a dorm for budget travellers though we didn't see this), and very charming and atmospheric. The young staff on reception were pleasant and helpful and many of them spoke good English (none of which was necessarily the norm). There are a couple of computers for internet access (for a fee). The hotel restaurant does decent food, helpfully displayed in a photo album menu. It's in a handy location for the scenic Back Lakes area of town and traditional Hutong neighbourhoods. And even though Beijing can be a bewildering city to navigate, especially on foot, we managed to walk into the centre of town to the main, southern Forbidden City gate in under 25 minutes.
