<Content>AWESOME DEAL! My husband and I stayed at the Iberville Suites in December 08 while visiting New Orleans for a Saints/Falcons game. I was very impressed with our stay. The rate for us to stay here didn't seem right when we checked in! The hotel is immaculate and the staff was AWESOME! I was wondering to myself when I was going to be surprise with the real reason this hotel was such a good price...by the end of the trip I had just come to realize it was just truly a great deal and I was so happy to have come across it!!! The rooms were very large and accommodating. Location was great as it is only one block away from Bourbon, so you are so close to all the action but not too close that you can't get a relaxing nights sleep if you need it. The only two complaints that we had was that you had to go down to the lobby floor to smoke as there are no smoking rooms available in the hotel and also, although we requested one, we didn't have a microwave to heat up leftover food. The food in New Orleans is absolutely awesome, and the portions are HUGE! You will almost always have leftovers and will most definitely want to eat them...but you gotta be able to heat it up!! We were able to take them down to the lobby/front desk and have them heat it up for us. Like I said the staff was great and very courteous! Our next visit to New Orleans we will surely find ourselves staying at the Iberville Suites again!

<Content>Great Hotel-Perfect location We booked this thru Hotels.com and got this hotel at a great price. The price went down 3 times and I was reimbursed for the lower price after calling.This hotel is in a perfect location-within walking distance to everything. It is a quiet hotel-we didnt hear any loud noise from the street. The continental breakfast was average-it did the job for a light breakfast. They even had a waffle maker to make your own waffles. It was perfect to have a light breakfast then head out for a large lunch. The room was very clean and spacious.  The bellman was exceptional-friendly and very helpful.This hotel is attached to the Ritz and you can use their facilities. The gym is absolutely gorgeous!! They have everything and anything you need in a gym. They have several treadmills, ellipticals and every piece of gym equipment you need. Very high quality!! We were very impressed.We will definately stay here again on our next trip.

<Content>Best Deal For the $$$ This hotel is a great value in the French Quarter. It truly is a 4 star hotel and operated by the Ritz. It is very convenient to Bourbon Street with out all the noise. The rooms and bathroom were pretty decent. They do allow pets at this hotel but we only saw a couple dogs coming and going. The staff was ver nice from the front desk to the valet parking. As far as breakfast, it wasn't gourmet but it had what you needed including a waffle maker to make your own waffles. Pastries, cereal, fruit, coffee, milk, juices and tea. If you want a real sit down breakfast go to a restaurant for that.

<Content>Breakfast from hell Iberville Suites is a disgrace to the Ritz Carlton chain of which they are part. (They have direct access to the Ritz-Carlton hotel onto which they back). Breakfast in this hotel is an insult to guests and an experience we have NEVER encountered in any hotel we have stayed in, from 2* to 5*+: In a part of the reception area guests find a few bare wood tables, not very clean. They have to eat out of the cheapest brown throw-away thin plastic plates and plastic cutlery and drink out of carton cups, once they have helped themselves to an unappetizing breakfast. And this is a 4* and expensive hotel, especially for what it is! The ambience is glacial. No one lingers. The atmosphere feels uncomfortable. Reception staff is OK-ish but at no stage did anyone offer help with our luggage to the 9th floor along long corridors. We were glad to move out after one night and stay at the charming, pleasant and beautiful Hotel Maison de Ville nearby, which feels warm and where staff welcome and attention is lovely (and the internet access more than 50% cheaper).

<Content>Fantastic This was my second stay at Iberville this year, we had planned to stay at Maison Dupuy but transfered out of there as it was vile, but thats a diffrent review. I love the calm serenity at the Iberville and find the front desk staff very professional and friendly. We did have a problem with a leak in our room but we were swiftly and effortlessly moved to another room. Both the rooms were clean, quiet and comfortable. Breakfast is a simple help yourself affair which suites me just fine, and there's plenty on offer. As the Iberville is part of the Ritz Carlton hotel you can use the facilities there. I must give a special mention to Claudette Breve a senior concierge at Ritz Carlton. If there was such a thing as concierge university then she would be the principal. Claudette really helped make our stay in New Orleans special, I love it when people are this good at their job. The down side to Iberville is there is no view or private balcony but that means its quiet and if we wanted to sit outside we used the court yard at the Ritz which has a table service for the bar. The only other negative is the waste that is created at breakfast time. The self-service breakfast is served with disposable cups, plates and cutlery. All this plastic and polystyrene goes into the same dustbin and is non-recycled. It is not just Iberville that is wasteful it seems New Orleans is quite a waseful city, nearly every shop has it's air-con up full blast then leaves the door open, how dumb is that?  If you're looking for a hotel in the quarter I would definitely recommend the Iberville Suites. Big, clean and comfortable rooms. Brilliant staff and the room service and cocktail bar were pretty special too.

<Content>Great hotel I was very pleased with my stay at Iberville Suites. The staff was helpful, pleasant and gracious. I had a problem with my hairdryer and an engineer was there in less than 5 minutes to fix it. My room was large and clean.The bed was comfortable. I never utilized the sofabed in the living area, but did my paperwork at the desk in there. The breakfast was satisfying; there was plenty to choose from: waffles, yogurt, fruit, cereal, toast, english muffins, bagels, coffee, juice, milk and tea.Overall, I was extrememly pleased with my stay and would go there again. It is just one block from Bourbon St, close to the streetcar and Canal St and there are many good restaurants in the area.

<Content>Location vs. Ick Factor Let me first say that the location of this hotel is ideal if you are looking to stay in the French Quarter but away from the noise. There was zero view (at least from our suite), but that helped with any noise we might have otherwise had. We were within easy walking distance of Bourbon, Canal, the French Market, the Riverwalk, everything! That's where the good times end however. The bed...seriously uncomfortable, not to mention filthy! As a joke I asked my husband to check the sheets only to find a big lipstick smear on my side of the bed. I don't wear lipstick...There also appeared to be blood stains on the mattress. We also found souvenirs from previous guests all over our suite. These ranged from used glow sticks to bobby pins. I guess it could have been much worse (considering the condition of the bed), but we had the room serviced daily and still found these remnants of past quests in our room.I also found their web site very misleading with regards to wi-fi internet. It states that it is available, but does not say that it's $13 a day. Other misc. charges were noted on the site.Breakfast was decent enough, but the coffee was pretty bad. In my opinion it's worth the couple of bucks and short walk to go to Cafe du Monde.

<Content>Only if there is not much else.... This hotel is in a good location in the French Quarter and has reasonable prices but the first room we got was moldy and had a very loud air conditioner.The woman at the front desk made it very difficult to change the room and the staff were generally neither helpful nor friendly. The furnishings were quite tired. With all of the good choices in the French Quarter, I don't recommend this one.

<Content>great location -- BIG BUGS!!!! We were in New Orleans to drop our son off at college with a 4 night stay at the Iberville suites. The first night we checked in without a problem. We were all talking in the entry part of the suite while unfolding the sofa bed for my son, and I noticed there were 4 of us in the room. Looking at us on the sink/refridgerator area of the room was a 3 inch Roach (AKA water bug, Palmetto Bug). I didnt say a word to the family and calmly removed my boat shoe and quickly dispatched the intruder to join his dinosaur friends. I did not at that time complain since we had to get up early for the college drop off the next day.The next night, after a hectic day at the school, we returned to the room. My wife calmly said, what is that on the rug. It was another reenforcement from army of BUG. A brief battle ensued where I emeged victorius. I placed the foul corpse in the plastic ice bucket bag and placed the bag into the sink for display. The next morning I called the front desk asked for the manager and was sent to the voice mail of Trudy. I left a message with my cell phone number stating that my wife was upset and asked for a call back. All that day i didnt receive a call from the hotel but had received several other calls so the phone was working.The next morning I complained at the front desk and was told that there were several front desks and that my call must have been mistakenly directed to the Ritz Carlton front desk. Oh yeah I can see how someone would confuse the hotels! The clerk apologized took my cell number and said I would receive a call shortly. I did not receive a call.Here is my short review of the Iberville Suites New Orleans:Location -- GreatValet Parking - Great ( not cheap)Rooms - Furnishings are old and mustyService - Great Promises but no follow throughFree Breakfast - Good Bugs - Large and Bold

<Content>Better than it used to be I have stayed at the Iberville Suites over the years. It's a decent price and the location is fine. However, as happens with most hotels, it started deteriorating after a while. I stayed at the Suites in 2005 and swore I would never go back. The rooms were awful - dirty carpet, sagging bed, old furniture, etc. But, I was told that the hotel had been renovated since Katrina and I went back to try it. I had a lovely, clean suite and it actually smelled good. The linens were fairly new and the whole place had been spiffed up. I know it's not the Ritz even though they are sister properties but the management let the Iberville deteriorate to a ridiculous level before they finally did something. If they would try to keep their hotels reasonably maintained, they would have more loyal customers. I think it's a bad idea to let them deteriorate badly before they are willing to put money back into them. People get a bad impression and they never come back.

<Content>Nasty hotel and slow service We checked into the hotel to find the sink area dirty with several red wine stains from where glasses had been sat down. We ignored that and the stains on the curtains and bedspread. Only one lamp was plugged in so we had to get on the floor and plug them in ourselves. All of these were annoyances but the real kicker was when we were ready for bed. The bed had a FLAT sheet directly on the mattress. There was no mattress pad. Our ick factor went up several notches! We called for room service five times over an hour's span of time asking for a mattress pad so our bodies weren't separated from the much used mattress by only a thin sheet. We asked if it was standard practice not to use a mattress pad and no one could tell us. Each call to the front desk we were assured someone would be there in 5 minutes. It never happened. We asked if we could just go to housekeeping, get a pad and make up the bed ourselves. We were told we could NOT!After an hour someone came in to make up the bed using a down comforter as a mattress pad. He made the bed up wrong putting the blanket next to our bodies and the sheet on top of that. We remade the bed, called another hotel and transferred out the next morning. We slept in a VERY worn out bed that sank in the middle. The place was gross. The staff was incompetent. The price was ridiculous - I could have gotten better treatment at a $39.99 a night hotel. Never again!!DeeDee

<Content>Family of 11 loved this place! My husband and I took all the children and grandchildren to New Orleans for our annual vacation and stayed at the Iberville. We rented 4 king suites, and they were big enough to accomodate 11 of us. The lobby and furnishings are beautiful, and we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff each time we passed by. The rooms were very nice even though the furniture was a little dated (but very tasteful and comfortable). When we first checked in, there was just a few minor things such as one remote control out of 8 needed a battery, and the cold water in one sink out of 8 didn't work. The staff took care of all problems within just a few minutes of notification. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. We didn't need housekeeping to come into our rooms, so we just found them each morning and they changed out the linens, trash, and toiletries as requested promptly. There is also an in-room safe. One drawback was lack of a pool except for a lap pool in the Ritz (extra charge if you want to use it because it is part of their spa). However, if a pool is what you need, guests at the Iberville can use the pool at the Marriott. It is a few blocks away and you just have to show them your room key. The continental breakfast was very well stocked with hot and cold cereals, pastries, bagels, english muffins, fresh made waffles, juices, yogurt, milk, hot chocolate, and coffee. This place was a great bargain, and it is only one block from Bourbon Street. If we ever go back to New Orleans, we wil not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you for a great time Iberville Suites!

<Content>People make the difference, but beware the additional charges! It's what you'd expect of an older downtown hotel of the mid-upscale variety. Smaller than optimal room size for a suite, it sports a few older facility issues like narrow hallways and interior windows with no view, but still kept very nice inside. The kindness of the people with whom you come in contact, and the opulence of the interior of the hotel make up for the motel's aging structure. The Iberville Suites is part of a triumvirate of lodgings in the same buildings: Ritz-Carlton, Maison Orleans, and Iberville Suites... all apparently run by the same management. I believe the Iberville is the value version of this property. My biggest gripe is how they nickel-and-dime you for some things you'd find complimentary in most upscale hotels. Though there's a basic Continental breakfast, the website fails to mention the expensive internet access -- $12 per day, wired or wireless. The workout facility (next door) is an additional $12 per day. There's a spa for those who can to afford it at an additional cost. That's where the pool is, so you have to pay just to splash. Parking is an additional $30+ per day. It adds up quickly, so figure those add-ons when you consider the great rate you think you're getting! Bourbon Street is very walkable from Iberville Suites (one and a half blocks), and the building is far enough away from all the noise that would exist on a rowdy night on Bourbon Street. All in all, it's about what you'd expect of an older downtown motel with a very nice face lift and kind employees. Just wish they'd be more inclusive.

<Content>Very Dirty We just came back from our stay at the Iberville Suites, New Orleans. The staff was incredibly nice. You felt very welcomed. The major problem that will stop me from returning is the housekeeping. There has been several news reports on housekeepers just using napkins to clean out glasses or maybe using that blue cleaner to clean glasses, well that is nothing compared to this place. The counters and the table tops were not once wiped clean since the beginning of my stay. I stood there for 6 days. My boys, 4 and 2, ate some waffles and spilled maple syrup on the table and upon check out that table stayed a sticky mess. Yes, I could have cleaned it, but I guess I wanted to see how pathetic the cleaning crew was and sure enough, they were. I called housekeeping to inform them about not wiping off counters and they apologized profusely and said that was not there motto, but aparently it is because the maple syrup is still there. I also notice that the housekeeping staff carry a vacuum cleaner on their wagon of stuff, but it is just for show, because crumbs were everywhere for the six days we were there. Also, do not expect them to change your sheets even if you spilled on them. I had to request our sheets to be cleaned. I had obvious empty coffee cups and plates of finished food and fruit that in any other facility would toss it in the trash NOT HERE! I had to make sure I put it in the already overstuffed tiny trashcan. I had to have the room tidy for the housecleaning crew. I might have well stayed home. It was not relaxing to come back from a fun -filled day to a disgustingly dirty room. The pictures on the websites are beautiful and it does smell like gardenias, but now I think they are trying to hide the smell of the rooms that aren't clean. I can't say how extremely dissappointed I am with the cleaning staff. I will definately not recommend this place to anyone. Maybe their motto is After a night walking through Bourbon Street our guest will not notice the dirty rooms. So beware, and plan on calling housekeeping everyday to remind them that your room has to be cleaned.

<Content>Great Place in the quarter I'm in the middle of my stay here right now and this place is great. I have a queen suite and although it's not as big as suites I have stayed in before it's still every bit as nice. Comfy bed, two TVs, furniture is fine. Small wetbar and fridge. Check in took about 90 seconds. Checked in early with no issues, and this was on a holiday weekend. Got a great corner room with a view of the city. Bathroom, which I'm fussy about is nice, good amenities, rain shower in the tub. Lots of nice details here and also as mentioned in other reviews nice and quiet when you need to rest. Room was clean as a whistle and everything worked fine.Access to Ritz facilties is a nice plus. 12 bucks a day for the gym which is state of the art and very unusual in hotel gyms. Some downsides though...No restaurants, bars or snack shop type deals directly connected to the hotel. The continental breakfast is a very nice touch although it's pretty basic Costco muffins and pastries. Staff have all been very accomodating and pleasant but I didn't see a concierge or any bellhops.All in all, this is agreat place to stay and I wouldn't hesitate to make another reservation here again.

<Content>Above Average Suite Hotel just off Canal with access to Ritz ammenities We stayed at Iberville for the second weekend of Jazz Festival. The city was booked up and this was our second choice based on Trip Advisor and availability. It was an above average suite hotel that was very clean, but I thought the suite was small about the same size a regular room, but with partitions. On the high side it had a big continental breakfast, access to the Ritz-Carlton Spa, Bourbon Street and public transportation to the Festival.

Mixed Review=Depends on what you expect Pros:-Beautiful lobby -Ideal location -A few members of the staff were very charming and helpful -Our room was stocked with Bath and Body Works toiletries (not Kiehl's, but better than something generic!)-Quiet overall, especially for the QuarterCons:-Majority of hotel staff indifferent at best-Miniscule rooms that could benefit from better housekeeping (missing light bulbs, old scratchy sheets)-Our couch with fold-out bed was at least 10-15 years old and hideously uncomfortable, no extra pillows or blankets come with the room-WILL NOT PROVIDE STANDARD SIZED PILLOWS (all pillows, including extra ones we had to request, were these bizarre, 1/3 sized rock hard little devils)-The hot breakfast is only continental with waffle ironFor the price........you can do better. Not terrible, just many strange, frustrating, easy-to-remedy issues I find confusing from a hotel that shares the Ritz-Carlton building.

<Content>Great Hotel-Excellent Price Stayed here to celebrate my husband's birthday during the week--between Jazz Fest weekends. We were received warmly by the doorman when we arrived, and had a quick, friendly check-in. Lobby was very well appointed. Our room was spacious and very clean. I liked that there was a separate sitting room with a comfortable couch, desk, TV, refrigerator and wet bar. Always nice to have a place to store your water and snacks when traveling. Bed was comfortable, and we had lots of fluffy pillows. Bathroom was nice--marble tile, marble vanity. But pretty basic tub and shower. Not big, but not ridiculously tiny either. Has programmable quiet AC/Heat unit (not cheap window units you would expect from a hotel in this price point). Got a room service snack in less than 15 minutes. Location was great! Just a block from Acme Oyster House, and a couple of short blocks to Bourbon. Staff was very helpful with various informational requests. We did not hear any noise from our room. We were able to sleep well (when we finally made it back to the room). There are no balconies, and there is no view to speak of. Our room overlooked the roof of another hotel. But the view wasn't our objective. We wanted a nice hotel that was in the Quarter, but was quiet when we wanted to sleep. It was very nice that the hotel is connected (literally) to the Ritz. Iberville guests use the same business center as the Ritz. Room service is from the Ritz. But room prices are MUCH lower. Very satisfied with my stay, and would definitely recommend.

<Content>Very pleased Rooms very large and clean, bathroom was smallish but nicely decorated with plenty of towels and toiletries, good shower. Housekeeping service was prompt and thorough. VERY quiet hallways and rooms, but no view. Programmable climate control in the room worked well. Wireless internet access is from the Ritz Carlton next door and costs $13 per 24 hours, expensive but the service was fast and you bill it to your Iberville Suites room. The front desk staff was very friendly, at the same time professional and efficient. Excellent location at the downtown edge of the Quarter, we walked to everything including Riverwalk, casino, aquarium, Arena  Superdome, warehouse dist. restaurants, convention center. This was an excellent value and I'm already planning a return trip with family.

<Content>Pleasantly Suprised This hotel is a bit hidden away having to enter through an elevator to the 2nd floor. But upon the doors opening, a nice, well-appointed hotel and helpful staff awaits your arrival. They were always hospitable and friendly. My husband had a few things that need attention (non-working remote, light out above shower, no bath mat) and when we returned from a walk, theywere taken care of. The location of hotel was great. Not too close to all the noise of Bourbon St. but close enough to walk every-where. All the well known restaurants within a few blocks. One block from Canal St. and able to take a trolley if you didn't want to walk. The breakfast was basic but gave you a few more choices other than just coffee and pastries. I was relievedthat I made a good choice in choosing the Iberville Suites. Morepersonable than the bigger hotels and historical building quite charming. We were on the top floor but not much of a view.

<Content>Ritz Carlton may own it but that's where it ends Stayed there prior to Katrina and it was great. True Ritz Carlton service - fresh cookies at the desk at noon, real towels to dry your hands on in the lobby bathrooms, clean well appointed rooms in great condition, hot breakfast each morning.Not this time. it was apparent that the management has cut back on all the little things that meant so much. The rooms were clean but felt tired, light bulds out, safe needed a new battery, checked in and was given a room that wasn't cleaned yet, breakfast was a modified continental, staff was courteous but it seemed forced with most.For the price I've had better treatment and service in some of the small hotels in the french quarter.Ritz Carlton Hotel? Maybe Ramada at best. Hopefully it will change but for the price per night you can do way better.

<Content>What a great place to stay! My wife and I took a 2 day trip to New Orleans and booked a room at the Iberville Suites based on the reviews here. We were pleasantly surprised. The room was just the right size in my opinion. The bathroom was just a tad on the small size compared to other hotels we have stayed at but it wasn't enough to raise an eyebrow to. Like some others, the one thing that did seem awkward was taking an elevator to the lobby and then having to switch to another to go to your room - a minor inconvenience, if any.The hotel staff was super friendly and very accomodating, and the breakfast was plentiful- more than enough to fill even the biggest belly before a day on the town.If you intend to spend a great deal of time in the French Quarter, this is the hotel for you. just a block over from Bourbon Street and not any of the noise or racket from the all-night parties. When to visit the big easy again, the Iberville will be on my short list of hotels.

<Content>Warm, wonderful, world-class service After poring over reviews for hotels in the French Quarter, we reserved at Iberville Suites - and prayed we'd made a good choice... turns out, we chose very wisely.. it was incredible!! The location is great.. and, the hotel is owned and run by Ritz Carlton, in the same building as the Ritz (along with a third, a super-upscale hotel called Maison Orleans.) The rooms, the lobbies, even the complementary breakfasts were wonderful..crisp, clean and very caring people. (They even sent up an iced bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary.) And, all of the Ritz Carlton facilities are there for Iberville guests... lush  luscious! The most amazing thing that happened: I had to make a drug store run late at night and - the nearest open drug store was a mile or two away.. they asked if I had a car (we didn't rent one,) and then offered to drive me there (which they did, in a sleek high-end black Mercedes! Talk about above and beyond.) If you're looking for a great place where you're 100% taken care of, this is your hotel!

After relying on Trip Advisor (once again) we booked a 4-day stay at Iberville Suites and could not have been more pleased, The location is perfect - 1 block from Bourbon Street and all the action - but the QUIETEST hotel we have ever stayed in! All of the employees we came in contact with were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is fine - but of course one day you'll want to go to Cafe Dumond for those amazing beignets. The rooms are very, very clean and it truly is a suite - separate sitting area, 2 TVs, etc. We would most definitely return.

<Content>Not bad I had high expectation but the hotel turns out to be just OK. The staff were very nice. The room is showing its age and not 100% clean. Valet parking is $32 a day and internet is $12.95 a day. The latter particularly bothers me as most hotels we stayed in while driving cross country offer complementary high speed internet. Iberville Suites is located at the edge of the French Quarters so it's a little bit of a walk to, say, Cafe du Mode but Bourbon Street is just a block away and the Charles Street streetcar stop is also nearby.

<Content>Huge room and great location We spent march 27-30 at the Iberville Suites. This was our 5th time to New Orleans and I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Last visit we stayed at the Royal Sonesta, which I would also recommend.The location is within easy walking to bourbon st., the riverfront, harrahs casino, trolley cars stops, the market and many great restaurants, bars, and entertainment.The rooms were very large, clean and nicely decorated. It was nice having an ironing board, refrigerator and coffee maker, as well, as breakfast in the lobby every morning which consisted of waffles, muffins, donuts, cereal, breakfast bars, juice, coffee, etc. I would highly recommend the segway city tour, cajun pride swamp tour, riverboat cruise and a garden district/cemetary tour . . .all are very fun.We have eaten many places and this trip really enjoyed Star Steak and Lobster next to the House of blues. We got a coupon on restaurant.com for $50 off if you spend over $100 which was great.I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Nice property We were in New Orleans celebrating our anniversary. The Iberville was great for us. We didn't find the staff overly helpful, but we didn't have need of their assistance. The location can't be beat. Great walking to every where in the Quarter. Our room was nicely appointed and was clean and neat. There was ample light for us. We enjoyed having a fridge in the room. The bathroom is nice, not huge but very usable. We have previously stayed at the adjoining Ritz Carlton and thought it compared pretty well, especially considering the price difference. We did not enjoy the breakfast much. We expected a better quality lay out than we were presented with, but if you know this going in it will be OK. It was basically like a motel breakfast, but in much nicer environs. When we return to New Orleans we would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>great place A group of us stayed at the Iberville for two nights in March of 2008. It was a good experience for all of us. Some got in late and the hotel had over booked, so they sent them to the Ritz Carlton for the same price. Ritz is in the same building, same hotel group. Our suite was spacious, nicely decorated and very comfortable. It is also located away from the noise but close enough with in walking distance to all the activities and etc. The hotel serves a continental breakfast included in the room price, I was not impressed with it , it is OK, but I do not like drinking coffee from styrofoam cups.

<Content>What a great place to stay! We (2 adults, 2 kids and one grandmother) had two rooms at the Iberville for 4 (too short) nights starting March 24. From the moment we arrived, we enjoyed such great service, warmth, friendliness and assistance that I'd make this hotel my first choice upon returing to NOLA.The bell staff is excellent there--very friendly and helpful and QUICK! Desk staff was pleasant--always greeting us as we went by. And housekeeping was efficient and thorough.The hotel's location is perfect--just off Boubon. Close to the action but far enough to be quiet.The complimentary breakfast in the morning was great--coffee was always a godsend after a night out, and theirs was hot and tasty.We enjoyed a jazz band in the Ritz's restaurant one night--excellent music and right next door. And there are plenty of great restaurants nearby--try Mr. B's, Acme or Felix's for some tasty seafood.Finally, at the rate we had ($89/night), the room was a steal. For the cleanliness, beautiful lobby, level of service, location and breakfast, I would have expected to pay much more.Parking was an additional $32 a night, but offered quick in-and-out service and great bell personnel, so it was worth it! I really cannot imagine a better stay than the one we just had at Iberville. Kudos to everyone there!

<Content>Great place, and the price is definitely right! Checked into the Iberville midday, and was greeted by a very friendly valet who immediately signaled a bellman to come over an help us with our luggage. Went upstairs to the lobby, checked-in, and headed to our room. A few minutes later, the bellman arrived with our luggage. The place has a very helpful staff, always willing to help with whatever - including great restaurant recommendations! Location of the place is also great! The building and lobby itself were also very elegant.Room was nice and spacious. Our view was of an abandoned warehouse that resembled a crack-house - but that didn't bother us too much. The furnishings weren't in the best condition, but for $89 a night, I definitely wasn't complaining. The two things that I did have a big problem with though were the horribly uncomfortable pull-out couch and the fact that we could hear everything going on in the hallway outside of our room.Overall, this place is a great value for the money - if they added a pool, did a few furniture touch-ups, replaced the doors and the pull-out couch mattresses, it would be perfect!

<Content>Smokers Beware This hotel was nice, but bathroom a little small. The free breakfast had many choices. The problem I discovered occurred after I left. While checking my bank account online, I discovered a $250.00 charge from Iberville Suites that I did not make. I called the hotel and was told that the charge was a smoking fee. The lady I spoke with told me that I had requested a smoking king(smoking or non-smoking was a choice on their web site reservations)and they were a non-smoking hotel!! I was never informed when I checked in that there would be a charge for requesting a smoking king nor was it stated anywhere, and when I checked out of the hotel, I was not informed of the charge!! I had planned to stay at this hotel in the future, but not after being ripped off like that!! I plan on contacting my bank and letting them know that I did not authorize the $250.00 charge!!! I gave the hotel a chance to credit my account. The lady said she would have to talk to the manager and assured me she would call me back, and I never heard a word from them!!

<Content>Great hotel! My husband and I stayed here for Mardi Gras. It was in an excellent location, just one block from Bourbon and one block from Canal. The hotel staff were very friendly and even honored my request to change to a different room with a bigger bed without any problems. The room was very nice, clean, and spacious. I would recommend parking in the garage across the street, it's only $18 a night as opposed to the $32 a night for valet parking. My only complaint is that we didn't have any hot water the second day we were there. I guess alot of people were showering at once. Overall, it was a great place and I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Great Location Great Price The hotel is in a wonderful location. The valet parking is a great plus! The rooms are large and perfect for a family with children. It is nice to have 2 televisions and 2 rooms. It was very quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The refrigerator was an added bonus. When we checked in, there was no record of the reservation that I had made with Travelocity. I was glad that I had a copy of the paid reservation. The staff at the front desk and the bell staff were all very friendly and nice. The room had a huge red stain on the carpet in front of the refrigerator. The tub had a lot of chips on it. The sink area had not been cleaned well....there was dried toothpaste on the marble around the sink. If the management would spruce up the rooms with new paint, carpet, and bathroom fixtures, the Iberville Suites would be rated much higher in my book. On the morning that we were to check out, we received a print out of our room charges under the door. They had charged my card for our stay. I went to the front desk and showed them that I had prepaid, and she assured me that I was not being charged again. (And the charge was much higher than I had paid through Travelocity!) I am holding on to my receipt from Travelocity, in case a charge shows up on my credit card. I don't have a good feeling about it.

The bedroom is in the back of the room, by the window. It can be shut off by a door, so, any sound in the hallway can't be heard. King size bed very comfortable. Staff service very courteous and helpful.One block from Bourbon Street or Canal (all the Mardi Gras parades)! Close, easy walk, to anywhere in the French Quarter, and it's charms and vices.I'd recommend the Iberville Suites to anyone wanting a terrific place to stay at a reasonable price in the French Quarter.

<Content>exactly what we wanted My wife and I just returned from the Iberville Suites. Here's what we liked about it:- Good proximity to Bourbon Street and well situated in the French Quarter. We could stay out late and feel safe walking home. Many of the hotels rated well on this website are located in the business district, but that would've been too far away from the shops and clubs for our taste. This location is ideal.- Quiet. We had a room facing the interior on the eighth floor. The bedroom portion of the suite was dead quiet. The sitting room had a little noise from passersby in the hallway, but that was perfectly fine.- Very spacious for the amount of money that we spent. It was clean, and the furniture was comfortable. The bed was comfy as well. We didn't try out the sleeper sofa mattress. Overall, it was a great value, and would be a great option for a family of four.- The staff was pleasant and helpful. The maid service was good too.- It was also nice to have access to the Ritz next door. They had a 24 hour business center that we could use. It was expensive though -- it was $7 for 15 minutes of computer use, plus extra charges for printing. We had no major complaints. We couldn't seem to get the safe to work, but they probably would've helped us if we asked. They also have a sign in the lobby indicating that they have an ATM down a short corridor, but no ATM was there. No big deal. Overall, a great stay in wonderful New Orleans.

<Content>nice, BUT... A nice hotel, with several problems:- I have been given a room at 4th floor: it was a very noisy one, due to some machines (probably the general air conditioning). Ear plugs needed to sleep;- A 7 minutes international call costed me 75 $. The rate was not notified in the hotel book;- there's no bar in the hotel.

<Content>Great Location and Value My husband and I planned a last minute trip to New Orleans and this was one of the only hotels available. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. It had a very grand lobby and we were greated by very friendly staff. It is in the same building as the Ritz Carlton and I think it's the same management. Our room was nice. It felt very homey! If you are sharing a room with a friend or children the sofa can be made into a bed.The refidgerator actually kept our beverages so cold they had ice in them. The bathroom was nice. The hotel was located a block off Bourbon Street. You couldn't hear any street noise but, you could hear people in the halls if you were in the front section of the room. Across the street there is a bar called the Alibi. It's lots of fun, many local people go there when they get off work on Bourbon Street!

From the wide spread at breakfast to the gym/pool/jacuzzi facilities in the Ritz, everything was top notch. The rooms have a separate living area with a TV and kitchenette. Bathrooms are clean and spacious (not huge but not crammed either). All in all, 5 stars.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, great location, great price! I booked the Iberville Suites based on other's recommendations, and I was not disappointed. The price was extremely reasonable for the location, and when I got to the hotel I was thrilled with the quality for what I had paid. The hotel is attached to the Ritz-Carlton and definitely has a Ritz-Carlton feeling when you go in! The staff was friendly. If you are interested in fitness while there, you get to use the Ritz fitness center free of charge, which is a real treat. If you walk out the main entrance you're about a block from Bourbon Street so the location is perfect...I was by myself and a little hesitant to walk in that alley, but it was well lit and I felt very safe. Parking at the hotel is $32 a day for valet service, but just across the street you can drop off your car in the parking garage for $18 overnight, which is what I did. The room was nice, old school french antiquey - just what I expected. The only issue I had was that they gave me a handicapped room with a shower holder that was broken, so I had to do a one-handed shower. I have to say, that really did make me feel like I was in Europe! But otherwise everything was great, the room was very spacious and the bed was extremely cozy. I recommend this hotel!!

We had two rooms and the staff was nice enough to accomodate us with side by side rooms. Once we got to our floor, we noticed the corner room was available and called the front desk and asked for that one. No problem!! The staff here couldn't be nicer or more friendly. The rooms were lovely, well-kept and cleaned promptly and completely every day. I would stay here again on my next visit to New Orleans without hesitation

Its not right in the quarter, but just a block away, which is perfect.The website doesn't give you a true idea of how great the rooms are. They were very clean, large  accommodating. Anyone who gave this hotel a bad review could not have stayed in the same hotel my husband  I did this past weekend. Highly recommended.

<Content>Not a Four Star Hotel I recently stayed in the Iberville Suites to attend a conference. I reserved the room four months in advance. I should have known there were going to be problems when a month later I tried to change the reservations by one day and was told they did not have my reservation, despite me having a confirmation number. By speaking to a different person a day later, I was able to get the reservation straightened out. The week before my arrival, I confirmed the reservation and that I would be a late check-in. When I showed up atthe hotel, I was informed that they cancelled my reservation since they had that I was to arrive a day earlier and was listed as a no-show. Luckily I had extensive notes on who I talked to and when, and after being faced with the information they 鈥渇ound鈥?me a room. When Igot to my room I found that the floor had obviously not been vacuumedand that none of the lights in the bedroom worked. After fumbling around in the dark, I found that the lights had been unplugged. Maybeit was so I would not notice the dirty carpet or the broken furniture. The bed was the worst I have experienced in a hotel in this price range. The pillows were no better. The first night I used a water glass for a soda and left it on the counter. The glass and the debris on the floor remained untouched until the fourth day of mystay! The complementary breakfast was minimal, with plenty of carbohydrates and no fruit. The common areas of the hotel were well maintained and clean. The staff was reasonably helpful. The best thing that this hotel has going for it is its location. It is a very short walk to Bourbon Street. Next time I will go back to the EmbassySuites.

<Content>Great value! Perfect location! We had read the reviews about this hotel and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is beautiful (adjacent to and operated by the Ritz Carlton) and the rooms are spacious. Best of all was the price - an incredible value for the French Quarter. And the location can't be beat - just one block from Bourbon Street but absolutely quiet.We had a room on the 10th floor facing downtown. The room did have a drawer handle missing on one nightstand and a lightbulb out over the bar area, but other than that, everything was in good shape. Some reviews have complained about maid service, but our experience was very good. They cleaned the room quickly and replaced all towels and amenities each morning.The free breakfast was also very good. Expecting only rolls and coffee - we got lots of fresh baked goods, waffles, fruit, yogurt, juice, cereal and milk.There was a Saints game in town our last night there and we saw that other hotels were crowded and noisy, but the Iberville was very calm (crowded yes, but quiet - well, the Saints DID lose that night!).Overall, a terrific experience and we can't wait to go back!

<Content>Dirty Iberville Suites We stayed at the Iberville Suites for my niece's wedding rehersal supper and wedding on the weekend of 8/3/07-8/5/07. The lobby was beautiful and staff were wonderfully kind and helpful. The rooms were dirty and the furniture was aweful. The sofa cushions had holes in them and the sofa bed matress was all springs and the king bed wasn't much better. There were no a/c vents in the living room so we had to sleep with the bedroom door open as my 89 yr. old mother stayed on the sofa. The bathroom had burned out lights as did the area where the refrigerator was. I wonder if that was on purpose so we couldn't see how dirty and decrepid the furnishings were. The bedspreads were old and faded and had lint balls on them. Although we had 2 suites and that part was nice as they were side by side; I wouldn't stay here again. The location was great as it was central to where we needed to be. I will not stay here again as some of my family members stayed at much nicer accoummodations at the same cost and area. I plan to be back in that area for an overnight stay and will stay at the Marriot or Bienville House. Joanie BecnelLaPlace, La. 70068

<Content>Great place to stay We just returned from a trip to New Orleans and a Carnival cruise to Mexico. Before the cruise, we stayed 2 nights at Iberville Suites in the French Quarter; which is within walking distances of alot of quaint shops, parks, a lake, historical sites, and restaurants. The hotel is in a historic building connected to the Ritz Carlton. Our hotel was elegant and classy with a large lobby that held continental breakfasts every morning. Our room was truly a suite with colorful art on the walls and dark rich furniture. We had a couch with plenty of reading lights then further on was a sink area and refrigator. The bathroom had marble tile and was roomy. The bathroom was equipped with soaps, shampoo/conditioner, and lotion. The room closet held a full size ironing broad, iron, extra pillow, extra blanket, and a safe deposit box. Next was an area for our spacious king size bed that was comfy and had lots of pillows that faced a tv cabinet. We only paid $92 a night and overall, it was a great place to stay!!

<Content>pretty good place to stay The Iberville Suites New Orleans is a pretty good place to stay in New Orleans. I read reviews prior to booking, they were all over the place. My experience was very positive. The room was a suite, with a seperate sitting room. The room was clean and in order when I arrived. (For some reason every lamp in the room was unplugged? I figured it was the previous occupant with a lightening phobia) The room was quiet. Everything worked. The maid came in every day and cleaned. Location is good, off canal in the french quarter. The Iberville part of the hotel is a little disconnected from the Ritz part. So it takes a little extra elevator jog to get to your room. This isn't apparent when you first arrive so it can be confusing.Staff was courteous. Nice restaurant across the street..Deanie's with good Lousiana seafood choices. By the way. I got a great deal on this room.

<Content>Excellent value We spent two nights at the Iberville in July of '07 and had a very pleasant experience. The hotel is on the edge of the French Quarter, within easy walking distance of Jackson Square and Bourbon Street. Our room was large and was truly a suite -- it included a sitting area with a pullout couch and a separate bedroom.The hotel is in the same building as the Ritz, so you get some of the Ritz service without the price. When we went to arrange a city tour we were directed to the concierge, who is in the Ritz. But the best part of our stay was the price. We paid $86 a night for our room. If you drive in, as we did, you will get hammered for parking.

<Content>Please don't stay, pay the extra and stay at the Ritz Our rooms were never cleaned. We booked a suite and the pull out sofa could not be pulled out because a tv was blocking it. There were crumbs and candy wrappers on the sheets. We were transferred to a regular room with a promise to move to anoter suite the next day. The next day we were told, there were no suites available. Room service served us chicken that was still bleeding. The maids did not clean the rooms thoroughly, the carpets were so dirty you did not dare sit on them or walk on them barefoot. I had to go to the Ritz Carlton lobby to get an internet connection on my wirless laptop. They do not have their own spa you have to pay an extra $12.00 dollars to visit the Ritz Carltons...I would never stay here again.

<Content>A nice stay I would agree with most of the positive reviews with just a couple of exceptions. My room hardly qualified as a suite. The rooms in the hotel vary. Mine was a standard room with a frosted glass divider between the two beds. No sitting area. Though the room was serviced daily, it was never vacuumed. It had not been vacuumed upon my arrival and the same debris remained on the floor until the second full day of my stay when I requested it be addressed. HOWEVER, the staff was very attentive and friendly. The location is excellent (straddling the French Quarter and the CBD). The building is well maintained. Overall the experience was above average and I will probably stay there again.

I've paid a lot more for a lot less in the French Quarter. The room was very comfortable and very convenient to everything. Housekeeping could have been a little better, but I'm not real picky about that kind of thing, so it was okay. The parking is a bit pricey at $32.00 a day, but it is valet with in and out privileges. Great complimentary continental breakfast and Bath  Body Works amenities. If you run out of anything, there is a Walgreens two blocks away. I will definitely stay there again on my next visit to New Orleans!

<Content>Mixed Experience at Iberville I booked a room here based on a recommendation from my sister as well as the fact that the hotel is affiliated with the Ritz. First the good: the location is great, just 2 blocks away from the mayhem of Bourbon street and walking distance to just about everywhere in the quarter. Hotel provides a better than average continental breakfast in the lobby. The rate was very fair, especially considering that the rooms are mini suites (basically a sitting room with an extra tv , couch and desk) Management made effort to address my housekeeping issues in a suitable manner. The Bad: no mini bar in room, bed linens are quite worn and torn. Housekeeping neglected to clean our room on two of our 6 days and in fact the bathroom was cleaned subpar upon our check-in. I would advise that you call housekeeping each time you leave the room to alert them that you need services (especially if you are late sleepers.) Be prepared for the frustration that may arise if you still do not have a clean room when you return.

<Content>Good hotel but not the Ritz I chose this hotel for our trip based on comments left by previous guests and one of the comments was that this hotel was owned by The Ritz and therefore the service was comparable. I have stayed at The Ritz before and Iberville Suites, while good, is certainly not of the same quality.This location is still a work in progress and lacks things like an ATM Machine and functional vending machines. It is actually directly attached to The Ritz and you can use their concierge and other services, which was helpful. However, if you want to use the gym or the business center, again, you have to go to The Ritz and there are fees. It is $12 per day to use the gym and a $7.50 minimum to use the computer in the business center. Bad enough that The Ritz charges their paying customers for these services but if you stay at Iberville Suites, you will have to pay them as well.The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was nice but rather dark and simple details were overlooked such as torn sheets on the bed and certain things in the room not cleaned to the quality we would have liked. The room was also quite dark and considering the hotel was less than half full, an upgrade to a room with a better view would have been a nice touch. The bed was also way too soft.The location of the hotel was good. It's just a block away from Bourbon Street and the action of the French Quarter but far enough away that it was quiet and safe.

<Content>Great value We have stayed at many of the French Quarter hotels. While this might not be the most historic or well known - believe me - it is one of the best!! So easy to get to get in and out of - a big plus in the Quarter. Also, it's quiet, clean and convenient to everything. Don't expect a whole lot of amenities; however, you can walk to the adjoining Ritz and use the facilities (spa, bar, restaurant). For the price, this is a steal.

<Content>Up to Date Review of this property!!! I was a little concerned as I didn't see many up to date reviews of this property POST Katrina. I felt like this was a GREAT place to stay given the price I paid. The staff was VERY friendly and were quick to help me in any way they could and I had SEVERAL special requests!! They didn't even blink an eye just jumped on it. The hotel is in relatively good condition however I did notice the furniture in the room was very worn and the ROOMS ARE SMALL, although the fact that every room has a seperate sitting area would lead you to believe that it is a SUITE in every sense of the word. Our room smelled like smoke although the entire hotel was non-smoking. If you decide to drive you may use the facilities parking to the tune of $38 A DAY!!! But if you have ever been to New Orleans you know that a car is not only not necessary but is more trouble then it is worth. The breakfast buffet consisted of self serve waffles, muffins, pasteries, cereal, toast, bagels, and fresh fruit. The maid service did leave a little to be desired. I paid about $90 a night for the room and for that price was pleased with the accomodations.....however if I had paid much more I would have been a little disappointed. Ultimately, if you plan on spending a significant amount of time in your room...you may want to look for something a little more lavish....and I would have DEFINATELY been disappointed if I had booked this hotel for a honeymoon or special occaison. BUT....If you are looked for a good clean hotel...with nice amenities (located in the RITZ)....nice lobby....good perks (located in the RITZ)...and DON'T plan on spending the entire time in your room...this is a GREAT DEAL!!!!!

<Content>Great Experience We just got back from 1 night at the Iberville and we all had a wonderful experience. Based on some previous reviews I was a little concerned - but being Jazz weekend - this is where I was able to get rooms at a decent price. Not to worry. This is a really nice hotel - comfortable, clean, friendly staff, and in a very good location. It is an easy walk to the heart of the French Quarter yet off the main street so quiet and peaceful. All in all - I would certainly stay here again and can recommend it to y'all. Be aware - parking is pricey ($32) but as we checked around that was not out of line for the Quarter. This was my third trip bacl to NO since Katrina and it was great to see things up and running with lots of tourisits. There are quite a few shops that could not hang in there, which is sad - so if you are looking for a neat place for some fun, great food and shopping - go have a good time in NO and support the local economy :-)

<Content>A Happy Anniversary Experience The location was excellent. We were so close to many of the attractions such as the French Quarter, the Market, Riverwalk, and only one block from Bourbon St and Canal St! The hotel is attached to the Ritz Carlton and the ammenities are offered to all of Iberville's guests. The price was over $100 dollars less per night than at the Ritz and just as nice.  The staff was amazing! Everyone was polite and helpful. We felt like we were being catered to the entire stay. My husband  I booked this hotel for our anniversary . My husband contacted the hotel and inquired about what type of specials that the hotel could do for us for our first anniversary. He arranged to have chocolate covered strawberries and Moet champagne waiting to surprise me when we arrived in our room. We arrived to the hotel about 4 hours before check in and the staff allowed us to enter early. Since we arrived before expected, the staff promptly delivered my surprise before we finished unloading our luggage!We were very happy with our choice. We visit New Orleans often and will be staying here each time we go back. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be close to the attractions, looking for a bargain, and needing a peaceful place to rest.

<Content>NOLA is coming back... I was there for a business convention and the hotel had just re-opened (following Katrina) the day before. The staff was courteous and helpful, everyone from the bellmen to housecleaning. The day I departed it was very early and the complementary breakfast area was just being set up. The gentleman at the front desk kindly went back and got me a freshly brewed cup of coffee for my trip to the airport. While you could tell the furniture in the rooms had been recently touched up as part of the renovation, it wasn't enough to diminish my experience. It's not the Four Seasons, but most travelers won't be disappointed. The place deserves an Excellent rating for rising above the Katrina disaster and hiring good replacement staff.

<Content>It didn't live up to my expectations The first room I was given had not been cleaned. There were towels on the floor and some other details had not been taken care of. After requesting that it be cleaned up and spending 2 hours in the French Quarter, I came back to the same dirty room. I requested that the front desk move me and they did to a pleasant room.The music of George Butts was wonderful over in the Ritz and the food in the Grill was delicious but lonely with not a single person eating in there besides me.I am glad I had the Iberville experience even if it could have been better.

<Content>Very Disappointing!! We were very disappointed in this hotel. The hotel clerk when we check in was more interesed in reading a book than our check in, but more importantly was the accomodations. Our room had not been cleaned when we went to the room assigned. We called the front desk and was told to stay there and someone would be up to take care of it. After 30 minutes we requested another room. It had been so called cleaned however did not meet a minimum standard of cleanliness. The halls of the hotel were in desperate need of vacumning. After going out to eat, not receiving any decent directions from the front desk, we went back to the room to retire for the night. We noticed we did not have any soap in the bathroom, we requested some. After an hour we went to bed. At 7:10 the next morning we again requested some soap. At 8:30 we gave up and checked out. ONE thing that was great about this hotel was the bell service staff, consistently give the best service and made attempt to make up for the otherwise terrible stay. I cannot believe the Ritz Carlton would be associated with this type of property.

<Content>Very nice We stayed at the Iberville Suites 8-20-05 for only one night. We are so glad that we found this place after having some pretty bad experiences on previous visits to New Orleans. The accomodations were exactly as advertised, which were great and the price was most reasonable. The suites are beautifully furnished with everything one needs. The concierge was most helpful on giving us dining tips. Hotel staff was very nice  they have a wonderful complementary breakfast. We will definately stay at the Iberville Suites again.

<Content>Super nice place Just got back from one of the most wonderful places on earth. We stayed at the Iberville in New Orleans and it was a nice place to stay. Only one problem, the mattress on the sleeper sofa was a little worned out, but other than that the hotel is great. Perfect location, nice breakfast, super freindly staff. For the price, you can't go wrong here.

<Content>I would stay here again We stayed for 2 nights after a cruise with our daughter. We arrived way before check in time but we were able to check our bags before our room was ready so we could walk around the French Quarter.The bell service personel were extremely helpful and courteous asking if we needed directions or anything else.We had a King suite. While our daughter said the pull out couch wasn't so comfortable, I found the bed to be one of the best I have slept on in any hotel. When we checked out we were in a hurry and inadvertantly left very important papers in the safe in the room. When we returned back to San Diego and discovered our mistake, I immediately called the lost and found at the hotel. The lady I spoke to, Anita, was so helpful and understanding. She said she would call back as soon as she had the papers from the safe and Fedex them the next day. She was true to her word. I want to thank Anita for going above and beyond for our oversight.I really liked that the hotel was so close to everything. Even in the heat of July it was so easy to walk. I would definately stay at the Iberville Suites again.

<Content>Exceeded Expectations Based on other reviews, we must have low expectations. For the price we paid, I found the Iberville to be far more than adequate. Our suite was not the largest I've visited, but large enough for the three of us. My son had no complaints about the comfort. Sure we ran into a couple problems, like not enough towels, but that was a case where we wanted more than the average person. I guess if you expect Ritz quality you should be staying at the Ritz not one of their companion hotels. It's less expensive for a reason!The location is perfect. Easy walking distance to Canal Street and the trolleys. One block to Bourbon Street. An easy walk to Jackson Square. One must remember that N'awlins is an old crowded city. Parking is a premium. You have to be crazy to think you are going to drive around the French Quarter, anyway. On the down side we expected a pool which turned out to be at the Ritz ($10 fee). We found the staff helpful. The desk clerk even pulled out the phone book and called a restaurant we wanted to try to find where they were, then marked it on the map for us.We wold not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Great Deal and service Just a block away from Burbon Street, the hotel has very nice rooms and just about everyone always had the appropriate greeting for us throughout the day and evening.The complimentary continental breakfast is typical but good including do it yourself pre-measured batter belgium waffles.If you have a rental car valet is $25 a day, or the garage across the street is slightly lower.Otherwise the Quarter is in walking distance, or take a taxi for outside adventures such as the casino.The hotel is affiliated with the Ritz-Carlton next door and for a $1 a day you can utilize their spa area/pool.The only drawback is that you must walk out from the hotel and next door to get to the pool.When asked by the locals where we were staying, everyone responded with their approval of the hotel.I received a great rate which made the stay all the better, and an overall good experience.

<Content>Lousy service This hotel is well-located and nice looking. If that's all you require, you are all set. However, you would also have to be willing to forgo maid service and polite responses to inquiries. We were out of our room from 10 am to 4 pm - we returned hot and sweaty, wanting nothing more than a rest and a shower before we went back out on the town. To our surprise, the maid had yet to visit our room. We let that go. We were so pooped. We had also asked about a cot to replace the fold-out couch which was too uncomfortable to sleep on and were offered a feather bed to put on top - nice option right? However, the feather bed never appeared. We called in the afternoon - its on its way. In the evening - we will get it to you. After returning from dinner - it'll be right up. 45 minutes later - I just gave it to housekeeping. 30 minutes after that - we don't have any - how about an extra blanket? ARRRRGH! The desk people were rude and unhelpful. I would never stay here again.

<Content>Quite Suite's In the Midst of It All We arrived at the Iberville Suites early around 12:00 pm and were checked in early. I had reserved a queen suite but upon request of my travel companion was upgraded to a king suite. No extra charge! The suite was spacious and the bed very comfortable. We had an issue regarding how the room had been cleaned and it was taken care of IMMEDIATELY! The maid apologized. We had no problems at all after that incident. I can honestly say that I didn't find one rude person that was employed here. There are plenty of excellent restaurants available at a very short walking distance and it did not concern us in the least that there was no restaurant at the Iberville. This is a beautiful place to stay while visiting New Orleans. I recommend it to anyone wanting to visit the French Quarter. Bring a good pair of walking shoes and ENJOY!

<Content>Very nice quaint property, great location We just returned from a four night stay at the Iberville Suites and I think the property was just adorable. We were there for the Essence Music Festival and the property was sold out not to mention the city had approximately 250,000 tourists for the weekend. The hotel is on the edge of the French Quarter and about a block from Canal Street. Very accessible to everything and we even walked to the Convention Center. It was quiet but we could walk about 5 minutes and be in the French Quarter. We went to the bar in the Ritz and had a few drinks and listened to some great entertainement. The breakfast buffet was the average, but hey it's included in the price and it beats room service which can be pricey. The staff was very accomondating even though we had no issues. The only thing I suggest to be aware of if you are going for some Specialty Event as they put it, they will charge your credit card the full amount of your stay 45 days before you arrive. That was a big shock to us and we do plan to write the Ritz Carlton Corporate office about that. But all in all the property is very nice, clean, and spacious. After all it is owned by the Ritz!We will definitely return to this property.

<Content>Great location - Very nice hotel! My husband  I just returned from a 5 night stay in New Orleans at the Iberville Suites. We checked in very late - 1:30 a.m., so they did not have our requested King bed suite available. They gave us a queen bed suite and told us to check with the desk the next morning....We spoke with Nicole, and she did find us a King suite which we moved to and loved! The breakfast buffet had many choices each day--waffle's (which you make fresh yourself in one of two irons), cold cereals, oatmeal, rolls, bagels, english muffins, toast, muffins, yogurt, choice of fresh fruit, orange juice, apple juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate.....excellent breakfast included in price of room!The location is perfect! Right in the French Quarter - everything within easy walking distance. The doormen  all of the staff that we came in contact with were very polite and helpful. They say you can use the Ritz's gym (for a fee), and pool, but we never ventured there....I would definitely return to the Iberville Suites, and would recommend it to friends and family!

<Content>False Advertising Overall, a nice hotel. However, the services offered were not as good as what was advertised. The advertisement claims that it's connected to the Ritz, which is true, in the sense that it shares a wall. All the services such as the pool, fitness center, restuant are in the Ritz and you have to leave the building to get to them. Also, there is an extra fee associateted with everything. This would be fine, if the service deserved it. Instead, we seemed to be paying Ritz prices and getting Motel quality service. For example, room service took close to two hours. The rooms weren't ready on time and the whole complex seems to have expereinced some hard living from other visitors. Still, it's in the French quarter and the bed is clean. The breakfast is good for a continental. The service just isn't what you'd expect from a luxury hotel.

<Content>Good hotel, could be great! This hotel has a great location. If you are without a car, the hotel is perfect. Close to everything. Adajacent to the Ritz, the spa and fitness center are very nice. Check out the Ritz hotel bar for drinks and entertainment before dinner. Felt the hotel did not live up to the Ritz standards of cleanliness. The carpet was dirty and stained and when I asked that it be cleaned while we were out sightseeing the management said it would be taken care of. When we returned, we were met with excuses that it couldn't be taken care of that day and offered another room. There was also a smear of blood on the bathroom door and toothpaste in the sink. Ritz management needs to get involved with the housekeeping staff to bring this good hotel up to great standards.Also, the front desk personnel are very unenthusiastic and unfriendly. They don't go the extra mile to make the guest feel special.

FABULOUS breakfast every morning. You could skip lunch! Had a problem with our first room and they switched us immediately. We stay in a lot of hotels and we absolutely loved the Iberville.

<Content>Loved our stay Our group of three adults enjoyed the short stay at the Iberville.The suite was more than we expected. Lots of room both the bedroomand sitting room. Our son who is 25, enjoyed his extra space for the T.V. He used the sleeper sofa and had a good sleep. The room was above average for everything. I loved the French furniture, the wet bar, the use of a bar fridge for our beer, water, with space for extra food and drinks. I had booked a room facing the courtyard. It is very small, (courtyard), but the room was extremely quiet! Very comfortable bed, bathroom clean and supplied with Body Works.!The hotel allowed us to check out late so we could enjoy the afternoon in the French Quarter for lunch and tour. They also allowed us to leave our car in the car park at no extra charge. Very accomodating to us for everything. The breakfast was very good. I didn't use it much as we had plans to eat in the FRENCH QUARTER. The really good food is there, and plenty of it. Don't worry about the close location to BOURBON STREET, as you hear NOTHING. Great place to stay and very luxurious with the Old World Furnishings. My son was impressed.We are Canadians, and have lived in Louisiana for several years, we still enjoy visiting the Big Easy. We completed our visit in BATON ROUGE for a friends wedding. Enjoyed it all.

<Content>Great time at the Iberville Suites My husband and I just returned from an anniversary holiday in New Orleans. After careful review of hotel accomodations in the area, we settled on the Iberville Suites, located just one block from Bourbon Street.Although we had seen photos of this hotel and read everything we could regarding ammenities, etc., we were a bit leary of what we would experience because the Iberville is so close to the French Quarter. We were more than pleasantly surprised to find this hotel far exceeded our expectations. The Iberville is adjacent to the Ritz Carlton and full access is granted to both hotels.The room itself, located on the 10th floor was quiet, clean, comfortable, and not a speck of dust was found. The lobby is opulent with French period pieces and a lovely grand piano that softly plays. The breakfast, offered between 7:30 to 9:30AM is buffet style with various cereals, waffles, oatmeal, pastries, bagels, english muffins, juices, fruit, tea, and coffee. There is plenty of comfortable seating.The staff, from reservation desk, concierge, housekeeping, and bellmen couldn't have been friendlier or more accomodating. I had a small request in need a of simple safety pin and within minutes received twenty! We opted to take a cab to various places and never had to wait, they are readily available.We consider ourselves seasoned travellers and are quite picky about comfort and cleanliness wherever we go. We would highly reccommend the Iberville Suites. One certainly gets more than the bargain price suggests!

<Content>Not a Good First Impression My wife and I had planned our honeymoon stay at the Iberville Suites. I reserved our room about 6 weeks in advance, and called to confirm that they had our room available. When we checked in to the hotel, everyone was courteous and attentive. Our room was not in keeping with our own expectations however. I had booked a Kingsize room and was given a Standard. If you are used to sleeping on the Kingsize at home, a Standard at a hotel just doesn't work. Our Standard matress was so worn out that it sagged in the middle. Neither of us got a decent sleep the first night there.In the morning, I almost slipped in the bathtub while showering because there was no bathmat or antislip strips in the tub. The carpet in the room was not properly cleaned, and the counter tops had dirt and grime on them. I addressed our complaints to the front desk clerk, and asked to speak to the manager. The manager was not in, so we had to wait until someone came to work. ( I was dismayed that the hotel is run by people who can't make decisions, and no management is there to guide them until they come in.) I had to call the agency that I booked the hotel through before I got a response from a manager. The assistant operations manager was very apologetic about the condition of the room, and guaranteed that all would be taken care of while we were out seeing the sights for the day. When we arrived in the afternoon, we were once again disappointed, because our room had not been cleaned in the six hours that we had been gone. Once again, I called to speak to a manager. The response was very rapid this time. An attendant was sent within 5 minutes to start cleaning our room. The assistant ops manager came up in person to appologize. She offered us a Non-smoking room if we wanted to move to it. Being smokers, we declined. She then offered us a free dinner and drinks at the French Quarter Bar located in The Ritz Carlton next door. WOW! All our complaints were remedied, but we should not have had them to begin with. I had also arranged for flowers to be sent to my wife as a surprise. The people who signed for the flowers had to be tracked down, as they lacked the common sense to bring them to the lobby. I guess they thought the flowers were sent as a gift to them with my wife's name on the box.Next is the $28.00 per day valet parking ripoff. If you don't plan on doing any driving during your stay, then rent the $18.00 per day parking at the Standard Parking garage across the street from the Iberville.I have stayed at the Sheraton on the riverfront, and had a tremendous time at that hotel. Between the two, my next stay will be at the Sheraton. First impressions are hard to make the second time around. BTW, thedinner at The Ritz Carlton French Quarter Bar was superb. They hadan excellent staff, and even adorned our tablecloth with red rose petals.The food was among the best in the French Quarter, and the service from the wait staff was the best we received anywhere in town, period.

<Content>Great French Quarter base Stayed here two nights for business in April and loved it.Somehow I ended up with a wheelchair-accessible room, which gave lots of extra space. Don't know how that happened, but it was their call.Room was nicely appointed, clean and very comfortable. I don't remember much of a view, but you shouldn't be spending much time in your room when in New Orleans anyway.It's adjacent (and owned by) the Ritz-Carlton. I didn't use any of their facilities, but I was told I could.The lobby is small and I don't recall a restaurant, but anyone who eats at a regular hotel restaurant in N.O. should get his head examined anyhow. It's close to a zillion wonderful places to eat and drink as it's on the edge of the quarter, but near some of the busiest parts.This hotel is perfect for anyone who wants Ritz-Carlton style treatment without paying Ritz-Carlton prices.

<Content>Loved the Iberville! We stayed at the Iberville during Jazzfest and were very pleased with this facility. The suite was comfortable for the 4 of us and very quiet. They use Bath  Body Works toiletries and replaced them every day. Housekeeping is definitely hit or miss as we had to call down for washcloths every day but they were responsive once called. The continental breakfast was OK. Charging for high speed data was a huge minus, however, the coffee shop attached to the Ritz Carlton had free wireless which made everything OK again. Having the Iberville attached to the Ritz Carlton was a bonus. The spa facility was VERY nice and they bent over backwards to provide exceptional customer service. We would definitely stay at the Iberville again.

<Content>Better than I expected! I just returned from staying at the Iberville Suites 5/8-5/13/05. I loved it!!I was worried at first because I had read mixed reviews about the hotel. But everything wound up being excellent. The rooms were nice for the price and the staff was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. My husband and I are already planning our return vacation to New Orleans and wouldn't stay anywhere else!!!

<Content>Nice Place! I enjoyed the ambience, the cleanliness and the set up of our room at the Iberville Suites on a recent trip to New Orleans. The staff was gracious and helpful, and the complimentary breakfast was mroe than adequate. I would warn those planning to visit soon that the noise from repairs and resstoration being done to the outside of the building is noisy and starts early! Other than that the place is just about perfect!

<Content>Overbooked... scam!!! We planned our trip way in advance and booked rooms at this hotel because they had suites. When we arrived, they said they were overbooked and the best they could offer was across the street at the Chateau Sonesta (basically, a casino-style hotel....). Some upgrade... no suites, double beds and nasty bathrooms. What a nice first impression of New Orleans. To be honest, I think they do this on a regular basis. A reservation should equal a reserved room - but apparently not in the State of Louisiana! They said that if guests decide to stay an extra day, by law, the hotel cannot kick them out. They sure must have had a lot of people who didn't plan ahead, because we were among MANY who were being kicked nextdoor. (Ya know, at LEAST let me know in advance there's a chance I might not be actually staying in the hotel!)I wouldn't bother reserving a room at the Iberville Suites UNLESS you can get a written guarantee that they'll hold your room. Even then, I don't think they care....

<Content>. . . A Mixed Bag My stay at The Iberville Suites was okay - not great, not awful. Let me list the positive aspects first - nice continental breakfast every morning and great location. In addition, my husband and I enjoyed the spa located in the adjoining Ritz-Carlton hotel. As for the negative aspects - housekeeping services are hit-or-miss; the bed is short if you're over 5'8; the hotel doesn't use fitted sheets on the bed so the bottom sheet comes undone soon after your head hits the pillow; and the window treatments, while very nice to look at, don't do a great job of keeping out sunlight in the morning.all in all, i'd stay at the hotel again but would call ahead to ensure that some of these issues were addressed prior to my arrival.

<Content>Will stay here again Extremely happy with our stay at Iberville Suites. Loved the location, separate bedroom with door, very fast in-and-out parking, pretty  clean room, very quiet hotel guests (but there is loud construction outside hotel currently that begins about 6:30 am), complimentary continental breakfast was a nice touch (unfortunately was pretty well wiped clean about 9:15 am one morning). Please note that you can expect to pay a surcharge of $28 per day for parking, $8 per day for high speed internet (these charges are standard for most N.O. hotels in French Quarter). I highly recommend this hotel for those who desire a great F.Q. location and a quite nice hotel.

<Content>Iberville Suites review After having read a number of reviews, we booked a stay at the Iberville Suites based mainly on the pictures shown on the web site. Over all the hotel lived up to the reviews. The only negative we experienced was with the condition of the room. The carpet, and some of the furnishings do need to be refreshed. Also, we had a backup with the tub drain, which the hotel addressed immediatley . The staff was always helpful. The affillition with the Ritz Carlton was a definite plus. We booked a number of tours thru the concerige, and all of the reccomindations were terrific. I would say overall that our experience was positive, and would recomend the hotel.

<Content>Absolutely loved the Iberville Suites! Just got back from a trip to New Orleans. Been to this great city many times before and have stayed in many different hotels within the French Quarter. I can say that the Iberville Suites is the best we've stayed at yet! The service was excellent, the rooms were clean and very nicely decorated. We will definately stay here again!

<Content>Good Location, Nice Breakfast Buffet, No Complaints After reading through all of the reviews I had my doubts about the Iberville Suites, but we were very pleased with our stay. The location is good, not the best in the Quarter, but still a short walk to most everything. If you want to be near Bourbon Street, it's great because it's only a block away, but very quiet. I would suggest staying more towards the center of the Quarter, like between Royal and Decatur. The Omni Royal O is the ideal location in my opinion.Our room was very nice, a small suite with a separate living room area with a TV, wet bar, and small fridge. The bedroom had it's own TV and a view of a non-descript courtyard. I got the impression that there were few rooms with much of a view of anything special. The room was very quiet and the bed very comfortable - we slept great all three nights we were there. The service was fine, quick check-in and check-out, good maid service. The breakfast buffet was nice for a quick bite. The make-your-own waffle cooker was fun.And of course it is adjacent to the Ritz and their spa, where you can get a good massage or just use the facilities for $10.

<Content>Hands down, best hotel and value in the French Quarter We stayed here for Mardi Gras in 2001. Initially we chose Iberville Suites because of the price. We were pleasantly surprised to find that because it was attached to the Ritz Carlton, we received 5 star service. Last time we were there, they had the best soaps and shampoos (bath and body works) and the most comfortable beds. We had a quick valet, and whenever we had a problem, the staff was very attentive. We even had an issue, where we locked our valuables in the hotel safe, and forgot the electronic code. Not only did the staff respond quickly, but they were friendly and accomodating in resolving the problem. We will be going back this year for our wedding, we can't wait to stay there again.

<Content>Iberville Suites in New Orleans wow....Went to New Orleans first part of march 2005. Was there for our anniversary and when booking the trip had no idea where to stay. After tons of research settled on the Iberville Suites which is connected to thr Ritz Carlton. WOW What an amazing hotel and better yet was the location. 2 blocks from Bourbon St so had NO noise in the hotel. 1 Block from canal st Just a short walk through the beautiful French Quarter to Cafe du monde. It was an amazing trip. My wife and I have decided that When we go back we will with out a doubt stay at the Iberville suites again!! What a Great city...the food, music, sightseeing, all the history in that town it is wonderful!!!! We were cautioned about petty thefts and pick pocketers so at night we stayed on well lit streets and had NO problems...actually found everyone there to be extremely friendly! If you love food...then this is the place for you!

<Content>Thought It Was GREAT! This was our third trip to New Orleans, and this hotel is by far the best one! It is only one block from Bourbon Street, and the suite rooms are very nice. The bed was wonderful, I slept great. My two sons loved the spa at the Ritz Carlton, as did I! We also used the hot tub at the Ritz and their lap pool. The continental breakfast was nice, and included freshly made waffles. For the price, this was a great bargain!

<Content>Enjoyed our stay My wife and I spent our 10th Anniversary at the Iberville Suites in New Orleans this past March. The hotel is conveniently located at the foot of the French Quarter. We were immediately greeted by a hospitable rep at the front desk. The lobby is tastefully decorated, and the halls on each of the floors are well maitained. The room consisted of a living room with a convertible sofa, chair and desk. The room also included a seperate kitchenette area with refrigerator, sink and coffeemaker. The bedroom had a king sized bed and the bathroom was large and clean. There were 2 phones and 2 televisions, each in the bedroom and living room. Breakfast was complimetary and included assorted muffins, danish, bagels, english muffins, as well as waffles, coffee, OJ, etc. On our Anniversary, chocolate covered strawberries were delivered to our room (without being requested!). Housekeeping and Valet were extremely pleasant and helpful. Guests have siging rights at the spa and restaurants located at the Ritz-Carlton located next door. Thr room was $139 a night, but Friday's rate was $159. I've stayed in hotels all over the world and I considered the Iberville Suites a good value. I highly recommend the Iberville Suites. There were very few downsides but here you go -- The view from our bedroom was of a delapidated building undergoing rennovations. If it's a view you want, you wont get one here. Make sure you request a view overlooking the interior courtyard. Don't expect a granduer foyer or entrance way. As a matter of fact, if you weren't looking, you might just pass the hotel. Once inside, you have to take an elevator up 1 flight to the main lobby, then transfer to another elevator to your floor. Considering the price, location, and service, this minor inconvenience is well worth it.

<Content>Great place to stay! We visited New Orleans in March 2005. We read the reviews on TripAdvisor and decided on the Iberville Suites. However, we could not get 4 nights at the Iberville. So we decided to book the Iberville for 2 nights and look for another similar hotel for the last 2 nights.After much looking and reading TripAdvisor comments, we settled for the Dauphine Orleans because it was about the same price, and it looked, at the time, seems to be about the same as the Iberville. It was not!The Iberville Suites - Great location. We walked the French Quarter from the Iberville with no problems. Very nice room/bed, very comfortable. Staff very friendly. Breakfast is included with hot oatmeal, cook-your-self walfle, yogurt, juices, hot coffee/tea, rolls/toast fruits, etc. In room wired internet access is $13 from midnight to midnight (1 day). I preferto have wireless access.Dauphine Orleans - Great location. Just down the street from the Iberville. Very friendly staff. Breakfast is included (same variety as the Iberville). Afternoon tea and sweet at the lounge from 3PM - 5PM. There is a small pool, but the water was too cold. The air vent in the room we stayed in blows the air directly at the head of the bed. So we had to just turn it off and open the window when sleeping. The bed, the sheets and blanket were of a Motel 6 class. It does not have in-room internet access. But does have free wireless internet access from the office, lounge and pool area.Since the cost was about the same between the Iberville Suites and Dauphine Orleans, I would expect that they are comparable. But they are not. I would definitely stay at the Iberville Suites again.I would caution those who may be thinking staying right on, or next to Bourbon street. The street gets very noisy from the evening into the night with lould music from bars and stores and people! Unless, of course, that does not bother you!

<Content>A fine hotel in a fine location at a bargain price If you are looking for a full service hotel, the Ritz amenities provide that (at an additionl cost). But this is really an exceptional value fot those who are willing to venture out but want luxurious accommodations in a prime location at a reasonable cost.The breakfast buffet is mediocre, but who cares, you will end up overeating in NO anyways, so save some room at breakfast. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms far above average, especially for the price. The location is central to everything and you can even use the Ritz indoor pool if you choose.

<Content>Very average hotel - convenient for families We have just returned from Mardi Gras. I find hotel reviews on this site so helpful that I decided to return the favor. The Iberville suites is conveniently located just inside the French Quarter, a block from Canal. We stayed here because the continental breakfast was convenient as we have a 2 year old. (Muffins, make-your-own waffles, bagels, juice, milk, coffee, yogurt and fruit). The hotel is plain and simple - adequate and average. The suites are small - a small room with Queen or King bed, and another small room with foldout. There were two tv's, also convenient with a child. If cleanliness is really important to you - don't stay here. I am not a neatness fanatic, but compared to other stays at hotels (and we travel a lot), the room was barely cleaned. The bed was made and towels changed, but no picking up or vacuuming. We also waited an inordinate amount of time for service when the toilet stopped up. Of course, it was Mardi Gras - but still for $200 a night, they can hire people to clean. And, the hotel was well staffed to boot. Only other thing to comment on was the strange staff. The bellman and doorman are fantastic. The people who work at the breakfast were also very nice. The desk staff though - not a smile among them in four days. I have never, ever passed by a hotel front desk - empty, and not received a smile or a good day or something. It was odd.   I have stayed at the Hotel Dauphine and the Holiday Inn on Dauphine as well. For the same money, those two hotels were a better value.

<Content>Very Cozy Hotel Dispite the view of the dark vacant warehouse directly across from our room window, this hotel was wonderful. No it didn't have a full breakfast buffet, but they did have muffins, self prepared waffles, assorted juices, cereals and more. I would definetly stay here again, in fact my husband and I are planning another trip to New Orleans. The rooms are very comfortable, and cozy. We made it to New Orleans on a Monday Morning and parked the car in the garage across the street $18 bucks a night :( . We left that Thursday and had not touched our car. No need to drive everything is in walking distance. Oh yeah, they don't tell you at the iberville suites that parking is $28 a night. The hotel has a great location just one block from Burbon street, and a few blocks from the aquarium, and one block from Canal street. If you need directions just go to the third floor of the Ritz Carlton (which is adjacent to Iberville Suites) go to the concierge, and they will give you a map.

<Content>Very nice and very quiet My husband and I were there from Dec 26 - 29, the hotel was awsome, the suite was clean and the staff very friendly. The location fo the hotel was perfect, very close to the streetcar line and Burbon street. We were surprised to find it very quiet also and private. We would not hesitate to stay here again. The occation of our 10th anniversary was the reason we went to NO, that and so see a football game. The hotel aknowledged our anniversary with chocolates, needless to say we were surprised.

<Content>.....Absolutely, without a doubt !!!!! My wife and I just returned from a 4-night stay at the Iberville Suites Jan 14-18. After reading the many reviews of this hotel at TripAdvisor, we were anxious to live out our own review regarding the quality of the hotels amenities and the status of the now infamous buffet breakfast. Having previously stayed at other French Quarter hotels, we were prepared for the traditional lack of space and noise associated with a close proximity to Bourbon Street. Let me be the first to say, however, that our experience on both points was very postive. The spaciousness of the suites was just right. The sitting room was perfect for lounging and relaxing after a day of sight-seeing, walking Bourbon Street (1 block away), and 'experiencing' Harrah's. We also experienced absolutely no noise pollution from Bourbon Street. The entire hotel was classy and very well-appointed. Finally, the buffet breakfast. No, you will not find eggs or bacon, but, YES, the breakfast is FREE and includes all of the fruit, oatmeal, cereal, self-prepared waffles, bagels, etc you can handle to get your day started...Lisa Johnson made sure of that. Would we stay again???....ABSOLUTLEY, without a doubt!

<Content>Great place to stay Just returned from a New Orleans get a way. We are very familiar with New Orleans. We loved the French Quarter location. Close enough to Bourbon Street yet away from the fray. The rooms were in decent shape. They were not large suites such as an Embassy Suites but there was enough room for us ( 2 adults  1 child). The rooms were very quite. We never heard any hallway type noise. The bathrooms were very nice.The lobby was spacious. The decor feels like an old New Orleans Uptown mansion. We really enjoyed the feel of the lobby.Everyone was super friendly  helpful.The breakfast was nothing to write homne about but it was something  it was decent. We would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Been there 4 times now and wouldnt go anywhere else I could not believe the bad review I read about this Hotel. The last thing you will find is the lobby or any other part of the Hotel is that it is in need of service. It is beautifully maintained, the staff are very professional and bend over backwards to help if you have a problem. You may find a vending machine or ATM down once in awhile but that is normal for any place. It is in a great location, people say 1 or 2 blocks from bourbon but it is more like a half city block. You walk out the front door to the corner (takes all of 1 minute if that) cross the street, walk down a short city block (end block) and there you are. The breakfast has changed since my last stay but is still very good and it is free. Use of the Ritz amenities make it even better. The beds are dreamy and topped with lots of pillows and even more pillows in the closet. The safe is free to use, not like other places where they charge you. There are 2 TVs and a mini bar with fridge and all the other little extras like iron and iron board, coffee maker etc. I have checked out other Hotels in the French Quarter and feel this is the best you will find for your money. When I last left NO they were doing a face lift to the outside of the Hotel. Remember this Hotel is actually the back half of the Ritz and they do thier best to stay right up there with them. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

Seems like a small item, but everyone was talking about this. The rooms do need attention. The front desk needs additional personnel. We paid $109 for 2 people. Never tried the continental breakfast because there is so much other good food to experience. Even breakfast. You can use all of the facilities at the adjacent Ritz, which is great at Christmas.

The suites are somewhat small and the furniture is a tad worn, but the marble bath and absolutely gorgeous artwork are worth the stay. The lobby is small but very lovely, and the continental breakfast was worth getting up after a night on Bourbon.The location is GREAT in relation to everything downtown; however, with construction going on currently on Iberville and the Ritz, it can be a hassle trying to access the lobby entrance with your vehicle.We would stay here again!

This place is not only beautiful, along with free hot buffet breakfast and close (not too close) to the noise on Bourbon Street. The price we paid was beyond reasonable. Since I've paid more for other places not in the French Quarter. Definitely worth it if you can get a good price for the rooms. Perfect location and helpful staff. I've recommended it to many friends and they've all had the same reaction--A gem! Search around for the best prices on-line.

<Content>An Easy Choice When Staying In The Big Easy We enjoyed our 5 night stay at Iberville Suites. The location is perfect: 2 blks from Bourbon St., close enough to walk everywhere but away from the noise (especially late night on weekends); 1 blk from Canal St.  the Canal and St. Charles Street Car lines which gave inexpensive access to all our planned destinations. The suite was very comfortable. The mini-fridge let us store cold beverages for chilling out after a long day or night on the town. The sitting room being separated from the bedroom by the kitchenette  bathroom allowed me to catch some late night t.v. while my wife hit the pillows. The bellmen were very friendly  helpful with directions and dining recommendations (more so than the front desk staff). Concierge service is available from the Ritz Carlton next door (also very friendly  helpful). Best of all, the rates were excellent, under $100 for the week nights (but much higher for the weekend nights!) Complimentary breakfast buffet was well stocked and good. No hot dishes like eggs, etc., but with waffle batter and griddle for make-ur-own waffles. For us, Iberville Suites was an ideal place to stay in the French Quarter.

<Content>A Nice Stay This is a nice hotel. Marble floors, nice artwork and decor. Located in the French Quarter, we got a deal for $99 per nite. The suite itself is nice--always good to have a pullout couch and two televisions. The view wasn't that great, and we had some trouble with the lock on our door, but otherwise the service and the hotel itself was more than satisfactory. With regard to the continental breakfast, it is deluxe in that there are cereals, breads, fruit, yogurt, and you can make your own waffles. That was a nice touch. For the price we paid, definately a nice stay.

Our train was delayed, so I phoned the Iberville at 4p to make sure that my accommadations were guaranteed for late arrival. I was assured that my suite would be available when we arrived. We were greeted by a very nice Bellman that informed us that our accommodations had been upgraded.(i.e. my suite was not available, they overbooked!!!) My heart sunk; here I am traveling with four other people(a 3 and 7 yr old included) and no suite. Edward did offer an upgrade at the Ritz Carlton, but his offer was for a king room and not a suite. After about 20 min of discussion, Edward magically found us a suite. Great right? No, when we unlocked the door the room was already occuppied. We go back downstairs and share this vital information with Edward, who couldn't understand how this could possibly happen. I then asked to speak with the manager on duty. I was only allowed to speak to her after Loss Prevention verified that someone else had their belongings in the room.(30 min later) After speaking with the MOD(Ritz Carlton), who was very apologetic we ended up in a suite at the Ritz-Carlton with complimentary room-service for the evening. The Iberville seems to be a very nice hotel, however I do think they overbook a lot.

<Content>A good value At $89 a night, we thought the suite w/king bed was a very good value, especially given the location within the French Quarter. The room was very clean and nicely appointed, and had a large bathroom. We certainly had no problems with housekeeping. It was also nice to have a TV in both the living area and the bedroom, and to have a small refridgerator as well. The only downside was that there is renovation going on, and the construction noise started up rather early. If you are a late sleeper, make sure the construction is finished before you book. The continental breakfast was pretty much the same as you would find in most mid-priced hotels, so expect to go out for breakfast if you want standard breakfast fare. The person at the reception desk was friendly and efficient. The parking valets were also quite friendly as well, and were very quick in retrieving our car (be aware that parking is $28 an night). Since there are so many places to stay in N.O., I'm not sure if we would stay here again, but overall we would have to say that we were satisfied with our stay, and would have no hesitation in staying again or recommending this hotel to friends.

<Content>Great Stay, Great Location, Great Price This is a wonderful hotel whether you visit with kids or come for a romantic holiday. The king suites are spacious and comfortable and have touches of elegance. If you are patient and respectful with the staff they will work with you. We booked our room through Expedia (excellent rate $85 for a weeknight)) and I guess that the block of rooms set aside for Expedia was on the 10th floor whch was being renovated. The hallway carpets were covered in plastic and there were workers all over the floor. We went back downstairs and asked for another floor. We were given a room on the 7th floor which was supposed to be non smoking but reeked of smoke. Finally on our third try we got a great room in a great location. The staff was very willing to help us out.The breakfast was wonderful and is more then he usual continental breakfast.

<Content>Just average Overall the experience wasn't all I had hoped for. I went for my bachelorette party and booked a King Suite. Too bad our flight got in late and we didn't arrive until after 11 p.m., because the front desk attendant explained that our room was unavailable. All they could offer us was a room with two double beds, which wasn't such a big deal, but it wasn't a suite. Of course there was no price break for the downgrade, and he said that while he didn't want to really go into it, somewhere in fine print on the reservation it says that the room you book isn't guaranteed. He also didn't bother to go into the times for breakfast, where anything was, etc. In fact, when we came back in later on from going out, he was asleep at the desk. Although the room was nice, it was a lot smaller than what I booked and paid for. (I did get to peek into one of the King Suites and it was a lot nicer). Finally, upon checkout they tried to charge me about 30% higher than the rate I booked. This did get fixed, but the whole process took about 20 minutes. While the stay wasn't terrible, it just wasn't that great either. Last year for another friend's b-party we stayed at the Royal Sonesta and that was much, much nicer! Oh well, I will definitely be going back to N.O., but I doubt that I will ever stay at the Iberville again.

<Content>It's as reviewed by most...... First thank you to all who provided some feedback on their experience at the Iberville Suites. I just returned from a long weekend (3 night stay) there. Like most reviewers stated, the place was not up to par of a Ritz Carlton hotel, the furniture was old and warn so was the art work in the suites. The breakfast was just a basic continental high carb, served on styrofoam plates and cups. There was no eggs, bacon or sausage.The dinning areas isn't what you see on the website, actually that dinning area is located in the Ritz Carlton. The room was a good size for two people, I enjoyed having a living area to rest and converse with vistors, while my room was a few feet away. So that was cozy and somewhat homely.The service was really average, on one occasion I asked the front desk for assistance on the VisiPass offered by the local Regional Transit Auth. in NO, she had no clue and suggested I contact the concierge. I went next door to the Ritz and before I even got to the desk their front desk staff was ready to assist me. The staff was helpful, they called nearby hotels that provided the service and had them hold a pass for me. Finally, if you are really use to and demand the quality of the Ritz *do not stay at Iberville* but if you want the idea of luxury just for the show then the Iberville Suites isn't bad, unless you can get a suite like hotel for that low price.

<Content>Enjoyed the Hotel!! It is my pleasure to write a great review of this hotel! I stayed with two kids who slept on the pull out sofa. My king bed was very comfy and the sheets and towels were nice and plush. Bed Bath and Bodyworks toiletries- great! Two tv's so the kids could watch their shows while I watched mine!We had no problems with housekeeping- although we were out walking around the city all day! I could hear the elevator a bit- but it is an older building- not enough to keep me awake- but I would recommend reserving a room away from the elevators. We did have a beautiful view from our room- 7th floor if I remember correctly- just loved it!I ended up staying days longer than expected- so I saved some $$ by parking at the supermarket near the police station during the day and moving my car to the street in the evenings as by then it was free, and close to the hotel as the streets clear out after 5-6pm. We walked everywhere- so you know it was not far to anything as I walked with little kids. We ate dinner at Bubba Gumps a lot as the kids liked it there. Enjoyed the childrens museum a lot.Hotel staff were gracious and kind, comfortable room *very* nice for the price and location- but I do have to say I was there when they had the full buffet- I would miss that for it was truly lovely.

<Content>Perfect Quarter Hotel... Myself, husband and two children under 7 stayed at the Iberville for 4 nights in mid-june. In town for a family wedding. My husband grew up in NO - he and his siblings know NO and the Quarter extremely well; perhaps that is why we had such a great time. The Iberville staff was extremely pleasant to deal with. While I agree with some minor complaints from other reviews (yes, housekeeping IS extremely slow) overall we had an excellent stay. No, this isn't the Ritz but you get the amenities of a Ritz hotel (spa, exercise facilitites, etc) for just $10 per day - that's per room, NOT per person, and at 139 per night you can't beat the price. The spa is fabulous. The workout facilities are not big but state of the art and the staff doesn't know which hotel you are staying in so they treat everyone the same. Yes, the buffet breakfasts have been discontinued, but a call to a manager of the hotel on this subject and the $25 fee per person for more than 2 adults per room (this applied to other family members in town for the wedding) was waived. We also requested discounted valet parking fees and they were reduced by 50% on the spot! The hotel itself is old but in pretty good shape. We didn't have the greatest view from our 10th floor suite but that wasn't really important for us. The kids had a blast in the resistance pool and we pretty much had it to ourselves. The location is perfect if you like to walk and not bad for cabbing or driving. We will definitely stay there again for our next trip to NO. For those of you considering the Iberville, my suggestion is to get the manager's name before arriving so you have a contact if something is not to your liking. Our experience was that they were willing to do just about anything to make our stay memorable. We dealt with them with patience  respect and they took care of us!

<Content>you get what you pay for I stayed for a week in May and, yes, it's a great location (1 blk away from the french quarter), and it is (mostly) quiet , but, it's an older building and you get what you pay for, as they say.The lobby has plenty of sofas and chairs, but you can see the aged look in the furniture, the walls, the moldings - it's not quite what I had expected.For example, one morning I was greeted by a wet ceiling in the main lobby. Staff had managed to pull away the rugs and place a bucket underneath to prevent further water damage. I could tell that this was not the first such occurrence. The building is showing it's age.As far as the complimentary breakfast, well, I never saw eggs or bacon - just fruits, breads, muffins, and, of course, oatmeal! The coffee was well, I really prefer Cafe du Monde. And hey, you can get a decent breakfast just three blocks up the street at Mena's cafe.As far as the room, it was clean, roomy, but the bed had seen better days. The towels were very rough (not quite sandpaper), but they were in ample supply, and yes, the linens were clean (thank god!).

The room had no seperation like they told me on the phone, the staff were all very rude!!! including the bellhop and front desk, the free b-fast was just like the items they serve at a holiday inn and the whole place was just bad.

<Content>Decent hotel We stayed at the Iberville suites on Memorial Day wkend of '04. The hotel itself was aesthically nice. The front desk service was very polite and accomodating. Our rooms were the basic suite, separte living room, separate bedroom and separate bathroom. The kitchen was in between the living room and bathroom hall. I was very pleased to see that there were enough towels and toiletries to last a day. Our view was the courtyard which made our stay very quiet and away from the main scene. The complementary breakfast was very surprising. It is the daily generic muffins, bagels, oatmeal, cereal boxes and Orange Juice but compared to other types of hotels, I didn't have a problem with their complementary breakfast at the Iberville.I would defly stay here again if I choose New Orleans as my destination.

<Content>Warning things are not as advertised at the Iberville Suites I stayed w/ my family at the Iberville Suites April 11- 14, 2004 based on previous reviews. MISTAKE! Let's start with the complimentary breakfast. It was no different than anywhere else. Muffins, cereal in a box, and plastic ware. They actually confessed that they were not serving specific items like grits, oatmeal, and sausage as a cost savings measure. Housekeeping was sloooooow and incomplete. They didn't clean the room until 3:00 pm on one occasion. On another occasion they did not change the towels. Also, one evening the staff decides to run a carpet cleaning machine at 11:30 pm. Of course called the front desk and the machine continued to run until midnight. Lastly, I valet parked my rental and upon returning it I discovered that the rear molding was damaged. Had to happen at the I-suites lot since we used the car very sparingly.If this is Ritz Carlton service, then they can have it!

<Content>Disappointing Stayed at the Iberville on 13th - 15th of April. Chose this accommodation on the basis of reviews from this site, however despite the glowing reviews I have read about them I feel I have to say how disappointing our stay there was. They served completary breakfast -- It was decent but what was on offer daily was the same type of food--same type of muffins, bagels, fruit and cereal in cartons!!. There was no variation at all. What was very was annoying about was all their serving plates and cups and cutlery were all plastic!!! So much for conserving the world's resources!!!I expected better as this as the hotel is managed by the Ritz they should have a t least ceramic if not porcelain serving dishes and decent cutlery. If this was a cost saving measure for the hotel I am afraid that it goes down really badly. The housekeeping service was very slow. We expected our rooms to have been cleaned by at least mid afternoon , but on the second day it took me four phone calls throughout the day and by the time they were able to clean the room and make up the bed  change it was 8PM!! Reception staff were polite but not very friendly. Our room was on the 7th floor and right outside our window as wa workman's lift and every morning at 8 pm the noise generated by this lift woke me up --so much for a lie-in!! The only advantage of Iberville Suites is the extra room one gets with the accommodation provided.

Also, surprisingly quiet in the rooms.The service was friendly although we had some problems getting our luggage to our room which shouldn't be very hard for the hotel to handle.We never used the Ritz facilities though $10 seems pretty reasonable to use their pool and workout facilities.

<Content>Lap of luxury! Just returned from Iberville Suites with our 3 children ages 7, 4  2 and must say we were spoiled for 5 days! This was a perfect location as we only got our car out twice! You can even walk to the aquarium! Walking around in the French Quarter/Jackson Square (we did Ripleys Believe it or Not!) was exciting but we felt grubby after being on the streets all day and coming home to the Iberville was the perfect complement to the long days! Our room was always stocked with special Bath  Body Works bath supplies each day and we even had a cordless phone in room! Everything was meticulously clean/fresh! Like the other reviews, I agree about it being quiet! We didn't even hear other guests!!! The resistance pool and whirlpool was a great escape from the bustling city and fresh fruit was even offered in the excercise room!!! The full breakfast was eggs/bacon each day and I usually took it up to the room as I am the early riser! The rooms have mini fridges, so extras could be stored. We loved the Iberville Suites and can't wait to return!

My stay at iberville was wonderful. the wonderfull doormen/valet who were nice freandly and sweet, they had no problem with the oversized truck with a wheelchair holder on back. when you walk into the entrance to the hotel the first thing you smell is cloves, the decorating is beautiful, then you go up the slowest one story elevator i have ever seen. when you exit the elevator you get the nice lobby, it is decorrated beauitfully and they have a player piano in it, they only complaint i see is the bathroom had no soap? the balconies were beautiful. the room was a bit small but they made up for it with the soft pull out bed. then rooms were clean and the place was wonderful.

<Content>A Great Deal! I booked this after reading the reviews on this site. I paid $139 through the hotel's website for a suite. It was by far the best deal I found for a nice and highly rated (AAA 4 star) hotel in the quarter. The suite was a great size (living room and king size bed in the bed room w/ TV's in both rooms) and the breakfast (free, included in the price of the room) make this hotel great.

<Content>Simpy Wonderful Spent four days at the Iberville Suites. From the minute we arrived, we were treated so well by the staff. They checked us in five hours early and were very helpful with directions. The room was fabulous; very large, clean, and quiet. I don't know that you would get as much for your money anywhere in the French Quarter. The morning breakfast was very nice. Our three year old enjoyed the pool and I enjoyed the spa at the Ritz. Room service was very quick and the food was delicious.

We liked having a TV in the living room and also one in the bedroom. The sheets and mattress were wonderful. We also liked having a door to close between the living room and bedroom. It was only one block from Bourbon Street. I am already looking forward to my next visit to New Orleans and the Iberville Suites.

<Content>Warm, Friendly Service with a smile! When booking my trip through Expedia I was pleasantly surprised to find a 4 star hotel at a really great price. The Iberville Suites was every bit what I expected. The rooms were spacious and well furnished. The breakfast was outstanding. There was more than enough to go around and it was a FULL BUFFET, not just a donut and coffee. It was also a plus being allowed to use the Ritz-Carlton facilities. The hotel is located in the heart of the French Quarter and liteally minutes from nearly everything in the Quarter. However, the best part of the Iberville Suites was the staff. They were warm and friendly and always helpful. My wife celebrated her birthday at the hotel and the staff had just as much fun helping me plan my birthday surprise as I did! It was so nice to say thank you to the staff and hear my pleasure as a response. My hat is off to the staff at the Iberville Suites. A hotel is just a hotel unless you have a great staff behind it. Thank you Iberville.

<Content>Superb value This was such a great place to stay. It is part of the Ritz Carlton chain and it lived up to its parent company's reputation. It was about the only place I could find suites in the quarter, and the price I got through AAA (119 a night) was below most regular rooms in the vicinity.Their breakfast buffet was incredible and despite being only a bloc or so off of bourbon it was insanely quiet. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially anyone looking for divisible space.

We used this website to review the hotel prior to purchasing the package and found that the reviews were accurate. However, our experience was even better than the reviews. The hotel is elegant, classy and very convienently located within the French Quarter. The room was clean and adequately stocked everyday. Staff were also very helpful and courteous. Buffet breakfast was pretty good and room service was even better. Although we did not use the Ritz Carlton services very much, the Concierge was very helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fabulous hotel at a great bargain! A friend and I just returned from a four night stay at the Iberville Suites from February 12-16. We were attending a meeting, and opted for the Iberville instead of the meeting hotel after getting a fantastic deal on Expedia (four nights hotel and RT air from Detroit for $420 per person). We were pleasantly surprised by the extremely friendly employees. Everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping staff would not pass by without saying hello or how are you. Coming from Detroit, this is unusual for us! The rooms were large and very comfortable. I especially enjoyed the complimentary Bath and Bodyworks toiletries! The complimentary breakfast was awesome - we expected some muffins and juice but were impressed by the large spread they put out. All our other friends who stayed elsewhere were jealous of the fantastic hotel. I would definitely stay there the next time I'm in New Orleans!

<Content>No complaints, loved it, will return this fourth of July!!! This hotel was an all around great place to stay. I must admit, at first I was a little worried staying here because I had not heard of the chain before. Being this close to the French Quarter there shaky margin can be pretty high. However, upon arriaval my fears were quickly dispelled. Our check in was prompt, and the staff was friendly. This hotel is managed and staffed by the Ritz Carlton. The same building houses the Iberville, Ritz Carlton, and the Masion Orleans. The breakfast buffet was cause enough to stay again. When arriving at the airport, Look for a limousine driver named nelson. The bell captain provided us his service to and from our hotel.

<Content>recommend to stay in french quarter we stayed here from 12/27/03 to 1/5/04, it was our first visit to new orleans and it is an amazing time to go(new years and the sugar bowl). we took the airport shuttle to the hotel it was about $50 for 2 of us round trip. the hotel was in an excellent location, it was 2 blocks away from bourbon but far enough away that you didnt hear anything. we walked everywhere french market, cafe du monde, jackson square, riverwalk, cemeteries, canal street, streetcars (which took us to the garden district for 1.25 a person)hell we even walked to the superdome for the sugar bowl. the location probably cant be beat. as for the hotel the breakfast was good but it was kind of packed and pretty hard to find a place to sit and eat so a few days i just grabbed a coffee and muffin and brought it back to our room. the room is pretty spacious, it was a 2 room suite so it had a fridge, pull out couch, 2 televisions and a sink in the kitchen area. the bedroom was kind of small and there was not enough room to place your clothes but i was actually expecting a smaller space before we got there. one other note, you have to take a elevator to the 2nd floor where the lobby is and then you have to take another elevator to the room(which is kind of a pain after having too many drinks on bourbon street). i would recommend this place in a heartbeat for anyone looking to stay in the quarter but you want some peace and quiet too

<Content>Front Desk, Okay Everything Else..Great! We found a great rate through the Iberville Suites website however, I would recommend calling them directly because later on when we had problems the manager told us she couldn't take anything off of our rate because we booked it through the internet. The hotel is beautiful. We were very impressed with the room also. The front desk service was lacking since it did take us about 3 hours AFTER check in to finally get into our room. And this was after we told the front desk clerk that we needed to speak to the manager. The manager was great and gave us a $65 credit to use towards room service breakfast the next morning. When we did order breakfast it was wonderful!! All in all, if we find another rate like this I'm sure we'll take advantage of it!

<Content>Great Hotel We got a quote on a rate and decided to give it a try. We were surprise how nice the room was. We had a two room suite that everything you could want. The hotel is about two blocks from Bourbin Street. From the hotel we were able to walk to Jackson Square, the French Market, and the Riverwalk. The French Market and the Riverwalk was somewhat a long walk but very enjoyable. Plenty of shops, restaurants, and bars along the way to visit and rest. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially if you can get a good rate. Our rate was cheaper than the any on Bourbin St. It was also cheaper than the Hilton or Sheraton on Canal and every bit as nice.

<Content>Iberville - Home Away From Home Got a great deal for the Iberville Suites on Expedia.com, but we really had no idea how great a deal it was until we got there. We stayed for five days over Christmas week, and the Iberville was the highlight of our trip. New Orleans is always wonderful, but the Iberville puts the icing on the cake. Whatever the day brought, we could not wait to return to our home at the Iberville. Suites are classy, warm, clean, and comfortable with great amenities. Breakfast is included and NOT a continental roll with coffee. This is a full buffet with GREAT food. But best of all is the staff of the Iberville. There people are warm, gracious, classy and TRUELY care about your stay. They are very proud of their hotel, as they should be. We've stayed several places in New Orleans - - but our search is over. The Iberville is here to stay - - -

<Content>the service! the decor! the location! My companion and i were incredibly pleased with the Iberville Suites during our stay in New Orleans. Every staff member we encountered, from the doorman to the front desk clerk to the housekeeper, was friendly and helpful.Our suite was perfectly lovely and offered plenty of space for the two of us to relax in the living area after long days spent walking the French Quarter. The sumptuous dark wood furniture was obviously well cared-for and the rest of the decor was a tasteful indication (rather than a loud statement) that yes, we were in New Orleans.As others have mentioned the Iberville does provide Bath and Body Works toiletries. i did not bring any of my own items and i was pleased to find that i did not need to. Shampoo, conditioner, and two types of soap are all generously provided and replenished as they are used.The breakfast provided by the Iberville is also generous and pleasing. Croissants and various pastries, eggs, bacon, potatoes, fruit, cereals, bead and bagels for toasting, yogurt, and of course the Belgian waffle makers. Juice, milk, coffee, and the makings for tea and hot chocolate were also provided.Breakfast seating in the vast lobby can be a challenge at peak times, but i enjoyed the luxury of lounging at a couch or chair and ottoman. There are a variety of spots to enjoy breakfast or even simply while away some time at any hour of the day in the various conversational and traditional table seating areas.All in all, i would highly recommend the Iberville to anyone simply on its own merits. If one is expecting to make use of the Spa and Lounge services offered by the joint Ritz-Carlton so much the better, but i surely felt surrounded by luxury at the Iberville Suites as it was.

<Content>Another good hotel in the Quarter This is another very good hotel in the Quarter. It is in a fairly quiet part of the Quarter but only a block from Bourbon St. and a block off Canal St. All of the Quarter, the shopping sections of Canal and Riverwalk, and the streetcar are an easy walk. The staff was fine and unobtrusive. The suites are very nicely furnished but small and a trifle dark. No views to speak of from the rooms. The included, buffet breakfast was very pleasant, with excellent, abundant food (hot and cold) and a pleasant dining area. This is a very good property, one of many in the Central Business District and the Quarter. With a charge of over $200/night it was not a good deal and could be bested by many other properties.

<Content>Elegant/Great Location What a little gem! My 2 friends and I shared a suite at the Iberville 10/6 to 10/10. The suite was small but just right for 3 people. My only complaint was that they would not give us 2 beds in the bedroom. We had a king and a pull out couch in the living room. Two of us had to sleep together. The rooms were clean and modern. The staff was excellent. Great buffet breakfast every morning. Excellent location in the Quarter. You are a short walking distance from the main area but far enough away from the noise of Bourbon street. There is a great place to eat right up the block called Deannie's if you don't feel like going far. They do take out too! I would definitely recommend this hotel. When ever I come back to the Big Easy I will be staying at Iberville Suites.

<Content>lovely hotel,good service Just come back from a 3 night stay at the Iberville suites and it was great,nice room though it was a bit too small for 4 of us and a bit dusty in places but that was the only downside.I'm just a bit reluctant to give it all 5 stars as we stayed in an even better hotel on our travels. The breakfast was really nice and the staff were friendly and helpful.The location is perfect,1 block from Bourbon street but seemed a million miles away,it was so quiet!I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Mixed Feelings I have mixed feelings about the Iberville Suites... It was a very nice hotel for a great price... the room was spacious and had nice amenities... it was not spotless (there were old ice pops in the freezer), and we did have problems communicating with the maid service (b/c some of them did not speak English!) When we checked in... they held $600 in my checking account for incidental charges... I understand they have to hold some money... but I had no idea they would freeze this much money in my account! Overall, the stay was nice. The main problem happened after I left.. a week after my stat, I noticed a charge on my account of $111 from the Ritz-Carlton (who handles Iberville's finances) I called them, and they said they accidentally charged a no-show charge to my account.. and that it would be credited back to my account.. a few days later they only credited only $102.. frustrated.. I called back, and they said they couldn't find any of the charges and that I had to send proof! I stopped being polite, and said that I shouldn't have to do anything, and they said they would call me back... I'm still waiting for the call

<Content>Louisiana Native Arrived on Saturday with 2 daughters , 3 grandchildren and 1 wife. Superb Hotel Rooms and showers as clean as home! The rooms/suites are spacious! Employees are the most courteous and helpful I have every encountered in New Orleans. Breakfast Buffet is excellent! Location is great! Parking in and out is above average but pricey! Rates are very competitive

<Content>Iberville Suites I loved Iberville Suites! The location was wonerful. We were only 1 or 2 short blocks to Bourbon, and all of the other French Quarter attractions. We were also able to catch the streetcar about a block or 2 away. The hotel was beautiful, loved the bath and body works lotions, soap, etc... Free breakfast was great too. Eggs, bacon, grits, hashbrowns, fruit, muffins, HUGE waffles, cereal and more!! Great rates too. We got a buy 2 nights get 1 free rate from the hotel website. Great Stay!!

<Content>Great value in a great location The Iberville Suites shares the old Maison Blanche building with the Ritz Carlton. I think the inside is fairly new- at least it looks that way. The staff was great, the suite we stayed in was the perfect size for us (but could be small for a family of 4), it was very clean and it was 2 blocks off Bourbon St. and one block off Canal St. Every morning from 6:30-9:30 they have a great breakfast buffet: scrambled eggs, grits, bacon, fruit, yogurt, bagels, coffee, etc. etc. We'd go back in a heartbeat. If you're looking for great accomodations that are quiet, close to the heart of the Quarter, and reasonably priced, this is it.
