<Content>Not the best and not a boutique hotel Stayed at the Capitol Hotel as my last stop in Australia, loved Sydney but not this hotel. It is a basic three star and the fact that it is owned by Rydges is quite surprising. Definetly not a boutique hotel unless this is the ambition. Certainly the work and transformation had not started during my stay in July.First impression was not good the reception area has a sterile youth hostel feel about it. The girl on reception was okay but no Aussie welcome. During my stay I would say some staff here where polite and friendly while others had little motivation in their job. Stayed in room 514, which was compact and comfortbale but nothing special. Bathroom very small and quite tacky.Location wise no complaints, caught the train from the airport to Central Station which is about a 10 - 15 minute journey then its just a short walk to the hotel. Capitol Square is right next to the theatre of the same name with a small shopping centre, Starbucks and Irish pub in the same block. Directly next to China Town some of which isn't that picturesque, but Darling Harbour which is brilliant is only a 15 minute walk away.Circular Quay is easy to reach either by taking the train, or a ferry from Darling Harbour which is certainly the most fun way or a good walk down George Street.Never had breakfast in the hotel instead whent along to Darling Harbour and had great meals sitting in the sunshine in one of the numerous outdoor cafes.Next time in Sydney probably will stay in Darling Harbour.

<Content>noisy I requested a quiet room when booking. I was given a room where you could distinctly hear people in the adjacent rooms coughing or talking, which make me wake up at nightime. The room was tiny, but this would have been fine for the price I paid, if a better sound insulation had been provided. This is not what you expect from a hotel of this category. No information at all was provided about telephone and internet rates in the room. I came back one night and found the entrance shut with a sign saying reception is temporarily closed, and I had to wait outside for a while before being allowed to get into my room.

<Content>Compact Stayed here for three nights when passing through Sydney on business, and a tight-ish budget. Got a good price through the Visitors' Centre.Most things about this hotel were just ok. The room I had could be described as 'compact' but no worse than in most major cities; room was clean. Bathroom pretty small (especially the bath - why bother? A shower would do in the space available). Breakfast adequate.I was on the second floor and was alarmed at the noise coming up from the restaurants next door when I exited the lift. I suspect the walls are pretty thin between rooms too, although luckily I didn't have noisy neighbours and the restaurant noise didn't actually stop me sleeping. I recommend the @Bangkok restaurant next door, incidentally - I think I was probably the only non-Thai person there, which is a pretty good indication of its quality.Two things annoyed me a lot. Firstly, the high internet charges. 50c a minute and I think your usage was capped at an hour in every 24 hours, though I didn't carry on using it too long at that price! There's also Secondly, the booklet in the room recommends guests make use of the safety deposit boxes at reception - well, they're tiny, far too small to get any valuable objects into unless they're paper and can be folded.

<Content>Good for those on a budget After reading some of the reviews for this hotel I was a little put off, however, staying in a standard twin, we booked this fairly last minute and for somewhere that was fairly close (approx 15 mins walking distance) to Darling Harbour and approx 20 mins monorail and walk to the Quay, the hotel was a decent price. It is basically in Chinatown, very close to Paddy's market and I would recommend using the monorail (get a day pass) to get around Sydney because the Paddy's market station is close and Sydney trains are pretty expensive. The rooms although quite small were adequate, sheets were clean, although the bed covers really probably need to be replaced. Staff were friendly and I would recommend this hotel for those wanting somewhere to stay close to the city on a budget.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Booked this hotel as we were off to Sydney to see Billy Elliot. The theatre is right next door, fantastic location! Very busy check in but staff delightful and helpful. There were seven of us and as we had arrived early only one room was ready, the other rooms were ready within 30 minute's of us arriving, so just great. Rooms are small~ish but adequate, very clean. We had three beds in our room and three chairs, bedside tables and lamps and bathroom while small was cetainly big enough, as previously suggested, to do what you need to do in a bathroom. A cupboard to hang clothes in and an ironing board! Small fridge and tea and coffee facilities. Oh and a TV. What amazed me was that we had a room facing Paddy's Market and thought that the traffic may have kept us awake at night! Hardly heard it at all! For us this hotel was very quiet. Breakfast was very good for the price and service of the young man who was clearing our table contantly was wonderful, l'm sorry l did not get his name, but he was terrific. Location of this hotel is wonderful, as mentioned a one minute walk if that to capitol Theatre, 10 minutes to Darling Harbour, across the road to Paddy's Market, 5 minutes to China Town, and a short bus ride to Circular Quay. Some very handy palces to eat close by. Yes, l would stay again.

<Content>Good Location This hotel was the first stay in Australia on my honeymoon. When we checked in it was rather frustrating that we had to go down to the basement, then go up a dirty elevator to get to our room. However, main elevator was fixed within a few hours of our stay. Staff was friendly for the most part, however, at times front desk could have used another person working as it did get really busy. Asked if they had any special deals for honeymoon couple and the lady at the desk said she could not help us to talk to management. It would have been nice if she could have took it upon herself to ask management.Room was nice for the most part. However, did get a little noisy at night. Our Queen sized bed was also two single beds pushed together. Hotel did have internet in 2nd floor lobby which was nice being from Canada and all. The location was great as all the other reviews have said. I think location is by far the best part about the trip as we were out of the room more then in it.The only real bad thing I have to say about this hotel is that we were told if we used a phone card it would only cost $.50 a cal at the most and we made about ten shorter calls and had $40.00 worth of charges.I would stay there again for the price!!

The room was very small with 2 single bedsbathroom, room for one person only at a time, window faced on to a alley ,dark room very tired hotel expected more from the Rydges Group.

<Content>Great Time I will admit that I was hesitant to stay at the Capitol Square Hotel after reading some of the negative reviews, however being on a tight budget (being near Christmas time) this was the hotel that offered the best rate in such a great location.I had a pleasant check-in and out experience. The staff were quite busy on both occasions, but they were very welcoming and polite to me and my partner. The manager on Duty, Jason I believe his name was, explained all the services in detail and answered all of my questions. He was also very helpful in letting me know what was around the hotel and what places of interest we could go.Location was a 5 minute walk to Central Station, China Town, Paddy's Markets, The QVB and other shopping centres, Cinemas and if you add another 5 minutes to the walk you're in beautiful Darling Harbour.The room was great considering what I paid. The room, bed, linen and bathroom were clean and comfortable. I had a pretty good view of George St and there was very little noise from the city. The room included a mini fridge, seats, cupboard (with extra pillows, blankets, iron and board, kettle, mugs tea and coffee), table, TV, clock radio, internet connection and air conditioning.The bathroom was substancial including a bath/shower, toilet, sink and all the towels, gel and shampoo/conditioner I needed. It was small, but not cramped and I had more than enough room to do what is done in a bathroom.Overall I am very pleased with my stay and the service provided from the Capitol Square Hotel.

<Content>Great location, pity about everything else I have stayed in many different Sydney hotels and this time around I searched for a well located hotel within Sydney for a reasonable rate for a one night stay just before Christmas. With a rate of $99 for a Sunday night stay in Sydney, Capitol Square Hotel appeared to fit the bill for this, so I was happy to book through the Rydges.com website.Upon my arrival at the hotel late on the Sunday evening, the reception was attended by two staff members, one of whom was on the phone, the other simply looked up at me blankly and said check in with what name? I mean come on, it takes only a few seconds more to actually say hello and actually get to know your guest, so I was rightly annoyed at this lack of courtesy. The same staff member then thrust a registration card at me and simply said can i have your credit card so I can take an imprint. Why bother employing staff when they do not actually bother to get to know their guests?I was allocated a room on the 5th floor of the hotel, and told by the staff member that this was the good floor to be on, well if this was the good floor I would really hate to see the other ones! The room had splotchy marks all over the carpets, dented old furniture and to make things even worse the bathroom was literally the size of a closet and did not have any towels at all! So I had to call back downstairs to reception to ask for some towels to be sent up to my room. I called twice and on both occasions the number simply rang out, on the third attempt my request was finally answered by a staff member who treated my call with contempt and merely stated that they would bring them up when they got a moment, I mean I am a paying guest, surely my concerns are a priority.Checking out early on Monday morning was certainly very fast, I arrived at the reception desk and said that I was checking out, the staff member merely said back to me what room and then proceeded to check me out without even a moments pause. My request to speak to someone about my stay merely yielded a response of the manager will not be here until 9am and I can't help you, I have stayed at many different hotels in Sydney and elsewhere, and this is the first time that I have actually been told that my opinion is worthless.This hotel has a great location at the heart of the entertainment district with Darling Harbour nearby. However the service here is simply appalling and definately not up to the standards of a Rydges property. Throughout my stay I gained the impression that I was simply not important enough to be listened to, and that the staff simply do not care as long as you pay up and get out in time. Next time I am in Sydney and paying for my own accommodation I will definately be staying at Ibis World Square or Metro on Pitt, who I am sure will actually appreciate and enjoy having me as a guest.

<Content>Unprofessional and disorganised! My friend and I were only in Sydney for one night to go to a concert, so we were happy to stay in a budget hotel in a busy area. The place wasn鈥檛 too noisy, and the location is fantastic, a short 5 minute walk to central station and heaps of shops, restaurants etc. The bathroom and room were clean, apart from the doona cover which had urine stains and the carpet which had a large orange stain (not that the carpet matters). However, it was the poor service we received when we arrived that turned us off.I was called the day before the booking and informed that there was an error with wotif.com; the website kept taking bookings even though they were full, so they were now overbooked. The lady was very nice, and explained that they鈥檇 arranged accommodation for us across the road at the Metro, which has the same star-rating and amenities and would be the same price. For the inconvenience, Capitol would throw in a complimentary breakfast, too. We arrived at the Metro and waited in line a while, and when we got to the desk the staff couldn鈥檛 find our booking. About ten minutes was spent waiting in line and then waiting for the staff to go through the system to find us, checking with other staff, etc. Then we were told they needed to call the Capitol, because they couldn鈥檛 find our booking. I wasn鈥檛 too happy about all the waiting as we had a tight turnaround time before we had to leave for our concert, and we were hoping to get a nanna nap in before we left. We waited another ten minutes while the Metro staff tried for a while to get through to the Captitol (either the phone was busy or no-one was answering) but we were finally told that the Capitol DID have a room for us. Now that鈥檚 inconvenience: waiting in line when you鈥檙e tired, hungry and thirsty for no reason whatsoever.We got to Capitol and waited in line some more. We overheard the clerk say to the customers in front of us as they left for their room, that they were in the 鈥済ood鈥?side of the hotel, meaning away from the street and the roadworks. How unprofessional to say that at all -admitting that there鈥檚 a good and bad side to a hotel when you pay the same rate- and worse, in front of other customers!?We were given our room key and I asked if breakfast was still included; in my opinion we鈥檇 been stuffed around more waiting across the road unnecessarily than we would have been if we鈥檇 actually checked in to the Metro. The clerk checked our paperwork and said that our booking didn鈥檛 include it. I explained that we鈥檇 been told we were now getting complimentary breakfast, to which the manager told the clerk right in front of us (we weren鈥檛 important enough to be acknowledged) that no, our booking didn鈥檛 come with breakfast, and we weren鈥檛 supposed to go to the Metro at all (as if it was our fault we went there).We were told to go to the Metro by Capitol, but they wouldn鈥檛 admit their mistake nor make good on their conciliation for the hassle. Annoyed, I pointed out that they鈥檇 wasted our time, about half an hour (meaning no nap). Indirectly, the clerk then accused us of lying, by checking his watch and saying it鈥檇 only been ten minutes since he received the phone call from the Metro. Again, they didn鈥檛 seem to grasp the fact that it was their fault we were waiting 20 minutes at the Metro, not the Metros or ours. The Capitol鈥檚 handling of the issue made us feel completely undervalued; a free breakfast is nothing compared to the loss of repeat business from people who stay in Sydney CBD regularly. So there you have it: location good; amenities okay; service appalling.

<Content>Convenient Don't agree w/ other reviewer. In fact, our floor was being painted during our stay (rooms  halls). Only heard street noise if window was left open. As it's the end of autumn, beginning of winter didn't even try the A/C. Never tried the dining room as I agree $10 is a bit much for breakfast when all I need is a piece of fruit or a muffin. Central Station was about as far as Darling Harbour, a 10-15 minute walk. We even walked up George St. to Queen Elizabeth Mall so it's really conveniently located. 2 blocks from Paddy's Market, banks everywhere,  a Starbucks right next door. Many Asian restaurants in the area as you're in Chinatown. Found a laundrymat between the hotel  Central Stn. I'd say better than the YHA 2 blocks away.

<Content>Hostel type accomodation My parents and I stayed in the family room for 4 nights in June 07. Upon arrival we were asked to deposit $50 for 10 days which we weren't aware of (we booked throu Expedia.com.au and no such info was available). The room was small which we didnt mind. The floor boards throughout the room made noise everytime you walked. The bed cover was faded ad had many stains and a few holes. The beds are certainly not comfortable. One major issue we had was the Air Conditioning unit in the room was blowing cold air in the middle of the night. Breakfast is quite simple and not worth $10. One thing that we were quite annoyed about was the fact that the hotel is dirty by anyone's standard. The towels are well used and in need of replacement.In my opinion the hotel is not a 3 star hotel. The hotel has vending machines for alcohol, bevereges,snacks, toothbrushes, etc... so you cannot really say that this is a hotel, it had a hostel feel to it. I was aware that the hotel went through a soft refurbishing but I think soft refurbishing meant that they changed the carpet only. Location is not very good, it takes over 10 mins to walk to central station or the Town Hall station. The hotel is not too far to Darling Harbour which seems to be the only positive side of the hotel.Being on a main street, it is very noisy at nights, there is a bar/pub downstairs which adds to the street noise! There are also restaurants on the other side of the hotel and you can definitely hear the noise when you are n the hallways.I suggest to shop around for a hotel in sydney, this hotel is too expensive for $95-$115 a night for 2, mainly because it is a run down hotel, uncomfortable and lacks the wow factor. Hotels around the Central Station are cheaper and in better condition, although it feels that they are not really in town but are only seconds from the central station which means that for a day ticket you can go pretty much every where in town faster and with less walking.

<Content>Decent hotel within easy reach of Darling Harbour Good hotel for a base within walking distance of Chinatown and Darling Harbour. Just off a busy road but no real problem with noise and within easy reach of bus routes to the Opera House, shops and Bondi. The room (Queen) was not exactly spacious but had a balcony and aircon; the bathroom was really very tiny but serviceable. Buffet style breakfast was more than adequate, and the guy on the Reception Desk was very helpful. Quite OK for a couple of nights stay.

<Content>Perfectly fine Paid 45 GBP per night, stayed for 4 nights. Hotel was perfectly fine, bed was soft and comfortable, didn't get any noise problems. Room and bathroom were clean - not at all kennel-sized. Had room for two large suitcases. Reception staff were really friendly and helpful - told us how to get to places and gave us internet sites for long term accomodation. Had buffet breakfast for $10 each, was very nice. Location is excellent - walking distance to chinatown, Darling Harbour, central station and CBD. I don't remember an Irish pub being downstairs but it's a large hotel so it may depend where your room is. All in all a perfectly fine stay - good value, great location. Obviously not the Ritz though!

<Content>DREADFUL We stayed at this hotel based on another website's reviews. Whilst it is close to Chinatown and next door to the Captitol Theatre, it has small (dog kennel sized) rooms, hard beds (I mean worn out not firm), cleaning standard is less than that of a backpackers. We stayed in Backpackers which have been better. I have stayed in may hotels in Sydney and have had better experiences at a cheaper price. This hotel should be more around the $60 per night mark.Oh, if you like noise and thin walls, this is the place for you with an Irish pub right underneath going on Friday to the wee hours of the morning. Sydney does love to show off the sirens the Government has paid for on the Police and Fire vehicles and these pass right up George street every hour at least. The Rydges in Camperdown, an old hotel near the Hospital, is MUCH better.

<Content>Ok at the best We booked accomodation at the new Meriton apartments in sydney for the week but they could not accomodate us for the first night of our trip so we stayed at the capitol square whilst awaiting our other accomodation. We paid $120 for the night which was quite cheap and the room was ok. It was small but quite clean and had a tiny balcony that you could stand on to smoke. The bed was quite comfortable and checkin and checkout was fast and easy and the staff even offered to keep our baggage there the next morning until we could check in at our other apartment. The cleaning staff were even friendlier than the reception staff greeting you with a 'hello ..how are you' every time you bumped into them in the hallways, a nice gesture i thought. All in all it did the job and for the price you cant complain. I wouldnt recommend lond stays in the hotel though as the room would be too small and the area (chinatown) isnt as nice as the city or the harbour, it was quite convient though for its central location.

<Content>You get what you paid for! I booked this stay through the Rydges website, as I have stayed with Rydges around the country before I thought it would be of the same standard. The receptionist on duty when checking in was tired, the room and bathroom could have done with a really good clean. The only good thing was that the bed was clean and linen was fresh. No laundry facility within the hotel was also an inconvenience to a business traveller. Defenitly not a hotel for young families.

<Content>Good Budget Hotel I had an extended stay at this hotel, as I was in Sydney for 6 days of business and several more for pleasure. I stayed at this hotel as a conference-recommended hotel and it seems like a fine choice for a budget traveler. In response to one of the previous reviews, yes the TV seems to be reception-only (no cable or sat TV) but there were a number of stations and as a US-expat living in Asia I enjoyed watching Letterman and USA morning shows at the wee hours of the morning 鈥?so the reception and channels were fine enough. The location is pretty good 鈥?you can easily walk to places like Darling Harbour and Hyde Park (both about 15 mins walk away). There were many and frequent buses right out at the street that take you directly down to Circular Quay (5 min bus ride). There are a ton of restaurants in the area 鈥?especially if you crave Asian food (there are plenty of non-Asian choices also). There is a major grocery store 2 blocks away 鈥?and keeping yourself well-stocked was no problem and very convenient. I was not a fan of the breakfast 鈥?the choice is somewhat limited. Although the setting is bright and cool, I only ate breakfast there as it was a convenience on working days. The young staff was very friendly and helpful 鈥?and after so many days I had a lot of contact with them. One downside was that some guests seemed to attempt smoking in their rooms (which is not allowed) and set off the fire alarm - - this happen at least twice and having to evacuate is not a pleasant experience. Overall, it was a pleasant stay. While initially I was not sure I could stay for so long in a small room, it grew on me and I quickly grew to like it.

<Content>Good location but not sure I'd stay there again Booked this hotel on line and asked for a non smoking room. Upon entering the room it was evident that it was a smoking room - there was an ashtray sitting on the TV ! My husband went down to reception and complained about the smell - we were quickly moved to a larger non smoking room. Bathrooms are very small and there was no water pressure in the shower. Breakfast was okay..The reception area is very small and looks like it needs a revamp and not very impressive and if there are lots of people checking in it gets very cramped. I have stayed at better hotels nearby for the same price.

<Content>perfect location, slightly above average hotel I booked Capitol Square due to it's price and location. I wanted a basic but clean hotel right in the city. That is exactly what I got - not much more.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The lady at reception gave me great ideas on where to site-see, and how to get around. The room was small, but nicely decorated. Didn't try the food, but I checked out the breakfast buffet and it looked good.The only negative is the cleaning - my room appeared to be cleaned thoroughly when I arrived, but I went to have a bath and noticed long dark hairs in the tub!! Yuck.However, in spite of the cleaning misfortune, I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a hotel with no frills, inexpensive, and centrally located.

<Content>Location  Stayed here two nights after booking on the Rydges.com website. I found rydges to have a better rate than last minute booking sites (eg ---- or ----).The hotel room was small but had all the necessary inclusions. A short stroll up George St to the city centre for shopping and only  10 mins walk to Darling Harbour / Cockle Bay Wharf for a plethora of restaurant choices. Yes this hotel is in Chinatown but this adds to the atmosphere. Downstairs from the hotel is a busy Starbucks. Car parking expensive at $22 per day. Overall I recommend the hotel. It is a worthy 3 star establishment.

<Content>Good Location - furniture a bit tired Stayed here for 4 nights in mid February and one night in March (liked it enought to return!). Hotel well located close to Chinatown (great food)and the pleasant pedestrianised walkways to Darling Harbour (fantastic evening venue). Short walk to City Monorail and around 20 minutes along Pitt Street (the main shopping street)to Circle Quays Harbour and Opera House. Supermarket/ travel companies and internet cafes all around. As already reported reception is tiny but there was a locked room to store lugage. Staff helpful and friendly. Rooms compact with furniture looking a bit tired but nonetheless clean. I found the hotel to be suprisingly quiet expecially considering its location close to George Street/Pitt Street and I am a very light sleeper. An interesting Restaurant with a good breakfast choice. Overall I reckon this hotel was very good value for money and would certainly use again.

<Content>Avoid this Terrible Hotel !!! Me and a friend had the misfortune of staying at this hotel. The location is rubbish - there is nothing of interest nearby. There is only ONE lift for the entire hotel to use which is utterly ridiculous. The receptionist is extremely rude - he doesn't even bother to say hello when you greet him. When you walk into the hotel the first thing you see is tons of luggage lying around as there is no storage room. Anyone can walk off with somebody else's suitcase. The rooms was VERY small - the floorboards creak and the reception on the TV was appalling - unwatchable. The beds are uncomfortable. The hotel was FREEZING - we had to wrap up before going to have breakfast in the mornings.If you want to check in early or check out late - FORGET IT - They charge you astronomical rates!! Complete rip-off. The walls are thin and you hear the people staying in the room next door. Even the breakfast was mediocre.This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. I would not stay there again if they paid me. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.
