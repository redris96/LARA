<Content>Gorgeous hotel We stayed here for 3 nights for our honeymoon after finding it on TripAdvisor. The hotel definently lives up to its reviews.The rooms are beautifully decorated, the bathrooms are well equipped and the staff are very friendly and efficient.A breakfast was served in the morning of rolls, croissants, fruit, etc and was more than enough to fill you up till lunch time.The location of the hotel was ideal - a 10 minute stroll to St Marks square but in a quiet area away from the more touristy areas. There are a couple of restaurants and bars around the corner that served delicious food. The water taxi stop was also just outside and handy for travelling to/from the airport.We are already planning our next trip to Venice and will definently stay at the Al Ponte Mocenigo.

<Content>Nice place tucked away in a Venetian alley Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo has a lot of positives and not much to complain about. It is tucked away in a small alley right off the Grand Canal and not too far from the train station. Our rooms were in the annex building next door which I have no complaints about. The rooms were a little small but the decor and bathrooms were very nice and the size was typical for a European city. The location was good. It was outside of the tourist track and so the surrounding neighborhoods were quiet and you could see something like how Venice might have been before it became a tourist trap. However, the attractions were not a bad walk, although good luck finding anything in Venice without getting lost. I suppose that is part of the fun, wandering the streets and coming into an ancient square or hidden little street where most tourists never see.Breakfast was served every morning and was pretty minimal but good. Recommended for quality and price.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised To say we were pleasantly surprised is a understatement. We spent days in January researching hotels in anticipation of our trip to Italy and we were aware that hotels in Europe are small and the facilities leave a lot to be desired, people may not be that friendly, etc, etc......but I have to say the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is an exception! It is located near a Vaparetto Stop and everything is a 10-15 minute walk if you don't want to take the Water Taxi (St Mark's Square, train station, Jewish Ghetto, etc)Our first room was very small, tucked in behind the check-in desk and was next to one of the doors leading into the hotel, but it was really quiet and cozy - I didn't mind the small space at all, it was actually romantic! We spend our last night in the largest room in the hotel which was also a nice treat, the king bed looked dwarfed compared to the size of the room and the bathroom even had a tub!Out of all the hotels we stayed at in Italy, this hotel had one of the best breakfasts included. Lots of variety, specialty coffees made to order and good yogurt.Walter is very helpful and a fantastic source of information. Our plane landed in Venice in the AM and our room wasn't ready. We arrived at the hotel in the midst of check out time and breakfast had ended. Walter told us to have a seat and relax while he finished with the other customers and had coffee brought over. He then gave us info about the area, pointed out some great restaurants and a small walking tour that we could go on while our room was being cleaned.Walter gave us great advice and restaurant recommendations daily and always checked in with all the guest to see how their vacations were going. My parents are going to Italy next year and I have recommended this hotel. I know we will stay here again next time we are in Italy. This hotel isn't high end so if you are expecting room service, not for you, but I thought it was great value for the price and exceeded the expectations I had about hotels in Europe!

<Content>Perfect city hotel, exceptional value. I took my girlfriend to Venice for 2 nights mid December for her 30th birthday gift.EVERYTHING about the hotel is great. The location, 1 minute walk from the San Stae Vaporetto stop. good when you are trailling a suitcase over cobbles. It is in the north east part of the island which is less busy, there are some excellent value restaurants and wine bars a short walk from the hotel. Getting down to St Marks is 15minute walk. As long as you are on the island it doesnt really matter where you are, you walk everywhere. We had the green suite on the top floor of the annex with a little balcony. We paid 94 Euros a night, booked direct through the hotel. The room quality was exceptional for this price, a good 4* anywhere in the world. Dont let that 2* rating on their website put you off. Breakfast great, continental style, great service.10/10, book it now!

<Content>Wow! #1 WOW! We stayed at the Red-Room (ex kitchen), and it was HUGE!!!, it felt like a suite or something. Carlito was great and even offered us breakfast and fruits to pack with us on our last day leaving at 6am. I felt like i was at home years ago with my Mom stuffing food in my backpack heading for school.The guest computer was a lifesaver checking our tickets and misc items prior to our departure. Travel books galore littered thier library as well with new current editions. If you are planning a trip to Venice, don't even bother looking anywhere else.

<Content>Just perfect! This was our first time staying in Venice, we had only been for day trips before, and selected the hotel based on the reviews on Tripadviser. We were thrilled with our choice and so glad we didn't go for a hotel nearer St Marks. It is so convienient for exploring all of Venice and we feel you really do get a different feel to the city then if you had booked a more touristy hotel. The rooms are beautiful and large, the annexe is lovely and we would actually choose to stay there next time we visit. The staff are charming , friendly and cannot be more helpfull.All in all a gem of a hotel , a real find, we will never stay anywhere else , just loved it!!

<Content>Magnifico Moncenigo! You'll know the score about Al Ponte Moncenigo from the other TA reviews - the customer service is of the highest order (from all the staff), the hotel feels intimate and cozy and the rooms are tasteful decorated. It's ideally located being conveniently located for all the major sights (literally 1 minute walk from the San Stae vaporetto stop, 10 mins from the Rialto and 20 from St Marks) but at the same time in an area that's quiet and not too touristy. It's thoroughly deserving of the TA awards that it's won.Top tips Restaurants - Al Nono Rissorto (nr San Cassano) - Very popular with Venetians which tells its own story. Decent service and really excellent food, the higlights of which where the salmon gnochi and the spaghetti with mussels and clams. Very reasonably priced for the quality of the food that you get. If you want a decent cheap Pizzeria try Ae Oche About 5 mins walk from the hotel is Campo San Giacomo dell'Orio where there is the Co-op supermarket and an excellent little pastry shop called Majer both of which are useful should you not want to eat out.If you are going to the Doge's palace - you absolutely must book the Secret Itinery tour which takes you to hidden parts of the Palace that you wouldn't have access to otherwise including Cazanova's cell

<Content>Great Hotel!!! Our family recently stayed at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo. The rooms are big, exceptionally clean, and quite luxurious. When you're in your room, you would feel like you are staying in a 4 or 5 star hotel. The staff is remarkable. Sandro, Walter, Donatello and Carlito are always helpful and pleasant. The ladies serving breakfast, Grace and Milette (sp?), always provided excellent service. The location couldn't be better. It is a few meters away from the San Stae Vaporetto stop. It is also a few minutes walk to Rialto. I would rate this hotel higher if not for some billing problems that we encountered. At check-out, we were being charged a higher rate than the rate originally quoted to us. Luckily, we had a copy of the e-mail that confirmed the rate. It was a bit uncomfortable asking them to honor the rate that we were quoted, but they honored it anyway. Apparently, their computer system crashed and lost some of their e-mails that provided this information. Had we not brought copies of the e-mail, we would have paid a higher rate. Despite this problem, I would not hesitate staying at this property again. You can feel that the people here genuinely care about their guests and they understand the true meaning of customer service. They will do everything that they can to make their guests happy, thus, making it a highly rated hotel on tripadvisor.

<Content>Would recommend this hotel to anyone Would recommend this hotel to anyone. We were a party of 9 women from London on a 3 day trip to Venice. The hotel was great value, had charming staff, was very well positioned (we arrived by water taxi, and a landing plank was put out for us due to very high water levels), and with very Italian atmosphere.Rooms very well appointed and better than many four star hotels in some cases. Room 5 has a lovely balcony overlooking the canal, but all the rooms we had were quite luxurious. The Proprietors were very helpful and spoke perfect English, putting us all to shame.Will never stay anywhere else when in Venice!!!

The rooms are beautifully appointed, clean and comfortable. Breakfast is generous and delicious. Everyone who works there is helpful and pleasant. Walter, one of the owners I think, could not be more helpful. He's full of good information re local restaurants, itineraries, bus times etc etc- and generous with his time.One of my top two hotels ever.I'll be recommending Hotel Mocenigo to everyone.

<Content>Venice the First Time ... But Not the Last! Our 2-day visit was made more enjoyable by staying at this pretty hotel tucked away in a quiet neghbourhood but with the S. Stae vaporetto stop less than a minute's walk away (15 minute ride to S. Marco). Or, just a 10 minute walk through pretty lanes leads to Rialto and S. Marco. All the staff were friendly and helpful and most spoke excellent Engish. Good sized, well-appointed rooms and bathrooms were spotlessly clean (as we were a party of 9 we all had a good look around each others' rooms! ) Very well priced for such a high standard of accommodation. Staying at the Al Ponte Mocenigo enhanced my first ever visit to Venice and when I return I shall book in again!

<Content>Far From the Madding Crowd This hotel is wonderfully tucked away in a quiet location. If you want peace you'll find it here.Saying that, you are still very close to the vaporetto stop, 1 minute I'd say, and only a 15 or 20 minute walk to the tourist hub of St Mark's Square. The host that we saw most of, Walter, couldn't have done more to make us feel at home. Nothing was too much trouble. He is a genuinely nice man and his English is excellent. We stayed in room 6. It was gorgeous. I've never seen ceilings so high in a bedroom! It was also very clean. There was adequate bedding and a modern heating system. There was a good selection of channels on the TV. The bathroom was also very modern and exceptionally clean. Lovely soft towels and a very effective shower. There was a bath too. We booked for bed and breakfast and this is served between 8 and 10. It is simple fare but there is a good choice of hot and cold drinks, cereals, cakes, fresh fruit and lovely little warm rolls and fresh croissants. There was enough food available to nicely set us up for the serious amount of walking we did. The serving staff were very friendly and made efforts to speak English where necessary. We only went to Venice for a couple of days but when we return we will definitely stay here again. It was easy on the wallet too which is a bonus in Venice, but that's another story!!Thank you Walter.

<Content>Perfect. I booked five rooms at Hotel Al ponte Mocenigo for myself and friends for Birthday celebrations. This might have been awkward for a small hotel but every aspect was covered perfectly and considering everyone was arriving and departing at different times, restuarants had to be booked and different needs had to be met. nothing was too much trouble. I loved everything about this Hotel, I agree wholeheartedly with all the positive coments before mine. A true gem.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful! After reading many reviews, especially those on Tripadvisor, we booked a 3 night stay at Al Ponte Mocenigo directly with the hotel for late October 2008. We were a mother (60s) and son (40s) on a two week tour through Europe, and this was by far our favorite hotel. Our room on the second floor was huge, with two twin beds. As I have back problems, I very much appreciated the firm mattress. The bathroom was huge and very nice as well. I appreciated the free Internet, as every other hotel we stayed in required us to pay for the service. The morning breakfast was lovely. The staff was marvelously attentive and made you feel like you were staying with friends. Location was great (so close to a vaporetto stop), and also within easy walking distance from Rialto Bridge. We fell in love with Venice, and Al Ponte Mocenigo will definitely be our hotel when we next return.

The room was very large and clean as well as the bathroom which had a bathtub. We stayed in the room on the first floor which opened out onto the courtyard. Was worried if we would have alot of noise at first but it was never a problem. The staff was very nice and helpful for any questions that we had. For the price and location and quality of the room this is the best find. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Nice place We were here for 3 nights in October and enjoyed it very much. As many have said, the beds were quite hard for us, but they seem typical of Italy.The staff is friendly and helpful.The breakfast was tasty. Loved the blood orange juice and the plums.Nice location, if you like to walk. If you don't like to walk, don't visit Venice. We wandered towards the train staion and found a lovely square filled with locals. There is a nice COOP grocery store there as well. Only .35E for a small bottle of water!

<Content>Excellent hotel and location We, family with two teenage boys, stayed here for three nights at end Oct/early Nov. We had one room in the Annex with double and two single beds. Room was well decorated and furnished. Very clean and very adequate bathroom etc. Very friendly and helpful staff, and good breakfast in small courtyard to start off the day.Great location - quiet area but easy to walk or take the water bus/vaporetto to other parts of the City. We booked on basis of Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed.Venice is great for a week-end, even with a damp and cool day in Murano followed by two glorious days (high teens) around Venice itself. Key tips - we took a 72 hour vaporetto pass buying it at the airport (and one hour later we were in our hotel) - gives alot of flexibility as we used it more than I imagined. Make sure you take a wander down the backstreets to appreciate the real soul of Venice. And on Sunday we nipped across to Jewish quarter where all the shops were open.

<Content>Fantastic bathroom We stayed here for 2 nights in late October. We had room 10 which is huge and very green! Our only complaint is that it was a little too dark with just the bedside lights on and too bright with the chandelier on (though glad we could switch off all the lights without getting out of bed). The room would have been perfect with one or 2 lamps and maybe a rug on the cold floor (perhaps this isn't a Venetian thing?). Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was fantastic (had spa bath - bliss after a days sightseeing). We specifically asked for a quiet room (as light sleepers) and indeed this room was very quiet. Not sure if the rooms opening off the lobby/breakfast area would be so quiet, so mention this if this is important to you too. The hotel is about 2 minutes walk to the Ca Pessaro modern art gallery which is well worth a visit (especially if you have overdosed on 16th century art). We have visited Venice several times so glad to be away from St Marks Square hustle and bustle. This hotel was much cheaper than where we have stayed before but standard just as high (if not higher) and the staff are very helpful. Would definitely recommend. I now feel guilty I mentioned about the lights (they would probably have rushed in with lamps if I had said something while we were there!)

Yes, the beds are a little hard, but the rooms are beautiful, clean, spacious and the staff excellent! We stayed for three nights and had a fabulous time. Great neighborhood - away from the crowds but easy walking to Rialto and San Marco. We did get a little lost but it was fun and beautiful. Venice is quite magical - we went in November. Yes, it rained and there was fog, but that added to the experience.I would recommend Al Ponte and stay there again!

<Content>A wonderful beginning to our trip! This was the perfect start to our 3 week vacation in Italy. We were surprised how much we liked Venice ( especially compared to Rome) We booked based on prior trip advisor reviews though it was not easy to get a reservation! I was booked elsewhere and kept checking the hotel website and switched as soon as I nabbed a room. We loved the location - quiet, but not too far to walk to the major sights. We also loved the area restaurants that the hotel recommended especially Il refolo and La Zucca. We would not hesitate to recommend this to our friends and would stay here if ( when, hopefully)we return to Venice!

<Content>Even better than expected Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo was even better than we had expected even after all of the glowing reviews we had read. We stayed in the annex which is just around the corner from the main hotel and our room was spectacularly fitted out and had a separate sitting room (with its own LCD TV) which made it quite spacious. The hotel location is very close to the San Stae vaparetto stop and is not a long walk to the Rialto Bridge. Breakfasts were very good and a free internet PC was a bonus. However, it was the friendly and helpful attitude of the owners and staff that made the extra difference. Gluten-free bread was provided on our request and they made an effort every day to get something nice when their usual supply was not available. However, the help provided to recover my misplaced sunglasses and the support provided when I had a painful back complaint for a day were things that showed how much Walter and Sandro really care about their guests.

<Content>A Venice gem After 8 visits to Venice and having thoroughly enjoyed 6 different hotels (mostly 3 and 4 star), we came upon this wonderful hotel which was far and away the best we have stayed in. The rooms and bathrooms were spacious and spotlessly clean, beautifully and authentically decorated, the staff incredibly kind, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful; the area ,Santa Croce, the real Venice, quiet and off the main tourist track yet centrally located and only a short walk to San Stae vaparetto stop. There are many non-touristy, authentic good-value restaurant s nearby, while breakfast in the beautiful courtyard was a highlight each morning. Overall a 5 star  hotel in every respect with only an official 2 star rating and price!A real gem!

<Content>No Gaurentee Of A Room We booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews which it had received.We were supposed to have stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from 04 October to 08 October as part of our honeymoon. We booked the hotel on 06 January, some 9 months prior to our arrival.On arrival at the hotel we were told that they did not have our booking and therefore no room. This was despite us having received not 1 but 2 confirmation e-mails from the hotel.They had a booking in the same name as ours in their reservations book for 3 nights starting from the next night, but we were told that this was just a coincidence!!!The explanation that we were given for them not having our booking was that the replies were automatic and that there must have been a problem with the server. This was very strange as one of our confirmation e-mails was hand typed with specific information for ourselves!This was all happening at reception with 2 Trip Advisor Awards proudly displayed behind the receptionist.They did arrange another hotel for us, but it was not of the same standard and in a very busy area, which was not what we wished for on our honeymoon.I don't know if this hotel has become too popular and they cannot cope with demand, whether they are overbooking intentially, or if they are cancelling bookings which have been made at lower room rates. All I know is that they did not honour our booking.Please be very careful when booking this hotel as having a confirmation (or even 2) is no gaurentee that there will actually be a room available for you when you arrive.Especially if you are on honeymoon!

<Content>Back again , still perfect in every way We have stayed in the Al Ponte Mocenigo , before and knew it was the only hotel we would ever go back to in Venice.Room 2 is not as bad as one of the reviewers states, it is the smallest room and always the last to be booked out and the owners will always tell you this in advance.The rooms are beautifull and give you a real taste of authentic venice.The hotel is over it's own little private bridge and has a great courtyard, it has the perfect location for meandering through the streets, loads of great little Osteria's and bars nearby.We are already booked to go back again soon.

<Content>Lovely little hotel.... worth every cent Great little hotel. A bit tricky to find (down a tiny little laneway, with only a minature sign), but well worth the effort, and actually quite close to one of the ferry stops. The Superior room was great - decorated in an old venetian style. I didn't see the standard rooms so not sure how good they are. Hotel was very clean. Breakfast in the little courtyard was lovely. Staff are fantastic - I think this was the only hotel in Italy that gave us a whole lot of helpful advice, maps etc on our arrival. Internet is fast and free. Right on a canal. About 10 minutes to Rialto by foot but the walk is nice. We would return for sure! We also thought the price (we paid 150E per night for a superior room I think) was incredibly reasonable compared to other places we stayed in Italy.

<Content>Beautiful B This hotel is as quaint and magical as Venice itself. Great location. Wonderful staff. And rooms that are so spacious you forget you're in Italy. We thought the rooms were so precious/cute and had that Italian look to them. Walter greeted us warmly and we were disappointed we were only able to stay one night. Next time we return we are staying here without a second thought.

<Content>We could not have hoped for better.... Along with so many other reviewers, we booked this hotel because of the exceptional rating on Trip Advisor. Our expectations were high, and we were not disappointed.The hotel was small, friendly and extremely clean. A very easy walk from the Water Bus stop and perfectly located for our 4 day stay in Venice. The rooms were decorated in a beautiful Venetian style. We had room 32 on the second floor of the Annexe. The bedroom was large, with a small lounge off of it which had a table and 2 chairs and a day bed with a roll out bed underneath - allowing 4 to stay comfortably. The bathroom was lovely. We had a bath and shower attached. Both the bedroom and lounge had TVs and we had a fridge. The hairdryer, however, was not very powerful. We also had a tiny balcony off the lounge - just enough room to stand. We looked out to the street, just up from the Grand Canal. The location was very quiet, but you were not far from the canal, water bus, restaurants or sights.Breakfast was taken in the main hotel, only about a 50m walk around the outside of the hotel. We ate in the courtyard - though a little chilly, so dine with a jumper and scarf. Delicious couisants, cereals, rolls, jams, fruit, yoghurt, coffee, tea and juice - plenty of all.The staff were happy and very helpful. After an unfortunate incident with the canal my clothes were washed, dried and returned to my room within 6 hours. We ate at restaurants recommended and booked by the hotel, and they were all superb. I would thouroughly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Venice.

<Content>Perfect Except for Rock Hard Beds We absolutely love this hotel for the location and service, and for the neighborhood where it is located. I was concerned at first that it wasn't right near St. Mark's Square, but actually it is an easy walk or short ride on the vaporetto. We liked returning to our little quiet neighborhood after a day of touring and crowds. The only reason I would not stay here again though is the beds. It is like sleeping on the floor. I noticed a previous reviewer liked the firm beds, well these were more than firm. Venice was our first stop, and after flying in from the U.S. and dealing with jet lag the beds just did not help relieve our fatigue. I am writing this in hopes that maybe the hotel will read this, as again, we really love this place, and would like to return someday. We are in the hotel business, and we feltthe beds really needed replacing.

<Content>Again a fantastic hotel Stayed in mid September, as with all other reviews it was amazing. The room was very large and clean all the staff friendly. Walter and Sandro great hosts and went out of their way to be helpful. We asked directions to a friends hotel and after we left Walter rang the other hotel to say we were on our way which was wonderful because we would have never have found it if my friend hadn't been outside waiting for us. The only thing I would have liked is tea and coffee making facilities in the room.

<Content>Perfect start to a honeymoon What a way to start our honeymoon, this hotel is a little gem. Next to the San Stae vaporetto stop in a lovely quiet area just off the Grand Canal. We stayed in the annex in a palatial room with a small balcony and a bottle of sparkly stuff to welcome us. Alex and his partner in the business were more than helpful and friendly (especially since our airline left my luggage in Manchester for two days), and breakfast in the beautiful courtyard was something to look forward to every morning. There's access to a computer and the internet in the main hotel, but the highlights are definitely the friendliness of the staff, the comfort of the rooms and it's SO close to the bus stop that seeing all of Venice in 4 days was a sinch! Will definitely go back.

<Content>It is perfect This hotel is amazing! No need to write the same things you will find in the other reviews. I will just touch on the internet service which I found to be excellent. I am not a person that needs to be connected 24/7 but I needed to double check couple of flight reservations and any e-mails from my professors. Let me tell you that finding an Internet station in Venice is not that easy at all. So I was very pleasantly surprise to be able to use the lobby computer on the second floor for free. Great hotel, great service and perfect location!

<Content>Add My Name to the Legion of Fans You've read it all before in the numerous and well-deserved glowing reviews that precede mine, but it literally is too good to be true. I stayed at Al Ponte Mocenigo from 9/20/08 to 9/23/08 and this is truly a little gem. The location, a bit off of the beaten path, is ideal because it resides in an authentic neighborhood with fine, unfussy local restaurants and shops. The hotel is only about 100 feet from the San Stae stop on vaporetto #1 so the hotel is quite easy to reach and one has quick access to the rest of the city. The entire staff is genuinely friendly and welcoming and everyone I had contact with spoke fluent English.I stayed in Room #22 in the Annex and it was wonderful. The room was excellent size, especially for Venice, and had been recently renovated with quality furnishings and taste. The bathroom was superb with an ample-sized shower stall, beautiful marble walls, and modern fixtures. The bed and pillows were firm --- which I greatly prefer --- and provided a wonderful night's sleep. The neighborhood is also quiet in the late evening so that sleeping soundly is not a problem.Breakfast was fine with yogurt, fresh fruit, juices, cereals, etc., and someone who would serve a fresh jam-filled croissant and rolls, then take your request for coffee, capuccino, etc. Weather permitting, there is a nice outdoor courtyard off of the breakfast room as well. Simply put, this is a fine Venetian hotel that is a great value. I suppose one could spend three or four hundred Euro per day more to stay at Hotel Gritti or Bauer so that one can walk into a grand lobby, but why?? I hope to return soon to Venice for a longer stay and I will undoubtedly make a reservation again at Al Ponte Mocenigo.

<Content>Delightful hotel in delightful Venice My husband and I spent 5 days in Venice at the beginning of September and cannot praise the Al Ponte Mocenigo staff highly enough. Sandro and Walter were very friendly and helpful. We had a room in the annexe which was beautiful, spotlessly clean and security was excellent. The hotel is easily found on arriving at the San Stae stop. Walk straight ahead and look up at the wall. You will find a small brass plaque indicating you turn left down a very narrow alleyway to the entrance. Quite novel manoeuvring cases and yourself down towards the door! You would not believe a hotel was located here. We were extremely comfortable, being away from the busy tourist areas. Breakfast was served in the courtyard and we especially enjoyed the apricot croissants, which everyone raves about! It was helped greatly by Grace, our smiling waitress who was so attentive. We did a lot of the tourist attractions but found that it was just as much fun walking for miles, getting lost but finding that you are seldom far away from the Grand Canal. We spent many happy hours strolling around the San Stae area, coming across lovely restaurants on the way. On our way back to our hotel one evening we stumbled upon a large group of Italians dancing the tango to very seductive music! My husband and I thought it best to leave it to the experts and merely sat and enjoyed. The Venetians certainly have rhythm in their blood! It was a truly unexpected experience and one we will not forget. I have to say that our time in Venice was magical. There is no place like it. I had always wanted to visit and as this is only our second time away without kids, who no longer are of an age to go on holiday with their parents, it made it even more enjoyable. I also celebrated my 50th birthday in July so it was a wonderful way to finish off the never-ending celebrations. I would not hesitate to stay at this wonderful hotel should I return to Venice.

<Content>Excellent and worth the recoommendations on Tripadvisor Great hotel and well worth the praise heaped upon it from members of this site. Rooms are very nicely decorated, air conditioning is excellent, bathroom was finished to a very high standard and breakfasts were lovely. Location wise it is literally a 5 minute stroll to Rialto, and about 10 to St. Marco. Otherwise it is directly off the S. Stae Vaporetto stop. The restaurants recommended by Walter and Sandro are all good (and nicely priced also). We stayed for 3 nights and loved our time there. We both said we would return. This is an extremely friendly hotel, with courteous staff who are pleased to help with any question you might have regarding the City or the hotel amenities. For the price this is a real bargain.

<Content>We Loved This Place Too This is an outstanding small hotel. We normally stay at top rated BBs or mid-to-upper range hotels, and the Al Ponte was an excellent combination of both. In general, we would echo the other glowing reviews of this property, as they do an excellent job of describing the hotel and spirit of the people who work there.The location is less than 100 feet from the San Stae vaporetto stop on the Grand Canal, which turns out to be extremely convenient. For example, you can hop on the #1 Vaporetto and get a fabulous cruise of the canal all the way down to San Marco (St Mark's) Square. Or you can go the other direction for about four stops and arrive at the train station or the Plazza Roma bus terminal (to the airport). The Ca D' Oro stop is the next stop to San Stae on the line -- then you have only a 10 minute walk north to the dock for the Murano / Burano vaporetto. Vaporetto passes can be bought at the Rialto Bridge stop, which is only a short 10-15 minute walk away. We bought ours after wandering around the morning produce and fish markets right before the bridge. I would like to emphasize that the hotel is in a truly wonderful area, full of quiet neighborhoods containing a variety of squares, shops and restaurants. We always felt safe -- even after dark. After a while, we almost didn't want to go to the big sightseeing attractions -- since it was so enjoyable to just wander the local neighborhoods without all the tourist crowds.When we return to Venice, we will stay at the Al Ponte again -- in a heartbeat. By the way, we stayed in Room #6 which was nice. But if you want to splurge, ask about Room #10 -- it looks to have a 4 poster canopy bed and a balcony.

Very charming, clean and the staff is top notch! We especially love the little breakfast with the jam filled croissants that are to die for, served by the cutest little old woman. We stayed in room # 5 with a private balcony overlooking one of the small canals. It was very relaxing sitting on the balcony on a quiet evening listening to the city settling in for the night. We will be back again as soon as possible!

<Content>Lived up to the positive reviews My husband booked our trip to Venice to celebrate my 40th birthday. He chose and booked three nights at this hotel because of all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. Periodically, we would check the reviews and each time we were delighted by positive feedback (we just hoped that the hotel would live up to our expectations). WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED. The hotel is beautiful. It is decorated and maintained to a very high standard. All the staff from the owners right through to the ladies serving breakfast were so polite and attentive. This hotel may be a short walk from the main features of Venice, but after a full day walking around there was nothing nicer than to return to the beautifully lit courtyard, sit, relax and enjoy a drink. Thank you to Al Ponte Mocenigo for making my 40th birthday such a memorable experience and we certainly hope to return again one day.

<Content>Nice stay This hotel is in a nice quiet location, away from the crowds of the San Marco area. We had a huge room (in the pictures on Trip Advisor, it's called the triple room and it's decorated in red) which was very comfortable overall. The staff was nice, the breakfast was good and the patio area very pleasant. This isn't a high end hotel but it's comfortable, clean and a good value. It's really easy to find, right off a water bus stop. They offer free internet which was a huge bonus for my niece. The only real drawback in my mind was that my bed was very hard. My niece said hers was comfortable but I had a difficult time sleeping mine was so hard. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay. We also enjoyed the restaurant one block away - great mushroom pizza!

<Content>A Venetian Gem My husband and I stayed here for one night en route to Bologna as the only flight we could get to Italy was to Venice and regretted afterwards that we didn't spend the whole break in this lovely little hotel in this beautiful spot. The hotel is very small, as are the rooms, but the two young owners are very helpful and the property couldn't be more convenient - two stops on the water bus from the main bus station where the Ryanair bus from Treviso airport comes in. The room rate was very reasonable for the standard of accommodation and location and we will definitely return.

<Content>Very nice hotel My wife and I spent four nights at Al Ponte Mocenigo in June. Our flight to Venice was delayed and we did not arrive until late at night. We found the hotel without any problems and were greeted and shown to our room. We were in the standard room which was comfortable and had a good size modern bathroom. If I had one complaint it would be that the wardrobe is a bit small. The staff were extremely nice, breakfast in the courtyard delightful and the position very good. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>We loved it! My fiancee and I had a fantastic stay here in mid August. When we arrived we told that there was a problem with our booking, so we would be upgraded to a better room for the first two nights of our three night stay at no extra charge. We had no complaints about that. Then instead of moving us to the original basic double we booked on the third night, they moved us to an even better room than the first two! I can't recall Hilton ever upgrading me during a stay once a better room became available, and I'm Diamond VIP with them.The location is perfect. It's a nine minute ride from the bus depot or train station using the vaporetto system, which runs 24 hours a day so purchase a ticket good for as long as you will be in Venice. The area around the hotel is quiet and felt safe, even after dark when the lonely alleys of Venice can get a little creepy. The only thing I would change would be to make the beds a bit softer.

<Content>Book Early Look no further and remember to take the advice about booking early. My wife and I stayed 3 nights in mid-July. Our room was in the annexe but really I was surprised that the management even mention the 'annexe' because it could easily be seen as just part of the hotel. HExcellent location, easy to find and a bonus being only 3 stops from the train station when both arriving and leaving. Spotlessly clean. Have no concerns if your room is in the annexe, it is really no different from the rest of the hotel. This hotel just added to our excellent visit to the wonderful city of Venice.We would stay again if/when we return to Venice and obviously we would highly recommend this hotel without hesitation.Thank you Walter for your very warm welcome and the sincere hospitality shown by you and your staff throughout our stay. (We didn't get to meet Sandro as he was away on holiday.)

<Content>Fabulous second stay at this lovely hotel We have just returned from our 5 night stay at this lovely hotel. It is two years since our last stay and I thought perhaps standards could have slipped at little. However, standards are just as high as they were previously. My sister has stayed in the San Marco area on her previous visits and much preferred the area of this hotel. We stayed in the main part of the hotel, ourselves in the suite and my sister in the red triple room. Both rooms are very spacious with large bathrooms for such a small hotel. Although the hotel now has additional annexe rooms, we never had a problem getting two tables for breakfast in the small courtyard area. We all enjoyed sitting in the courtyard for drinks after a long day out and about and the prices are very reasonable, as are the drinks from the mini bar in the rooms. All the staff were very accomodating and helpful whenever asked any questions. Sandro and Walter are charming hosts.Travelling is very easy from this hotel, either by vaparetto or on foot and very easy to find from the San Stae stop. We purchased the 7 day travel Venice card and used this on a daily basis and turned out to be very good value. We also used it to travel to Burano and Lido - Burano is stunning!!We used Chow Venice for choosing places to eat and had some very enjoyable meals. My favourite was La Zucca, the pumpkin flan was very, very tasty. There is a restaurant literally yards from the hotel called Mura which was also very good. For ambience and a real authentic feel, I enjoyed Al Nono Risorto in Campo San Cassiano. There is nothing flash about this restaurant but that is what I liked about it - very cheap too.If you are considering a trip to Venice and don't want to be in the main tourist area surrounded by tourists, Santa Croce is ideal.

<Content>Are you being Served? If You're An American in Venice - Yes! We recently went on a European trip that included France, Venice, and Germany and ultimately stayed in a 4 different hotels. None of them came CLOSE to the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo in making an American family feel welcome.Highlights:Free wireless Internet. It didn't work initially due to room location so they PROVIDED an Ethernet cable and a power outlet converter so I could wire straight in. What a welcome bonus. So many hotels in Europe say they offer High Speed Internet but when you get there you find out it's often not free (closer to $30 per day) and often only in common areas. The courtyard. Very quaint, clean and quiet. Pigeon free. Don't laugh, in Venice this is an accomplishment. The food is rather pedestrian for breakfast, but the staff is wonderful, friendly and attentive. The owners. They are happy to converse at length with the guests and give well considered advice on what to see, where to park, and just as important, what NOT to do or where not to get ripped off.The staff. The entire staff takes their lead from the owners in making every effort allowed to ensure that those who stay feel fully taken care of. This is true of both the day and the night staff. No drop in quality of care.The temperature. Finally, in Europe, some place willing to cool a room to a crisp refreshing feel. After a day walking venice in 85 degree heat and 80 percent humidity - nothing line a nice chilly room to cool down. Reminded me of home!The cleanliness. Spotless. Everything. 'Nuff said.The price. Given the cost of some other spots within Venice, the rate was quite reasonable and we'd gladly pay it again. The only issue we had with the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo was that we had four days in Venice and they only had 2 nights available - the cost of being the top dog on TripAdvisor, I suppose. So if you're going to Venice, book well in advance and make sure you contact the hotel even if you don't see availability on the website. That's what we did, and the two nights we got to spend there were worth the disappointment of not being able to make it four.

<Content>A very welcome experience We arrived in Venice July 21 upon a water taxi and immediately got lost. Seems that the ticket taker on the taxi mixes her left from her right. After asking a clerk in an ice cream store where the Al Ponte Mocenigo hotel was, we were directed to the proper location. Carlito warmly greeted my wife and myself, helped us with the heavy baggage to our beautiful room in the annex and gave us easy directions to a nearby restaurant (Muro) which turned out to be a gem. And it only got better. The next morning we met our daughter at the San Stae dock which is only about 30 seconds from the hotel and the three of us proceeded to have a fabulous time running around Venice enjoying the sights and beauty of this gorgeous city. The breakfast served was perfect with fresh bread, juices, cruissant, cereals, fruit etc. Walter, one of the owners of the hotel was extremely helpful as well and then teamed us up with two other couples to share the water taxi with to the cruise ship port on the 23rd. He did the arranging and bargaining so that we saved some money. One of the couples turned out to be our constant companions for the next 12 days on the cruise - thanks to Walter. In all honesty, this hotel with it's charm, staff and beauty deserves the recognition they receive from Trip Advisor as being a #1 hidden gem hotel in Venice.

Located in quiet area but a quick 15-20 mins walk to San Marco square. Hotel staff were very helpful and breakfast was lovely (far surpassed expectations, Fruit, croissants, cheese, meat and lovely coffee made fresh from espresso maker) served in the little courtyard. While it has a 2 star rating, its because it doesn't have things like elevators, a big fancy lobby or iron for guests, but everything else about it was 4 star!

The hotel is a little gem - hidden down a back street but incredibly close to the grand canal ferry stop. Donnatello on reception was great, really helpful showing us the best places to visit on the map. The room was lovely, sumptuously decorated and very clean. I'd recommend this to everyone - but beware of the hard beds!

<Content>excellent small hotel We had a delightful 4 day stay at the Al Ponte Mocenigo in Venice at the end of June. The location is perfect, a very short walk from the San Stae vaporetto stop and one can walk everywhere from the hotel. We had a large room in the annex which was lovely and clean with all modern amenities. We ate in the courtyard of the hotel itself just around the corner from the annex entrance. Breakfast was bountiful with fresh fruit, croissants, cheese, etc. and the serving staff were so pleasant. Sandro and Walter recommended several restaurants nearby and we were delighted with all of them. The area is so quiet and we would go back to the same hotel on a return to Venice. It is a short ride or a walk to San Marco, an area we would certainly not stay in. It's just too busy. One can walk everywhere from our charming hotel and walk we did. We chose the hotel through other reviews we read on Trip Advisor and we were certainly glad we did.Kedzie

We booked 16 months in advance, so the anticipation was incredibly high based on all the previous reviews we'd read.It did not disappoint. Granted, the hotel is off the beaten path in Venice, but that is perfect. It is close to a vaporetto stop and really very convenient.Our rooms were immaculate, the decorations were elegant and the bathrooms are as well appointed as any 5 star hotel.I thought breakfast was perfect. Each morning when we stepped out of our rooms, we were greeted with the magnificent smell of fresh baked bread and croissants.Walter, one of the owners, could not have been more charming or helpful.Our only regret was not meeting Sandro as he was on holiday.

<Content>Easy to Find, Good Rate I have to be honest. This hotel gets great reviews and our expectations were very high. Finding the hotel was very easy. Get off at the San Stae stop, walk to the right of the church, and down the alley where there is a sign for the hotel where you ring the buzzer and get let in. We had room number 3, right next to the breakfast prep area (more on this in a minute). The room was nice. I didn鈥檛 find it worthy of praise. It was large, nice bathroom, fridge with mini bar. It was very clean and the bed was comfy.Now, I鈥檇 say that maybe you should ask not to have room #3 if you plan on sleeping much past 7am. We were awaken by the staff coming in and preparing breakfast, making cappuccino, dishes clashing, ect each morning. Not too much of an issue because we got up early to go sightseeing, but maybe a little earlier than we鈥檇 have wanted. The breakfast was ok. It was served outside on the patio. In our travels I found breakfast better at caf茅鈥檚 with the locals. This was our last stop on a 14 day trip that started in Naples. I鈥檇 say that it was average compared to the other hotels and BBs we stayed at. The rate was great compared to the other properties we looked at booking in Venice, so I guess therein lies the heart of the review. Great rate, easy to find, good location.

<Content>Perfect Spot in Venice All the positive reviews are absolutely true!Travelled with husband and two sons (aged 3 and 6 years old). Very close to main train station vaporetto stop (water bus stop), which was very convenient as we looked forward to get to the hotel asap after a 5 hour train ride from Rome.When we arrived at our stop: San Stae (Stae pronounced as star without the 'r'), it was literally a hop, skip and jump from the water bus stop. Off the ramp and less than 100m straight ahead. Because we read previous reviews, we did not miss the left turn into the tiny 3 feet wide street. We did however miss the door entrance to our right and nearly ended up in the water at the end of the street.We were warmly greeted by Donatello at the reception area. And after registering, he personally brought us to our room in the annex building, about 30 meters away, but still conveniently located, if not more than the main building because you did not have to turn into the tiny street.And yes, you need bags with wheels when travelling Venice (or anywhere else where alot of walking is required) and you need to be able to manage your bag and not depend on others help.Our room was gorgeous. It fit us four comfortably; and we had our queen bed, whilst the boys had a single bed and a sofa converted to a single bed (very comfortable). The bathroom was spotlessly clean with a nice handheld rain shower (which my son dubbed the frying pan shower) and good towels. Shower was decently sized compared to some other Italian ones we had.Our room no. was 24, which had a lovely view of a garden courtyard. It was on the first floor up two flights of stairs. We had lots of baggage but it was still manageable. Unless you're totally unfit, find a hotel with a lift, if not, this is worth climbing up stairs for. Having two young children, we were paranoid about the noise they were making due to the generally thin walls (common in Italy). But we didn't hear our neighbours and prayed that they didn't hear our kids! The rooms each had a light indicator above the room door outside the room, which we could tell who was in their rooms or not, so that enabled us to manage our kids noise levels better.Breakfast in the little courtyard was charming. Apricot jam croissants were delicious. Hot drinks freshly brewed, generous portions of fruit and juice. Children had their fair share of Coco Pops and other Kellogg's cereals.The local neighbourhood, San Stae, was perfect for our little family. The restaurants around the courtyard (and just beyond by the waters - next to the church) was great and accomodating to families. No problem for children to share a main dish. We had the opportunity to see the local children play ball, games, etc. which was entertaining for our own kids. None of the business of Piazza San Marco. In fact we looked forward to getting back to the neighbourhood at the end of every evening.Would definitely recommend to everyone and would definitely return. Just keep in mind that the space in and around the hotel common area is small but the room is big for Italian standards.Enjoy!

<Content>Favorite hotel in Italy!!! Beautiful hotel in perfect location. Just far enough from the crowds, but was only a 10-15 minute walk to the thick of things. The room was beautiful and the a/c kept us cool in the Venice heat. Sandro, Walter, and their staff are all very friendly and make this place as warm and inviting as everyone says it is. The breakfast here was the best we had in Italy (i miss the apricot croissants already) I feel fortunate to have stayed here during our honeymoon.

<Content>Hotels like this are rare All the positive reviews are true - this is an amazing find in a large, expensive city. We as 2 couples stayed in rooms #1 and #4 - I really liked #4. Room #1 had a window on the canal side (it was high and could not see out of it) - but you could smell the canal from the window and from the taxi/boat opening - not pleasant. #4 on the groundfloor overlooked the courtyard/make-shift breakfast area and you could open the door for fresh air. I would recommend this room.The staff are very friendly, especially the nightstaff person, a man from Malaysia. English is prevalent as most of the customers (probably because of Tripadvisor) were from Canada and the US. Guidebooks were on the counter to assist you, staff provided you a handy map (you are going to get lost anyhow) and were very helpful in suggesting restaurants in the area. The hotel was easy to access from the ferry dock, the hotel directions are great.I'm sure you won't see the reasonable price remain for this hotel which provides a great continental breakfast with marmalade croissants, cereal, coffee and juice which is served in the courtyard or inside if cold. The rooms are well appointed which a Venician flare. Make sure you try the drink of Venice called Spritz. Spritz is 2 parts white wine, 1 part Aperol (sweet  bitter orange drink made by Campari) with a splash of mineral water and lots of ice; usually served with plain potato chips/ We brought 2 bottles of Aperol home to Canada as you can not buy it here.There is access to free internet on the 2nd floor. There is also a room with a balcony over the canel on the 2nd floor but I don't think I would want to stay in it because of the smell from the canal. The taxi to the airport is 95 euro.The only complaint, other than my usual price of the mini-bar is the price of the sauna. Not sure who charges for a sauna, but you can use it between the hours of 3 and 5 pm for a costly 10 euro - not really sure why they even bother.Enjoy Venice and the hotel - you will never forget either of them.

<Content>A Gem that Deserves Its Top Rating I have visited Venice ten times and mainly stayed in four star hotels and above.Even before the dollar took its precipitous drop,I was curious about this hotel because of its No.1 ranking on tripadvisor and the laudatory remarks made by numerous travel publications. I could never get a room,even six months in advance,so I booked a room directly through the hotel and was finally able to obtain one. The hotel did not disappoint! It is immaculately clean,well furnished in the Venetian tradition with an extremely large,marble bathroom.The room,by the way,is huge by Venetian standards--and much bigger than the standard rooms in the beautiful five stars along the Grand Canal.The owners are wonderful,warm Venetians with old world charm and civility(even though they are young) !The location is superb---as when you first come in to Venice from either the railstation or the car park,simply get on the correct vaporetto,stay on for two or three stops,get off at San Stae and within two minutes you are at the hotel.The only downside is no elevator so if your mobility is lmited ask for a ground floor room.The breakfast is ample and of excellent quality--cappucino is well prepared.The entire staff is warm and welcoming.The neighborhood is authentic Venice--you will really enjoy the ambiance away from touristic San Marco.

<Content>A Beautiful Place in a Very Good Location Stayed here for three nights in June 2008, 2 adults and 2 teenagers in the annex rooms, second (third) floor. An absolutely beautiful place, clean and new with real Venetian decor (go to the Ca'Rezzonico museum and see the same style furniture you have in your room!). Breakfast was very good featuring home made apple croissants. I am a super light sleeper and on the first night heard noises from the private residence above our room - Walter and Sandro at the front desk contacted owner of the building the next day and immediately resolved the issue, they were super nice and helpful. Not hard to walk to this hotel from the train station - save some money on the overpriced vaporetto tickets and head there on foot.

<Content>A place to call home in Venice My daughter and I had a wonderful stay at the Ponte Mocenigo this week. The location is convenient via vaparetto and walking to/from was really quite easy and enjoyable. It was located in a quite neighborhood, far from the maddening crowd which was perfect for us. We stayed in the small bedroom on the first floor, Room #2. It was exactly as described, small and no view, but the price was great and really we only used our room to sleep in. Venice has so much to offer and the courtyard of the hotel was a great outdoor space to enjoy.  The night staff was especially helpful and gracious and made us feel welcome each time we came back after a long day in Venice. I would definately stay here again.

It is very easy to find after getting off the vaporetto at the St. Stae stop.Walter and Sandro were friendly and helpful. They make your stay even more enjoyable. The courtyard area is also a nice quiet place to rest after all the hustle and bustle of other areas of Venice.We really enjoyed being in a quieter quarter in venice especially since all of the major sights were easy vaporetto stops from the hotel. We walked easily to the Rialto fish market and the Rialto bridge area. We ate our evening meals in restaurants that were close to the hotel, and were reasonably priced.

This hotel is very charming, yet modern amenities and immaculately clean.The Front Desk staffs are very helpful recommending restaurants and providing information on how to get around Venice, which can be a bit daunting at first.The hotel provided your typical continental breakfast with Cappuccino, and the croissants were particularly good. The location was very good for getting around and it was easy to find the as it was a very short walk from the Grand Canal Ferry. If I were to return to Venice, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Fabulous hotel, great location As all the other reviews indicate, this is an exceptional hotel. Just the right balance of elegance and homestyle charm. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very spacious. We stayed in one of the annex rooms which are just in another part of the building from the main hotel. We were on the second floor with no elevator but Walter helped us get our bags in and it didn't really present a problem for us. The breakfast is served in a courtyard off the lobby in the main hotel. It was a delicious continental breakfast with warm croissants, fruit, cereal, and yogurt. Great cappucino and good service. Walter and Sando lived up to their great reputation for being gracious hosts. Very helpful with restaurant suggestions (go to La Zuppa for dinner--very close to the hotel and wonderful food). The location is great--not too touristy and yet easy to get everywhere. We traveled all over Italy for three weeks and this was our favorite place. We hope to go back someday.

<Content>Wonderful city break HOTELThis is a wonderful friendly Hotel based off the beaten track but close to all of the attractions. We stayed in room 2 which was right next to reception.The door lock was a little hard to open and it was perhaps little loud first thing for the light sleeper but nothing that would disturb the normal sleeper. The staff are very welcoming and will do all that they can to make your stay an enjoyable one.The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and had everything that you needed to make your stay comfortable.RESTAURANTSDont bother with the Hotels recommendation of Restaurant Zucchini unless your Italian is up to scratch and you want a limited choice of food options. Instead go just around the corner to Muros.... We both had a fabulous fish meal there and the service is excellent. Dont bother trying to eat around St Marks Square unless you want to pay over the odds for your food.BARSThese are very few and far between and it's not Party Central so make the most of the daytime as the evening activities are rather low key.SHOPSAlmost every other shop sells glass works (which are truly magnificent) or masks but there are a vast range of high quality designer shops around the Square and Rialto Bridge that would melt anyones flexible friend.PUBLIC TRANSPORTThe boat buses at 31 Euros for a three day pass are well worth the money. The service is very fast and efficient and a great way to see the city.The weather wasn't kind to us but we did have one gloriously sunny day. And remember that getting lost in the maze of Alleys is all part of the fun. !!Have fun

<Content>The Best...but don't tell anyone! We stayed in this beautiful hotel the end of May, 2008. We LOVED it! Our room was No. 32 in the Annex and it was sparkling and brand new. Walter mentioned that it wasn't quite complete as they would be adding pictures to the walls, etc. We loved it just the way it was. Our room had a separate sitting area and both rooms had exquisite murano glass chandeliers and large wood beams. The walls were covered in a soothing green brocade fabric. Wow. The bathroom was also very beautiful and spotless. We waited about 1/2 hour for our room to be ready because they had just that day turned on the new A/C for the season and the one in the sitting room was dripping from its 15 foot ceiling. Walter made sure we both had a glass of vino while we waited. That 1st night, the A/C leaked again and when we told Sondro the next morning he was all apologies. We told him no apology needed. We were more concerned with the dripping water ruining that beautiful floor and the ceiling below our room than anything else! Needless to say, while we were exploring Venice that morning, the A/C was fixed. Our room had a small balcony that could be reached by small french doors from the sitting room area. All of our windows faced the small calle. As I said in my title, Don't tell anyone about this hidden gem! Thanks again Walter, Sondro and your lovely staff.

A nice small hotel, just far enough away from the centre of Venice (about a 5-10 min walk) and only three stops from the railway station by water bus. We were in the annex and had a beautiful room with a courtyard view. Our room was clean and well appointed. Would not hesitate to stay again.

<Content>Great Location, Clean, Comfortable ... Awesome! The maps for Venice are deceiving ... this hotel looks like it's too far away from the action ... I contend it's just the right distance! Especially, if you like to walk and explore the city. Rialto is 15 minutes, St. Mark's is 20 minutes and the walking is wonderful. Shops, restaurants, sidewalk vendors, food markets - blissful!The hotel provides a delicious breakfast daily - the apricot croissants and coffee are divine; security - buzz in/buzz out, comings/goings are monitored by camera; gorgrous accomodations.Our room happened to be in the annex #22 with windows that opened onto the walkway below - nice to hear all that beautiful Italian language spilling into the windows. The bathroom was small, but more than adequate with a rain showerhead I thought I'd only see in the states. And, hot water. I was prepared for small rooms, cold water, etc. in Italy, but I never found that to be the case.We will stay there again next time we are in Venice - just a beautiful hotel and perfect location for us!

<Content>Wonderful repeat visit to Al Ponte Mocenigo This was a repeat visit for me, having stayed for 2 nights at the end of August last year. I loved it then and loved it this time when I stayed 3 nights. Last time I was in the main building and this time in the annex which was also done flawlessly well in terms of decor, charm, etc.It was great to see Walter and Sandro again and they were as welcoming and gracious as the last time I came as was the rest of the warm and friendly staff.The first night we ate at Al Ponte. The food is fine there but what is really wonderful is the location---watching the people and the boats going by is a real Venetian treat. Also ate at Il Muro (excellent steak but inattentive waiter) and La Zucca, a very good meal. Stopped numerous times at the gelato place right near the San Stae vaperetto stop and am missing it now.I really like the Santa Croce location, easily accesible to all the sights but not in the middle of the chaos. A good area to explore, especially the campo nearby where families gather before dinner.I'm sure there are other good places to stay in Venice but I'll never find out since this is it for me----can't wait to return.

<Content>Lovely, Enchanting Little Romantic Hotel in Venice We booked the hotel for our honeymoon this May (2008). Unfortunately, the honeymoon suite was unavailable, but they did everything to accomodate us, even giving us the lovely triple as a large romantic suite. The room was beautiful with wonderful red decor, a beautiful chandelier and a full bath. The location is great, as it is only a few stops on the ferry from the train station. The breakfast was great and the staff gave great directions and dining suggestions. It was hard to think we got such wonderful, five-star service in a charming 2-star hotel. Great bargain, yet not skimpy on the amenities!

<Content>wonderful hotel After spending much time researching hotels in Venice, we decided to spend our 2 nights in Venice here. We could not have been more pleased with the accomodations. Even though our room was on the main level at the registration desk, it was extremely quiet. The room was spacious and immaculately clean. We were about a block or so from the grand canal, in a quiet area but very close to the convenience of the grand canal. The complimentary breakfast contained a good variety of selections. We loved the red orange juice and have been unsuccessful in finding it at home. The entire staff were extremely helpful and friendly. It was a most inviting welcome and a wonderful start to our 10 day Italian vacation. If we get to return to Venice in the future, we'll definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>A little gem I booked this hotel for my husband's surprise 40th birthday trip and my decision was solely based on the tripadvisor reviews - so thank you for that!As mentioned so many times the owners, Walter and Sandro, were very welcoming, helpful and thoroughly charming.The hotel is hidden away but, armed with my tripadvisor advice, we spotted the small sign at the end of the tiny alley which leads to it!Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable - we were in room 23 on the lowest floor in the Annex. The only slight issue we had was that the room was pretty dark with not much natural light but it wasn't a problem.We had a slight problem on arriving in Venice where, after getting the ATVO bus to Piazzale Roma, we were then told that the ACTV boat service was closed due to a regatta that day - I'm not sure how often this happens but we ended up having to walk to the hotel as it's not accessible by car ! Not good in the midday sun - I would strongly recommend that you obtain a good streetmap before you go - if we hadn't had this we may still be searching for the hotel now !We ate at some excellent restaurants - Muro, which is literally two minutes from the hotel and is a bright buzzy and trendy place with excellent food; also Il Vagon, which is over the Rialto bridge (about 20 mins walk). It's in a lovely location on a bridge by one of the canals and is a peaceful haven within the buzzing Rialto area.Venice was, as expected, extremely busy so we took in the main sights on Sunday and Monday, and then headed out to Murano and Burano for the Tuesday, loving Burano so much that we went back there on the Wednesday! They really are worth seeing with tiny cafes and, in the case of Burano, a really pretty place with brightly coloured houses and tiny canals filled with fishing boats.We would definitely recommend getting an ACTV pass if you are going to be doing much travelling. We got a 3 day pass on the Monday morning (31 euro which currently equates to about 拢25) and so it even covered our return journey to Piazzale Roma on our way to the airport. We found the vaporetto system really easy to use and a very welcome respite for tired feet - it also helped of course that the hotel is only yards from the St Stae stop!All in all a lovely hotel, we had a great time; not sure when we will go back to Venice, but when we do we would certainly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>The Best Hotel! This is my favorite hotel in the world!Absolutely beautiful rooms, generously sized and amazingly appointed.We stayed here two years ago, were very, very impressed with the quality of the rooms and the amazing friendliness of the staff. This year, we stayed in the annex (a misnomer - this is the newly renovated section of the hotel, a 500 year old building with its own bridge off its beautiful courtyard (used for breakfast) over its canal, where the rooms are even more beautiful than in the original section. The owners, Sandro and Walter, are wonderfully friendly and helpful, and seem more like old friends than hoteliers.Especially interesting to me was the quality of their renovation: the wood work (baseboards, moldings, doors, etc., was of such high quality that I despair of ever finding furniture so well finished in the USA, let alone woodworking. The hotel is located within 50 yards of the St. Stae Vaporetto stop, in a non-tourist area (a big plus for us), yet very convenient for reaching all other popular parts of the city. The neighborhood is very relaxing, a good place to go after the crowds in San Marco. Some very good restaurants are located within walking distance, and we were able to walk to several of the Scuolae with the most important art work in Venice.I plan to return to this hotel each time we come back to Europe.

<Content>Best little hotel in Venice My husband and I were guests at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo from April 24 to April 26 2008. We were guests in the annex room 2.The hotel has everything going for it, location, service, cleanliness, charm, terrific staff, great morning breakfast especially the cappuccino and warm apricot croissants.Walter and his able staff are very available for giving directions, suggesting restaurants, finding water taxi's and meeting your every tourist need.The only improvement I could think of would be softer pillows.If it at all possible, consider this delightful hotel for your next stay in Venice.

<Content>Highly recommended! We have just returned from a three night stay and were delighted. Our room, #8 in the main building, had red brocade walls, was very quiet and, although not terribly large, had enough storage space for us to unpack and relax comfortably. The bathroom was modern and very clean. We were fortunate in having perfect weather and ate breakfast each morning in the lovely courtyard. Location could not be better - far enough from the crowds to be a peaceful haven but so convenient to the vaporetto and only a short walk to the Rialto area and other major sites. Another nice thing about the location is that it borders on the Campo Giocomo Dell Orio area which is full of businesses that cater to the locals. If you need a grocery, hardware or drugstore they are all there.All of the staff were friendly and helpful. We had high hopes for this hotel and it exceeded our expectations. That happens very rarely in our travels!

<Content>Value in Venice Having booked the Al Ponte Mocenigo at the start of the year we were very pleased to see it slowly climb the ranks of Trip Advisor to No.1. We arrived late at night and found the hotel easily from the vaperetto stop - despite reading of the difficulties other Trip Advisors had. Prior to arrival we had been warned we had a small double room - and that it was. But it was perfectly adequate for our 3 nights, very clean and comfortable and had a lovely bathroom. The furniture was ornate and in a venetian style.Breakfast was good, warm pastries and bread and gorgeous hot chocolate! Sadly it was a little too cold and wet to enjoy the garden and terrace area during our stay. The hotel has a great location, moments away from the Grand Canal, and 10-15mins walk in to the main hustle and bustle of Venice. There are plenly of good restaurants nearby - more choice than you would like when you only have 3days!A really lovely hotel, and good value for a very expensive city. My one minor criticism would be that our room was downstairs by the reception/breakfast area and so people arriving/leaving the hotel or having breakfast could be heard.

<Content>Fantastic - it's an injustice that this hotel has only 2 stars On our trip through Italy this was the first hotel we stayed in. They always had 10 rooms but recently expanded and now have 14. I think we stayed in the new bit but that's hard to be sure about. The experience was truly fantastic. From the moment we tried to book, when we arrived, when we were served and when we left it was all wonderful. The rooms are spacious and immaculate. Our room was classically decorated with all the mod-con's you could ask for. The hotel is a bit away from tourist centre like Plc St. Marco but you can walk there in about 15 minutes so that's no problem either. We found every member of staff to be as friendly as possible, which actually applied to most of the people in Venice (the only notable exception were the staff at Euro Car hire in Piazza Roma) It's a shame that through Trip Advisor everyone is going to find out about Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo because we can probably never get another one of these 14 rooms again...

Nothing seems to be too much trouble to get the answer to any question or queryThe rooms are spotlessly clean and Breakfast in the courtyard is very Romantic.While we were there it was rather wet so it gave them a chance to try out their new covered area.It worked very well so even if it's wet you can still have their wonderful breakfast outside.I would recommend this hotel unreservedly from our experiences

<Content>Gorgeous place Stayed in September 07. Found the hotel easily following the directions provided (bus from airport then vaporetto). The hotel is in a great location - easy to jump on a vaporetto and get to places yet away from the touristy busy areas.We had a room with a small balcony overlooking the side canal and it was gorgeous. The room was big and quiet.Staff were lovely recommending great places to eat / visit. Breakfast was lovely however we tended to skip it so we could enjoy the experience of ordering cornetto and coffee standing in the bar with locals!The hotel was just as it appeared on their website and really set the mood for our trip. Cant wait to visit again.

<Content>Just perfect! We booked seven rooms at the Al Ponte Mocenigo as we got married in Venice on April 9th. Our booking was made purely on Tripadvisor reviews and we could not have been happier with our choice.The hotel is located just a minute away from the San Stae stop and is easy to reach by water bus or taxi. (If like me you are unsure how to pronounce the name it is Al Ponte Motch-en-ego not Al Ponte Moss-en-ig-o)The hotel is small but incredibly welcoming and all of the rooms we booked were beautifully decorated. The rooms in the main hotel seemed to have baths and the annexe rooms had showers but we had no complaints at all from our guests. The rooms and public areas are also spotlessly clean. Beds are firm but really comfortable.Breakfast is delicious (particularly the famous apricot croissants!) and there is a reasonably priced minibar in the rooms. Internet access is free of charge.What makes this hotel so special however are Walter and Sandro and thir staff. Without exception, they are the most friendly and helpful people you will ever have the pleasure to meet. Walter and Sandro will answer endless questions and have an incredible knowledge and love of Venice while the housekeeping staff are friendly and happy and nothing is too much trouble.We couldn't have asked for a more special place to stay for our wedding and the hotel deserves all the praise it receives and long may it continue.

<Content>Rare Gem! Clean and cute rooms, nice courtyard, excellent service. My husband and I stayed at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo for 3 nights while we were in Venice April 9th - 12th. I booked the hotel, as others, based on the positive comments from fellow TripAdvisor reviews. Our expectations were exceeded! The hotel was beautifully decorated, CLEAN!, and the staff was so accomodating and nice. My husband said, I can't believe this is a 2 star hotel! The location is great, just off the public water transport stop and the hotel is easy to find (even at night) in a sometimes confusing city! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Venice!

The room was fantastic with high ceilings and fantastic furniture and the bathroom was large and everywhere spotlessly clean! The location is great - you can walk to everywhere you want to, and the area has some of the best shops and restaurants. The hotel also has a small courtyard garden where you can have breakfast when the weather is nice and the Owners are friendly, helpful and always there if you have any questions. Would definitely recommend this Hotel and would definitely stay there again if we go back to Venice.

<Content>First class We booked this hotel because of the great reviews on trip adviser, and we were not at all disappointed. It is small but cosy, impeccably maintained and very clean. However, the bedrooms are a good size, (we had a large double bed , plus two singles added for two children and still plenty of room). All of the staff, be it owner, chambermaid, or night receptionist are extremely friendly, welcoming, and very helpful. It is in a good location far enough away from the commercialism of the main attractions, but only a short scenic walk when required (10 mins Rialto Bridge, 15 mins St Marks Square).

<Content>Perfect location for sight seeing We returned yesterday from a four day visit to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This hotel was recommended by a good friend who has stayed there 3 or four times. This was our first visit to Venice and we were not disappointed. VENICE do not be put off by the transport system it is very simple. From each airport you catch a blue coach (3 Euros) to the city bus station. You walk 100 metres to the water bus jetty catch the appropriately numbered water bus to the floating  very prominently marked landing station. Then the fun starts finding your way throught the alleyways  over the little bridges to your hotel. HOTEL Booking was simple  easy. Both owners speak very good English  one is always on site. Finding the hotel was no problem. Get off as instructed  walk about 50 metres with no bridge crossings if you go through the back door - look up high on the wall to the left for the small hotel sign at the entrance to the alleyway. This is an excellent location if you have large bags,children or should you find steps  luggage challenging. We stayed in the annex which is four rooms in the building behind the hotel. It was very private  quiet. You will not hear the boat engines here. It was a very quick 1 minute walk to the hotel for breakfast. ROOM was newly fitted very clean  well furnished. En suite was pristine  towels replaced daily. Small fridge in room with space for you to place your own goods in if required. Breakfast was plentiful.(continental) try the hot chocolate to start with  English brakfast tea. There is a guest internet facility available located on the first floor free of charge - handy for flight confirmations. LOCATION - perfect walking times:- Rialto Bridge 20 mins / St. Marks square 25 mins / Bus-water bus station 15 mins / Aresenal 40 mins. There are plenty of good local restaurants - our favourite was the Muro Pizza just behind the hotel (meal for 2 with drinks 28 Euros) Do not be put off by this hotel's two star rating - if you require a good room with a breakfast this is the hotel for you.

<Content>Wonderful stay, lost for an hour trying to find it This wonderful B  B made for an excellent stay. There is not much more I can add to what the other reviewers have written. Like the others, I agree the hosts were excellent, the place is kept very clean and it has a very comfortable feel. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of thinking the water taxi would deliver us to the front door. When it dropped us off at the San Stae pick up point we were in trouble. I pulled out the address and could not find the street. We walked for over an hour late at night and had patrons at a restaurant call twice for us. Even with directions, the first time we still got lost and had to re-circle our steps.Would this deter me from staying there鈥攁bsolutely not! Just get off at the station go 50 yds and turn into the 3 foot wide alley and you鈥檙e there. Very simple but very difficult in the dark and going off a map. Learn from our lesson and be prepared.I will add one thing that may be a concern for some people. One of the selling points of staying in this hotel is the location. It is away from the crowds but still an easy walk to the main areas and train station. The area gives an excellent feel for un-touristy Venice. I loved that. However, be aware that later at night the streets and alleys will be almost deserted. My wife and daughter walked back from the opera to meet me at a restaurant and were a little concerned. They walked through alleys that we would never walk through in the U.S. at night. Again, would this deter me? No, I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Enjoy your Chianti on the very cool patio and immerse yourself in one very unique and wonderful city.

<Content>Cosy  I selected the hotel in Venice purely on Tripadvisor reviews (and subsequently confirming that it met our needs and budget by checking the hotel website). We stayed here for 7 nights (March 2008).Ordinarily, I would not have selected a 2* hotel, but the reviews sold it to me. The hotel met and exceeded our expectations - all of the staff were extremely courteous and helpful throughout our 7-night stay, it was a good size meaning that our privacy was respected but simultaneously we were not 'anonymous guests'. The room was modern yet retaining Venetian features, and importantly was lovely and cosy too - Venice was quite cold during our stay, and we particularly appreciated getting back to the warm room in the late afternoons before heading out to dinner. The bathroom was a good size and modern too, and was cleaned with fresh towels provided on a daily basis. Breakfasts were delicious too. Like others' reviews, I cannot understand how this hotel is not 4 star.If I had to be really pedantic, the only improvement which I could suggest would be an extra choice of healthier breakfast cereal in addition to the Cornflakes and Muesli (eg Branflakes or Weetabix instead of CocoPops - but these may not be available in Italy) and a tea-tray in the room to make a cup of tea or coffee (but I think that this is probably a feature of UK hotels rather than a feature of hotels in mainland Europe).

<Content>Loved our stay We took the word of so many of you at Trip Advisor that this was the place to stay in Venice and we were NOT disappointed. We arrived later than planned and so it was dark when we disembarked from the vaporetto. Armed with great directions I took from this forum we found our way right to the front door, maybe 50 yards from the stop. Later we mostly used the back door which was fairly hidden down a very narrow walkway but easier to navigate with our bags and so forth.We stayed 5 nights in the room just off the breakfast nook, RM 4 I think, which overlooks the outdoor patio. This room is pictured in the lower right of their pocket map. It was just right for us - big enough, nice new bathroom with tub/shower, a small table and 2 chairs, a big lounge chair, a mini bar which we didn't use nor did we use the TV. Like another traveler mentioned, you could hear the door bell buzz in the evenings when people were coming back but this small annoyance was totally overridden by the delight of waking up to the entoxicating smell of freshly baked croissants and rich Italian coffee every morning -heaven!Both Walter and Sandro were very hospitable and the lovely ladies in the kitchen were also very personable. But I think what made it for me was the location. It was so convenient to the vaporetto and to wonderful restaurants and gelaterias within short walking distance. Still far enough away from the madding crowd that you appreciated the quiet evenings. We did have a special auditory surprise. One evening when we were leaving by the back door down the narrow alleyway, we heard a beautiful soprano voice practicing vocal scales coming from the building right next door. Later, when we inquired from Walter and Sandro who this might be, they admitted the voice belonged to a professional European opera singer but didn't know her name. If we ever go back to Venice we will definitely stay at Al Ponte Mocenigo and if we manage to hear that amazing voice again, I will not hesitate to knock on the door and pay my respects with a Brava!

<Content>Sorry Folks , Another good review My wife and I have just spent four nights at al ponte mocenigo , we stayed in the annex which is in the same building but about a 50 mtr walk to the hotel for breakfast, Umberellas are supplied if it is wet, The hotel is clean and well looked after by very nice people. The only issue we had was that they are renovating the upper floors and the next building which caused some noise and saved us setting the alarm clock,!! having said that it did not really bother us that much as we wanted to be up out anyway.The main peice of advice that I would give is if you are arriving after dark and not sure where you are going pay for a private water taxi 90 euros and it will take you to the door. we took the vaporatto back to the airport for 12 euros each but we would have struggled to do it the other way in the dark, all in all a great trip great hospitality dont stay anywhere else in venice.

<Content>Exquisite rooms- amazing service! This was the most amazing hotel we staying in during 3 weeks in Europe. I cannot believe it's only a 2 star, it felt more like a 4 star. We arrived early in the morning, and although our room wasn't ready we were welcomed to a hot breakfast. Then, we asked to upgrade to a larger room (the rooms in other cities were too small) and the receptionist moved us into a SPLENDID mini-suite with a dressing room, gorgeous marble bathroom and gorgeous Venetian decor. It was absolutely the most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed in. The room was kept spotless by the housekeeping staff, who were very friendly. The little old Italian lady who made breakfast baked these heavenly croissant filled with apricots fresh every morning and the BEST cappuccino of my life. Here's the best part... when I checked out, we wound up being charged LESS for the larger room than we'd booked for the small room! It was an unbelievable experience all around and I would go back to Venice simply to go back to this hotel. It would make a perfect romantic rendezvous, or a girl's weekend. If you go to Venice, you simply must go to this hotel!

<Content>A little gem within walking distance of everything I discovered the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo in an article called 'Venice's Hidden Hotels' (Fiona Duncan - 13/3/07) in the Daily Telegraph travel section. It is described quite correctly as a 'cosy bolthole offering value for money', however, there is much more besides for anyone searching for comfort and a little bit of venetian charm. This really is a little gem and definitely made our trip to Venice. It is very easy to get to, only 2/3 stops from Piazzale de Roma to San Stae on Vaporetto 1 and then a 1 min walk to the door of the hotel. We stayed in the triple room on the first floor which was comfortable, spacious and decorated in a simple though almost Palazzo grandeur. The bathroom was warm, roomy, very clean and had a bath and shower. We both slept very well during our 3 nights. Breakfast is simple but yummy - warm croissants, yoghurt, cereal, some fresh fruit, bread rolls, toast and lots of jams etc. Breakfast is served downstairs in the hall way and upstairs on the first floor outside the bedrooms. Its fine if you are downstairs but sitting upstairs on the landing was a little odd. In summer it must be delightful though as everyone eats in the little courtyard at the front. In terms of location I thought it was ideal - close to the centre (10 mins to the Rialto bridge and about a 15/20 min walk to San Marco) and yet far enough away to escape the crowds when you had had enough sight seeing for one day. We walked everywhere only using the Vaporetto to get to the hotel and on our last day to get to Santa Maggiore. I am over six months pregnant and still walking wasn't a problem, nothing is very far and if it is, there are plenty of places to stop and have a drink and rest. We considered getting a 72 hr vaporetto ticket but were glad we didn't. Really not necessary. The hotel staff were excellent in every way - no problem booking with very prompt responses by email, really helpful with restaurant recommendations and bookings and always ready to chat about Venice and the sights. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. We didn't do gondolas, operas, vivaldi but we did do Florians for tea on our last day and it was a real treat. After a day of sight seeing in rather cold weather it was lovely to walk inside this buzzy tea room full of old world charm. We had tea and scones for two for 鈧?0, expensive, yes but worth it for the experience. And it must be said the tea and scones were delicious.

The hotel was absolutely spotless, the staff very polite and friendly and the hotel is really perfectly located only 5 minutes walk from Rialto and right beside a Grand Canal stop. Our only down point was the room location which was directly off the reception/dining area and impeded somewhat on our privacy. No other complaints to be honest.

<Content>Venice hospitality at its best Stayed here for two nights in January and could not fault it.Our room was spotlessly clean and a very good size.All communications prior to our trip with Walter and Sandro were answered promptly and recommendations for restaurants were very good.The nightly rate for a hotel of this standard in Venice is exceptional given the size of the rooms and what is included in the rate.Drinks from both the bar in the hotel and mini fridge are very reasonable.The only minor criticism I would have is that the breakfast area is cramped although I think this is only during the winter when the outside terraces are not open otherwise I am sure it would be fine. Don't be put off by the location of the hotel if you think it is too far from the main sights. It is only 10 minutes walk to Rialto Bridge and 15-20 minutes to St Marks but restaurants and bars around it are good and do not charge tourist rates but serve very good food at reasonable prices.We have been to Venice four times and I would now choose this Hotel first in the future.You will not be disappointed.Mike and Sharon

<Content>Venetian Class We spent 3 nights at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo and felt we had discovered a real gem. It was a quaint old building with a wonderful courtyard for breakfasts and afternoon drinks. It was quiet and the rooms were very clean, comfortable and well appointed (although, if we were to be particularly picky ours was a little dark as it had very few windows). The staff were very helpful and well informed and we received particularly good recommendations for dining out and very good directions (which are essential in Venice!). It was handy, either by foot or water taxi, to the major points of interest and close to the intriguing maze of back streets and canals which make this part of Venice so unique. We would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good value hotel in a wonderful neighbourhood which gives you the chance to really experience the best of Venice.

<Content>Just like the pictures Our family enjoyed 3 nights at the Hotel al Ponte Mocenigo earlier this month. We were given room 10 as there were 4 of us and there was plenty of room . The decor is very shabby chic with highly decorated furnishings and ceilings. The bathroom was very modern and there was plenty of hot water. My yougest son found the sloping floor highly amusing.The hotel gave us very clear directions and we easily found the hotel from the water vaperetto.Sandro was very attentive and always available with information regarding day trips, restaurants etc.Being winter the courtyard was not used and everyone had breakfast downstairs on up in the first floor. There was plenty of food provided at breakfast with cereal, yoghurt, fruit, croissants, breadrolls, cappacinos and hot chocolate.Thank you to all the staff who made our stay a memorable one.

<Content>Fantastic Stayed at Al Ponte Mocenigo after reading the reviews on this website and was not disappointed. Its was so easy to get to from the airport - a coach and a water bus only 9 euros per person in total. The room was fantastic, really clean, quiet and large. We had breakfast delivered to us every morning and staff were really helpful. The courtyard is really pretty and its so close to eveything while being out of the main touristy area. Perfect! Would and already have recommended this place to everyone I know.

<Content>Loved it here! Book this little gem of a hotel and you won't be disappointed!! On arrival into Venice as you come through customs look left and you will find the ACTV desk which is were you need to purchase your 12/24/48 hours travel pass for the bus/vaporetti you will need for your stay in Venice. Leave the desk and walk outside and take the number 5 bus which is from the second row. The number five bus takes you to Pizzale Bus station which link you up with the popular number 1 Vaporetti which will take you into Venice. The stop you will need for Al Ponte Mocenigo is San Stea which is the fourth stop on the number one. From the airport to the hotel it takes about 40 mins. If money is no object then take the water taxi but it's 95鈧?and as the Vaporetti is so easy I would take it everytime. We arrived at the Al Ponte Mocenigo and found it easily after you get off at the stop walk to the left and you will see a little bridge this is the entance. The rooms were lovely and the staff are so friendly. We arrived and I had already asked Sandro to book us a table at a restaurant called the Vini Da Gigio which I heard some great things about on Tripadvisor, he had made the reservation and directed us there easily. What we hadn't known before we went is that Venice is so small and getting about is so easy, The restaurant was excellent and again the followig night Sandro had booked us into another restaurant close by called La Zucca another lovely choice. Breakfast is lovely warm coisants and cereal with gorgeous coffee. Nothing it seems is too much for the staff here and they welcome you to leave your bags with them on the last day after you have checked out which is 11am. Everything is close by even though on the map it isn't it really is only 10 minutes to St Marc square and the Rialto Bridge. I wouldn't stay anywhere else and I am already booking for September. Have a great time.

<Content>The jewel in the Crown Booked this hotel after reading the reviews and we were not disappointed - far from it!! It really is delightful, as are Walter and Sandro. It is so convenient and easy to find, less than 100 metres from the Vaporetto. We had room 8 on the 1st. floor, which was beautifully furnished with an excellent en-suite. The hotel is ideally situated whether on foot or by water bus. Will definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>A real pleasure My partner and I booked two nights at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo, and ended up extending our stay by an extra night. Time permitting, we would have loved to stay longer.Venice's numerous attractions are well known, and you surely can't do much better than the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo for its location, good value and general atmosphere.I'm sorry to say that my general impression of the average Italian vendor (be it in a shop, restaurant or museum, etc.) is not positive - the notion that a customer should be treated with at least a sliver of courtesy has apparently not found its way inside the famous boot. However, this can definitely NOT be said of the staff and owners of Al Ponte Mocenigo, who were lovely in every way - friendly, helpful, courteous, and charming.The Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is situated in a quiet spot, yet is still no more than 10 minutes walk to the Rialto and beyond to St Marks. There is a very handy vaporetto stop a minute away too. The superior rooms are spacious and comfortable, the bathrooms are great, and the breakfasts delicious. Highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! I loved this hotel from the beautiful and roomy rooms to the friendly hotel staff and owners. After traveling extensively through Italy, this was by far the best hotel we stayed at. The location is convienient as well (once you are familiar with the area) and very close to the vaparetto stop. If I return to Venice, I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Elegant gem My best friend and I came from exploring Rome to Venice, and the Mocenigo was such an amazing respite from hot, busy Rome. It was quiet and peaceful but located within a short walk to most of the must-sees. We happened upon a restaurant not far from the hotel, that you would easily miss if not for the little menu table they place outside the restaurant in the evenings. The ambiance of this restaurant had my best friend and I both wishing we had come here with a significant other, instead of a buddy, even more so than the quasi-romantic Gondola Ride. Does anyone who stayed at Mocenigo know which restaurant I found? I never did get the name, and I'd love to recommend it to friends and family. The food and wine were other-worldly. If anyone has any suggestions as to what the name of this gem is, could you kindly send me an e-mail to platinumforests@yahoo.com. Happy traveling!!!Beth~

<Content>Alone with Venice in Winter I was inspired to visit Venice by David Plante's article in the New York Times titled 'Alone with Venice in Winter'. He evokes the romantic sense of isolation that you don't get in crowded Venice, where you are more aware of the people looking at the city than the city itself. For me, Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo was a reflection of Venice in winter: authentic, calm, romantic. Even though I was travelling by myself I did not hesitate to book a room here because it made my day complete to come home to a place that was an extension of the city's identity. If I have anything new to add to the many glowing reviews this hotel has received, it is that even single travellers can enjoy the experience.Sandro, Walter and all the staff were great. I will never forget the many wonderful conversations shared with the staff, and the little things, like Sandro straightening the collar of my jacket on the day of my departure. I arrived as a guest and left as a friend. The experience was truly magical.

<Content>we loved our stay there We stayed there for 5 nights in December for our vocation and we had great experience. I still couldn't believe that it's a 2 star hotel: the interior is very well done, the room and bathroom are very comfortable, it's 1 block away from ferry station and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I can't say enough good thing about this place. I am a frequent business traveler so I am very used to 5 star chain hotels, but this hotel is so wonderful and intimate, I would rather stay here. One thing worthy mentioning is a nearby local restaurant called Nono Risorto. It's reasonable priced and offer excellent pasta and Pizza dishes. You should definitely try it.The owners of this hotel is restoring some other units in this building and they are doing a great job. I believe they will continue to be one of the best in Venice.

<Content>Gorgeous and well-located; we loved it! We spent 4 nights at this hotel in June and absolutely loved it. It was somewhat more expensive than the other hotels we stayed in during our month-long European vacation, but it is reasonably priced by Venetian standards. We loved the location - it's just far enough off the beaten path to enable you to escape the madding crowd, but it's an easy and lovely walk to anywhere you want to go. We had no problem whatsoever walking to San Marco in about 15 minutes and once we saw the crowds and all the kitschy tourist shops along the way, were so glad to be staying out of the thick of it. In fact, to see Venice at her most charming, walk from the hotel in the direction AWAY from San Marco and get lost in the winding alleys and meander through the gorgeous campos. It is a stunningly beautiful place, wholly unique and postcard-perfect.But back to the hotel - the room was nice, clean, modern, and the bed was very comfortable. Walter and Sandro, along with everyone else who worked there, were very friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was so, so good. It was a light breakfast (no hot dishes) but it was definitely a great way to start the day. They had their famous hot apricot-filled croissants, great coffee made the way you like it (cappuccino - so so good - macchiato, espresso, etc), other breads with Nutella and jams, fresh juices, yogurt, etc. The courtyard they serve breakfast in is charming enough during the daytime; when you come back to it at night, dimly lit behind the heavy iron gate, just over an adorable bridge, it feels like something out a dream, like you're coming back to your own Venetian palazzo. In short, it was wonderful and I'd love to stay here again!! (BTW: it's a bit of a hike, but if you're in Venice, don't, don't, don' t miss out on eating at Vini di Gigio. One of the best meals we had in all of Europe!)

<Content>Perfect Hideaway and Great Hotel I read great reviews about this hotel online and decided to give it a try. The rate was pretty good for off season, but I was concerned about the location as it's not in the main touristy areas. I need not have worried as it was just perfect. In fact, it was good to be off the beaten path a bit as the area felt very local and was very quiet. Not too many tourists stomping around and you're only a few stops on the vaporetto away from everything. It's also only about 15 minute walk to Piazza San Marco.I recommend reading about the vaporetto and how to use it. We got out of the train station and knew exactly where to be and what to do. There were lots of disorientated tourists. The hotel is very easy to find and the you know you're onto a good place as soon as you see the nice little courtyard entryway. The reception people were all extremely friendly and helpful. It rained both days so they gave us complimentary umbrellas too. Our room was upstairs on the canal side (not the grand canal) and we had a beautiful view. The room itself felt very grand and much more expensive that it really was. The bathrooms and everything were modern and the antique furniture in the room is great.We never got a chance to try the the free breakfast as we decided to sleep in, but it was served downstairs by the courtyard. We heard about the great gelato place right behind the hotel, but it was closed until January or so while the owners were on vacation. We found another gelato/crepe place a few bridges behind it and that was great. The vaporetto was extremely easy to use and I recommend the passes (depending on how long you stay). If you want a cheap gondola ride, try the targhettos that locals use to cross the river where there's no bridge. They were only 50 cents and quite fun (standing room only). The location of the hotel was good also as it was very close to the fish/fruit markets by the Grand Canal, and the Rialto bridge was also nearby.Signs are clearly marked which tell you which direction the big squares and landmarks are, but I found that the maps made the place look bigger than it was. Venice is very accessible and quite small. Try to also find a map that has detailed streets as there are a lot of alleyways, etc.Anyway, I really recommend this hotel. It's very quaint and a nice little hideaway. It was nice to come back to a warm place during the heavy rains.

<Content>Return Visit to a Charming Hotel I first stayed at Hotel al Ponte Mocenigo in March 2006. In my Tripadvisor review, I said I'd found a new favorite Venice hotel. Returning in late November 2007, I was pleased to find the same charming place, the same friendly and helpful staff, the same comfortable, well-appointed impeccably-clean rooms.Splurging on a water taxi from the airport, we were welcomed at the water door by Walter. Since it was so early, our rooms were not yet available, but Walter sat us down with cappuccinos and pastries.Both our rooms were adjacent to the lobby--very roomy with large bathrooms--I think intended to be wheelchair-accessible. All the doors and and bathroom fixtures could accommodate a wheelchair. Guests can reach the hotel itself from the San Stae vaporetto stop without going over a bridge. Even though we were right off the lobby, we were not troubled by noise--the room doors are extra thick.The main part of the hotel has just ten rooms. After two nights, we were switched to the new annex of four more recently-added rooms in the same building. While one must go outside the hotel and around the corner to reach the annex, it was still very convenient. The street door to the annex and hallway is monitored via camera by the hotel desk. Our rooms here were similarly appointed, though the bathrooms were smaller. The annex is one floor up a short flight of stairs.My friends were very impressed with the hotel. It was cloudy and rainy for our entire five-day visit, but the kind helpfulness of Walter, Sandro, and their staff brightened each day, making it an even more memorable visit to Venice.

The location was really great as we were able to walk everywhere we wanted in 15 minutes or less. The room was really nice and the bathroom beautiful. We loved our breakfast in the morning and chatting with the other guests. The front desk service was excellent and we really enjoyed the restaurant they recommended. Our only regret was that we only had one night as would have loved to stay longer. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Venice.

<Content>Excellent Choice for the Picky Traveller I'm a picky traveller and tend to research and agonize before I finally select a vacation hotel. We selected the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo for our recent trip to Venice and it was excellent. It's a small hotel but clean and comfortable, with a great staff and very good breakfast. The location was excellent. We stayed in Room #5, which has a balcony overlooking the small canal that runs along the front of the hotel and also has a large window overlooking the courtyard where breakfast is served. This hotel is an excellent value and I highly recommend it. Take it from me, book this hotel and relax knowing you made a great choice!

<Content>A so-so Junior Suite The staff was terrific and location is great. In our favorite part of the city and great for repeat visits when one can just walk and get lost. Although it is a lovely building, we were somewhat disappointed with our Junior Suite. The room was large but quite bare and cold feeling. Also, the lighting in the bathroom was only on the ceiling with no direct lighting on the mirror. It was the only bath in this price range during our month of travel that did not have a wall-mounted magnifing mirror, which would have made up for the poor lighting. The wall sconce lights beside the bed were poorly positioned  had really low lights. One had to tuck in all the canopy fabric situated between lights and bed frame to get enough light to read anything in bed. Hard to find in the dark, so try and arrive early. Good breakfast.

<Content>Worthy of all the praise I booked this hotel after reading the Trip Advisor reviews. The hotel is truly worthy of the rave reviews it gets here. Venice is notorious for overpriced, run-down hotels, and the city itself is chaotic and touristy, but at the end of each day of sightseeing, it was so nice to come back to this cozy, quiet retreat.The pride of ownership really shows in this little hotel. It's immaculate, everything is beautifully maintained, and you can tell that the guys who run this place love it.The location is great- right behind the San Stae stop. The convenience of this cannot be overstated. I don't know how we would have found our hotel, had it not been located right behind a vaporettto stop- Venice is really confusing, and not condusive at all for pulling around a suitcase.Breakfast is great, it's served in the lobby (during cold weather) and on the patio- cappuccino, homemade croissants (which you smell cooking duing the day- yum!) and muffins, fruit and yogurt, all arranged just so .Don't hesitate to visit this hotel. You won't be disappointed!

<Content>Just what you are looking for This hotel has everything you would want. It is beautifully unique, service welcoming, breakfast plentiful, excellent location, and quiet. Being right near the vaparetto stop makes carrying luggage easy and getting to other places. Our room in the annex overlooked a beautiful garden/courtyard with grapes growing at the window. It was nice to be away from the noise and yet close to transportation, the fish/produce market, and a lot of local shops and places to eat. Just don't think the pictures do it justice. It is much more beautiful!

<Content>Most secerene My wife and I decided to go with Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo based on the reviews listed and we were very happy with the choice. THe breakfast was great, staff were friendly and helpful, making for a most pleasent stay. The room we stayed in didn't have a view and the shower screen arrangment was a little awkward, but the room presentation, cleanlyness and service maked it a great place to stay. I was initally concerned about the location being so far away from the main part (St Mark's square) but the tranquility, ease of getting around Venice and hidden treasures of the area were actually a positive. Very happy with this choice.

<Content>Can't wait to go back to the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo WOW- we fell in love with this hotel the moment we arrived. It is so convenient to get to. We missed the first bridge and were looking for the alternative entrance, but eventually (only after about 5 minutes - the only time we were ever lost in Venice) found the front gate. What a beautiful place. We stayed in a small double the first two nights and a larger double room the last night. We packed up our stuff and the staff moved all of our luggage to the new room while we were out enjoying the city. The service at this hotel is top notch. They could not do enough for you. Both of our rooms were located right off the lobby but I never heard any noise - not even in the morning when people were getting breakfast ready or eating in the lobby if it was too cool in the courtyard. The breakfast was perfect. We had enough that we did not eat again until dinner. The courtyard was so quiant and lovely. Venice is a very easy city to get around in but if you needed help, Walter and Sandro were always there to help you. In fact, they gave us directions to a neighborhood church so that we could attend mass on Sunday morning. It was very interesting to attend mass given in Italian in a local neighborhood. We cannot say enough good things about this hotel. We stayed there for 3 nights before boarding a cruise ship. After comparing places that other cruisers stayed we had the best deal in Venice. The other people stayed in very nice places and had great service but paid almost twice as much per night that we did. That was the bargain of Venice. One last thing....the rooms and the bathrooms were so clean. Clean bathrooms is a big thing for me and I could have just stayed in the bathroom. YOu will thoroughly enjoy your stay.

<Content>made our Venice experience perfect We have just returned from a month in Europe most of which consisted of a French river cruise and a Med cruise. We spent three days in Venice in between and of all the places we visited I loved Venice the most and can't wait to go back. When I do, one thing is for sure, Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is the ONLY place I will stay. For us it was perfect in every respect. Access by vaporetto is so easy both on arrival and every day use. San Croce is a residential neighbourhood and with a little guidance from the owners Walter and Sandro we were able to eat and shop locally and experience the life of everyday Venetians.The hotel is a dream if you want to stay in a place that makes you feel like a welcome visitor, from its elegant rooms, its cleanliness, its gorgeous courtyard and its quietness. Walter gave us excellent directions (this was after we finally acknowledged to ourselves that getting completely disorientated at the Rialto Bridge we were not as clever as we thought and that perhaps a little help might not be a bad thing) and we found him always approachable. The only thing we regretted was that we could not stay longer. Stay at this hotel, you will be glad that you did!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We found this hotel to be wonderful in Venice. Sandro, Walter and the rest of the staff are wonderful and run a great hotel. It is located in a quiet neighborhood, close to a vaperetto stop and just off the grand canal. It is a reasonable walk to activities around the Rialto Bridge (5 to 10 min) and St. Mark's Square (10 to 15 min). We enjoyed the short walk from all of the crowds of Venice to the quiet of the hotel - it felt like we were on vacation from all of the touristy-ness of Venice.The staff had excellent maps of Venice along with great recommendations for dinner. They were most helpful with reservations. Also, Sandro went out of his way to help us confirm our hotel reservation in the next city that we visited. The service from the staff was top notch.The hotel was renovated quite recently (within the last 3 or 4 years) and it is in very nice shape. Breakfast is in a beautiful courtyard and is a typical European breakfast. Hot coffee or tea are served along with fruit, cold cereals, yogurt, rolls and jams. It was a great way to start our day.We stayed in a standard room for one night (140 euros) and a superior room for two nights (160 euros). The difference between the rooms is the room size and the view or lack of a view. I felt that the superior room was definately worth the extra cost for a bit of a view and the extra room. If possible, I would recommend room #5 (with a balcony), with room #6 being a second choice. Ask about the room views as you book your room.The bathrooms were big enough, but we're talking about European bathrooms. The bed was comfortable and we had all that we needed in the room.I would recommend this hotel for the staff, the location, the rooms and the relative value (for Venice). I would recommend against this room if you feel a need to be located close to the Rialto Bridge or St. Mark's Square (after trying to convince you to enjoy the walk and stay away from the traffic).Overall, we would highly recommend the Hotel al Ponte Mocenigo. We truly enjoyed our stay there and if we go back to Venice, we would likely stay here again.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic! Our family of four (two adults, two teenagers) stayed here for four nights in late September - I had read about it over 12 months ago on the trip advisor site and booked it based on the glowing reports. It is everything that everyone has already reported on and more! The location is brilliant as it is tucked away from the tourist hustle and bustle and yet it is so convenient to get to all the main attractions as the vaporetto stop is right at the end of the hotel alley way.The two rooms we booked (one with the four poster bed (and the other one upstairs and decorated in red) were absolutely gorgeous in terms of decoration, cleanliness and size including the bathrooms! Breakfast was lovely and served in the courtyard.Walter and Sandro were extremely welcoming and friendly and gave great recommendations on how to get to places and where to eat.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We were in the new annex and our room had separate room with an extra tv and sofa. All the rooms are beautifully decorated and always kept immaculate.When and if we go back to Venice we will definately go back to Al Ponti Mocenigo - that's if we can get in with all the good reviews they receive and deserve.

<Content>Romantic, welcoming, cosy  My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in Oct 2006, and a year on (I'm slow to get around to reviews) still feel this was one of the best hotels we've experienced in Europe. Walter and Sandro were very welcoming and helpful, as were all the staff. We stayed in 2 rooms both of which we're quite small (we had been advised at booking of the size of rooms and that we had to move after 2 nights) but both were equally comfortable, well decorated and very clean. The entry courtyard is very quaint and romantic, the perfect place for breakfast or a late afternoon bottle of wine (or two).The hotel is in my view extremely well placed for Venice. The immediate area is relatively quiet which is delightful after a day of exploring what is a fairly chaotic place even out of season. It is easy walking distance to the Rialto bridge and the bustling fruit and fish markets are not too far away. There are several restaurants  bars within close proximity, but far enough from the tourist catchment. All in all this was a thouroughly enjoyable hotel experience. If you prefer large, impersonal hotels with all the trimmings this may not be for you.

<Content>A home away from home We chose this hotel based on the high praise from previous guests and were not disappointed. The location is easy to find and gives easy access to Venice. There are local restaurants that the management recommended but we found even better value for ourselves. You can walk around the markets, buy your bread, cheese and meats for lunch + a bottle of great wine for less than 20e. We stayed in room 4 and at check in joked about not getting this room due to previous reviews. It looks out over the courtyard on the ground level and I assumed it would be quite noisy but did not have any problems at all. The room itself was big and spotlessly clean with great decor. The family has spent 2 years renovating this house and the marble bathrooms are better than most 5 star hotels. They have left the 14th century beams in place to add to the ambience. A great hotel with friendly staff at fantastic prices. A definite on my next visit to Venice.

It is beautifully decorated and the location is perfect being a slightly quieter area with good restaurants but easy walking distance to Rialto, markets and other sights.The breakfast was simple and good, and served by smiling staff.Walter and Sandro were really lovely and couldn't have been more helpful.We will never forget Venice or this beautiful little Hotel and it's great owners.

<Content>Beautiful oasis of calm We booked our stay last September and travelled with our 3 children, who were 17,15 and 9 years old. We decided to celebrate our Silver Wedding with a trip to Venice as we had visited on our honeymoon and had loved it.We arrived at about 11.15 am after a 6.45 flight from the UK, so were feeling very tired, we were shown straight to our room and had a rest for a couple of hours. The room was beautiful and even though it had a four poster bed and 3 single beds there was plenty of room, we also had a balcony overlooking the courtyard and a hydrotherapy bath, which was lovely for sore feet.We stayed for 5 nights and the staff were lovely and the breakfasts were so good, I still think about those lovely warm apricot croissants.This was such a peaceful and quiet spot, it was brilliant to get back after the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas, but within a few minutes were some lovely restaurants and bars. We ate at La Zucca twice and it was great, I must also recommend Al Nono Risorto where the food was really good and very reasonably priced. On our last evening we went into Campo San Giacomo dell'Orio and sat in the square and had some lovely wine at Al Prosecco, my daughter went to the toilet and when she came out she informed us that this was Emma Thompson's local - lucky Emma Thompson.We had a fabulous stay and I was very sad to come home, I would love to go back and I would love to stay at this beautiful hotel again. Thank you to Valter and Sandro and your lovely staff.

<Content>Best Choice by Far Having just returned from a long weekend in Venice I had to post a review, if only to further emphasise what many have already said.We travelled on our own after booking the break independantly and I have to give top marks for accurate directions that got us smoothly from the airport to the hotel door, Venice I have to say was a little daunting having just stepped off a plane and not knowing the routine shall we say, but it was almost effortless and the first sign of the hotels efficiency.Our room was a suite that had been opted for on booking, very spacious, clean and we had a little balcony overlooking the courtyard.All the staff were pleasant and very helpful, we didn't use their knowledge of the city as much as we could have, choosing instaed to go off and explore at our own leisure, however you got the impression that nothing would be too much trouble should you ask.I would highly reccommend this hotel, it was a welcomed peaceful retreat to return to after facing all the bustling crowds around Venice.All in all a lovely stay but a word of warning - take plenty euro's for eating out, we didn't realise just how expensive the city is!!!

<Content>Truely lovely hotel -- don't miss it! My husband and I loved this hotel! It is located in a quieter, non-tourist area (relatively speaking), which was perfect for us. You can easily reach the Al Ponte by getting off at the San Stae vaporetto stop. You walk 1.5 to 2 blocks and take a left (you鈥檒l see a hotel sign on the building at this turn) and go down the alleyway to the hotel鈥檚 service entrance (back door). By taking this route, you鈥檒l have no steps to climb or bridges to cross, which is particularly helpful when dragging your baggage. Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo has been beautifully restored. In August 2007, we stayed in a double superior room (E145) our first night there (the only room available), decorated in Venetian red. The room was spacious; the bathroom was luxurious; and the beds were very comfortable. Our second night at Al Ponte, we stayed in double room (E130) on first floor room to the right of the desk. My husband and I both loved this room. It was very spacious and quiet and of course, easy to access (no stairs to climb). I loved waking up in the morning to the sounds of fisherman starting their boats outside our window. I knew Venice was waking up. The hotel serves a lovely breakfast outside (weather permitting). It鈥檚 so comfortable and relaxing on their outdoor patio, that it鈥檚 tempting to stay awhile and just enjoy a great cup of coffee. You can access the hotel鈥檚 wireless Internet for a fee, so if being *wired* on your vacation is important 鈥?they鈥檝e got that covered. Do note that the walls in your room are thick, so you may not be able to access the Internet in your room (which was our experience). Instead, you may need to take your laptop to the first floor lobby or patio to surf the web. (I opted to unplug and enjoy our stay in Venice). Walter and all of his staff are lovely people. Clearly, they love their hotel and enjoy helping travelers experience the magic of Venice. The staff was very helpful in providing us directions to our destinations, using Venice鈥檚 3,000 alleys. Walter gave us a small fold-up map which you will find in a basket on the check-in desk, which is priceless. While we had had read that Venice is a tourist city, the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo introduced to us to a lovely side of Venice, full of beauty and charm. The hotel made our stay a joy 鈥?something not to be missed. I鈥檓 thankful for all the TripAdvisor members, who recommended this treasure. I wouldn鈥檛 want to stay anywhere else!

<Content>effortless class Only 3 mins stroll from the scrum of the Rialto, here is another world, calm and still. From the brass bell and massive wrought iron gate that open onto the small courtyard, through to all the details of the public areas and rooms, there is an impression of care and attention which must be down to the personal taste and presiding interest of the owners. Don't expect fawning service or overblown breakfasts - this is a place for adults to be treated as such. We usually check out other hotels in town for future reference - in Venice we just didn't bother.

The owners were wonderfu and helpful, as well as the staff. Our room was beautiful and totally renovated. A beautiful Murano chandelier hung in our wonderful, soundproofed room. Though the room was small for me and my two children, we did not feel cramped, but comfortable and cozy.

<Content>Perfect in every way We had 3 nights here. The rooms were beautifully furnished  spotlessly clean  the staff were all helpful  friendly. The location was surprisingly good, as looking at a map it appears to be quite some distance from the main sights, but the Rialto Bridge is about 10mins stroll  St Mark's Square is another 10 from there. When we checked out, we walked with our luggage to Piazzale Roma to catch the shuttle bus for the airport because the vaporetto(water bus) gets very crowded  it only took us about 15/20mins on foot. All in all, a perfect hotel in a spectacular destination. We WILL be returning.

<Content>A little slice of paradise My husband and I are just back from a week at the Mocenigo. Venice was HEAVING with tourists (well, it was the film festival, not to mention the regatta...) but going back to the Mocenigo at the end of a day's exploring was a real escape. A converted palazzo, it oozes atmosphere and old Venetian charm. BUT - If you want a room with a view, this may not be the place for you. We stayed in two different rooms (mix-up on the booking form which ran over August and into September): the first (Room 4) overlooked the courtyard where the guests breakfasted, making it impossible to open the blinds or the windows without feeling like a goldfish. The second (Room 7) overlooked a side street so close that you could reach over and touch the wall of the house opposite - which we found quite charming, even if it did make the room a bit dark without the lights on! Both rooms were beautifully appointed and maintained to a really high standard. The staff, without exception, were a delight. We woke every morning to the smell of the fresh croissants and bread baking downstairs for our breakfast. There was a stack of umbrellas in the hallway for unexpected downpours (and boy, can it rain in Venice!). It was about as far removed from a Ramada or a Hilton as you can imagine - staying here was like stepping back in time, without losing out on any of the perks of 21st century holidaying. We'll definitely be back.

<Content>Charming Hotel! Very charming small hotel! You enter thru iron gates down into a gorgeous little courtyard where we ate breakfast every morning. Our room was elegant and very spacious and the staff was very friendly. The hotel was a little off the main tourist area, but within 5 minutes you're in the thick of it all. We would definately stay there again! One tip we have is to be prepared to get off the vaporetto as soon as it docks at the stop near the hotel. They opened and closed the gates so quickly that we were forced to get off at the next stop. It was a difficult walk to the hotel with all our luggage!

One of the best things about this place is how close it is to the vaporetto stop - no dragging your luggage half way around Venice like every other poor sole... If you are going to Venice book this place, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Disappointed. This was our second stay at this hotel inless than a year and we won't be returning. It is still a pretty little hotel in a good location and still is a pretty good value for the price. The hotel is clean and well-decorated. Rooms are fairly spacious. The ac does not work really well and the hairdryers are horrible. Toiletries very poor quality. Most importantly, I think they have gotten a little full of themselves. Both owners were a little bit snippy at times and weren't very helpful. Upon arrival whne asked for help with our bags, we were met with grumbling and a comment about how he had just hurt his back and shouldn't be lifting luggage- he let my 63 year old mother carry her large suitcase up the steps while he took a small duffel bag. When I saw what was happening and came to help her, he just stepped aside and watched us carry the bags. On check-out day, he just refused to help. On another occassion, we were treated like criminals when we returned from the beach. We had brought towels from the room and the extra sheet with us. He actually yelled at us and called us rude for using the towels  sheet. We didn't see the harm- we brought them back and they weren't filthy or anything- we had shaken out all the sand. The yelling was unnecessary. Finally, upon check -out the credit card machine wasn't working. After 20 minutes of trying, I said that we had to go or we were going to miss our train and could he use a manual cc imprint. He found the request very annoying and gave me a hard time about it saying I had to stay until he got through to the cc compnay on the phone. In general, I found Walter and Sandro to be sort of cold, rude and arrogant during this stay from the moment we checked in. We'll look elsewhere for our next trip.

<Content>Just what you want from Venice This small hotel is right out of a fairy tale. It has all the charm and warmth one wants from a trip to Venice. The hotel is a fifteen-minute vaparetto ride from the center of the city, so it is away from the crowds of tourists (and in July it was very crowded!) The vaparetto stop, which is off the Grand Canal, is an easy five-minute walk from the hotel. One gets the feeling that you are in a residential section of the city with charming restaurants and shops within a five-minute walk. Breakfast was abundant, fresh and tasty. The hosts were friendly and very helpful. It is a find. Unless you need to be in the middle of the tourist sites, stay here! You won't regret it.

<Content>Perfect Choice My wife and I stayed here after reading all the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor (along with reviews of another 100+ hotels in Venice). The reviews were dead-on as the hotel was perfect for our needs: affordable, well-situated, and very romantic. The owner and staff were quite affable and helpful (we got an outstanding restaurant recommendation from the owner). The breakfast in the courtyard was delicious and the rooms were very nicely decorated and had all the necessary modern amenities. For us, it was wonderful to sit in the courtyard and have a glass (or three) of wine and just enjoy being in Venice while not feeling hassled by all the tourists. We would strongly recommend this hotel and will most certainly stay here again should we return to Venice.

The rooms are rich in colour but you have every emenity you need. They are very clean. You have to remember you are in tight quarters anywhere in Venice. This hotel has a lovely breakfast terrace with wonderful food. You eat and get right on your way. There are no lounge areas here. You can walk everywhere or take the valporetta. Remember to eat at the restaurants off the beaten path. They have wonderful food and 1/4 of the price. If you are looking for sun and beach for a day, go to Lido. It's awesome.

<Content>I get the warm and fuzzies You will not be disapointed. I stayed here just after christmas and Al Ponte Mocinego helped make it an absolutely wonderful experience. The hotel is small, the kind of place where they greet you by name and it feels less like a hotel and more like your'e staying in someone's home (a gorgeously decorated and appointed one at that) and since its tucked away off the beaten track you get a small taste of what venice is really like, small wonderful trattorias down seemingly mundane alley's locals chatting and shopping, you feel like you're the only tourist in the city. I am not exagerating when I say you will not find another hotel like this in venice

Walter and Sandro were gracious hosts and I am still dreaming about our delicious breakfasts in the outdoor courtyard. We stayed in the newly opened annex, just down the alley from the main hotel entrance and it was quiet, well air-conditioned, and the room rivaled any 5 star hotel I have stayed in. The hotel is located about 10-15 minutes walk from St. Marks square, but one minute from the San Stae vaporetto stop. The walk to St. Marks square is very scenic, through the fruit and vegetable market and over the Rialto bridge. This hotel is an absolute gem and I can't recommend it enough.

<Content>A true Venetian treasure Ponte Al Mocenigo is a gorgeous hotel in a very convenient location. The rooms are beautifully decorated, with silk on the walls, italian marble bathrooms and heavy wood furniture. Our room didn't have much of a view, but rather faced a quite genuine narrow venetian alleyway, which I personally found quite charming.I found the location ideal, with a quick and easy vaporetto link within two minutes walk from the hotel to everything we wanted - and besides, everything in Venice is more or less within walking distance wherever you are. (I especially enjoyed the walk to the Rialto market from the hotel.)The air conditioning was very welcome (and efficient), the tv had a few english speaking channels (CNN etc) and the breakfast in the court yard is a lovely way of starting the day with freshly baked (warm) apricot croissants etc. Sandro the owner was very charming and helped us book a restaurant for a special dinner during our stay, which saved me from trying to make myself understood over the telephone in faltering italian....

<Content>The BEST! I spent hours researching hotels throughout Italy, and we were pleased with all my choices. Without doubt, Al Ponte Mocenigo was the most impressive of all our locations. I initially read about it in Rick Steve's Italy. Then I checked TripAdvisor, and that confirmed my choice. At the time, it was listed as #1 in Venice.I loved the quiet location, the beautiful room (we stayed in the annex and looked out at the street below), the great breakfast, and the friendly staff. I could not imagine staying in the midst of the crowds in the heart of the tourist section. I would recommend this hotel without reservation to anyone. I loved Venice and this hotel was one of the reasons!

<Content>Excellent Choice!!! I stayed at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo from July 2 through July 6. It was our first time in Venice and we could not have made a better choice! The room was beautiful - even my 10 year old loved the room. We loved having breakfast in the courtyard every morning. The desk is staffed 24/7 with people who are willing and able to assist you with whatever you need - reservations, advice, ... I traveled alone with my 2 children - ages 16 and 10 and always felt safe and relaxed. Venice is a wonderful city. One of the best things about the hotel is the location - the vaporetto stop is just steps away, but you are so removed from the crowds at San Marco and the Rialto that it is very peaceful. You can contact the hotel directly to book and they will make all of the arrangements through email. They were very helpful with my many questions before I even arrived!I agree with a previous reviewer on several points: try Al Nonno Ristoro for a great meal and you should take the vaporetto to Murano, it really is beautiful. Another restaurant worth a try (and a nice walk) is Al Ponte del Megio - you can sit outside right next to a small canal. Another great restaurant choice: Taverna San Trovaso - near Academia - they actually have two restaurants right near each other, good food and atmosphere.I sincerely hope to return to Venice and when I do, I would not consider staying anywhere other that the Hotel Al Ponte Mecenigo.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I heard of the Al Ponte Mocenigo through trip advisor and I have to agree with virtually everyone else - this is a gem of a hotel. All the rooms are non-smoking and are large and beautifully furnished. The hotel is in an excellent location, only about 30 yards from the Grand Canal and a vaporetto stop. In a nice quiet location but with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby and about 10 minutes walk to the Rialto bridge and another 10 mins to Saint Mark's. The owner and all the staff are very friendly, speak excellent English and are veryhelpful and gave lots of clear, useful advice. I would recommend thishotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, bargain price Like many, we found this hotel on Tripadvisor and booked based on the reviews. The hotel exceeded our expectations. It is an easy trip from the train station, away from the crowds, but close to the sights. The building is several hundred years old but the room--second floor with a balcony, ask for it--was beautiful, antique furnishings but a big, modern bathroom. We found the air conditioning to be good, even during a warmer than usual May. I looked at several other rooms and they were even larger and as nice. The owners are great, very helpful with directions. We ate breakfast in the courtyard every morning which was delightful. I checked around and this was a very good rate for Venice. Considering the quality of the hotel it is a real bargain.

<Content>great location we are 6 adults who spent 4 nights here in june. the location is very good. it is right off the st.stae vaporetto stop. there are two sets of directions given. the easiest way with luggage is to get off by the church. go down the street to the right of the church as you are facing the church. within 100 yards or less you will come to the first alley on the right. there is a sign with the hotels name on the building at the corner about 10 feet high. turn into the alley and the entrance is about 2/3 down the alley to the right. the other way in involves a bridge and steps. the hotel rooms are large , clean and with a large bath room. we had a triple , single and double and everyone was happy with their rooms. the included breakfast is continental but includes warm croissants , cereal, juice (the blood orange is very good) ,hot chocolate and fresh fruit. it is served in a nice little courtyard. the owners are very helpful and recommended three restaurents that we enjoyed. the favorite was on a bridge and called ponte monegio (or something like that) it was by a canal and you could watch the gondollas go right by your table. more important the food was very good and reasonable. one other restarent specialized in non meat dishes (zuccia) and it was very good and reasonable. all three restaurents were close and in local neighborhoods with few tourists.(mostly locals) . the hotel is in a non touristy area and is quiet at night. we saw both murano (great shops and much prettier town than i expected) and burano(very beautiful with all the houses brilliantly painted in bright colors.) both islands ware less crowded that venice and had many shops. go to st marcos at night to see the church and dodges palace. instrumental groups with vocalist compete at different restaurents for customers. music is great as is athmosphere. beware food/drinks are high but great experience even if you just want to walk around. hotel is in good location for water bus and to walk to all of venice. the owners were great price is one of best in town. double 135 euro triple 155 euros single 100 euros. if staying longer than 2 days get 3 day water pass . it includes trip to islands but not to airport. we took bus (30 minutes 2 euros)

<Content>Just as good as everyone says!! I was a bit nervous since I booked this hotel for our family ( 2 adults and a 14  16 year old) completely based upon the reviews on this website. We arrived via private water taxi from a long plane ride. It was a few feet from the Grand Canal. The location is fabulous. The hotel was just as described-spotless and fresh-the inner courtyard was very quaint and we enjoyed a great breakfast there every morning-The hotel is located off St. Mark's Square which we found to be a benefit fto get away from some of the other tourists. A very nice walk to the square through the small shops-lovely- The owners were very helpful and guided us to many local restaurants. I would definitely stay here again - my family really enjoyed this hotel- Trip Advisors reviews were right on the mark! Never mind that the rates were great (and included breakfast). A great deal!

<Content>Excellent Hotel - believe the reviews! Don't let the 2 star rating fool you 鈥?this little gem of a hotel has many of the amenities, atmosphere, client service and location of many 3 and 4 star hotels, at a bargain of a price. We chose this hotel solely on all of the positive reviews we found here on Tripadvisor.com. Here are our observations after our 5 night stay:-The location is excellent, right near the St. Stae vaporeto station and an easy walk to the Rialto Bridge area. We will take quiet over a view any day and the quiet surrounding neighborhood made this a peaceful place to stay.-Our room surpassed our expectations. Nicely furnished in period style, comfortable bed, plenty of storage space and a modern bathroom with a shower with solid water pressure. -Breakfast in the courtyard was fantastic. The quality of the food was excellent; there was a nice variety of cereal, yogurt, fruit, rolls and the apricot filled croissants. Eating in the courtyard was pleasant and we talked to some nice people who were also staying at the hotel. -Walter and Sandro were excellent hosts. Prior to arrival, we had e-mailed a list of restaurants we wanted to try and they arranged reservations at all of them. They were very receptive to our questions and looked up on the various Venice maps some of the more obscure places we wanted to seek out. They were very friendly and helpful with everything we asked them about.All-in-all he positive reviews of Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo were accurate and we highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>The owners of this hotel are of the reasons i loved venice! What a great place to honeymoon! My husband and i wen there in April after our wedding and it was AMAZING! The owners are just SOOO great and friendly, the capaccino was made to order and the Croissants with Nutella were to DIE for! (apricot filled crossants)You can even request Breakfast in Bed!The Owners were SOOOO GREAT about helping us find restaurants and to get good directions- they were really so accomadating.This hotel is a little farther away from st. marks square, which we liked because it seemed to be in a place more for (the few) locals who live there, so we go to see local italian kids at the nearby piazza and really enjoy the slow pace of life. The rooms were clean and we couldn't ask for anything better. I can't believe it was only 2 stars! i bet it would be rated better in the US. THE ONLY complaint i have was that, though they have air conditioning, it was barely blowing cool air! This could be because I am from the south and used to REALLY COLD AC, but it did get hot in my room a few times, and this was in april!But, it may be like that in all of italy- not sure.Anyway, this is a great little place and we told Alejandro we would write about it!

<Content>Delightful Find I booked this hotel after reading the reviews and am so glad I did. It is everything everyone has already written and exceeded our expectations based on our previous experience of hotels in Italy. On the advice of other reviews we took the water taxi from Marco Polo and would not hesitate to repeat the experience if we could afford it. Despite arriving very early, 10.30 a.m., our room was ready so we were able to drop our bags and get out to see Venice. I was a little worried that our room might be noisy as it was right next to reception and to get into the hotel you have to press a buzzer, but we were not disturbed once! The location is terrific - once you get your bearings you can get to the Rialto Bridge in 5 - 10 minutes. Tables were booked for us by Roberto and Sandro at El Refelo, La Zucca and Al Nonno - all were excellent. Breakfast in the courtyard was the best we have ever had in Italy and nothing was too much trouble for the lovely staff. It was very straightforward to wheel our suitcases down the Calle straight onto the vaperetto at San Stae and used the airport shuttle back to the airport - a bargain at 3 euros! If we return to Venice we will not hesitate to return to this hotel.

<Content>Great location in a beautiful city Spent 4 nights at the Al Ponte in April.We stayed in the recently converted annex which is not directly connected to the hotel but it's a minutes walk to the back door entrance. Our only disappointment with the whole stay was the choice of room. We booked early but received the back room on the first floor. This didn't have much natural light making the room gloomy. Rooms are well appointed though and have quality fittings.Location is excellent. As previous reviewers have indicated the ATVO (bus) costs 3 euros to the city bus terminal and from here its an easy 10 minutes on the water bus to the hotel which is 1 minute from the landing point. The hotel is away from the main tourist hordes but is still convenient for all the main sights.Walter and Sando were most helpful giving the lowdown on local restaurants and making reservations on your behalf if asked.Breakfast is lovely. Situated in an old courtyard, which has been beautifully restored. Good choice of the usual breakfast options.The hotel is a super base and aside from the issue with the room would not have hesitated to give this 5 stars.

<Content>Great Hotel Just like everyone else has said, this is a great small hotel. We stayed in the annex - the rooms were very nicely decorated in traditional venetian style and the bathroom was very modern and had a lovely shower.It is located in a quiet area in Venice away from tourists. This was nice as it's less than a 10 minute walk to Rialto and then maybe an extra 5 to St Marks Square. The Vaporetto stop is 30 seconds away which makes this a perfect location...Breakfast is in the courtyard and was very pleasant. Will stay again and would recommend to anyone!!!

<Content>Charming hotel We loved venice and were delighted with this choice of hotel. Its exactly as the website and this does it justice. We had the junior suite with little terrace and this was gorgeous however and this is merely from a personal experience I suffered from back pain as the bed was so hard. Ive been to italy before and I know the mattresses tend to be a little firmer but this was extremely firm however dont let that put you off as this was just my own issue. My husband had good nights sleep on all three of the nights we stayed.Anyway, the jacuzzi bath tended to ease the tired feet and sore back....Very convenient to san stae vaparetto stop and I would strongly advice getting the day tickets we purchased the three day ticket and found this great value for money as we used it all the time hopping on and off just with our map and expectations. We walked from the hotel to st. marks on two occasions and found this fine with map from hotel although we had brought our own streetwise map which we used also. Through rialto but the street main ones are highlighted with arrows directing to bridge etc so we only got lost a few times and this was all part of the great experience. The owners were lovely helpful and courteous and booked la zucca for us just a few mins away from the hotel for dinner on our first night. We arrived at the hotel from airport via water taxi and this is an experience I would highly recommend the taxi brought us straight to canal side entrance and worth every penny.Breakfast in courtyard lovely and buffet cereals, bread tea coffe and juices all very nice to start the day. enjoy your stay.......

<Content>Excellent Hotel! We stayed at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo for 5 nights in June 2007. We highly recommend this outstanding small hotel if one would like an immaculately clean, attractive and well maintained room, in a good location, at a fair price. We had two rooms, the second room due to a late change in our plans.Both superior rooms were large and elegant, had self-controlled air conditioners, and comfortable king sized beds. The bathrooms and showers were spacious and immaculately clean. We had the large 鈥淩ed Room鈥?and for the last night the very large 鈥淕reen Room鈥?with a balcony overlooking the courtyard. The buffet style continental breakfast (cereals, yogurt, fruits, croissants, rolls, soft cheese triangles, jellies, juices, cappuccino, milk, hot chocolate, etc.) is served in the beautiful courtyard. My wife says they have the best cappuccino in Italy. One can鈥檛 help but feel like an old Venetian aristocrat eating in the courtyard. The beautiful flowers and statues made a lovely setting.The hotel is a 1 minute walk from the vaparetto stop. When arriving with luggage, one can avoid carrying the luggage over two canal-staircases by entering through the back door of the hotel. After departing from the vaparetto, walk straight ahead (Salizada San Stae) and take the first street on the left (it looks like a narrow alley). About two-thirds through the street is the side entrance to the hotel.An Internet terminal is available if you request use of one.The owners, Walter and Sandro, as well as the staff, are very nice, extremely knowledgeable, and helpful with sightseeing, restaurants, etc. Great people!We will definitely stay at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo in the future.

<Content>A gem of a hotel... We booked this hotel on the strength of the recommendations and were not dissapointed. It's ideally located just a few stops (15mins) on the waterbus from the bus/train station at Piazzale Roma. It's also worth pointing out that if you're arriving from Treviso airport there is a coach/bus service connected to your flight that brings you to the station in around 45mins for just a few euros. Obtain your ticket for this from the booth inside the airport terminal as you can't pay when you board.It's worth considering a 24 / 48 / 72 hour waterbus ticket (vaporreto) as the convenience of hoping on and off, especially when your feet are tired and weary is well worth it !The hotel itself is extremely well presented and very clean and the personal service from the staff i.e. booking of tickets, restaurants etc together with their tips and advice was very helpful. It's also away from the hustle and bustle of the primary tourist locations and yet only a 15min walk to the Rialto Bridge and around 20 to St Marks Square; even less if you go by vaporaetto.If you want to take the 'secret' tour of the Doge's Palace then do book in advance i.e. a few weeks before you go. At our time of visiting these tickets were sold out around 3 weeks in advance!All in all a great hotel and one that we will book again when we return !

<Content>Great Stay at Al Ponte Mocenigo Based on the reviews we chose to stay at Al Ponte Mocenigo. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We stayed in the New Annex. If you appreciate newly built or newly remodeled hotels, you'll love Al Ponte Mocenigo's new annex. The best part about this hotel is the service. Sandro and Walter are so very helpful it makes your stay spectacular. We also enjoyed that the hotel was a short walk to San Marco square but not dead smack in the middle of all the tourists. We chose to take a bus from the airport to Piazza Roma and then take the Vaparetto (public water bus) from Piazza Roma to San Stae. Al Ponte Mocenigo is about a block from the San Stae water bus stop. Walter gave great restaurant recommendations and directions. The hotel only has about 14 rooms, so book your stay early; it gets sold out quickly. The other great thing about this hotel is the price. The price is very very reasonable compared to the other hotel prices in a high tourist area. The wireless internet signal cannot penetrate throught the solid doors to the hotel room, so you have to bring your laptop to the lobby, or you can borrow a laptop from the front desk. There is a continental breakfast each morning included in the price. It consists mainly of cereal and bread and juice.

<Content>The REAL Venice! My husband and I stayed at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo for two nights in May 2007. We chose this hotel based on the reviews in Trip Advisor, and thought it was great. Our only disappointment was in the location of our room (I think it was room 2), on the lobby level, right outside the kitchen. Since we spent such little time in the room, it wasn't much of a problem. The room was immaculate, and the bathroom was large and modern. Venice was at the beginning of our trip, and after staying here, we thought ALL the bathrooms would be like this one - no way! What we liked the most about this hotel, and what must be stressed is the neighborhood - by staying here, you truly get to feel what it's like to live in Venice. The people were great, and the neighboring restaurants were all fantastic. As everyone else has said... don't hesitate - just book it!

<Content>Great find We chose the hotel after reading other reviews and would certainly stay there again. It was much better than some 4-star hotels we've stayed in. The alley access is definitely the strangest way I've ever entered a hotel, but very interesting!  The only disappointments were that we didn't have a bath tub, the choice at breakfast was a bit limited (though very nice), and personally I go through a lot of coffee first thing so it was a bit of a pain to have to keep asking for refills, but none of these were a big deal. The staff were all really friendly and the rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable. We stayed in the Annexe and having our own entrance door onto the street made us feel like natives, albeit very temporary ones. We got hopelessly lost trying to find our way back from the Rialto on the first night, so I'd recommend keeping a map handy - the charm of being lost wore off after the first hour ... .

<Content>Just book it All we can do is echo what everybody else has said about this wonderful little hotel. Walter and Sandro were perfect hosts, the hotel was spotlessly clean and the breakfast in the courtyard could not have been bettered. The lack of a view did not matter to us at all as we spent all our time out, apart from showering and sleeping. The hotel is no more than 60 seconds from the vaporetto stop which was so convenient after a long day walking. Unless you insist on a view of one of the Venetian landmarks do yourself a big favour and just book it.

We had a small room downstairs right across from the bar and I was worried it would be noisy. it was not.

The breakfast in the courtyard was delightful. Walter and Sandro were very helpful in making recommendations for restaurants and even called to reserve a table for us at a popular restaurant. The neighborhood is out of the major tourist areas, but is still within a comfortable walking distance to all the sights. Many of the bars and restaurants in this area are wonderful because they are local places (i.e. no tourist menus)I highly recommend!

<Content>Lovely small hotel We stayed here in April 2007 for 3 nights. Our room was very nice and fairly quiet. The bathroom was a decent size and spotless.The hotel is pretty small (ten rooms I think) which suited us. It has a very pleasant courtyard where you can have breakfast if the weather's ok. Luckily for us it was warm when we were there.The location is reasonably central - about 5-10 minute walk from the Rialto bridge. It's down a small side street but still very close to the Grand Canal. To be honset I thought it was better staying here than somewhere more central given how busy Venice is. I think we had the best of both worlds - not too far from the main sights but still quiet.There are some good local restaurants nearby which I would recommend rather than going somehwere more on the beaten track. Just ask the staff for recommendations.Overall, I thought it was good value in what is often an expensive city.

<Content>Make a reservation, but with reservations We just returned from our stay at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo. Lovely hotel, lovely area, nice neighborhood piazzas, near the fabulous Zucca restaurant, very helpful Walter and Sandro. Be advised however, that not all rooms look like the pictures on the Trip Advisor Web Site. Some are on the first floor, near reception and breakfast area. Some upstairs (rooms 7 and 8) have a view of a wall. That being said, we did not spend all that much time in the room so were able to overlook small rooms and wall view and concentrate and all the positive aspects of the hotel. Dinner reservations were made, opera reservations were made. There is 1 laptop for customer use, which is nice to keep in touch. We loved the area and would definitely stay there again. Note: ask for discount for cash payment!

<Content>A Great Find! We stayed at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo based on the Trip Advisor reviews and we absolutely enjoyed our stay. The hotel is quiet and quaint and away from the hustle and bustle of of the crowds. Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and immediately made to feel at home. The hotel is also very easy to find. If arriving at Marco Polo airport, exit baggage claim and turn left to purchase tickets for the bus and vaparatto (water bus). You can purchase tickets for both at the fifth window. Take the #5 local bus or the #1 express bus to Venice where you will need to catch a vaparatto to the hotel. Take the #1 vaparatto and go four stops to San Stae. Upon exiting at San Stae, you will see a large church. The hotel is directly behind the church. If our travels ever take us back to Venice, we will definitely stay at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo again!

<Content>Loved this hotel We (middle aged couple) stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in March. We chose this hotel because of the wonderful reviews on tripadvisor. We loved our stay here--it really is as good as people say it is. We contacted the hotel ourselves by e-mail and all our inquiries were answered promptly and professionally. Venice is an expensive city, but we were quite satisfied with the rate we were given and felt we got good value for our money. The hotel is a quick vaporetto ride, or walk to most of the sites. The rooms are beautifully decorated, we had one of the smaller and less expensive rooms right near the breakfast room, but even so, it was roomy, comfortable and very quiet. It even had a small sofa which was a nice plus. The bathroom is completely modern and spotless with thick towels and a towel warmer. A wonderful breakfast is included, that delicious red orange juice, coffee (cappucino, Americano, or Italiano) or tea, warm apricot filled croissants and rolls, jam, fresh fruit, cereal, and biscotti. They have a beautiful courtyard for breakfast in the warm season. All the staff were very helpful and friendly, and spoke English very well. They provided excellent directions for finding the hotel and recommended great restaurants that were nearby and within our budget. The owners patiently answered all my questions and were very gracious hosts. My only regret is that we only had 2 nights! I would gladly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Al Ponte Mocenigo delivers again Yet another happy customer. Stayed here for 4 nights from 22 nd March. Staff extremely friendly, great location just 100 metres from San Stae Vaporatta stop yet very quiet. We stayed in a Superior Double (No 5) Bathroom was lovely, and large bedroom had one view over courtyard the other over small canal. Plumbing and electrics, sometimes dodgy in Hotels all modern and top rate. Only minor issue was bed was on the firm side, but after 2 days and some Italian Pinot Grigo never noticed anymore! Breakfast Continental style but more than enough to set up for day and always served with a smile. Walter and Sando gave excellent recommendations where to eat all within walking distance and will include details in the forum section. We will come back to Venice and will definitely look to stay here again.

<Content>Highly Recommend We stayed one night pre-cruise at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo. We arrived early (9:00 am) to Marco Polo Airport and took the bus for $12 euro to the Piazza Roma. From there, we took the vaporatto to the St. Stea stop (about 3 stops from the Piazza), walked over one bridge and you are there. Lucikly, a nice local couple helped us find the entrance, as the sign is really small.Walter was very welcoming and our room was ready within 15 minutes even though we arrived very early. We stayed on the second floor and had a balcony overlooking the canal. The room was very clean and nice - huge bathroom for Europe. The bed was a bit hard, but still comfortable. The bathroom had a hair dryer for the ladies; however the air was not hot - more warm. I accidently burned the plastic on my curling iron by using an adapter and plugging it into the 220v outlet - so beware women! The 115v outlet works just fine for most small appliances.Be sure to ask Walter for dinner recommendations. We ate at a GREAT place that was not touristy and very affordable. The breakfast and cappicino were great! The seating area is small, so I told the server what I wanted and she brought it up to the room within 5 minutes.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel - it is a great value for the money and I hope to return one day.

<Content>hotel perfection! Spent four days (3 nights) at this hotel for my husband's 70th birthday. I booked flights and hotel direct from the website and having read all the reports on Trip Advisor 's recommendations, was so pleased that everything lived up to expectations. The owners gave us all details of directions to the hotel from Marco Polo airport which were very precise and also directions to the hotel which we found first time!! There is a small alleyway which takes you to the back entrance but it was still worth the squeeze to the back door and, of course, the hotel was only minutes away from the vaporetto bus stop which was a bonus!! We bought a 30 euro ticket at the airport which entitles you to free bus and water bus journeys so we had our money's worth by jumping on the bus daily to experience the views and culture of Venice. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to friends as good value and we hope to return in the not too distant future.

<Content>Loved it! Like most other people who stay here, I booked this hotel due to the fantastic reviews from other Trip Advisor members. With such high expectation levels, disappointment is always in the back of your mind............but not here. Let's not kid anyone, it is only a 2 star, so if you want and need all the trimmings, you're not going to get them. However, for a 2 star, it is quite simply fantastic. Great authentic and immaculate rooms, a beautifully clean and quite spacious bathroom, a lovely little courtyard and the super helpful hoteliers of Walter and Sandro (we were never sure which one was which), who were as good at providing knowledge and recommendations on the city as they were at making you feel comfortable and relaxed. They've made the hotel what it is and have created a real gem.With the vaporetto (water bus) stop only 100 metres from the hotel, it could'nt be more convenient. Al Ponte Mocenigo is tucked away from the main hustle and bustle of the city, which is lovely, yet it's still only a 5 to 10 minute walk from the Rialto and a 15 minute walk to St Marks Square. Check out the fruit and fish market on the way to the Rialto - definitely worth a nose.We paid 90 euros a night (6% discount if you pay cash), for 4 nights at the end of February in a superior double room. Check out the prices of other hotels in Venice and see how Al Ponte Mocenigo compares - it can't be touched!To sum up; a fantastic place to stay in the heart on Venice, where you are superbly looked after, and it won't cost you a fortune.

<Content>so pretty This place is a little hard to find, but then venice is not the easiest place to navigate. the rooms ar beautiful and the owners are very pleasant. the bathrooms are spotless. very impressed. I actually injured myself when I was in Venice and the partner who was present was very nice, helpful and hospitable to myself and my family. this is about 20 min walk from main square. nice place for the price. there are 2 entrances. the one with the gate looks like the back entrance, and the other side is VERY NARROW and ends at a sort of canal. the door is on the side so don't think that it is not there.

<Content>Numero Uno hotel, Reasonably priced  Walter, Sandro and the staff were very friendly. The service was excellent. On the first night we arrived, Walter personally apologized because the room promised to us was still occupied due to the other guest extending their stay. We're given room no.2 behind the reception counter, small but we're still amazed with the interior - very unique, it's like the venetian decor in the old books, but modern. The next morning, Sandro - the other owner, also came to us and apologize for the room booking problem. We felt that they're really sincere. The next day, we got a room with a bath tub, a rare room in venice and probably europe with the same quality. We liked the interior design, furniture and all the details they put in the design (such as the Al Ponte Mocenigo logo on the light switch). Breakfast was plenty. They serve the croissant warm and crispy. This is not done in other hotels where they will just serve without reheating. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay. We'll definitely come back and recommend to friends.

<Content>A super hotel We have just returned after 3 nights at this lovely hotel - booked entirely after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. We most certainly weren't disappointed and this hotel more than lived up to our expectations. We stayed in the junior suite, Room no 10, with a little balcony overlooking the charming little courtyard. The room was very spacious with a huge four posted bed, sitting area and wardrobe and the bathroom too was huge with beautiful fittings and a very powerful shower. Walter and Sandro made us very welcome indeed and it was nice chatting to them during our stay - they are very friendly and very helfpul. As previous reviewers have commented, the breakfasts were lovely and the smell of warm croissants and coffee in the mornings were so yummy! My only negative comment would be that the bed was very firm and the pillows too but that is just personal and everyone is different. The room was spotlessly clean and toiletries were provided in the bathroom which was a nice touch.We found the hotel easy to find on arrival at Marco Polo - once through the baggage hall turn left in the arrival halls and you will see the ticket windows on the left hand side - we bought tickets for the blue ATVO bus at Euro 3 to Piazzale Roma - leave the terminal building and the bus stop is just outside on the right -you can even buy tickets from a machine there and from the bus conductor - make sure you validate them in the little yellow box before getting on the bus. The journey takes about 20 mins to the bus station. There is was a little more confusing as either we missed the signs or there weren't any! Anyway, make your way to the left of the bus station area and there are some ticket offices. We bought tickets for the no 1 vaporetto at Euro 6 each. Make your way from the ticket office to the right, over a little bridge and down onto the canal front. The stop for no 1 is to the left. Once at San Stae the hotel is just 30 metres from the stop and the directions provided by the hotel were very accurate. We enjoyed being in a quiet part of town after all the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas at Rialto Bridge and St Marks Square. The hotel is very conveniently located for walking to the bridge, about 10 minutes looking at the shops along the way! On Sunday everywhere was just heaving with tourists and it was quite a fight to find our way through them over the bridge and into St Marks Square. It was just wonderful though to see so many in costume for the carnival and the atmosphere was so happy - those dressed up were only too willing to be photographed and were terribly patient with all the tourists. Just fascinating to sit and watch them in St Marks Square. There are coffee shops all over the place with varying prices for a cappuccino - necessary stops for a toilet too at times!We had a nice pizza one lunchtime at Il Nono which is very close to the hotel and one evening had a delicious meal at Bistrot de Venise - pretty expensive but excellent food with a very comprehensive menu and we really enjoyed it. We ate a couple of times at restaurants on the canal by the Rialto Bridge - the food was Ok, the service very good but we felt they catered just for the tourists which is hardly surprising.As my husband wasn't well when we came to leave, we splashed out on a water taxi from the San Stae stop back to the airport at a fixed cost of Euros 90 - well worth it and something totally different - it took 20 minutes but there is quite a long walk from the boat to the terminal building.All in all we had a really lovely time and cannot recommend this little gem of a hotel more highly. It is hardly surprising that it is always fully booked.

<Content>A great place to stay to experience real Venice The Hotel is a lovely find. We booked here because of the No.1 rating on Trip Advisor for hotels in Venice and the pictures. Being a same-sex couple we are naturally apprehensive about how welcoming small family run places will be, however the owners were really friendly, chatty and conversational and made a real effort to make us, and all the other guests feel totally at home. The lady serving breakfast is delightful - so attentive and again, very friendly, not to mention the quality  choice, second to none. We stayed in room number 2 on the ground floor, behind reception. The room is small, but so is everything in Venice. The quality of the fittings and attention to detail is amazing and so clean you could swear it was all brand new. The only problem was that the bed was too firm for us and we didn鈥檛 sleep well because of this, not really the hotels fault as everyone has different preferences. The night watch man was very friendly, even when we were last in gone midnight, we didn鈥檛 feel we had to be in early or anything. Venice itself was fantastic, carnival is a good time to go as there are lots of street performers and people wearing traditional costume / masks - it鈥檚 like stepping back in time. The water buses are frequent and run 24 hours and very cheap if you buy a 1, 2 or 3 day pass which covers the land bus to Marco Polo Airport too. If we were coming back, we would stay here again for sure, but would pay more for a larger room perhaps.

<Content>great place, fine location My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights in May 2006. Our room and bathroom were very nice, and spotlessly clean, though some Americans may have considered them small. We met only one of the hotel's owners, and had a very good impression of him. Frankly, all of the favorable comments in these reviews seem well-founded. My only addition is that the hotel is a short (and picturesque) walk to the vaparetto station. (A vaparetto is Venice's equivalent of a city bus.) The vaparetto is cheap, fun, and easy to use, even if you don't speak Italian, but watch the signs so that you don't miss your stop. The vaparetto can take you to Saint Mark's Square, to the Gritti Palace for a super-expensive dinner, or anyplace else in Venice. In short, Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is terrific.

<Content>The reviews win out! I cannot praise this hotel enough. It fulfilled all our expectations through other reviews. We had 4 nights in the Junior suite, which was lovely. The breakfasts were great; the senora made excellent coffee. Walter  Sandro helped out in every way possible - we even managed to get into La Zucca, which was excellent.The only negative I can possibly think of is that there is a lady who lives above that room who had a liking for walking on her floor in high heels early in the morning  all we could hear was clip-clop above us.Good news for fans of this hotel is that Walter  Sandro are extending (must be in another building) so there will be more rooms available. We didn't have a problem with the night watchman - he was OK.We did have a dreadful meal on our last night at a nearby pizza joint out the back way (some name like Tre Archi) in an alley off the Campo San Giacamo dell'Orio.

<Content>If you get the right room this is a gem Having done my research I was delighted to be able to book 2 rooms for the weekend of 26 January 07. We arrived at Treviso Airport at 8.40 pm and reached the hotel by 9.45 pm without difficulty.The hotel location is excellent. It is near to the Vaporetta stop and within near walking distance to Rialto. We had rooms 5 and 8 which were excellent,warm,spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. Sandro and Walter take great pride in their hotel and go to every effort to make their guest feel welcome.They were happy to make restaurant reservations for us and to share their knowledge with us.They certainly added to our very enjoyable weekend.I have no reservations in recommending this hotel and I will look forward to returning.

A little bridge leads over a canal to the hotel which is really cute. it is also max. a 10 minute meander to the Rialto bridge, loads of good eateries and bars nearby. V. handy for the vaporetto stop also, literally 100m away! Really friendly service and would highly, highly recommend.

<Content>Didn't want to leave! I always check Trip Advisor before I book any hotel so when I read the glowing reports of this hotel from my fellow Trip Advisees I booked it without a second thought. We stayed here just before Christmas (a great time to visit Venice) and had a really fantastic time. This was our fourth trip to Venice. The hotel was lovely. We arrived quite late and Giovanni was very welcoming and helpful. We didn't think we would be able to get dinner anywhere as it was late on Sunday night but Giovanni booked a table for us at a nearby restaurant: Al Nono Risorto (best pizzas in town and great value). We went back there several times. The hotel room on the first floor was beautiful, high beamed ceilings and a view of the little canal at the front. ALL the staff were so friendly and helpful. Walter and Sandro went out of their way to try and get tickets for us to a concert in St. Marks Bascilica. Unfortunately they were not able to get them (invitation only) but they tried really hard. When our 5 nights came to an end I just didn't want to leave, I felt so at home.

<Content>A real gem! This small hotel exceeded our expectations. The owner is on site every day and is personable and very helpful. Our room was lovely with a tiny balcony overlooking a narrow canal. Room was also large and nicely decorated. The only drawback in the bathroom is the narrow panel that serves as a shower curtain and is not adequate to contain spray from taking a shower. The bathroom was quite large and very new. We were there in December so the weather was chilly, otherwise the outdoor courtyard would have been very nice. The tiny eating area just adjacent to the front desk does not really offer enough space for all hotel guests so some mornings we ate in shifts. The staff is so nice and the cappuccino so wonderful, that nobody seemed to mind. The owner also has plans for expanding this public area of the hotel and we can't wait to go back to see the results.The location couldn't have been more convenient and directions for entering from the back door were helpful and easy to follow. It is a VERY short walk from the Vaporetto stop. It's in a very quiet area of Venice which we greatly appreciated, even during the low season (still many, many tourists). We'd stay here again in a heart beat!

<Content>Excellent service with a personal touch This was the first place we stayed in Italy, and it was a lovely place with warm friendly people, wonderful service, and beautiful accomodations. The rooms were spacious, well appointed, and spotless, an excellent value for the money. I still get cravings for the breakfast. While being less extensive than usual hotel breakfasts in the U.S., every item was excellent, instead of having more of mediocre offerings like most US hotels. The staff were helpful and friendly, and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time, they even upgraded our room for two nights at no cost. I don't know what the previous reviewer's complaint was with the night watchman, he couldn't have been more friendly to us. I will be back to Venice, and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.

<Content>Must Stay Here! Believe what you read! Don't hesitate to book here. I couldn't wait to get home to write a wonderful review about this quaint hotel with services rivalling 5 star qualities. Since they have FREE internet access, I'm able to write this review. Even if you do not have your own computer, they (Walter, one of the owners and his staff) are happy to supply you with their laptop. The breakfast was more than sufficent, the first breakfast in Italy that actually made me full! (And we've been in Italy for over two weeks already.) The pictures are accurrate, and it could be hard to find if you miss the little sign when you exit the vaporetto, but that is part of the fun. Have a good spirit when looking for the VERY narrow street to the back door. The bathroom is very nice. The bed was comfortable. The shower was big..for european standards. The toilet paper is even soft! And everything is super clean. The staff is the most accomodating and helpful. Truly the BEST place to stay in all of Italy. It looks far from everything on the map, but we wandered the streets and managed to wander right into The Rialto Bridge and even to St. Mark's square in very little time. We really wish we could have stayed longer. I LOVE this hotel!

<Content>A little bit disappointed I must say we were a little disappointed with our trip to this hotel. We have just returned from a three night stay in Venice and they were only able to squeeze us in on our last night. The other two nights we stayed at the Residence Corte Grimaldi (currently no. 3 on tripadvisor!) and that was far, far superior for both quality and location.I was very excited about coming to this hotel having read all the reviews on the website. However, after having a whole apartment to ourselves at the Grimaldi with two bathrooms, a wonderful picturesque balcony and a huge bedroom - we were so disappointed to get such a tiny room at the Al Ponte Mochenigo. We stayed in Room 7 which had a great, clean bathroom and nice furnishings but it felt very dark and dingy. Our room overlooked the alley outside and you could almost touch the buildings opposite. We were also woken by workmen at 8am apparently working in the alley. That said, the breakfast was fine, the staff were friendly and the whole place was very clean. I did manage to see inside one or two of the other bedrooms and they looked lovely. So I guess we were just unlucky with the room.

<Content>An exquisite gem Having booked a trip to Venice for a rather fastidious (yet handsome ) boyfriend, who has a reputation of saying upon arrival to each and every (4*)hotel room DON'T UNPACK. I was relived when, on the occasion we entered our room at (2*) HOTEL AL MOCENIGO, his comments were WOW how wonderful. Previously when on holiday at other destinations, I have wondered passed other hotels and wished i was staying there instead. Whilst in Venice however, I did not wish I was anywhere other than AL PONTE MOCENIGO.Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is truly wonderful. The service is impeccable. The staff are all fantastic, helpful and above all friendly.If you ever get the opportunity to visit Venice, please make every effort to stay at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo - if you do, then try to arrive, as we did by water taxi, which was absolute fun (although a little expensive)!There are so many sights to be seen, museums to visit, and restaurants to dine at and at the end of each day you can look forward to returning to your temporary home (from home), Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo.Thank you Walter and Sandro. Your wonderful night staff and household staff are a credit to you and your hotel.Bravo! Arriverderci. Tanja

<Content>Beautiful hotel Stayed at this lovely hotel from 11-28-12-1, and had a great time. The owners Walter and Sandro were very kind and very patient giving us the best directions, recommending good and reasonably priced restaurants and helping us with other things that happened to arise. Elizabetta, our guide was terrific, and showed us what were the most beautful sights in this lovely city. I especially enjoyed the cathedral and the lighting on the inside. Stay away from the restaurants around St. Marks Square, had quite a pricey lunch, should have realized not to eat around the square. Harry's Bar was fun, enjoyed a peach bellini. Dinner at Trattoria al Ponte, was great, say hi to Millie, the owner's wife from Barb, Barb, and Anne for us, She was very kind, and serves a great meal. Overall, our experience in Venice was wonderful and our time at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo was super!

<Content>Amazing! I can only add to all the positive reviews already given for the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo. We stayed for 2 nights in a standard room on the ground floor. It was beautifully decorated, quiet and the bathrooms were modern and very clean. Breakfast was very good - warm apricot croissants, rolls, cereal, yoghurt, juice and fantastic coffee. Service was outstanding - Walter and Sandro were really friendly, recommended great restaurants and gave good advice on everything else (quickest walking routes etc). The location is also very good - about 5 minutes walk from Rialto Bridge but the surrounding streets are also great for a wander. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, it really is as good as the reviews suggest and the value (鈧?0 a night) is outstanding.

<Content>loved it! We booked this hotel based upon other Trip Advisor reviews and loved it. As everyone has said, the hotel is charming, the owners (Walter and Sandro) are SOOO helpful, and the price is an extraordinary value!Details:1. arrival - we took the #5 city bus from the airport and then the #1 vaparetto right to the hotel - took 1/2 hour total. This is all explained on the directions section on the hotel web site - very easy and there are even signs posted for the hotel once you get off the vaparetto so you can't get lost.2. vaparetto - buy a value pass for 1 day or 3 or how ever long you are staying, as it gets expensive! We bought the orange venice card and got into lots of museums, churches, the casino and all the vaparetto rides we could use for 3 days.3. hotel - our room (10) was gorgeous and immaculate! You can hear footstep noise from room above (no carpets on these traditional Venetian floors!), as well as the downstairs buzzer, but we did not find it too disturbing. Bathroom was also great - very clear and modern. A little terrace overlooking the courtyard was charming!4. breakfast - warm rolls, fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee, cereals...all served in the little side lobby - delicious!5. the area - the hotel is in a charming residential area and so convenient to the vaparetto - a great combo! You'll get lost a little, but that is part of the fun!6. little extras - free use of lap top, no charge for a one-time soda from the minibar or to use the phone for an 800 call, guidebooks all around the hotel to borrow, and wonderful advice both pre-trip and during the trip from Walter and Sandro - thank you both so much!!7. recommendations - bellinis at Harry's bar - expensive but really fun; a visit to St Giorgio Maggiore Island - really cool and a great view from the tower for only 3 euros; dinner at Fischerreria Toscana (sp?) off Rialto - great food!; souvenier glass- reasonable and so prettyl; Frari Church - great art in its original setting; and the Doge's Palace for history! Worth skipping are the modern museum (Ca Pesaro right near the hotel) and the Correr Museum.The city is small and you can really see most everything in 2-3 days if you stay on the main island. We had a vaparetto strike one day and walked everywhere with no problem.We would definitely return!!

<Content>Add honesty to all the other great things about this gem! We only had one night in Venice on November 20, 2006 due to flight schedule after a cruise. We chose this lovely hotel because of all the rave reviews written on this site. We were definitely not disappointed. We agree with all the other comments, plus we have an additional plus to add. I received an email from Walter and Sandro the day after I arrived home letting me know that the cleaning ladies had found my credit card and that it was now in the hotel safe awaiting my instructions. I hadn't even missed my card yet! So, in addition to charm, cleanliness,location, etc., add honesty of the owners and staff. If given the opportunity, we will gladly return to this gem!

<Content>So glad Tripadvisor pointed us to this special place We stayed in this hotel Nov. 20-22 and enjoyed every aspect. It is located in a mostly local-occupied neighborhood. We spent hours wandering the beautiful passages in the surrounding area. Our family of 7 occupied rooms #5, #6, #7 which were located together at one end of the second floor. That provided enough privacy that we did not have to worry about our children disturbing the other guests. I would most highly recommend Al Ponte. It is small enough that one feels as though they have a personal connection to the staff and other guests. Every detail is perfectly planned and presented.

<Content>Excellent service and situation We thoroughly enjoyed our five days here. The hotel is extremely conveniently situated and offers tremendous value for money. Our room was great, with a lovely bathroom and exciting bits of technology like a key that shuts the lights off as you leave your room. Pluses are the excellent atmosphere and service from both owners and staff; small minuses were that our room was too hot and the breakfast fairly basic. But this is a splendid place to stay.

<Content>As good as all of the reviews! I recently stayed for four nights at this hotel, entirely on the recommendations of tripadvisor reviews. I booked a standard double on the ground floor of the hotel (I think there are about four rooms on this floor). The room itself was quite spacious (room for a desk, dresser, full couch, and large queen bed with headboard canopy) and well-decorated; the bathroom extremely large for European standards. Water pressure and temperature in the shower (no bath) was perfect. Oddly, my bed (two twin mattresses pushed together in traditional style) was a bit uneven. Luckily, I was on my own and could choose which firmness I preferred! A warning about the ground floor rooms - you are right off of the main lobby, near the back door (which allows guests in via an audible buzzer), and next to the tiny breakfast area. My room (#3) was just outside the breakfast nook; in the mornings you could hear the occasional clank of china and silverware and loudly chatting guests. (This didn't bother me, since I was awake and up by 07.30/08.00 when breakfast preparations began, but don't book any of these rooms if you're a light sleeper.)My particular room also did not have much sunlight, which did not bother me as I spent all daylight hours sightseeing. They do have, I believe, upper rooms overlooking the canal.(Definitely book well ahead of time, even in the off-season).As promised by all other reviewers, the hotel is charming with a great location in Santa Croce. It is less than a minute's walk to the San Stae vaporetto stop, which is serviced by the #1ACTV vaporetto (also the N service at night). (A note to first-time visitors: the #1 zigzags to stops on both sides of the canal which makes it extremely useful!). With all of the walking you will be doing, the hotel's courtyard is a nice quiet place to seek refuge and read up on your next bit of sightseeing or to write postcards.Another bonus of the hotel's location is how QUIET it is in the evenings and the mornings. I did not hear any delivery boats or working boats going up and down the small canal by the hotel. (Many other sestieres had boats zooming up and down with deliveries starting 06.00 in the morning.)The hotel breakfast service is from 8.00-10.00 which, although limited, is an easy way to get a quick coffee, pastries (very good and large brioches), cereals, biscuits, yogurts, and fruit (these are less than impressive - perhaps the time of year). The rooms also did provide a small mini-fridge stocked with water and soft drinks at very reasonable prices. Both Walter and Sandro (as well as the nightdesk man, Giancarlo) were friendly, helpful, and patient .The value was unbelievable (e90/nt for single guest), especially off-season. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable, warm and friendly, hassle-free stay.

<Content>Hidden Gem !!! What a hidden gem! My mother and I only stayed one night in Venice at Al Ponte Mocenigo, but it was memorable.Walter and Sandro are outstanding hosts. The room was charming and comfortable, and the staff so welcoming and considerate. Most importantly, both the bedroom and bathroom were extremely clean.And the location was wonderful! Although the hotel is a bit further from Piazza San Marco, it's easy walking distance to Rialto Bridge and Market, and another 15-20 min walk to the square. The location was my main concern, but I was so pleased to be off the beaten tourist track, where the city becomes more affordable and less noisy.We look forward to returning to Al Ponte Mocenigo again and again!

<Content>Great Small and Friendly Hotel in Venice I am just back from a long weekend in Venice, having finally managed to get sufficiently organised to take my Mum after years of thinking about it.I was looking for a small, quiet, friendly hotel and I found it in the Al Ponte Mocenigo. The hotel is nothing too flashy, but at the same time a very pleasant. We took what I think was one of the smaller twin rooms on the ground floor. The room was very nicely decorated and the bathroom immaculate - my impression was that the place has been recently renovated by the quality and condition of the fixtures and fittings.The staff are extremely freindly and helpful - they went out of their way to book restaurants, provide directions, and generally answer any query we had - most impressive!The hotel does not serve evening meals (at least it did not whilst we were there). Breakfast is a continental affair (cereal, breads, fruit, yoghurt, etc) and weather permitting, this can be taken in a the outdoor courtyard, otherwise there is a small indoor area by reception. I think there is also the option of having it in your room.In terms of location, it is literally a minutes walk from the San Stae water bus stop and about 10 minutes walk to Rialto. Nearby there are a number of good restaurants, cheaper than those close to the main attractions. We went with the hotels recommendations are were not dissapoionted.The only negative comment I have is that staying in the ground floor room, you do tend to here people arriving back at the hotel at night. There is a door buzzer which is audible from the room, and then the inevitable chatter before folk retire. This did not overly concern me, but if you are sensitive to noise then perhaps you should avoid this room.

<Content>Wonderful Neighborhood Hotel Stayed here for 2 nights after a 14 day Medeterranean Crusie, what a wonderful respite before our long jouney home. We had 2 rooms on the bottom floor and it was perfect for my elderly mother, who has trouble with stairs, and our 15 pieces of luggage! It's located in a great neighborhood with many good restaurants within walking distance. Close to Rialto Market and Rialto Bridge and right off the Vapretto stop. I can not say enough about Walter and Sandro and their wonderful hospitality. It was raining when we arrived and although it is very convenient to use the Vapretto, we took a water taxi right up to the front door off the Canal and Sandro put a foot bridge down and took off all our luggage and then helped us across. It was quite a feat! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful We stayed for only two nights September 11th and 12th, which wasn't long enough. Venice was magnificent and the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo was just the perfect place to stay. It was close enough to everything; only a five minute stroll from the Rialto Bridge, and about ten minutes by vaporetto to St. Marks Square. It was situated in a quiet neighbourhood which gave you the opportunity to see the real Venice.The two gentlemen who run the Hotel were very helpful and endeavoured to do whatever they could to make our stay a pleasant one. Breakfast was enjoyable and served in a beautiful courtyard. A perfect way to begin the day.We can't recommend it enough.

<Content>Fabulous We stayed here for four nights at the end of July 2006. This is a small bed and breakfast and in the warm weather, the large breakfast is served outside. It is away from St. Mark's Square which is what we wanted - and very near a vaporetto stop.The 2 fellows that manage the hotel had great suggestions for dinner and we were not dissappointed. We stayed in the large bedroom with the canopy bed that is illustrated on the website. The bathroom was new, roomy, spotless, and functional. Phones were a bit troublesome but we figured it out. They have a computer you can borrow for short periods to check email etc. Can't go wrong here.

<Content>The spirit of Venice We've been to Venice three times now and this is the best hotel we've stayed in - and it's also in one of the most delightful and buzzy 'real' areas of Venice - a little away from the tourist traps and so much more charming because of that (but there are still some great bars, restaurants and shops). The hotel is lovely - we had the junior suite and it was truly beautiful. Silk lined walls, stunning four poster and furniture, spa bath (and the toiletries handily included bath fizzers for bath fanatic me!), and a tiny but delightful balcony overlooking the pretty little courtyard where breakfast (gorgeous apricot croissants and really frothy cappucino) is taken. The owners, Walter and Sondro, and indeed all of the staff we met, were consideration and charm personified. One morning my husband was 'blessed' by a pigeon whilst we were breakfasting, to my huge amusement of course, but it was almost as though the owners felt responsible, they were so concerned about his shirt! They also gave us some brilliant restaurant recommendations - if it's nice enough to eat outside, definitely try Trattoria Al Ponte del Megio which is quite close by, the staff were so friendly and the food delicious. Also scrummy fritto misto of fish and great service too at Vecio Fritilin. General 'secret' for those who've not been to Venice before (or even those who have) - try to get hold of a copy of 'Chow Venice' (I got mine from Amazon a couple of years ago): it's really handy for finding really special eating places where the Venetians go themselves, and where the food is fabulous and not necessarily 'arm and a leg' prices.

<Content>Hidden secret! My friend and I recently stayed at this quaint, yet chic, hotel off the beaten path in Venice. The crowds were unbelieveable around San Marco, but this boutique hotel, only a few vaporetto stops away, was in a quiet neighborhood with excellent restaurants within walking distance. It's located on a quiet street just a few steps away from the S. Stae stop which made finding it very easy...especially with luggage in tow. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We found the enchanted courtyard a wonderful place to start the day with a light breakfast and ending the day with a bottle of wine. The rooms are FABULOUS! They were the largest we stayed in during our trip, and the bathrooms are INCREDIBLE! The decor of the rooms is in traditional Venetian style with silk fabric on the walls, gilded mirrors and comfortable beds and chairs. The marble bathrooms were very large, clean and modern. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and will stay there everytime I visit Venice. You will be missing out on warm, helpful hospitality in a beautiful, quiet hotel if you don't stay there, too!

<Content>Excellent stay My wife and I absolutely loved this hotel and the service. The owners Walter and Sandro were excellent hosts and really helpful. This was part of our honeymoon stay and everything we read about the reviews is true. The rooms are spacious, clean, and charming. The value for the money can't be beat in Venice and not to mention the location which is tucked away in the heart of a more residential area yet so close to the busy tourist sights and squares. Breakfast was also as good and delightful as we read about. Thank you Walter and Sandro and we look forward to staying with again if we are lucky enough to travel to Venice on another trip.Ari and Michaela

<Content>Wish we had longer Only having one night in Venice we took seriously the reviews posted on this website. We were not dissappointed! The rooms are spacious and quiet. We arrived at about 10am in the morning and had to leave at 6am the next morning but were made to feel more than welcome by our hosts. The hotel is within walking distance of most of the major sites and has a ferry stop right outside the back door if you are not feeling overly energetic. If we had stayed longer and were able to sample the breakfast we had paid for but left too early to enjoy I am sure we would have rated our stay as excellent but only being there a short time I want to maintain the integrity of this site so give it above average with a strong recommendation to others that if you are looking for a well priced, comfortable and welcoming hotel in Venice - You won't be dissappointed here!

<Content>Fantastic !!!!! We have just returned from a short stay at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such hospitality before by the owners, Walter and Sandro. The hotel itself is small (only 10 rooms) and surprisingly has a rating of only a 2 * but the rooms are more on par of a 4 * establishment. I am sure this will change in the future, as it is well deserved. Breakfast in the morning in the courtyard is a must, and was a lovely start to each day. All the staff on the front desk are extremely knowledgeable and were very helpful in recommending some fantastic restaurants and the journey back via the waterbus and bus was made easy as Sandro found out the times of both which made the return journey stress free. A little tip, take a water taxi from the airport to the hotel (drop off is near the San Stae vaporetto stop) it was a lovely way to arrive, its quite expensive (around 80 euros), but well worth the expense !!!We will definately be returning in the near future !!

<Content>Deserves and will soon have 4 stars - don't miss the opportunity! I found this hotel with the help of TripAdvisor and Venere(--). Reviews indicated that this 2 star hotel (price) is a 4 star experience. The rooms are spacious and well appointed with everything a traveler needs; comfortable beds, excellent linens, airconditioning, etc. The service is personal - you feel like a guest in Walter's house. The breakfast is VERY nice with fresh fruit and juice and nice choice of croissants and cereal and excellent coffee. The highlight of the experience is the setting - behind Chisea San Stae (where the vaporetto stops), down a fun alley (well signed), press the door bell and enter a beautiful palazzo with marble floors, statuary, and art with a canal front entrance and bridge front (note: al ponte) entrance.

Sandro  Walter were both warm, welcoming and eager to help...from making reservations for us to helping us lug around our overpacked luggage. We had a beautiful room with 14 ft ceilings which overlooked a canal with a little terrace. The bathroom was a good size, newly redone and spotless. Morning breakfast was served in their private courtyard each day. The location was perfect as well with only a 5 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge.

<Content>A great respite in Venice Within a few yards of the San Stae Vaparetto Stop and a 5 minute walk from the Rialto bridge. Welcomed by one of the two owner business partners, Sandro or Walter, this was a lovely hotel in a perfect location. Breakfast in the courtyard from 8:00-10:00 was bountiful with Fresh rolls and croissants, fresh whole fruit, cheese, juices, and cereals with coffee and a smile was perfect. The staff spoke english and were most helpful and knowledgable on Venice. Worthy of more stars!!! Suggest you get up early and walk 4 minutes to the fresh fish and produce market between 7:30 and 9:00am.

<Content>Pay no attention to the 2-star rating This small hotel is exactly what we wanted in Venice: out of the main tourist areas, in a more residential area, but still only 15 minutes walk to San Marco. We stayed in #10, which was palatially huge, with a four-poster bed, a marble-tiled bathroom with whirlpool tub, and a little balcony overlooking the courtyard. The floor has a bit of a slope to it, but the building IS a few hundred years old, so it's understrandable.We were fortunate enough to be able to enjoy breakfast in the courtyard each of the three days we stayed there, but they'll deliver breakfast to your room if the weather's less pleasant.The area is very charming, and off the normal tourist track. It's only 3-4 vaporetto stops from Piazzale Roma or the train station (yes, you can roll luggage onto the vapo), and about 1 minute from the S. Stae stop. And if you take the back way in (clear directions on the website) you won't have to haul bags over any bridges. The neighborhood is mostly residential (al least by Venetian standards), so you actually stand a chance of hearing some Italian spoken in the nearby restaurants.The area immediately across the canal from here (Canareggio) is also worth checking out. I'd recommend Alla Vedova (in a small alley across the Strada Nuova from the S. Marcuola vapo stop) for some pre-meal cichetti, and nearby Vini da Giorgio for a great meal at reasonable(ish) prices and an excellent wine list.

<Content>A Venetian Gem My husband and I can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and the two young men who run it. We arrived from Toronto on a rainy afternoon, after spending too many hours dealing with late flights, missed connections, lost luggage and an argument with the water taxi operator who refused to take us directly to the hotel's water gate, although we gave him printed instructions and 90 Euros to do so. We must have looked like two drowned rats when we appeared at the front entrance after dragging our luggage over two little bridges. (We had arranged in advance for the water taxi because after four days in Venice we were going on a cruise which required many different types of clothing, and even with one lost suitcase, we still had way too much luggage to carry in Venice) On arrival, we were met by Sandro who instantly had our luggage in our room, a glass of wine in our hands, a dinner reservation made and a promise to deal with the airline over our missing suitcase.The room was large, elegantly furnished and immaculately clean. The bathroom was wonderful with beautiful marble tiles and very modern fixtures. The hotel is exactly as pictured on the website. The courtyard is a great place to start your day, and the breakfast is good with lots of fresh fruit available. Walter and Sandro could not have been more helpful. One or both was always in attendance during the day.Our weather improved dramatically after the first day, and we had a wonderful time exploring the city. The hotel is locatated within a stones throw of the Vaparetto stop, and close to many fine restaurants. On our departure, Walter and Sandro arranged for a water taxi to arrive at their water door, and take us directly to the cruise ship.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and I hope that I can go back again in the near future.

<Content>This is the best hotel you will find in Venice I can only hope that when I am fortunate to find myself in Venice again, I will be lucky to stay at this hotel again! Seems like from the reviews that the word is definately out and everyone knows about it. I am happy for the wonderful owners Saundro and Walter because they are nice, helpful and much deserving of success, but worried that it may mean booking a room here difficult to come by! The rooms are gorgeous, decorated in gilded, glamorous Venetian style of bold colors, Murano glass chandeliers, fabric walls. We had the red triple superior room for 2 nights and it was huge. After some of the smaller rooms we had stayed in Italy, this felt outright decadent! Our last night was in the green superior double room, also wonderfully decorated, smaller but with a great balcony overlooking a canal. Breakfast as reported has great Cappucino, delicious Croissants with melted marmalade inside, all served in a soothing and lovely courtyard. Literally just steps from S. Stae Vaparetto stop (at the stop, go forward about 50 ft. and take the 1st alley on the left - very narrow alley - about 1/2 way down is a buzzer for the hotel and that lets you in the back way which is very helpful with luggage), a blessing not having to go far for one, to find the hotel, and two, for not having to travel around Venice with your luggage. 5 minute walk to the Rialto bridge and 5 more minutes (unless like me you are doing some serious window shopping) to Piazza San Marco. We had an itinerary that we stuck to more or less for our trip to Italy but when we got to Venice, it was thrown out and we just wandered and did what inspired us. We missed going to Murano and Borano and seeing the Accedemia and I hope to do that when we return but honestly Venice is so magical, you can spend your entire time, as we did, just wandering and not be disappointed. And definately splurge on the gondola ride. All I can say is it is worth every penny.

<Content>A special place What a great place to stay in Venice. Just a 7 minute walk to the Rialto bridge, yet far removed from the crowds of tourists throughout Venice. This is a delightful small hotel, almost like a b  b, with a lovely garden, where, in nice weather, you can have breakfast, or relax with a glass of wine after a day of sightseeing. This is an oasis of calm and comfort away from the hustle and bustle of Venice. It is also a short walk (10-15 min) from the St, Lucia train station and a few steps from the vaporetto stop. We walked everywhere during our 5 day stay in Venice. There were a number of lovely restaurants in the area (including a Michelin 1 star). The owners, Valter and Sandro, were particularly helpful in suggesting activities and restaurants. Our room which overlooked the canal, was very comfortable and quiet. I highly recommend Al Ponte Mocenigo and wouldn't hesitate so stay there again.

<Content>#1 Best Small Hotel in Venice Forget the rest. This is the secret gem in Venice, and based on the growing list of raves, the word is out. This is a great small hotel with big, beautiful rooms filled with character and taste, very large, spotless and modern bathrooms, all the amenities of a four star hotel, including mini bar, a courtyard on a canal and two charming hosts to help with anything you need. Right on the St. Stae Vaporetto stop 100 feet away down the main street there is a tiny alley with signs leading you to the hotel. Don't let that entrance bother you. It's the back way, but at least you don't have to drag your suitcases up and over any bridges. We booked into room 9, which is a large red bedroom converted from a kitchen. Beautiful and quiet, with a great bathroom. No view, but we didn't mind at all. Venice is so small, the Rialto Bridge is 5-7 minute walk and St. Marks is 5-7 minutes further, if you don't stop to shop. We loved being away from the hustle and bustle. Buon Viaggio!

<Content>Fabulous! My sister and I have just returned following a 3 day stay and absolutely loved this hotel. I booked it following recommendations on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed.We booked fairly last minute and subsequently got a room on the ground floor near Reception which I think had been adapted for disabled guests. The only problem with the room is that it had no view and was opposite the area where breakfast is pepared, if you are a light sleeper like myself you could easily be disturbed. The room itself was spotless, modern with a TV, hairdryer, ensuite bathroom (shower only) and a safe.Location wise it was excellent, literally 30 seconds walk from San Stae Vaporetto stop which can have you at St. Marks Square in less than 10 mins. However the best bit is that it was away from the main tourist drag and there were many pretty areas of Venice less touristy but equally as stunning.The hotel staff were very welcoming and couldn't do enough to help. We had fabulous weather and breakfast was served in the courtyard, this consisted of pastries, cereal, yoghurt, fruit and as many Cappucinos as you could drink! Would totally recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Venice - don't be deceived by the 2* rating.

<Content>Excellent hotel Stayed here in May of 2006, actually staying here right now! I have to say that at least up to now, this has been one of the best hotel experiences that i have had. We have just arrived from staying at the Park Lane Hotel in London and Le Meridian in Monaco and this hotel is truly amazing. It is a very short walk from the vaparetto stop and the directions we were given made this place very easy to get to.We arrived at 8:30 in the morning, obviously too early to check in and we were able to leave our bags, which were later brought to our room, given a map of the area (a very nice map showing exactly where the hotel is so that you can't get lost) and given directions to the fish and produce market. This was a very interesting market, which i would recommend that you do not miss. We had lunch and returned at approximately 1:00, our room was ready and our bags were already in it.The bathroom in our room exceeded what we had at both the Park Lane hotel (London) and Le Meridian (Monaco). The room is well decorated and the bed is comfortable. We will be back to Venice, and next time for an extended vacation. When we are back we will be back at this hotel. I will be sure however to book this in advance, because it appears to book up quite fast.

<Content>Perfect Hotel with Wonderful Rooms My wife and I stayed here for 3 days in April along with our baby son, my Mum and brother. The Hotel is in a great location only a few hundred yards from the Stan Stae Vaporetto stop on the Grand Canal so is very convenient for getting around easily. We took a private water taxi from the airport, which wasnt the cheapest way of arriving but a very comfortable one!We had requested a triple room for us, and a double each for my Mum and Brother, with a request for my Mum's to be accessible without too many steps. Our room (no 9) was a beautifully decorated and very spacious grand looking triple room, with a high beamed ceiling and one of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen in a hotel.Mum had a beautiful spacious double room (no 1), again with a beamed ceiling and a massive bathroom. It was located on the ground floor, just near reception, so exactly what she wanted.My brother had room 2, which was smaller than the others but again to a really high standard and ideal for him.Breakfast was excellent, with lots of choice, and the courtyard is a lovely setting. The staff were all brilliant - really helpful and polite and like all the others reviewers say, Sandro and Marco were the perfect hosts.There are some very good restaurants and shops close by, and the neighbourhood is really interesting and typically venetian. The hotel is also perfectly located for exploring on foot with the Rialto 10 minutes away (and thats going slowly with a pushchair) and St. Marks another 5-10 after that.We'd definitely make this our first choice place to stay in Venice and it is faultless - it's certainly to a higher standard than the majority of 4-star hotels I've stayed in in the UK, but with the added bonus of Italian Venetian style.

Very close to the water bus stop which made it perfect to reach all the sights. The courtyard garden is so pretty, too bad the weather was not good.

<Content>A little gem in the heart of Venice.. The Al Ponte Mocenigo is a lovely hotel in a good location. The staff are helpful and friendly. The room was of a very high standard and the continental breakfast was well worth getting out of a comfortable bed for... I would say the 2 star rating is conservative. This hotel is great value.However, our room was off the reception area (facing the court yard). As a result any moderate activity from those areas could be heard. We were also offered breakfast in our room on one occasion, but it was never delivered. Despite these minor issues, if I am ever in Venice again (which I definitely will be!)I would stay here again.

Excellent host, made restaurant bookings for us, made our stay very relaxing.Stayed for 2 nights over a weekend. At 90 euros/night (incl breakfast), very good value.Only negative was that our room (#4) was located directly adjacent to the breakfast room, so we suffered from a bit of breakfast noise each morning.

<Content>Brilliant Absolute charming hotel located in an excellent quiet location. The rooms and common areas are spacious, extremely clean and tastefully decorated (full refurb done in early 05).For us the best thing about this hotel was the service. Sandro (part owner  manager) was the perfect host. He is a local Venetian, completely unbiased in his views and recommendations, whilst his english was excellent.We stayed in room 6 that for European standards was large with two windows overlooking a canal. The bathroom was excellent and included a full size bath.The best meal we had was at La Zuccha which was recommended by Sandro (of course!!)Regards Jeff

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! Truly one of the great examples of Italian hoteliering. This small hotel tucked away on the north tip of Santa Croce in Venice offered a small bb atmosphere with excellent and cheerful service. Each room is done in a unique gothic Venetian style that is true to the architecture of the area. We even noticed a few fixtures to our room that we're sure were renovated from the 17 or 1800's. The location is very good as well, with quick access to the vaporetto taxi system running to all major tourist spots, as well as a reasonable walking route directly to San Marco. Combined with price, this little hotel receives an A++ in my book and is a must for any traveller to Venice.

<Content>No Need to Look Further - Perfect  Thank you fellow reviewers for leading us to this charming hotel in Venice. We stayed 3 nights in Sept. - our room was quiet and very large (we had the room directly behind the reception desk - I think #1. The bathroom (the pictures of which sold me on the place) was spotless and of high quality - bathrooms are important to us. I was skeptical of what I would find once I got there because of the low price, but the pictures looked great (also check out venere pics) and the reviews were good. In the end, it was truly elegant and exceeded my expectations. We overslept the first morning, even having the room right by the beautiful courtyard where breakfast was held, and completely missed breakfast but Walter still made us cappuccinos and croissants. Nice service!

<Content>You'll love these guys! We were very pleased with our stay at Al Ponte Mocenigo. It is very easy to reach via the #1 vaparetto (water bus), just a block away from the nearest stop. The hotel is nicely appointed--but be prepared for big, bold Venetian colors (our friends were in the bright red room; we were in a more subdued gold). Bathrooms were extraordinarily clean. There is no view other than other buildings RIGHT beside you, but while in Venice, your goal is to be out and about, right? From Al Ponte Mocenigo, you can catch a waterbus and get anywhere you need to go within 20-30 minutes.What made our stay worthwhile was the great breakfast (included), fabulous cappuccino, and excellent service. The guys who run the hotel are also at the front desk--and it shows. Two of them speak very good English. I thought I had left my trinkets for my daughters in the hotel room, and Walter was ready to go out shopping for me to replace them when they could not locate them. (They turned up in my suitcase pocket!) Now that's service...extending even to a former guest.In the evening, you can buy a glass of wine or other drink and sit in the small area outside. We finished our trip to Italy by leaving Al Ponte in the wee hours of the morning via water taxi (a 90 Euro ride) and our cab driver picked us up just outside the hotel lobby! It was a great way to finish a wonderful trip--dropping us about three blocks from the terminal.If you can't afford a nice hotel right on the canal, Al Ponte Mocenigo is a great option.P.S. The winding streets can be confusing. Best to return to the hotel via vaparetto when you've been out and about. And the airport doesn't open until 4:30 am. No need to arrive before then, even for an International flight! (We could've arrived at 5am for a 6am flight.)

New hotel with perfect rooms conveying the Venician atmosphere, easy access around the facility, wonderful breakfast, great host in Walter. It set the tone for our stay. We spent nights in Rome, Florence, and Venice during our trip and this was by far the best of our three locations. We have four children - they too enjoyed the hotel. Most economical of all our hotels too. I highly recommend it for a stay.

<Content>Beware Room #2!!! I use trip advisor reviews as a guide when I am selecting a hotel, so I decided to post this review to warn others, since all the reviews for this hotel have been stellar so far. The reviews may be accurate if you get the right room, but we were assigned #2, and all I can say is Beware!It is absolutely tiny, even by European standards - significantly smaller than a cruiseship cabin. There is a queen size bed, and maybe a 3 foot strip beside the bed (where there is a tiny desk) and along the foot of the bed. What makes it even worse is that the windows (2 little ones) look out on a brick wall that is about 2 feet away. Whenever we were in the room, we felt like we were in a dungeon, so we spent as little time as possible there. Thank goodness we were in Venice, so that wasn't a hardship! To add insult to injury, the price difference between this room and the other, apparently decently sized, rooms is insignificant. To the host's credit, he did advise us by email that the room was small, but the note was worded in a positive way, and didn't mention the brick wall view. Also to his credit, he did give us a ten euro discount for each night (which we didn't ask for; in fact we didn't express our extreme disappointment with the room to him verbally at all, but he likely read our faces).We had a few other problems as well. The shower barely drained (so that we had to keep turning off the water), which we reported, but they forgot to fix it until we mentioned it again on the 2nd day. Also, for some reason, toilet paper seems to be at a premium here - we were only given 1 roll, and had to ask for another one when we ran out, which I found embarassing, and not very professional on their part. The positives of the hotel are as stated in other reviews - a charming little courtyard, pleasant service, and a quiet yet convenient location.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place at all, and would definitely stay somewhere else the next time we are in Venice.

<Content>Wow - It was Perfect!!! WOW - What an incredible hotel. The Al Ponte Mocenigo was one of the most wonderful hotels we have ever stayed at. My husband and I stayed there 4 nights in November. The room (we had the triple) was beautiful, romantic and very clean, looks just like the pictures, even better. We had a chance to peak in other rooms when they were vacant, while they were cleaning them, and every room we saw looked great. Every person from the hotel that we spoke with was extremely helpful and informative and had great suggestions for restaurants and areas to explore. The courtyard (where we had breakfast in the morning and relaxing drinks at the end or our day) were romantic, elegant, in a word - perfect. All the reviews are true. I highly recommend this place. We were very sad to leave, and hope to return some day.

It's palatial (and not just for Venice) spotless,lovely and a VERY good bargain. The only bad side was the dull neighbourhood - a little out of the way. Still, I'd stay again in a heartbeat and try the Big Suite.

<Content>Fantastic Little Hotel Booked this hotel for my boyfriends 30th birthday and we stayed there for a week in september and it was a fantastic little hotel. The hotel only has 8 rooms in total  it didnt have one room for the week so we had to swap rooms a few times but each room was beautiful.The hotel is full of character, and the decor in each room was beautiful. The hotel staff were very nice and helpful. And the breakfast was divine - we got the most delicious warm croissants with apricot jam in the middle every morning which we both thought were fab. The little courtyard where breakfast was served was full of old statues and it was very charming. The location is perfect - very close (less than 5 mins walk) to a vaporatto stop. We had a lovely holdiay in Venice and I would definately go back and stay in this hotel if my budget would stretch to it!

<Content>Modern Hotel close to everything.. We spent 4 nights (Oct 10-14th) at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo for the end of our honeymoon and it worked out very well. We chose the hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor and the hotel was pretty much everything that previous reviewers had said. We decided to pay a little extra for the junior suite and it was very nice. The bathroom was supermodern and the jacuzzi tub was nice. The room was spacious and had a little balcony overlooking the courtyard. The bed was large, although I think it was 2 beds put together and could have been a bit softer (my preference). The location was very easy to navigate to. This was our first trip to Venice, so everything was new to us. We picked up the vaparetto at Piazza Roma (if you have large luggage, you have to get an additional ticket for luggage) and it was a quick and easy ride to S. Stae stop. The hotel is a short walk (couple minutes) from the stop. The back alley way is the best for luggage. You go straight from the stop and take a left. The bridge entry they give you is prettier.The hotel was walking distance to Rialto Bridge and San Marco Square. Plus with the vaparetto stop nearby it was easy to get anywhere. We went to Murano, Burano and Lido. We got the 3 day vaparetto pass which worked out well. Although it seems they only check your pass at the Major Stops. Rialto, Piazza Roma. Walter and Sandro were very eager to help direct us around and both spoke english well. They directed us to a couple restaurants and a pizza place nearby. Also, I had emailed them a few times before we took the trip and they responded within an hour with helpful advice.Breakfast was nice, Cappacinos, juice, crossants, cereal, fruit, etc. It is a bit colder in the mornings in October, so dress appropriately. I brought my laptop with me with my wireless card, so I was able to connect for free (I think) with a password from the frontdesk. I think they charge if you borrow, so ask.They have alot of television channels, however they are pretty much all in italian except CNN Europe and MTV Europe once in a while. You won't be disappointed at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo.

<Content>Gorgeous Hotel! We stayed at Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo for our 3 night honeymoon and would definitely recommend it for others! Walter and Sandro made us very welcome without intruding. We stayed in room 5, which although a little smaller than some of the other rooms, has the advantage of a balcony over the canal and views into the courtyard. We didn't notice any disturbance in the mornings. The doors to the wardrobe were originally room doors and a great piece of history. The Murano chandeliers were beautiful too against the wooden ceiling.The breakfast was lovely (apricot croissants, rolls, cheese, yoghurts, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee etc....) and the coffee great. The hotel also offers internet access at 5 euros an hour and have cables for your laptop if you need them.For those looking for a quick snack, Pizza 2000 is not far and a slice is just 1.70 euro's. There's also a nice bar near there, but I can't remember the name. We made very good use of the 22 euro travel pass which includes the road bus to Place Roma and the vaporetto around Venice! Worth buying at the airport to save queuing in Venice.There was a nice fruit  vegetable plus fish market on Wednesday close to the Rialto Bridge. This was good for picnic ingredients for a trip over to the Lido beach. Bread shops and a cheese / salami shop were also close to the market.Can't wait to come back!

<Content>Charming Luxury in Santa Croce My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo for four wonderful nights in September celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary. Our plane arrived late evening from London, and we took a watertaxi from the airport hoping we would arrive in time to eat dinner at a nearby restaurant. The hospitable evening desk clerk called several places and they were all closed. To our utter amazement, he served us ice cold glasses of Prosecco, proscuitto, cheese and bread so we did not have to go to bed hungry.Our room was a lovely (and large) jr. suite with beautiful decor, a whirlpool tub in the roomy bathroom, and a balcony. Breakfast was served in the lovely courtyard and was just delicious. The owners recommended superb restaurants and made reservations for us for dinner and even found us a very special restaurant for our anniversary. We highly recommend the Hotel al Ponte Mocenigo.

<Content>The Perfect Hotel My Husband and I honeymooned in Venice and came across this hotel online. Thanks to all the great reviews on this website, we took a chance and booked our room at the Mocenigo. Walter and Sandro were helpful from the day I contacted them by email. The hotel and their hospitality exceeded our expectations.It was the cutest hotel in a quiet neighborhood. When we found the hotel, we had to cross a little bridge and then enter a beautiful courtyard to the lobby. We enjoyed our breakfast everyday in the courtyard and were lucky to get a cappuccino made from each Walter and Sandro (they were both fantastic!)The hotel was close to everything, but far enough away to provide for an adventurous walk through the cutest neighborhoods to get to Saint Mark's Square. That was our favorite part of the day. The rooms were BEAUTIFUL, clean and quiet. I can't say enough about this hotel. I promised myself I would write a review because they deserve all the praise they can get. I just hope the next time we go back it isn't hard to book a room.I can't wait to go back. Thank you so much Walter and Sandro! Hope to see you soon.Gina and Rob - Los Angeles, CA

<Content>A Great Place to Stay Al Ponte Mocenego is a two star hotel that gives you five star service. Located close to to Grand Canal, with no bridges to cross (important when you are carrying luggage), this hotel is a wonderful place to stay at a reasonable price. Hosts Walter and Sandro are highly accomodating, personable and knowledgable, the rooms are very comfortable, and the breakfast is the best we had in Italy. If you can get a room here, take it!

<Content>Excellent hotel in great location Having returned to this hotel for a second stay since our visit in May, we were greeted warmly by Walter and Sandro, who could not be more helpful. The hotel is ideally placed for exploring the whole of the Venice area, particularly being close to a vaporetto stop, whilst away from the hustle of the San Marco area. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean, with beautifully furnished bedrooms  en-suite. The courtyard, where you can have breakfast or just unwind after a day of sightseeing is also a great bonus.

<Content>The Hidden Gem of Venice The Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo was absolutely wonderful. The concierges were extremely helpful and knowledgeable when recommending restaurants and giving directions. The room was very spacious and felt warm and comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful....the staff catered to every request and the croissants were hot out of the oven.With all that the Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo has to offer, the biggest surprise is the price. Venice is typically a little more expensive than other Italian cities, but the room rates were a bargain when comparing to the other options in Venice.Check out this hotel....you'll be extremely pleased and you'll have money left over to have a nice dinner.

<Content>The perfect place to stay! I enjoyed a four night stay at Al Ponte Mocenigo with three of my friends in the quad room. Like many before a trip to venice I was worried about various things鈥?Is the hotel close to the major sights? Is it easy to find? Will the rooms be clean and comfortable? Is it safe to book online? and so on.The day we arrived in Venice all my worries went out the window. The hotel was incredibly easy to find (only three vaparetto stops from the train station and a very short walk). Also, Al Ponte Mocenigo was a quick walk to the Rialto Bridge, but it was far away enough to escape the crowds of tourists and actually enjoy some less expensive and more unique shopping. Had we had stayed close to San Marco we would have never seen half of what we saw.The room was amazing. Dressed in rich red and gold tapestry and dark wood furniture. We never felt crowded, although we were four.The included breakfast was also great. Served in an outdoor courtyard surrounded by fresh flowers and sculptures. It included fresh fruit, yogurt, warm croissants and bread, jams, a variety of teas and amazing cappucinos (courtesy of Walter and Sandro).I would definately recommend staying at Al Ponte Mocenigo, especially for romantics.Thank you Sandro and Walter for making Venice...Venice!
