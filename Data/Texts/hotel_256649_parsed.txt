<Content>Great! Exceeded expectations We stayed for 4 nights in a 2 bedroom pyrmont view apartment. We arrived early (about 9.30am)  did not expect to be able to check in but our room was already available  we were promptly  efficiently checked in to our room. The porters at this hotel I have to say need a special mention they are courteous  very efficient, our luggage arrived to our room promptly. The 2 bedroom apartment was spacious  had 2 bathrooms a real bonus when you have 4 adults  an 18 month old staying. Plenty of room for my little daughter to run around  2 lcd tvs to watch, 1 in the lounge  1 in the master bedroom. The kitchen was spacious had a full sized fridge  plenty of crockery  utentsils. The pyrmont view I have to say was great, unless you really want a view of the harbour then the pyrmont view rooms are just as nice (good for plane watchers) Check out was just as efficient  when our taxi had not arrived the concierge was on the phone chasing it up without us even prompting, a very welcome service. The star city complex is huge with heaps of eating places of different standards  prices  the best part about star city is the access -light rail station right there which you can take into town  interchange with the monorail as required. Found this fantastic for getting around with a child also. Best value if you get on the light rail  get a 7 day metroconnect pass $28 gives you unlimited light rail  monorail travel for 7 days -even if you are staying less it is still a lot cheaper than the $15 day pass that you buy from the monorail. All in all I would highly recommend star city apartments to anyone wanting self contained accommodation in a great location of a very good standard. Add the good service on top of that as a bonus  I'm definately staying here next time I am in Sydney

<Content>Worth the price if you're watching a show My girlfriend and I decided to stay at the Star City Hotel since we were watching the Phantom of the Opera the same night at the Lyric Theatre (which is part of the same complex). We paid quite a bit for one night but we figured since the price included (1) accommodation, (2) parking (which is expensive in Sydney), (3) free breakfast and (4) the convenience of just going downstairs to watch the show. Best of all, we got upgraded to a very spacious apartment suite when we arrived - the curtains are even automatically controlled by switches (which was a bit of a novelty for us)!The only real problem I had with the place was trying to find it! It ended up being a very expensive trip after I inadvertently when through several tollways without even knowing it :(. But that's not a real criticism of the hotel, more Sydney itself (if you aren't a local).

<Content>Convenient We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great time. The rooms are exceptionally quiet given the vicinity to the casino... we never heard a thing! Very clean rooms. Staff Very helpful. Close to the harbour and transport links. Swimming pool was great.

<Content>Nice place! Okay, the Star City is a really nice and very well maintained hotel. The beds are very comfy, huge bathrooms and very nice facilities! The pool and hot tub are on the rooftop and very nice, but not open late enough. We only tried the food court and none of the restaurants (they were a little pricey) and it was okay, but we like eating where the locals do.Check-in and out were a breeze and the bell desk was excellent for info! It's located on Darling Harbour, which is a nice area. You can walk to most places if you're up to it, or take the public transportation, which is all right there. The casino was okay...it's no Vegas, that's for sure, but it's okay. We got our room at a heavily discounted rate from Skyauction.com, so it was definitely worth it for us, but I'm not sure I would pay the $200 a night it normally goes for. Overall it is a really nice hotel, very clean and very nice amenities with a pretty good location, if you can find a good deal or willing to pay the money for it.

<Content>Pure Luxury Star City is one those properties that is a great all in one adventure. The location is a bit out of the main stream being situated in Darling Harbour but connections to the city are easy with a city bus running by that goes to downtown as well as Circular Quay in addition to the rail and mono rail connections. The property itself has a wide range of restaurants from fast food (Subway) up to the white table types, as well as a live theatre on the premises, so check the schedule and book ahead. There is also a convenience store. It is also a close walk to Harbourside which has more stores and restaurants. The room was pure luxury with one of those marble bathrooms that has to be experienced. The staff was very helpful. Overall a great stay.

<Content>I've stayed in better 3 star hotels Upon being upgraded to an apartment, we were horrified to be stepping into a smoky non-smoking room. The decor was far from impressive, especially the cheap and tacky bits of chipboard passing for a bathroom cabinet.The robotic hotel reception staff seemed quite unplussed at my dissatisifaction, when I raised the above.The breakfast experience, at the Garden Buffet, was more like attending a food court than a 5 star dining room. Upon arrival the queue to get a table was more like attending the local club (RSL, pokies venue). While the choice of food was impressive and well displayed (and tasty), the sight of bus-boy trolleys clearing tables reminded me of the food court at the local Westfield shopping centre. Plus queuing for the egg station to have an omelete made would have been a novel experience if I could have been bothered.In future, we will be returning to the Wentworth, were the experience is truly 5-star.

<Content>Suite Life I stayed in a new star suite at Star City. These are the rooms that have just been released and they are spectacular. The decor is really upmarket and the first thing you notice on entering teh room is the fantastic views and the big LCD TV. The bedroom is even bigger with a massive spa and tv so you can kick back and watch your favourite show in the tub - which of course we did after ordering some room service - Bliss!The hotel is situated right next to Darling Harbour and a short walf to the CBD - but it really comes to light at night with the Casino, theatres, restaurants and my favourite 36 degree cocktail bar. We had dinner in ASTRAL, it was excellent, although a little on the expensive side - worth it though if you are celebrating.Overall a great stay, if you stay in the suite, bring an Ipod, connect it up to the stereo - easy, and set the mood with the mood light in the bedroom - choose a colour!

<Content>10 STARS for STAR City Hotel and Casino!!! This hotel exceeded expectations in every way possible. First off, the 2 Bedroom Suite was spotless clean as well as welcoming and comfortable. The location of the property is very close to attractions and public transportation. It was very tourist friendly as I was a first-time Sydney visitor. In addition, the restaurants and entertainment at the property were excellent. It ranged from low budget Subway to high end fine dining. The casino was also a ++++++++++!!! I would most defnitely stay here again!

<Content>Good location, but Casino presence unusual We stayed in the hotel as part of our honeymoon in Australia.The room itself was lovely and our special meal in the Pyrmont was fantastic. The location of the hotel for seeing Sydney was first class and this was one of our main reasons for booking the hotel in the first place.We did find the prominence of the casino in the hotel rather unusual making it feel that it was accomodation for the casino rather than a hotel in its own right.Overall if you are looking for a hotel with a handy location for being able to walk around and see Sydney, we couldn't recommend it enough.

<Content>Great facilities - but keep your eye out for reduced rates Star City has 24/7 convenience thanks to the adjoining casino, but the rooms themselves are a little tired. That said, they're still well equipped - the 2 bedroom unit we stayed in had everything we needed, except for the absolute lack of patio furniture. Beds were clean and comfy, and the lounge room was roomy. The hotel is starting to show its age though, and the standard prices are several times what they should be. If you want to stay somewhere nice and central (and open around the clock), check out local hotel websites in advance and you should be able to score a room here at half the price or less.

<Content>A faded star I was here last year, and returned because it was convenient to be staying here at this location in Sydney. I was assigned a room on the 9th floor, and was very disappointed with the state of the room, tired and grotty. stained carpets, scratched desks/furniture, chipped bath, not really 5* in any way. Expensive too, in fact twice what I paid for my fantastic experience across the Tasman in Sky City! There are plenty of other newer and smarter experiences within minutes of this place, don't make any special effort to book this place unless you find out his has been renovated.

<Content>Entertainment overload With family members from the UK, we stayed at the hotel, as opposed to the apartments, for three nights from 27/2/08. From check-in, throughout stay, to checkout, all staff members encountered were pleasant, couteous, efficient and helpful. This attribute, I believe is one of the best aspects of the hotel.The rooms were relatively well maintained, sufficiently well appointed in the room itself and the bathroom. The deficiencies were quickly remedied. For instance, the mirror in the entry area of the room could have been cleaner and on one particular day we found that tea bags were not replenished. Apart from this the service aspect was fine. When requested, teabags were brought to the room within minutes.The view from our room overlooked Darling Harbour and to the left we could see the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The booking was made, on the hotel's website, utilising their special offers tab. The accommodation offered for the price, which included breakfast for two, was considered to be good value for the area.On a personal level, I did not like the 'busyness' of the place but it was certainly a good location for elderly family members who found they had a lot of options to choose from and very little distance to travel within the building to see that their needs were met. After all it is a casino and entertainment complex, though not to my taste, to those it suits this hotel would be a good option.Though breakfast was part of the package, our bill did contain a charge for breakfast, which when pointed out to reception staff, was quickly rectified.Though I would not choose to stay here again, my family certainly will be and would recommend both the property and location for first time visitors to Sydney.

<Content>Fun times at Star City I stayed overnight at Star City in a superior Pyrmont view room. The room was a good size, with a very comfy couch and modern furnishings. The view was not great, but that was to be expected.There was one hiccup when we checked in at about 4pm, and were assigned a room which we discovered was had not been cleaned! The staff apologised profusely and sent a bottle of pink champagne to our room, which was a very nice touch.We had a fantastic dinner at Pyrmont Steak and Seafood restaurant, and enjoyed having the excitement of the casino on site and all the entertainment options it offered. The Lagoon Bar in the casino has an enormous waterfall and drinks are much cheaper here than in the Lobby Bar. I'll definitely return to Star City but next time I'll stay longer so that I can try more restaurants or see a show at the Lyric Theatre. One word of warning: convenience store is crazily expensive. I bought a toothbrush that had thai writing all over it for $8.00 I was prepared for a huge markup, but that's impressive! Nothing is priced and I'm sure that if they were, no-one would buy anything.

<Content>You are not here for the room! Star city was fine. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. I stayed in a Pyrmont room that looks over the Pyrmont Bridge (opposite to Darling Harbour side) View was not spectacular. On arrival my electronic key did not originally waork but this was quickly rectified by pleasant staff. The furnishing were nice but nothing special. TV has a great selection of channels but was an old 51cm tv which is very substandard when you pay $270 a night and other hotels charge less with LCD screens avaiable. Fantastic place to stay for the nightlife as the casino never shuts and there is always activity in the area especially on a weekend. Istay at Star City more for the fact that it is right on top of a great casino and good restaraunts not for the quality of rooms although i have never stayed in a bedroom appartment and these may be different.

<Content>Great service  Booked for 2 adults and one child. The beds were big and comfortable, with tea / coffee facilities. The bathroom was a decent size with large towels.The pool was rather unique. Part of it was undercover and the other half open air. It was supposedly heated but felt relatively cool. There was a children's pool that was really warm and steaming. Towels were supplied at the pool.The buffet breakfast (included in the package) was quite substantial and delicious. We could have upgraded and had it at the Astral for a few dollars more but was happy with the selection. They had a hot and cold selection and simple Chinese treats (dumplings, egg tarts, rice porridge). The staff at the breakfast place was extremely polite and friendly.The front desk was a bit inconsistent. My husband and child checked in around noon and was told to wait as the room was not ready. Fair enough as check in was 2:00 pm which is standard They were told they would be called as soon as possible. When I arrived at 3:30, I was surprised to see them waiting in the lobby with no information whatsoever. I approached the front desk and was given a key immediately - so the room must have been ready. There were no apologies.However at other times the front desk service was excellent.On the whole, the experience was rather nice. Although we live in the city, it was still pleasant t discover the Pyrmont side of town.

<Content>Views to die for At first we were put on the 5th floor (smoking) with two double beds, which was a very nice room but with 2 adults and a child it didn't leave much room for the cot etc. so we called reception and they had us moved straight away. We were moved to the 8th floor, huge king sized bed and the views are indescribable, breathtaking, amazing!!! Fabulous bathroom except had trouble keeping the water in the shower (could have been because we had a toddler trying to splash everything in sight) great pool area, didn't see the gym, we had the buffet the first night but enless you are a HUGE eater I think it is poor value for money. Had buffet breakfast included and that was lovely. Also won a bit of money at the casino, so all up I think it was a fantastic stay!!

<Content>Big and Brash - But we loved it! We stayed at Star City for six nights, having been recommended the aparttments by some friends. It's a huge entertainment complex close to Darling Harbour. We arrived very early (around 6am in the morning) but despite this unearthly hour the reception desk were very helpful and checked us into our apartment straightaway. Even if this hadn't been possible we could have used the pool and leisure complex to get freshened up after our long flight.We were staying at the apartments with our three daughters, aged 8, 14 and 16 and there was loads of space. We had two bedrooms and two bathrooms with a bed settee in the living area. The kitchen was really really well equipped with everything we could possibly have needed - and all the utensils and cooker, hob, fridge freezer etc looked brand new. The swimming pool was a slight disappointment in that it was quite small and very cold! However, we were so busy that we didn't need to use it more than once anyway!We couldn't have been more pleased with the apartment itself - although it wasn't especially cheap. I think we paid around 拢1250 for 6 nights. Although it felt slightly out on a limb - transport links to the hotel were fantastic. It was a five minute walk to Darling harbour - where there are scores of restaurants, bars, shops and attractions and of course ferries to Circular Quay...Although we were aware of the casino when we came downstairs we were never bothered by any noise from this or any of the many bars and restaurants in the complex itself. If you're expecting beautiful views of Sydney's amazing harbourside you'll have to pay a premium. And if you're wanting cosy and personal service - forget it! But this was just what we as a family of five needed. And we loved it.

My family and I stayed at Star City in April 07 for 5 nights and we all agreed it was awesome!We had two deluxe double rooms which were exactly what you would expect from this class of hotel: very spacious, extremely comfortable beds and contemporary decor.The concierge were extremely friendly and helpful in all occasions we needed to use a taxi.The hotel itself was immense yet luxurious. It has a casino, many restaurants (a few of which are buffet based), shops, theatre, pubs and leisure centre (pool and gym).The location was brilliant - very close to Darling harbour and short taxi ride to the city centre.This hotel was an absolutely excellent start to our holiday in Australia and we thoroughly recommend a stay here.

<Content>Not at all bad The Star City is a huge hotel, comprising shops, restaurants, a casino and a theatre. It is very well located in Darling Harbour, which it itself handy for everywhere and great for bars/ restaurants etc. We stayed in an apartment which was large and comfortable. This place came very close to a 4 star review and I should note my husband thinks it should get one. I have however marked it down for the following reasons:1. We paid extra for a view over the harbour. This is really not worth it, its just a view of high rises and in our case, a construction site directly outside our room. 2. There was a lot of construction work, which caused noise often quite early in the morning3. The only way to get to the pool due to the construction work was to get a lift down 9 floors, walk across the hotel lobby to another lift and go up 5 floors4. Most of the gym was shut for construction5. On the first day of our stay, we attempted to to to the 2 bars recommended by the guide book ( 38o and the one on the top floor) to be told neither opened on Mondays. 6. The mini bar was laughably expensive, more so than I have seen anywhere else Should the hotel not have been undergoing construction, it would have got a 4 start review as it was otherwise good.

<Content>Excellent apartments We stayed in one of the 2 bedroom apartments in March this year. We arrived early so we had to hang around for a while but they did call my internatioal mobile when the room was ready and we could use the pool and spa whilst we waited.The room was excellent. We did not have the view over the harbor but what we had was fine. The room was very clean and every day the maid but the dirty stuff in the dishwasher and turned it on!Location was second to non with 1 5 minute stroll to Darling Harbor with its attractions, resturants and the like. There is a Coles less than 5 minutes walk that is open late. The small shop at the hotel is expensive buy has the basics. The massive spa was good and we sat in there overlooking the bridge at night.Can't say anthing about the casino as we did not go (had young kids).We would go back if we went back to Sydney.

<Content>Outstanding location Stayed here following positive reviews on Trip Advisor.Darling Harbour is a terrific spot for restuarants, the aquarium and maritime museum are here and views from the city-side apartments are great (worth paying an extra $20 per night for). Easy access to the city centre either walking or via the bus (stop under the complex) that goes to the Circular Quay.We have two kids (10 and 8) and they loved the facilities. Apartment was very well appointed.We turned up early morning but were still able to get a room and the staff were very helpful. All in all a very good stay.

<Content>Good hotel, great location Chose Star City on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews, with concerns about staying at a Casino and that the location might not be the best. Needn鈥檛 have worried.Location, while not city centre, was great. A 3 minute stroll from the Pyrmont Bay ferry point to Circular Quay (陆-hourly service), 5 minutes walk to Darling Harbour. The casino is entirely separate from the hotel, the whole development being of the 鈥榤all鈥?type with all levels of eateries (smart restaurants to Subway sandwich bar).Accomodation was superb (Pyrmont view de-luxe room) 鈥?large room, quiet, great aircon, comfortable beds and immaculate bathroom. Arriving from the UK at 09:00 on a Sunday morning staff were very helpful and friendly, arranging an early check-in. Good outdoor pool and exercise facilities. Only ate in the Fortunes restaurant, the buffet being plentiful and appealing.

<Content>Only okay, too much waiting! We spent 7 days at this hotel, and after a few days, we wanted to change hotels. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were told our room was not ready and that they would give us a call as soon as the room actually was ready. Hours passed, still no call. We came back, and they told us the room was ready, but they offered no apology for not calling. To irritate us further, our room came with free buffet breakfast vouchers, which they refused to honour because it 'wasn't in their documentation' even though it was clearly stated while booking online on their official website. Their only suggestion was to find some proof online and show it to them, but they would not cover the expensive internet charges there for doing so.As for the Deluxe Pyrmont View room, it was generally modern and okay. However, the room didn't have a particularly good view and it was not well lit as the lights were oddly placed around the room. The bathroom had a bath/shower which was not comfortable and the toilet paper was attached to the wall only about 10-20 cm above the floor strangely enough. It is also worth noting that the floor level of the Deluxe room, which was apparently 16, may not have actually been as high as 16. Floors 4, 13 and 14 were simply missing and you could not access them.As for the rest of the 7-day stay there, we found the lifts to be infuriatingly slow to arrive at many times, the concierge gave us incorrect information and room service took over an hour to arrive at about 6 p.m. once. A warning to those staying with people under 18 or slightly above that age, the casino forms a large part of that hotel. If you are under 18, you'll usually have to detour around the casino to get to the other side of the hotel rather than going through it. If you are slightly over 18, you'll constantly have to get your ID checked every time you take a shortcut through the casino. The only particularly good things about the hotel that separated it from any other hotel of the same class was that it has good facilities including a casino, restaurants and theatre. The location was also fairly decent, being located near Darling Harbour and having light rail and bus services beneath it.Overall, however, we would not stay there again, we've stayed at far better hotels in Sydney.

<Content>Casino dominates My family of four stayed here for three nights in a two bedroom apartment. The room was fine - not four star but a decent three star. The staff was fine too. Location good for Darling Harbour and fish markets. Downside was the size of the place - it felt like a half mile hike to the restuarant for breakfast and the reception is on the opposite side from the apartments - you have to pass all the casinos and the dressed up clientele every time. We had to book here as we booked late and not alot was available - not sure I'd book again because of size.

<Content>Will stay again. Highly Recommended Myself and my partner booked into star city casino on the way back home from coffs harbour. From the moment we rolled up in the car everything was perfect. We arrived by car to have bell boys open doors and take luggage. From there we went on to checkin where we were upgraded to a king size bed for no extra cost due to a booking error that I made (not them).When we arrived to our room we couldnt believe the quality of everything. From the bathroom soaps to the bedroom sheets. The bed was so comfortable, we didnt want to get out of bed in the morning. We had so many showers because the pressure and volume it distributed was fantastic.The whole complex was of a very high standard and very modern. The rooms looked like they had been recently revamped and look stunning. The services throughout the complex was exceptional (and I am saying this as a restaurant manager by trade). The gaming floor looked a little tacky but there is a lot of good luck around the tables.When we checked out the valet attendant went out of his way to give us a map and directions on how to get out of sydney, melbourne victoria bound. Overall a fantastic experience. You see your money really well spent.

<Content>great for families We ended up staying here as the hotel we had booked from the UK was not up to standard. Star City was a welcome change and excellent value. We had a 2 bedroom apartment which was spacious, clean, well equipped and well maintained. it was great for us staying with 2 children. It is well placed for the monorail and darling harbour. there is a shop under the hotel if you wanted some basic provisions to eat in, or the hotel has a number of restaurants, we didn't try these though, they didn't open till 5.30 earliest, and due to jet lag, we wanted to eat before then.If we went back to sydney we would definitely stay here again.the staff were very professional and even let us into our room early as I was ill.

<Content>Excellent Our family of four stayed at the Star City Apartments for two nights in a two bedroom apartment. The room was excellent and very well equiped. The casino complex and all its facilities are 5 star. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great views Stayed at the star city and loved it. Had a great twin room, usual hotel layout but everything you would want.The hotel is a complex, rooms, shops, bars, casino etc. The casino is not quite vegas but i liked it.Go to the bar on the 17th (top) floor and sit outside the views over darling harbour and sydney are fantastic, especially at night, you can also see the harbour bridge from here.Only ate once in one of the hotel restuarants (steak house) this was ok but there are so many in the harbour and beyond at better prices.Great location as well, right in darling harbour where there are restuarants, bars, a club etc. You can walk to the rocks, circular quay in 20-30 mins but the ferry is only a 5 mins walk away that will take you there. (tip get a $15 aud day tripper ticket this lets you use the ferry, bus, trains all day) you buy these on the ferry and is a great way to see most of sydney for very little money.I would stay at this hotel again for sure if i return to aus.

<Content>Good - could be better Star City is an archetypal Casino Hotel. Good quality and slightly lacking in personality. It is nicely positioned our of the very centre, but that isn't an issue. It is only 20-30 minutes walk to the rocks and so on. We stayed in an executive suite. Nice big room on the corner and good value too. The inclusive breakfast buffet for non-high rollers is adequate but served in a slightly run-down canteen style venue on the 2nd floor. You can pay an extra few dollars and eat breakfast on the top floor restaurant Astral but all you get is a view and the same food. For dinner we went to Astral one night. We had a 7 course tasing menu with wine match - cost about 拢170 for two. To be honest, it wasn't bad, but they were struggling to service the room effectively. Bizarre wine match too - they served cheap spanish with two of the first three courses so I complained and they brought our some great Australian wine thereafter!! They did ask us what we thought, we were honest and they wrote and apologised and said they would take our points on board. I would stay there again, good value, good quality but not top-line.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic As previously stated by other reviewers the 'Star City Casino' is first class. We booked a two bedroomed apartment, it was superb, very spacious, two bathrooms, large kitchen, fabulous views, pool excellent. Location excellent, buses , trams and trains all stop here. Excellent value for money ticks all the boxes, would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Best deal in Sydney! My family and I stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. This is the best deal if there are more than 2 of you and deals are VERY hard to find in Sydney, believe me! Check-in was a breeze and we were offered a top floor unit (floor 16) with fabulous views. The units are very clean and very comfortable. The staff were always cheerful and helpful. If you have children do not be put off by the casino. It's there if you want it and can be ignored if you don't. It's a short walk to Darling Harbour but you have to be mobile to be able to walk all the way to Circular Quay and The Rocks. It's a good 30 min walk. Best take a cab but they add up as the traffic is quite congested and the meter keeps ticking. Lots of restaurants and bars and a convenience store on site. Local bus and City Tour buses stop right outside hotel and a water ferry to Circular Quay/The Rocks/Opera House is right outside too. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. Don't miss the breakfast buffet - it's fantastic!

<Content>Loved Star City Apartments We had a 2-bd apartment in Star City for a week and it was just perfect for our family. It was very clean, modern and large. Simple but nice furnishings and decor. The service was great, when needed. The pool is pefect for families, as well as the nearby activities, with just a little bit of a walk. Highly recommend.

<Content>Nice and neat hotel. I received a voucher from star city to stay at the hotel for 1 night for only $50. So I called and booked it in for 1 night. I could not choose any other room except Superior Pyrmont View room. (the most basic room on the level 5-9 floors)Checked in late around 4pm. Reception was nice and I received 2 card keys for a Deluxe Pyrmont View room on level 10. (whoa, didn't even ask for a better room. was pleasantly surprised.)Went up to 10th floor, opened the door and went into our room. (can't remember the room number now.) Well, it's pretty much a standard hotel room layout with the bathroom to the right of the entry door and a short corridor into the main bedroom with a King sized bed, TV/Minibar shelf and a small sofa chair in the back corner. Windows was large and there was a wall length area along the windows where it was cushioned so you can sit/lie down and this was a great touch to the room.Bed was comfortable and there were 2 low and 2 high pillows.Bath room was all marble with a combined shower/bathtub. Shower head was large and was not a water saving head meaning a good amount of water.Hotel was quiet. The curtain made the room so dark during morning that I'll guarantee it'll make anyone sleep in late. I really want one for my room.I didn't really get to do anything else in the hotel.Just slept coz I was so tired and went to work next morning.Overall, a nice little 5 star hotel atmosphere room with a great casino downstairs. But not worth it if you are paying full price of over $275.So either go through wotif or have a voucher handy. =)

<Content>Problem-free experience Nice and clean rooms, friendly staff, in summary problem-free stay. The only problem is that, although it is 5 star hotel, it lacks glamour (such as very simple reception area and entrance). The view from top-floor restaurant is very good, and food as well
