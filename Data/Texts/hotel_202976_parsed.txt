<Content>Saved our visit to Florence We were booked into the BH Club hotel. When we arrived at the BH it was dirty and very unpleasant. We walked around the neighbourhood and found the Rivoli. The staff were helpfull and welcoming. As tired travellers we needed a lsanctuary. They provided it. They showed us a room in advance of us booking in. The room was outstanding. We stayed at the Rivoli for three nights. The room was excellent, very clean. The breakfast was very good every day. Most of all, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Absolutely Magnificent We were on a business trip to Florence and had been booked into, and stayed the night at another hotel but had to move as our first hotel had a bed bug infestation!!We managed to find rooms in the Rivoli and were welcomed there with open arms by the incredible reception staff.The hotel is clean, nicely decorated, has good amenities and is centrally located. It is a fantastic situation for the train station, conference centre as well as all the great sights in Florence . All the staff were extremely polite, friendly and very very helpful. The breakfast was lovely with a terrific selection of bread, pastries, cooked breakfast items, fruit and beverages.There is also a nice bar area where drinks are served quite late into the night.We didn't get to try the pool as our original hotel didn't have one and we hadn't brought our swim wear.It wouldn't have mattered if we had because our luggage (care of Air France!!) was missing during our entire stay , only finally turning up 3 hours before we departed!!This was where the reception staff came into their own. They all worked incredibly hard making phone call after phone call to Air France and Pisa luggage handling to try to track down our cases. They could not have been more helpful or understanding, even though we took up a huge amount of their time. Nothing was too much trouble for them.I would definitely highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence.

<Content>Didn't pay a lot ; didn't get a lot Booked the Rivoli for a spur of the moment trip to Italy with 2 nights in Florence. With kids in tow we needed two rooms. Sadly, I did not recall I stayed at the Rivoli in 1997. Little has changed since then. The decor tired in '97, is exhusted in 2008. More importantly, the filthy carpet throughout and the moldy bathrooms need a good cleaning.The train station location was central, if a little seedy. The boys, 14 and 11, were happy with the whirlpool and the included breakfast was a savings. Try to book someplace else. I popped in at the Alba Palace across the street to check availability and price, they were fully booked. If the rooms are as nice as the lobby I'd give the place a chance.

<Content>Six Nights, Seven Days My wife and I spent six nights at the Rivoli the second week of June. The rooms were relatively clean, the beds firm but comfortable. Our room was on the courtyard above the pool, and noise could be heard when noisy people were in the pool or courtyard. Don't plan to spend any time swimming, as the pool is miniscule. Could also hear cars go past on the small street (almost an alley) behind the hotel but the windows did well keeping most noise out. The courtyard is a nice place to relax with a drink from the bar. Some noise could be heard from the room above us , but nothing unbearable. Water temperature in shower was uneven at times. A/C works well and easy to control from room thermostat. When exiting the hotel, be sure to turn right, as going left is a bit seedy, especially at night. There is a taxi stand at the nearby station, and the couple of times we called a cab after spending all day walking was easy, the taxi arriving a few minutes after being called by the desk staff. The bottom line is that the hotel is a Best Western, not a Four Seasons, so keep expectations reasonable. I would stay at the hotel again, and have no qualms about recommending it.Train station around the corner made a side trip to Lucca very easy. Trains are clean and comfortable, but if going to Lucca, keep track of the stops as the Lucca station is easy to miss if not paying attention.Italian restaurant across the street from the hotel is a good, convenient place for dinner. No need to search for good gelato, as some of the best we had was down the street on the corner across from Piazza Santa Maria Novella. Visit Santa Maria Novella church to see some spectacular frescos. Advance tix to Uffizi and David a must, as the lines are ridiculous otherwise. Guided tour of Uffizi was a waste, David was better but both got us in without standing in line forever.

<Content>Good location but paid too much We booked this hotel with our airline tickets as part of a vacation package with Northwest airlines. We ended up paying about $315 per night for a triple. The room was large, clean, and nicely furnished. The water in the shower was inconsistently hot and cold. Breakfast was very resonable, with both scrambled and hard boiled eggs, sausages (which tasted like little hot dogs), ham, cereals, yogurt, pastries, toast, and fruit. Hot beverages were made to order. Staff was friendly and have good recommendations if asked. We were traveling with a 4-year-old and they were particularly nice to her. Location is good - an 8-minute walk from train station, where you can also catch tour buses, etc. Self-service laundry was available down (and across) the street where you could drop you laundry off in the morning and come back for it in the afternoon, there was also a self-service laundromat 3 blocks down from the hotel that was open late and 7 days per week (traveling with young children means lots of laundry). We probably would have paid significantly less if we had booked with the hotel directly instead of using a package - but that being said, we still had a nice time at this hotel and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Worst night in Italy Spent our last night in Tuscany at the Florence Rivoli. We were put in a room by the whirlpool - didn't sleep with the noise of the water pumps! Ear plugs will come in handy! The window was over looking the patio - if we opened the blinds (one was broken...) anyone could look in. The front desk was not helpfull at all, arrogant even. Definetley not 4 star quality - you'll get a better price-quality relation in a superior 3 star in Florence.

<Content>Very good hotel We booked that hotel trough the Ryan air web site. We were quite please with it. This hotel is situated about 5 minute walk from the train station. It was very convenient since we had to take the train to go back in Pisa to take back our plane. This was a very clean hotel. The room size was great and the bathroom was very efficient and clean (one of the most important thing for us) We were off season so the price was very good. The people working at that hotel were friendly and helpful. It was conveniently situated near a lot of restaurants and bars. I would recommend that hotel if you go in Florence.

<Content>Beyond our expectations! From our arrival we received five star treatment. The staff were very friendly and professional. The room was spotless and comfortable. Although some renovation work was taking place outside during the day - it just didn't seem to matter as everything else was so good! The location was perfect - near to the station for travel to airports and Siena (a must) but in a quiet street close to all the main city attractions. The breakfast was excellent and the staff were always on hand if anything was needed. We had a great time in Firenze and were lucky with the weather - I suspect that the hotel arranged this as well! We would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone. We didn't try the 'hot tub' but look forward to a return visit.

<Content>Good for the price A pleasant enough 2 night say in February. Hotel communal areas and courtyard very nice, free welcome drink when you arrive is a nice touch. Breakfast is adequate. Our double room was OK, very blandly decorated and fairly small. Temperature not controllable except by opening window - quite hot even in winter. Bathroom very small, bidet and toilet opposite each other with about 12 inces between - very litle moving space. Shower temperature up and down uncontrollably. Continuous noise from music PA in courtyard til atleast 10pm - very annoying. Staff pleasant. If arriving by car (good luck!) then you have to pay 23euro a night for it to be valet parked in a local garage. For the money a decent enough stay.

<Content>A Very Good Choice The rooms are comfortable and roomy and well furnished. We had a courtyard view room and the noise level was low. The front desk staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are kept very clean and the linens are good quality. The breakfast is more than adequate and has a variety of food to suit a majority of people, and a very attentive staff. The bellman is courteous and helpful. The barman also. The hotel is near the train station but not close enough to hear any noise, and close to the Arno, Duomo, piazzas, dining. A good location. No negatives to report. We were with another couple and we all agree we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel .. Just come back from a beautiful weekend in Florence - Bristol to Pisa - Bus to Florence amazing 8 Euro . Would recommend anyone looking to go to Florence  save some money to travel this way. Simple  easy. Stayed ay Hotel Rivoli what a lovely place . had an excellent deal booking on line with hotel.com. The room we stayed in was clean, spacious and had a beautiful balcony area overlooking the courtyard which did make it even better as after a day of walking around florence it was nice to relax, reflect  enjoy the wine without any bother. Rm 216.Don't be shy using the hot tub/jacuzzi usually find people don't tend to stay in there too long anyway .Found the staff helpful ,particularly the bar staff they where great.I can honestly say I read hundreds of reviews before booking as it was my first time to Florence . Go, see for yourself you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Walk Florence from here! Just returned from a 12 day stay in Rome, Florence, and Tuscan villages. The trip was fabulous -- we weren't prepared for the extreme heat that Italy was experiencing. Our definition of air conditioning is not the same as Italy's. One note: be sure to insist on the a/c being turned on in your room. Ours was turned off mid-sleep, causing the room temps to rise to 89 degrees. The staff came to the room in the a.m. to fix it, but we were told to pack all of our belongings before leaving the room, just in case we had to be moved. When we returned, there was no apology for the inconvenience of the heat or repacking. After talking with other guests, we discovered that this seems to be a common occurence. As far as location, this is a great spot. Fairly quiet location, yet very near the main train station. A beautiful church is around the corner for Mass, if interested. We walked to the Uffizi area in about 20 minutes, leisurely. Within easy walking distances to the leather area, major museums, churches, shopping. Keep a good map ready ..... streets are laid out in quite a mishmash array when looking for someplace for the first time. We were pleased to see bacon and scrambled eggs available for breakfast. Too bad the pans were empty most mornings. Continuous requests for refills were ignored. The staff was very short with us the first morning, but eventually recognized us and seemed more friendly. The best restaurants were near the covered bridge and Uffizi Gallery. Toto's has pizza too good to be ignored. Give it a try. We never got used to dining in nearly empty restaurants. No matter what time we chose to eat, we were usually dining with only 2 -3 other tables of diners.  If you are staying an extended time and need laundry services, there is a self-serve across the street from the hotel, or, a larger one, down the street near the farmacia.

<Content>A Little Outdated, But Overall Nice We stayed at the Rivoli for two nights. They probably had the best service out of anywhere we stayed in Italy. (This isn't saying much, but still!) The front desk checked us in efficiently and booked us reserved tickets for the Uffizi. They also gave us excellent advice about the Galleria dell'Accademia, which is open until late evening on Fridays. So even though we did not arrive until about 4:00 that day, we were able to drop off our things quickly and head out in time to see the Duomo (closes at 5), Museo dell Duomo (I think open til 7), and the David--all before having dinner!The hotel itself is nice enough; our room with a queen bed had enough space, a comfortable bed, and was clean--the three most important things to us. The decor was rather boring , and while I notice other reviewers had new monogrammed towels, we had the old, worn, shredding ones! We most enjoyed the al fresco seating in the private courtyard; we had a lovely late afternoon cocktail there. We also liked the buffet breakfast, which was fairly modest, but still included a selection of sweet pastries, eggs, and healthier choices like fruit and yogurt.We did not use the small pool or hot tub, which were overrun by a family with several preteens on the one afternoon we considered it.The hotel is easy walking distance to all the sights--about 10 minutes to the Duomo and 15-20 to Piazza della Signoria. It's also close to the train station--good for us since we arrived via train--but in accordance with its proximity, the area is a little sketchy. I would not have felt comfortable walking alone as a woman down this street; the immigrant guys that sell the counterfeit bags seem to hang out a block away in their off hours, and we saw a solo female get heckled one night. This was not that big a deal though since we spent virtually all day out and about.For the overall price that we paid (125 euros a night), this was a solid three-star choice in Florence.

<Content>Comforable but noisy We did a lot of research before deciding on which (of many) hotels to book for our special first wedding anniversary in Florence.I put a lot of weight on the reviews on TripAdvisor. The Rivoli is just OK for the price. The front desk/concierge staff seem like they can't be bothered if you are standing right in front of them for quite a while before they deign to turn and give you some attention.The bathrooms are comically laid out. It is a challenge to bend over the sink when brushing your teeth or washing your face, or find a place to put your shampoo/conditioner/soap in the shower other than the bottom. There are no racks or places for those items in the shower.The breakfast is very good - lots of protein choices which is a nice option in Europe. Service is good at cetain moments and not others depending on whether there is a tour group in the hotel or not.Front desk staff, as in all of Italy, are bothered by interruptions by guests. Warmth toward customers is not their strong point.In fact, it was that last point that makes us not recommend this hotel. We told them ahead of time we would be there during our first wedding anniversary and that we never got to take a honeymoon so we were so excited to be in Italy for that, specifically Florence which is so special from an art standpoint. No special note, no personal welcome as simple as that would be, not even a special assist from the concierge for restaurant reservations to a basic local restaurant for our anniversarty evening. Oh well we had a good time anyway, despite the hotel staff!

<Content>Huge room! Good breakfast! My sister and I stayed at Hotel Rivoli for 3 nights. The room was huge and VERY clean! It is near the train station so it was easy to get to. However, the hotel wasn't super close to all the other restaurants and cool things to see. However, everything is within walking distance.I loved the free hot breakfast everyday. However, I think I gained 5lbs from eating in Florence. The bar and breakfast staff were super friendly and provided great service. Most of the front desk staff were nice except for the Night Desk man. When I called to ask if they had a fan. He was a total jerk. It was pretty hot at night. (Apparently, normally not that warm) He grumpily told me air conditioning wouldn't be turned on for another month and to just open the windows. Well, yes we did that. Next morning I got 12 mosquito bites. I had to go through the same thing the next 2 nights, so I learned to wrap myself in the blanket so I wouldn't get bitten. That part WAS not pleasant.At night, the area doesn't seem that safe to walk. There is a great restaurant down the street though, called the Crocodile. My pasta was awesome there.

<Content>ok,could do better I stayed in this hotel in November I took my mum for her birthday. On arrive the hotel looked ok, the person at the reception wasn't very helpful, we were taken to our room which was large for Italy but was traditional and could do with modernising. The hotel is not run by great western but by another hotel chain, so the identity for the whole hotel is a little confusing, as you have great western, I think it was Aris hotels and then the Rivoli hotel branding. I choose this hotel as it was a great western!!! we had a room on the top floor by the road side, the main disappoint was a weird smell in the room which came from the bathroom for the whole stay, we did speak to reception but they were full and didn't have any more rooms, then on the last day they had a emergency as they drains were blocked and the whole hotel smell horrible. I would take a guess that is what the smell was coming from the drain in our bathroom. I have stayed in Florence before and this hotel is near a square which there are two off, that have very similar names, so this was a little further out than I thought. I was so looking forward to this break and had high hopes for this hotel and was a little disappointed, it is a beautiful hotel, great breakfast and the breakfast staff were great but generally it could be great but it needs to do more!!!!

<Content>A very welcomed surprise Some of the reviews of this hotel were a bit out in left field;We were pleasantly surprised with The Hotel Rivoli. We just returned from a 4 night stay, The location is just 2 short blocks away. The good: Loved the room, we had enough space for a European size room, I thought. Very Very clean. New MongramedLinens were changed every day, they were ironed and felt very clean. Our room overlooked the beautiful pool and hot tub courtyard area. Very peaceful and charming. The breakfast was 5 star, the buffet had hots and colds, and champagne every morning for mimosa's if you wanted it. Served in a beautiful breakfast room. There is a nice lobby with different sitting areas and a beautiful dish with candy, nice touch. The front desk staff were top notch and very very helpful, We adored Massilamino, so charming to deal with. All the staff were gracious and welcoming and were eagle to assist American guests in english.To improve upon: I wish the bathroom could be bigger, it was hard to maneuver, but you get used to it. Every morning at 0700,0715, 0730, 0800, city bells go off and can wake you up,but it actually was different to hear. You really can control the lighting in the rooms which is very smart! in conserving Electricity...we are spoiled in the US leaving hotel rooms with lights on. At the Rivoli when your card is not in the slot the lights will go off in 2 minutes, be prepared!!I really enjoyed our stay there. I could not believe this hotel did not have a higher rating on trip advisor.

<Content>nice quiet stay Arrived late in Firenze, travelling with parents, into a whirlwind of traffic. Found Hotel Rivoli between train station (Piazza Statione) and main square (Piazza Republica) is a nice 4 star hotel. Staff was fine - no problems, no extraordinary care or service. We had been travelling and doing a lot of walking and it was a great respite to just park the car and spend a few days. Breakfast was full of food, from american scrambled eggs/sausage, croissants, proscuittos and cheeses, and cereals - more than enough. Internet access available for a very small fee. We had a very nice room, separate bedroom w/double bed for the parents, the sitting room for me - sofa-bed. All comfy. Shopping in Firenze - most go to Mercado San Lorenzo - the biggest tourist shopping area near San Lor Church. I found better buys for most items near the train station - a more seedy area, but shopped here for the co-workers gamut of trinkets - key chains, magnets, t shirts - prices were much better. Get your tourist shopping here in Firenze - didn't find much more of variety elsewhere, even in Rome. Shopping area near straw market had a nice jewelery place w/ good prices-saw same jewellery elsewhere for same or more. The loggia area right nearby ( open arched walking area in front of the post office) also had better prices on the nice paper items (Florentine stationary/books). Got a nice size extra luggage bag here for $10 - again, cheaper than San Lorenzo. Be sure to shop around. Right in the same Loggia area (covered walking area) was a restaurant that looked very pricey due to style and location, outdoor seating etc, but had an incredibly big steak (something you dont find in Italy) for a great price, and great pasta for great prices.  Shops behind the San Lorenzo area are also good buys for pretty scarfs and women's bags, etc.with a beautiful variety, and very willing to give us a better deal than priced. Food market at San Lorenzo (the mercado) has a great lunch,cheap, sit together- usually for the market workers - but closes about 2 so get there early. In same mercado I found good prices on olive oils (great bottles), vinegars, and pestos in beautiful jars. Italy is in an economic slump due to the Euro, so the shops, including hotels, were willing to negotiate. Found some cool watches near vendors at the Duomo - african dudes quote high but once you walk off price dropped quickly.Restaurant across street from Rivoli was great - good local food with good prices. Found another great restaurant, Abruzzo style food at Piazza San Marco called Accademia. A bit more upscale, but lots of food served beautifully. (take a cab - it was a long walk back). Hope this all helps! Have a great time in this beautiful and crazy city!

<Content>Nothing great, nothing bad I stayed at this hotel for 3 days at the end of Sep '06. I didn't want to write a review as this was the beginning of my vacation and I wanted to see what the other hotels were like in Italy (1st time in Italy) before I gave it a review. We'll i'm at the end of my trip and I think the hotel is just average. This hotel was booked for me by gate1 so I didn't really have a choice but the room I got was pretty average. I'm not sure what I ended up paying since it was booked through the travel agency but it was really just average. There was absolutely nothing special about this place. The guy at the front desk was kinda rude and not very friendly, the room was small (even compared to other Italy hotels) but on a positive note, it was close to everything, and it was fairly clean. Breakfast was a little better than the average breakfasts i've had in Italy. If you can't find a great hotel in Florence, this one isn't bad.

<Content>Lovely Location downtown but hard to find due to many one way streets. Parking in the street is free but the hotel need to know the licenseplate number in advance. Otherwise it is not allowed to drive around or park in the downtown area.An old building updated with care to modern standard. Very different but nice rooms, som with a little privat patio with table and stools. A very nice courtyard away from the noise of the city with first class barservice and a small pool. You can find bathrobes in your room.Breakfast buffet very good. Very friendly service from the hotels staff.

<Content>Terrible Service! Uncaring and Callous Our family spent three nights at the Hotel Rivoli at the end of out three weeks in Europe. Our journey was intentionally flexible so we would usually book hotels a few days in advance online and live by the Trip Advisor Reviews. Thanks to the great reviews we found some hotels along the way that were real gems! Unfortunately, this was no gem, it could have been very good but contrary to other reviews the service was awful and uncaring. It all started a few seconds after we arrived, the desk manager informed us that we had booked a double room not a triple. I suggested we review the document from Expedia in his hand, at the top read Triple Room. His answer was yes but you selected a double bed. I explained to him that there were only two choices on the online form, twin or double, but no matter I selected and paid the premium for a tripple. He responded that even though I paid for a tripple because I had selected a double-bed I get a double room. This ridiculous exchange went on for fifteen minutes when he finally acknowledged that he was not sure he had a triple and wanted to keep one open for a guest who may stay another day. I finally prevailed. I was hoping that this was an isolated incident and the other staff would be more service oriented. My hopes quickly faded as I interacted with Team Rivoli, I asked for a restaurant recommendation, the reply was an arm pointing to the east stating that there are many good restaurants that direction. I did find that the bartender was kind and helpful, I hope someone reads this review from the hotel and promotes him to manager. Bottom-line, don鈥檛 trust that you will get what you paid for or that they will honor your online reservation. I see others reviewing this site have been turned away, not a pleasant experience after a day of travel and five blocks from the train station. The location is convenient, the rooms are ok, however the pillows are unimaginably hard and thick, and the bathroom was a contortionist鈥檚 dream - 9 feet long by 3 feet wide. The price was reasonable presuming they give you what you paid for, but there are much better hotel options, regrettably not available for me, if you are traveling in the off season 鈥?not in August. In summary, this is the most disappointing hotel service experience of my many nights in hotel rooms, a true case study in bad hotel management. If they can get their act together, hire some professionals and show some integrity and caring, they may well find themselves in the top ten of the Trip advisor list.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed from April 1st to 10th 2006. We went with a tour group, so we didnt need to take our bags up. The elevator(only one) is so small that only two people can fit, maybe three skinny ones. Many of us decided to climb stairs. The rooms are good, at least we got one with balcony and courtyard view, better than the street. This hotel is pretty central, but you will need to walk a little to get to the piazza Di la Signora(where the status and Uffici are) after you got to the main places, you can walk everywhere easily.For people that dont like to walk far, this maybe not the best one.Service ok, breakfast good.

<Content>Spacious but Expensive Stayed here in June. Location good, just a short walk from the train station. Easy to walk to all of the sites in Florence. Small patio area, nice on sunny days. Very adequate breakfast. Rooms were big (we had a quad) but decorated very basically. Little noisy facing the street.

<Content>Lived up to Expectations There is no point repeating the comments on other reviews. The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff are excellent. Ask for a room away from the front of the hotel as the street is noisy early in the morning. It seems local properties receive deliveries from approxiamately 5.00am. The outside bar courtyard area and additional garden at the back of the hotel are very quiet and relaxing

<Content>A find! We rate Best Western's Hotel Rivoli as an excellent bargain. Not posh to be sure, but delightful nevertheless. The breakfasts were sumptuous, and the beautiful courtyard relaxing. The location on a quiet, safe street was a plus. Peaceful, yet it was very close to the railroad and bus stations, and within easy walking distance (no more than about 20 minutes) of almost all of the Duomo side of Florence..

<Content>Fabulous Stay My friend and I stayed for three nights at the Rivoli in Florence. This was a lovely, quaint, friendly hotel where the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. We asked for a room with a balcony and were given a very pleasant room at the rear which overlooked the hotel's courtyard areas and surrounding rooftops and roof gardens. The standard of cleanliness was very high - with clean, crisp white sheets provided every day! The breakfast buffet was good, with a hot choice each day and served by friendly staff. The hotel was well located within a stone's throw of the S M Novella train station and within 5 - 10 minutes walk of the main centre, the river and a whole host of restaurants and bars in the main piazza's etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Rivoli and would recommend this hotel to others - but ask for a room to the rear as the front rooms, although perhaps slightly larger may be a bit dark and be affected by noise from the street.

<Content>Booked a room - maybe not !! This hotel was recommended to me so I booked a 3 night break for March 06.Before I left I had emailed the hotel twice to confirm that they had our booking and to also inform them that we would be arriving late (11.30pm).My booking was confirmed and I was told Don't worry about your late arrival we will hold the room for youYou can imagine how annoyed I was when we turned up to be told there were many room problems and told that we would have to go and stay at another hotel in their chain. This seemed to happen to another guest in a previous review for this hotel.As it was the other hotel was fine but disappointing that we did not get the chance to stay in the hotel that we actually booked and paid for. This other hotel was also cheaper per night than the Rivoli and we were not offered any kind of compensation.

<Content>Well done Rivoli! Very good choice - 10 out of 10! Service, standard of the room and breakfast were all excellent. We would definetely like to go back! The hotel is in the heart of the Florence but still quiet  close to the main train station. Very convenient, comfortable  easy to find.

<Content>Nice Charming Hotel We stayed in the Rivoli hotel for 1 night 27th January 06, and had a very enjoyable stay. The rooms were very spacious and well furnished. The Front Desk staff were very friendly and helpful, expecially Francesca. Breakfast was very plentiful. The only difficulity we had was finding the hotel, with the very difficult 1 way system around Santa Maria Novella church / Rail station. Finally found Via della Scala and then found out we did not have a permit to enter the city, it was sorted by the front desk staff, as they had to register the car with the local police station, by midnight, otherwise we would have to pay a fine. The car was then parked in a nearby garage for a fee of 鈧?0.00 and brought back to the hotel the following morning, takes about 15 minutes. Will definately stay at the Rivoli sometime in the near future

<Content>Excellent property Stayed in this hotel for a nice February break. We were a little concerned about the area being unsafe, but it all proved not worth worrying about. The Hotel is great - charming and clean, our room was not huge but really nice, and the staff was very helpful and extremely friendly. Would definitely go back there - in fact, wasn't brave enough to try the lovely Jacuzzi hot tub, maybe in a warmer climate...

<Content>Pretty place, convenient to the historic landmarks, and a great night's sleep! Spent one night in late November. Booking late on internet, we got a reasonable rate and were expecting good value for money. Our experience confirmed our expectations.The valet parking facility is actually very convenient, and the fee is not very different from what local garages would have charged you when access to the historic centre was allowed in the past. The hotel will also remove for you the limited traffic zone violation fine (68 euro I think) that gets automatically triggered whenever someone drives into the bounds of the historic centre without an appropriate permission.The hotel, a monastery in the distant past, has a pleasant historic feel. Our superior room had a small waiting room, LCD TV and a large and extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was long and narrow but well appointed. Nice breakfast room with on average decent quality food (although fruit juices are all but natural!)The hotel is only steps from Santa Maria Novella church and railway station, and therefore minutes away from many of the most the stunning landmarks (Duomo, Piazza della Signoria, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio).Would definitely come again and recommend it, given location, overall quality and value for money.

<Content>A Great Hotel! We recently stayed at the Hotel Rivoli traveling in a group of nine. Upon arrival four of our suitcases did not make the trip with us. The front desk called the ailines every hour and they had them to us in less 48 hours upon arrival. We had 4 rooms total and all of them were very nice and clean. Each one was different in size and one had a balcony, one had a fireplace, one had an LCD television, and one had a couch. The bathrooms were nice and big.  The bartender from india was extremley nice. He reffered us to our best meal in Florence at Bucca Mario. He was very nice and very informing. The hotel is a very easy walk to the train station, about a block. The hotel is right on the same street as the Piazza Santa Maria Novella which is a great place to just hang out at night. It is a very short walk from the Duomo. The Ponte Vecchio is also within walking distance about 15 minutes. The real David is also in walking distane. The hotels location is just superb. Tons of gelaterias and good restaurants all around the hotel. This is just an amazing hotel and i recommend this to everyone who wants a nice clean hotel with moderatly big rooms great service and a great central location to everything.

<Content>Rental Car held prisoner, but not a bad place Rental car hell!!! We rented a car to see Italy and trying to find Hotel Rivoli with the car is heck. But nice lady at the desk talked us in finally (Thank goodness for my cellphone).Then found that to park car at a garage that is not owned by the hotel, was about $25.00 a day. Beware of driving a rental car there but if you do, get good directions and plan to budget in parking fees. Did not even get offered welcome drink (which may have alleviated our stress at trying to find the hotel, but after thinking about it, it may have taken more than one).Not far from train station.Hotel room was clean, bathroom was a little small but not uncomfortably so (it is Europe so expected).Breakfast was good and plentiful. Not a complaint but dont expect your bacon crispy.Walking distance to shopping and many sights. Map was available at hotel desk but not detailed so look at purchasing one outside somewhere.May stay here again if we come in on a train but using rental car, probably would look else where.

<Content>Overbooked We had booked this hotel through Expedia for June 21-24, 2005. First time we had ever used an internet company to book hotel reservations. We had reconfirmed our reservation a week prior to our arrival. Once we arrived on the 21st we were told the hotel was overbooked and did not have a room for us. To say the least we were upset and angry. We had chosen this place because of the close walking distance to all the tourist attractions and the rail station. They put us at another hotel owned by the same company. However, it was so far from all the tourist attractions they we had to pay for a taxi all the time which gets expensive. We don't mind walking but the temperature was 95 and it was humid. There wasn't a breeze blowing so it didn't take long to get really hot. Rivoli said it's not far from the tourist attractions but when I tried to pin them down on the distance they wouldn't reply. I knew it would be far but at that point we didn't have a choice. They did pay for our taxi fare to the other hotel. They did offer for us to return to the hotel if their were any cancellations on the other nights but at that point we thought, no way. I would not stay here even on our return visits because I wouldn't be confident that we would have a room even if they said we did.

<Content>Very pleased with Hotel Rivoli Stayed at Hotel Rivoli 2/17/05 - 2/20/05. Excellent location, 5 minute walk from the train station to the hotel. No more than a 15 minute walk to all of the major sites: Duomo, Accademia Museum, Uffizi Gallery, Ponte Vecchio Bridge etc. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was very good and a nice way to begin the day. We did not find the area to be seedy or unsafe. Many nice reasonably priced restaurants near the hotel. One restaurant is a must when in Florence: 'Acqua al 2' on Via della Vigna Vecchia, 40r. You'll need reservations but it's worth it. The filet in blueberry sauce is wonderful. There was only one negative about this hotel. The temperature for the rooms are controlled at the front desk. Our room was always very cold even after requesting the temperature to be increased.In spite of this one inconvenience, my family had a very pleasant stay at Hotel Rivoli.
