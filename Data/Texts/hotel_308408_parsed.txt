<Content>We always stay here. We have been staying at the Inna Kuta for 3 years now and we stay as a family(3 ) in one of the beach front bungalows. we ahve never had a problem with our accomodation nor the quality of the room. We will be going back in may and septmeber next year and we would not stay anywhere else. My girlfriend and her husband have been staying there for many mnay years in a bungalow and it was them that put us onto the Inna. We now have friends that only stay there as well and they go every year.The staff are excellent and nothing si too much trouble for us. Room Service is alo great. we love the fact that the beach bars are right in front of us and I can sit on my vernadar and watch the passing byers. Also I can see my 12 year old son out doing his thing.

<Content>Great stay We originally stayed at another hotel for one night and that was awful so changed to Inna Kuta. The service was great. The staff were friendly and helped us whenever we needed it. The pool bar is the best. The hotel was clean and food was nice. Had no problems with anything.

<Content>Worst hotel stay ever I have just returned from my trip to Bali, staying at Inna Kuta Beach Hotel. This hotel was highly recommended by my Indonesian friend (who ironically does not live in Indonesia) who has been to Bali twice. Sad to say, I am deeply disappointed by the state of this hotel. Never mind the fact that the hotel looks old and decrepit, I kept my doubts and reservations aside to check this hotel out. First up, my request for a double bed was duly neglected due to overwhelming occupancy for the double bed hotel rooms. Secondly, the state of the room is shocking. The bedsheets had weird patches of stains all over. Thirdly, the toilet looked so dirty and old that it was in such a decrepit state. Coupled with the fact that the shower water smells strange, and the towels reek of chlorine. Showering was definitely not a pleasant experience. Overall, if you are looking a clean and hygienic accomodation, please make Inna Kuta Beach Hotel your last choice. You have been warned.

<Content>In my opinion... Good location. Situated close to the Kuta Beach. Within walking distance to other shops eg Crocs, (in case you need a comfortable open-air slippers after getting blister on the foot!), Hard Rock Megastore, and other shops that sell local products eg souvenirs to bring back home.Rooms, probably need some improvement. Doesnt look like a 4 star hotel. No carpets on the floor. (but I'm not so particular about this, since most of the time I spent lots of time outside for sight seeing) In need of more lights in the bathroom. Otherwise it appears a bit eerrie..Probably need a better water quality. (Yes, the label - Air peran tidak aman untuk diminum- was there). Every time I brush my teeth, it feels a bit salty whenever I gargle.Breakfast, need to have more varieties of food. Since Indonesia is a Muslim country, probably it's good to have food labeled as HALAL or NON-HALAL for Muslim consumption. The other good point is, in front of the restaurant, you can have your name carved on the wood, done by a wood carver, and you can bring this back home as a souvenir.

<Content>Not Good Enough Inna, Kuta, previously Natour. Over the years have stayed and enjoyed. This time extensions/building??.Pool Bar, a major attraction to stay, no longer exists, though rebuilding.....finished when?Room given very end downstairs, very dated, no lift for luggage etc.Relax, zzzt no power, what the....leaves wires hanging out of socket, sure to be safe!!! Next day zzzzt again, in middle of a movie.Workers walking past our dismal area, no privacy, digging holes, banging into the night, eventually went out to stay sane!!Get back to room, flooded with filthy water and footprints from workers having traipsed in!!!! UNBELIEVABLE.Could not have shower/bath brush teeth, boil water,( lurvely holiday.) Thanks Inna Kuta.!!Obviously spoke to management, to no avail, on last nite can change rooms, the room was worse and stunk!! Left stressed and extremely annoyed, would never stay again, unless a respectable room/functioning accessible with some outlook, and ammenities provided.Position on Kuta beach is the only plus, pool area needs to be fixed and at least some drink service......too hard to walk over to ask patrons if food or drink is desired!!!Better off going somewhere else really.

<Content>Good location, in severe need of revamping Having stayed here many years ago, I decided to book myself into this hotel as I remembered that it was a good hotel right in the midst of bustling Kuta. Having arrived at the hotel I realised that yes, the hotel was right in the heart of the bustling area, near the shops and beach, but the hotel looked like it hadn't changed since I was there all those years ago (i'm talking 1998!!!). Everything about the hotel screamed 'renovation', the lobby was dilapidated, with paint coming off the walls and even the grass looking like it hasn't grown properly in years. The rooms are average at best, with marks on the towels and floors. In addition, the staff seem to not be that bothered to even smile at you. Oh, and another thing, the breakfast is very very disappointing, so much so that the waffle station (which doesn't operate everyday) was filled with ants!The good thing about the hotel is that the pool is very large and right on the beach. This is contrasting to the other hotels in the area that do not have direct access.Overall, I would not recommend to stay at the Inna Kuta. I definitely did not deserve its four star rating, and it shocked me to see that their certificate was renewed in July of 2007. I would suggest to stay in any of the various other hotels in Bali, which look far more maintained, Kuta Seaview being our favourite along the beach (cross a main road to get onto the beach), and the Ramayana Hotel looking fantastic at very respectable prices, albeit slightly further away from the beach.

<Content>Great and convinient location Stayed 2 nights at Inna Kuta for a retreat organized by an Indonesian government ministry. The hotel has a traditional Balinese architecture, rooms are spread in 3 stories and some are in bungalow styles which are great for a family holiday. The hotel has a perfect location for those who'd like to enjoy Kuta Beach. It has a direct acess to the beach via the hotel's swimming pool. Very close to local atractions and plenty of restaurants  cafes. Staff were friendly, room was clean. Great (grassy) terrace area with large swimming pool too. Local food in their lunch buffet are very tasty, although they are not well presented.The downside is that the main building  lobby are bit dated, need some new revamping

<Content>Great location/dirty hotel Let me say the hotel location is great for the beach and shops.It has a big and nice looking pool.The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful.Saying that we would not stay there again.The room was tired and dirty - the air con only working intermittantly.Dirty towels - Dirty, grey  something slimy/smelly all over the towels.We requested replacement towels but they were not much better - we decided to purchase our own towels.There are a lot of unfriendly Indonesians staying there.We were the only Australians staying there.The meals and drinks were expensive for Bali prices.We would never stay there again!.

<Content>Good location Inna Kuta Beach hotel Great location right on the beach which we spent most of our time.Handy to shopping and resturants.Cant understand people complaining about cockroaches as i was there for a month and never saw one.Pool area was great big pool and pool bar ,only complant was that the staff were very slow to clean up tables around pool.twenty one % tax on every thing you brought at hotel made it very exspensive .But on beach you can get a beer or drink at half the price.Would i stay again NO Because it is not a hotel for Australians too many asians and muslems which there cater for more .Any way still had great time and going back in March differant hotel

<Content>TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! Terrible experience!!Front desk speaks a awful english even for a Brazilian like me. The room we reserve wasn't available. So they transfered us to a villa. What supposed to be un upgrande it was a downgrade, II guess!!The air condition breaks every day. There are roaches everywere, the sidewalk to the villa was slippery....The location is good. Very close (walking distance) to the main shops and restaurants of kuta (if you could get to the destination without being disturbed by taxi cabs, salesmen etc....)We spent 4 days here and move to a resort in Nusa Dua. Weshoud have done this since the begining...If you are not teenager, surfist or anything like that go to another place....

<Content>Crooked Staff Run Great Hotel!! This hotel has the best location in Kuta! right on the beach, with the best pool / pool bar I've come across in my 15 trips to Bali. Lots of kids around the pool during the day and rooms are spacious and clean except the bathrooms which on each occasion (3) have smelt terrible and I've been unable to air out the room or get rid of the smell. Not a partying hotel. Breakfast is okay. Most recent stay was ruined by staff member who checked us in and bascially black mailed us for $100 AUD for a room with a bed suitable for two people which we had booked. Stated we hadn't booked that room and there were none available. If we paided up he would see what he could do. Hotel was practically deserted !! It's fine to batur on the streets and pay a little more than needed but not in a hotel. If you have another hotel in mind avoid the inna kuta. Mecure in nearby and awesome!

<Content>Roaches were everywhere Inna Kuta Resort has some of the most beautiful grounds on Kuta beach, the hotel has direct beach front access and the staff there are very friendly and responsive to your needs. However, we stayed there and found the hotel rooms to be in very a very poor state. The main problems with our rooms were cock roaches. We stayed in a standard room with a king size bed and the first night we had more then 7 cock roaches in our room, two of them were located in the bathroom while the ret were in the main room.the staff did come in a sprey with a normal bug killer bought at any store, however the roaches were still there later that night. They moved us in to a suite the next day and then two days later we found cock roaches in our bed.When we were checking out we did thank the staff and tell me we had a great time except for the roaches, however the reception person denied there was any problems in the hotel with roaches. This would be fine except that our mother's room also had roaches and the day before we checked out and the day we checked out we found several hotel staff going around the rooms spreying for cock roaches. Also we heard another guest complain to the desk about 5 minutes before we did about the roaches also.The hotel is in a great location, the pool, the grounds and the resort itself are all very beautiful and nice, the rooms need to be redone and brought more up to date and the roaches need to be seriously taken care of.

<Content>Roaches galore The grounds and the people are wonderful. Once of the most beautiful landscaped hotels we have stayed at. The problem, the rooms are over run with roaches. We had our room changed and still had the problem. When checking out, even though we saw hotel staff spraying for bugs in various rooms, the staff denied that they had a problem.

<Content>The most memorable holiday ever We stayed at the Natour Kuta beach and found this to be the most memorable holiday ever. Only minor complaint is that there is no lift, and trying to carry our luggage up all the stairs was bad, we have reduced mobility, but the staff kindly moved us to a ground floor room after the 2nd day. Bali is a magical place and does not deserve the atrocities over the past, it broke our hearts. We took 3 teenagers with us who also loved it. The Balinese people were the nicest, friendliest people we have ever had the pleasure to meet, always smiling. We would dearly love to return some day but the 18+ hour flight was particularly gruelling and so uncomfortable. We cannot return until we can afford to upgrade our flights due to our disability, and that may sadly never happen. The hotal is beautiful, staff excellent and food wonderful. Shops right on your doorstep and the beach right behind you. you do get pestered on the beach but a smile and polite NO goes a long way.Thoroughly recommend this fantastic place.

<Content>Right on the Beach This was our first time in Bali. Decided to stay here after all of our other choices were already booked. But so glad we did. It's one of the few hotels that are right on the beach and it's close to Poppies Road. The pool is so great - just make sure you get out early to reserve a lounge chair. The breakfast is very good and the staff were helpful. Easy to get places by foot but if you wanted to go to Legian or Seminyak, taxis were so accessible. Highly recommend the hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>Superb we have stayed at the Natour Kuta Beach twice in the last 4 years, and each time, the place seems to just get better, and the surroundings outside the hotel changing all the time. This place is centrally located in in the 'mad' town of Kuta, leading into Legian, but once you are in the grounds, you are in your own little paradise. the bungalows are 1s class, and are about 15-20yards from the beach, but in the grounds of the hotel. You do not pestered in the grounds, but once outside you do, but no matter where you stay in Bali, you will get pestered to degree anyway, by the street venders.The Balinese people are the nicest people you will ever meet, any where in the world, they would give you there last bowl of rice if they new you were hungry.the last time we were there,was in 02 for their new year, and that was probably the best time we had.For us, the food, the lifestyle, the shopping and most of all the hospitality of the balinees is fisrt class, and would reccommend this hotel to any family or couple looking to stay in bali.nb;no matter where you go in the world, each place has it's problems, but we have not seen any here, apart from the obvious and if there is, it is isolatedThis time we have a third additon to our family and we plan to stay in this hotel.enjoy

<Content>Great location Fantastic location, the only hotel in Kuta that is right on the beachfront. Good sized pool, though if you are late getting up in the morning like we are then it is sometimes hard to find a sun lounger. Good beachside restaurant and helpful staff. Ask for a sea facing room - the view from your balcony at sunset just cant be beaten.
