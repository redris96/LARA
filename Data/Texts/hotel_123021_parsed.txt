<Content>Very well situated I stayed at the Silver Cloud almost 3 weeks under some heavy circumstances, one member of my French family being hospitalized at the University Hospital. The staff was always kind to me, helpful, smiling. The rooms had nothing extravagant, but were very practical, quiet and clean. At last, the hotel is well situated, not far from the Huskies stadium, the hospital and the University village, where you'll find any convenient store.

<Content>Nice Place to Stay I haven't stayed at many hotels in Seattle however I travel alot and this hotel is very nice. This is my 2nd time staying here within a 10 month period and I always feel safe in and out of the hotel. They have wine and o'dourves on Tuesday evening 5:30-6:30 which is really nice. It was also nice to see some of the same staff members still working here from the last time I stayed here.

<Content>Spotless Hotel My family of 5 stayed at the Silver Cloud-University for 4 nights in Aug. 2008. We reserved a Suite which included a king bed and a pull-out sofa. Unfortunately, it made the room(s) much smaller. The family really liked the 2 large plasma TVs in each room. Although the room colors seem outdated, we were all impressed as to how CLEAN the room and the bathroom were (it's been a while since a hotel bathroom impressed me). The breakfast buffet had a great selection and was constantly being replenished. I thought the price was a bit high, but breakfast and free wireless internet was included. The hotel also has a nice pool. Our one minor complaint (which was partially our fault) is we believe our son's stuffed animal was accidently put in a trash can (by his brother). I wish the hotel maid would have taken it out or turned it in to the front desk. oh well.

<Content>Good location if visiting University of Washington The Silver Cloud near the University of Washington is very functional and family friendly. It has the usual continental breakfast included with the cost of the room common to other Silver Cloud Inns which we find very good. You can basically make a simple breakfast like most of us eat at home: toast, bagels, coffee, juice, yogurt, waffles, that sort of thing. The shuttle service is common to all Silver Cloud Inns and this one will take you to points within three miles of the hotel. We took the shuttle up to the university bookstore (which was big and excellent by the way). Later the shuttle picked us up and brought us back to the hotel when we phoned for it. I noticed not too many people tipped the shuttle driver which I thought was kind of cheap as the shuttle service saved us a lot of hassle if we had taken a taxi, bus, or driven ourselves. Note: the shuttle service at this hotel won't take you to downtown Seattle as it's over the three-mile limit. There is a big shopping center right next door to the hotel with plenty of shopping  restaurants.This hotel is great if you are attending any functions at Husky Stadium. We walked to the stadium from the hotel in about 15 minutes through a very safe area. The rooms are clean and big enough. We were two adults and two teenagers and got by ok with two queen beds and a sofa bed roll-out.There are no spectacular views from the Silver Cloud Inn University like there are at the Silver Cloud Lake Union. However it is functional, safe, and easily accessable from Interstate 5. The staff are very friendly and helpful. It also has free laundry facilities which can be used till 9 P.M. The fitness area is not great and there are no mats in it at all so plan to do your stretching in your room rather than on the hard floor of this fitness area. There are some aerobic machines and free weights as well as a universal gym aparatus. We would stay there again if we were visiting the university or going to a Husky football game.

<Content>great for university visitors Stayed for three nights for graduation festivities for our son. The rooms are average but spotless. The continental breakfast offers a wide selection of cold foods. There is a waffle maker, and plenty of comfortable seating space. We made use of the hotel shuttle on several occasions , an added plus. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. I would definitely return to this establishment and recommend it to all who want to stay near the university.

<Content>OK. Kind'a pricey with nothing to justify it The hotel was clean, well kept. The rooms were average to perhaps slighty above average. Some have nice plasma TVs.The location has nothing going for it except two things- It is near the heart the University, and there is a pedestrian/bike trail right along side it.PROs- Front desk staff was very good- nice, helpful. They will shuttle you around to local places, but their schedule is somewhat regimented. House keeping people did a good job and were friendly.The complimentary breakfast is good. It actually had food that contain protein- hard boiled eggs, cheese, yogurt, peanut butter, self made waffles, lots of fresh fruit (whole oranges, apples, bananas, etc) oatmeal, cerals, etc.CONS- My discount rate was very high- $179/night. The PROs do not justify the price. It is not exactly just off the highway. Seattle traffic is bad, and you will thoroughly understand that statement after staying at this hotel.There is no nice place to sit outside. The only outside benches are for smokers, and they sit right next to the busy street. Bummer, for being in such a nice climate.Recommendations- Get a room on the 3rd floor or higher, on the north side. (South side faces student housing and we had a student party go on until early morning hours.) The 1st floor is the basement and the view is the parking lot. The Second floor is the reception floor. The 3rd floor rooms have nice(r) views.

<Content>good place for business traveler Stayed here one night for business travel.Hotel is fine for mid-range hotel. Room was clean, comfortable, large enough, though not what I'd call spacious (maybe ~250 sq ft). In-room coffee, fridge and microwave. Breakfast bar was ok, the usual assortment of cereal, pastries, yogurt. I didn't notice if they had hot items. Breakfast area was large. Fitness center had about 6 cardio machines, a weight machine, and some free weights. There are several places to eat within a few blocks (walking distance), and even more if you have a car. UW campus is within walking distance, but hotel also provides free local area shuttle. Hotel is right next to pedestrian/bike path.Superior: 3 computer stations with printers in the business center. This is better than most hotels I've encountered. Plus there was no additional charge for internet access and wireless.

<Content>Show me your money, credit cards and luggage My husband and I have stayed at the Silver Cloud and recommended it to other friends who have also found it to be convenient to the UW stadium. Recently, during a home game at the stadium, we left our purses in one of our friends' rooms and came back to no purses, wallets and a suitcase was gone. The maid hadn't made up the room and it is our belief that someone on that staff alerted a thief to grab and run. Management didn't see that way although the Seattle police certainly felt strongly that it was more than likely an inside job. So, the rooms are nice but don't leave your suitcases, jewelry, money or packages in the room. Better yet, sleep outside, but make sure you get a pass to put in your windshield or your car will be towed.

<Content>Great place to stay In a small commercial area near a residential one. Couple blocks away from major supermarket and shopping center. We stayed a week and found it reasonably priced. We don 't eat out much so being near the supermarket was handy. A little difficult getting to with the nearby exit off the Interstate but we got used to it. Good continental breakfast. Pool was good. Needs a TV in the workout room.

<Content>Sliver Cloud University - Great Hotel What a gem of a hotel in the University district of Seattle. The rooms were clean and had wonderful amenities. But what makes this place tops in my book was the staff. They were so knowledgable and helpful for two tourists from Ohio. We send kudos to the night desk guy (Mark?) who was so helpful to us as we checked in and gave us all kinds of great tips and really made our stay enjoyable. The breakfast was a bit more than continental (waffles, etc.) and was wonderful. My only complaint is the parking. Spaces are really tight due to lack of real estate in the area.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay Driving to the hotel from Interstate 5, there are a couple of confusing turns but the directions we printed from the hotel's website got us there without a problem. Parking is free  we didn't have a problem getting a space. Because we booked late for a special event weekend, we had a king suite, which was bigger than we needed - also more expensive. However, it was nice having the extra room. The sitting area had a large, flat panel TV mounted on the wall but, as far as we could tell, there weren't any HD channels. There was also a TV in the bedroom. The kitchenette area had a microwave, refrigerator, bar sink  4 sets of dishes  silverware. The vanity/sink was outside the bathroom. The hotel recently opened a new fitness center which was a lot larger than their old one. The continental breakfast was ok but was very crowded. There are lots of restaurant choices at the upscale University Village mall just 2 blocks from the hotel. We thought the food at Atlas Foods was excellen; there was a lot of fresh seafood but other types of food as well. The front desk clerk recommended Speciality's Cafe for lunch; the food was good  the cafe seemed to be very popular.

<Content>a little worn We stayed here for 3 nights because we wanted to stay in the University district to be near a family reunion. Also, we had an excellent experience at the silver Cloud Lake Union a few years ago. We paid full price of $159/ngt. for a spacious room with two queens. The beds were comfortable and the linens good quality. However, the furniture and carpets, in the room and in the hallways, were worn and shabby. This place is nothing like the Lake Union Silver Cloud. The check in clerk was rude and unhelpful when we requested a quiet room. We finally got a room on the third floor. A baseball team was staying on the fourth floor, and we could hear them tromping around late at night. The breakfast room is shabby, and the breakfast is minimal. The pool was dirty. We would never stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Value and Comfortable Close to Uni Fantastic value and comfortable room and bed. Quiet, even next to elevator. Staff were very helpful and happy. Breakfast was continental and sufficient for my needs. Great location near Uni Village shopping mall as the fridge was empty. I stayed for 5 days. The pillows and bed were very comfortable. Shuttle bus to Uni was responsive, great service and great location. A mix up with the check out date was the only inconveience and thankfully the staff corrected the situation with ease. Great spot for conference attendees.

<Content>Previous Reviews say it all I got to agree with all the previous reviewers, this hotel is awesome.I stayed here back in September visiting the University and everything was great. It's right next to a classy mall, the hotel has shuttle service to many places. It does not go downtown, but that's ok, you can hop a cab and it's really quite cheap. The staff is incredible, come straight to your need whenever you ask for them. Breakfast was wonderful, a lot more than your standard continental, that's for sure. I will definitely be back.

<Content>Unequalled Service Anywhere!! I stayed at this hotel for my birthday last January as a present from my my daughter, and I can honestly say it was a most wonderful birthday present. I was treated like a king there; the staff was wonderful, and the room exceeded all expectations.I am in the hospitality industry myself, so I tend to be critical when I stay at other properties; knowing what good service should be I am not easily impressed. If you have a chance while in Seattle, WA., don't miss a night at the Silver Cloud at the University district; you will not be dissapointed.

<Content>Great Location, Good Service, Very Clean I stayed at this Inn for four nights in Mid-May 2005 and had a perfect stay. The rooms were nice, the front desk staff was very knowledgeable and helpful and the location was extremely convenient. The Inn is located adjacent to the large University Village Mall which has many good restaurants as well as good shopping. The Inn provides a free shuttle which will take guests anywhere within 3 miles of the Inn and this includes the bustling Univ of Washington student hangouts on University Way and Brooklyn Ave with their many ethnic restaurants. There is also inexpensive express bus service into the Seattle City Center where you can catch the monorail or waterfront streetcar to visit Seattle's major attractions without having to worry about parking or one-way streets. The included continental breakfast was well stocked and included such things as a cheese platter, boiled eggs, and several diffrent kinds of pastries as well as the standard fare.

<Content>Great Location! We stayed at the Silver Cloud for 3 nights while attending a wedding. Because we had 3 adults, we chose a 1 bedroom suite. The bedroom was a separate room with a sitting room area and small kitchenette. The room was very comfortable and reasonably priced. The complimentary breakfasts were excellent with a wide assortment of items to choose from. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the University Village Shopping Center with restaurants and great shops!

<Content>Great place to stay! We stayed there on July 18th, 04. If you are going to Childrens Hospital, this is the place to stay. It is about 5 minutes away. Has a pool for the young ones and an excellent continental breakfast in the morning for free. Restaurants right across the street. Friendly staff and free internet access. Alson provides a shuttle to hospital if needed. Very quiet and safe neighborhood location. Is a little off the beaten path, but well worth the search!
