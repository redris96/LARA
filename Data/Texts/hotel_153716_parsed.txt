<Content>Another Old Hilton Old, Old, Old.Only stay there if you HAVE to. Being in the airport itself is easy and convient to get to.The food at the restaurant is quite good though.

<Content>Great hotel for transit Very nice hotel. We stayed here due to late arrivals and early departures so we didn't really get to use the facilities. Excellent location as it's right inside the terminal and close to the terminal restaurants and facilities. Nice, clean rooms and great service.

<Content>Excellent hotel - very convenient An excellent hotel even for an airport hotel. It is conveniently located in Terminal 1 but only a quick train ride to Terminal 2. Given the uncertainties of Mexico City traffic, I highly recommend the hotel for anyone with a morning flight.The staff is outstanding. They took care of every thing I needed and even upgraded me to a mini suite for a little more room. At check out they checked me in on my flight and printed out my boarding passes. Overall a very good experience and you don't even realize you are in an airport hotel until you get off the elevator into the Terminal.

<Content>You could do a lot WORSE Like most folks, we just had a one night layover in Mexico City before heading off to Acapulco. We found the hotel to be clean, well maintained and comfortable. The 24 hour 7-11 in the airport lobby just below was an added bonus. If we were to return to the property, the only request we would have would be a room which overlooks the terminal rather than the street which approaches the airport. Rooms on the street side have double-paned glass (to insulate the noise), which get so dirty from the smog that they are opaque ... and there is nothing really to see anyway. The breakfast buffet is good, and well-presented.(I can understand the frustration of the people who arrived in the newly-completed, Terminal 2 ... but realize that this is not the Hilton's fault ... in addition to the train, there are Suburban-like shuttles which will take you back to Terminal 1).Finally, YES, the rooms are small ... but pleasant, and quiet. There are some dicey hotels around Mexico City, some of which require a pricey cab ride. If you are there only overnight - this should be your only choice.

<Content>Convenient if you arrive in Terminal 1, otherwise get ready to ride the train. Only convenient if you arrive in Terminal 1. Otherwise get ready to take the train. The room was nice but nothing special. Nice amenities, and Starbucks is just outside the hotel lobby. BUT, be prepared for the STINK. The entire hotel, not just the room, smells like sewage. The room was especially bad. We turned on the room fan, which helped, but it was still bad. We were completely beat after a red-eye flight, so we slept anyway. If we were more than one night, or not so sleep deprived, we would have checked out and asked for a refund or credit.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel-Clean! For an airport hotel the Hilton Mexico City Airport is great! The staff is wonderful and is able to help with any request. Rooms are a bit small, however I had a king bed, desk and chair in mine with room to move around. The bathrooms were CLEAN and NICE! The cleaning staff does a great job with fresh water every morning. The hotel is on the third floor so it is quite safe with Hilton security in the lobby. Great business center with two computers and wireless connection available throughout the hotel. (no wired ports in the room) If you are here for a week as I was I would recommend booking a room with the breakfast buffet! It is great and custom order. If you want anything else just take the elevator down to the main hall and you have a mini city with everything you could imagine to eat. Local to American! You have it here! Workout facility is clean and nice.The only downfall I found was with the smoke of the airport. I stayed in a non-smoking room however there are no real smoking laws in Mexico City. Although the room was smoke free smoke comes in from the main airport check-in and the lobby. I don't think there is much the Hilton can do about this. This is the first hotel I have stayed in that I did not want to rip the comforter off the bed when I arrived! It was spotless! Room comes with a small electronic safe in the closet that is great for the passport and cash, however if you have a laptop, don't plan on leaving it at the hotel. Flight Check-in counters are at the bottom of the escalator-Easy! If you have business at the airport or are transferring through I would highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>What's not to like? I love this hotel I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Mexico and while this is not the cheapest it certainly is one of the most American like hotels around.No beating around the bush, the hotel bes are very comfortable. The comforters the pillows and the mattress are of much better quality than other hotels in Mexico. While this location is not ideal if you have an early flight or are just heading to Mexico City and heading back out quickly it is well worth the price.Recap -comfortable room - best airport location available - good service.

<Content>Very good hotel ! I stayed at this hotel recently two times in last May and June.As I had saw several negative comments on this hotel, I was afraid that my stay could be also not very much comfortable.But in reality, I found no problem and became to love this hotel a lot for the following reason.1)Location is naturally excellent. After having checked in early in the morning at the the Airport, I could returned and had very pleasant breakfast at this hotel.2)Room was comfortable and clean. I had stayed before at Camino Real but Hilton's room was much better.3)Staff was also very friendly.I will definitely return to this hotel in case I make transit at Mexico City.

<Content>Hilton Mexico city airport I have stayed there on several occasions. I do find the hotel to be noisy. A couple of times they were doing some renovations on the departure level and the hammering went on all night. If you get a room overlooking the interior of the airport you hear announcements all night long. Stay at the Camino Real. It is connected to the airport by an pedestrian overpass and far superior for less money.

<Content>nothing against the Hilton here There is not much choice around Mexico airport and whence coming from Europe after a long dayflight, nothing is more convenient than taking the elevator to the 3rd floor and tuck into your bed.No noise, no nuisance, just a plain vanilla comfortable airport hotel that is not yet in need of renovation.

<Content>Very expensive, but incredibly convenient and unique! I have now stayed at this hotel twice, booking through hotels.com, and find it to be a ultra-convenient and unique experience. Most imporant: I have NEVER experienced a bad smell! My room smelled perfectly fresh each time. Upon check in I was handed a card-key within seconds of giving them my name - with absolutely no paperwork or anything. I went straight to my room.The first time it was slightly far, no big deal, and faced the inside. This was unique, actually looking down on people walking to their gates. Dead silent, though. The second time my room was 103, facing the outside, but right by the lobby. This was noisy, so I asked for a room further away, and was handed another card-key within seconds. This room, I believe to the left, was still close, and faced the outside. Planes taking off right outside my window. Slight noise, but not a problem (good windows), and still unique.The room was like every other Hilton I have ever been in. Some rooms, though, are larger than others, but absolutely comfortable in every way. I prefer rooms with character in old colonial hotels, but for one night before my 7:20 am flight back to the U.S., it was great!That's the key point. You are in the airport, minutes from check in. I went down early (4am - but I'm a bit nuts), checked in, and went back to my room for coffee. Most unique, you are right in the airport. To really appreciate it, you must see Tom Hank's film, The Terminal. When you step out of the elevator in the hotel lobby, you are in the middle of the restaurant area. Strange place to spend the evening. There are buses directly from and to the airport from a number of cities. I always go directly to Puebla or Queretaro, and directly back. I have not been in Mexico City at all on my last four trips. I will definitely do this again on my next trip, and stay at the Airport Hilton.

<Content>The good the bad the ugly I have stayed at this hotel on three seperate occasions here is what i have learned. The first tiem i stayed at the hotel my room was to the left of the checkout, the windows were on the inside of the airport and it was a mile away NIGHTMARE, on my latest visit i realized i had signed up before as a hilton gold member they gave me a room to the right it was much newer and nicer and only 2 minutes from the lobby, the room service was fast and not too bad. My advice ask for a room to the right ask for an outside window. For a connecting flight there is no better place to stay its like 10 minutes from luggage to check in to bed.

<Content>Surprisingly simple and basic for a "Hilton" chain hotel I expected more from this hotel. It's expensive only for its location. My room was small and a little run down. Restaurant food was fine. Location is good for anyone arriving late or leaving early, but besides that I would recommend something other than this hotel. SAFE TRAVELS - thedonk

<Content>The worst hotel I've ever known It is definitely overpriced for its quality. What's more, the management is pathetic. They charged me a deposit of $100 dollars to make phone calls, and instead of giving that back to me at check-out, they deducted it from my bank account. I've been communicating with them but they are so slow and inefficient, and I still have not gotten the money back. Two months have already passed since. I don't even want to recall this terrible experience....

<Content>Good choice for any type of connection My wife and I read the reviews after booking needless to say we worried. Landing in Mexico City there was a smell of petroleum. This smell on weekends for some reason is more evident. Needless to say the service at the Hilton was great. I accidently booked a twin room and Roberto the manager of english decent was kind enough to upgrade the bed for us with no problem. The bell boys very attentive. The overall service was great. The room was up to standard of those Hilton is know for. You have to insert the key card in to the power activation devise near doorway for bathroom power. internet for wireless or wired customers is free. We stayed two nights prior to final destnation and they were great. I give the Hilton Mexico City staff a thumbs up for making our stay a good one.The smell that some complain about is raw petro fumes not sweage. Just run water for 30 minutes in tube and flush toilet two times when smell comes uup and it stops it for a fairly good time its only happend Saturday no smell detected on Sunday night nor Monday morning.We plan on returning in July and the Hilton Mexico City Airport is our choice again.

<Content>Not a good choice in Mexico City The last reviewer was exactly right about this hotel. Sewage smells coming from the bathroom, rooms that overall are not Hilton quality. If you are arriving late into MEX and absolutely don;t want to have to take a late night cab ride to the main hotels on Reforma or in Polanco, then be prepared for an overpriced disappointment. the convenience factor is unbeatable as long as you know what you are getting into. Since construction is ongoing near the hotel entrance, good luck even finding your way to the elevator. And forget about internet access....I have never seen such outrageously priced access ($20 for 2 hours!!!!!).

<Content>Explore Other Options The convenience of a hotel within an airport is a huge draw so, despite the bad reviews, I chose to stay at the Hilton Mexico City Airport against better judgement. In hindsight, despite a late flight in and an afternoon flight out, I would have taken a cab from the terminal to another hotel. For the price one pays at this Hilton, it is awful accomodation. The sewage smell (I'm not exaggerating) emanating from the bathroom and the dank and dirty room, overall, were certainly tough to swallow considering it has the Hilton name (and price). Unless you're absolutely bent on convenience, I strongly suggest you look at alternatives.

<Content>Very Convenient But Not Up To Hilton Standards After a long flight, never having been to Mexico City before, and only speaking a smattering of Spanish, it was very convenient for me to simply get through immigration and customs, walk down the terminal corridor, and go up a couple of escalators and an elevator to arrive at my hotel.Unfortunately, after I'd been in my room and unpacked, I discovered that the lights in the bathroom did not work. I was too tired and it was too late to try and switch rooms so I managed by the hall light, but it was definitely a bother.I only stayed one night, and overall, my room was fine. The A/C worked really well, which for me was a very good thing. With the entire airport concourse below, you had a lot of options as far as food. They called me a taxi the next day for my meeting and I later discovered on my trip back that their taxi charged me about double what another service charged me to drive me back (350 pesos versus 180). Not a huge difference dollar-wise, but still something to beware of.They had WiFi access in the room, but to connect, you had to call the front desk to get a passcode. Again, not a big deal but given other existing technologies, an unnecessary complication.All in all, considering that this was a Hilton-brand property and not one of their budget brands, I was underwhelmed.

<Content>left hotel very sick i awakened very ill from the heavy sewer smell in the room. the rest of the hotel seemed okay. my wife and i were throwing up, having the runs, dehydrated and full of aches/pains.the hotel thinks that there is nothing wrong with this. i was literally denied boarding to head back to dfw because of my condition. i begged and begged and was able to convince the captain i could fly.the hilton has yet to answer my complaint or refund my stay. they also have medical bills to pay. the best part was that this hotel does not speak any english. save yourself the hassle, i heard the marriott is the place to stay. i also have booked the sheration at ----- before and that was great.

<Content>Very convenient I have stayed here 4 times now, after the long intercontinental flights from Europe that get in late at night, it is simply great to just walk up the stairs from the international terminal and be in your bed 5 minutes after you exited passport  customs. Good: Rooms are quite spacious for an airport hotel. Not quite as big as comparably priced rooms downtown, but at least 3 times the size of something like the Miami International Airport Hotel, where the rooms are just exactly the size of your bed. Ample room to work and relax. The rooms have been recently refurbished and look nice and clean. The hotel now operates a highspeed WLAN (54MBit) but it is very expensive. If you are lucky you can catch a ride on one of the free WLANs that transmit from the various Premier Lounges at the terminal, in my room I was able to connect for free. Also very good is the excellent breakfast, lots of good Mexican dishes, choice of eggs and variety of cereals, fruits, bread and pastry.Bad: On some days of the year, the entire airport smells like a sewer (you'll notice it as soon as you land) and this bad smell then also enters the hotel and the rooms. Not the fault of the hotel, but simply a problem of the bad pollution in Mexico. Also, traffic into town is much much worse in the mornings than if you arrive late at night, so if your final destination is the city, you may want to consider going downtown right away.Finally, the terminal is currently (March 2005) undergoing major reconstruction, so there will be noises for the next months. Luckily the hotel tries to move all guests as far away as possible from the construction work, I had no problems in my room.

<Content>Overpriced Very expensive, not great service or food. But the conveniance is impossible to beat.So if you are anxious about your safety, want to avoid cab costs going to a hotel in the city and need a place to stay in Mexico this works. I have stayed here a number of times because you just can't beat the conveniance.
