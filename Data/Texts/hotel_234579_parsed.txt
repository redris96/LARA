<Content>Nice hotel, good enough for the money We stayed in Amrey during December visit to Barcelona. I agree with most other reviewers - this is a very basic hotel but it is good value for the money. The rooms are very simple with almost no amenities. The staff is very attentive. The hotel is located in a quite, safe residential neighborhood right next to a very big (and beautiful) hospital. It is 10 minute walk to Sangrada de Familia, biggest cathedral in Barcelona. This location is also a stop for most tour buses, so you can begin a city tour here if you would like to. There are 2 trains stations 5 minute walk from the hotel. I recommend using different stations depending if you are going to or from the hotel to avoid walking up-hill. Trains arrive every 5 minutes, and it is easy to get to most popular places in Barcelona with 15 minutes. There is free wireless internet available, but only in the lobby.What we liked - location, valueWhat we did not like - wireless internet is not available in the rooms, only in the lobbyTrain station - going TO hotel:L4, GuinardoTrain station - going FROM hotel:L5, Camp De L'arpaGoogle map:[--]

<Content>Superb Just got back from 3 nights in barcelona. I will keep this straight to the point:Location: Ok its not in the heart of las ramblas but its only 5 mins walk from 2 metro stations which gives you VERY easy access to the city. Location in my opinion was perfect, i wouldnt want to be on the ramblas as too noisy etc. The room: The room was as clean as any ive ever stayed in, ok it was basic but all rooms are air conditioned. shower was very good too.Staff: Very friendly and helpfulThis hotel is perfect for a short break, prehaps even longer.

<Content>exceptional staff We just returned from 3 weeks in Europe most of which was in Spain. We loved the Amrey Sant Pau in Barcelona. We had to book two rooms because we were 4 people but it was a great value. AAA found the hotel for us. The staff were exceptional. They speak English and were able to help us in many ways. They are very professional. We loved the location near the beautiful Sant Pau hospital. The hospital is actually quite lovely. The hotel is a bit off the beaten path of Las Ramblas. However, we were able to walk to most places. The hotel is about 5 blocks from the Sagrada Familia. The breakfast is also excellent. Lots of choices with fresh fruit. They have one computer in the lobby that is free internet as well. We came from the train station and were shocked that we were charged one extra euro for each person and one euro more per bag. There was also an additional charge for coming or going from the Sants train station.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Modern, Clean and very helpful Staff I spent 9 days in the Amrey Sant Pau and can highly recommend it.The hotel is modern and very clean with quite basic rooms. Ours did not have tea-making facilities but it did have air-conditioning and a lovely view of the Hotel de Sant Pau next door.There was a fresh buffet breakfast each morning with plenty of variety.Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly. They helped us with our Catalonian and with bus and train routes and timetables as well as advice on restaurants, clubs and bars. They all understood and spoke English which was very helpful.The hotel is not in the centre of the city however there is plenty going on outside the front door. There are bars, restaurants and shops nearby as well as the Sagrada Familia Cathedral only being a pleasant 10 minute walk away. There are very good bus routes from right outside that cover most of the city as well as the Metro being only a 5 minute walk away.I would definately recommend it to anyone intending to stay in Barcelona.

<Content>Better than most 3-stars This hotel is better than most 3-star hotels and even some 4-star hotels at which I have stayed in Europe. The hotel is very clean and the room is comfortable. It is not a luxury hotel, but it meets the basic needs. The TV has CNN and BBC. I found no noise problem. It is a couple of blocks to a Metro station, and within walking distance to the Sagrada Familia. There are various restaurants in the area. The front desk people all wear business suits, and are professional and courteous. Barcelona is a great vacation destination. I plan to go back during the summer when it is warmer and more festive.

<Content>Not bad I spent 4 days here last September.Rooms are spacious enough. Good location. However, very noisy. Hospital in the area and ambulances with sirens blasting day  night.Buffet breakfast was not bad, though don't expect to get eggs, bacon or sausages. Coffee dreadful.Staff: extremely nice and helpful.

<Content>much more then a 2 star Officially this hotel has two stars, I was kind of scared when I cameto Barcelona ( company booked this hotel for me), but then I realisedthat this hotel deserves more then two stars. Its new and clean plus kind of central. Clearly I can recommend this hotel. It is very simple but really nice

<Content>nice basic hotel This is a basic hotel of a chain of Hotels, a little outside the tourist hub, you need the underground train to get to many places, but that is easy and cheep and local cafes are much cheeper as its off the main throughfare. Our room was quiet as is was 6th floor with an internal window. The blankets were a bit old and the floor was tiled, but it was clean and staff were nice. Theres no real coffee at breakfast which is a first for me in Spain!

<Content>A nice hotel We stayed five days at the Amrey Sant Pau. The rooms weren't very big, not luxurious, but well cleaned. The staff of the hotel was friendly and helpful. Their English was good.In the taxi and on several other places the fact I could speak a few words of Spanish was helpful. There were many (school) groups in town, in the hotel as well. We liked that and had no problems (noise etc) at all.The breakfast buffet was good (pastry, several kinds of bread and croissants, several kinds of drinks, a lot of fruit, bread and tomato (you get that everywhere in Barcelona)). Because the hotel is not exactly in the centre of the city (10 minutes by metro to the Passeig de Gracia.. Guinardo was the best stop for us/from there a short walk to the Place de Catalunya) you have to be aware that the restaurants in the neighbourhood don't open before half past seven/8 o'clock.Near the Rambla it was much easier to find a place to eat at an ealier time.The best meal we had was at the Port Olympic. Like many Dutchmen we wanted to eat a bit ealier than the Spanish, but that was no problem at the harbour. Several restaurants were crowded with Spanish businessmen, drinking and eating something after their workThe Monastir de Pedralbes was very nice and peaceful, the Casa Batllo is a very nice Gaudi house to visit and if you want to see the Museu Picasso, you have to be there at quarter to ten in the morning, otherwise you don't feel like joining the queue. The Ribeiro (near the Museu Picasse) is according to us the nicest area in Barcelona.Returning to the airport, we took the metro to the Passeig de Gracia and then the train to the airport (look for the train-sign, not the R10-sign). We arrived within 45 minutes at the airport and it cost us 3,75 euro a person. The taxi drive on arrival day cost us 36 Euro and the drive lasted more than an hour. The streets are crowded in Barcelona!!!

<Content>Highly Recommend it This was my first time going to Spain and I was on a budget; however I did want a hotel that was decent, meaning clean and in a good location. I must say I got everything I asked for. It's only like 2 blocks for the metro (hospital sant pau) and just a 10 minute walk from La Sagrada Familia...very convenient. The rooms were impressively clean and what I loved the most was that the bathroom was spotless and to me that's very important. The only thing that was a little of a pain is that in the night time it's hard to grab a quick bite around there. I ended up going to a deli about 2 blocks away and brought deli meats and sliced bread..but other than that you definitely get so much more then you pay for. Don't think twice..just book it!

<Content>Fantastic value I have stayed at this hotel twice with my husband and friends. It is the best value for money hotel I have ever stayed in. If you are looking for somewhere not too expensive, clean and with all mod-cons right near the Sagrada di Familia then this hotel is the one. It is a 7 minute walk to the Cathdral and a 3 minute walk to the nearest Metro which takes 15 minutes to the heart of the Ramblas. Alternatively you can walk to Pl. Catalunya in 40 minutes which passes very quickly as the sights are so great.A true gem in a wonderful and beautiful city.

<Content>Reccomended Just come back from a 3 night stay at this hotel on the basis of the reviews here, and I can confidently recommend it to anyone who wants cheapish accomodation and is happy to stay a little out of town to get it. Location is actually fine, although if you're partying all night then it will probably cost you a bit in taxis! Since I was travelling alone and not planning to spend my nights bar hopping, the metro covered my needs perfectly; a 5 minute walk to Hospital Sant Pau station, and a 20-odd minute trip to the Placa Catalunya area with one change.Worth staying here simply for the excuse to walk past the magnificenly loopy Hospital Sant Pau on a regular basis. Also within walking distance of Sagrada Familia, of course.Staff spoke perfect English, and, while a little reserved, were perfectly friendly, although thanks to the quality if the accomodation I had no reason to discuss much with them!Room spartan but very clean, air conditioning worked extremely well. Bathroom had powerful shower and was utterly spotless. Only downside was my inability to get the exterior blind to open properly to appreciate the hospital on the other side of the road, but I'm willing to put that down to my own incompetence.Good cold buffet breakfast with all the standards and a bit more.In short, everything you would expect from a decent 2-star, but without any of the concerns you might have about cleanliness and attention to detail in some similar priced / cheaper hotels.

<Content>Excellent Great place, we went for a three night stay.. hotel very clean staff very pleasant ...food great.. comfortable room with a huge terrace great views.... .nice to sit and relax..the hotel is also just out of the way of the hustle and bustle of Les Ramblas,we didnt see any trouble and felt quite safe wandering around late at night. Only draw back most of the shops were closed on Sunday and Monday .so next time we go it will be mid-week.

<Content>Great location, friendly helpful staff - no complaints, only praise Myself, husband and a group of work colleagues had Hotel Amrey booked for us by an events organiser, I checked the last review before we left and we were very concerned that we were going to have poor acommodation. However, it was just the opposite. We found the staff very friendly and most helpful, they spoke English and could not do enough for us. The location was very good, yes it is situated on a corner of road junction but you would find it difficult to find a city hotel that isn't - the room was double glazed and we could not hear the traffic. We stayed on the 4th floor, south facing and we could watch the world go by. The breakfasts were excellent and above all the hotel was extremely clean and well kept and all facilities were modern and working. We would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone. Metro five minutes walk. Taxi's opposite along with bus stop - but we walked a lot - it was more interesting. I would say that this hotel is more than a 2 star and we have stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world and this is one of the best value for money city hotels we have used.

<Content>Would not stay here again We chose this hotel because it was offering rooms at a really good price over the Christmas period; and also because of the previous review, which was positive. I read that the hotel markets itself as a 2* hotel with 3* facilities. In our view, it was most definitely a 2* hotel and we would not pay the full rate (of more than 3 times what we paid) to stay there. While our room was spotlessly clean and the hotel is very close to the Sagrada Familia and the Hospital Sant Pau, it was too far away from the other tourist attractions and our request for a non-smoking room was also not honoured. However, those were the least of our problems. The hotel is on the corner of a busy road junction and while there was some traffic noise, it actually didn't bother us too much as it was drowned out by a loud electrical hum in the room, which made it impossible to sleep; that and noise from other guests shouting and banging on doors in the corridors at 4.30am!
