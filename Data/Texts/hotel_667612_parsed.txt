<Content>WOW factor First impressions were amazing and the villas are exactly like they look in the pictures. They are big, spacious, clean and definately have the wow factor. The pool is a really decent size with staff always on hand ready to help you. At the end of the road there are restaurants and some shops but this is not the main area of Seminyak. The beach is about 10 minute walk and the main area about 15 minutes walk (or the villas do a drop off service) but we felt that we had enough facilities to stay in Disini area and we loved just staying in the villa. The only negative I have is that I felt the spa facalities were overpiced compared to others in the area.

<Content>Disini is Heaven!! Disini Villas were even more beautiful than the photos and reviews suggested. When we decided to go to Bali I spent many hours researching places to stay as it was for our honeymoon. We planned on going to the Registry Office in Sydney then hopping on a plane to Bali. Then my fiance suggested we get married in Bali on Christmas Day. (We'd gotten engaged on Christmas Day last year). I am so glad he made the suggestion. Our villa was the perfect setting, and the support from all the Disini staff (Thanks Alfian!) made it the perfect day. We used Bali Weddings and Eni ensured everything looked beautiful. My fiance/husband and I kept looking at each other saying how amazing everything was, from the flowers to the photos, we had a magical day.But more about the villas. When we walked in I was blown away. The pool was bigger than I'd imagined, and the lush garden setting, with water features, day bed, sun loungers and umbrella made it our own little slice of paradise. We loved the outdoor shower, and the complete privacy the high walls gave us. The complimentary breakfast was really good, lots of choice, and the Balinese are up there with the French when it comes to making mouth watering pastries. The room service was excellent, and we'd highly recommend the Lobster Thermidore and the Seafood Chowder.The in room massages were excellent, and they're currently building Spa Villas at the end of the complex, for treatments only. The staff were amazing. Desak Henny and the other office/reception staff were so kind and helpful, and our villa was fully serviced every day by the great housekeeping staff. We've stayed at quite a few places within and outside of Australia and I have to say, Disini is my absolute favourite place to stay. We'll definitely be back. And, if you want a truly amazing place to get married, we would recommend it without reservation. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer!!

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful Disini Villas are stunning! I was very surprised at how beautifully and tastefully furnished they are. We stayed there for a part of our honeymoon and the staff were wonderful with us. As soon as we arrived they bought welcome drinks and a specially baked honeymoon cake!The villas are lovely and are exactly as per the photos. There was a turn down service every night around 5pm and the staff left biscuits on our bed each day. The bathrooms are stunning and the lounge / kitchen areas are all open air. We would stay there again in a heart beat!

<Content>Everything is Personal at Disini Disini is tucked away in one of the side streets of Seminyak and may feel like you are in the middle of nowhere if you are in Bali for the first/second time but it genuinly good value if you want to get up-close and personal. The beach is about a good 20 minute walk so if it the beach you are after then dont go here. This place is for private fun and has plenty of space with personal care. Good nice touch of personal care. It is about a 20 minute walk to downtown seminyak or a 5 minute taxi ride. It is about 10-20 minute taxi ride to downtown Kuta.Faboluos place if you want to get a touch of personal care and induldge in private party!!Ravind  Vinni - Sydney, Aus

<Content>Gorgeous Villas, didn't want to leave ! Disini Villa's were stunning. We stayed there for 3 nights at start of holiday in Bali and 1 night again at the end. The bedroom was lovely, the bathroom was the best we saw in Bali, the pool was perfect. We looked at many other pool villas around Bali and didn't see anything come close to Disini. ..esp for the fair price we got..There is no common resort areas, but that is irrelevant as you have your own resort within your villa. Highly recommended.

<Content>Can't say enough about Disini!!! I have to agree with all of the reviews for Disini - it really is a treasure to be found.We stayed for 11 nights and we did not have anything to complain about. I noticed in one of the reviews below that it was mentioned about the TV in the bedroom - we experienced the same, however we asked the staff if it and the DVD player could be moved - no problem. We went out for the morning, cam back to the villa and the TV/DVD were set up in the living area.We had friends who stayed a Bali Dream Villas who came around to visit and us and were immmediately impresed by the difference in the two. They have said that next time they come back to Bali they will definitely be staying at Disini.We are going back next year and are planning on spending three weeks at Disini - that's how great it is.

<Content>Wonderful Villa, recommend to everyone! We have stayed in Disini Villa for my honeymoon and I'm so glad that i make a right choice.The villa is so great and i would like recommend to everyone who prefer privacy with nice pool.It's new and the service is excellent and staffs are very friendly. We have chose the package with breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food is so much better than other restaurant in bali, very good quality food and good service. We even asked for the extension of stay until late evening due to our night flight and we get the free extension for that!!The downside is that there's only one bedroom villa and if you have a large family then u may want to consider other villas. I'm planning to bring my parent for the next trip and we would like to stay together, hope that they will build a larger villa with more bedroom. haha.

<Content>Superb We stayed at Disini in beginning av July 2008. We love the place. The villas are gordious with a very wide bed, our own pool and the staff is wonderful. The breaakfast is eaten inside the villa and have to be preordered the night before. But be aware of that you can mix their breakfast menus if you don麓t like the suggestions. You can eithter ask for the breakfast at a specific time or just call the reception in the morning and tell them that you are ready to have your breakfast. If you want to use their service to be picked up from the airport it cost 25 US, do you take a cab it will be about 10-15 US. Just around the coner, not more then 100 m from the villas you can find several good resturants, at good prices. We think that Ultimo was the best, don麓t use Mykonos It is also some good Japaneese places. To walk down to the beach will only take you ten minutes, but beware of the guys who want you to join some time sharing party. The entrance to the beach is at the restuarant Ku De Ta.You have to pass their security check, but the guys are very nice., We walked litte further, direction Kuta and mostly stayed just outside Gado Gado, where it is some small beach resturants where you can eat good food for just 2 US. The internet did not work good in the villa but it is a free internet connection at the rception. It is no problem to sit there, ask for coffe and they will be happy to serv you. The girl in the reception do speak good english but even better Japaneese. The staff in over all was very service orinted.

<Content>Highly Recommended - very very good The Disini Villa is terrific. I stayed in a 1 bed villa end June / early July '08 and was very impressed. This place is very very nice -spacious, beautifully equiped and finished plus the service was 1st class. The villas are located about 100m off one of the main shopping streets but far enough away to be totally quiet. Down a path you find all the villas, guess about 20 of them. Through your own door you find your pool area with a covered canopy bed to one side, 2 reclining chairs to the other and then the open air living area and bedroom building on the other 2. The pool is nice, not huge but sufficient - about 5x3m I guess, the garden is pretty and the overall impression is wow when you walk in. The living area is huge - you could get 30 people in there for a party no problem - it has a kitchen area with dining table and chairs plus a sofa and another couple of chairs and table at the other end. Inside the bedroom area again it is seriously spacious. This area is divided into the bed area and the bathroom / dressing area by wardrobes. The bed is a four poster with mosquito nets, nice TV, little biscuits laid out every night for you also. The dressing area is his/hers with separate wardrobes and washbasins - probably about 3m x 7m. There's separate shower, bath and toilet all with glass windows onto the garden at the side (not the pool), the furnishings are top class and the floors and walls are very nicely done in high quality tiling. There's a patio door leading out ot the pool. Overall this place is really very very nice, nice enough I kept thinking that I could happily live it in almost! Service was great also - breakfast whenever you wanted, I ordered mine one day at about 2pm - no problem! It was delivered and laid out by the pool within 15 mins. Negatives ? Really very little to fault, but if being really picky the pool isn't something you'll be doing much in the way of exercise in as it's a little small for that but just fine for chilling out in, the pool temp is a little on the low side - it isn't heated and you tend to lose the sun by about maybe 4pm as the high walls that give you privacy tend to block it out. Otherwise highly recommended and will almost certainly use it again if after a villa in Bali. Comparing to The Bali Dream Villa - I stayed in both - Disini is much nicer for the following reasons 1) much more convenient, you can walk to shops and dont' have to drive or get a cab 2) the villa is about 30-50% bigger 3) the standard of fittings / furnishings is much higher 4) you don't get eaten alive by mosquitos when you sleep at night as you have a mosquito net around your bed 5) the aircon is better ... but then it is about $100 a night more!

<Content>A Very Classy Villa We stayed at the Disini Villa for three nights at the very end of our Bali vacation, and it was the perfect place to unwind before heading home. The villas are new, clean, spacious, private, and elegant. We were thrilled with the staff and their desire to please their guests. Breakfast was superb, with the perfect choices each morning to get you started. Our in-room massage was excellent. The pool was beautiful, and the bed was as comfortable as it is picture perfect. We would certainly stay here again the next time we are in Bali.

<Content>Wonderful, so great, will stay again This hotel is Awesome. Its so nice. We got a great deal on expedia for $175 plus tax and it was so worth it. This is the second time we have been to Bali and by far the nicest hotel we have stayed at.The villas are really nice. We had our own pool, butler, free breakfast delivered every morning at the time we wanted etc. The mini bar is free and stocked daily. The villa has a large water cooler with fresh water which is great so you dont have to run to the store daily to get water. There is also a full kitchen if you want to cook for yourself. If not, the food is really good and reasonably priced at the hotel. My husband had a massage at the villa and said it was really good, and the price was very reasonable. We stayed for 3 days and did not want to leave! I have nothing bad to say about this place, and cant wait to stay again!Seminyak is a great little area for shopping and happening restaurants. Ku De Tah is near which is a restaurant and bar. Personally, i think it is a over rated, Los Angeles-ish, Hipster, overcrowded, overpriced etc! But if your looking for action, you will find it at Ku De Tah.We also went to Ultimo restaurant and found this to be way overcrowded. They herd you into this huge dinning area and seat you one inch from the next table of strangers. It has smoking allowed in all areas. It is in no way romantic if that is what your looking for! the staff is untrained and dont speak or understand English. Otherwise, the food is good and well priced.

<Content>Absolutely Perfect We've just returned from our paradise honeymoon and Disini Villas was just paradise. We've stayed at many 5 star resorts before and decided to go with this villa that was referred to us by a friend .... and for a fraction of the cost you would pay at a big name resort (ie. Bulgari, Four Seasons etc.) We have never experienced such incredible service before!!! All your needs and wants will be taken care of by their incredible staff. You will get your own private paradise here and trust me it is a paradise. The location is perfect too, since it's not smack in the middle of a loud tourist strip and close to some incredible beaches and shops. The private pool is just what every couple needs, trust me. A friend of mine saw our photos of the place and said it's straight out of a James Bond movie and someone else called it the pimpest place he's ever seen. I would recommend this place to everyone. Also I recommend the romantic dinner (privater dinner in your villa with a butler serving you all night, with candles and flowers in your pool and candles placed all over your villa). Have a great time!!!!

<Content>Luxury  As soon as you touch down, the limousine (only 2 in Bali) is waiting for you with the open and english speaker people. You feel part of exclusivity straight away. The villa set up is superbe. I have been 17 times in Bali and so far it is the best set up as a villa. Full of Korean and Japanase , it shows that is quite specific to cleanliness, and discretion. You can swim naked in the pool as you feel very very confortable. Free drinks (alcool and non) are always in your fridge. The location is beside the most exclusive restaurants so you dont need to go too far. A chauffeur is always near by to bring you everywhere you need.IN short: super!

<Content>Loved the massage Seminyak is always my favourite area and when i end up at Disini I dont have much expectation as there are too many villas opening every corner in Seminyak. But this time, it really surprises me after i checkin. The villa and the pool is in good size, not too big not too small, you know how some villas are so big it just create this emptyness and scary feeling. Something I must mention is their massage, i tried the Ayurvetic Massage, and i actually have no idea what it will like in the beginning. I really like the elbow stroke, and i guess the therapist skin is pretty smooth : so it does give a better touch! And the therapist actually coming into your villa ,which i found it very convenient, not like you have to pack your belongings and run to the spa centre.

<Content>Villas with a Taste Being a business person with tight schedule, I can only afford a short vacation (3-4 days) with total relaxation, privacy, services and good food. This clean, modern and spacious Villas will pick you up at the airport, check you in, and take care of your needs completely. It is a pleasure talking to the owner of the Villas who is a Canadian loves the Bali live style and his wife educated in the USA with a degree in Interior Design. This Villas has class. The rate is very reasonable and actually they are only charging a normal hotel rate for a luxury spa-villas enjoyment. I love the private pool in each suite that you could swim naked everyday.

<Content>Excellent Luxury villas! I stayed for five days in august this and yes, this is a fantastic place to spend a couple of days. I have stayed in several luxury hotels and I also workfor one and you will really not get disappointed here and I doubt there are better villas in Bali at this price. Just look at the photos and you will find exactly the same thing when you stay there. We had a standard villa that had everything you could imagine such as a huge king-size bed, a JBL Ipod dock, great swimming pool and a easy handled AC. I strongly recommend this place if you want something extra and if you have the money to spend. It鈥檚 also located in a great place close tothe trendiest bars and restaurants.We noted two negative things. The hotel has just been opened for a couple of months and if you are an experienced traveller you will notice some lack in service,not that they don鈥檛 want to serve you but that things could be faster and better organized. If you are a westerner you will probably get quite bored of the breakfast since you don鈥檛 have so many choices even if it tastes very well.
