<Content>Ideal for over night and early flights My most recent stay at Hyatt Regency, DFW was the best stay I have had there. Like all other times, this stay was so I could catch an early flight the next morning. Being on the airport premises, it takes very few minutes for the hotel shuttle to arrive at the gate.When making reservations, I paid the rate for a normal King, but when checking in, I was told that I had been upgraded to a King Deluxe; thus I was Suprised at the size of the room when entering it. the room has a 7 ft. couch and the bed had 5 or 6 pillows on it.Likewise, the bathroom was large. It does not have a tub, but a shower only. the shower stall is the length of a tub and has a stabble plexiglass wall half the length of a tub.This hotel has a restroom on the patio beside the pool which is very convenant for the guest.I have stayed there many times and will continue to do so in the future.GEW

<Content>Disappointed 1) My Gold Passport profile clearly states that I prefer a high floor - I didn't get that. 2) I was looking forward to a view of runways and planes taking off - we had a view of the parking lot. 3) One big pet peeve for me is checking into a hotel and having burnt-out lightbulbs in lamps, as was the case during this visit. The bulb was burned out in the floor lamp by the reading chair. 4) We returned from our day in Grapevine on Saturday evening to find the remainder of our breakfast muffin SMASHED and on the floor next to the bed...as though the vacuum cleaner actually ran over it a couple of times - very unpleasant! 5) The room never got cool enough, even though we had the thermostat down to 68 degrees. The humidity never left the room, and I would have loved to crack open the sliding glass door to let in some fresh air, but it is bolted shut. This was, by far, the worst hotel stay we've ever experienced at Hyatt or any other chain.

<Content>Great Hotel Ok -- its an airport hotel. The airport is far from most things in Dallas.Other than that -- which you knew already -- because it is the Hyatt Regency DFW (which gave it away) -- is a great hotel. Great rooms; flat screen TV. The shower may or may not have a door -- I wasnt sure if it was me or post modern.It was 135 per night -- and perfect for what i needed. If you have a car and need to use the aiport as base its a great hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel but you will hear some airport noise I booked this hotel through Priceline and got it for $45 a night. I arrived late and it called the hotel from a courtesy phone. It took about ten minutes for the shuttle to arrive. The shuttle driver was friendly. At check in I requested a room facing away from the runway and was accomodated. The room was typical four star quality and had a comfy bed and flat screen HD TV. The only thing I did not like about the room was the shower that was not fully enclosed and let in too much cold air.The restaurant prices were outrageous. Pancakes were thirteen dollars and some dinners were fifty. Bring muffins with you like I did because there is no place else to eat in the area.Although I did not face the runway I did hear some distant runway noise and traffic from the roadway below. Luckily it was pretty quiet from midnight to about five. By the way, parking is free if you get your ticket validated at the front desk and you pay when you leave the airport grounds.

<Content>A Good Hyatt Stayed here for business travel. Rooms were spacious and funky. My favorite, a BUNCH of lovely fluffy pillows on the bed! Bathrooms were nice, well lit, nice shower....also there is a little one cup coffee maker that saved my brain both mornings I woke up here. They also drop you a newspaper every morning.It's a little noisy from all the planes taking off, but I didn't hear a peep from the hall or rooms around me. Sweet flat screen television in the room as well. HUGE bummer, they charge you $10/day for internet access and then it wasn't even working properly while we were there. I took off a star for how blah the catered food we got there was, staff was nice but thumbs down on the meals provided.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! We just returned from a two night stay at the Hyatt Regency inside DFW. When I won the bid of $53 per night through Priceline, I had mixed emotions because it was inside the airport and I was hoping for the Westin. Honestly, it wasn't much of a hassle being in the airport after learning our way around.We checked in late Friday night with only about a five minute wait. It would have been longer but another check-in line was opened when the line began forming. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and felt I received the same consideration had I paid full price ($129 per night).The room was a nice size with a king sized bed, 32 flat screen TV and desk. There is a small balcony and the sliding door actually opens! (Emphasis on small!)The bathroom has a shower only with a glass half-wall and no door on the shower. I know that is the new spa thing, but I would not want it at home. Water splashes outside the shower, plus, it doesn't get warm in the shower! Shampoo, conditioner  bath soap provided was good, Portico bath products.A small, single cup coffee maker is provided along with enough coffee for three cups. There is a powerful hairdryer with probably the shortest cord I've ever had on a hairdryer, but it was ok. There's also an iron and ironing board in the closet. There were about 10 hangers and an extra blanket and pillow on the shelf.The bed. Oh, what a wonderful bed. I thought I had the perfect pillowtop mattress at home, but I was wrong. We slept wonderfully both nights. I believe there were three regular sized pillows and two king sized. All were just the right amount of fluffiness for us both if you used two pillows. Noise. There was none. It is hard to believe how quiet the rooms are when there are jets taking off all around you. There was one time when the TV was off and all was quiet and I heard a take-off. Barely. I was standing close to the balcony door at the time. Other than that, it was as quiet as could be. We had breakfast Jacob's Spring Grille our first morning. It was your typical breakfast buffet and had made-to-order omelettes. A bit pricey at nearly $50 with tip.It was a wonderful stay and I can't wait to stay with them again.Many Pros, including:Free self-parkingFriendly staffRemodeled roomsOnly one Con:Charge for internet access

<Content>Very close to DFW! This is definetly a nice place......and being newly renovated is a great thing.LOCATION-If you need a hotel near DFW Airport, this is your place. You can't get much closer. It's possible to walk, but the easier solution is the quick shuttle ride. We waited less than 10 minutes before we were at the hotel. (Please note that the GRAND HYATT DFW, also at the airport is on the airport train route and even easier).However, f you have business outside of the airport this would be a very awkward location.SERVICE-Very professional and crisp looking staff. You definetly feel like you are in an upper-tier hotel. However, I think I may have caught them on a bad night when they were very full. There was quite a line at the front desk. And when I called both the phone operator with a question and room service, I had to wait quite a while before someone answered. However I must say, everyone was very friendly and professional.ROOMS-Absolutely beautiful. One of the prettiest and most lush chain hotel rooms I have been in. I was very impressed. Very modern, but also warm at the same time. I think have have done up Marriott as far as the level of luxury. Gorgeous color scheme and a huge plasma tv. The bathroom was equally impressivve with beautiful tile work and lovely amenities.Only two small negatives:The towel quality did however seem a bit chincy (too thin) for such a nice room. Also, the bathroom lighting was a bit harsh.BAR-I didn't have time to stop in, but there was a lobby bar that was hopping for sure. It was gorgeously decorated and looked like fun!For an airport hotel, this place is great. Certainly not cheap but you are getting a very nice room.

<Content>Another Perfect Stay I love this place! My second stay, just as perfect if not better than the first. I was here for an entire week this time, the staff from my first visit remembered me, always impressive! The food here really is good... had to eat it for a whole week, so I got a pretty good sampling of the menu! What gorgeous rooms! I have been to Dallas again since this trip and I was pretty sad I didnt get to stay here on that trip (BOO!), since this is really a great hotel, even if it is by the airport. Surprisingly, there are a ton of great restaurants nearby if you do feel the need to get out some.

<Content>Beautiful but... First the good features...This hotel is so close to the airport. The interior is lovely. It is modern, sleek and so air conditioned. The pool, with both good and bad features, is clean and maintained well. The bell boys (is that the proper term?) are friendly and helpful. Despite being so close to the runway the rooms are quiet. They are also spacious and clean.Now the bad...They charge you to use the shuttle and the wireless. Both things that the average traveler want to use. The front desk staff is a bit cold and rude. When my keys REPEATEDLY failed to work they did not want to let me into my room, even with ID, as the room was registered in my husband's name. Seriously. They are responsible for the lousy card keys and for knowing who I am as I was right there on check in and they gave me a key at that time. If they wanted my name they could have asked for it. They wanted me to wait for my husband to come back from a meeting to let me in. I got mad and they relented but why make me get mad about it. Then they thought a fruit platter would make it better. The food is marginal in general. The pool has no bar service and is noisy with car overpasses and airplanes.

<Content>Great deal! Great hotel! We booked this hotel for the night before our Cabo trip. It was a great bargain through funjet that included free covered parking for up to seven (7) days. The rooms were great, beautiful decor and the small balcony in our room was awesome. We ordered a 12 pack of beer through room service and it was $72 (a little high but it's VACATION). After that we decided to go the bar downstairs. Had the Tuna and a few drinks, it was good! We swam in the pool, which was great and used the gym, I LOVED the gym! There is also a coffee bar downstairs, my husband got me a coffee, so I am not sure how much it cost. I was suprised that it was open at 4am, that's a PLUS if your leaving early.Overall I am glad we stayed at the hotel, the free shuttle runs every 20 minutes and it really comes in handy.

<Content>Nice looking This hotel has undergone an extensive renovation and looks beautiful. The rooms are very tastefully decorated. However, the A/C is noisy and takes a long time to cool the room. The sink drains slowly. The alarm clock looks nice, but is hard to set. If you need to stay at DFW, and can afford it, its certainly a decent hotel--but the renovations focussed on looks and not more practical items.

<Content>Comfy, clean hotel for a weary traveler I booked a room at the Hyatt last minute on Priceline and it was a fabulous deal. The room was clean and very comfortable. Room service was prompt, tasty, fresh and nicely presented. If I hadn't had a meeting (at the other Hyatt which looked nice but not worth the extra money) I would not have wanted to leave my room. It was such a comfy oasis coming off a plane. I would stay here again!

<Content>Great weekend getaway for the price! We wanted to get out of our comfort zone for Memorial Day weekend but still be close enough to Grandma's where Baby Girl was staying, just in case.... put in 4 stars on Priceline-Name Your Own Price, and we got a winner! VERY NICE room for half the rack price and staff was VERY FRIENDLY. The rooms are well described in other's reviews so I'll just add two negatives: the bed was made with FLAT SHEETS ONLY (the Hyatt can't afford to use fitted sheets on their highly promoted Hyatt beds?) and the shower was a half-door walk-in SHOWER ONLY (be sure to put down the bath mat!) so taking a bath is not possible. The room was clean, but we were surprised to see our neighbor's room service trays out in the hallway for almost 24 hours. Be sure to try the Bananas Foster for Two at Jacob's Spring Grille - it's huge and delicious, but don't get caught hungry enough to pay $7.50 for a chicken salad sandwich at JETT'S coffee shop! Use the coasters in the vanity area for a free dessert and an upsize Starbuck's to get more bang for your buck. Also, the breakfast buffet was very good (great omelettes and Belgian waffles), but O.J. is an exorbitant extra charge not included in the $15 price. The pool has towel service for a few hours, but once the towels rung out, you have to ask the front desk to send more. Don't forget to have your airport PARKING VOUCHER VALIDATED coming and going and if you have a tolltag, don't use the tolltag entrances - use the public only ones, or you'll have to mess with paperwork to get the charges refunded to your tolltag account. All in all, a great local stay in a convenient area to restaurants, shopping, movie theaters, etc. (we know the area though, so this wasn't an issue) and would definitely recommend the hotel for a variety of reasons.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed here the first night of our honeymoon before leaving for Hawaii. We were absolutely thrilled with everything about this hotel! We got the end room on our floor, which was really nice and quiet. It was clean, modern, and the bathroom was amazing, with black marble floors, shower, and sink countertop. The service was so friendly - room service was great! The hotel is conveniently located in the Dallas Airport, and is an exceptional value for the amazing room. It was such a treat and a relaxing welcome after the business of the wedding. The bed was so comfortable - down pillows as well as a down pillowtop matress. We loved this hotel and would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>Many positives, but a couple of concerns I stayed at this hotel two nights during a national junior high chess tournament. We did receive a special chess rate of $120 per night, so it was good value for the money.Positives: clean, comfortable rooms with flat screen TVs. It is fairly easy to get in and out of the hotel's parking garage. Be sure to have the hotel validate your parking card, and you'll save the $14 per day.Negatives: As one reviewer noted earlier, there isn't enough hot water in the morning when everyone is taking a shower around the same time. I also didn't enjoy paying $10.77 per day for Internet access. The two or three resaurants in the hotel are very pricey, so I didn't try them.

At the front desk there is a self serve computer to check into your flight, very convenient. They also have monitors that show flight statuses.

<Content>Superb Hotel I have stayed at other Hyatt's, and haven't been terribly impressed, but this property is exceptional. From the rooms - amazing beds, gorgeous decor, excellent business features, plenty of mirrors - to the STAFF! I have to single out my ABOVE AND BEYOND shuttle drivers Alex and Gary who carted me around for three days during some pretty bad weather, always with a smile and great attitude. These types of employees aren't found everywhere, I hope the Hyatt recognizes that and takes good care of them. I work in hospitality, and if I could I would steal the both of them away. You can't go wrong at this hotel. I was sorry to leave, and I am sure I will be back since my new corporate headquarters is nearby.

<Content>Hyatt Quality Upheld in Rooms, But Not Service OK let's accentuate the positive - these rooms are terrific. Large, well sound-insulated from the airport, beautifully decorated, newly renovated and those Hyatt beds really are as good as the publicity says they are. So why wouldn't I stay here again?Most people wouldn't probably go to an airport hotel for nine days, but I had a conference there for a week and then got snowed in for a couple of extra days. Over this time, the cracks really showed. I'll highlight (or should I say 'lowlight') the three worst:1. The housekeeping at this hotel was the worst I have ever experienced, and this shocked me for a Hyatt. There were two days when my room simply never got serviced. In addition:- toiletries were not replaced even when completely empty, whether left on the counter or thrown away. Even when I rang to ask that replacements be left the following day, they were not. My colleague who was travelling with me found the same in her room.- the towels, which I'd hung back on the rack to signify I was happy to reuse them, were laundered/replaced each day. So much for environmental commitment. And each day something would be missing - no face cloths or one less towel. My favourite was the complete absence of a bathmat for three random days. Slippery marble floor....fun.- after the first night, they would not leave me a room service breakfast card (the one you hang on your door) despite several requests both to housekeeping and room service. It was laughably ridiculous how many times I had to ring and request one and still there were two mornings that I had to go to the restaurant because I couldn't order in-room dining.2. The other key issue for this hotel is the food. Fantastic selection if you're there for one or two nights. But beyond that the menu is extremely limited. It looks like they have several venues but when you look at the menu it's just not that different. Tex mex, tex mex and tex mex. There's the odd 'other' option but it's just not sufficient for a Hyatt.3. At capacity, the hotel runs out of hot water. The snowstorm meant the hotel was full to the gills and I had a completely cold shower to wake up to. Again, not good enough for a Hyatt.While reception staff apologised when I raised these concerns with them, they did nothing and offered nothing. So to be frank I felt it was pro forma and not even slightly genuine. They had my platinum Hyatt membership number and have not followed up in any way since my departure.So to sum it up, and to be completely fair, I don't think you can beat this hotel for a night or two at the airport. The rooms are fantastic, and most people wouldn't be stuck there for as long as I was, so the food will probably suffice. But despite the cardboard smiles, I think the service and the housekeeping leaves way too much to be desired for me to give this hotel anything other than an average rating overall.When I book a Hyatt, I just expect better. Only the rooms themselves live up to the brand.

<Content>Easy stay at the Hyatt Regency DFW We booked a two night stay (March 14-16, 2008) thru priceline for a total of $122 including taxes, in town for a wedding shower. I was concerned about being inside the airport with ease of getting to the hotel and the parking situation (we drove in).We were very pleasantly surprised. The signage within the airport directing you to the Hyatt is very good and they plainly differentiate between the Hyatt Regency (by terminal C-where we stayed) and the Grandy Hyatt at terminal D so there was no confusion there. The parking is also well marked and very convenient to the hotel itself. The hotel was quite busy for a weekend with a large high school convention going on, so I had some concern about noise, but we had no problems. When we checked in I requested a room with a view of the runways so we could watch the planes take off and land. They accomodated us with no problem (even though we'd paid so little thru priceline). There was no plane noise and our room was right by the elevator and we didn't hear anything either night.The room was quite nice and as others said the fitness center was great. We would definitely stay here again.

They serve some of the best food I have ever had. This hotel has a long history of fine eats as I remember coming here 25 years ago when it was the Amfac Hotel and had a luxurious Easter buffet. Don't miss the fish dish with fingerling potatoes and spinach...sublime. The rooms are nice and the bed comfy and also it is surprisingly quite for being in the middle of the airport.

<Content>Perfert for an early flight! Booked through Hotwire for about $100 at the last minute when I needed to take the earlier flight home which was going to mean getting up at some horrible hour. Check in was quick and efficient. The room was beyond my expectations, the perfect size. THE BED...I could live in this bed, the right blend of crisp sheets and a down topper that you just feel yourself sinking into. Room service was delightful with the tortilla soup being superb. Everything was hot and fresh and the waiter concerned that we had every thing we needed. Although it is rumored you can walk to the terminal, the airport shuttle is quick, easy and drops you right in front of the outside baggage check of your airline of church.If only they hit a drive through starbucks on the way!

Located right on the DFW property, it is easy to get to by car, or is right on Terminal C, and is an easy walk.The Staff are EXCELLENT! I did not run into a single staff member that was not professional in every way. They called me by name when I made a phone call to ANY department, and treated me GREAT! ! ! The room was Huge! And it was very comfortable as well. I LOVED the flat panel big screen TV complete with Digital channels. There was an iPod dock, coffee pot, hair dryer, iron and board, easy chair, incredibly comfortable bed, and rolling desk and desk chair.The food was great and I ordered several times from Room service. This service was always quick and very good.I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone doing business in the DFW area. Free parking and free tolls in and out of DFW was a nice bonus.I LOVED THIS HOTEL and actually wish I was there right now.You owe it to yourself to give this excellent hotel a try.

<Content>Good Bet for Airport Hotel, especially on Hotwire Had to stay one night with my wife and two young daughters so we could catch a flight the next morning. As several reviewers have pointed out the rooms have been renovated and now sport a more modern interior. The rooms were clean, relatively spacious (not large but not cramped) and the new LCDs a nice touch. The beds were some of the best we've slept in while travelling. Sound insulation kept the plane noise outside down and the kids really enjoyed being able to watch the planes take off.Coupled with the super convienent location across from Terminal C and the fact that I was able to get it on hotwire made it a good stay.Only drawback was the hotel restaurant where we ordered the breakfast buffet, which was rather basic given and a tad overpriced at $14 per person (kids are half price or free). But then again when isn't eating at an airport a tad disappointing and overpriced?

<Content>Surrounded by Planes The Hyatt Regency at the Dallas Airport is a great place to spend the night if you need to be directly in the middle of the DFW area. Thoroughly remodeled, the rooms are nicely designed with contemporary furnishings, colors, and comforts. The bathroom is actually quite upscale, with the standard room missing a tub, but featuring a large glass walled shower. The room has a nice big flat screen television, too. I got a good night鈥檚 sleep in this hotel that is well insulated against noise from American Airlines mega hub. The only problems were a long check-in line, which I鈥檝e found at other airport hotels because flights are cancelled and the passengers pile in, and low frequency buses serving DFW. As an airport hotel in the middle of the airport (but not connected directly to the airport), the buses should run very frequently. Instead the routing means riders have to ride to multiple terminals to get to their flight, using buses that depart the airport only once every thirty minutes. Next time, I might choose to stay at the Grand Hyatt, which is connected directly to the airport, to avoid the buses, but I still appreciated the comfort design of this hotel.

<Content>Great Choice Stayed here on a Friday night. Had a week long conference downtown and a flight out Saturday morning. Very busy hotel, several banquets, etc. The hotel has two parking options, valet for $20, with unlimited in/out priveleges, and free self parking, in a garage, 50 yard walk from the entrance. Staff was excellent, from the valet, bellman, to check in, very smooth; waitstaff at dinner and breakfast was very professional. Hotel has five dining choices for dinner: room service, a steakhouse, sports bar, southwestern restaurant, and a 24 cafe. All seemed to be good choices. My room was on 13th floor, had view of runway, and balcony. Flat screen TV, and Granite and Marble shower were very nice. The bed was excellent as well. I think I was in a suite but for some reason I think all the rooms are large after the renovation. Breakfast buffet is better than average. $15 per person, but well worth it. Fitness center is open 24/7, but leaves much to be desired. At least it was free. Internet is $10 per day. Pictures on hotel's website are accurate. Nice Place, very convenient if using the airport. Probably to much of a hassle for anything outside of the airport complex.

<Content>Excellent weekend value I was traveling with my family and we needed a convenient place to stay at or near DFW on Saturday. I chose Hyatt Regency based on great weekend rate, the good reviews here and my previous good experience at the Grand Hyatt at Terminal D.The bus service from terminals on arrival was prompt and helpful; took only a few minutes from Terminal D arrivals. Staff was very courteous and prompt. We got a room on request at the 12th floor with great runway views from the narrow balcony (a sure hit with the 2 and 3 year olds). The room had two queen beds and the newly refurbished decor looked great. The beds were very comfortable and we got a great night's sleep. The bathroom shower had great shower head and good bath products; the floors had mosaic tile strips and walls had a nice textured finish; very high-end feel. The TV was an excellent LG LCD panel with plenty of high-def channels (a pet peeve of mine at many 'fake nice' remodels that have flat panels with bad SD signal).We ordered a full room service dinner, and although expensive, the quality of the appetizers and main course was excellent. One of the best room service meals that my wife or I have had.Our rate included a buffet breakfast, including made-to-order omelettes. Breakfast was also of very good quality. The only two negatives of our stay were a 15-minute delay in getting seated for breakfast (plenty of tables but at 10am on Sunday they only had two waiters on duty), and also oddly enough the buffet didn't include any juices so we had to pay $16 for orange and grapefruit juices.In all, the positives far outweighed here. Great stay, will stay again, would definitely recommend for a convenient overnight when at DFW.

<Content>Loved it..... We stayed here overnight to catch a flight out the next day and were surprised at how quiet it was for being located in an airport. The staff was very helpful and everyone, including the waiters addressed us by name. If the need arises again, we will stay here.

<Content>An oasis for marooned travelers We were marooned by our airline for the night, and stayed at the Hyatt Regency. The staff was wonderful! We had to wait in a bit of a check-in line with other airline passengers, and a concierge came around to chat with everyone and to see if we needed anything. He refilled the sippy cups of all of the kids in line (there were a lot of families on my flight), and tried to make everyone smile and laugh in spite of the situation. The front desk and bell staff were so nice, and our room was great. We had to request two pack-n-plays for our sons, and housekeeping brought them to the room and set them up immediately. We gave our kids a bath in the tub, ordered room service, and enjoyed a good night's sleep on high thread count sheets after a long day of travels. We were impressed with every aspect of our night there - these people really know how to pamper weary airline passengers.If you are ever stuck at DFW for the night, the Hyatt Regency is a great choice - practically in the terminal, and willing to roll out the red carpet for just about everyone!

<Content>Great Hotel -- Adjacent to but NOT IN Terminal C I stayed here on a layover at DFW. It's a great hotel. The only problem I had was confusion about how to reach the hotel. It is adjacent to, but not in Terminal C. You can either take the hotel shuttle from Terminal C or walk through a series of garages to get to the hotel. I recommend the shuttle as there are several sets of stairs to negotiate if you walk. If you're on the DFW Skylink, you'll need to exit the train at Terminal C - - either stop and then EXIT through security and go to where the hotel shuttles pick you up.The hotel is newly renovated and is very attractive. My room was large, quiet - - soundproofed, and comfortable. The Hyatt Bed is fabulous. I think it's better than the Westin Heavenly Bed or the Marriott Revive Bed. Service was stellar - - everyone was polite, kind and professional. The breakfast buffet in the morning was definitely a step above the usual.Other than having problems finding this hotel at first, I can't think of any negatives. This is a first rate hotel and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Hub of Activity, Great Convienience The Hyatt Regency DFW is one of the easiest hotels to reach in DFW and can be reached on foot by walking through the garages. While the location is great, so too is the service and level of amenities available. The hotel was recently refurbished and the rooms are very nice. Additionally, the hotel bar and food is very good and open late to meet your travel needs. The bar tends to have a very social scene, so much so that the hotel has an annual New Years Eve party that is well attended. Many rooms have balcony's and the hotel recaptures some of the glamour of travel in the days past.

<Content>Newly Remodeled Good Airport Hotel, Convenient Location Overall Summary: Good airport hotel with great newly renovated rooms and good value on weekends. Expensive food outlets, non-existent gym.Pros: Now just about completely renovated, it looks very different than before. The rooms are large and nicely decorated with pleasing modern colors. The bathroom is remodeled nicely as well. Flat screen TV features HD on some channels. Convenient location with free shuttle from DFW terminals with 5 minutes, or you can just walk across to Terminal C in a couple of minutes. Free parking, and the hotel validates the toll ticket required to access the airport. If you have a car, it is very convenient to access many shopping and dining areas within 15 minutes. Good service overall with the exception of just one annoying bellboy. Appealing outdoor pool.Cons: The gym is temporary at this point so it has two old treadmills, an old elliptical machine and two bikes. No weights except for a couple of medicine balls. They said it will eventually be better but perhaps still not much for weights. Wireless internet keeps disconnecting and costs $11 for 24 hours. Water pressure in the shower is low. Restaurants are extremely expensive. Coffee comes in a 3-cup pot minimum and costs $6, onion soup is $8, sushi rolls $8.50. Appetizers run $12 and up. Entrees $20 and up.Value: I stayed using a weekend AAA rate and it was $101 + tax. The normal weekend rate was $119 + tax. Given the condition of the rooms, it is well worth it.

<Content>Absolutely superb This hotel has trained their staff well. This is what service should be.The rooms (beautifully refurbished) are spacious enough. bathroom average but extremely clean.The standouts are the staff attitude and the food. we all know Airport hotels are for the most part, pretty bad. Not this hotel- believe me.Mr G's Restaurant in the hotel is an exception to every hotel rule. The food is absolutely superb, the service impeccable, the wine list absolutely first class. Only downside is, it is expensive BUT, do yourself a favour - eat there.Where will I stay when I fly into DFW??? Right here.

<Content>Nice Shelter from the Storm We had an unexpected stay at the Hyatt Regency DFW on Friday, March 16 due to the storm that paralyzed all the airports on the east coast. In fact, we we in flight to Boston and had almost reached Pennsylvania when the captain announced that we had to turn around and head back to DFW. What a drag! We were worried that once we reached DFW at 6 PM, there would be no hotel rooms left because of all the stranded passengers. But the minute the plane landed, we were on the phone to the Hyatt. There were no rooms at the Grand Hyatt, but we did manage to book one of the last rooms available at the Hyatt Regency. We were fortunate to get one of the recently renovated rooms (so recently renovated that the 'new rug smell' was quite obvious) on the 11th floor. We had a double bed room to accomodate my husband, 14 year-old son and myself. The room was great---the beds very comfortable and the sheets divine. There was no bedspread on the beds, just a white duvet with a kind of useless runner on the bottom--nice design but totally funtionless. The room had a big screen TV, free WiFi, and a small balcony overlooking the airport. It was fun to watch the planes take off and land (although we wished we were on one of them!) and the noise was minimal. You could hear the planes slightly through the thickly paned windows but it was not a problem. The bathroom was adequate, dark but with nice amenities. I know it's not a PC-thing to say, but I really hate the quality of light that the new energy-efficient light bulbs give off; it's more like a flourescent light quality---cold, blue and unwelcoming. The Hyatt uses these bulbs liberally throughout the room. The TV was great, except the movie we were watching quit just before the ending, due to a failure in the central system. Bummer, but they did not charge us for the rental (expensive at $13.99 per movie).The lobby of the hotel was beautiful, and the staff was accomodating and efficient. I really appreciated the cafe/concessions stand near the restaurants. You could get a quick something to eat or coffee with minimal hassle. We ate in the bar (which had a lot of energy due to all the hapless passengers caught in the storm) after seeing the restaurant's prices. Very high, but an innovative menu. We ordered Nachos (recommended), a Rueben (fine), and the onion soup (highly recommended). The margueritas were great; the wine was a skimpy pour. The ease of getting to the airport, the excellent staff and accomodations, make this an excellent choice of hotels if you are stuck at the DFW airport. Call early as it tends to fill up. I asked one of the desk managers what the difference was between this Hyatt Regency and the other Hyatt at the airport and she said, Only the spa and the prices are higher at the other Hyatt. Since this Hyatt is newly renovated, and if you don't need a spa, this Hyatt might be a more economical choice. We paid $159/ night which I think was high, because they were capitialzing on the situation, so I imagine at other times, the cost would be lower.Recommedation: Eat at the bar, get a window facing the airport to watch the planes landing and taking off, check quoted pricing; have fun!

<Content>Clean but outdated I stayed at this hotel for work. And trust me, I have stayed at tons of hotels for work. And I have seen a lot of ugly hotels, as well as lots of nice hotels. When I got in to the hotel I thought, wow, the hotel lobby looked brand new and clean. And I have to say that the employees were all very nice. But once I got to my room I could tell that the room was outdated. The colors, carpet, and furniture. But they do have new beds, which were really comfortable, and I did my routine and checked the bathroom, and it was spacious as well as very clean. So I was pretty pleased. The only thing I noticed was some of the pillows had some dark spots at the end that looked like dust or something. But thank god that there were more than two pillows, so I just had to pick and choose. The employees were very accommodating and made sure that I got my toothbrush that I had called down for. They called me half an hour after I had asked for it to make sure that I had received it. The second night I ordered from the room service, and I was really pleased because the food was yummy. The lady at the front desk said that they actually were finishing a renovation, which I really could not even tell, because there was no sign of workers anywhere. She said that they are redoing all the rooms.

<Content>Great One-Nighter! This hotel surprised me! The exterior looks old and dated, but once inside it's a very modern-style hotel! The check-in staff was great, and the beds were EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE! I only spent a few hours in my room, but I did get a good night's rest.The bar downstairs is really fun. It's a good way to meet people that are travelling as well. The food is okay, though.If you have friends that drive in to meet you, remember to have their parking ticket validated by the concierge to avoid paying the parking fee.If you have a quick overnight layover at DFW, this is a great place to stay. There are airport monitors by the elevators that can track your flight, and it's only a short walk to Concourse C where you can check in for any American Airlines flight, or take the free green shuttle bus called Terminal Link to get to any of the other four terminals.

<Content>No issues Stayed here on an overnight passing through Dallas, arrived late - 9pm.Short queue at check-in, but encountered a trainee so took a little longer than normal - which was surprising, as the booking was made via the Hyatt Gold Passport frequent stayers program.After check-in we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar and ordered some food.Unfortuanately the both meals were cold on arrival - faulty microwave? : )Sent them back, same meals returned 10 minutes later 'nuked' - not stylish - advised that we were still not happy, and the manager took the meals and the two drinks off the bill, and offerered a free take away pizza.The hotel seemed to have reasonable faciilties, but as we were leaving early the following morning did not have time to try out the gym and pool etc.Would probably give here another chance if passing through.

<Content>A week's sojourn at the Hyatt Regency DFW We stayed at the Hyatt Regency DFW in June for the National Forensics League National Speech and Debate Tournament. We were there a week, so we had more than enough time to sample all that this wonderful hotel had to offer. First of all, the lobby is lovely and spacious and we were greeted with a smile every time we went in or out of the building (which was quite often). Check-in was super quick and very friendly. We had a rental car (which I would highly recommend if you plan to stay here as a tourist) and parking was very easy. The front desk staff were happy to validate our airport entrance ticket with no in/out limit per day. Our rooms were just as I had requested, clean and bright and with plenty of room. I had my toddler with me as well as my student, and the bellman showed up very soon after we entered our rooms with the portable crib I had requested as well as a very thoughtful gift of Baby Magic products! We ate in the restaurant several times and found the food to be very good, with the breakfast and dinner buffets an excellent value. We also had room service twice, and found the quality to be similarly good. Quick delivery to the room as well! The pool is on the small side but very pleasant, and the rooms are so well soundproofed that you wouldn't know you were at the airport if you didn't look out the window and see the planes taking off just across the way! The housekeeping staff were so kind and accommodating of my daughter's nap schedule, which is not always the case. Just one tiny factor caused me to rate this hotel Above Average rather than Excellent, and depending on your needs may not affect you at all. The hotel really is right at the airport, which is terrifically convenient if you have a plane to catch (and I was grateful for the close location when we had an 8am flight home!), but not quite as convenient for sightseeing in Dallas or Fort Worth. The hotel is no more than 20 minutes from both cities in the Metroplex, and perhaps if I hadn't had my toddler's schedule to contend with it wouldn't have been a problem, but I felt that I would have preferred to be in a more central location if I was in town simply as a tourist. Overall, a great stay at the Hyatt Regency DFW and we felt right at home!

<Content>doesn't get any better I can't say enough good things about this hotel. From check in to check out everything was perfect. Staff was friendly and professional. Room was very well decorated and had a large flat screen tv as well. Bed was very comfortable and I heard no noise at all at night. Breakfast was delivered to my room exactly at 6:00 as I had requested. The gym was well beyond the usual closet with a stationary bike and I was actually able to get a good work out in with out having to go find a gym in town. I hope I get back to Dallas again soon, just to enjoy seeing a hotel actually run so well. This should be more the norm and not the exception, but my one night at the Adulphus prior to my night stay at the Hyatt was far more typical of being let down by inconsistant service . Maybe they should schedule a night at the Hyatt and see how great a hotel can be when the staff makes it happen. Keep up the great work!

<Content>good service, but showing its age Just back from a brief fly-in, fly-out overnight business trip at the Hyatt DFW. Service was good, including a convenient shuttle in the DFW traffic maze, and quick kiosk check-in in the lobby.The hotel was clean, but very dated. Decor in the common areas and rooms is not worn, but looks like the late '60's, early '70's. It's amost like they intentionally want to appear frozen in time. I felt like I was in an early James Bond movie.It's certainly convenient for business travellers, but also suffers from the captive audience aspect of high prices (steaks in the restaurant were $50+).I would go back if I had to, but not enthusiastically.

<Content>convenient, nothing special I sayed at the Hyatt Regency (not to confused with the Grand Hyatt that is also at the airport) for 2 nights, having early/late flights. The rooms are in need of renovation, wallpaper is pealing, bathrooms are old, but all was functional.Having paid $42 at priceline I figure it was a good deal- I wouldn't pay a lot more.The lobby and restaurant are all redone and the food was tasty. Staff was friendly and responsive.Driving to and from the Hotel is a little confusing, since it is right at the airport make sure you get your parking validated

<Content>Good convention / meeting hotel - quiet rooms - nice store. Stayed one night for a business meeting. Shuttle runs every 20 minutes from the lower pickup area - and takes 3 minutes to get to the hotel from Terminal D. Fast check in and I am not Preferred status with them.Room is recently renovated, you can tell by the difference in age of the door vs. the rest of the room. Very quiet rooms even though you can look out your windows and see aircraft popping up on takeoff. OK decor - big desk - has both Starz and HBO in the room - beds Very comfy - sliding glass door opening to a balcony you can stand on but not sit in a chair on - phone did not have a speakerphone which was annoying in this day and age - room was very dark with the curtains pulled across - nice shower but small - good iron / board in the room.Meeting rooms are below the lobby level - very big - very nice - ok chairs for sitting in awhile - ok food - staff very quiet but productive - Starbucks coffee and both Coke/Pepsi for refreshments - big bathrooms - nice overall feel.The airline departure board in the lobby is always a nice touch and convenient for travelers.The store in the lobby had both regular food / snacks and a big refrigerated case. Very friendly staff and I found a regular priced touristy item to buy. Room service was reasonably priced but I did not try it.Highly recommended for meetings from afar, but not for tourists.

<Content>Good Choice for AP Hotel My daughter and I stayed here 1 night prior to an early departure from DFW. I had viewed the previous reviews and was a little apprehensive but was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. From the outside this hotel is old looking and not very attractive. Once inside the impression was much better. We were at DFW and called the hotel to pick us up. The bus came promptly and driver was friendly. Upon check-in, the desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I had booked our room as AAA and so received a voucher for complimentary breakfast at Jacob's or the coffee bar (if you are on the run). The room was larger than most, (ours was across from DFW control tower), wierd views but what do you expect from any hotel at the airport. They stated the room was soundproof and it was. We didn't hear a plane all night. The room was clean and not unkept as previous reviews had said. This is definately not a family hotel but is very business oriented, which didn't bother us. We ate dinner in the restaurant bar. It was of course pricey but we didn't have a car to go elsewhere so I had expected that. All staff had smiles, and were very helpful when I needed to use the business center. Nice business center. The next morning we had our comp. breakfast and then walked to the front door to catch the shuttle to the AP. The shuttle was there waiting as they said it would be. I would stay here again for a 1-nighter before a flight. The Hyatt staff did a great job of making us non-business gals feel comfortable and welcomed.

Our room was very quite. The shuttle to and from the airport is very convienient and prompt. The lobby and bar/resteraunt area has been remodeled and is very nice. We had a good meal and got some good sleep. Great place to stay for a layover or before an early flight.

<Content>Ick! Contrary to what the hotel's own Web site may indicate, renovations are not done. The common areas (the lobby, restaurants and other parts of the hotel you see prior to check-in) have been refurbished, but the rooms themselves have yet to be. They are extremely shabby and not deserving of the Hyatt Regency name. The furniture was cheap and worn. The wallpaper was ancient and the doors and bathroom cabinets had been painted, repainted and painted again. There was no hot water in the tub, which was slow to drain ... meaning I was standing in 2-3 inches of water throughout my shower. The air conditioner was malfunctioning. There was a hole in the sheets. In short, this hotel was due for a makeover well before now. It didn't help that the desk attendant at check-in was very rude. He obviously had no desire to be there. Management at this hotel is either blind, or just doesn't care.

<Content>Why did I stay here again? The hotel had a snooty atmosphere to it. On the phone they were borderline rude when it came to the questions I had. Want a fridge for your one night stay? Well you have to pay for 2 days rental as their days go from midnight to midnight. No complimentary breakfast at all. The do provide 3 pouches of single serve coffee, but be sure to bring your own sugar as you are allotted ONE pack. On a note, the food is excellent. Just be prepared to spend. Try the Embassy Suites in Grapevine, it's much more pleasant and only 2 minutes away!
