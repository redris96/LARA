<Content>Stay away from this hotel Strongly advise against staying at this hotel.The pictures shown online do not match the hotel, staff are incredibly rude and unhelpful, hotel is dirty, rooms full of cigarette smoke.We arrived, checked into our room and when requested another room (non- smoking) were refused. Of all the hotels we stayed in Italy and some of them weren't so great - this was the worst.

<Content>Great location  We stayed one night at the hotel which is just 5 minutes away from the Santa Maria Novella train station. Lovely location along a stretch of shoping area and cafes. BUT there are lots of foreign touts of African and South Asian descent, making it seem a little uncomfortable at times but, it is an issue common to the Florence I saw as a tourist.The hotel staff was wonderful, when we arrived at 7.30 am, they allowed us to get the room early which was wonderful because the railway station had a colorful assortment of crazies and wierd-looking dudes asking for money or just staring you down!No complaints because the hotel met our short stay needs.

<Content>We can recommend The Palazzo Machiavelli We had an excellent short holiday in Florence and the Palazzo Machiavelli did a lot to make our stay a happy one. The charge for our four-night stay was very reasonable; the staff were attentive but unobtrusive; the room was spacious and comfortable, the breakfasts were ample with plenty of healthy options, the location is very central. While on Via Nazionale be sure to visit also the excellent I'Brincello restaurant at number 110.

<Content>Great value  We had a recommendation for Firenze to find a good location as it is not easy to get around. Travelocity had a great way to find the location which we determined to be near the train station. Location is good advice. We were able to walk with our bags to the hotel. An easy 5 minute walk, even with my wife's large bags.We wanted good location and we got it. Very close to everything we wanted to see and all kinds of great shops and restaurants. The staff was the best and very helpful for our first time in Florence. They helped us get reservations and recommended great restaurants.Breakfast was excellent which was an important meal since we seemed to miss lunch constantly.The rooms were not like a Marriott or Hilton, but then we didn't want that. This was a very old building with a lot of history which is very cool to learn. Just sleeping in that room made you feel part of it. There was some road noise which my wife complained about but then she has to find something negative.Overall I loved the place. We stayed 3 days and enjoyed it very much. We'll go back...

<Content>Good value and excellent location I have just returned from Firenze, and enjoyed yet another stay at the Machiavelli Palace. In fact, I've stayed there several times during the past few years and the staff treats me like family. Excellent location near enough to train station to be very convenient, as well as only a 5 minute walk to Duomo, Piazza della Signoria, Ponte Vecchio  other sites. Many restaurants nearby to choose from as well as other conveniences. Reasonable rates, especially for the rooms with view of Duomo and Palazzo Vecchio. I am already looking forward to my next stay at the Machiavelli Palace.

<Content>Great place to be The hotel is very close to the center and the station so that we never had to get a taxi and spend extra money.Taxi is very expensive and especially with traffic in Florence it could cost a lot to move around! At our arrival in Florence we walked from the station to the hotel and did the same when we had to get our train to Rome!Plus we were 2 minutes away from the nice market and close to the Duomo,historical places ,Piazza Signoria and shops!Staff was very friendly and helpful,hotel nice and clean..really worth the money we spent and saved!

<Content>Bad Experience Apparently, you give your key to the desk clerk before you go out so that they can turn the electricity off to your room while you are gone. Our air conditioner was not cooling the room, so we asked for maintenance. We were told it's as good as it gets, which was at 95 degrees F. We looked around town and found another hotel that would treat us better. As we were leaving the Machiavelli, the clerk said why didn't you ask for another room? I didn't think we had to.

<Content>Decent value for your money. My wife and I stayed at the Machiavelli Palace for two nights. Our initial impression of the hotel upon entering was not great. The lobby was dank and a bit on the smelly side. However, the front desk staff were professional and checked us in quickly and even made arrangements for us to visit the Uffezi for the next day (although we paid a handsome fee for them to booked it for us).Once we got up to our room we were fairly pleased with the newly renovated bathroom. The rest of the room however still needs updating. We needed to unplug the bar fridge in the room as it made a constant rattling sound that kept us awake our first night, We initially thought the sound was the air conditioning unit, but after some trial and error, we discovered the true problem.The hotel is conveniently located near the train station and within a short walk of the major sites.The Machiavelli Palace is worth the $80 per night we paid after booking through a Name Your Price deal on priceline, but it is not worth much more...

<Content>More than happy There were several mixed opinions from the reviews I looked at prior to booking. I went ahead and booked anyway, and was pleasantly surpised with what I got.When staying in an Italian City (or any European city for that matter) you can not expect the rooms to be huge! If you do, wherever you stay, you'll likely be disappointed. With that in mind...The Room: big enough to walk around, getting changed etc without bumping in to each other - that's all I need in a room, so great! Clean, airy, the aircon worked great, beds were comfy (I need 2 pillows to sleep and the hotel were happy to oblige with extra pillows) free safe in the wardrobe (space for clothes was not abundent, but fine for a few-day stay) and we had a balcony!!The bathroom: again, big enough, the shower wasn't huge, but the pressure was decent and it was warm (it succeeded in making us clean everyday - job done!) Hotel staff were friendly and accomodating. A little tip: learn a little Italian, doesn't have to be much, but make an effort and it is very much appreciated by all staff (this includes shops/restaurants etc)Florence itself was just fabulous! Food is great - as you'd expect. One thing to look out for, if you want pizza - go to a pizzaria. In other restaurants, chances are pizza will be made with a frozen base (this is always marked on the menu - look out for the *) Prices for ice-cream varies enormously! I got fleased for 16euro for pretty standard size cones, which we'd paid about 3-4euro each for the previous day. Ask the price before you buy! (in Italian if poss!!)The big bonus of this hotel for me, was the sun terrace! I know you shouldn't go to Florence to sun-bathe, but I was after some RR more than anything. We had the place to ourselves and could lie out on the sunloungers with a book...bliss.All in all, the hotel was ideal for our purposes - the location was great (although we did wonder around a bit too far and got lost most days - ask for directions to the station and people will know where to direct you - again, ask in Italian if you can) My only complaint was the holiday was too short!

<Content>Great Balcony The lobby of the hotel is small but clean. It was really easy to find and very close to the train station. It had many restaurant choices right around the hotel and was in close walking distance to many of the sights one may want to see in Florence. The elevator is also very small but was standard for many of the hotels we stayed at in Italy. When I opened the door to my room, #501 I thought it was a little small. I had a single room and I was expecting it to be small so I was ok with the size. It was clean and comfortable.And then I opened the curtain. What did I find? A huge balcony that was larger then the room and had a fabulous view of the city and the Duomo. The room could have been 10 times worse but the balcony would have made up for it. If all you need is a single request room #501. The balcony had a little table and chairs set up on it so that I could just sit outside and overlook the city. Other then that, everything else was average. Breakfast was all right and the staff was very nice. I would recommend this hotel to my closest friends. It also had a great price tag :)

<Content>great location.....small room We were able to walk to/from the train station with no problems being only a few blocks away. The location of this hotel was excellent. We kept our map with us at all times but was easily able to navigate our way around stopping to ask for directions any time needed. People were very friendly. We did take a morning guided walk of Florence that I recommend doing as it helped us with our berings and was a very efficient way to see the big sights and also the David at the Accademia Gallery which is well worth seeing. We took a bus up to the top of Fiezole which was a nice view of Florence and also to Michelangelo Piazza on the far side of the Arno River and that was well worth the short bus ride. Del Vechio bridge was fun and I would have spent more time exploring this side of the river. A wonderful atmosphere day or night and felt safe most of the time......sometimes we ended up in some darker alleys by accident but no problems. Food is expensive but we found some nice finds in the outdoor market for dress and leather coat.My daughter loved it as a fashion major!! The hotel was adequate and clean and we couldn't beat the location.

<Content>Good location with some renovation needs. Machiavelli Palace was the last stop of our honeymoon after Paris and skiing in Livigno. We stayed there between 30th Dec - 6th Jan 2006. Since we got there in the last two days of the year, the room was a bit pricey (150 euros per night) considering that the hotel is not very modern and the furniture is slightly worn down.The pluses of this hotel is its central location: close to railway station, there is a open market just round the corner, cheap internet access round the corner, Via Nazionale has good restaurants and you can be in the historic centre of Florence within minutes. If you plan to get out of Florence to go to Pisa, and Siena for ex, it is very convenient. I agree with most of the reviews re; the interior of the hotel. It is in need of renovation. But it was clean and the breakfast was good and abundant. We actually enjoyed brekafast because it was not so common to find such an abundant breakfast in Italy.

<Content>Think you can do better Stayed here for four nights in September. We rented the Jr. Suite (195 E/night). First keep in mind that this building is from the 1700's. So we expected some dated features. But they note in their literature that it was completely renovated in 1990. Hmm.. almost 20 years ago--and it shows. Sorry to the others, but there really is no charm here--not when it needs so much renovation.Pros-Overall staff was very friendly. Room was large. Did not hear noise from outside. Location is close, easy walk to the train station (good  bad). Room was clean (though they did take my wine glasses from both rooms--never got them back--only inexpensive acrylic ones I bought to travel, but I've never had this problem before.)Cons--Ok, I tried to lead with the good, but I really feel that they are resting on their laurels. This place was a disappointment. Some depends on the room you get. Our friends also had a JR suite and it was better (though not luxurious.) Ours, however was in need of repair.The showers are about 24x24 inches. Really. It's hard for most people to shower in something this small. The bathroom is very small. Toilet, bidet, shower stall and sink. Very cramped--stand in the middle, and you can easily touch all elements without stretching. You do hear the plumbing from the other floors.Mattresses are very firm...some would say hard. The furniture was distressed. There was only one wardrobe for clothes--no dresser. I'll add pictures showing the damage to the furniture and the lovely contact paper lining the one drawer in the wardrobe.Our Jr. Suite had a large bed  a separate twin bed. Limited electrical outlets (I need to start packing a european plug since this is an issue in a lot of hotels.)Interior walls are thin, so while we didn't hear noise from the street, we did hear noises from the hallway (my partner actually answered someone thinking it was me talking.) Also got a lot of smoke drifting in from someplace. Not sure where, but it was annoying.The air conditioning is close to the door, while our bed was on the other side of the room, so our room never really got cool. Our friends' room, though, had the bed closer to the vent, so their sleeping section was much cooler (see, depends on the room.)The rooms have the lovely art that is typical in many Italian rooms--ours had the addition of a small but noticeable hole in it.Breakfasts ranked near the bottom of the ones I've had in the many times I've been to Europe. The coffee, when it wasn't out, was not drinkable. Juice was watered down. There is a bar right across the street where I would get coffee. No Biggie, but really not befitting a hotel calling itself a palace. :o)TV has one or two English channels-cable came in and out. (not that we watch tv that much, but sometimes it's nice to hear the news.)I tried to find the good--again, very big room for Europe and the staff was very nice. But the discrepancy in the rooms was startling...but none seemed that nice. After multiple times in Florence I feel that this hotel is taking advantage of the tourists . I much prefer Albergo Scoti--a one star pensione that at least has a better price/value relationship, along with charming owners.Bottom line, at about $270 / night, you would never put up with this in NYC. (not that you'd get a room this big for that price...but you'd never pay that for a place that really needed renovations.

<Content>Loads of character We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Machiavelli Palace. I think if you read the last few reports from people who have stayed at this hotel, you will get a very good flavour of it. In fact there were lots of good points, but a few not quite so good. Location is perfect - a 5 minute walk from the railway station, and near to all the main attractions. Others have reported a lot of room noise, but our room overlooked the centre of the hotel itself and had no view at all, but was very quiet. I think its probably fair to say that if you get a good view you get noise and vice versa! The bedroom was lovely and full of character - beautiful curtains seem to be a feature of this hotel - but the bed was so hard that I was on painkillers! (This might be me - I am very picky when it comes to beds and most hotel beds are too hard for me). The bathroom was small but adequate and clean, but the shower was the smallest I have ever seen. You stand in it and wrap the curtain around yourself. It is so tiny that if you drop the soap you have a struggle to bend down to pick it up. Other reviewers report that the breakfast is not very good, and they are quite right. But it isn't awful - just a bit basic, but enough to get you off to a reasonable start for the day. The receptionists were all extremely helpful and courteous. Probably the best feature of this hotel - besides the location - is its atmosphere and ambience - it had so much character. It is also worth taking a drink up to the lovely but very small roof terrace on the 3rd floor. As for Florence itself, you are simply spoilt for choice with all the wonderful things to see and the lovely cafes and restaurants. Not sure that I would bother again with the hop-on hop-off open top tour bus - there are really not enough buses and they are absolutely packed all the time - we never made it to the top deck. All in all a great trip with a lovely hotel, which could just do to make a couple of improvements to be even better.

<Content>What's not to love? The Machiavelli Palace is so closed to the train station that we actually walked passed it, not expecting to be there already! We were quite apprehensive as the hotel is in a very busy street, but once in the room, we were very pleased. We could not hear a single sound from the busy street as our room was facing a courtyard. The room is relatively big and equipped with a bar fridge and TV. The hotel is in walking distance of everything in Florence and there are a number of nice restaurants in close proximity. We found the hotel staff to be friendly and the breakfast was standard, but with a nice variety (including some cold meats and tomatoes). We enjoyed our stay and would return without thinking twice.

<Content>A Mixed Bag With a trade fair on in Florence at the time of our stay, accommodation was extremely scarce. The Machiavelli would not have been our first choice it is true to say, but on the whole was a fairly good choice. The reviews on this site are very mixed and that is because the Machiavelli is an old and somewhat weary converted convent and therefore has extremely varying rooms. Ours was fairly small with a window opening only onto an internal light well that seemed to be a receptor for all the daily Florentine heat. Therefore it became imperative to keep the window tightly closed at all times and covered with the heavy curtain to try and maintain some semblance of coolness. Unfortunately the airconditioner worked only intermittently so we relied on cold showers to keep us cool! On the plus side the bed was comfortable. The breakfast was very ordinary indeed and the coffee was almost undrinkable (very unusual for Italy). As reported elsewhere, the hotel is very close to the Termini which proved invaluable to us as we were travelling by train. On the other hand, returning to the hotel late in the evening had us walking down gloomy roads that felt unsafe. We thought it good to have internet access available downstairs if required. The front desk staff were generally cheerful and helpful. We were disappointed in the hotel's attitude when we had to leave a day early due to a train strike - having given them two days notice of our intention they would not refund even part of the money we had paid for the room for that unused night. Would I stay there again? Probably not.

<Content>Fine if you don't mind noise! If you like your sleep and comforts do not stay here! Although the staff seemed friendly and the room was a nice size (although I think we were just lucky!) the hotel did have its faults. A double bed is really two singles pushed a little closer together. The mattresses are so hard sometimes I felt like I was sleeping on the floor! The windows are not double glazed so be prepared to hear everything going on outside - even conversations if you understood the language! On our first morning we were woken up to a few women having a very loud conversation outside our room in Italian - I'm not sure if they were staff or guests but the conversation/shout went on forever! You could hear the person sneeze in the room next door. The noise of the plumbing was unbelievable. Breakfast was fine, same as anywhere else in Italy really. Having said all that, the location was great!

<Content>Very Enjoyable Stay We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of a 2 week vacation.Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, assisting us with reservations for the galary and providing directions, etc. Hotel was clean, everything worked and morning breakfast was very good. Located only a couple of blocks from the train station and in the heart of Florence, it made exploring the city on foot very easy. Only complaint was that the beds were very very hard - they looked more like cots than beds. We found great restaurants and bars in Florence, the leather goods are bountiful as well. Would highly recommend the Hop on / Hop off bus tour - great way to orientante yourself with the city.

<Content>a little gem It was quite difficult to find a suitable room in Florence as we were on a short break with our 14 yr. old son. I trawled Trip advisor and finally settled on this one.The position could not be better when arriving by train - literally across the road and around the corner.Our room was ready at noon and we were delighted when we were given the room which had been displayed on the hotel web site. They claim this is the only suite in the hotel, and while I maybe think it's stretching it to call it a suite, it was certainly a lovely old Florentine room with stairs up to a little nook with flat-screen tv, sofa, and fridge. All in all teenage heaven!The shower room was small but functional and cleaning always took place in the morning.The breakfast room gets quite crowded but is quite adequate. Coffee is disgusting - take my tip and order espresso at no extra charge, making it into americano with the hot water.The receptionists were very helpful with restaurants, shopping etc.There seemed to be quite a variation in rooms, so ask for another if you don't like the first.There is a pleasant little terrace on the third floor wher you can flop after a hard days sight-seeing.Definitely a little gem in a very expensive city!

<Content>Very enjoyable stay at the Machiavelli Palace This hotel was part of what made our stay in Florence so enjoyable. The room, though not large, was beautifully furnished, and we had a small balcony that looked out over the rooftops of Florence. Most lovely. The location is good - 2 blocks from the train station and close to the sites. The staff were generally very helpful. The breakfast was not the best we had in Italy, but more than satisfactory, none the less. Any complaints? Well, the plumbing was a little noisy on occasion, though that was not a constant thing, and it is a very old building. The one small elevator and the equally small lobby created problems for some when several people (with lots of lugage) were trying to check in or out all at once, but it was never a problem for us. We would certainly go back to this hotel again.

<Content>Fine, except for noise Stayed at the Machiavelli Palace last week and received a great deal through the British Airways Holidays website.The location of the hotel is as good as everyone says it is. It's five minutes from the S. Maria Novella Train Station and one block from the Florence Markets (An absolute must, as the food selection is incredible). It's an easy stroll down to the Dumo (with's it huge Dome), Uffizi, Pitti Palace, Galleria dell'Accademia and Palazzo Vecchio.My room had a view facing towards the Dumo and was clean, comortable and well maintained. The rooms come with mini bars, direct dial telephones and a desk. The shower was very small, but functional. My only criticisms of the hotel was the wafer thin walls between the rooms, which resulted in me hearing the occupants of the room next door. Whilst the the windows are soundproof and block out the road noise, it's a shame the walls weren't given the same treatment.Also the staff could be better trainined in customer service standards. The luggage porters were friendly, but the other front office staff seemed distant and reluctant to help. Not a huge issue though, as I was out of the hotel for much of my stay.

<Content>Simply ideal! The hotel rooms are fantastic, with brand new gorgeous antique florentine style furniture, curtains, painted walls and wood ceilings. The staff is very helpful, breakfast just the adequate buffet sort. The location is absolutely ideal, a few steps away from the pedestrian old town, yet easily reachable by car (and they come and pick up your car and bring it back to you when you leave for a very reasonable price). I just can't believe it is so cheap for such a deal!!! We paid 530 euros altogether for four adults in two rooms, a car, all for three nights with breakfast included, in the most exquisite rooms and location. One of the rooms opened onto a little courtyard, the other onto a side street, but even on the main street, the windows are perfectly soundproof and the hotel amazingly peaceful.Only reproch: they change ALL the towels and pillows everyday, which is of course very pleasant, but they could save the planet by asking customersd if they really need them all changed.

<Content>The tiniest bathroom in the world As independent travellers the hotel's location to the train station is great. A 2 minute walk around the corner and the hotel is there. The hotel is in a good location for walking around Florence and a visit to the market is a must. There are a few bars and restaurants around.The hotels reception area is small but clean and inviting. However our room was a very much a disappointment. The bed was very, very hard, the furniture had seen better days and the bathroom was the smallest bathroom we've ever seen. It can't have been much more than 2ft x 2ft and within that space was the toilet, a bidet, sink and shower. The bidet faced the toilet with about 6 inches of space between and the shower was like no other ever seen. The base of the shower folded away and once fully asembled on the floor there was a poor shower screen that was supposedly attached to the base that pulled around. The shower screen didnt fit so ultimately the tiled floor became a danger zone. The plumbing was very noisy. Florence was surprisingly warm for Dec but the air conditioning unit was very noisy and very poor and did nothing to stiffle the heavy air. The room didnt have much ventilation even though there was a balcony (the only plus from the room was the view from the balcony and the bathroom window!). Breakfast was very poor: tinned fruit, hard croissants and concentrated fruit juice made a very unappealing start to the day. However a good cafe across the road sold delighful pastries. The lift had seen better days and could really do with a service. If you're not looking for a comfortable bed and don't mind poor bathroom facilities then this hotel will be for you, but if you want a few home comforts then I'd suggest pay the extra and go for a 4 star. Its only the location that gives this hotel the 3 star rating.

This old 3 star had clean big rooms, good breakfast but was a little noisy ( tile floors and very noisy plumbing) but otherwise fine and good value. Very near the Duomo - less than 10 min walk and in what would appear to be a safe area.

<Content>Lovely old-style rooms After a short stay of four days at the hotel, and after having read some of the reviews posted here, I just wanted to shade the description by some remarks. I do not agree with the quality of the breakfast, which is according to me, fine but not wholly satisfying (no hot chocolate, no eggs, no fresh juices). The situation is also good, close to the train station and the market, San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Novella, but it is not the best or most charming part of Florence. My main source od satisfaction remains the big, rich and confortable rooms, with one bed and a smaller one, big furniture, and kind and nice employees at the desk. A good choice anyway.

<Content>Location Location Location My husband, daughter  I spent 4 nights at the Machiavelli in April, 2006. Room was certainly adequate in size. We were above the street, which we thought was marvellous - looking down on all the local goings-on. Noise not a problem. I would classify the room as reasonably clean - not the best, not the worst. Shower was a shocker. You had to either hold the shower head in one hand while you showered (tricky if you're washing hair!), or else get down on your hands and knees to actually hop under the shower spray - the shower was in the bath  the head was anchored about a foot from the base of the bath. Need to shut the bathroom door at night because of the bad smell - this only helped a little. Call that a hair dryer? More like a puff of hot air. Speaking of hot - we could not adjust the heating in our room  it was like a sauna. Staff most unfriendly - in fact, the least friendly  helpful of anywhere we stayed on our tour of Europe. Could not even raise a smile. Breakfast was just average. The only saving grace of this hotel is its location. It's just fabulous - so close to everything you want to see and do. And you can walk from the train station with your luggage. I would not stay here again, but would certainly look for another hotel in the same vicinity.

<Content>loved the front desk The front desk found a doctor on a Sunday morning who came to the hotel and prescribed medication for my husband which relieved the painful back spasms he was having. We were able to use our reservation at the Uffizi that afternoon. For other easier assignments they did just as well and were always pleasant.

<Content>Service iffy While this hotel met our needs during a recent 3 night stay, the service wasn't great- it wasn't TERRIBLE but the 2nd day they just plain forgot to make our bed and do up the bathroom. Not a HUGE deal for us but still sort of annoying. The front desk was good about wakeup calls and the breakfast was actually pretty good. The location was good- right near the train station. Florence isn't that big anyway so it was a quick walk to everything. It served our needs but didn't really leave us feeling warm and fuzzy. If you are looking for a clean room to stay in without many extras, this hotel will be fine for you. The shower spewed hot and cold water almost schizophrenically- and there was very little counter space. Again, you have to decide if these are big deals for you...if not, this is a fine place to stay. They even had a flat screen tv for us to watch italian soccer on! :) Overall, an OK hotel- not super, not horrible. If you are looking for a place to crash, and will be out all day, this hotel is fine for you. Beds were comfy, and the place didn't smell. I would look for a different place next time, if only because of the service inconsistencies.

<Content>The Machiavelli Palace is in a great location. Located only about 3 blocks from the Train Station and only around the corner from the Florence Flea Market you cannot beat the location. There are however a few things I'd like to point out. While it used to be a Palace, it has since been a convent and now a hotel. The rooms are very small and the walls are thin(you can hear people coughing next door and you swear they are in your room). The hallways echo loudly and our room was located above the kitchen so we heard the compressors all night. Also, at breakfast time you could hear all the dishes clattering from the Dining Room. No need for an alarm clock. The staff was very nice and helpful but they do have a few things there that need to be corrected to make the visitors stays more enjoyable. Probably would not stay there again but stay in the same general locale. The breakfast was very good there though. Janis MFt. Lauderdale

<Content>Great Location  This is a great tourist/budget hotel! It's literally a few minutes walk from the train station. If you attempted to take a taxi, you would laugh at close it is. It's a very short walk to Duomo and each morning the street vendors set up a street or two away so you can easily do your last minute souvenir shopping in the morning. The staff was friendly. The breakfast standard. The rooms are very charming and bathroom sufficient. Note that showers tend to be small throughout Italy. That's to be expected. When you travel, you need to leave The U.S. or your country behind. Remember - other countries have different standards. Our room had a queen size comfortable bed. Bathroom included a hair dryer. Hand towels and towels were provided, but no washcloth. Hotel isn't overly fancy, but if you're looking for a nice, comfortable, safe, good location hotel to spend your sleeping time, then this is the hotel for you! I would definitely stay here again if I ever make it back to Florence.

<Content>2 Thumbs Up! We were very pleased with this hotel! Although not extremely fancy, it is a very clean and well taken care of hotel. The staff was exceptional as they were friendly, took care of our every request....including car parking needs (actually took/picked up our rental car to/from the garage when we needed it), and one of them (think he might have been one of the owners) actually gave some really great Tuscan countryside sight-seeing advice. The room we had on the third floor towards the back end of the hotel was of good size and perfect for our needs (yes the shower was the only problem as it was the typical european setup  small with one of those detachable shower heads that tend to squirt all over the place). On a side note, as someone else here noted, some of the rooms do look to be very small (according to the fire escape plans on the wall) and oddly shaped, especially on the hotel's sides near the main stairwell. Great location, everything within walking distance (get ready to barter for that new leather coat...merchant's square one block away), the Uffizi, train station, and on and on ...and a nice pub at the end of the street to the left of the hotel.

<Content>Nice surprise Booked thru Virgin Tours sight unseen. Nice surprise. Easily walkable to train station. Next door to outdoor marketplace. Short walk to Duomo cathedral. Short walk to David Statue. Hotel was clean and simple. Room with street view. Safe neighborhood. Breakfast hearty continental. Bathroom clean. A good value.

<Content>Great little hotel This was part of a very economical Virgin tour package so it was a bit of a crapshoot but I was very pleased with the choice. The shower was eensy but i didn't live in the shower so it's a moot point.the staff was very helpful and friendly, but the breakfast - not so much. we ended up eating at this great little cafe right across the street. the train station is literally a five-minute walk, it's convenient to the Duomo and other sites and it's in a charming little neighborhood.It's not a hotel to swoon over, but perfectly wonderful and comfortable. I'd recommend it wholeheartedly for anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay in a convenient location.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Very Convenient Location I thought this hotel was a step above for a 3 star. The hotel and our room was very nice and clean and felt relatively new. The location could not be beat as it was very close to the train station, shopping, and sites.Bathroom was very clean but small and smelled bad until I poured some water in the floor drain as the trap was apparently dry. After that it was fine.Breakfast was standard fare but good. From the fire escape map posted I could tell room shapes varied and sizes varied. Ours looked to be about average and was placed next to a varanda on the 3rd story looking over tiled roof tops. Very nice...

<Content>Comfortable and good location Six of us enjoyed a three day break at this hotel. It was very close to the station and market. Rooms were comfortable and clean although the showers were very small. Our room looked onto the courtyard and was quiet and restful. Breakfast was disappointing, contrary to what others have said, with tinned fruit poor quality cereals and orange juice, UHT milk and lukewarm tea and coffee. Despite this, we would recommend this hotel for it's location, friendly staff and value for money.

<Content>Great Location I stayed at the Machiavelli Palace for 3 nights. The hotel is located just around the corner from the train station and is also within walking distance of the Domo, Uffizzi and is about 20 minutes from the River Arno.I was very impressed with this hotel. The front lobby and breakfast room were nicely decorated with lots of antiques and frescos on the walls. The front desk staff were very helpful.The room was also nicely decorated and included an ensuite bathroom, mini fridge and flat screen tv. The continential breakfast was great! I was impressed with the variety of breakfast items that included bread, cheese, meats, fruit, yogurt, orange juice, coffee, tea and sweets.The only reason I would not rate this hotel higher is because of the noise from the street below. Out of 3 nights I only had one night of uninterupted sleep. I really hate to give this hotel such a bad rating because it was really good - if you decide to stay here, please ask for a room on the upper floor, and one that looks out over the court yard, not the street.

Breakfast was great. The desk people weren't the friendliest but they weren't rude either. All and all we were quite pleased. Of course when we stay at three star hotels that is what we expect.

<Content>Fantastic long weekend in Florence I stayed in Florence for a long weekend with my mum. It was a last minute deal through the internet. We arrived at the hotel two hours earlier than our check in time. Although we couldn't check into our room they immediatley put our luggage into safe keeping so that we could go off and start our holiday. The hotel is so close to the train and bus station which was great as you didn't have to carry luggage far and no need for taxis etc. It really is only two minutes away.Once we checked into our room, we were really pleased. We had a nice sized twin room with a large window. Both the room and bathroom were spotless and were cleaned thoroughly each day, the bathroom was sparkling clean. We could not fault the staff, we found them absolutely lovely.I do understand about previous comments about the smell from the bathroom. late at night there does appear to be a nasty smell from the drains. I have found that in other old cities this is often the case late at night because of very old drains and can affect many hotels when the toilets are not being flushed regularly at night. In the daytime, the smell seemed to disappear, just make sure you keep the bathroom door closed at night.The famous sights really do start just around the corner. I can see why people find it a bit scary near the hotel at night. However, we live in London and it did remind me of Londons Soho but on a much smaller scale and once you get used to it you realise its just a busy area and people are just going about their business in a busy city. For a three star hotel we were completely satissfied, the standard was much higher than a three star hotel in England which is why we have given the high rating. It was more than we hoped for. If you want better quality then I think you should go for a higher grade hotel and expect to pay more. To be honest if you are out looking at the sights all day then you are not going to spend much time in the hotel but its nice to have a nice base and a comfortable bed to go back to. We were more than happy.We loved Florence although we didn't find the local people friendly at all, they can come across quite rude. We decided not to let this ruin our holiday as there is so much to see and do and we had a nice hotel to go back to. We would recommend a restaraunt just around the corner from the hotel next to the fish restaraunt. Its wooden on the outside and a very traditional small family run place. You might have to wait for a table. The food is great. Unfortunately we can't remember the name of it.We hope you enjoy your trip as much as we did.

<Content>Very pleasant!!! I was in this hotel last March from 7 to 11.This was the first time that I visit Florence, and now I can say what I knew, it麓s beautiful and unforgettable and very easy to see.I was five days and I could see the city very good but I recommend four or five days minimum or a week if you can and if you like an arts city like this; in two days you can see Florence very fast what is strictly neccesary of course but you need more days to enjoy the city and belong to it.I麓d like staying for five days or more in every city I visit to see everything with calm that麓s my opinion.Well, I stayed in The Machiavelly hotel (3 stars), in Via Nazionale 10, very near from Sta Maria novella station.It麓s a good zone with many shops of everything you need and many shoe shops too.The hotel is at the begginning of the street because Via Nazionale is very long.The hotel is next to the corner of Via Faenza, a beautiful paved street to go for a slowly walk and at the end of Via Faenza you are in front of the capille Medicee.脥t麓s about 3 minutes walking.The hotel is very near to San lorenzo market and the Duomo too, but everything in Florence is in a short walk.The hotel was an old convent but it麓s restored. It has a small hall with the reception, the lift, the stairs,and the access to the breakfast room.It麓s a big hotel through it doesn麓t seem, with long and labyrinthic corridors.Our room was in the first floor and was inner with views to a courtyard but it didn麓t matter to me because the street is now under construction and noisy.The room was small but nice and cute, I could see another rooms and there were very big and beautiful rooms too.The room has a double bed with two little tables, a beauty wooden wardrobe, a beautiful golden mirror, a little desk, a chair , a tv and a little fridge.Everything little but very good and very clear, anything broken.You have your own heating too to up or down the temperature .The bathroom was little too but with everything you can need, a big mirror, shower , hair dryer, any problems with the hot/cold water or the pressure......and the most important thing, very clear too so in general we were very confortable.The breakfast room has many tables, you have a buffet service and very complete, coffee, different teas, cereals, yoghourts, sweet stuff, jam cheese.....so the moment of the breakfast was a pleasure too.You can repeat what you want.The stuff of the hotel were everybody very pleasant except for a red hair woman and a young boy at the reception but this wasn麓t a problem.There is an old man which is very nice so....Well in short, beautiful city , very good people, good food and very good and cheap hotel.I paid for flight and hotel 375 euros.We had a sunny weather so what can i say more?? I hope to visit Florence soon again , I can麓t forget it now and of course I will stay in the Machiavelli hotel.Best wishes.

<Content>Nothing memorable but no complaints Close to train station, basic room, nothing too fancy. Many hotels in the area. Lots of places to grab a bite, even a McDonalds for those wanting it. Easy to walk to most places in Florence from here. Also easy bus system - get a free map at tourist info across from the train station. The place was clean  comfortable. Good reasonably priced place.

<Content>Not that impressed! My husband and I stayed here from March 15-19, 2005. About the only thing we liked about the hotel was the breakfast and the fact that it was very close to the railway station and we did not have to drag luggage all over Florence. However, the hotel is not in the prettiest part of town. There are abandoned buildings just right down the street. The staff was not very personable and didn't seem to really want to help. The rooms were clean, but very, very small. The shower was horrible. It was so small. I am a petite person and I had trouble moving without hitting the water knob and getting blasted with cold water. We will never stay here again and would not recommend this hotel to any of our friends.
