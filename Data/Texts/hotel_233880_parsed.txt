<Content>Staff so Friendly My wife  i stayed 3 nights, 29th dec - 1 jan, we must compliment the staff, i had never met such friendly and helpful staff in any other hotel, they go out of their way to help and always have a smile, it makes such a difference. The hotel itself is lovely, we had a large room, very comfortable  clean. We did not have breakfast, at E18 it is a bit expensive. We were a few mins walk to checkpoint charlie, some of the remaining wall, the hop on/off bus stops at checkpoint charlie  2 mins to shops on friedrichstrasse,  20 mins walk to the gate.Berlin is very spread out, we did not use public transport but there are underground stops everywhere.We went to see the xmas markets which we real nice,  which were on until new years eve, and the celebration at the gate was well worth seeing on new years eve.Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic value and friendly staff Our stay at this hotel was just a complete pleasure, in large part due to the fantastic staff. We arrive very late one Friday night but the receptionists we bright and cheery and immediately upgraded us to an appartment when they heard that it was our first trip to Berlin. They also happily looked after our bags on Sunday after we checked out and were really helpful in ordering taxi's, etc. I know one comes to expect these sorts of things but it is so nice when the service is delivered quickly, without fuss and with a smile. The appartment was spacious and comfortable without being indulgent - probably more of a business class hotel rather than a romantic botique. It is, however, seriously well located, perhaps 5 minutes quick walk from Unter Dem Linden, the Sony centre or Potsdammer Platz.Only two negative things I would note are:1) The hotel itself is stylish and easy to spot but there are a couple of massage parlours on the same road which is a little seedy (quite funny to sit and watch the men going in for a massage at 11 PM on a Saturday night though!!). 2) Breakfast is in buffet form, which I'm sure is fantastic but at 鈧?8 Euros is a little steep in a city where things are, for Europe, pretty cheap.As I'm not bothered by either of the above it's another 5 star review!

<Content>Excellent staff This hotel is very well positioned in Berlin next to Friedrichstrass. It's a few minutes walk from Checkpoint Charlie, and about five minutes walk from at one underground station, less than ten minutes from a different station on a different line.The room itself was comfortable and big.The staff in the hotel are helpful, friendly and can't do enough to help. The staff really are a credit to the hotel.We would stay here again.

<Content>Solid Business Hotel-Not 4 Star I stayed at the Mercure for business and was very pleasantly surprised by my stay. My room as unusually large by European standards. The bathroom and the shower room were separate, quite convenient when sharing the room with someone. And I was pleasantly surprise in the morning to find that the towel warmer also triggered some sort of floor warmer which kept my toes nice and toasty come the morning.With this said, I would not qualify the standards as four star. I think it's an exceptiona 3-star, but as a 4 star it's merely average at best. If you are looking for value and location, look not further, but don't expect luxury.

<Content>Well maintained, but no luxury The hotel has a convenient location, just off Friedrichstrasse which is the main shopping street in the centre of Berlin. The hotel is midsize, and combines some features of a big hotel (such as wireless internet in most rooms and a rather big and nice lounge) with some features of a small hotel (notably the bar is tiny and the breakfast room not impressive).The hotel rooms are remarkably spacious, with large windows in most rooms which makes them very light. The size of the room allows such things as placing the desk and tv set in the middle rather than in a corner, which makes working the room certainly more pleasant and less cramped. The furniture however is a bit dull and IKEA style. In fact there is not much furniture at all. But what is in the room is well-maintained and well-cleaned. Just don't expect any special luxury, and you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Amazing staff and perfect location We had a fantastic stay - we stayed at the hotel for two nights - we being my wife, our one-and-half-year son and myself - in early November... The staff - both in reception, breakfast restaurant and cleaning - were absolutely amazing at meeting our needs, borh before, during and after our stay. Before they made our room available close to our co-travellers prior to normal check.in and had a childrens bed ready and set upon arrival. During they catered for our needs in every imaginable way - room service, breakfast, our son playing all over the lobby, etc. After we had a great service when we received our forgotten stuff through post... Everything was perfect! The location is also great - close to all the different districts of the city, and close to many good restaurants and shops in the surrounding area.. The hotel itself is perfect, newly decorated and clean and nice...!

<Content>Superb hotel We went to Berlin for the Xmas markets and decided to stay at this hotel because of the very good feedback reviews on tripadvisor. For the money, it is one of the best European hotels that we have stayed in - we were surprised at how large the rooms were. It is also ideally situated and in very quiet street. The only downside was that breakfast in the hotel was not included in the price but we found a small cafe just around the corner where we could purchase rolls, sandwiches, croissants etc at a fraction of the price that the breakfast in the hotel would have cost. Thoroughly recommended - you won't be disappointed.

<Content>great hotel in a great location The hotel was in a great location, just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie. We were a party of 8 and had 4 rooms - all of them were a great size and the beds were very comfortable. Our room rate included breakfast and it was very good - they provided gluten free bread and decaffinated coffee for a few of us who had issues with gluten. My sisters birthday was on Monday and the staff heard us singing happy birthday the previous night in the bar (after midnight). The next morning we had a reserved table for breakfast with a birthday greeting and chocolates on the table. It was much appreciated.The hotel staff were very helpful, organising taxis, giving us directions to the various key sights. We walked to many of the wonderful Christmas markets - sipping gluwhein and eating barbecued sausages seems to be a national pastime and one we enjoyed.We did a guided tour of the Rheichstag, which I pre-booked at no cost before we left. (~on the parliament website) There was no queuing and we were brought around the new parliament and saw the grafitti from the Russian soldiers who held the building during part of WWII.We found the cost of eating and drinking to be very reasonable - on average about 35 euro for a three course meal with plenty of drinks - much cheaper than Ireland.The coffee shops and choclate shops were great for stopping off after all the walking - all the burned calories were soon back on!I can't advise on public transport as we walked everywhere and took an occasional taxi at night time - they were very good value at around 5 euro.Berlin was a great city and I look forward to returning and I'll be staying in the Mercure.

First of all we could reschedule our stay without any costs, although we booked the special tariff. The staff and especially the superb host were friendly, helpful and very cheerful. We could check in before noon and the room was huge and spotless! The location is great for exploring east and west Berlin. We did this by bike and we can recommend this highly!

<Content>Very good hotel in the right location We (family with three young children) stayed in the Mercure Hotel Checkpoint Charlie for one night during a weekend trip to Berlin. The hotel has a very good location (as the name suggests close to Checkpoint Charlie) in the center of Berlin. It is easy reachable by taxi from Tegel airport (20 Euro - 20 minutes on Saturday morning). We had some trouble while checking in as we had booked and paid for a family suite which was not available due to overbooking (blamed by the friendly staff on a system's issue). The receptionist asked for ten minutes patience and was able to sort it and provide us with two rooms with connecting doors instead. The rooms were both very large and clean with balconies on the courtyard side. The buffet breakfast has a wide choice of warm and cold dishes. The staff was very friendly and the overall experience and location justifies this hotel's position in the Tripadvisor Top 3 for Berlin.

<Content>Fantastic staff - perfect base to stay in Berlin! This was my first time staying in Berlin so I was fairly uncertain about which hotel to pick. After reading reviews on Trip Advisor I picked the Mercure Hotel Checkpoint Charlie as everyone had something good to say about this hotel. The staff was immediately helpful as I sent some emails with some questions which were promptly answered.When we arrived we were immediately impressed by the efficiency of the staff. They also always seem to have a smile on their face all the time which is something we really appreciated.The room we were allocated was really large, extremely clean and very comfortable. I liked the fact that the shower and the toilet facilities were separate to each other. The breakfast was absolutely fantastic and the spread on offer really great! Unfortunately I fell ill with a bad cold and temperature on the last day and the staff did everything they could to try help me out. We paid for a late check out as we had a late flight back and they let us keep the room as long as possible as they were completely booked up.We were lucky enough to meet the Manager of the hotel and have a chat with him. He obviously takes great pride in his hotel and his staff and is a certainly doing a great job...When I got back home I sent an email to the hotel thanking them for our great stay and was more than surprised when I got a phone call back from the hotel thanking us for our email. I have to say this is a first.. I was really impressed by this and would certainly reccomend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Berlin.Well done to all the staff... keep up the good work and keep smiling!! We will be back on our first trip to Berlin!

<Content>Superb hotel Following the excellent reviews of this hotel on TripAdvisor we stayed here for four nights at the end of October. We had one of the suites on the 8th floor, which cost not much more than we'd paid for a double room in a hotel in Barcelona earlier this year.The room (actually two connected rooms, one with settee and chairs, TV, small kitchen area, entrance lobby and wc; the other with the bed area and bathroom) was spotless, with a large balcony that overlooked the courtyard, and totally noise free. Staff friendly and helpful. Bar area busy but friendly and efficient.The hotel itself is superbly located for all the sites of what was largely East Berlin. Another reviewer has mentioned the French restaurant a few doors away from the hotel: very good; but Sale a Tabacci, an Italian restaurant on Kochstrasse (4 mins walk) was even better. Busy, though, so book. Also there's a taverna type Italian diagonally opposite from the hotel which is much cheaper but also good food. Next door to this is a place for breakfast if you don't fancy paying 18 euros per person every morning for the hotel breakfast. Would definetly return here.

Staff really friendly and the hotel was ideally located for sights and restaraunts, try Entrecote just a few doors down French with lovely food and great service.

<Content>Wunderful stay in a great hotel We stayed two days in this hotel for touristic reasons. We wanted to look around in Berlin, however we were here two yers ago, we stayed in the same hotel that time as well. We liked this place so much that we did not search for any other accomodation this time. We found an advantageous two days arrangement on the website which included breakfast, it was not a question whether to stay anywhere else.The rooms are spacoious, clean and has nice warm colours. The location is perfect for touristic and for business trips as well. The hotel is very nice, the staff is very kind, you will find even the finest details perfect here (free internet access, freshly made limonade in the lobby). Don't miss the breakfast, it is awesome. Have a nice stay at this hotel!

<Content>Excellent base This is a tremendous hotel for a sightseeing or a business trip to Berlin. It is also good value. We stayed for four nights.The family suite we had was spacious, modern, comfortable, quiet and spotless. There was a separate bedroom for our teenage daughter with a shared bathroom and also a separate toilet with washbasin. The hotel staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. The hotel's bar was friendly and inviting. I can't comment on breakfast - it looked pretty good to me, but 鈧?8 each seemed an unnecessary expense. The hotel's website doesn't mention that there is a small fitness room onsite, but there is.The hotel is convenient for some of the important sights and there is also an underground station very nearby. There are a few local restaurants although the area, to be fair, is not 'buzzing' (if that's what you want).We liked it.

<Content>Great stay! We had a lovely stay at the Mercure Checkpoint Charlie. We stayed for 4 nights and contacted the hotel by e-mail. Everything worked out fine, we reserved a room and the room was ready for us when we arrived in the afternoon and the requested cot was there. We had a superior room and it was huge! We had two beds which could be separated by 10 cm and a table with two chairs, two armchairs with a small table, a bathroom (shower, not bath) and a separate toilet. We had lots of space for our 3 big bags and a stroller. Everything was clean and in a good standard.We were not disturbed by any noise what so ever. Breakfast was not included and since it cost 18 euros per person, we skipped it, but we noticed that breakfast times were generous. The staff were nice, polite and helpful, checking out opening times and helped calling for concert tickets. The address in Berlin is perfect, close to the things that we wanted to see. There's a Spar (food store) close by and approximatley 3 blocks away there was a big food store, Kaiser's which closed at 10 pm. There's also Starbucks and teller machines close to Kaiser's. The underground station is close to the hotel. Stores close early on sundays, but there was a place close to the Spar, on the corner, where I could buy pizzas, warm sandwiches and salads.

The added bonus were the spacious rooms. My husband and I stayed in one room, and our single friend stayed in another room. Both rooms were the same size. They provided maps, juice in the morning, and service with a smile for no charge! Overall, our experience with the Mercure hotel has been predictable and pleasing.

We stayed on a BB basis and the breakfast could not be faulted and there was a wide variety of dishes to choose from.Our room was large,spotless, it had a King size bed and the bathroom even had a heated floor.Great after a shower! It is 5 minutes walk from Stadtmitte U bahn station-go towards Checkpoint Charlie, then take the 2nd turning on the left. Most places are possible to walk to including the Brandenburg Gate,Tiergarten,Reichstag, Unter Den Linden. Great Italian trattoria(1st right from hotel) fantastic pasta but closed Sundays.

<Content>Great hotel at a good price We stayed here for 3 nights based on the tripadvisor reviews and the excellent price we got via the hotels website-77 Euros for one night and 87 for the other two nights. The hotel is in an excellent location-walk to the wall, Checkpoint Charlie, subway, even Brandenburg Gate. The room was clean and spacious-the colour scene didn't offend me too much and it had all that we needed. We used the free wireless in the reception with no hassles. We skipped breakfast and instead went to a cafe around the corner. We did go to a restaurant a few doors down (Entrecote) which was very good. This was recommended by a member of staff who deserves a mention for being extrememly helpful and friendly. Not sure of his name but he was a giant of a man! I did have a minor problem caused by the seeming reluctance of reception staff to work with service staff but the rest of the experience more than made up for one unpleasant incident. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Very Clean, Huge Room and Convenient Location We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in July and we are very happy with the value we got from this hotel. The room is very spacious and very clean. Bed is very comfortable exactly like we had from Mercure in Paris 2 weeks before and we missed it for the whole trip. Hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. The Hotel is in a convenient location, just a short walk from subway. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as recommended by other reviewers and we found there are a lot of good places to eat near hotel. Oh! there is a small convenient store at the back of hotel so that you can get anythings like water, snack and yogurt there. We will absolutely stay here again when we come back to Berlin.

<Content>Brillliant, brilliant, brilliant. More than lived up to our expectations. We had a free upgrade to an enormous room with kitchenette, and extremely comfortable queen size bed. Location central and very quiet, and within walking distance of Gendarmenmarkt, Riechstag, Brandenburg Tor etc (but if you're more interested in shopping you'd be better off in West Berlin, eg Swissotel). In the hotel bar, the specially selected wines by the glass are excellent, and very good value. The (free) Wurlitzer in the bar has a huge selection of favourites and great fun to play whilst working through the wine list!Best of all however, the staff, all of whom are absolutely (and genuinely) delight ful and friendly and interested in helping their guests make the most of their stay. Special thanks to Lea, and no less to the lovely girls in the bar and in the breakfast room. It is easy to underestimate the importance of friendly staff until you are confronted with the polar opposite, as we were at NH Hotel in Nuremberg (see our review) where we were greeted not with sunny smiles, but sullen looks and sighs. We just appreciated this Mercure hotel all the more!

<Content>Mercure Berlin Checkpoint Charlie Very Nice We spent three nights at the Checkpoint Charlie Mercure, after spending six nights at the Mercure Hevelius in Gdansk, Poland. It is clear that the two were part of the same family. Desk staff was outstanding, with a fluent command of English and friendly and helpful demeanor. The room at Checkpoint Charlie was one of the smaller ones on the floor, but was still quite large. In fact, we often missed someone knocking on the door because it was so far away! The location on Schuetzenstrasse is wonderful for its easy access to - you guessed it - Checkpoint Charlie, but also a twenty-minute walk from Unter den Linden, Brandenburg Gate, the Staatsoper, Tier Garten, etc. In other words, it is close to a lot of Berlin attractions.My complaints are two, but minor. The breakfast buffet, though extensive, is very pricey - 18 Euros. The other complaint is that there is just one computer and printer for guests' use, and it is located in the lobby. It was not unusual for someone to spend 20+ minutes checking their email, surfing the Internet, etc. Maybe if the computer were not so visable it wouldn't be used so casually. Perhaps a sign that said please limit your online activities to 15 minutes might be an improvement.Overall the hotel is excellent, and I have no problem recommending it to anyone.

<Content>Lovely Hotel My friend  I stayed in this hotel on a room only basis in April this year. The hotel is very central  a great location. As the name suggests it is very close to check point charlie but you can walk everywhere else.The hotel is clean  rooms are large  spacious. There is a bar downstairs  staff are very curteous  efficient. An excellent hotel.

<Content>Huge rooms, flawless service After a long flight from San Francisco, a missed connection in LHR and a long, long queue to report missing bags at Tegel we finally made it here at about 12:30 a.m.! Staff were very friendly and the picture of professionalism even at that late hour; the bar stayed open a little longer so we could have a couple of drinks to soothe ourselves. The room itself was enormous. You could have played a game of indoor soccer in it. A nice little lounge area on one side, a massive bathroom where we weren't bumping into each other trying to brush our teeth.Granted there isn't much to do in the area at night, so you do need to jump in a taxi or an U-Bahn to go get a good dinner or find a cool bar. But cabs are plentiful and reasonable in Berlin, so that's never a turnoff.We stayed 3 nights and booked through the Mercure site and got a great deal of 100 euro per night.

<Content>Fabulous - no complaints My husband son and I have just come back from a 3 night stay in Berlin at the Mercure hotel and we've had a fabulous time. The hotel was very easy to get to; from the airport get the 171 bus which comes directly outside, to Rudow . Then get on the U Bahn at Rudow, change at Mehringdhamm and get off at Kochstrasse. If you purchase a ticket at the airport (ABC, which was 2.80 euro each) this will cover both the bus journey and the trains (make sure you validate the tickets too). The hotel is in a side street on the same side as the Checkpoint Charlie museum, just a bit further down.The hotel staff were very pleasant. We had booked a 2 bedroomed suite which was very clean, comfortable and very roomy. Both bedrooms had mini bars, one of which was stocked, so we bought our own drinks from a nearby Spar shop and cooled them in the empty fridge. The main bedroom overlooked the main road, which was quite quiet. The second bedroom had a small balcony which overlooked the inner courtyard. On the 7th floor there is a fitness room which has a treadmill, crosstrainer, sauna and physio thermal room - all of which are free to use. There is also a sunbed which you have to pay for. There are plenty of towels in the fitness suite for you to use and at reception you can get robes and slippers.We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there are plenty of places nearby to eat. The hotel does a very limited selection of snacks and meals later in the day but its ideal if you dont want to be bothered with going out. There are plenty of restaurants around for evening meals. We went to an Italian called Lundomare, which was lovely and was in the side road just directly across from the hotel. We also ate at a Thai restaurant called Moa Thai which was fantastic, and is definitely worth a visit. Just go left out of the hotel entrance, walk straight down to the end where all the checkpoint charlie information is on the wall, cross over the road and just follow it round and its there on the left. The decor is lovely, the waiters very attentive, and the food is to die for! We would also recommend the New Berlin 'free' walking tour to get to know your way round and to see the major sights. The hotel is very well situated for walking to all of the tourist attractions. We will certainly be going back and will definitely stay at this hotel again

<Content>Excellent hotel, good location If you plan to spend a week in Berlin, you should not miss the Mercure Hotel Checkpoint Charlie! The hotel is located in a central quite place, few minutes walk from two U-Bahn line and from the bus stop. The hotel is excellent, the staff is very friendly and professional. Our room was large, well furnished, with large bathroom and very clean. The breakfast was delicious, but a little bit expensive.We highly reccomend it!

<Content>Excellent hotel This is an excellent choice for a family of three that includes a teenager as they allow three adults in a room. Better deal than booking two rooms with a lower class hotel in the Accor chain - especially with a summer offer that included (excellent) breakfasts. They gave us a free room upgrade too. Modern clean rooms overlooking an attractive inner courtyard; safe area; helpful, multi-lingual staff. Hotel well situated - brisk walk to many of the sites of Berlin. Easy to get to from Hauptbahnhof by S and U-bahn to Stadtmitte. Eat at Lagano in Kronenstrasse for good, unpretentious Italian food.

<Content>fantastic the Mercure checkpoint charlie was amazing, we booked an executive suite and the room was huge!!!!it had a dining table for 8 people which seemed a little pointless as there was no cooking facilities but then again we didnt come to berlin to sit in our room all day. we had a mezzanine level bedroom which overlooked the lounge room and the double storey height windows which was perfect.the location was also great, only 5 minutes walking to stadtmitte underground station and around 15-20 minutes to walk to the galeries lafayette, which had some good shopping in the central part of Berlin.the staff were very pleasent and friendly and would always make us feel welcome.overall the hotel was fantastic there were no faults what so ever i'll definently be back there next time i come to Berlin

<Content>Great hotel, excellent location For a first visit to Berlin, this hotel was the perfect choice. It is in a great location - very close to Checkpoint Charlie and walking distance to many of the main tourist sites, with underground stations just yards away. It is located on a quiet street, but not too far from the hustle and bustle of historic Berlin. We had booked two deluxe suites and they were lovely. Very spacious, clean, modern with great aircon - just as well because Berlin was very hot during our stay. The hotel bar was friendly and welcoming and the staff were extremely helpful, courteous and spoke extremely good English, Overall, a delightful stay in a great hotel in a wonderful city.

<Content>Great Hotel at Great Location We booked a standard room online, and we were pleasantly surprised upon checkin after a rough day of train travel. We checked in around 10pm and were told that we had been upgraded. Our room ended up being more suite like with separate rooms for the wash closet and shower, a large seating area, a desk, and a good sized balcony over looking the well-maintained, gardened courtyard that houses their restaurant. The room and hotel were clean and well-kept. We were given a 10% discount to the Italian place down the street for a late dinner that night as well. The location is absolutely fantastic if you like to walk. It is right down the street from the Stadmitte underground stop, so as long as you don't have 2 tons of luggage, getting there via public transport is no problem. Checkpoint Charlie is literally a stone's throw away, and every other sight like the Reichstag, Museum Island, Wall Memorials, the Brandonburg Gate, etc are all within a 20 minute or so walk from the hotel. There are plenty of good places to eat in the area as well. Highly recommended!

We were in walking distance to the Brandenburg Tower and many points of interest. There is a Hop on Hop Off Bus that stops at Checkpoint Charlie, so very convenient for visiting the sights.Chose the package that includes the breakfast. The buffet has everything anyone would want and more! The terrace is great for sipping wine or having a leisurely breakfast. Staff is friendly and the beds are very very comfortable. I would go back in a flash!

<Content>We loved it My wife and I stayed at the Mercure Check Point Charlie at the end of June/beginning of July 2008. It was the first time I returned to Berlin for almost 20 years. For my wife, it was a first visit. We loved the city and are planning a return trip - if possible to stay at the same hotel. The hotel is exceptionally well located. Near the newly fashionable Gerdamenmarkt/Friedrichstrasse/Unter den Linden/Museuminsel area, with easy access to public transport. Excellent restaurants within walking distance (we were blessed by magnificent weather!). Opera and concert houses nearby. We walked over to a really good ballet at the Staatsoper on UdLinden. We had a great room - spacious, comfortable, quiet in the Residenz (an annex to the Hotel), with a small kitchen. The staff was attentive, friendly, and helpful.We had considered staying at a hotel in the Ku'damm area and are very glad we didn't. The Ku'damm looks decayed and in sore need of renovation, compared with the bright and shiny renovated areas of East Berlin.

<Content>Great comfort in the center of Berlin If it all possible, I try to stay at Mercure Checkpoint Charlie when I visit Berlin for business. The hotel offers good value for money, with modern, comfortable rooms and a central location at reasonable prices.The rooms are spacious, well-maintained and modern. The hotel is smack in the middle of town but located in a quiet street. There's a nice garden terrace for hot summer days and the staff are very helpful indeed. The breakfast is up to the usual good Mercure standard.You have two U-Bahn stations within five minutes' walking distance, and the hotel is very close to tourist hot spots like Checkpoint Charlie, Unter den Linden, Gendarmenmarkt, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag and the Museumsinsel.

<Content>Great location and friendly attitude The hotel is a bit business looking but inside both the rooms and the personel are instead quite warm. The small fitness and sauna on the last floor are tiny but very clean and welcoming. Breakfast was excellent and plentiful and would give you the right calory input to start your visit in Berlin starting from CPC j(check Point Charlie) just outside. Nothing special to say about the architecture of the block which was desighned by Aldo Rossi, quite boring yet colorful, seems a bit of a Paris periferic block.The director of the hotel is very friendly, helpful and professional.

<Content>nice hotel - bad location This is a good hotel - not great but good. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the room was clean and spacious. Everything was as you would expect for the price but to be honest the place lacks character and is a little sterile. The real downside is that there is nothing much in the neighbourhood but checkpoint charlie. If you want to enjoy a couple of drinks in a traditional German Bierhaus in the evenings or want to go to a club then don't stay here. Gartenmarkt is within walking distance and it is a lovely area but quite an expensive one

<Content>Great base for a city trip. We booked the Mercure for a four day city break based on it's excellent reviews on Tripadvisor and were not disappointed.The hotel is in an excellent location, one block from checkpoint charlie and a five minute walk from two U-Bahn stations (Kochstrasse and Stadtmitte). The price of the hotel was very reasonable, and although not a five-star luxury pad, has an excellent standard of facilities. Don't know if we just got lucky, but we were allocated a massive room (I think it was a family sized room), with seperate en-suite toilet and bathroom.The staff were extremely attentive and helpful. We did not bother paying for any meals at the hotel based on other reviews regarding the price of breakfast. This was a good choice as there is an abundance of restarants and coffee houses a short walk away.A great place to stay if you are in Berlin to explore the sights.

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great value I will simply reiterate what many of the other reviewers have said: this is a wonderful hotel, and doubly wonderful given the price and location. My wife and I were there for a week--I was at a conference--and we booked a 7 night special on Bookings.com for 99 Euros a night. Our upgraded room--part of the package, I think--was absolutely HUGE, on the seventh floor with large casement windows that opened onto the street. The room and furnishings were spotless and contemporary, as was the entire facility, the bathroom large and user friendly. Another couple we were traveling with booked the same deal and their room was just as nice, with a small balcony that opened onto the interior courtyard of the hotel. By far the biggest and nicest hotel room I have stayed in in Europe, where small and over-rated is the norm, in my experience. The hotel charges for in-room wifi but has a computer--with printer, no less, for free--in the lobby, and also has free wifi in the lobby so you can just bring your laptop or other device down there and check your mail. Location is outstanding, one block from Friedrichstrasse and close (2 blocks) to both Stadtmitte and Kochstrasse U Bahn stops. (If you're there for a week, buy the 7 day U Bahn pass for zones A and B for about 27 Euros--you'll get more than your money's worth.) Easy walk to both Potsdamer Platz and the Tiergarten. If you're a runner, a great loop is Postdamer Platz/Tiergarten/Brandenburg Gate/Unter den Linden and back down to the hotel. Hotel service was excellent with the exception of the bar staff, which was average at best. (The hotel has a very nice wine garden, and seems to do lots of events there.) We did not do the 18 Euros per day breakfast, which seemed a little pricey, so I can't comment on that; there are several good coffee and pastry/muffin places nearby--one two blocks north on Friedrichstrasse and one half a block north on Charlottenstrasse--and that's all we want for breakfast. All in all, a great hotel and wonderful stay--definitely the best I've experienced on any European trip, which includes many cities over the past 15 years.

<Content>Great Hotel in Berlin Recenty stayed here to attend a conference at the ICC in Berlin. Hotel is a nice clean 4 star hotel. Very close to Checkpoint Charlie (about 3 blocks away). We booked the cheapest room available and got upgraded to a large room on arrival. Downside was that the room was on the 8th floor and the elevator only goes to the 7th floor. Not a big deal on a daily basis except for the luggage. The rooftop room was quite nice although it had some quirks (which are to be expected in older buildings). For example, the toilet and shower were located in separate bathrooms.Staff was very nice. Service was great. For example, we left the do not disturb sign on our door while out sightseeing one day and when we can back, a bag full of clean towels was left on the door knob. Free apples are available at the front desk and Tuesdays are free massage days (register at the front desk for a free 15 minute massage).Perhaps the only downside was lack of a coffee maker in the room.

<Content>Exceeded expectations Just back from six nights at the Mercure Checkpoint Charlie, in Room 706 (same as Little Cupcakes, May 2, 2008, review).Big room, more like a suite. Hideous colour scheme, royal blue chairs and orange carpet, but that's the only criticism. Excellent bathroom, with separate toilet. Everything spotlessly clean.Helpful staff. Free internet access in the lobby. We didn't want the full buffet breakfast for 18 Euros, so they provided juice, rolls and coffee for 5 Euros.The location is excellent, about a two-minute walk from Stadtmitte subway station on Friederichstrasse, where two lines intersect.Altogether, much better than we expected.

<Content>We LOVED it! We recently stayed at this hotel upon the recommendation of trip advisor. I can't say enough about how friendly the staff was. They were nice and helpful. The rooms were extra large and very clean. We had a suite for three people-a nice surprise because we were expecting a 3rd bed to be a sofa. The only surprise was the breakfast which we thought came with the room but it was 18 euros extra. That was our fault for not asking. However, the breakfast was a good value for they had a large selection of meats, cheese, pastries, again with a very friendly staff. The location which is one reason why I selected this hotel to begin with was excellent. Only a 5 min. walk to check point Charlie and the hop on hop off bus which I highly recommend. Also close to the metro station. Overall the best hotel we have ever stayed at in Europe.

<Content>Excellent value This hotel has so many positive reviews I saw little choice but to stay here. Especially given the excellent price. But I will say it was more three star in areas than the four they showed on their door.The staff were overly friendly professional. Up there with the best I have seen in Europe. They speak very good English also.The room was more like a suite so maybe we got lucky. It had a separate living area and a huge bedroom. Off the living area was an external balcony looking down into the court yard. The funriture though, a blend of Orange carpet, yellow curtains and vivid blue suede chairs did cheapen the look with a feel more like a motel. But fittings including the bathroom with separate bath and shower were quality.Location wise this is brillant. It is walking distance to everything and only a 25 minute cab to the airport for about 鈧?5.I didn't try the breakfast because you are surrounded by cafes. A lot of chain type stuff but a decent coffee at least.On the street of the hotel is an Italian restaurant with the friendliest staff I have encountered. Good food and very good wine list. Highly recommend it.

<Content>Great Hotel, Ideal Location I stayed in this hotel for two nights and was given a very large suite with two separate rooms. One was a double, one a sitting room with sofa, chair and single bed. There was also a bathroom with a separate shower and bath with the W/C contained in a separate room (very handy).Staff were great and service was excellent. All staff spoke fluent English and were happy to help.The Hotel was located less than two minutes walk from Kockstrasse U station and from there it was easy to explore the city.Great restaurants nearby and all the city centre bars you would expect.Only downside was the cost of breakfast which was 18 euros (it was delivered to the room though and there was loads of it).All in all, this is the place to stay in Berlin as everywhere was in easy reach of the hotel and the hotel itself was a quite resting place with great service.

<Content>Big rooms, good location I paid about 72 Euro per night for 5 nights, with advance purchase/no refund rate. I was aware of breakfast and the charge, but I asked upon checkin and was not charged for it (I'm a late sleeper, and almost never eat breakfast).The room I had (706) was quite large, but a bit spare in terms of furnishings. But, there was a minibar, shower (and a separate bathtub), in-room safe and a separate water closet. The bed (two twins pushed together) was firm, and one of the nicest I encountered while on my three-week trip.My room did NOT have a 32 inch LCD or heated floors (makes no difference to me anyway). I think there are two portions of the hotel, and I perhaps was in the older portion, but the room was in good repair and not at all shabby.Plenty of windows and light, and my room faced the street. I was disturbed early AM with construction noise from across the street, but closing the windows muted it enough to back to sleep.Ubahn and Sbahn are close, and in fact you can access two different lines easily (and a third line with a 10 minute walk)which is handy to avoid changing trains. Many attractions are easily walkable, and the Kultur forum and Museum Island are also walkable in 20 minutes or so.The bar, though tiny, is nice.There is a grocery store a block or so away for you to stock the minibar yourself.The internet computer in the lobby is a great touch, and I only had to wait once or twice to use it. You can even order a beer from the bar and drink as you surf!

<Content>Really nice hotel, terrific value I stayed here for the weekend in late March as a single traveler.The hotel staff couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming.My room was pretty large, much larger than I expected. There was plenty of room for a desk that was placed in the center, a 32 inch flat-screen tv with a large number of channels in various languages. Although my room was right next to the elevator,I heard absolutely no noise from the hallway. My room contained a balcony that overlooked a courtyard. There was a large bathroom with plenty of countertop space containing a shower and a separate toilet.The hotel offers huge and quite good breakfast buffet. However, if I had one complaint it was that I wasn't told until chekout that there was a steep charge for this.There is a free computer in the lobby.The only major tourist attraction nearby is Checkpoint Charlie.However, subway and bus routes are nearby, and taxi service is relatively inexpensive.I paid about $110 a night to stay here, which, given the quality and service, was a terrific value. This would be my first choice in a hotel should I decide to return to Berlin, and I would enthusiastically recommend it to others. .

<Content>Excellent hotel Stayed for two nights at this excellent hotel. The room was spotless, comfortable and enormous (bigger than many 5 star hotels), including small kitchen area with microwave, kettle etc. Very comfortable bed, and a more than adequate bathroom (with heated floor!). The staff are friendly, courteous, helpful and a credit to the owners. This is not a full service hotel, so there is no restaurant but snacks are available at the small bar during the day and evening. However, the breakfast room is of a very high standard and a buffet breakfast at 18 euros has a wide choice of meats, pastries, cereals and fresh fruits as well as scrambled egg, bacon, sausage and more. The location is good, quietly situated, close to Checkpoint Charlie and to the U-Bahn so quick and easy access to anywhere in the city. Unter den Linden is about 15 minutes easy walk. Travel round the city is cheap with an all day group ticket for up to 5 people being especially good value. The room rate for this quality of accommodation was outstanding value at 112 Euros per night pre-paid for an Executive suite.

<Content>A Great Find! The Mecure Hotel and Residenz is a terrific hotel to stay at while traveling in Berlin. I stayed there for two nights with my parents and brother and couldn't have been happier. As there were four of us we stayed in the Deluxe Suite. The Deluxe Suite was well beyond our expectations. It had two full bedrooms, a half bath, and a shower room. This was an ideal set up.The hotel reception was very friendly and assited us with transportation and travel details. There were also always apples and iced tea availabe for the guests. The location of the hotel was excellent. It was located about a two minute walk from Checkpoint Charlie. Gendarenmarkt was only about a 5 minute walk away. We did not partake in the hotel breakfast as it was 18 euros a person. There were a dozen backerei near the hotel which we used for breakfast and I would definitely recommend this option.

<Content>Clean, cheerful, convenient Three of us females were looking for a nice but not expensive hotel close to the city centre of Berlin and struck gold at the Hotel Mercure. It's a minute's walk to Checkpoint Charlie and the rest of the city, very convenient. There's a lot of building work going on outside, but little or no noise. The receptionists were friendly and helpful, giving tips on places to go, helping with restaurant bookings etc. Nice touches in reception like bowls of apples...and jugs of cold tea (horrible, I thought it was apple juice and got a shock). Funky decor, with lots of art on teh walls for sale. The bar is tiny, more like an alcove off of the hall. There is a marquee for smokers (there was a lot less indoor smoking in Berlin than I had hoped) but the marquee had rugs and heaters and comfortable tables and chairs so was nice. The breakfast/dining room was respectable, good selection of cereals, breads, yoghurts and juices for breakfast as well as a decent cooked breakfast. The rooms were surprisingly large, or rather, long. Mine had a separate WC from the shower room, the other girls had full shower rooms. Plenty of wardrobe space, mirrors etc., small minibar and plenty of towels and toiletries (which were pleasant and not skin stripping). We all got little packets of jellies on our pillows on the first night...but not the second. Comfortable bed and squashy pillows.We downsides were that we had booked online and the hotel had taken full payment for the rooms in advance...which, as they were only 80 euro a night, were cheap at the price but we discovered on checkout that this hadn't included breakfast. That's about it though !We ate in restaruant Margaux on the first night, very fine dining...tiny portions so we filled up on the fantastic petits fours...but they were very helpful in perparing wheat free food for a gluten intolerant person in the group. The second night we found a restaurant under the railroad tracks so that we could have wurst and saurkraut...and it was delicious...and very cheap. Plenty of lucious chocolate consumed at the KaDeWe and the famous chocolate shop in Berlin that I can't remember the name of...but you'll find it !

<Content>great hotel, even better than expected I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and had a wonderfull time. The location is perfect and this was crucial since during our stay there was a strike at all public transpotation. But we still managed to get everywhere and hardly used a taxi.The hotel itself has lovely large rooms, very clean and fresh, the staff is polite and helpfull (but not very warm - I think that's the german nature).There are many caffes at the nearby main street (friedrichstrasse)like starbucks, balzac, kamp's, einstien- so you can skipp breakfast at the hotel since its rather expensive (18 euro per person). You'll find good restaurants for dinner not far from the hotel like saletabacchi.I highly recomend this hotel and hope to visit it again!

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location and Lovely Staff We Stayed in the Mercure Hotel Checkpoint Charlie at the start of March 08, having booked mainly on the recommendations of trip advisors reviews. Found this to be an excellent hotel to stay for a city break. It's location is ideal as it is close to the U-bahn, S-bahn and is within easy walking distance to the major tourist attractions.We booked a Premier Suite which had two bedrooms, a shower/bath room and a seperate WC. Both bedrooms were very spacious and clean and both had double beds, telephone and TV. There are no tea/coffee making facilites in the rooms. The hotel was very clean, rooms were spacious and the staff were incredibly friendly. Breakfast (which we paid extra for) had a very good selection of hot and cold food and it was also possible to get items made to order from the kitchen.Overall we found this hotel to be extremely good value and the staff were all very friendly and obliging, Would definetly recommend this hotel

Bathroom is very nice with heated floor and tv link (although the shower was poor).Staff were very friendly and polite.Lack of restaurant and choice of food is disappointing but there are a few places nearby.Location is good (5 minutes walk from Checkpoint Charlie) and parking is secure and reasonably priced.Business users beware - wifi was 30 Euros for 24 hours and activex and java is blocked (for remote control software) and you can't access VPNs. Real let down.

<Content>Excellent Value Booked this hotel 2 months in advance (at a cheaper rate, no cancellation policy). Brilliant value for money for a long weekend. Room was very spacious and very clean, with friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from most of the main sites and round the corner from the nearest tube (u-bahn). It is also about 5-10 minute walk from a busy shopping area. As with reviews I had previously read on trip advisor, I highly recommend staying here.Stef

<Content>Excellent Hotel I stayed here with my husband for 3 nights during Christmas and we were very pleased with this hotel. The staff are friendly are helpful and our room was spotless, spacious with a sitting area. Yes, the breakfast is expensive (16 euros) but most European hotels charge the same. We ate breakfast out - Cafe Adler across the road from Checkpoint Charlie is great value, despite the fact it looks like it is frozen in time! The hotel is in a great location. We loved the city and found the people to be very friendly. We're going back again in August with my family and have all booked into the hotel.

<Content>Great location Am only back (27/1/08-31/01/08) and had a fantastic time. Our room was a deluxe suite and it was worth paying that little bit extra.The location of this hotel was first class. to get from the airport was fairly easy  after mastering the transport system, it was great to get around  quite cheap when you buy an 78 hr pass, ensure you validate your tickets, we were checked 3 times by the undercover inspectors.On arrival in Berlin we hit the ground running and never stopped until we were on the flight home. Would I recommend this hotel, simple answer yes, as it was clean, the staff are very helpful  the location is spot on.

<Content>Stay here, you'll not regret it. Six of us stayed in the Mercure from 24-27 January (3 couples) and everyone enjoyed their stay. The hotel is situated a few minutes walk away from Checkpoint Charlie and you can catch one of the hop on hop off buses there for a tour of the city. Wrap up warm as its very cold! Eat in the Italian Restaurant across the road (2 mins walk away). We enjoyed an excellent meal with complimentary garlic bread and after dinner liquers at a reasonable price. Highly recommended!!We found the hotel very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. There are apples in reception and iced tea for guests - a nice touch. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as it was too expensive, alcohol in the hotel is also very expensive. Berlin is a very nice city, plenty to see, wear comfortable shoes for all the sightseeing and shopping. Found the Germans outside of our hotel very stern and abrupt. For example we went for drinks in Andy's Diner in Potsdamer Place. We ordered our drinks at the bar from the most unfriendliest Bar Maid I have ever come across in all my travels. There was a mix up with my order and she shouted abuse at me in front of my friends. I calmly said that there was a language barrier. She practically threw the drinks at myself and the rest of my gang with a face like thunder. We quickly drank our drinks and left. They just don't have any idea how to treat customers. A word of advice, don't drink in Andy's Diner if you prefer a courteous welcome!All in all we enjoyed our trip to Berlin and would recommend the Mercure for a nice, quiet location.

<Content>Best hotel on our 3 week Europe trip!!! This is an excellent hotel and is undoubtedly the best that we stayed in during our 3 week holiday in Europe. The staff are very friendly and helpful and gave us maps of Berlin without us asking for them. We booked a triple room, which was clean and very very big - it even had the toilet in a separate room from the shower, which is very useful when 3 people are sharing the room. The hotel also had a lunch package where they give you 2 sandwiches, 2 pieces of fruit, a drink, a yoghurt and a small chocolate for only 3.50 Euros! We also got a very nice email from the hotel after our stay asking if we got home safely and thanking us for staying there.

<Content>Excellent hotel We stayed at this hotel with 4 other friends for 3 nights. The hotel is in a great location, 10 mins walk to Unter Den Linten, 20 mins to Hackesher Markt. The nearest U-Bahn stations are Kochstrasse (5 mins walk) or Stadtmitte (7-8 mins walk).It's a very safe area for walking around at night and there are plently of restaurants nearby.The other most notable thing at this hotel is the staff. very friendly and welcoming. We were three couples and had booked three double rooms. They asked us on arrival if we would do them a big favour by two of the couples sharing a suite, because they had overbooked the double rooms. It wasnt a big problem for us, because the suite had two bedrooms and was very big. They gave us complimentray breakfast and a free drink each at the bar for the inconvenience. We would definitely stay at this hotel again in Berlin.

<Content>Brilliant for our family stay in Berlin Booked this hotel after reading the great reviews and expected to be disappointed but wasn't. My grandparents lived in West Berlin but I haven't been back since the wall came down. The hotel is just on the former Eastern side of the wall, a minute away from Checkpoint Charlie and the Ubahn. Fascinating location - a bit edgier and more stylish than the plush fleshpots of the Ku'damm. The hotel car park four floors underground (like the loos in nearby great Italian restaurant Valentino) must have been part of a former Soviet bunker complex. Rebuilding opposite of 1930s building with bullet marks. Very quiet side street: beautifully designed modern interior. Evven a small gymn and sauna ontop floor. Family suite ideal for us (2 boys 9 and 11) spanning the depth of the hotel - two very large bedrooms each with closed-in balcony, and central lobby area with loo and separate bathroom and separate shower. Nice designer touches - really comfortable low double beds, separate duvets. Hand shower attached to the bath to wash hair - and a separate shower room. Very quiet ventilator fan to the bathroom. In the main bedroom a dining table which enabled us to eat in one night with our own wine (dirt cheap from local supermarket) and room service - meal for four for 30 euros. There is a good bar service downstairs too. Communal area isn't large but very friendly and the bar is nice. Very good breakfast is extra but we didn't have to pay for the kids. We used a lot of things in this hotel - big laundry wash, car parking for four nights, room service, bar food, drinks, (free) internet access in the lobby - and were suprised at how little the extras cost. Booked through Venere and got a good deal even though late in the day. The staff are very helpful and friendly. I'm very fussy about cleanliness but was impressed at how clean the suite was. Will definitely return when I come back to Berlin

<Content>Great location, nice rooms, pleasant staff, reasonable price We recommend this hotel highly. It's on a side street, so it's not too noisy, but it's close to the sights and very close to Checkpoint Charlie (nice outdoor exhibit as well as museum). We were able to walk almost everywhere from here: museums, Berlin Philharmonic, Potsdamer Platz, Brandenburg Gate, Holocaust memorial. It's only 2 blocks away from the subway (U-bahn at Friedrichstrasse), so that also was handy. Our room was modern and comfortable, with good lighting. The staff were helpful and there was a free computer with Internet in the lobby. We paid 147 Euros a night, including tax. Tip: the hotel breakfast is expensive (16 Euros), so we went to Starbucks on Friedrichstrasse every day for breakfast, grabbing a sandwich at a snack shop on the way.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Just returned from 2 night break and have to say this hotel was superb. In great location, staff and hotel were above average. Toured all around Berlin and saw lots of other hotels but would not have picked any of them over this one. There are 2 restaurants very close the Entocote and cannot remember the name of the other one but does fantastic pizza and would reccomend them both. I would not recoomend the restaurant Maximiilions - very popular but some of the worst food I have ever had.If I came back to Berlin I would most stay here again.Not a museum person usually but the Check Point Charlie museum is well worth a vist, also from the hotel there are loads of inoformation boards just a few yards away which are fasinating.

<Content>Check Out the Mercure Checkpoint Charlie ... you won't be disappointed! I found the staff to be very friendly, extremely helpful and professional  courteous at all times.The hotel itself was a joy. Great location and beautiful, clean  comfortable rooms. You could have quite easily fit more than myself in one ... if only, anyway ... despite the small reception area, we were allowed to make full use of it as our daily / nightly meeting point and virtually ended up dossing there when we staggered back from the nights out! Waiter service from the bar and we were set for life.The hotel is in a great location and we certainly found it within walking distance of the main sights we were so desperate to see: Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag etc. etc. not forgetting Checkpoint Charlie itself.The U-Bahn was minutes away and we had no problems in getting around. We easily found our way to the main stations where we took a train for Ravensbruck  Sachsenhausen. Those not joing us on that day - spent a lovely day at Lake Wannsee.We made friends with the staff and they looked after all of our needs. They advised us on nightlife as well as restaurants; where we were keen to try the local cuisine ... the bread  dripping starter isn't quite what your Mum gave you on a Sunday tea but it's good! The Berlin equivalent of the kebab shop or post-drinking-binge eatery is also a comfort ... mmmm ... bratwurst.GO TO BERLIN AND STAY AT THIS HOTEL ... you won't regret it. Our trip was all the better and more memorable thanks to the team at the Mercure Checkpoint Charlie ... thanks guys x

<Content>Best bargain on our whole trip! We (family of 4 incl. two older teens) spent a month in Europe and I would have to say for the Euros spent and the class of accommodationsand service returned the Mercure Hotel  Residenz Berlin amCheckpoint Charlie was by far the best deal on our whole trip. At 137 Eur per night prepaid including taxes with no cancellation, no other hotel we stayed in came close, particularly in price, cleanliness and appointments.The Mercure Hotels is a mid-level price hotel chain which is part of the umbrella chain of the Accor Hotel Group which includes the Sofitel, Novotel, Mercure, Suitehotel and Ibis hotel chains as well as a number of others.The hotel itself is at the northern edge of Kreuzberg, one of the districts of Berlin (one fantastic city by the way), that has been undergoing renewal for the last 15 or so years (as many formerly East Berlin districts are doing). This one happens to include what was Checkpoint Charlie and remnants of the Berlin Wall which are only 3 blocks away from the hotel. The location is really quite good and it was quiet, day and night.The building itself if fairly new, but then so many newer German buildings are so well built (I'm an architect) and maintained, it could be 10 years old, but seem like 3. It is part of an entire city block that was redeveloped with several internal courtyards which the hotel looks into. The block itself was designed by one of Italy'smost renowned contemporary architects, Aldo Rossi. The Mercure Hotel moved into this block about 3 or 4 years ago from what I was told.In the immediate area are a few nice restaurants (a nice German/French restaurant called Entrecote is a block away) and there are quite a few cafes and local eateries and Starbucks around Checkpoint Charlie. To the north about 4 - 5 blocks is a trendy restaurant and bar neighbourhood on Charlottenstrasse which includes the Helmut Newton bar with it's titillating supergraphic and the classic Lutter and Wagner Restaurant serving good higher end German fare. Parallel and a block west of Charlottenstrasse is the classy shopping street Friedrichstrasse which has a bit of a 5th Avenue feel and includes Galeries Lafayette and a lot of designer boutiques.Transport is close with S-bahn stops (buses) and U-bahn stations (underground) at Checkpoint Charlie. There are also S-bahn stops 2 blocks to the north on Leipzigerstrasse. With these you can go virtually everywhere in Berlin making for easy access to all the popular tourist sites, cultural venues, parks and shopping districts.Our hotel room was on the 6th floor with the 7th being the top. We basically had two large full bedrooms fully carpeted connected by a wide corridor off of which there was a full tiled bathroom and a powder room and the entrance. We had two TVs and since the suite spanned the width of the building, tilt and turn windows at both ends of the suite. The suite was very comfortable, spacious and clean. All the appointments in the room were of good quality and worked well. The mattresses were ok, not sumprtuous by any means, but very adequate.We never ate any of our meals at the hotel even though the breakfast buffet looked tempting. However this is where I make my only gripe about the Mercure Checkpoint Charlie and that is the price of 16 Eurofor the breakfast buffet, which was the only choice. As we found in our research and travels in Europe, hotel breakfasts are very expensive, at least compared to what we are use to in N. America. True to German tradition, there is a well managed bar off the lobby that caters to patrons late into the night.Internet was available in the lobby on the house computer, which was at times occupied into the late evening hours.Staff were attentive, spoke very good English and were always eager to show you where you wanted to go. The hotel did not seem particularly busy in late April, but people were always coming and going. It's not a convention hotel and I don't recall seeing an exercise area.Would I go back? Yes and no. Berlin is a must see so I would certainly go back to Berlin. If value was a top priority Mercure Checkpoint Charlie is a no brainer. Knowing the lay of the land now, I might choose a different location just to get a different flavour as there are so many different neighbourhoods in Berlin, like Paris'sarrondissements. You won't be disappointed with this hotel if you get a good seasonal rate. If it was 200 Eur, there would other selections to consider including other Accor Hotels.Oh and two of many must dos. Go to Ka De We department store to the food floor, it's a gourmet's fantasy and take a Fat Tire Bike Tour (Berlin is dead flat with dedicated cycling lanes) from the base of the Fernsehturm (huge radio/observation tower), it's better than an open bus tour.

<Content>a great stay at Mercure Hotel  We stayed here for a long weekend and were very pleased, especially the large room which was very quiet. My husband was disappointed that there were no TV programmes in English however, but this was the only niggle.Incidentally we made a reservation for breakfast for the Reichstag Roofgarden Restaurant, which avoided the queues and is really worth a visit.Foodwise our best meal was at Ottenthal Restaurant, which is Austrian, the beer was also fantastic ([----]).Really enjoyed Berlin, fantastic museums -but avoid the Pergamon on Sundays. We found everywhere spotless and well organised.

<Content>Fantastic! Have just returned from a short stay at Mercure Checkpoint Charlie and, like most of the reviews I read before booking, only have good things to say about it. The location was perfect - on a quiet side street but well within walking distance of the U-Bahn and various sites including Gendamermarkt and Checkpoint Charlie. The room was excellent, very spacious - far bigger than your ususal city centre hotel and definitely more than big enough for 2 people. Breakfast was excellent with a good selection of hot  cold foods. The staff were very friendly and the complimentary city map they provided at check-in came in very handy for our stay. Berlin is a fantastic city with loads to offer and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone who is thinking of going. I hope to be back there myself one day!!

The location of this hotel is also fantastic, walking distance to all the main sights (including checkpoint charlie obviously!) and near the underground for going further afield. There were also plenty of facilities such as restaurants, cafes and shops nearby. The reception staff were friendly and helpful, and overall, this hotel was very good value.

<Content>Great hotel, good location and pleasant staff My boyfriend took me to Berlin for a surprise weekend away. Upon arrival we were told we'd been upgraded to a suite which comprised a huge bed, large living area, kitchen, walk-in wardrobe and big bathroom. Most impressed. The hotel's decor is for the business traveller in mind.The location is spot-on, right near to Checkpoint Charlie. It's also very close to the shops. We'd highly recommend the Fat Tire bike tour as the guides were informative and entertaining plus they take you for a beer and sausage! The City is flat so you won't be physically challenged and you pretty much see everthing inc Hitler's Bunker and the last remaining watchtower. We ate at Lutter  Wegner in Charlottensberg. Excellent restaurant and it serves German food - something you'll be hard pressed to find in Berlin. The nightlife is brilliant in Berlin too, stylish bars and clubs. All in all, a great city break, will definitely go back soon and stay at the Mercure!

We stayed in the junior suite and it was very big and perfect for our family. It is an easy walk to Checkpoint Charlie, the Sony Center, and great shopping on Freidrich Strasse. We would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel  Visited this hotel for 3 days at new year and had a great time. Booked the hotel on Opodo for 拢200 and the room was amazing. On 2 floors, 2 bathrooms and loads of space.The attractions are all close to the hotel and the new year party at the brandenberg gate was brilliant.Would definately stay here again without a doubt.

<Content>Mercure Hotel Checkpoint Charlie. Mercure Hotel Residenze Checkpoint Charlie - Berlin.The hotel is just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie and equally close to the underground at Stadmitte. We were looking for a nice hotel to relax in after the buzz of Christmas. It was exactly what we wanted, quiet and very relaxing, no outside noise came through to the bedrooms at all. Our room was positioned right beside the lift and I wondered if we would get much sleep, but the room was completely soundproof. Our rooms were gorgous, we had a 3 bed suite for 2 people and my daughter had a double room which while not as spacious was really snugh and cosy. Breakfast was one of the best I have had in Europe and plenty of it. Bar/cafe area was very small and quiet limited (me being Irish am used to larger bar areas). I would highly recommend this hotel if you need someplace to relax and unwind in.

<Content>Could not get better! What can we say that hasn't already been said about this hotel. Spent 4 interesting days here between Christmas and New Year and enjoyed every minute. From check in to check out every aspect was first class. Staff helpful and friendly room spacious and spotless breakfast has everything you'd ever want ok a bit expensive but we filled up for the day! Although there is no restaurant for dinner the room service snacks are well priced and service quick.Location is superb with U Bahn 5 minute walk and many attractions within easy walking distance.Can recommend the Italian restaurant on Charlottestrasse.Would have no hesitation in booking again!

<Content>Great time-Great Hotel-Great City We also stayed from Nov 25-29 at the Mercure. From the moment we checked in to check out we could find nothing wrong with the hotel or staff.The staff was always saying hello as you passed them. The front desk staff was so accomodating since we arrived at 10am and our 2 rooms were not available yet. They held our luggage and we spent the day visting Berlin. The room was beyond our expectations. It was so large The entire room was so clean. We had a small balcony overlooking the courtyard and it so quiet at night. We did not eat at the hotel.Everything you want is a quick walk away. Bakeries, resturants, exchange banking, Citibank ATM's, train and busses. We visited many Christmas Market's around Berlin and the 3 day transportation pass we purchased at the airport came in very handy. The free internet in the lobby and the fresh fruit at the front desk was a nice touch. Upon returning to Berlin in 2007 we will stay here again.

<Content>Superb Hotel We stayed in this hotel 27 - 30 November and just had to write a review upon our return.Having travelled extensively this year, staying in four-star hotels around Europe, we can honestly say that this was the best by far. The hotel is beautifully presented and situated in a quiet residential street, within walking distance of most of the major sightseeing attractions. The staff throughout the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly and our room on 7th floor was light, airy and spacious, with a large and comfortable bed. Everything was spotlessly clean throughout and the bathroom had a lovely large walk-in shower and a really powerful hairdryer.The buffet breakfast was plentiful and included a good selection of fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereals, etc., as well as a comprehensive range of hot food. All the sights mentioned in the Guidebooks are worth a visit, but if you visit the Holocaust Memorial make sure you walk right inside the maze of granite blocks, to experience the incredible atmosphere. Just observing it from the street is to miss the whole point of the Memorial. From 27 Nov - 31 Dec you should not miss the wonderful Christmas night market - the Gendarmenmarkt, which is a 10 minute stroll from the hotel.Berlin is an amazing city, made all the more memorable by the wonderful Hotel Mercure and Residenz.We would highly recommend this superb hotel to anyone planning a visit to Berlin.

<Content>Excellent hotel I've stayed in a few Mercure hotels around Europe and they can be a bit hit and miss, but I was blown away by this hotel. It is really good value for money and in the perfect location for exploring Berlin. From the minute we arrived, the staff were friendly and super-efficient. The room, which was spotless, was vast - with living room, bedroom, including 2 TVs, 2 bathrooms, 2 fridges and a mini-conference room spread over 2 floors. There is also a nice bar with an outside courtyard area. We didn't eat in the hotel, as there is so much to do in Berlin, and we were only there for a weekend, we left early and came back late most nights. But I was tempted just to stay in our hotel room, it was that nice! The only slight negative point is that it didn't have a bath - but if i go back to Berlin I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Just right! We spent our anniversary in Berlin and our hotel certainly contributed to a fantastic weekend. This hotel is great value , we got a 3 night weekend deal which included a welcome drink. Room was very big and spotlessly clean. Staff were friendly and helpful, they went out of their way to help us and everyone greeted each other as they passed. Buffet breakfast was super, location was excellent really close to the underground. Free internet in the lobby was really handy when I had to quicly check something for work. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Good Spot Stayed here for a 4night romantic break not cheap but compared to Dublin or Copenhagen not any dearer. The service was to a very high standard. Staff are friendly and curtious. The room was large and very clean. Breakfast is plentiful but expensive. The hotel offer a 'romantic stay' which incudes 2 mornings breakfast and an evening meal with wine, but it wasn't until we went to the restaurant that we realized the meal only paid for one and the wine was'nt free. Possibly we read the offer wrong but still we had a good time and enjoyed a fine breakfast in bed. The hotel is just round the corner from 'checkpoint charlie' which is a bit hyped up. Don't go on the so called 'balloon ride' nearby its a disappointment and too expensive. The location of the hotel is good once you get your bearings, only 20minutes walk to the Battenburg gate and other historical sights.Tube train nearby if needed. The taxis we found to be quite honest unlike some cities.My tip would be to go on a bike tour for a real feel of the city. Ours lasted 6hrs! But for 20euro our tour guide was a real character who read and shouted poems at various landmarks along the way!
