<Content>Great Value, great Location The hotel location is excellent (right outside exit 5 of the Hanzomon Subway line); you can take the airport limousine bus from Narita to TCAT and then take the subway right to the hotel. Or take Narita Express to Tokyo station and the hotel is a 10-15 minutes taxi ride. The hotel is fairly new and very clean. The rooms are small which is typical for Japanese business hotels but are very tastefully furnished. The hotel offers a breakfast buffet at extra charge with Japanese and Western foods. If you buy the coucher the evening before there is a 300 Yen discount. There are also a number of nice restaurants (western and Japanese) as well as coffee shops and convenience stores in the area. The only negative experience I had were the Japanese School Trip groups that the hotel accomodates. It is not nice to come down into the lobby and having to plough through 50-60 school kids to get to the exit. But other than that this hotel (like other Monterey Hotels) is great value for money. You will not find anything even close to this in large US citiies such as New York.

<Content>Recomment but with some tips For a Japanese hotel in Tokyo, this is very, very good. We have stayed there many times (as business and tourist users).It is small but by Japanese standards, it is pretty spacious, which I think many people can only appreciate if they have tried typical Japanese hotels (which are dire!). For more space than this you would need to try the more established hotels like New Otani. Others have cited the good things about the hotel so I thought I would mention a few things to be aware of.Smells: Its possible to get non-smoking rooms which don't have the old smell of smoke (a lot of hotels still retain that old cigarette smell from the days when smoking in all rooms would have been allowed)Pillows: It's possible to get a soft pillow (as for this when you reserve and remind them at the desk upon arrival). Otherwise you will end up with the typical pillow which is like a sack of rice - very, very uncomfortable.LCD light from alarm: this is awfully bright and might bother more light-sensitive sleepers. If this might be a problem for you, you might want to take precautions. We use the hotel notepaper or use business cards to cover the alarm and we always carry sellotape!Aircon/heater: in the winter, the room can get very hot and dry and there is no way of making it more comfortable. we have slept badly because of the dryness of the air (its impossible to switch the aircon in winter). In the summer, the aircon is quite good but you might need to fiddle with the temperature in the middle of the night otherwise you might catch a chill.Breakfast:The hotel only serves Japanese breakfast which we find difficult to eat first thing in the morning. Unfortunately, the Sunflower Cafe has closed down - it was the only place that offered decent croissants, bagels or toasts with your coffee or tea. There is a Tully's Coffee shop which is smokey and packed in the mornings or a local place where you can get a coffee but not eat and a UCC for coffee (again smokey and a bit dingy). We buy a croissant from a pattiserie close by and eat it as we walk to a coffee shop (though eating in public is not really done in Japan).Weekends: Hanzoman is dead on weekends and national holidays and after 7pm. You need to venture out a bit to get to the more lively parts of Tokyo. Being close to the station makes it very easy to get around or hailing a taxi is quite easy as there are many around.

<Content>comfortable, modern and affordable We stayed at this middle-sized hotel for 3 nights and were very happy with our choice. The hotel is new, modern and clean. Service is friendly. The room (not large but it's Japan) was very comfortable and the bathroom really nice with its fancy color scheme. Both were extremely clean. We got a really good deal booking through voyages-sncf - no breakfast included but the neighborhood provides a few options (we recommend Caf茅 Veloce just around the corner - turn right and then right again when exiting the hotel), much more affordable than the buffet breakfast at the hotel. There are a lot of convenience stores, and several affordable restaurants around the hotel. From Narita airport, we took the Limousine bus heading for TCAT, and from there the subway (Hanzomon line) which brought us directly to the hotel.

<Content>Handy for the Subway in quiet area Ideally located across the road (literally!) from Hanzomon subway station on the Hanzomon line. The hotel is 2 blocks from the Imperial Palace but the area around the hotel is residential with only a few shops, restaurants etc. It's not a busy area so is ideal for escaping the rush of downtown Tokyo.The room was small by western standards but above average for Japan. If you're anything over 5.5ft the bath will be a bit of a squeeze and the bathroom was compact. Very little in the way of views from the hotel. Didn't eat in the hotel but there is Chinese Restaurant on site. There are vending machines on each floor selling beer, soft drinks and water and in the hotel lobby, there are two PCs with internet access (coin operated) - 100 yen for 10 minutes.There's a 7-11 2 minutes walk from the Hotel and a Starbucks about 10 minutes from the Hotel.Good value for money for Tokyo and handy for the subway.

<Content>Stylish and refined - and good value! As a solo traveler on a long trip through Asia, I wanted a place in Tokyo that would serve as a convenient home base for exploring the sights. The Monterey Hanzomon is situated in the middle of the city. It is only on one subway line, so it is a little harder to get to, but if you're used to navigating any kind of public transportation system (like NYC) you'll have absolutely no trouble in Tokyo. The hotel is sleek and stylish, yet welcoming (think W Hotels.) The hallways are decorated in modern, dark tones and feature calming music that instantly whisks you away from the frenetic pace of the city. While the basic rooms are quite small, I don't imagine the average room in Tokyo is much different. The decor inside the rooms is also quite nice, and the most important things are done well: shower pressure is amazing, the toilet has lots of strange buttons (gotta love Japan for that), and there are more free toiletries than you'll know what to do with. There's even BBC on the tele and free Wall Street Journal Asia under your door. It's not a five-star hotel, but they offer some great rates that make this a real bargain for an expensive city like Tokyo. Definitely would return.

<Content>stylish We got a great rate as we booked this hotel only before we got on the plane. Hotels in Japan are very different to hotels in Europe. The rooms are small and 3 or 4 star hotels are very expensive. The Monterey Hanzomon is a modern and stylish hotel with great interior and design. The rooms are still small but very clean.

<Content>Convenient base and reasonably priced My husband and I stayed at the Monterey Hanzomon for 3 nights in June 2008. We paid 拢66 a night through lastminute.com which was a real bargain. Our room was reasonable sized, clean, and quiet. The decor was modern with a few nice touches - the flower prints above the headboards and the striped wallpaper of different shades of chocolate and purples in the bathroom showed some effort had gone in to making the room relaxing and homey.The hotel is located literally across the street from the Hanzomon metro station, which makes it a very convenient base for sightseeing or heading out in the evening. It took us about 20 minutes to get to Shinjuku and slightly longer to get to Roppongi - but living in London we are used to a bit of a journey on public transport to get anywhere! And to be honest, in a city the size of Tokyo, you are going to have to get used to travelling to get anywhere!There is not much in the way of nightlife around the hotel, although there are a string of restaurants on the same road as the hotel. We ate at one on our last night there - a kind of fusion bistro - which was actually a really nice change from the bright lights of Shinjuku and Roppongi. It had a lovely neighbourhood feel. There is also a great bakery a few doors up from the hotel which is good for picking up a cheap breakfast on the run.If I found myself in Tokyo again I would certainly stay at the Monterey Hanzomon again. Some recent reviews have criticised the cleanliness of the hotel, but our room was spotlessly clean and so were the public areas. A few reviews have criticised the reception staff - all I can say is that the staff I spoke to were helpful and friendly, even if their english was limited.If you want to be right in the thick of the neon and nightlife this is probably not the right hotel for you. But if you want a decent hotel as a convenient base that won't break the bank, give the Monterey Hanzomon a try.

<Content>Worst Hotel experience We've stayed in a range of high end luxury hotels and super cheap hotels and while this isn't the worst place we've stayed at, it definitely was a bad experience. Tokyo is a great city but it's an easy city to feel lost in considering the limited spoken English and Japanese characters and the last thing you need is a hotel that's unwilling to help. We found the service here to be one of the worst ever. Very few of them spoke English and the instructions they did give were completely thoughtless. For example, we asked them how to catch the airport limousine on departure. They told us where to go but failed to tell us that we had to reserve a seat. Of course, when we got there, the bus seats were sold out and only after someone haggled with the bus driver did we somehow get on. We were especially perturbed by the fact that they called us to demand that we check out immediately and they would be charging us for being late. Of course we realized later that the notice of a 11am checkout was on our desk. However, it was in Japanese. Oh, and we're married and they still put us in a room with 2 single beds. On a side note, the rooms are on average okay. Not worth the $180/nt we paid for the room. We've stayed in better rooms for that price. While this hotel might be nice for locals, this definitely is not a place to stay at if you're not.

<Content>nice little hotel, but not much in the neighborhood easy to find from the hanzomon subway station. front desk staff was friendly and helpful but english was limited. they also were not able to exchange any money for us. room was very clean and comfortable. no coin laundry which was an inconvenience since we also could not find one in the surrounding area. neighborhood is quiet but there's not too much in terms of things to do. there are convenience stores and small restaurants within walking distance. probably would not stay again because of the area it's in. too out of the way from major sites.

<Content>Trendy on the Outside, Filthy on the Inside We stayed at the Hanzomon hotel toward the end of a two week+ trip visiting several cities in Japan. The general exterior of the hotel is very nice, as well as the lobby, elevators and room floors. The staff is friendly enough (not overly friendly by any means though, which was usually the case in our other hotels--a good thing) and the hotel is also conveniently located right across the street (literally, take exit 5) from Hanzomon station, and that was great.I did have a problem, however, with the cleanliness of our room, because it was pretty filthy. The walls, carpet and dust ruffles on our beds were all stained pretty blatantly. This grossed me out. Even the bathroom doorknob was all greasy. We even stayed in a capsule hotel prior to staying here, and while that was a bit older and dingy, it was still much cleaner than our room at the Hanzomon. I just couldn't understand why they wouldn't replace the carpet or repaint the walls after a certain point.I honestly wouldn't stay here again. The experience may be OK for others though--considering I read reviews here prior to booking this hotel and not one of them mentioned having a filthy room. So maybe we just had the misfortune of getting the dirtiest room in the hotel.

<Content>Great place to stay for the money! Very clean and modern! Great hotel but the rooms are very small! Standard I hear for Japan. The beds are a little hard as well, other than that they offer a lot of good amenities such as a cocktail vending machines and loads of bathroom supplies. haha! The hotel is right across the street from the subway station so that made it very east to get around. The hotel is also in a business/residents part of town so it is a little less busy than other areas in Tokyo. The only complaint would be that the staff cant speak that great of english (I know I was in another country) but it was a little hard to understand each other. I would stay here agian it was a great place very modern/clean and is great for the money that you pay.

<Content>Carpet call I stayed in a single room and was quite surprised that the room was larger than I expected. The room decor could do with some modernisation. The carpets looked quite badly stained. Appart from this, the bedding was very clean and the bathroom was well presented and quite clean - if not for the old decor and stained carpet, this hotel would have received a better rating. The room I had was non smoking, but unfortunately there was a stale odour of cigarette somke in the room - I am sure people have smoked in the room. The location of the hotel was quite good. It is accross the road from exit 5 of Hanzomon metro station - has to be the easiest hotel in Toktyo to find. Buy yourself an all day metro ticket for Yen 1000 ( which will let you travel on all metro lines) except JR and you can see a lot of Tokyo. If you want to eat near the hotel there are a few restaurants to your left. If you are not into Japanese food, then walk about 1 km to your left as you exit the hotel or if you are in Hanzomon station itself go out exit 2, Macdonalds and Starbucks plus other cafes and restaraunts are near by. I would probably stay at the Monterery again, but an upgrade of the decor and a good clean of the carpets would take this hotel from OK to excellent.

<Content>Great Location, Great Price, Great Hotel My family of 4 had 2 adjacent rooms and stayed for 7 days. We liked Hotel Monterey Hanzomon very much and would not hesitate going back in the future. We picked this hotel for the price and the great location close to the subway, since we were in Tokyo to go site seeing. The rooms were small by US standards, but comfortable for 2 people. Modern, simplistic styling and very clean. Each of our rooms had 2 single beds, each bed being about 4-6 inches wider than a US twin bed. The pillows were Japanese style that had beads in them that kind molded to your head. The bed was firm and the duvet/comforter was cozy. The bathroom is compact and the tub is deep. The shower head has multiple settings and can be handheld. The toilet has a seat warmer and bidet. There are plenty of toiletries. The room has a minibar/fridge which we put some of our own drinks we had bought at the convenience store (AM/PM) almost right next door. There are vending machines on each floor, with vending machines with alcoholic beverages being on the odd numbered floors. Being from the US, it was strange seeing beer and cocktails in vending machines, but I saw this many places in Tokyo.The Free Internet access was excellent!! They have an Ethernet port on the night table between the beds. They also provide a cable in each room. I VPN鈥檈d into my work in Houston quite a few times, and the speed was better than working from my home 飦?I had also brought my Vonage adapter and was able to make phone calls to the US for free.There is an electric hot water 鈥渒ettle鈥?and they provide instant coffee and tea bags. They also provided robes and slippers. There is also a Flat panel TV, but not many channels in English, and a hair dryer. The electrical outlets are 2 blade polarized, so US devices (without a ground) could plug directly into to them. You will need an adapter if your US devices have a ground. The key to the room controls the light/air conditioning. Also you are asked to leave the key at the front desk each time you leave the hotel, which at first we thought was going to be a hassle, but it really wasn鈥檛. There was always someone available to hand the key to or retrieve it for you when you got back to the hotel. We had a bit of trouble figuring out the air conditioning, but instead of asking the front desk, we just cracked the window a bit when we got a little warm.There was a breakfast buffet for about 1900 yen. It had a variety of foods (Chinese/Japanese/Western), but for the price it was just OK to me, plus we don鈥檛 eat much breakfast. There is also a Chinese restaurant in the Hotel that we did not try.The staff at the front desk were nice and very polite and so were the cleaning staff. The hotel was very quiet and we had no problems with noise. The Hanzomon subway Station 5 has 5 exits. Exit 5 is directly across the street from the Hotel. There is an elevator at this exit that goes from ground to station level and elevator/escalator that goes from station to train level, so you don鈥檛 have to lug your luggage up and down stairs. Also there is a McDonald鈥檚 at the opposite end of the station, right at Exit #1. There were many times we would cut through the Hanzomon station to grab something to eat at McDonalds. There are a few other restaurant in the area, but it鈥檚 a pretty quiet area in the evenings. We felt safe walking around at night.

<Content>modern decor, nice rooms, decent location We booked a decent rate through Agoda, but it was non-refundable, which was my biggest complaint. The hotel itself was really nice; modern decor, very clean, nice rooms, decently sized, etc. The location is practically right on top of the Hanzomon subway stop. It's good that it's convenient to go elsewhere, because there's not too much in the immediate area. Service was excellent.

<Content>We Loved Hanzomon My sister and I stayed at this hotel鈥?.and we loved it! It鈥檚 like a 5 star hotel! It鈥檚 a trendy boutique hotel. The rooms are super cute鈥ell decorated and always super clean. The beds are comfy, the bathrobes are styling, and the bathrooms are fabulous! The rooms were perfect in size (not too small鈥?we had 2 twin beds). The hotel is located steps away from the Hanzomon subway line....very easy to get to anywhere in Toyko. The hotel is located in a very nice high-end condo residential area. The area is really safe (even in the middle of the night). We loved this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone! And I would definitely stay there again! It鈥檚 a nice place to call home after a long day! Aman-Toronto, Canada

<Content>Fabulous Location This was our very first hotel that we booked in Japan and we weren't disappointed! The hotel was small but that was really of no surprise to us as that seems to be the trend in Japan. Everything was tastefully decorated and overall kept quite clean. The location just couldn't be beat. We were able to walk to the Imperial Gardens and the main shopping district and there were tons of great little restaurants and cafe's in the area. The hotel itself was a little difficult to get to on the subway system from the airport but that was mainly because we didn't know which line to transfer to when we arrived in Tokyo station. You can either try to figure it out or just take a taxi. It should only be about $15. If you're looking for a great central hotel to all the main things in Tokyo, I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Great Place - Returning Again! After reading positive reviews at multiple sites, I tried the Hotel Monterey Hanzomon my last trip and loved my stay! Quiet area, close to the Imperial Palace (with gorgeous 5k paved path around the grounds). Staying again soon (business + running the Tokyo Marathon), since this is my favorite small hotel. For one person, the single rooms and bathrooms are just fine - and the non-smoking ones (my only experience) are clean, fresh, and quiet. Everything is new, staff is friendly, and you can get along fine with English only. Hotel kept my bags for two days when I checked out for a side trip to Osaka, so that was an extra that was helpful. Breakfast is traditional buffet (Japanese + Western items) with plenty of juices, coffee, tea, and milk. Several small coffee shops and cafes nearby, but the GREATEST convenience is the location - directly across the street from Exit #5 of the Hanzomon stop on the Hanzomon subway line. Even my Japanese clients agree this hotel is a gem for the price! Highly recommended for tourist or business travelers. Practical hint (my Japanese staff helped me with this part): from Narita airport, take the Hotel Limousine bus to the Hotel New Otani, then hop a taxi (720 yen) to the Hotel Monterey Hanzomon (just take a printed map for the taxi driver, showing either the hotel location or Exit #5 of the Hanzomon station).

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the hotel for 5 days in Dec and we loved it. The hotel is new with a very modern deco. The hotel stuffs speak good english and there are complimentary bath salts at the check in counters. Althought the room is quite small (3 single beds) but we are happy with it as it's the same for most mid-price hotels in Japan. The bathroom was stocked with all the necessities, even hairclips which are a surprise for us. The only downside is the TV programs available. The only English channel they have is BBC and the other japanese channels are very boring. Although it is located just across the Hanzomon station, travelling to town area like Shinjuku, Ginza etc is a hassel as we need to change a few lines before getting to our destination. But this is not a very major problem. Overall we are satisfied with the hotel and we don't mind coming back if we visit Tokyo again!
