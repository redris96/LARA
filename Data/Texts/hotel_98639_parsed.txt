<Content>Decent for the price We stayed here for one night after reviewing quite a few hotels in this area of Dallas. Our experience was quite positive. Helpful friendly staff at the reception desk. Our room was large, with a very comfortable bed and very clean. It is clear that rennovation money was spent on the rooms (rather than halls and elevator) but since the room is where we spent the most time - this worked for us. AAA rate was quite reasonable.

<Content>Okay service, dirty rooms, internet hackers in the business cetner I stayed at this hotel with some colleagues for a business trip. I booked three single rooms with king sized beds, when I got to my room, there were two beds. But when I went downstairs to complain, the man at the front desk said since I booked through Expedia, they don't guarantee rooms.The room was okay, I was somewhat annoyed because there was what looked to be a food stain on the duster of the bed. A little gross.The breakfast was okay, the table dirty and the service was slow.When I checked out, I asked for a receipt, they couldn't give me one saying that since I booked through Expedia, they don't know how much I paid. This would have been fine but the woman at the front desk was outright RUDE.Lastly, when I got home, I noticed some weird things going on with my credit card. Turns out someone hacked my account and added themselves as an authorized user. The only way I can think this happened is someone either was watching or hacked my account when I was in the business center. There were some shady characters there, and I know not to look up financial information at hotels.Overall, no major issues but enough minor ones to make the stay unpleasant.

<Content>Hotel Staff Let In A Burglar to My Room! Warning - this hotel has HORRIBLE security practices.I stayed at this property 9/11-9/14 and, as a Starwood Platinum guest, was given a nice room on the club floor. However, I came back from work to find my Ipod, Bose Headset, and two sets of keys missing!After digging around, it turns out the housekeeping staff admitted to letting a stranger with no ID into my room. There didn't even bother telling me until I reported the crime to the police.After 8 calls to Starwood -and many promises up and down the chain - a week has gone by and I am still waiting on them to provide me a form to submit a claim. Not only was the hotel negligent - they are totally inconsiderate. How hard is it to send out an insurance form???NEVER STAY HERE. EVER.

<Content>Nice Hotel We booked a room with Prava Suites through Hotwire and were moved to this hotel. This is a nice hotel, with a new remodel. Rooms are comfy and updated with flat screens and Starbucks coffee too. The only problem we had was not getting our room cleaned the second night. The lady asked if we wanted our room cleaned, and we said yes, and we would be leaving soon, only to come back late that night to a dirty room. Hotel staff was not too concerned either. Who knows maybe the lady didn't understand English??Happy Travels!!

<Content>Needs some work This hotel has the potential to be a very nice hotel but seems to have stopped trying. The hot tub was out, the pool area is very stark and would benefit from some plants, the women's restroom at the pool area was out of order, ice machine on our floor was broke...Room was nice enough except for the ancient pepperoni we found on the floor by the drapes. None of these things would matter alone, but all together show a lack of attention to detail and customer care.The worst was the driver who took us to the Galleria Mall in the hotel shuttle. He crammed more people in the van than there was seat belts for. He did not wear a seatbelt. He had the radio set to an offensive rap station full of explicit sexual language. And when I asked him how he was he replied in an annoyed tone Bored.The best was the rest of the hotel staff who were very friendly and helpful.Would I stay here again? Not for the money.

<Content>Club floor GREAT! We stayed at this hotel for a conference, and were on the Club floor. Beautiful, spacious rooms with great views. Recently renovated, and it looks it. I did see the hallway on a lower floor, and it wasn't as regal. Our floor and room were great, as was the suite used for our meetings. (The bartender was very unfriendly, be warned.)

<Content>Average business-class. Booked room through SPG, used points. Stayed here due to proximity to events in Dallas area, lesser points category. Hotel indeed renovated. Rooms appear new, with flat screen tv. Good.Renovation of common areas (hallways/elevators) not yet complete, I hope. Ambivalent.Speant little time. This hotel will be fine. Just woudn't recommend to a travelista or someone looking for Ritz-type experience (duh- It's a Sheraton!).

<Content>Very nice and comfortable hotel. It is obvious that this hotel has just had some upgrading done. The lobby is very nice and clean. The rooms have new furniture, still smells new. The beds are very comfortable. The guest services staff were all WONDERFUL and very helpful. I loved the shuttle amenity...it'll take you just about anywhere in Addison and pick you up when you are ready, they're pretty quick too. This was my favorite feature about the Sheraton!

<Content>Better than I expected I arrived at the hotel and was a little disappointed from the outside. The exterior looked old and unloved and the parking lot was a little scary. However, upon entering the room I was pleasantly surprised. I stayed on the 14th floor (labeled a Starwood Preferred Guest floor, which I am) and the room appeared to have been recently remodeled. Flat screen TV (although with only a couple dozen channels), Starbucks coffee, Bliss soaps and shampoo with a yummy mandarin mint scent, comfortable bed with fluffy white comforter. Very much on par with what I have seen from the newer Sheraton hotels. Good deal for the money ($162 with taxes on a weekday).

<Content>Not what I expected Booked two rooms for three nights. Could not get one room with two double beds for any of the nights or even a roll away bed. I booked this through Priceline so that was probably one of the problems. The hotel could not accomodate us on anything. Do not know if this was due to us being priceline customers or the fact that they had a hotel full of youth soccer players who had free reign of the hotel. The continual running up and down the halls yelling and screaming did not add to the atmosphere. Rooms were fairly decent but seemed hollow. The doors were paper thin and being close to the elevator was a pain due to the constant flow of people all night. Having to listen to their loud conversations while trying to sleep was not pleasant. Only two of three elevators worked and the two that worked were extremely slow. My son called for a channel guide because there was not one in the room, the lobby sent one up. The next night my daughter in another room called for a channel guide and they made her go down and get it. I guess this place is hit or miss on the service and we definitely had a stay that was far from pleasant. We are not fussy people as were are a family with four kids and know traveling is never going to be perfect but this was not what we were expecting from a hotel of this supposed caliber. I am glad I did not pay the going advertised rates because I would have really been upset. Happy travels.

<Content>brand new sheraton (sort of) stayed at the sheraton north dallas, which opened on jan 25th, last week. It was actually the wyndom galleria, but now it has new management. I actually booked the hotel thinking it was the wyndom, so it was a surprise when i drove up to a sheraton. With new owners, there are new furnishings, new carpet, etc... it feels like a new hotel. There is construction going on to redo the rooms. The worst noise though was the aircondition/heater turning on at night. Very very noisy. Also the highway could be heard (i 635 is right outside). The location was great...the galleria is a minute away (not close enough to walk, though). The staff was very friendly and kind. The internet connection was free, wireless, and very slow. no fridge or microwave. everything was clean.

<Content>great entrance, but went downhill The hotel had a beautiful lobby and pool area. The kids loved the inside/outside pool. From there, however, it was not as great. The room drastically needed remodeling. There was some construction going on, so maybe they were in the process. The bathroom was unusually small, although had nice amneties for your personal use (shampoo, soaps.) The staff was very friendly and helpful. I wouldn't have wanted to stay longer than a day or so, just due to the room and bathroom. Overall, however it was fine.

<Content>Good location, nice hotel I stayed at the Wyndham by the Galleria on a business trip in October 2007. The hotel itself is pretty nice (it used to be a Hilton, apparently) and the location is an easy walk to the Galleria and is a quick cab ride from Love airport.The pros: -big, clean rooms with Bath  Body Works bath products. -an easily accessible business center where it was no problem for me to print out my Southwest boarding pass (at no charge)-Very friendly, very helpful staff-A good hotel, though it does permit smoking so be warned if that bothers you-Nice and close to the wonderful GalleriaCons: -No free wireless. I still don't get why ALL hotels don't offer this for free.-I had a busted wake-up call button on my phone (it rang busy.)Those are pretty minor complaints, though. The hotel was great for business travel, and a very comfortable place to stay overall.

<Content>Great stay This stay was great from start to finish. The gracious staff and amenities made up for the parts of the hotel which had not yet been renovated.Although I arrived early my room was ready and they allowed me to check in. They apologized that my snack and beverage were not yet in the room and that they had not yet put my hospitality basket [for the event I was attending] in the room. They offered to have a staff person carry the hospitality basket to the room for me. When I returned from lunch and a little bit of sightseeing they had placed a bottle of wine, a box of crackers, cheese, a bottle of water, a pretty glass plate, a cloth napkin, silverware and a wine glass in my room. The wine, cheese and crackers were all high quality products. There was enough that I and my roommate used them for a light lunch the next day.Saturday morning we ate in the restaurant. About the time that the waitress should have been serving our breakfast she appeared very apologeticlly. The cook had just told her that they were out of smoked salmon [an ingredient in my omlet] and would I like to substitute something else or order another dish. I ordered another dish and it was out very quickly. Not only was my breakfast comped but also my roommate's breakfast was comped.Saturday night when we arrived back from the dinner and party there was a voicemail message. The manager had called to find out if I needed any help the next day when I was leaving. She also wanted to know how my stay had been and if there had been any problems.Sunday at noon [check-out time] the hotel system shut off the key cards for all the rooms. They called the event host without prompting and apologized. They offered to make new key cards for anyone who needed them until they left.

<Content>Good place to stay. Excellent service. My family of 4 stayed in a junior suite for the second time in 2 months. The condition of our rooms was excellent both visits. The hotel staff were very good in general. The service from the desk people and room service were excellent for a hotel of this price range during both our visits. Our requests for room service were delivered within 10 minutes every time. The (2nd visit) desk person lowered the price of our room when when we checked in because my wife had mentioned (when she booked it online) we had stayed there a few weeks earlier for a much lower price. The bad stuff: the main restaurant had slow (but friendly) service. Standard hotel fare. The restaurant and pool areas both need a rehab. We did not need to be located near a major consumer mall. The overall location was convienient for us, though.Other than Internet access (standard free direct cable connect and WiFi) I did not use the business facilities of the hotel but they appeared to be first class.

<Content>Best price to be close to Galleria My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend for the two of us. We primarily chose it b/c it was the best price for a hotel room near the galleria. Most of the hotel is pretty nice but I was a little disappointed in the room just b/c the decor seemed very outdated. Other than that theroom was fine from everything working right, comfort of beds, noise, view, etc....Given that you pretty much need a car to get around Dallas (unless you want to spend a lot of money on taxis), proximity to Galleria really wasn't all that important after all. We found ourselves driving so much to get anywhere that we could have stayed somewhere else and made the Galleria just another place to stop by. There is a restaurant within a short drive of the hotel named Three Forks. I had one of the best meals ever in my life there and would encourage you to stop there at least one night.

By merely doing this...Drinks, Snacks, Extras were all pleasantly staged in my room prior to my arrival. Clean rooms... Friendly staff and OK bed makes this hotel a good choice. My only reccomendation would be for this hotel to upgrade the beds like the Westins. Regarless, all in all a solid hotel.

<Content>Selected This Hotel Three Times We visit our daughters in Dallas every Christmas because they do not have enough room and allows us to not choose between them. Each time we stay multiple nights. I love the way they decorate at Christmas. THIS HOTEL IS A GREAT LOCATION. We can easily drive to our dining favorites and there is wonderful shopping areas nearby.Booking a room on their site is easy and we have found the rates are pretty good.BECOME a member of their BY REQUEST club and you will walk in to find refreshments of your choice.We've had no problems so I cannot write about the management.Next Christmas we'll be there again unless their rates become too high.

I got a welcoming call, and then another call later in my stay to make sure I had everything I needed. I ordered room service two nights. The food was hot, plentiful, and very good. Because I signed up for Wyndham by Request (free!) I had a great welcoming treat of wine, cheese, and crackers. I highly recommend using this benefit.The bed was comfortable and the linens and pillows just right. The Galleria is walking distance, although there is a free shuttle from the hotel. Overall, I highly enjoyed my stay and would definitely come again!

The Wyndham was far better and $40 a night less. The hotel is busier during the week than on weekends.The drinks in the bar are strong at a decent price. The bartender was great. She was was very friendly. On the second night she remembered the previous night's orders. The food in the restaurant was excellent. I don't think my glass ever reached the half-way mark.Internet access is $10.95 a night. Plenty of free parking.

Room service was great, the room was very clean and the front desk, concierge and shuttle drivers were cheerful and helpful. There is a regularly scheduled shuttle to the Galleria which was very convenient.

<Content>Gave our room away after 2 nights I pre-paid for 4 nights at this hotel. I stayed in the room for two nights. The third night at midnight I returned to the hotel and put my key in the door but it wouldn't work. I went to the front desk to find out what was wrong: they had checked me out of my room and put other people in my room. They didn't even apologize for this debackle and they told me to come back the next day to work out the financial issues. The room was okay, definitely not updated, pretty old furnishings. The bathtub wouldn't drain (and they didn't fixit after I asked), toilet kept running, etc.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Room Service I stayed at the Wyndham for a business trip, then returned for a weekend getaway. The hotel is in a great location right off the highway, and is only a few blocks from one of the biggest malls, the Galleria. Restaraunts can be a little hard to come by, but I would suggest the room service. The staff is very friendly and the food is great. Our room was clean (which I am very picky about) and we had no issues with the hotel. The only thing was that parking gets full at night, but the hotel was booked when we were there. One key: if you want to stay in a Wyndham, join their free club, Wyndham By Request. Before you arrive, you can request the type of pillows you want, the type of room, where you want the room (by elevator or on low floor) and they even provide snacks (cookies, candy, bottled water, sodas) all for FREE. Most hotels, when you make a reservation, the room is not guaranteed. With Wyndham By Request, they give you priority.

<Content>Wyndham consistently dependable I have yet to be disappointed with a stay at a Wyndham, and my recent stay at the Wyndham Dallas North by the Galleria is no exception. I experienced a smooth and pleasant check-in, clean and spacious room, convenient and reasonably priced restaurant (I highly recommend the breakfast buffet!), and easy express check-out. The only thing I noticed that was missing (although not really a problem for me) was that there was no bellman at the door when I arrived.The Galleria shopping center is a 5 minute drive (the hotel offers a shuttle). The location next to LBJ Freeway (I-635) was a concern at first, but I found it to be easy to get around, and I didn't hear ANY traffic in my room that faced the freeway. One big tip: If you choose to make a reservation here, be sure to sign up for the Wyndham ByRequest program beforehand. You can do it online, it's free, and I haven't found any catches so far. The membership gives you. among other things, free highspeed internet access and free local AND long-distance phone calls (yes, free long-distance). And they give you a welcome snack, which you get to choose! It takes effect immediately (you don't have to earn any number of points before the benefits start)...It's unlike any other frequent-stay hotel I know of.I highly recommend the Wyndham Dallas North by the Galleria.

<Content>Worst Hotel Experience Ever I stayed here for one night on January 25th, 2006 and it was quite simply the worst hotel experience that I have ever had. I travel for business domestically nearly 100 days a year and need to come to Dallas the night before for meetings the next morning. I searched the hotels.com for a hotel of at least 3-stars which could guarantee me a non-smoking room and was able to reserve this Wyndham by the Galleria. When I arrived at 9 pm, they simply booked me into a room on the third floor and when I got the floor it reeked of stale cigarettes. When I opened the room door I was just about bowled over. It smelled like lung cancer. You would shake the bed cover and pillow and small ashes could be seen flying off into the air. I went back downstairs and asked at the front desk that they switch me to a non-smoking room and they said that they had none. I said how is that possible as I reserved and PREPAID for a non-smoking room? and they smirked (seriously) and said read the fine print - we give you the best room that is available considering your request - and there are no non-smoking rooms available. I went back to the room quite upset and thought well then maybe I can just open the window for fresh air. THE WINDOWS DO NOT OPEN! How crazy is that - hundreds of smokers in this room and no ventilation - not even a fan to the outside? I tried to turn on the AC/Heater for fresh air and all it did was stir up the ashes in the room. Bottom line, if you smoke and like hanging out in a stale-smoke room, and like surly management, this is the place for you. Otherwise I strongly recommend that you avoid this place at all costs.

<Content>Competent Hotel Stayed one night on a business trip. Room was clean, bed comfortable. Lunch in their restaurant was good and service was fast when I said I was in a hurry. Area around the hotel is not too exciting - not many restaurants and you are right by I-635. But no problems with traffic noise - my room overlooked highway but I didn't hear it. Air conditioner was an annoyance - in-room unit which cycled on and off during the night. Front desk staff not very helpful with local knowledge. I asked for somewhere to go running and they sent me to a non-existent jogging trail. Also the pool is a lot smaller than it looks on their website (but isn't that always the case) Overall, I have no major complaints, though - this hotel gets the basics right, but that's about it.

<Content>Wyndham Dallas North by the Galleria Stayed at the Wyndham Dallas North by the Galleria for a business meeting. The facility is very nice -- the overnight rooms were good sized, very clean and well maintained. Extra pillows and blankets in the room, and super air conditioning.The bathroom soaps and shampoos were lovely to use, scented with lemongrass. Room service was fast. The food was fresh but not fantastic. Had an interesting salad with about 1/3 pound of blue cheese and a good balsamic vinagrette. Their breakfast buffet was fairly standard: a nice muesli with raisins, fresh fruit, dry cereal, eggs, biscuits and gravy. Better than average, but not amazing food. There is a coffee maker in the room. There was a $10.95 added charge for a high speed internet connection in the room. Their service staff was very helpful getting equipment set up in our meeting rooms.The location is very near the Galleria - an upscale shopping mall.
