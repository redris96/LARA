<Content>Just average Stayed in the Carolus Hotel for three nights in May this year on business and found it unimpressive.The room was very small and I was glad I was only there on my own, I think it would be too small for two people although it was a double.My room was at the front of the hotel but I wasn't disturbed by noise.There were a couple of issues with the room that although were not major were annoying. The bracket the shower was on was broken so it kept swinging round to the wall and I had to eventually hold it to have a shower. There were dirty marks on the walls and the top cover on the bed didn't seem clean.On the positive side the breakfast offered was good and service at breakfast time was efficient. The hotel is also in a good location and only about a ten minute walk from the main attractions.I will definitely return to Florence again but would not stay in the Carolus Hotel.

<Content>Underwhelming... and uncomfortable After reading some of these reviews, we had high hopes for our stay in Florence.The good stuff:The bell staff is very friendly and fluent in English.The view from our room was pretty.The location is convenient to most of the central Florentine sights.The bad stuff:Overall, the hotel is a dirty... the carpets in the hallways are stained, there was an abundance of mildew in the bath, and during the nearly week long stay they never replaced our towels. Upon our arrival, there was a blue  gold coverlet on the bed which was stained with white crusty stuff, It disappeared when the maid came the next day but they left us with just sheets for the rest of the week.It's uncomfortable: Exhausted from a long flight we collapsed onto a much too firm bed.Upon waking up, we attempted to shower, but without an actual shower curtain you're forced to cram towards the faucet so you don't wet the entire bathroom. Add to that the scalding hot surges of water from flushes elsewhere in the building and it makes bath time a little awkward. We were here on business, and the free wifi internet connection is very unreliable. The desk staff was apologetic, but conditions didn't improve so don't count on doing work online.Breakfast may be typical Italian, but the food is underwhelming although the room is beautiful and the staff is very nice.

<Content>excellent value and service My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in February 2008, and paid less than 拢50 per room per night, including a very decent continental breakfast. Room was comfy, air-con, satellite tv, staff all wonderful, including the bag man on arrival. Position good, we thought, a 5 minute walk to the action.If we return to Florence, which I think we will, we would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Not as nice as I expected We booked the Carolus on lastminute.com as one of the Top Secret Deals - meaning that we only got a brief description of the hotel, no specifics before booking, at which point you learn the details of where you'll be staying. The idea is that these hotels don't want their name published with such a low rate, leading one to believe that you're about to get a great deal. And we did get a good deal... but the description was a little misleading: Beautiful Hotel in a XIX century building! - 4* - FlorenceThis is an exceptional hotel, close to the most exclusive shops of this city. With the famous monuments and historic places nearby, this hotel has a great location in the centre of Florence. This contemporary property has been furnished with modern furniture and original art work. The lovely, spacious guestrooms and good facilities are perfect for both the leisure and business travellers.In REALITY this hotel is not close to the most exclusive shops in Florence at all, the shops surrounding it are small average locally owned businesses. The area with the exclusive shops is much closer to the river Arno and the center of the city. The furnishings are of average quality, a little staid - certainly not what I would expect from a four star hotel in Italy. The breakfast is nothing special - quite average for a European breakfast. (**Note to Americans - please don't be disappointed by the cold breakfasts offered in European hotels - this is what's called a Continental Breakfast and it is what most people on the continent actually eat in the morning!)The layout of the hotel lobby is awkward and leaves a good 50% of the lower level unused by my estimation. The breakfast room is located directly to the left of the large automatic entry doors and so if eating breakfast in the winter season one is subjected to strong blasts of frigid air every few minutes.Our room was just okay, probably comparable to an average American Holiday Inn. The real issue I had was with the bathroom, it was a tile covered box, I think in a medicinal blue color... the toilet sink and shower were all contained in the box without any separation - after taking a shower the entire room was soaking wet. Certainly not the luxurious and relaxing bathroom I was hoping for.Two of the lamps in our room were also missing light bulbs.The advantage of this hotel is that the location is pretty good - it is within walking distance of the train station and the center of Florence - BUT Florence is a small city and there are plenty of hotels in the center. Next time I'll be booking with one of them.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Wow, when we got to the hotel, there was a doorman to take our bags! We weren't expecting that. This hotel was great. The reception staff were friendly and helpful for eating  shopping tips. The rooms were a decent size, and clean. I couldn't quite get my bearings in Florence, but every time I thought that I was completely lost, I would look down the street and see the hotel. Close to the station, and actually walking distance to everywhere that we wanted to go. There are a couple of great wine bars down the road. The breakfast is fantiastic. Loved the hotel, loved Florence.

<Content>Great central location I stayed at the Carolus hotel in early October 2007 after booking a room online for 4 nights. The Carolus was just as described; a newer remodeled, small, personable hotel in a very convenient location. The hotel is located within easy walking distance (even with luggage) from the main train station (Santa Maria Novello) and the bus station. There is also a self-service laundry 1 street over and a dry cleaner in the same block. It is on a relatively busy street with some street noise but not overly distracting because the hotel had double paned windows to keep out the noise. The room I had (on the 3rd floor) was large with a large bathroom and a high ceiling. I read other reviews of people who had smaller rooms and I'm assuming it just depends on when you check in (season, day of week and time of day). I found the hotel to be clean, new and modern. I found the staff to be very friendly, helpful and willing to go out of their way to answer my tourist-related questions. I found the location to be wonderful because there was plenty of places to eat and drink after dark. Also, there were several Internet Cafes in the area charging only 1 Euro/hour to send and receive messages. This is an area that has many street stalls selling everything from food to clothing during the day, you really didn't have to leave the hotel area if you didn't want to. The tourist sites from the Ponte Vecchio to the Uffizi and Accademia museums are all within easy walking distance of the hotel.I arrived and departed on the Trenditalia (Train) from SMN and had no problem finding the hotel or getting to it with my luggage.The only problems I had were with the street noise (ask for a room facing away from the street when checking in), the small size of the shower and television and the fact that there was only 1 english language channel (CNN).

<Content>Average and Overpriced The Carolus Hotel is rated a four star property on Expedia but is actually, at most, an adequate three star hotel with four star prices. We took a bus from Pisa airport into Florence, 拢3, and the hotel is just a five minute cab ride, 拢6, from the bus station. (Buses are more reliable and more convenient than trains throughout Tuscany.) We could have walked to the hotel but the traffic is heavy and the sidewalks are narrow and very crowded. All the major museums and attractions are easily walkable from the hotel and there's a good range of shops and cafes nearby. We had a pleasant stay in room #208 for two nights, October 4 and 5. The room was large by European standards, clean and well presented. The bathroom was spacious, full sized bathtub, although the amenities were somewhat lacking in assortment. The towels were disappointingly thin and poor quality but the water pressure was strong and there was plenty of hot water at all times. The room was well air conditioned, and still needed in October, but we learned that not securely closing the bathroom window caused the A/C to shut off. We didn't use the mini-bar but we did take advantage of the extra space in the refrigertor to store our own water. The closet only had two hangers, I'm sure we could have asked for more but we simply made do. The two twin beds were small and the mattresses were very firm... perhaps a bit too firm. The view from the window, looking onto one of the smaller domes in the city, was lovely and the best aspect of this room. The buffet breakfast was rather plain: coffee, juices, cereal, various breads, cake, ham, cheeses and fruit. Cooked items are available at an extra cost but we didn't bother. We arrived at the hotel at noon and our room was available by 1:00pm. The reception staff, along with housekeeping and breakfast service were very good... friendly and professional. We liked this hotel well enough but nothing about it is 'four star'. I don't think we would consider staying here again. The hotel would benefit from some general maintenance, a fresh coat of paint on the walls would be a good start. The breakfast room and common areas are a depressing shade of pale blue and covered with spots, smudges and scuff marks... the entire property has a slightly neglected feel. Overall, at 拢125 per night, it wasn't good value for money and was our least favorite of the three hotels we visited in Tuscany.

<Content>very ok, except breakfast Plus;- Very friendly staff that speaks English and French. Always very graceful and helpful. - Nice, clean, modern hotel. - Quiet area, but only 10 min. walking from Duomo- Rooms in the back have a great vies over nice Italian houses and the Duomo.- Spacious bathroomMinus:- The room we got was rather small, a lot smaller than in the picture in the brochure of our travel agency. - If you're looking for a hotel with that old style charm en character, this is not for you. Hotel Carolus is a modern, but nice  clean hotel.- The breakfast is minimal, which is ok for me, but I found the fruit old and overripe, and the bread far from crispy. I thought this very strange for a 4-star hotel, especially considering there is a market just behind the hotel where you can find the freshest fruits. And in restaurants the bread is usually very good, so it's not a case of typical Italian bread or anything. To summarize, Hotel Carolus is a good choice, considering the price-quality relation. But I do not think it's worth 4 stars, due to the breakfast which was a lot less than satisfactory.

<Content>Little gem in Florence We stayed here for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon during the busy season, in August. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and only too happy to help with any query. The hotel is on a fairly quiet street which was lovely after a hard days sightseeing in the hustle and bustle of the city. Our room was at the back of the hotel and we had a lovely view of the Duomo. The room was very large (nothing special, it was just booked as double room), modern fixtures and fittings, the bathroom was quite big too, and had a bath and shower and was again very modern. The whole room was spotlessly clean. We would not hesitate to book this hotel again!

<Content>Lovely hotel and quiet Lovely hotel with floating floorboards which makes things very much cooler. The room was pretty big (we had room 310) and had a nice view from the room.There was free wifi and a mini bar, in room safe as well as a decent sized bath room. Call reception for the details of the wifi service.Air cond doesn't work if you open any of the windows, so remember to close both the bathroom and room one if you want the air cond to work.The continental breakfast was pretty good. Reception gave us a map of florence on arriving which was handy. Everything was pretty handy to the hotel as Florence isn't very big.We did a day trip to Siena via the SITA bus. The SITA station is near the main train station. Go towards the tourist information centre and head away from the main part of florence and you should see the SITA station on your right where the road forks. (We found it hard to find and walked around the station a few times!)

<Content>Good for a couple of nights in Florence Overall this was a good base for a few nights - only a 10 Euro taxi ride from the train station - you could easily walk in 10 minutes if you only had light luggage - and also about a 10 minute walk from the Duomo (cathedral) which is a lovely area with plenty of shops and (touristy) restaurants. (Get the hotel to recommend local restaurants - we liked Il Messere very much with its charming courtyard and the food is far superior to that in the touristy rip-off areas).It's a considerably longer walk to Ponte Vecchio - probably a good 20 minutes from the hotel but only ten minutes or so further than the Duomo so I didn't have a problem with that at all - I preferred being close to the Duomo.We found the staff helpful and friendly and the breakfast good enough to set us up for a few hours sightseeing.I would say that the standard room (we were given standard by mistake on our first night) was too small for a couple with 2 large cases - really not enough room/floor space to open both cases at the same time, but the deluxe was fine with a comfy sofa as well as reasonably sized bed  bathroom.We were on the first floor so our view was of tiled roofs immediately opposite but I gather you can have nice views from the 3rd floor.In summary this hotel is fine for a few nights, not luxurious and not 4 star by world standards but a good reasonably inexpensive (for Italy) tourist base.

<Content>The Good, Bad And Ugly This hotel is very attractive and on a nice wide street. It was doors away from my daughter's apartment where she is living for a semester abroad. The room was very small and our first room was on the street side, even though we had requested a room in the back when we booked. It was extremely noisy as we had to leave the windows open for air, since the air conditioning cannot be turned on until June. The next day we changed rooms because the door lock broke which turned out to be a good thing since we were moved to the back where it was much quieter. The problem here was again having to leave the window open for air which allowed for mosquitoes to invade us. We figured out that if we left the window open a bit and the shutters partically closed it kept the mosquitoes at bay. Luckily the weather was still pretty cool, especially at night. The room was attractively decorated and clean, and the shower had plenty of hot water. The mattress in both rooms we stayed in was horrible - the worst I ever slept on in any hotel ever!!The staff were all very helpful and all spoke very good English. The continental breakfast was also very good and you could purchase eggs and bacon for a reasonable price. The location was good and close enough to everything but yet away from the very crowded streets. I passed by some of the other hotels I considered and the Carolus appeared to be the better choice. The Hotel in general was good for the price and I did enjoy by stay, but they should invest in new mattresses.

<Content>"Very cramped room" The hotel was well maintained and in a good location with very courteous staff but our room was very cramped. We had been offered a disabled room in which the bathroom (wet room) was bigger than the bedroom. Our room was not big enough for the double bed in fact, there was not enough room to swing a cat. The room should have been designated a single.There was a lot of noise from the road outside despite double glazing. If you stay here ask for a room at the back of the hotel.The breakfast was perfectly adequate with no limitation on what you ate or drunk.

It was a perfect location, easy to walk everywhere and an excellent staff, all very friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but immaculate, in fact they put on clean sheets daily as well as fresh towels, etc. There is a safe to store valuables in each room. The shower has good water pressure and plenty of hot water . The breakfast is wonderful complete with perfect capuccino and a wide variety of foods. We would recommend this hotel with a smile and hope to return before too long.

<Content>Delightful experience We just returned yesterday from Europe and had a delightful experience staying for seven nights at the Carolus Hotel in Florence. The hotel was clean and attractive, occupying all four floors of a handsome nineteenth century neoclassical villa in a good neighborhood about fifteen minutes' walk from the train station and about twenty minutes' walk from the Ponte Vecchio. We picked it partly for its proximity to our daughter's home-stay location as she is doing a fall term in Florence. It is a five-minute walk to the Accademia (Michelangelo's David) and the San Marco Monastery Museum (world's greatest collection of Fra Angelico works--not to be missed). The distance to other sites is not significant in such a small historical district, but might be discouraging to the infirm or in the rain. We were blessed with splendid weather.An Internet Train location for checking email is one block away. (Turn right out of the hotel, then right again immediately by the laundry on the corner, which, incidentally, will do your laundry for you. The Internet Train is at the end of the long block on the left.) A charming little restaurant, Ristorante del Mimmo, is a block and a half away (turn right out of the hotel and then left on San Gallo), which is nice for that first jetlagged evening.The staff at the Carolus was most welcoming, competent, helpful, and English-speaking. The breakfast was a typical continental buffet with excellent coffee and juice, served in two pleasant, high-ceilinged rooms with large windows. Our room was on the back and was attractive, with a high ceiling, comfortable king-sized bed and such nice features as a locking safe in the wardrobe and a heated towel rack in the clean, modern private bath. Our view included the dome of San Lorenzo Church, which was beautifully lit at night. The hotel was quiet and attracted a nice group of guests, mostly European, during our November stay. Not a backpacker's hotel. We got a truly excellent off-season rate with an additional discount for our multiple-night stay. I recommend dealing directly via email with the hotel.We will definitely stay at the Carolus again.

<Content>good experience Have just returned from my third trip to Florence, staying this time at the Carolus Hotel.A very comfortable stay, room was nicely decorated with a decent size bathroom with a proper shower cubicle ( no paddling on wet floors !) All very up to date.Only let down was the breakfast room which cannot cope if hotel is fully booked.There are not enough tables or waiting staff-only two waiters and tables remained uncleared and you had to look for a waiter. However the hotel is very conveniently situated with local buses nearby if you need them.I was on the top (3rd) floor at the front and there is some street noise despite double glazing and shutters. The traffic dies off after 11pm so a good nights sleep is possible and there are some very pleasant views. The staff were very helpful and other than the breakfast problems I had a great stay and would return there if I can get a booking.Seems to be a very popular hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel The Hotel might be a few minutes from the historic center (about 7 minutes) it makes up for it in service and quiet comfort. I drove to Florence and having them garage my car for me ($20 euros a night) was worth every cent. I had no problems walking with a family of 5 (2 young teens and a 9 year old) to every possible sight and museum in Florence.We took a guided walking tour of the city and the Uffici museum. That helped to bring the history of Florence to a level that even my youngest child could appreciate.The place was roomy and clean. I would go there again. Ask for the rooms overlooking the Duomo!

<Content>Carolus Hotel- overpriced accomodations Carolus Hotel claims it is a 4* hotel.The location is several blocks from the Academia but to far from the Duomo  Ponte Vechio. We could of stayed on the Ponte Vechio for the same money and wish we had. While rooms were comfortable, they were nothing that would rank it above a 3* hotel. The room had a bathtub/shower with a partial screen that leaked all over the floor when used. Conseqeuntly had to use all our towels daily to clean up flooding. It was never fixed while we were there. The nicest thing about the room was the heated towel rack and the sunny yellow paint on the walls. The breakfast was fair, nothing special. The front desk people and all other staff were very nice and helpful on the few occasions we needed them. Overall, hotel was OK but overpriced and when we return to Florence in April we will stay in a hotel closer to the Ponte Vechio.

<Content>What a great place to stay! I stayed at this hotel for 7 days in mid-November, and it was one of the greatest hotel experiences that I have had in a long, long time.The desk staff and the bell staff are very friendly and very helpful. The breakfast buffet each morning was great too, although I did get a bit sick of prossuttio after awhile. There are plenty of options at breakfast though to help you change things up each morning.The rooms were bright and clean and well kept. I had a nice bed to sleep on, the bathroom was a good size, the shower worked great. They even turned down your bed each night which I thought was a nice touch. I also had a bowl of fresh fruit in my room when I checked in.This hotel is reasonably close to the train station. You shouldn't need to catch a cab as long as you do not have alot of luggage. I would definitely stay here again, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Central Location, helpful staff We stayed here with our infant daughter in November. The hotel is close to the train station and we have no difficulty making the short 10-15 mintues walk.It is within walking distance to most of the top attractions in Florence. The Academie is just about 10 minutes walk away. The Duomo is further at 20 minutes. Uffizi and ponte vecchio are about a leisurely 30 minutes walk away. You will probably spend the time window shopping among the many high-end boutiques on the way there!Rooms are of a nice size, among the bigger ones I have stayed in. Comfortable beds. We took a room towards the back of the hotel which is quiter. No bath, just a shower. Rooms and toilets are very clean and facilities well maintained.We noted a series of lounges on the ground floor wtih varies newspaper but hardly crowded in the evenin. Perhaps it was off season. Breakfast was a minor dissapointment though. Just rolls, crossoints, cereals, juices etc. Not much selection and the menu does not change in the 4 mornings we were there. Waiters were very attentive though.Counter staff was mostly helpful and would be able to book trips for you and provide directions if you haven't already figured out yourself from the helpful map.I will stay here again if I am passing through Firenze ever again.

<Content>a great place to stay My husband and I spent a week here recently. It was spotless, the room was comfortable, and the staff was both friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the breakfast every morning in the cheerful breakfast area. The hotel is a slightly longer walk from the main tourist area than some other hotels but it was convenient for walking to and from the train station and near a bus stop for Fiesole. We found several good restaurants in the area.We felt fortunate to have stayed here and would recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Florence.

<Content>Carolus a pleasant stay In late September 2005, we spent four nights at the Carolus Hotel in Florence. Overall, the experience was really just okay and I don't believe we would stay here the next time we visit Florence. We had just spent time in Rome and had terrific accomodations there, so the Carolus had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, they disappointed a bit. The room was large and furnished with a queen sized bed, a long couch, desk and a few chairs. There was a nice view from our window facing the Duomo and the back of people's houses. One inconvenience about the room was the location of the electical switches behind the bathroom door, which opened OUT into the room. The wardrobe doors opened into the same space and well, let's just say there was a lot of door banging going on. The bathroom was a riot! At first, it was aggravating but eventually, we just prepared for an experience with every use. First of all, the lighting seemed left over from the 1950's. Fluorescent bulbs created a dim view. There was limited space to plop down one's bathroom essentials and at one point, it got so frustrating with things falling off the sink, that I just put the stuff on the floor to save it a trip! The most hysterical part was the shower. The hotel used some antiquated folding (!) shower door which was useless. Every towel in the room was used to sop up the wet after every shower. Even with the hand held shower, the floor was soaked afterward. When you're still a little jet-lagged and exhausted from walking tours, the last thing you want to do is have a fist-fight with a shower door at 7 a.m.! A shower rod and curtain would have been a better alternative. The front desk staff spoke English but were not especially warm or friendly. The morning waitstaff, serving coffee at the breakfast buffet, were welcoming and efficient. The hotel's location was probably the best thing about it. We were within walking distance of several good restaurants, a laundry/dry-cleaners, shopping, the Accademia and the Duomo. The Carolus was quiet with limited street traffic. Overall, it was really just a clean place to sleep at night with no extraordinary services.

<Content>Carolus was perfect Just returned from four night stay in Florence at Carolus Hotel. Quite simply one of the best hotels I have stayed at in over twenty years of travelling. Whilst areas like the corridors were not the tidiest (scuff marks from suitcases) the rooms and general public areas were spotless and very comfortable. We stayed on the third floor and had a view over towards Fiesole which was excellent. The air conditioning worked well and was very quiet, the showere was hot and with good pressure. The bed was comfortable and was truned down in the evenings after we had gone out for dinner which was a nice touch as we generally followed the Florentine example and had a short rest after lunch.Checking in and out of this hotel was simply the best I have ever experienced. The desk staff were well informed, I had specified that I wanted a room on an upper floor and had requested they reserve me museum tickets, all of which was done without any fuss. Check-in took about a minute and check-out about thirty seconds - just brilliant!The area around the hotel was quite quiet, mainly residential with a couple of bars and restaurants however there were plenty of eating and drinking opportunities within five minutes walk in either direction from the hotel door.I would definatley stay here again and reccoment anyone to do likewise.

<Content>'An excellent choice' We have just returned after a very enjoyable six night stay at the hotel 'Carolus'. An excellent choice of hotel! The staff were all very welcoming, pleasant and helpful. Our room was spacious, extremely clean and a pleasure to come back to after a hectic day visiting all the wonderful sights Florence and the surrounding areas have to offer. My husband and I would definitely return and highly recommend this hotel to other visitors to the city. Excellent value for money.

<Content>Would Reccommend Excellent choice nice quiet room as requested,only 10 minute walk from the Accadamia.Staff very helpful.Suggest you have reception reserve tickets for the Uffizzi and Accadammia, saves the waiting especially in 80+ degrees.There is a small booking fee of 3 but if you are over 65 you get rebate of 4 euros.Enjoyed our 5 nights and the hotel was central enough to visit all of the the attractions.

<Content>nice place Very, very clean, beautiful room, I stayed as a single in a room in late March 2005. Service was very helpful, calling a cab, letting me store a bag for a day when I took an overnight trip to Rome, I payed 95 euro/night. Breakfast had, besides the usual croissants and jam, a ton of fresh fruit, juices, granola, and nutella!My only complaint would be that even shutting and sealing the windows, the fraffic outside woke me up repeatedly during the nights. I hear this is the case all over florence wherever you go, and I wouldn't be surprised. Bring earplugs. I love walking all around so its location at the extreme north end of the city proper was fine for me.

<Content>Wonderful Weekend Have just returned from a most enjoyable weekend in Florence. The Carolus turned out to be an excellent choice in a great location. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was spotless, beds comfortable and bathroom well equipped. I am looking forward to staying there again in the future.

<Content>A Wonderful Stay Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Carolus Hotel. The service was top notch. We arrived at the hotel around 12:45pm (a bit early for check-in) and was greeted warmly. Although the room was not ready, we were escorted to a comfortable seating room and was offered a pot of coffee. Nice touch for us weary travelers. We had just flown in from NY through Rome and had just taken the Eurostar to Florence from the Termini station. Our room was ready in about 15 minutes. Was pleasantly surprised by the layout of the room (shaped like a U), with wood parquet floors, separate desk and writing area, and modern bathroom, with a towel warmer. Room was extremely clean, and elegantly furnished (not over the top). Conveniently located, within walking distance to the Academia (Il Centro supermarket located across from the Academia for basic essentials, i.e. water, soda, juice.) Beware the mosquitos though. Florence in general is notorious for mosquitoes year round. Windows, although shuttered, had no screens to keep those critters out. Don't leave them open overnight or they'll eat you alive. :) Breakfast buffet included in price. Nice selection of proscuitto, ham, cheeses, croissants, rolls, cereal, jams and Nutella (my favorite!!). Although it does get boring after 5 days. :) There are only so many ways one can eat proscuitto and cheese, and cheese and proscuitto. :) But the wait staff was wonderful and attentive. Good coffee as well.Thanks to the front desk and reception, who helped us out when we forgot our universal adaptor and lent us one for our stay. When we booked the Carolus, we relied on the positive comments from other tripadvisor users. Thanks for all your feedback and comments.

<Content>Great location We stayed in the Carolus in July 2004 in 2 rooms for 3 nights. The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were cleaned twice a day. Air conditioning worked perfectly, which we needed that week. Excellent location - short walk to all the attractions, but not too close so avoiding the worst of the noise. But don't expect peace and quiet - a number of bars and restaurants nearby. We were on the first floor, so maybe quieter higher up, and we live in a forest so are used to silence! Overall, I would recommend to anyone travelling to Florence.

<Content>Second Time-Very Good Decision I got back to Hotel Carolus one year later and stayed five nights in August of 2004. I paid Euro 105 per day for a single room. To me it is a reasonable price by considering the hotel's quality.All staff has always a kind smile on their face. And they are very helpful when you need any information. In my opinion, housekeeping is also very good. My room was very clean as last year. Surprisingly enough, they make even a second turn in the evening when you are out and if necessary they change your towel etc. This year I grabbed a room with a good view; part of the city, roofs and the mountains.As in the last year, air conditioning in the room and in the lobby was very good. The service in the breakfast room is decent and the staff is very kind. To me breakfast was sufficient by especially considering my experience in some other four star hotels. This time I decided to give the name of some restaurants I liked.For a tasteful dinner, you can try one of these restaurants: Ristorante Ottorino (good service, good food, very near to Duomo - Tel:055.21.87.47), Tavernetta Della Signoria (small place, but superb food - Tel: 055.28.89.51), Ristorante I Quattro Amici (around 15 minutes walk from the center, especially fish - Tel: 055.21.54.13), Don Chisciotte (near to Carolus, especially fish, but unfortunately mostly closed in August - Tel:055.47.54.30).In summary, I suggest Hotel Carolus to all of my friends in my circle without any hesitation. And I hope to come back again.
