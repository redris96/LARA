<Content>Great Stay We stayed the night before our flight out of Boston Logan. The staff was extremely helpful from the font desk to the shuttle drivers. The shuttle was on time and comfortable. The room was spacious and we would definately stay here again.

<Content>Boston South The hotel was nice, short 5 minute walk to the T Redline or if shuttle is around, they will drop you off. Rooms were nice size and bed comfoprtable. Pool, is small only 3 and 4 feet deep. Free parking is always a plus in boston. Cookies were great. Overall a great stay and would stay again.

<Content>Great experience at Courtyard Marriott South Boston My daughter and I just came back from Boston and we had a great time. The hotel staff was consistently nice and helpful. We arrived pretty late our first night, around 11pm or so. I know sometimes with shift changes, staff can get a little cranky, but they were friendly and helped us right away, to find a place to order food from. The next morning my daughter and I were having trouble working the bath and shower, thinking there might be a problem. I called downstairs and someone came up within a matter of minutes. Come to find out it was just me being a little dim. My only complaint (if you can even call it that, it's more of an observation) would be is that the hotel is in a quirky area. It just seems odd that there are two big hotels in this residential area, plus our view wasn't pretty. Otherwise the hotel staff was great, the rooms were affordable, clean and very comfortable. Also it was minutes away from Andrews Station (T). The front person gave us walking directions. I would totally stay here again.

<Content>Good choice RECOMMENDED: Check in fast despite arriving behind the complimentary airport shuttle bus. Very helpful staff during stay. Large modern updated decor rooms with nice baths, comfortable bedding and well illuminated baths. Free internet. Short walk to metro (though not the best of neighborhoods), plenty of free parking and a nearby shopping center. A good choice for a visit to Boston. Negatives: Almost impossible to get a taxi to pick you up here (though drop off not a problem).

<Content>Nice hotel for the price My girlfriends and I stayed here for the weekend and were very happy. I was the first to arrive so I can set up our room for my friend's bachelorette party and when I went into my room I had a view I wasn't happy with. It was directly aligned with the vents so that's all you saw when you opened the curtains. I was in a rush and the staff behind the desk were very nice enough to switch our room for a better view of the city. The room was very nice and clean and I really loved the decor. The beds were extremely comfortable and come with 5 comfy pillows on each one. The bathroom was nice and the shower had a bench in it which was a bonus (3 girls with LOTS of toiletries to hold)! The pool was open until 11pm which was great! It was not quite deep enough (about 4ft) but it was def nice to swim in and very clean.  For the price it was a great deal. It's right outside the city but it only takes about 10 minutes to get to Boston's fun destinations. Next time I come to Boston I'm probably going to stay somewhere within walking distance to everything, but I would def consider staying here again.

<Content>Smooth start/end point for trips We've done the Park  Fly several times now out of this Courtyard with fine results every time. The rooms/furnishings are typical Courtyard, very clean, well maintained and spacious enough for our needs. The shuttle service to/from the airport is quick and reliable; only problem we've had was with PM front desk person not properly logging in our wake-up or shuttle service request last time and the AM desk person was surprised when we showed up for the morning shuttle service and informed him we'd not received a wake-up call either. Fortunately he was able to gin up a van for us in less than 5 minutes and we were off to the airport on time. Excellent performance under pressure.

The hotel has a maximum guests of 4 but we're a family with 3 young kids. no problem at chek in. We took the package with breakfast (10$ more ) which was great cause the kids eat for free.We felt very safe walking to the T station.I'll recommend this hotel .

<Content>Great Hotel except for Checkin Staff Overall, the hotel is really nice, clean, very easy walk to the subway.The only negative I would have to stay was our experience checking in. We arrived on a red-eye flight on Saturday, 8/9. I wanted a room to check in that early so I made reservations for Friday, 8/8. I sent the Courtyard Marriott an email back in July that although we have a room for 8/8, we wouldn't be checking in until very early 8/9 so NOT to cancel our room.I then called the hotel directly on Monday, 8/4 to confirm our 'late' arrival. We received written and verbal confirmation that they would make a note of our early Sat. arrival and that they would not cancel our room.Upon arriving to the Courtyard South Boston on the morning of 8/9, we checked in with the night supervisor (wish I wrote down his name) and another employee named Dan. I said Good Morning to them and neither acknowledge my greeting. The Night Supervisor looked up my info and said coldly, You were supposed to check in yesterday so we canceled your room. I told him I called AND have written confirmation (which I showed him) that we were checking in early 8/9 instead of 8/8. They did eventually get us a room but neither employees were apologetic or courteous. While this did not ruin our trip, it left a negative feeling about the hotel since they were the 1st 2 people we encountered. They treated me as if it was all my fault.If anyone does what we did re: getting 2 nights with late check-in due to a redeye flight, make sure you confirm at least THREE times. Obviously, one written email  one phone call is not enough.

<Content>Great location Stayed for one night. Excellent location - about a 5 minute walk from the Andrew Sq T station. Check in was very quick, although the clerk spoke very fast and not very clearly. The room was clean and comfortable. Bedding was great! When I made my reservation, I asked for extra pillows and they were there waiting for me. The breakfast buffet didn't look very inviting for $13 so we went to Bickfords which was in the same parking lot. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice room  The hotel itself was very nice. The room was clean and well appointed. The hotel provides free transportation to/from the airport and the subway is an easy 5 minute walk. And since we stayed for a week and didn't have a car, it was also convenient to have a shopping center within walking distance.We did have a couple of bumps in our stay though...The ride from the airport was only 10 minutes but unfortuantely it was a 40 minute wait before we were picked up. We had a problem with the ride back to the airport as well. We called the front desk the night before to request pick up in the lobby at 9:30am, unfortunately, our ride left without us because our name wasn't on the list for pick up for some reason. I have to say, the front desk clerk was very sympathetic and sprung to action. He called a cab company and said the hotel would pick up the tab. And when the cab company was taking too long, he arranged for another staff member to drive us in the hotel van...so we made our flight in time.Our only other complaint was the breakfast. The food was mediocre and overpriced, and the service was terrible.Overall, all that being said, I still would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great value!! Stayed here for a long weekend with friends while the Yankees were in town. I was a little hesitant, because it was out of the action, but there was nothing disappointing about this Courtyard. The location was great -- the Andrew T-stop was a 5 minute walk away, making it easy to get into the city and transfer to the various lines. The hotel grounds were very well maintained and the rooms were decently sized.We had one problem with the air conditioner in our room the first night (it wasn't working), but I asked the front desk to send an engineer up to look into it the next morning, and by the time we returned Friday night, the room was completely cool and we didn't have any problems for the rest of the stay. ALL the staff was very friendly. The front desk staff even remembered my name when I would come down to the lobby. That's near impossible to find these days. They were helpful with maps, finding late night delivery dining, small inconveniences, etc. You name it, they can handle it, and with a smile! The hotel offers a free shuttle to the airport every half hour on the hour. This was a great ammenity and had a lot to do with my decision to stay at this property.You won't be disappointed.

Staff was very helpfull and freindly. Hotel located just of I-93 south, 5 minutes south of downtown. You can also walk in less than 5 minutes to Andrew Station (subway). The hotel has a small but clean pool area. I will stay there again if going to Boston.

<Content>Great Value Hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel from July 3, 2008 until July 6, 2008 in room 633. Overall, we were very pleased with the accommodations and would definitely stay here again.Our stay started off well. We called for the free shuttle van pick-up from the airport and it arrived within about 15 minutes, the time it takes to get to the hotel. The hotel appears to have been built recently and most everything looked new. Check-in took about 1 minute and we were given a room on a high floor, which had a nice view of the Boston skyline (we were able to watch the fireworks from our window). The room was only average-sized, but was very clean and had all the basic amenities you might need. The room temperature was controlled by a digital thermostat and the AC worked great. The television had a very large channel selection. The bed was comfortable, but I鈥檝e slept on softer mattresses at other Courtyards before. The pillows were soft and numerous. The bathroom was very clean and of average size. The room also had a refrigerator and the carpeting and sheets appeared to be very new.This hotel is not in the downtown area, but we got a very good rate for that very reason. The Andrew T stop was only a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and just two stops from downtown Boston. It is very possible to be in downtown Boston within 15-20 minutes from the moment you walk out of your hotel room. For this minor inconvenience you can save a lot of money on your hotel room and not have to pay for a taxi from the airport. I found the area to be quite safe and the comments from other reviewers about the area are overblown. Right next door to the hotel is a shopping center where you can eat at Applebee鈥檚, Olive Garden, or shop at Stop N Shop, Target, Marshall鈥檚, Best Buy, or Old Navy. We recommend taking the 16 bus from the Andrew station (or in front of the Stop N Shop) to the Franklin Park Zoo (contrary to the sign at the corner of Washburn and Boston Streets, it does not stop there). Adult admission is only $12.00 and the bus ride was 15 minutes. The hotel also had a nice pool and hot tub area that was open until 10:00 pm every night. The pool water was not cold and the hot tub temperature was just right. The staff was very friendly. When I asked if there was a microwave in the lobby area, the concierge offered to have one delivered to my room, which they did 10 minutes later. The hotel also had two free internet stations for guests to use and a free coffee stand. We did not use the fitness room, which was open 24/7. Maid service was excellent. The grounds were nicely landscaped and impeccably clean.I鈥檓 not sure what I paid per night. I purchased a vacation package on Priceline.com (4 days/3 nights, fees, taxes, and roundtrip airfare for 2 from NYC for only $660.00 total). I just know I got a very good rate and I would absolutely stay here again. This was not the Four Seasons, but it was a great value for the accommodations we received.Marc T. Hardekopf

<Content>Very nice hotel I wanted a place to stay that was inexpensive and close to a subway station so I could sight-see in Boston. This place fit the bill as it was only $99/night with AAA discount. The hotel is in an ok area. I didn't feel scared in anyway. There is a shopping center very close by and the subway station is about 3 blocks away (close enough to walk). There is also a free shuttle to/from the airport which we didn't use. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wanted a place to stay that is close to downtown Boston and isn't over-priced.

<Content>OK, but strange area The hotel is nice. Rooms are clean! Beware though this hotel is in a strange area. We were told that the hotel was very close to the metro station; however it is three blocks. I know this does not sound like its far, but you have to walk through a residential area and over a bridge. We had small children and felt uncomfortable coming back at night. The metro station near the hotel is not the best, smelled of urine and a little scary for families. The front desk was nice and did give us a free breakfast for not being as 'truthful' as we thought.

<Content>An great base for a holiday The free shuttle bus from Logan airport got us off to a good start. The check in was a bit 'off hand' but over the next week we found he was the exception as the other staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was substantial and good food; the room large and very clean; the nearby restaurant 224 very good; Andrew T station less than ten minutes away so our 1 week T pass for $15 was well worth it.The free internet [2 computers] and hot drinks [near reception] was a nice touch. I would return to this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>Very good all-around hotel in a weird location Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Boston South for my first ever trip to Boston. Was looking forward to the hotel after reading the rave reviews and was prepared for the location away from downtown. The shuttle service was pretty fast at picking us up from Logan and took us straight to the hotel. We were informed that the shuttle only runs to the airport, and would not run us to downtown. However, the front desk staff had in-depth, printed directions on how to walk to the nearest train station (Andrew) which was only five minutes away. The area around the hotel was somewhat quirky. It was semi-industrial and residential, and located close to a huge shopping centre with a Target and Old Navy. We walked to downtown on Massachusetts Ave several times, and even though it was a somewhat run-down area, we didn't feel unsafe or in harms way. However, there were homeless people and a meth clinic along the way, so it is somewhat dodgy. The walk to the train station was easy and very safe.The rooms were very clean and in good shape. Beds were comfortable, the pillows were perfect, and the decor was nice. The views weren't great, and were mostly of the 93, but we weren't in the room enough to care. The only other quirk was a lack of blankets on the beds. Nights can be a little chillThe staff was very helpful and was always polite and courteous. The accomodated us by holding our luggage after check out until our evening flight and arranged for Enterprise-Rent-A-Car to deliver a car for us at the hotel. Huge kudos to them! Another HUGE perk was plentiful free parking, which wouldn't be possible in a downtown hotel.Finally, the restaurant had a breakfast buffet that was $12.95 and considering that it was a hotel restaurant (where prices are usually exagerrated), it wasn't a bad deal. There were waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, cereals, muffins, fruit, and bagels. The waitress was interesting. The first day we ate there she was extremely attentive and was very fast. She had excellent service and was very friendly. The second day we ate there she was stressed over an issue in the kitchen as we would hear her screaming in Spanish in there, and was forgetful of our orders and dumped all her personal problems on us. Not the most relaxing breakfast.Overall, the Marriott Courtyard was an excellent hotel with clean rooms, wonderful front-line staff, and stellar service. The location wasn't a huge deal for us, but if you get nervous of dark streets with homeless people, then it's not a good walk, but the train is close enough.

<Content>Suprisingly not impressed Though still far better than the discount hotel chains, this is the worst Courtyard I've stayed in. The room stunk and it was a little confusing to find the entrance. Fortunately I only had to stay one night. I will pay a bit more for another brand in the Marriot chain next time I鈥檓 in the area.

<Content>A hidden gem Above average Courtyard - from a traveller who is afraid of anything other than a 4 Seasons or a Ritz, this hotel, with its Park/Sleep/Fly package, is a great option if you have an early morning flight out of Logan. Built about 3 years ago, the rooms are Marriot grade, well above typical Courtyards. Shuttle prompt  friendly, even at 5 am. Lobby coffee ready at that hour, as well. 7 minute walk to the T, but you won't want to walk it at night - daytime is fine. Suburban style strip mall right behind the hotel is convenient for kids - Target, Old Navy, Applebees  Olive Garden are all right there. This hotel could easily be branded a Marriot, and may be once they put the planned full service restaurant into the lobby.

<Content>Great Hotel , Great staff for the most part We checked in the hotel for one night on March 10th. Arrived at Logan and shuttle was at the airport to pick us up 20 minutes after we called. We arrived at the hotel and there was one front desk agent. She never greeted us , never said anything really. I finally said we wanted to check in . She said name, never looking at me. Then she asked for my credit card, again never looking at me, never recognizing me as a silver elite, nothing. She gave me my credit card back , handed me my key , and never said a word. She didnt tell me the room number, she didnt say anything , I asked for the room number and she pointed at the key pack. We were hoping the whole experience would not be as cold and unfriendly as this one woman was. We got in the room. It was very nice, clean and spacious. Throughtout the rest of the stay , the other front desk staff and other staff members of the hotel were very friendly and attentive, which is why I will not let this one person spoil my review for the hotel. Thats why i ranked it excellent. Everyone else went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure we were satisfied. Thanks Courtyard South Boston.

<Content>Great Hotel but Transitional Neighborhood I travel extensively for work, and stay at Marriott-brand properties about 125 nights a year. I've learned what to expect from these hotels.This Courtyard is one of the nicest I have stayed in, anywhere. From the outside, it's really beautiful and upscale, MUCH moreso than you'd expect from this brand. The lobby and pool and also really beautiful.My room was standard-issue Coutyard 2007, meaning lots of creamy wallpaper, attractive furniture, and a nice bed. The bathroom was also great. The room was sparkling clean.Overall, the property itself is terrific....BUT, step off the property and it's a different story. It's located in one of those neighborhoods that realtors politely call transitional. Looking out of the hotel in one direction is an old factory that looks like it's been abandoned for decades, the back of a Best Buy in the other direction, the hotel parking lot in a third direction, and the back of an old Howard Johnson's in a fourth direction. I got lost a few blocks from the hotel, and when I called for help, the front desk person asked if I was next to the projects. Next door to the hotel is a really nice, new Power Center mall with a Target, Best Buy, Olive Garden, supermarket, Applebee's, etc. The convention center is also a fairly close drive, especially if you learn the back route to get there.It seems as though the city has worked hard to redevelop this area, but the hotel and the adjacent strip mall are about the only bright spots for many blocks in all directions.Loved the hotel, but the location kills the place. What a pity.

<Content>Clean rooms, great value, excellent customer service My room at the Courtyard South Boston was extremely clean as well as roomy and well appointed. The wireless internet was fast and easy to access. The fitness room was small but adequate, and all of the equipment was in good repair. Possibly the most memorable aspect of my stay was the helpfulness and courtesy of the staff. The shuttle bus drivers were kind enough to drop me off at the closest metro stop (about a 10-minute walk away) on several occasions and also pick me up from the station. I also used the complimentary airport shuttle and was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the shuttle arrived at the airport. I'll definitely consider staying here again on my next Boston trip!

<Content>Excellent value and location -- we will be back! My wife and I stayed in the Courtyard by Marriott South Boston, 63 R Boston Street, Boston, MA 02125, for almost two weeks in August, 2007. The staff was friendly and helpful, the price was reasonable for a large city, and the room was spacious, well maintained, clean, and had free WiFi. The subway is a five minute walk away, and a shopping mall with an Olive Garden and Chili's Restaurant is located directly behind the hotel. The shopping mall also has a Target, Circuit City, and supermarket among many other stores. Other eating places are within walking distance, but were more expensive and/or of unknown quality so we avoided them except for one which was expensive and not very good. We took the subway to the suburbs like the Harvard area or downtown for evening meals on many days and were well satisfied. We typically had breakfast in the hotel dining room which was very good, but somewhat pricey. The hotel has a shuttle service which was useful and if you tip well the drivers may stretch the rules and go well above and beyond in being helpful and getting you where you want to be!

<Content>A great Place to Stay for young ones! My wife and two young girls (6 and 9) as well as another couple with kids close to the same age arrived in Boston on Dec 30 for a couple of nights and a Boston Bruins game. After an 8 hr drive the staff at the front desk were great. They were very friendly and things were handled quickly. Our rooms were basic but clean and nice. The pool is very easy to access through the lobby and we immediately went there with 4 young ones. The pool was a little small for them, however, that was ok. (be careful though it is a little slippery on the deck...why pools do that???) The kids like the pool regardless. We felt very at ease there and even brought a few beer (in cans) to sip on while kids were in pool and we sat in hot tub. As for getting around Boston and to the game, front desk had a little direction sheet telling us how to walk to the TTC or 'T' as they call it. It was about a 10 minute walk (if that) to the 'T' and before we knew it we were at the Bruins game. Not only were the people nice at the hotel, everyone we talked to in Boston were very very friendly. After the game, some police officers gave us directins to Cheers and we had a ball! MInd you everything is a two minute walk to Boston people... perhaps the Boston Marathon mentality? A little long of a walk, but my 6 yr old handled it on a chilly New Years Eve.The breakfast was fantastic. The nice man at the front desk gave us a deal for the first morning since we were so 'nice' haha and had such a long drive. It was a buffet and 'Mercedez', the waitress, is fantastic. Thank you for everything Mercedez! Needless to say, a very healthy and tasty breakfast.The only problem with the hotel is the tricky spot it sits and trying to find it. It is located behind a mall, and if you see a sign for Holiday Inn, then that is it. Courtyard needs a BIGGER SIGN!!!!Other than that, a great stay! thanks Boston Chris Shannon[--] would be happy to tell more

<Content>Comfortable stay We were in town for a Friday night wedding in Boston Harbor Hotel. I booked our room directly from the Marriott website for the same price as Hotwire and Expedia ( but ,without their extra fees= $79. + tax). I also received a AAA discount and extra Marriott reward points, as well. The first room was beautiful, but had a very noisy heater. The manager responded immediately and gave us another room with a city view. The staff were helpful giving us driving directions into the city using access roads to avoid rush hour traffic. Next day we found a perfect breakfast stop:Victoria's Diner on 1024 Mass. Ave. that had the best tasting veggie omelts, home fries, coffee---it seems this diner has been a local favorite for almost 60 years.

<Content>Great value Hotel. We got a great non-changeable rate of $189+ tax, when the rest of the Boston chain hotels seemed to be $300+. Good start when the free shuttle was at Logan to pick us up within a few minutes from phoning them from the courtesy phone.Hotel is right next to a Holiday Inn Express, which I believe is owned by the same franchise. It is also next door to the very big South Bay Shopping Complex, which features Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, Super Stop 'n' Shop, to name but a few - one good tip is that there is a free shuttle bus running between the shopping plaza and the Andrew T station - very good, especially if you have luggage.The hotel itself is fairly new and a typical Courtyard - very clean, not too roomy, but adequate. Free wi-fi and coffee in the lobby and free wired internet in the rooms. Staff were courteous and helpful.The area isn't too bad, no signs of graffiti or gang tags in what appeared to be a mainly Polish neighbourhood during the 10 minute walk to the T station.There is a Bickford's diner next to the hotel, and an Olive Garden and Applebee's in the shopping complex.All in all a good alternative to the mega prices of the city centre, but you are a bit 'out of the action'. Would have no problem staying there again.

<Content>Good except out of the way The hotel itself is new and therefore clean and well-maintained. Courtyard is a budget line of Marriott properties. Nice desk, bed, TV, A/C, bathroom, etc.The hotel is about a 10-minute walk from the Andrew T-stop. Once there, downtown is quick. The restaurant situation near the hotel is inadequate. Room service from a nearby restaurant ends at 10:00 pm. We got to the hotel at 9:45 pm. (The food itself was way overpriced relative to quality.)

<Content>Fantastic stay Excellent choice if you will be attending conventions at the BCEC. The courtesy shuttle saved us a good bit in taxi fares to and from the BCEC and the airport. Rooms are big and clean and the staff wasalways helpful. About a $10-$12 cab ride to other areas of Boston such as the North End and Copley Square. The Target behind the hotel was convenient to pick up necessities and snacks.

<Content>Great choice if travelling with car i got a great rate and was looking for a place that i could park free and get around easily. this was right off rt93 and the 3 treks i made into the city on fri night,sat and sun morning to the childrens museum, aquarium and harbor were very driveable.the kids and i enjoyed the pool and work out area.breakfast was not included with my rate but there's a nice diner in an adjacent parking lot and a grocery store right behind. would have liked a microwave in the room but other than that, this hotel exceeded all our needs. would definitely book again.

<Content>Nice clean hotel, but not a great location for us We stayed at the hotel at the start of August. The staff were generally very friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and clean. We had no complaints about the hotel itself other than the location. As two young British women, we found the neighbourhood wasn't good - even during the daytime. We were accosted by people regularly just on the walk to the T. We didn't feel particularly safe and it wasn't a great location for a holiday hotel when you don't have a car. ( We stayed later at the Holiday Inn Select, Government Centre, which was much better - It was central, you could walk pretty much everywhere and the Beacon Hill area was really nice too).

<Content>Great hotel Unlike the Sheraton Hotel in Framingham, I had a great experience here. The room was excellent, clean and quiet. The staff was great. They were very friendly and answered all the questions I had about how to get around Boston. The hotel is close to the T which is the best way to get around Boston. The hotel is also close to a shopping center with Target, Olive Garden, and AppleBee's. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone. And if I go back to Boston, I'd stay there again! LOVED IT!

<Content>We'll be back! We recently stayed at this hotel for six nights and really liked it - especially the proximity to the T (Boston's subway line). It was about a 10 minute walk to the subway with two small kids in tow, probably faster for unencumbered adults. It is 3 subway stops away from a centrally located subway stop called Downtown Crossing.The room with 2 Queen sized beds was generous enough size-wise to allow our energetic 3 year old to run back and forth. Bathroom was clean. Trademark Marriott sparkling linens adorned the beds.One thing we really like about the Marriott chain is that they are entirely smoke-free.The only thing we didn't like about the hotel was the expensive breakfast - was about $12 per adult and they charge for all kids ($7 for kids). At other Marriotts that we have stayed at, kids under 4 eat free. But, there is a wonderfully divey diner nearby (Bickford's, right behind the adjacent Holiday Inn), which serves the best French Toast and is much more reasonably priced (although their coffee leaves something to be desired!).

<Content>Great hotel.. This was our second stay at the Courtyard South Boston this year. The hotel is an excellent pre-vacation choice for its park, sleep and fly package. The facility is extremely clean and very well appointed. Food and shopping are within walking distance. Very comfortable lounge, pool, and outdoor gazebo areas. Parking area security has greatly improved after earlier vandalism problems (we were a victim in February). I would definitely recommend.......

<Content>great price,staff was less than helpful Great price ok location for Boston BUT the booking was for adjoining rooms and the staff just blew us off. The desk staff would not negotiate or try to find a solution to our request. The closest they could come was 4 floors away. I had made the request in the initial booking, called the hotel before we arrived, and then at arrival. When our second party arrived the next day and tried to get the adjoining room in the morning it was not ready. By afternoon it wasn't available. In addition we were told the complimentary shuttle ended at 10PM BUT after some interceding from the bartender, Jen, they came clean that it did run on request(think they had trouble with getting a driver to work after 10) The shuttle arrived 45 minutes after we called (its a 10 minute trip). Saturday evening at 8:45 PM we went for a nightcap in their lounge only to find the bar closed. All in all the staff seemed to be able to make up the times and accommodations to suit their needs instead of the guests!

<Content>Very Nice Hotel My family and I stayed at the Marriott two nights in June because we flew in and out of Logan. My daughters loved their waffles in the morning! The pool is kind of small but the workout room is pretty nice. My wife is very particular and she found the rooms very clean! The staff was very helpful and friendly. You can tell they want their guests to have a nice time there. The area around the hotel is fine. We had a car so we drove up RTE 93 about 2 miles to get to Fanuel Hall (a 5-8 minute drive-not during rush hour though). Fenway is also only 2-3 miles away so it is a short drive to the center of Boston. We felt very safe there and I would stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel! My cousin and I stayed at this hotel July 4-8. We both loved it! The hotel still looks new. The rooms were large. The beds were wonderful! The staff was very friendly. The hotel has a shuttle that will take you to/from airport. It will also drop you off at the subway if you're just too tired to walk. Andrew Station (subway) is only about a 5 minute walk. The subway systems are very user friendly. We also did the Old Town Trolley which did come to this hotel of a morning to pick you up. Directly behind the hotel was a shopping area - Target, Old Navy, etc. and also, two restaurants - Olive Garden and Applebee's. The hotel is about a 10 minute cab ride to downtown - the fare ran between $8 - $12. We used the subway during the day and usually took a cab back of an evening. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Boston and would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Modern and convenient We stayed at the Courtyard last summer and were very pleased with theoverall experience. Altough the hotel is located in an entanglement of one-ways, it is new, modern and conveninent. The beds are very comfortable and the room was lager than I expected. The American breakfast is was well appreciated and the waffles loved by the kids. The Courtayd Marriott surely made our trip to Boston enjoyable.

<Content>Really Good Deal at a 3 Star Hotel in Boston Just returned from a 3 night Boston getaway. My husband and I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott South Boston. We found a AAA rate of $89 a night on the internet. We found the staff friendly and helpful, our room was quite nice, with modern amenities, very comfortable beds and a fridge. Coffee and tea available at all times, and guest access to the computer and internet in the lobby (although a second computer would be even more helpful due to its popularity).The hotel, while not in the center of Boston, was convenient for us because it is only a 5 minute walk to the Andrew Red Line T subway station. We felt safe walking there, although the neighborhood is not in the ritziest part of town. We had 1 problem on checkout, however. Upon reviewing our receipt, we noticed that we were charged for 2 breakfast meals although we didn't have any. Apparently someone had charged the 2 meals to our account . My husband thinks it might be an inside job because the forger had our name and room number information. In any case, the clerk took off the charge. We plan to follow-up with Marriott, since the clerk at the hotel didn't appear concerned about the incident.Considering how expensive hotels can be in Boston, we felt we got a really good deal at a 3 star hotel.

<Content>Very good hotel We booked this hotel for the last night of our vacation using our Marriott rewards points. We didn't expect much but it actually turned out great. The bed was comfortable, the room was nice and the restaurant nearby they suggested at the front desk was excellent. We used the computer to map our way to a few places and were able to use the printer there for free.

<Content>Very nice hotel but customer service needs work. We chose this hotel because of the great reviews on tripadvisor and the free parking  internet.This is definitely a great hotel to stay at if you plan on renting a car for your stay. There is plenty of parking (free!) and the T station is about a 10 minute walk. There is a big plaza right behind the hotel with a bunch of box stores (Best Buy, Marshall's, Target, Home Depot, Circuit City), a supermarket, and a couple of restaurants (Applebee's and Olive Garden).The hotel rooms are big, clean, and very nice. The internet is also free and the connection is fast. The one weak point of the hotel is the customer service. I went to the front desk four or five times during my stay: once to check in, a few times to ask for information/advice, and once to check out. Not once was there actually somebody at the front desk. I have no idea why the staff there like to hide in the back office and not be out in front. Customers build up in front of the front desk like idiots wondering where the heck the staff are.The housekeeping staff don't get around to making up your room until 2:30pm depending on where your room is. Small things: they didn't have any razors or tea.Overall, this is structurally and location-wise an excellent hotel for the price. If they can improve their customer service, it could truly be an excellent hotel.

<Content>GREAT! CLOSE! VERY NEW! Highly Recommend This was a great hotel for it's price. It has brand new everything, and is very clean, neat, and big. I was not expecting every room to be huge, but for a room I got at a discounted webrate price (checkout their hotel website), it had a california king bed with down and clean crisp white linens, a foldout couch w/ bed, a desk w/ a moveable table, plus more! For anything we needed, the front desk did not hesitate to supply it to us. Also, VERY QUIET and VERY COMFORTABLE for someone who is looking for a good night's rest. Each room has a digital thermostat w/ wonderful air conditioning and heat. Also, despite what one hotel employee told me, the hotel DOES have FREE internet in their guestrooms. I was not able to access it wirelessly, but I plugged the cord into my laptop and it worked great with a little help from their toll-free support tech's. The only thing I would ask for that was not provided was a continental breakfast. But we survived with the Dunkin Donuts on your short walk to the T (Subway) Red Line (Andrew Square stop), so it was worth the cheap price that the hotel was to pick up bagels and coffee for breakfast. On a side note, the walk is not even a 1/2 mile to the T, which is easy to figure out to take, I recommend it for a cheap way to reach downtown Boston, i.e. Quincy Market. So if you are looking for an affordable, clean, sizeable, close to local transportation Hotel in Boston, this is for you!
