<Content>Excellent Location Excellent location as mentioned in other reviews. Easy walking distance to The Rocks area, Sydney Bridge, the Opera House, and Darling Bay. No more than 15 minutes in any direction. Room was not huge but clean and comfortable. Internet is available in the front reception. Three screens available 20 mins for $2. Pick-up for trips was not from the front of the hotel but across the street at Menzies. Be careful using the $12 pp shuttle to the airport. We booked it in advance but we were'missed' off the collection and the desk advised us that this had happened to several other people. So it's worth making the desk check on your departure date. After a small altercation with the desk staff and then duty manager we were eventually sent to the airport in a taxi at no additional charge. Overall met our needs perfectly.

<Content>VFM This hotel is in a great location, 10-15 minutes from the Rocks 5 minutes from George St and 15 minutes from the Ferries. Large, clean room with great shower and comfy bed. It looks like it has been recently refurbished and a great bonus is that you can open the windows when the A/C has got too much. Although a really busy hotel the service at reception was very good and there is a laundromat on the top floor. We did'nt eat breakfast here as there were so many places nearby to eat. For central Sydney there is no reason to pay more for a room you are only going to use to sleep in.

<Content>Content With Stay Stayed here for 5 nights. You are close to everything, as the other posts mention. The hotel is on a major street- with 30 buses passing by at all times of the day and night, along with sirens- so the higher up you are, the better.The gym was near the top of the hotel, along with the laundry, and both were decent. The rooms were clean and roomy. No complaints.

<Content>Good hotel - noisy lift Great location - very near to the Wynyard train station from which you can get straight to the airport in under 30 mins.Good location for exploring the city too. 15 mins walk to the bridge/opera house and 15 mins in the other direction to the lovely Darling Habour.Our first room was on the top floor and was huge! However, the lift was pretty noisy and we requested a swap. Got moved to a smaller room and didn't get any price reduction, which was slightly annoying. However, we were happy enough with their response to our complaint so didn't bother even asking.Staff were friendly enough, but it's the location and reasonable price which makes me recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good value, great location We stayed here for 5 nights in October as a base for exploring Sydney and the surrounding area.Coming from the airport, you can catch a train direct to Wynyard station and the hotel is just 100yds away, so very easy to reach.We found the staff to be friendly and efficient and the rooms were clean and spacious. The best thing about the hotel though is the location, you are centrally located, no more than a 5 - 10min walk from all the main sights and attractions, absolutely perfect for tourists.Meals at the hotel seemed a bit expensive, but there were loads of other restaurants, cafe's, bars nearby so this didn't really matter.

<Content>good value simple accommodation in central Sydney This is a basic, functional hotel in the city centre, well located for transportation and most business addresses. It's clean, well maintained, respectable, and has a very decent restaurant attached. There are no ancillary facilities that I'm aware of. The rooms are simple but with a kettle to make tea/coffee, and (expensive but quite good) internet connection. It's on a busy street but the window insulation seems to be fairly effective in keeping out the noise.It's good value for money - I've stayed in many different city centre hotels in Sydney in this price bracket, and this is one of the better ones.Part of the cost efficiency clearly comes from having a small staff headcount, so be prepared for delays if you're unlucky with the timing of your check in or check out.

<Content>Good location The hotel is in a good location - not far from Circular Quay, Opera House, Bridge and Darling Harbour. Shops are also close by. Room has everything you need - we paid a special rate due to construction, so we were pleased with what we paid for ($105 for the night). I'm not sure I'd pay the full price though. Rooms were clean with 2 large beds (maybe a bit smaller than a double bed per person).Car parking is a bit of a nightmare and is limited. The sign is small and entrance is round the corner from the hotel - once you've mastered the one way system (tip - if you are coming across Harbour Bridge, stay in a left hand lane).Costs $20 a night.Food and internet looked pricey - there are much cheaper options near by. Reception staff were fine and answered any questions.

<Content>Great Location! My husband and I were very pleasantly surprised by the Travelodge Wynyard. This hotel has a great location and is close to so many attractions and sights within Sydney. We were able to easily walk to the Sydney Opera House, the Rocks, Darling Harbour, the Sydney Aquarium, and many other things. There are also plenty of restaurants nearby. The room itself is not fancy but very adequate. We found the staff to be friendly as well. We did not try to restaurant downstairs because the breakfast and dinner prices seemed on the higher side, but they apparently have an affordable lunch package. The cost of wireless internet connection within the rooms was pricey in my opinion - however, they do have coin operated internet terminals downstairs for quick use. Overall, we were not disappointed and would stay here again.

<Content>Most impresssed... The receptionist was very polite and greeted us with good afternoon, Mr  Mrs... Although the room smelt faintly of cigarette smoke, especially when in bed, the excellent breakfast well made up for it. We were seated right by the window so great for people watching - the city was buzzing with commuters on their way to work. An ideal hotel to explore everything by foot,. We had an interesting walk to the ferries. Amazing views at night of everyone going home across the bridge and of the pretty lights down below in the CBD. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great unless you need to park a car I stayed at this property hoping to get a reasonable nights accommodation in an inner city hotel. The room was comfortable and the price was ok but parking the car proved to be a dilema. When i booked the accommodation i was told the hotel had parking (which it did) but i wasnt told it had LIMITED parking. Infact it had very limited parking and we ended up having to park in a nearby parking station overnight for a ridiculous cost of $72 for a 12 hour period and then wheel all of our luggage through the traffic,in the rain, to the hotel.I was NOT impressed and would not use this hotel in the future.

<Content>staff need customer service training We have just returned from a trip round the east coast of Australia, punctuated by a stopover at Hong Kong and ending in Bangkok, and this was the poorest of all the hotels we stayed in. The staff were not customer friendly so we had to find our own way around, the lady receptionist was always on the phone and the men, on the whole, uninterested. One early start I asked whether we turned left or right out of the hotel for a particular road (that turned out to be just across the road) and the man said 'you have to turn right, it's a one way street', when I said we were walking he just shrugged his shoulders instead of saying that it was only across the road!

Wynyard rail station immediately next door and it is very handy to get to and from the airport from this station.Nice staff and food overall a lovely experience. BTW no point in getting an executive room just a little bigger but no real view to speak of on the higher floors.

<Content>Bloody Awful - not worth the stress! What a nightmare.Noisy rooms; the walls seem to be made of paper - you can literally hear EVERYTHING in the adjacent rooms and down the corridors; The staff are unfriendly, unhelpful and have MEGA attitude; and in general, Travelodge is a complete rip off for what you get; We stayed our last couple of nights in the Amora for EXACTLY the same price - the Amora is pure, 5*, luxury... :)On arrival at Travelodge, the front desk 'took a copy' of our credit card incase we incurred additional expenses - fine, this is a standard procedure. What they didn't tell us, is they actually withdrew $500 from our account. Front desk said numerous times they'd sorted it out, and then after 5 days when the money still wasn't back in our account, they told us to go to our bank and sort it out ourselves.... Oh-kaaaaay.... Hello? We're on holiday? Our bank is in another country.... Anyway - your own bank can't refund money that someone else has taken?!!? They didn't refund the money until a week AFTER we'd arrived home, and Westpac in Sydney (we went in there to ask for advice as Travelodge wouldn't offer any!) told us they've had this happen numerous times - Travelodge say they're taking an imprint of your card, but actually hold back the funds from your account, and then refuse to tell their own bank to refund it - you have to wait 10 working days for it to be automatically go back into your account.Just don't do it - it's not worth the price, stress or hassle!

<Content>Location, Location, Location Had a week here at the end of July 2008. After much discussion we decided to go for a cheaper hotel in Sydney on the principal we would be out and about all the time.The Wynyard Travelodge fits that description perfectly. Very clean and close to all the major central sights and communications to the outer parts of Sydney you may wish to visit. Only 100m from the Station so the transfer from the Airport was very easy.Short walk to Circular Quay, The Rocks and Opera House. In the other direction only a stroll to the city and Darling Harbour.Only down side was we tried the breakfast one morning and it was average at best and not particulary cheap. Better to go out and grap a late breakfast elsewhere.

<Content>Great Location; Great Service: I Would Return!!! I recently spent at week beginning August 2 at the Travelodge Wynyard. I was very impressed with their communications prior to my visit. My emails and questions were responded to within 24 hours and in a very customer friendly manner.My flight arrived at 6:30am and I was aware that official check in time would not be until 2pm which is typical of most hotels at which I've stayed. They did tell me that they expected the room to be ready by Noon if I wanted to check by with them at that time. They gave me a map and gave me a good orientation to things to see nearby and stored my luggage.I spent that morning looking around and then going to the Sydney Aquarium. and Wildlife Park...a must experience. The time passed quickly and I actually didn't get back to the hotel until almost 2 pm. If you buy a combined ticket to the Aquarium and Wildlife attractions, you get a discount and unlimited visits for 30 days.I did eat the full breakfast on my last day as it would be a very long 24 hours back home. It was excellent with a great selection. Whenever I went out in the morning for my activities, I glanced into the restaurant and found it very busy. I did eat two evening meals in it and they were quite good and reasonable with attentive table service.For those wanting just a light breakfast, Starbucks is just down the street on the corner. McDonalds is located on the next street over with more of a walk than to Starbucks. There is a Japanese restaurant next door and small cafes and delis within easy walking distance.I chose this hotel because I planned to be active and would just need a comfortable room to sleep and did not want to pay sky high exotic destination prices. My room was very clean and it was quiet. I have problems sleeping at times so any small noises can bother me. I heard very little during sleeping hours.The location is excellent as it is within walking distance of Darling Harbour, the Rocks, etc. It is also close to a train station. There is also the monorail, Explorer Bus and the Hop On, Hop Off bus for easy exploration when you get tired of walking. I even took a day tour to Canberra, the Australian captiol, which gave another insight into Australia and a contrast to Sydney but a wonderful city in its own right with its spectacular architecture, buildings, and national embassies.The staff was very good at alerting me to any messages left with activity companies, and they were very friendly. Some spent time in down moments discussing the local area as well as the states.Bottom line is that I have stayed in 4 star hotels with far less effective service and which were noisy. I absolutely was satisfied with my reception, my stay, accomodations, and assistance while there. If I return, I will definitely return to the Travelodge Wynyard. It made my vacation a wonderful experience at a reasonable price.

<Content>Other reviews say it all Great location, decent rooms, clean, comfy. Location location location. 10 mins to Rocks, Circular Quay, 5mins to shopping, Wynyard bus/train station immediately next door, 15mins to Darling Harbour. I cannot add to what others have said.Two slight niggles - the right most lift of the three is troublesome! And the lobby smells of the fried foods from the kitchen. We had breakfast once but there are better and cheaper alternatives within 5 minutes.

<Content>Convenience - so near to the train station Stayed there for 4 nites n its very convenient as it is just 100 meters or less to the nearest train station n there are eateries at the station n ard it. We got the 7-days pass for train/bus/ferry which even includes the route to Blue Mountains.Room was clean n tidy whenever we requested it. Only complaint was the receptionist at the counter when we checked in. The lady at the desk at that time wasn't friendly and don't carry a smile when we asked for directions to a place.But the ones who was on the duty at nite were really good. We asked for recommendations on the local clubs. She gave us more than enough choices n directions to get there too.The hotel let us kept our luggages for free after we checked out as our flight was at late evening.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Getting There: While a taxi is the quickest means to get to the hotel, I would strongly recommend (especially for those traveling solo) taking instead the subway, which will be about one-quarter of the cost of a taxi (including return). The subway stops at both the international and domestic terminals of the airport. Take it to the Wynyard Station and exit on York Street. Look to your left; the hotel is on the very next block, about 100 meters away. (It took me, from the time my plane landed in Sydney to the time I arrived at the hotel, exactly one hour; that included the time during which I had to wait to get my bags as the carousel.)Rooms: My room was fairly large. The bed was comfortable, and there was a fair amount of storage space. I had a refrigerator but no microwave. The staff at the Travelodge is very courteous and more than willing to answer questions and provide assistance to patrons.Fun: The Travelodge is in the heart of Sydney. It is about a 10-minute walk from Circular Quay and Sydney Tower, and 20-25 minutes from the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Circular Quay where the Sydney Opera House is located; it is also where one can catch the harbor ferries. Food: There is a restaurant at the hotel. Breakfast runs $20 (Australian) for the continental buffet and $25 for the hot buffet. Dinner will cost about $17-25 per entr茅e. If you are on a tight budget or want to eat away from the hotel, there are numerous restaurants and bakeries nearby. I found several bakeries at Wynyard Station, and there is even a grocery store there. One can go through the station into one of the downtown shopping markets. For those looking for a quick cup of coffee or snack, Starbuck鈥檚 is located across the street from the hotel. (Head toward Wynyard Station on York Street; you can鈥檛 miss it.) Fitness: Sydney is an easy city to walk around. If you are looking for a gym, the hotel does have a fitness center, located on the 21st (top) floor. It has an elliptical machine, treadmill, bike, rowing machine, and dumbbells up to 10 kg. Internet: While there is internet access in the room, it is pricey. On the lobby floor are three computers that offer internet at the cost of $1 for 20 minutes time. One can also print material off at 20 cents a page.

Definitely stay again.

<Content>Great location Even though I had emailed the hotel several weeks in advance to request an early check in, unfortunately when we arrived, tired and jet lagged at 8am on a Sunday morning, we were told that we wouldn't be able to check in til 2pm.Luckily we were able to leave our luggage there so off we went to kill some time by going to the cinema. Everything is within walking distance from the hotel so its location is ideal. For longer trips, the train station is just a few doors down.Our room was right next to the lifts which were quite noisy - at night time especially. Breakfast is served on the ground floor and the choice was good. There's 3 coin-operated internet points in the lobby too.Any time we walked through the lobby it always seemed to be thronged with people so we had very little interaction with the reception staff.All in all, even though the location was good, if I was to return to Sydney, I think I'd investigate other hotels. Our travel agent had another hotel for a similar price in the heart of The Rocks [an area that's well worth a visit] so I think next time we'd stay there.

<Content>great hotel The travel lodge is in a perfect location. We arrived at Sydney airport and took the airport link train to Wynyard station which cost around 拢6.50. From here you just turn left and the hotel is just after Starbucks. We could walk very easily to Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay, The Rocks and Darling Harbour (5 mins stroll). We booked the hotel based on its location, which is perfect. We also got a clean, pleasant and larger room than I expected. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Clean base in great location This is a good Travelodge. Room  bathroom as you'd expect, but clean. Great location for visiting Sydney.Good aspects of our stay:- location. Easy enough to walk to Circular Quay / Opera House/ Bridge etc. and also Sydney Tower  Darling Harbour. - we arrived early after an overnight flight. Staff recognised this and kindly gave us a room immediately. Much appreciated. Would have been better to have been on a floor where there was no work going on though.- staff helpful and efficient.Not quite so good:- room on floor without work going on - especially when kindly given room to sleep during the day to recover from jet lag.- had to correct room rate, as tried to charge for additional person in the room (son aged 11), when nothing mentioned on original booking for 2 adults  1 child. However, they did correct without too much discussion.- raves about the room rates. I'm not sure I'd say it was a great price on it's own. However, I couldn't get anything else that looked as safe a bet at a better price.Recommendations:- get airport shuttle from the airport. We got a taxi and wished we'd got the shuttle. Traffic, although after rush hour, was heavy  guy used toll roads.- get taxi back to airport, particularly if early flight. We used shuttle after the taxi experience and decided we'd just got them the wrong way round! Shuttle went to various different pick-ups and the last couple of pick ups everyone on the bus thought it was full already! Especially the luggage. Also, not all the seatbelts worked!- really enjoyed Opera House tour, Pylon Lookout, Powerhouse Museum, eating at Darling Harbour  Circular Quay, hop on / off bus tour, walking through Botanical Gardens.

Reception staff were quick, friendly  efficient. Room was clean  adequate, views were of buildings but I didn't book this hotel for views. Location was brilliant, walking distance to the Rocks, Circular Quay, the harbour etc couldn't fault it. Would recommend this for travellers who want a clean, well located hotel for a reasonable pricewould certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great location, OK stay Spent one night (6 May)at the hotel. Renovations still going but weren't a problem for us. Our room was on the 17th floor facing busy York Street and we found it quite noisy with the traffic. Had a very small glimpse of the harbour, too! The room itself was compact but clean..the bathroom being even more compact! The bed was very firm, which we dint mind but could be problematic for others.There were 3 lifts which were quite slow at times and small...in fact the whole hotel gave the impression of limited space. Our rates included buffet brekkie, with a large selection of fruits, cereals, cold meat ,cheese, eggs, bacon etc...... OK but not outstanding.Staff were helpful.All in all, was an OK stay for the cheaper rates we got ...location excellent...short walk to Circular Quay and diagonally across the road from Wynyard Station and train to the airport!

<Content>Location only redeeming quality My wife and I spent 4 days here while exploring Sydney. We were very happy with the location (both harbours, bridge climb, shopping etc were easily accessible) but like other reviewers we had some reservations about the hotel facilities.Although staff tried to be very helpful, there were often just too few of them trying to service too many guests. The hotel was in the middle of a refurbishment so the lifts were often locked off by the builders causing massive delays and the place was dusty and covered with scaffolding downstairs.The room was fine but very tired.If ever they finish the makeover (and don't hike up the prices as a result) it could be a great value place to stay. Meanwhile - get a refurbised room on a high floor and enjoy the walks.

<Content>Noisy, Stinky, Grotty, Service Fine The first room I was booked into stunk of smoke, even though it's meant to be a non-smoking hotel. The second room I walked into had so much chemical air scent sprayed in it - that my throat became hoarse  I could barely speak. I sounded like I had a heavy cold for three hours afterwards  had to leave the hotel. I have never had a reaction like that before.The beds had creases in them  even on a Sunday it was noisy from the traffic below. The walls and carpets were marked. I was very sorry to have wasted my time on this hotel.My complaints were dealt with fairly effectively, though it still cost me time, cab fares and third party booking fees. The other thing that concerned me was - what on earth is in the air? Save yourself the heartache  go for something better to begin with.

<Content>Good location - shabby hotel When booking this hotel we specifically asked about parking as we would be arriving by car. When we arrived, the underground carpark was full and we had to park in a public car park. When we did manage to get into the hotel carpark we were charged 拢20 per day - and had to park a hire car between two builders trucks - great if your car carries a hefty excess for damage!!The hotel room was adequate but shabby. The room had been much bigger in a former life and a thin dividing wall had been constructed. It meant that we heard everything our neighbours did for the 4 days we were there.The front desk was impersonal and had a couldn't care less attitude. One desk clerk charged to cash travellers cheques whilst on another day another didn't. The facilities were poor. One washing machine for the entire hotel - the dryer didn't work. The resturant was ok. Since the hotel was in the middle of a massive upgrade all the lifts were used by builders etc and it took 20 minutes to get to our hotel floor.I spent my younger days back packing and this hotel would have been brilliant in that category but no more than that. I stayed in 10 hotels in Australia on my recent trip and this was by far the worst.The only reedeming feature was the location - couldn't fault it. If it smartens itself up and employs staff who care - this hotel could make a fortune....

<Content>Great location For our second visit to this great city we wanted a VFM hotel nearer to Circular Quay  Darling Harbour than last time when we were based in Kings Cross. We chose the location well. 5 mins walk from the speedy airport rail link and an easy stroll to the waterfront. Room was a pefectly adequate base for the 6 nights we stayed there, and we would be happy to return.

<Content>Great Staff Great Location In January and February 2008 month my wife andmyself had the pleasure at staying here while we planned and returned from our New Zealand Cruise, the roomwas very clean and newly appointed; more then adequate for our needs. The Staff at the front desk on several occasions went beyond the call of duty to assist and meet our needs beyond our expectations ---single beds became a king bed in less then an hour, bags where stored with interest and assistance in our departure, assistance was given with internet problems that the kiosk could not attend to, taxi's were hailed from the curbside in amongst the construction and noise....a great staff team..all the right people in the right jobs..ensured great service...

<Content>Great stay - worth every $ I stayed at the Wynard travelodge when travelling on business and if you can't afford the Four Seasons but want to stay near the harbour for a reasonable cost this is the place for you.I stayed up on the 21st floor at the front of the hotel - with a view of the park and the York st buildings. Decent sized room - big for Travelodge - and COMPLETELY refurbished - everything in this room is brand spanking new - shiny tiles, shiny sheets and towels even a shiny new soap holder. A large rainforest showerhead, pretty standard/ usual toiletries, brand new flat LCD tv, broadband internet connection, ironing board, mini bar, HEAPS of storage, block out blinds - GREAT firm pillows. The only thing was that there was a vending machine outside my room door and things in there were half the price or less of the mini bar prices. Room service - pretty standard but OK. The gym room was empty of all equipment - but the TV was operating - so I suppose you could it on the floor and watch the 24hours of continuous TV in a big empty room.Being up high I had very little street noise and despite being practically on top of Wynyard Railway there was no train noise. Taxis and buses literally at the door. Service can be a bit hard to get - it's nice but at checkout in the morning there was only 1 woman and a long queueWhat can I say - great price, great location, great stay

<Content>Great location, good priced hotel We picked this hotel because we could easily get a train from the airport to Wynyard and also it was close to the cruise terminal where we would be departing from on the following day. I had also stayed several times in this hotel when it was known as the Corus. Even though the Corus was ok, it is nice to see it being renovated.We had a nice size renovated room, no problems. On Check in they did not have our booking and I think they tried to sort it out with the agent over the phoe, after about 15 mins we were in our room. Although our booking was room only, when i enquired about the cost of breakfast next morning, the desk advised it was included in our room charge, so that was a bonus. Breakkie was nice.All in all, I'm glad we chose this hotel.

<Content>Travel Lodge Wynyard - Location is great. Good standard hotel in a great location. Short walk to Circular Quay. (Tip: Buy a 3 day travel pass that allows you access to tourist bus, ferry cruises and train.)The Travel lodge is located next to Wynyard train station which makes it very easy to get to and from the airport. In reply to a previous post that said they could not find food. There is a 24 hour deli just round the corner so you can by food drinks at any time. Also lots of restaurants etc near by.Is located in the business district. A starbucks next door (very tempting). Also a few trendy bars catering for the office crowd nearby/Rooms, clean, comfortabe with tea and coffee facilities.Booked hotel on wotif.com and got a good price

<Content>Great location - rooms OK As other reviewers have rightly stated, the best aspect of this hotel is it's location. Great for getting to all the tourist spots.Whilst we were at the hotel upgrade works were taking place to both the inside and outside of the building, whilst these did not disturb us it did leave the hotel looking messy (both outside and along the landings were rooms were being worked on).The rooms were comfortable and we were lucky enough to get into one of the refurbished rooms. Not a massive difference between the refurbished rooms. The view from our room was straight into the office block behind the hotel, but we didn't mind as we didn't spend much time in there.My only complaint would be the fact that the front desk staff booked us a taxi to take us back to the airport that never turned up and we ended up flagging one off the street (eventually!).

<Content>Great hotel for sightseeing For a Travelodge this is fantastic value for money, it's right at the heart of the city near all the great locations like Circular Quay, Darling Harbour, The Rocks, Shopping. We got a great deal with an extra night free. Rooms come with a safe which is always good  the hotel offer left luggage if you have a late flight. There was some construction work going on, but it didn't cause any bother, also the views aren't great unless you go above the 16 floor. But how much time will you spend in the room?

<Content>Great option right in town We chose this place because of a major reduction in cost due to construction. Our view was blocked but it was very quiet. It was clean and a great location. It was an amazing deal. If it was more expensive, I would suggest staying in the Rocks area- it's much more closer to restaurants and still close to the sites.

<Content>Fantastic location and service My wife and I stayed here on a Saturday evening due to having a work Christmas party. We ended up getting the room for $183AUD including overnight parking (unlimited entries) and for this price in Sydney we weren't expecting much. We were pleasantly surprised at the room as we had stayed in much worse for a dearer price. The room was very clean (and looked new I might add), bathroom was adequate as well.The room has everything you need - a safe, TV with a couple of foxtel channels, iron, tea/coffee and in-room internet (but really pricey at AUD$22 for 24hours - an internet cafe is the best bet) and of course a bed. Even the wardrobe seemed to be larger than other places we have stayed at. Some people have complained about the size of the bathroom, but it was big enough to do the job! Unfortunatey we didn't spend too much time in the bathroom so it didn't worry us one bit. In regard to the view, there was none!! We were looking directly at the building opposite and we could see the street down below (pretty uneventful really), but for the price we paid we weren't complaining.We did have a couple of dilemma's with the room and they were:*The toilet half flush button was not working at all, meaning we had to use the full flush all the time.*We noticed what looked to be mould above the shower on the ceiling (hard to describe but the ceiling in our shower was not flat)*I had a hole in my bath towel*no fly screen on the opening windowWe did mention these on the checkout questionaire so hopefully these will get resolved.I must thank the night person who brought up the first aid kit at 1230am. I managed to get scratched pretty bad and they came up straight away and patched me up!

<Content>great location Arrived 21-00 Sunday hungry! Reception were unable to direct us to a food outlet even Circular Quay seemed to be closed. Eventually made it to Macdonalds just before they shut. We were surprised by this in a big city. There were vending machines in the hotel for chocolate bars crisps etc.  It all seemed a bit grubby but looked better in the sunshine next day.This is a basic hotel, in a good central location. Reasonably priced place to lay your head while you enjoy sightseeing.

<Content>Great Location, great value We have stayed in this hotel the last three times we have visited Sydney. The hotel is excellent value for it's location. This time it had also benefited from a refurbishment of the rooms.The location is excellent. Right in the centre of the city. About 10 minutes from the Rocks and the Harbour. Also about 10-15 minutes from Darling Harbour. Next to Wynyard station if you want to travel further. The rooms are clean and are a bit better than a travelodge in the UK. Tea and Coffee making facilities in every room. Staff are freindly and helpful. Can not comment on the breakfast as we had breakies at a nearby MacDonalds! English muffins with vegimite very nice.I love Sydney must go back again soon.

<Content>Ok We stayed here for 7 days on our Sydney leg of our honeymoon. It was ok for the price, but unfortunately we were there when they were having renovation work done. It wouldn't have been so bad but we firstly didn't kow anything about it - was not notified by travel agent or the hotel when we booked in. The builders were not suppose to start until 9am but there was always banging and drilling at 7am. We complained to the Manager who apologised and did nothing ! I even went as far as writing a letter, but still never heard anything back. Despite this the hotel is very near the Rocks and Darling Harbour which you can walk to easily and Wynard Street Station is only across the road.Don't have breakfast here ! It is so expensive !

<Content>Excellent Hotel Just returned from months tour of Australia (on our Honeymoon). We stayed at the Travelodge Wynyard for 8 nights.Really is a 'value for money' hotel.The location is so perfect ,being 10 minutes from Darling Harbour, 15 from The Rocks and 10 minutes from Chinatown. As its practically next door to Wynyard Station. Which you can use from the Airport and Back. If you buy a sydney travel pass this train fare is included. The pass doesn't start until you use it within sydney town centre (so think about how many days you require)Hotel is off the same standard as our Travel Inns - so you know what to expect.There is a Coles Suppermarket located in Wynyard station for all your conveniences. If you need any advice whilst in sydney, then a visit to the sydney visitor centre in the rocks will sort you out.Have fun

<Content>My Favourit Sydney Hotel You can't beat the price for what the Travelodge offers. Most of the rooms have been recently renovated and are clean, bright and tidy. Its within walking distance of the main shopping areas of Sydney, and the Opera House, the historic Rocks district, which is an entertainment area as well as being a tourist and historical drawcard. Wynyard Railway station is just across the street with connections all over the city, the buses are close and its a short walk to the ferrys at Circular Quay. Service was excellent, receptionist and roomstaff were friendly, cheerful and courteous. Even on APEC weekend when the city was locked down the Travelodge was an oasis of calm, friendly, efficient service. I'll be back.

<Content>Love the Location We stayed here for 5 nights and the location, as everyone has said is fantastic. You couldn't ask for a more centally located hotel. Plenty of pubs around, only a short walk to Darling Harbour and Sydney Harbour. Wynyard Station is right down the road so getting the airport train is pretty much right to the door. The rooms were average but in good condition. We stayed on the 7th floor and heard traffic noise. The housekeeping was also on the same floor so there was constant door opening etc. Overall the experience was good and would recommend to most travellers.

Room service was good too.The only grip we had was the size of the bathroom/toilet. It was far too small. You were basically peeing right next too some clean towels. My partner said that she wouldn't stay here again because it was too small.The breakfast was very expensive at $22 for buffet and $17 for continental. There aren't many local places to eat for breakfast unless you walked to Circular Quay.

There are two computers in the reception area - which permanantly have people on them. We used an internet cafe instead.Rooms are clean and basic. They left a bottle of fizz for us, and also left a wedding card and some fizz from friends of ours who left it in the hotel's care the month previously.The location is great - easy to walk to Darling Harbour and the bridge.

<Content>Great Value and Location We stayed at the travel lodge for 3 nights on our honeymoon, and then treated ourselves to the last 3 nights at the Shangri-la hotel. The travel lodge is a great hotel, we had a newly refurbished room which was very comfortable. The staff were really friendly and very helpful on providing restaurant recommendations. The location is just fantastic, close to the harbour with all of the attractions and a few minutes walk from the Rocks. We only found out that the Shangri-la and Travel lodge were on the very same road when we were in Sydney and had we have known, we would have stayed at the travel lodge and saved our money and spent it on something else during our honeymoon.Would definitley stay here again.

<Content>Good Value We had stayed here before when it was the Corus Hotel and had always found it convenient and inexpensive if a little dowdy. This time with the refurbishment it was very pleasent and still very reasonable. The room at the back is smallish but quite adequate ,is light and still has a bit of an outlook . The furniture is comfortable, functional and has what is needed. The value for money at Travelodge became evident when we had to move hotels and found the next one in the same location to be more expensive with a large opulent lobby but a dark room looking on to a light well, furniture which was not useful eg the bedside table on one side of a double bed only. We will cheerfully return to the Travelodge Wynyard .

<Content>Great base from which to explore the best attractions around Sydney Travelodge Wynyard was a great base from which to explore Sydney. It is in an excellent location鈥?only a few blocks from the breathtaking Sydney Harbor Bridge, Opera House, and The Rocks area. As of Oct 2006, the hotel was undergoing renovations and the room I was originally given was one that had not been renovated and was sub-standard. However, when I called the reception desk to complain I was quickly assigned to a room that had been renovated and it made all the difference in the world. Be sure to request a renovated room---they are SO much nicer! The d茅cor is very contemporary and the room was clean and spacious! Continental breakfast was not included in my room rate and for the charge of around $16 you can do better by going out to a caf茅 or alternatively, grabbing a quick bite at Starbucks across the street. Overall, the hotel was 鈥渘o frills鈥?(as expected for the reasonable room rate), but the room was comfortable and you can鈥檛 beat the location! And during your stay, take the time to have a leisurely lunch or dinner around the Sydney Harbor.....

The Bridge, Opera House and Darling Harbour are only 5-10minutes walk away.Although the staff were friendly and helpful I was unable to check in any earlier than 2pm which was hard since I had arrived at 6am. The hotel is in the process of refurbishment but we didn't here or see anything. Our room was a little dated but clean. The room was nice but the pillows were a bit flat.This is a good hotel at a good price. I would certainly recommend it for the location and convenience.

<Content>Good location... but do not expect a good night of sleep Agree with the most recent reviews here, which basically state that the location is fabulous, but the hotel is not great. Our executive room was rather shabby (old carpet, old linen, bathroom falling apart), but the renovation should take care of that. The problem was that the walls are so thin that we could hear the next door neighbours using their electric toothbrush - it was like being in a hostel!!! In the last two nights, we had to move rooms because the new guests in the next room were rowdy and we could not sleep.The gym is also rather naff, by the way!

The hotel is in a great location just a short walk to the bridge and opera house. If you just want a clean bed to sleep in while you look around Sydney then this is for you it's not glam but for the price it's worth it.

<Content>Good location...thats about it Just returned from a 3 week round-the-world honeymoon, stayed at the Wynyard hotel while in Sydney. We arrived on a flight from Bangkok arriving in Sydney at 6.30am. We came straight from the airport to the hotel and asked about possibly getting a room immediately. We were unable to get it, and told we would have to wait until 2pm, maybe 1pm if we were lucky, the staff just seemed uninterested and unhelpful which is what you dont need after a long flight when you are tired.(We were not the only couple who had arrived on an early flight)So we made the most of a bad situation, we were able to use their washrooms to get changed, and so we started our Sydney sight-seeting immediately. Returned to hotel at 1pm and room was still not ready. Eventually got the room at 2.15pm. We did get a suite on the top floor which was spacious and clean. The hotel is very central. We climbed the Harbour Bridge the following day. Well worth it. Also went to the Blue Mountains and Hunter Valley. Also well worth doing.The hotel does have a self service laundry service which was handy.I would not recommend this hotel based on what I saw of other floors.

<Content>Basic, but clean and in a brilliant location Booked this with trailfindersIf you are looking for somewhere cheap and central this is the place. It is near the Bridge, Circular Quay, Opera House, Shopping, Nightlife and Wynard Train station.We took a cab from the airport (mistake as it cost us $30) on way back we used walked 200 yards to the Train station and got train to the airport. While in Sydney we purchased the Sydney pass $110 dollars, but great value. we got a day harbour cruise, night harbour cruise, the Sydney explorer bus, bondi explorer bus, all other bus and rail transport including out to airport. 拢40 sterling, it worked out very good value for a tourist type trip to Sydney.The Travelodge was very basic, breakfast was available but not included in the price, but we availed of the local food courts which were terrific value.We had a problem with the shower, it was either boiling or freezing and report it to the desk, but they didn鈥檛 appear to sort it out. Requested extra towels, but they never came.However, all that aside when you are in Sydney for a holiday, you basically use a place like the Travelodge to sleep in. The fact that it was central was a more important factor.Would stay here again, but would ensure that the shower was working first ;-)

<Content>Ok, but only in a Studio room We stayed here for 4 nights in May. The first two rooms we were offered were pretty horrible. One had a very suspicious stain on the bed sheet and there was a really loud buzzing noise coming from the floor above and the other was a former inter-connecting room and as a result was very noisy, you could hear every word from the people next door!We were finally offered a studio as no other rooms were available and this was much nicer. A good size room with a kitchen. However, the TV didn鈥檛 work, but someone fixed this the next day.The front desk were nice enough and helped us out whenever we asked.The best thing about this hotel is its location, a short walk to darling harbour, not far from Circular Key and good shopping close by. All in all I would stay here again as it is good value for money, but only to stay in a studio not a standard room.

<Content>Great location Stayed for a week in this hotel and after visiting a Travelodge in Melbourne for a few days came back for a further week. The Hotel staff are really nice and couldn't be more helpful. Breakfast is a bit expensive but there is plenty of it. The Hotel is apparently undergoing some renovation at the moment and some of the rooms could do with it. Having said that although the carpet in our room was a bit shabby the room was clean and the bed linen all seemed new. The second time we stayed we had a room with a balcony which was a bit more expensive but seemed to have been one of the upgraded ones and was really nice. The situation of the hotel was perfect. Five minute walk to Darling Harbour and ten minutes to Circular Quay. For us it couldn't have been better. The Hotel also has a bar and the restaurant does evening meals which we also sampled and could recommend.The price is reasonable and you get good value for money. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent location Excellent location. The hotel is in the central business district, so a bit quieter at night than other areas, but that has its benefits. Very easy to walk to Darling Harbour which is briliant for a meal/drinks in the evening - all restaurants around a harbourwhich is lovely when all lit up). Breakfast is a bit pricey, but other places fairly close by to walk to. Nice walk to Sydney Opera house - maybe 15 mins - in the morning you walk down the same roads as all those people going to work in their suits. The hotel is being upgraded at the moment, so if you get a poor quality room do make a fuss to get upgraded. Room was 拢60 a night, so good price for such a central location. There are a few travelodges with similiar sounding names so make sure you give your cab driver the address too. Internet access available for a fee in Reception and lots of pamphlets on the surrounding area available in hotel. Small hotel bar, but not much to write home about. Seemed to just be used for people waiting for cabs to airport.Easy to walk to shops, monorail station, Rocks and everything Sydney has to offer. Not the most luxurious hotel in Sydney, but remember it is a Travelodge, and you definitely won't be disappointed. Would highly recommend - for good quality, good priced accommodation.

<Content>Good Value, Good Location, Needs Renovation The best thing about this hotel is its excellent location for the price you pay. All the sites, shops and restaurants are only a couple of minutes walk away.The rooms are a bit shabby and the bathrooms the smallest I have ever seen and could do with a facelift. A letter was left on the bed stating that upgrading work was scheduled to start at the hotel shortly after we left, so these issues (not sure how the bathroom size could be addressed) may be resolved.

<Content>The studio rooms here are great We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights as part of an extended holiday. The location is great very close to Darling Harbour, the Rocks and only a short walk to Wynyard station where you can get the rail and buses. It is in the CBD so at night and weekends the area is a bit lifeless, rather reminiscent of the city of London, but it is not far to get to somewhere where there is some nightlifeThe studio rooms are very large and are like a mini suite - it is well worth paying the extra. We had been travelling for two weeks by this point and it was good to have the option to just make and eat something simple rather than always having to go out to a restaurant. There is a supermarket in the station (you access it via the station entrance next to The Menzies Hotel, which is just opposite the Travelodge)The staff were very friendly and helpful. We didn't use the restaurant so can't really comment on that, but there is a Starbucks opposite if you need a caffeine fix!It has a laundry, but no dryer so if you do do washing then you will have to drape things around your room.

<Content>Best Location for all Sydney attractions Just returned from a 7 day holiday to Sydney. Everything was wonderful except for the long, long flight from CA. The hotel is accessible to all attractions. Everything seems only a 5-10 minute walk away; The Rocks, Sydney harbor, Opera House, and lots of shopping. Daily breakfast was good, fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, cereal,juice and good coffee, my son is a breakfast person and he loved it. The room was clean. The bed layout was different. There were 3 of us and we had a room with 3 twin beds, we were assigned a room on the 15th floor and it had a nice view of the city. Yes, there is costruction going on in front of the hotel but we never heard any noise from it, nor did we see people working at the site. Be sure to purchase the tour package for the Opera House, the first tour starts at 9:00 am, it is worth the money to hear about the history and see the inside. This is simple, no thrills, clean hotel located in an excellent location.

<Content>In need of further renovation: but great location This hotel disappointed. We travelled as a family of 5. The 2 rooms allocated were shabby and the air condition was not working. Given the heat, this was not what was wanted. The hotel had a major air con problem that week. A helpful manager upgraded us to decent rooms after some serious negotiation: far superior, actually decorated this century with good beds, more room.....and working air con ! After that bad start, things improved. Good cleanliness. Excellent location. We stayed 5 nights. If we had been allocated the decent rooms initially, I would have had a far better view of the hotel, as it is only 3 star. There were clearly a number of rooms needing an overhaul however.Only tried breakfast once: good but overpriced. Better deals available on several nearby cafes (though some not open at weekends as this street is primarily a business street). Bar OK, but closed early.Very near the Wynyard station, making airport transfers easy.

<Content>Excellent location and great rooms Stayed for a week in Feb 06Loved the hotel and most importantly location Less that 8 min to both Sydney Harbour and Darling Harbour. Direct Access to Airport through Wynyard Station which is 50 meters away.I paid 142 and 130 $ but prices vary widely Check the travelodge and wotif pricesThey gave me a room in the 22nd floor - Elevator goes to 21st and then you have to climb 15 stairs up. But the room had a lounge and a bedroom so felt like a souite. The room had a refrigerator, Stereo/CD player, 2 TV , safety box etcAbsolutely excellent design-Functional and easy The day i was leaving they told me that they were refurbishing the room ! Bonus of 22nd floor is a roof terrace However there is noise from the airconditioning from the hotel and other buildingsOther positivesprices in the restaurant and room service are very good. AUD$10 or 拢4 for main course at lunch time!Starbacks just opposite the hotel and 2 japanese restaurants just next to itEndless food options aroundRooms are connected with BroadbandMy only complain is that Internet is not provided freely. 1 Hour costs $8 on Wifi Having said that i heard people complaining in the reception but no sure whyWill stay here again!

<Content>Overpriced and Shabby We stayed in the travelodge for a couple of days, flying back to England on New years day. We were very disappointed with the hotel. The 'superior' rooms are just higher up, meaning a longer ride in the lift. The staff weren't very helpful, especially in giving information about the city. Prices were extremely high for new years eve, which would be fine if you felt you were getting something for it. We checked out early on new years day and after spending the day on the beach we asked if there were any facilities for us to wash. We were told to use the toilets in the restaurant, which were filthy.Compared to the Radisson in Melbourne and even some of the YHAs in WA, this hotel is really poor.

<Content>Good, but with Reservations I agree with most of the other reviews of the Travelodge Wynyard. The location is outstanding, it's easy to walk to the Rocks (entertainment district), Circular Quay, the Harbor Bridge, the Opera House, Darling Harbor, etc. The room was small but modern and clean, and we got a good rate for a downtown hotel from the hotel rate search engine on the tripadvisor web site.The not so good that we experienced;Not everyone knows about this hotel, as it used to be a Corus hotel, so we had a couple problems initially with cab drivers finding it.The management and staff seemed overwhelmed and not so competent. We arrived around 10 in the evening, we were told the hotel was fully booked so they had to put us up in a sister hotel. We had a 3 night stay, so we had to move back to this hotel after spending the first night in another hotel (they were nice about arranging this and paying for the cabs back and forth, though). I also heard several other issues at the front desk as were coming and going, they seemed to be related to rooms not being ready. The staff blamed this on a new computer system, but who knows.The concierge/bell-man was not very impressive. He was very nice, but didn't have a lot of knowledge about the local attractions and restaurants. There were several groups staying when were there, so it was often difficult to get his attention or assistance as he was constantly checking and un-checking bags for people.All in all, if you can get a good rate I'd consider the Travelodge Wynyard, but if you're not a self-sufficient traveler I'd consider another option.

<Content>Great location and service, poor facilities As the other reviews indicated, cental location is the best reason to stay. We were impressed with the service too, espcially the front desk and bell man. However, the rooms and other areas needed significant restoration, but the conversion to brand name may help. We were initially given a smokers room with a heavy odor, but when we insisted on on nonsmoking room the front desk accomidated us. Breakfast was overpriced, but many other options nearby.

<Content>Great location, very average rooms My husband and I were in Sydney from July 16-22. We stayed at the Travelodge Wynyard as part of a tour. The hotel is in a wonderful location. You can walk everywhere within 5-15 minutes and we did. We walked to Darlington Harbor, Star City, the Rocks, Sydney Opera House, etc. It is a budget hotel and I thought the rooms and the maid service were adequate for the price. The hotel bar was located in the lobby and was average at best. However, there are a number of nice bars nearby on George Street. Our package included breakfast at the hotel daily. After 2 days it wears a little thin. The selection is poor and is the same every day. Luckily, there is a Star Bucks on the next corner. All in all I'd have to say pretty good for the price.

<Content>Look elsewhere if looking for nice hotel at a value price Hotel is full of coach tours, which unfortunately for them they won't know any better.Although we asked for a non-smoking room we were presented with a smoking room, stained and tainted by years of smoke. Bed was uncomfortable, and bathroom tiny. Service was terrible. Unfortunately obtained food poisoning during stay, thought to be from the hotel resturaunt which is suprising given their somewhat limited and overpriced menu.Other Sydney CBD venues such as The Somerset offer much better accomodation and comfier for much the same price. Shop around, and if you can, ask to see a room before you commit, or at least get a Sydney friend to check it out if you can. Comments on this website and photos WERE NOT representative.

<Content>Superb for the money Having never been to Sydney and we'd spent a long time looking for a deal online around the Darling Harbour area with the more common chain names, thinking this was the best place for evening meals and the casino entertainment. I'm so glad we eventually ended up at the Corus because it was a lot cheaper and I suspect the rooms were larger. This place is perfectly positioned for everything. All the main places were literally ten minutes walk away (Rocks, Darling etc).The room we had was facing York Road. There was some building work over the road, but I expect this has finished by now (we were there for four nights back in November 2004). There was a bit of street noise and the windows were single glazed, so If you're a light sleepr try to get a higher floor. Facing York Road meant a view of the tower, nicely lit by night.The room itself was basically furnished. We had a king bed and a sofa as well as a desk, coffee table, couple of chairs and the double wardrobe . We're used to quite small european rooms, and although this wasn't much bigger it was a nice change. It seemed like a suburban sized Holiday Inn (you know.. the one's that are just a little bigger). The bathroom was small, but served its purpose. You won't find anything spectacular in the regular rooms, but it was in spotless order.The staff were always courteous and polite. I couldn't fault them.We had what seems an amazing deal at 拢60 per night with an all you can eat buffet breakfast. There was a vast selection of hot/cold, sweet/savoury foods. Fill up for a long day's sight-seeing.On the whole, if you you want to be safe and comfortable this will do you fine. A bright decent room at a nice hotel just a few yards from the underground station linked to the airport.There's no doubt that when we return to this fabulous city we'll be booking in with the Corus.

It is 10 minutes walking from the Rocks, the harbourfront and many other attractions in Sydney.Overall the hotel, outside and inside, has a kind of run down appearance. The room was OK but the bathroom was kind of obsolete, with very old and loose faucets and it did not look very clean.

Excellent location, only 10 mins walk to the Rocks area where you'll find the Sydney Harbour bridge, Opera House, and all the ferry terminals that take you everywhere really. Very near to train station, that the train from the airport stops. Only $30 to the airport by taxi (if you prefer). Hotel itself excellent. Very clean and great 'in room' facilities, including safe. Very friendly staff, and porters to carry your bags!Breakfast was nice, but a bit expensive, but there are plenty of places to eat or take away in the near vicinity.Very excited, as whilst we were there they started filming the new 'Superman' Film a few meters from our hotel.Great hotel, would definitely recommend it, and would stay there again if in Sydney.

Great location as it was only about 15 min walk to Chinatown, Darling Harbour and other places. The rooms were qquite good, service was excellant and because our room service was going to take a little longer than normal (about 45 mins, not in a hurry anyway) they didnt charge use the room service surcharge. Just a great place to stay, will be staying there again very soon.

<Content>Great Location I stayed here for a week in early December 2004. Best thing about the Corus is its location. Only 50m from Wynyards underground station and only about 20 mins walk to either Darling Harbour, The Rocks or Circular Quay. The shops on George St are less than 5 minutes walk away. My room however, was quite small and pokey with a view right into an office block a few metres away across the street. This other block blocked out most of the natural light although i could see the sky if i pressed my face to the window and craned my neck to look up vertically. I also had to keep my curtains closed (or have the lights off) for privacy. Hotel was offering a special limited summertime menu for $15 which included a glass of house wine and which was very good value. If you want luxury, stay somewhere else but if you want a good location at a reasonable cost, then this could be the place for you.

<Content>Great location, great price Stayed here for 5 nights in October 2004.If overall you are looking for a comfortable centrally located hotel at a decent price then this is a good option. We paid for 4 nights and got 5th free.Booked a superior room but got upgraded to an executive room on arrival, only difference seemed to be mini bar and higher floor so better view.There was building work on over the road (which might have explained the upgrade), but this wasn't too much of a problem as only started after 8am, and not on weekends. Recommend you take ear plugs if you want a lie in though.Staff friendly, we arrived in hire car, they allowed us to use car park to unpack and check in before returning car.Didn't use restaurant/bar as plenty of other options nearby.All in all a good choice, would definately stay there again.

The hotel and its concierge  reception are very busy with tour groups. The rooms are old and small. On the other hand the resturant is excellent and Starbucks is across the street. The small lobby satisfied guests who needed a drink. The clientele are Europeans which for me lends some charm when traveling.

<Content>Good vacation base... Without knowing much about Sydney, I felt like I lucked out in finding a clean, well-run hotel in easy walking distance to all the main tourist attractions at the last minute for a decent price. The staff was very helpful and friendly and I felt safe staying there alone (always a concern as a single traveler). My only complaint would be the construction going on across the street that was a little noisy with the window open, but that won't last forever! Also, on the weekend the surrounding area was somewhat deserted, so extra caution would probably be advised walking around later at night, but I never felt unsafe. All in all, I'd recommend the Corus...
