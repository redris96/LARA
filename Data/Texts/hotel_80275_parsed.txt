<Content>Great place to stay pre-cruise Our family of 7 stayed here the night before our cruise. It was wonderful. The hotel put us all in one large room that overlooked the cruise ship pier. When we got up in the morning we could see our ship! Right across the road was a huge shopping center. When we arrived at the hotel our room wasnt ready they kept our luggage and we went across to the shopping center and had lunch.This hotel was a great location, with awesome customer service.

<Content>Inconvenient. Old and smelled like it -----------------------In Brief-----------------------I likely won't be back unless I have no choice. PARKING - Very little hotel parking, City parking otherwiseLOBBY - Neat, Clean, PleasantCHECK-IN - Friendly, helpfulBAGGAGE - Language issues, maze to get to the carROOM - smelled, stained, door stuck, hard to move inINTERNET - make other plans or wait in line for the business service roomCHECKOUT - Fast, but getting a taxi seemed tough-----------------------The Details-----------------------PARKING I used the Holiday Inn for an overnight stay before a cruise. We drove in from out of town and, while the hotel website advertises $12 parking, they neglected to mention that they had all of 20-30 parking spaces for their 10 story hotel. There are other downtown pay parking lots near by, but it leaves you unloading, hunt for a space somewhere and walking back.... in a downtown environment that had the hotel put up a 8' fence with gates around the lot (if they worry, then I worry).In my case, after finding a lot that I could park in and unloading my car, Someone happened to have left the hotel lot so I was able to snag a space.CHECK-INThe hotel lobby is nicely appointed with what seemed to be a nice bar/dining area (we didn't eat there). Check-in was easy and polite.BAGGAGEAs with most such hotels, getting a luggage cart without a bellman attached proved to be a challenge. He keeps it/them tucked away in a closet behind his desk. After first asking just for a cart, I reconsidered and agreed to have him help with the bags (it was a bit of a maze to get from the parking, around the pool and then zig-zag through the service area of the hotel).Unfortunately, I tried 5 times to tell him I would like him to help us, but I only speak English and wasn't able to get the idea across to him in Miami's native tounge. So we took the cart and hauled it up ourselves. To his credit, the bellman smiled a lot and seemed friendly enough.NO COMISSARYThey don't have any of the usual razor, shampoo, soap, aspirin.... stuff that most hotels have. If you've left a anything at home, you'll need to go out to a drug store (closest was 4 blocks down).THE ROOMThe halls were nice but the room smelled and had significant signs of water damage and peeling wallpaper. The bathroom door had been painted so many times that it couldn't be closed. The entryway to the room is a tight hallway that barely fits you with a suitcase and can't fit the luggage cart, so you have to unload from the hallway and drag things in.THE CHURCHOur room was on the side that was separated from a church by a small road . At 7am, the church loudspeakers started chiming out Christmas music right into our room. That went on for 30 minutes of clanging and gonging. Get a room on another side of the building if you like to sleep in.INTERNET, OR LACK THEREOFI had some things I needed to do just before leaving, and tried to use the their advertised free wireless internet. It wasn't even recognizable in my room at all (5th floor, North side). I called down and they said I should go to the business services room on the second floor. It was packed with all the other people who couldn't get in from their rooms.I went to the lobby, where I'd seen someone using a laptop. I could find the network but it was up and down enough to rival the waves at the beach. After fighting for 20 minutes to connect at all, I couldn't stay connected long enough to do much of anything. I finally went back to the business services room and found a spot. I managed to download the cell-phone dialer software I needed to tie my computer to my cell phone and use IT'S internet connection to connect with my office and get my work done.Don't count on the net there.CHECKOUTThe room was already paid, so it's a leave-the-card-on-the-dresser-and-go checkout, which is nice. We had a car, so we loaded up and were out. There was what seemed to be a taxi-waiting-line in the hotel lobby that extended all the way back to the dining room (30+ people w/bags). I was glad I didn't need a ride.CONCLUSIONIt serves as a need to crash somewhere better than my car, but the next time I'm in Miami for a cruise or any reason other than a stay at a resort on the beach trip, I plan on staying at a (hopefully nicer) outlying hotel and drive the 10-20 minutes into the downtown area if I need to hop the ship.

<Content>Just ok, but decent location Upon arrival the power was out, so the computers and elevators were down. Didn't get to check in until past 4pm, but she did give me free parking, which was normally 20$ a day in their back lot.The hotel is in pretty decent shape. I didn't try the food or the bar because right across the street is Bayside and there are plenty of restaurants and bars there. This is not really a hotel for business as much as it is one for people getting ready for a cruise, as there is a harbor also across the street. Everyone at the hotel was nice and the service was acceptable. Although I would probably pick a different hotel next time, there is nothing significantly wrong with this one. Note that the parking lot behind the building is small and costs money, so if it's crowded you will end up parking on the median on Biscayne, and that's 20$ a day metered.

<Content>Great Pre-Cruise Stay The Holiday Inn Port of Miami was great choice as a pre-cruise hotel. The view I had from my room afforded me the opportunity to observe the cruise ships at the port. I also had a great view of the Bayside Marketplace. The room was very spacious and I had a very comfortable bed. The restroom was very clean and had everything I needed to get ready for my cruise. This hotel is a great value for someone who is either going to the port for a cruise or staying in Miami for a vacation.

<Content>Great views of cruise ship, good breakfast We stayed at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami for one night before taking a cruise on November 13. Check in was a breeze - we got a room on the top floor with a port view. The room itself was more than adequate - comfy bed, lots of room and seating options (a chair and ottoman, a table with 2 chairs and a rolling desk chair). We had dinner across the street at Bayside at Hard Rock Cafe. It was wonderful to be able to cross the street and be somewhere nice. We awoke to the view of our cruise ship docked at the port - adding to the excitement of our trip!We ordered breakfast room service prior to going to bed for the night. We called the restaurant directly - do not use the hang card, there are not many options on there. It was delivered the exact moment we requested it and everything arrived hot and fresh.This hotel met our expectations. No, it's not fancy, but it was great for a short term stay!

<Content>Good hotel before cruise We stayed at this hotel 2 nights before our cruise. We arrived late (after 11pm) and didn't have any problems checking in. Our room was nice with a view of the bay. I thought the beds were comfortable and I didn't have any problems with noise. The hotel is right across the street from Bayside Market Place so there are plenty of places to eat and you can do some shopping. We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast both days, it was a nice meal but I felt it was overpriced. Overall I thought the hotel was nice, clean and in a great location. I would stay here again.

<Content>Couldn't have asked for more! After reading many reviews of this property I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. We arrived at 9:45 am and asked if we could leave our bags there until check in, they gave us a room right away.. The location and view was amazing, right across the street from the Bayside market place and close to the beaches. I loved everythings about it. Thank you Holiday Inn, we loved Miami and your hotel.

<Content>Disappointed with this hotel We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in October '08 prior to our cruise. The lobby area was nice and bright but as soon as we got into the elevators we found there was a terrible musky smell.The rooms were dated and tired looking (I suppose much like ourselves when we arrived, having travelled a long distance from Ireland!)Breakfast in the dining room was very nice and the wait staff were friendly.My biggest gripe about this hotel is that on checking out on the Sunday morning we waited at least 15 minutes for an elevator and even then when we eventually all crowded into one, luggage and all, it kept going up and down to the different floors opening the doors to let people on who couldn't because they were full.Looking back it was quite funny because we kept seeing the same people waiting to get on at each floor and they were wondering why we were still there! Now there is a notice on the elevator stating that they do get quite busy at check out times.We couldn't use the stairs even if we wanted to because this only brings you to an emergency exit. The hotel is obviously aware of the problem given the notice they have posted inside the elevator but yet seem to do nothing about it.You cannot bring your luggage down the night before you check out and get them to store it for you as there is a notice up about this also. Therefore everyone is trying to cram into the elevator, luggage and all, on the morning of departure with two elevators at your disposal. I definitely would not recommend this hotel in view of the total chaos on check out morning.

<Content>Port of Miami Great for Pre Cruise This hotel is in an old building but was clean in lobby and room. Pool is undergoing renovation. You can walk to the Bayside Shopping area which has restaurants/bars and a food court. There are also souvenir type places and shops such as Guess. You cannot walk to the the ship terminal as the bay separates the hotel/shopping area from the port. It was a $12.00 cab ride (two people) from hotel to ship terminal. Breakfast buffet at hotel was typical and cost $12.95. There is Macy's etc. 4 blocks from hotel but we did not check it out. There is a McDonalds within walking distance of hotel. Neighborhood around hotel is seedy.

<Content>pleasantly suprised at holiday inn stayed at the Holiday Inn pre-cruise for two days, based on some of the reviews here I was a little worried, I was pleasantly suprised the Holiday Inn was clean and my room was comfortable. The location is ideal, right across the street is bayside marketplace, they have music , numerous stores and restaurantsit's also a short taxi to the port.Only one issue.. they were re-modeling the pool area during my stay so the pool was closed (kids were disappointed) and parking was a pain because the contractor re-modeling the pool was also using the lot for parking which meant less parking spots for guests.

<Content>Okay, but some problems We booked this hotel almost 1 year in advance. We had stayed here 2 years before and had a great experience. This time was a bit different. The hotel is getting a bit run down. We had requested port view rooms and only gave us two rooms with port view. The other two rooms faced the McDonalds in the back! The carpet is getting worn. The tile in the bathtub was stained. I am usually a big fan of this hotel because of location location location! But I probably won't stay again. The restaurant was around $12 per person for breakfast. So we walked to McDonalds around the corner instead. If you consider this hotel, I wouldn't stay more than one night.The positives: directly across the street from Bayside Marketplace and close to Port of Miami. If you have port view, you can see your ship in the morning. Perfect location for cruisers. Easy to get a taxi in the morning.The negatives: The hotel is getting older. Many people paid less for the much nicer Intercontinental a few doors down. The staff wasn't too friendly or accomodating. There is plenty of noise from the street below and the music at Bayside Marketplace. Housekeeping was lacking. One of our rooms had a couch sofa bed, behind the couch was plaster (or something white and crumbly) from the walls all over the floor. It was disgusting.

<Content>Nice bang for your buck We checked in and were wonderfully surprised with the friendly service. Jennifer was very professional, she answered all of our questions. Our room was on the 8th floor facing the port, great view of our cruise ship. When I booked this hotel I requested a room on a higher floor just for the view. The pool area was small but very comfortable. We used the business center, its on the second floor, it was very clean. I also used the laundry area on the third floor, the in room flyer claims that its $1.50 per load. Its not, it was $1.50 to wash and $1.50 to dry, plus a $1.50 for detergent. The beds were very nice and comfortable. The shower and nice pressure. We couldn't have asked for a better location. We also ate breakfast in the dining room. The breakfast was very good. We would definately stay here again!!

<Content>Great Hotel Near Cruise Port! We stayed at this hotel one night before going on a cruise. I had used our holiday Inn priority point's to book two suites. For an older hotel I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the room's were. We were given corner suites with a great view of the port and the marketplace. The suites had a good size living area with a kitchenette, a huge bedroom with a very comfy bed. The bathroom's were rather small, but had all the amenities a person could need. An in-room safe and a tv in the living area and bedroom. The pool area was rather small, but looked really nice.The only complaint I had was the room service for breakfast. It was not worth the money.Maybe the breakfast buffet was better in the dining room. The great thing about this hotel is the location. All you have to do is walk out the front door, across the street to the marketplace. Lot's to see and do here. We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe. There were several eating establishment's there. Wish we would have ate at one of the local restaurant's though. I think the food and service would have been better. They had local band's playing when it got dark and you could wander through the many vendor's with a nice cold daquiri if you wanted. A fun place to hang out the night before our cruise. I would like to point out a couple thing's about our trip that might help other visitor's to this area. We flew into Fort Lauderdale airport instead of Miami. This was way cheaper. I had contacted Larry's Limo ( which has their own website,give them at least a couple day's notice) and they transported four of us from Fort Lauderdale to the Holiday Inn for $120 which included gratuity. I think taxi's were charging about the same and we traveled in style. We had a taxi take us to the Carnival cruise terminal the next morning for around $15. We used Larry's Limo for our return trip back to the airport and it was slightly higher because they have to pay a port charge to pick you up at the cruise port terminal. He didn't charge you any extra for waiting for you to get off the boat. A great deal in my opinion. There were plenty of taxi's and van's outside the terminal if you wanted to catch a ride when you got off the boat though. I think anyone who is going on a cruise should spend at least a couple extra day's in Miami. There is so much to see and do here. Wish we would have stayed longer.Hope I helped give a little insight into what there is to see and do in this area. Happy travel's!

<Content>Not the hotel for you? The hotel is well located close to the shopping and restaurant area which was across the road. The check in was efficient and the small pool area was good to keep cool. The room and bathroom were clean and were of a good standard for the class of hotel.However I cannot recommend this hotel as it has very thin walls and this means that a good night鈥檚 sleep is impossible due to the amount of noise. We were continually awakened by noise from through the walls and also from above and below. If a good nights sleep is important 鈥?well this is not the hotel for you.

<Content>Very Unpleasant.. Our room on the 6th floor had a nice view of the ocean. But while we were there a big group of 150 teen tourists arrived from Brazil and had absolutely no manners, the worse thing about that the staff did not do anything about their rude behavior. If you want to stay there DO NOT go to the restaurant, you will not be happy with the food. The restaurant is only good for the breakfast buffet. There were also a few good things about the hotel. It was close to a beautiful beach and had a nice outdoor pool.

<Content>ok for 1 nigth we were for just 1 night, for shopping between flights. The staff was very kind. The check in time standard of hotel is at 3 pm, but we arrive at 11 am asking for leaving the baggage there while we went shopping and the have happily surprise us with the room already available!! The room is good, spacious and mostly clean. The bathroom a little old or without charm, but ok. The bad thing: the air condition was extremely high (not just in the room, also in lobby, elevator, all over!!), we turn it off but it wasn't enough.. Another contra: they don't have a parking, so you must walk.. I recommend the one is in the Bayside (across the street), not cheap but safer than others, especially at night.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Nice Staff We arrived at the hotel around 12:00 on Sat. June 14th. but the rooms (3) weren't ready yet. We went across to Bayside which was nice. We had lunch and did some shopping for our cruise the next day. Around 2:30 we went back over to the hotel and the rooms were ready. All the rooms (4th floor) faced the port which was nice. We could see the ships that were in that Saturday but the best of all was that when the next morning came we could see our ship. Freedom of the Seas. That night we all had dinner in the hotel. The prices weren't really that bad but alittle slow. Not much to do around the area at night. Some people on previous reviews talked about noise from Bayside and street noise. We never had any problems with this. The hotel is showing some wear. The wallpaper in our bathroom was not in good shape with peeling and other small issues. As long as the bed has clean sheets (and trust me they get checked all the way down to the bottom), no nasty things on the floor or elsewhere, a working tv and not smelly I'm happy. Listen we were taking my parents on their first cruise on Sunday morning. I would not take them or myself to a nasty hotel. That should say it all. It's a fine hotel for pre-cruising. Would I stay here for a week, no. A night, yes. It's close to the port and that is the whole point. A shuttle service (KMG) can be contacted for you through the bellman desk. We did this and it worked great. They picked us (7 of us, and alot of luggage) up on Sunday morning at exactly 10:00 am. It was $55.00 which was not bad for all of us.

<Content>Great Property! I stayed at this property from May 13 - May 16, 2008 for a conference that was taking place at Miami Dade College. This hotel was perfect. It had free internet access in the room and was within walking distance to Miami Dade College, Bayside Marketplace, American Airlines Arena, and Downtown Miami.The front desk staff was friendly, knowledgeable, quick, and efficient. We had breakfast one morning at the restaurant. The food and service were both great. The room was comfortable and clean. The only negative thing about this hotel is the parking. The parking is EXTREMELY limited. I would stay at this hotel again if the need arises. It was a pleasant experience.

<Content>Good location for pre-cruise I stayed in the Holiday Inn Port of Miami in May '08 with 4 other people. We took a shared ride shuttle from Ft. Lauderdale airport, which cost us $18 pp. The room had 2 full size beds with 1 pull out queen sofa. There was plenty of room for the 5 of us for 1 night's stay. My only complaints would be that the room was a little stale smelling, but it was horrible.The location of the hotel was great for us. It is located directly across the street from the Bayside Market which is a big outdoor mall, with places to just hang and listen to live music. There wasn't anything else within walking distance, other than Miami Heat Stadium.The hotel was pretty crowded, but we didn't have any trouble checking out the morning of our cruise. There were a few cabs lined up outside the hotel and it was only a 5 minute ride (about $6) to the port. I would definitely stay there again if I were cruising out of Miami.

<Content>Perfect pre-cruise hotel! We chose this hotel due to it's proximity to the Port of Miami for the night before the first cruise for our daughter and her children. I had requested rooms on a high floor facing the port and we were given rooms on the 10th floor next to each other which was perfect. The rooms were spacious, very clean and had the to die for view I wanted for this particular occasion. The front desk was very accommodating and check-in was quick and painless.The pool area was nice and the girls enjoyed it in the evening. It was possible to walk along Biscayne Blvd. about three blocks to the right and purchase a bottle of wine for the cruise and anything we had forgotten to pack at the Walgreen's there.

<Content>Not worth the price Good location for a pre-cruise hotel. I used hotel points to book this stay. I'm glad I didn't pay what they were asking. The hotel is older, so the room could have used some updating. The sink fixtures were loose, the wallpaper looked like it needed to be redone, and the general condition of the room added to the look of age.The Bayside area across the street came alive at night, so there's plenty to keep you busy. There are many restaurants, including Hard Rock, and many shops. Our room did not face the Bayside, so we did not have any noise issues. But the front desk did indicate that when bands play, that side of the hotel does get noisy.The hotel bar is small and so is the outdoor pool. The restaurant looked okay, though i didn't eat there.Taxi to the hotel was $25-30.Taxi to the pier was $15-20.I'm likely to look for a different hotel in this area the next time.

<Content>The staff and location was PERFECT! It was our first trip away from Canada so we were a little scared and new at the whole traveling bit. Needless to say our luggage somehow lost us on the way and we showed up at the hotel around 1am with nothing. We let the front desk know about our luggage and we were told it would be all taken care of should our luggage show up. The hotel staff offered us toothbrushes, toothpaste and other amenities to tide us over until morning. The hotel is right across the street from Bayside market - PERFECT location!! We had a ton of fun eating, shopping and eating some more. When our luggage showed up the hotel tucked it away nicely for us and waited for us to get back to the hotel. Check out was quick!Cons: The view wasn't the best, we looked onto a parking lot...but hey, we were going on a cruise in a couple of days so we didn't care. The only issue we had with the room was the sound of a clock on the street - some grandfather sounding thing...bing bonging at 5am...not so great when we didn't get to sleep until at least 230am.Rather far to malls - paid $40 to get to Dolphin mall

<Content>street noise unbearable! My family stayed here for one night before leaving on a cruise. The hotel was packed. Our room was ok, but nasty black mold on the shower curtain. We faced the port and shopping area, and the entire night we were kept awake by honking horns, sirens, etc. We were on the 9th floor. Noise finally stopped around 4 am. We were exhausted for our first day on the cruise. They had a decent buffet only breakfast, and the staff was helpful.

<Content>Location, Location, Location We stayed here prior to taking our cruise. Right opposite Bayside market place and the AA Arena.It is less than 10 mins by cab to the cruise port approx $16.Miami Int airport to hotel is approx 15 mins late night $23.Check in was fast and friendly. Good lobby area for waiting for anyone with plenty of seating.Room was a good size with a safe and large closet. Bathroom was clean but small.We were at the front of the building on the 6th floor. Great view but the noise in the early hours of Sunday woke us up. Especially the shouting at 6am-7am. If wanting a good nights sleep then ask for rear of hotel room and forget the view.If you are cruising then take this advice. Get your bags down stairs before 09.30. After that then be prepared to wait, sometimes up to 30-35 mins. They only have 2 elevators and come 10am, everybody is looking for them.You can leave them with the concierge and return for them before leaving for the port.

<Content>Loved the Port of Miami A friend and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami from Feb. 24 to Feb.29. We came in from a cruise to stay at the Hotel, and it is quite near the pier. The hotel was clean, and the staff were all friendly and helpful. The pool area was small, but most of the time we were the only ones outside at the pool. The resturant was ok for breakfast and dinner, but closed at lunch time. The food was pricey, but then it is Miami. The hotel is across the streel from the Port of Miami. This is a shopping and resturant outside mall. Besides eating and shopping, one can charter a boat to see the harbor and/or famous homes.

<Content>Good location for pre-cruise - but eat at Bayside This is an older Holiday Inn in the Port of Miami. The location is great - a five minute taxi to the cruise ships and across the road from Bayside which has lots of shops and bars with lively music and a nice atmosphere. One morning we sat at a cafe watching the pelicans and the dolphins swimming in the harbour.We had a room with a fabulous view across the bay. The room was clean with comfortable beds. Slightly damp from the Miami humidity - no heating so you need to switch off the air con to secure any warmth at all on chilly winter nights Staff are great and very helpful, especially Jairo the Bell Captain who goes out of his way to assist - and will book exactly the tours you want.The evening meal we had was not very good but Bayside across the road has loads of choice for food.Would recommend this as a short stay for cruises - great location.

Bayside is across the street with great entertainment and great food options.Front desk not very friendly. The hotel is not new, but did its purpose for us.

<Content>Great Location Holiday Inn Port of Miami is very central for both the city and the waterfront . The Metromover is two minutes away and is free! The staff are excellent and the rooms facing the bay have wonderful views. There is a nice outdoor pool with loungers. A good choice when visiting Miami.

<Content>Below Average Hotel I'm writing this review as I sit in the hotel room so I don't forget anything. I stayed here once before a few years ago precruise. I wasn't impressed then but I hoped it would be a bit better this time around. We get the stay free through reward miles. If I had to pay I wouldn't stay here.The walls are paper-thin. I can hear the conversation going on in the room next door. I've lost count how many times I've heard doors slamming. It was freezing here the other night. Tried turning on the heat only to find out the hotel doesn't have a heating system. Froze under blankets all night. They never bothered to make up the room at all today, nor did they do any of the rooms of the other people in our party. We had to go down to the front desk to ask for more towels and toilet paper. When people are arriving and departing for the ships the wait for the elevators and check in/check out can be very long.Their staff is friendly enough and the bed is comfy, and contrary to one of the other posts I read there is free wifi in the room but that's about as good as it gets.

<Content>Not great... No problem reserving or checking in, staff was nice. After paying $188.00 I assumed it would be a fairly nice room, I was quite disappointed. The room smelt like mold/mildew, the beds were old and uncomfortable. The location is great but, because of that it was very loud early in the morning with cars and trucks.I would stay there again for 1/2 the price but I don鈥檛 think that will happen.Cheers

<Content>Good place to stay before a cruise We stayed at this hotel before boarding our ship for a cruise. The hotel is good value for money. The location of the hotel is very convenient and you can see the beautiful port of Miami just from your room. In order to do that make sure you tell that you want an ocean view room when you arrive. Those rooms are also larger.I would not recommend to have breakfast at the hotel. In front of the hotel there are several places were you can have a good breakfast for half the price. There is also a Hooters, where you can order nice King crabs at reasonable price.The service at the hotel was friendly and in overall we had a good impression. We will definitely come back.

<Content>A Little Outdated, but GREAT Location OK, I have stayed here 6 nights during the past year. The hotel is a little dated and maybe needs to be modernized, but you simply cannot beat the location if you have business downtown or are taking a cruise. The port of Miami is directly across the street and the view of the cruise ships is fantastic.Rooms are about $200 per night, plus taxes and parking.Not a bargain, but try some of the many surrounding hotels and compare the price.No wifi but they do have a bridge which allows in room internet access. Small, 2 computer business center.Hotel food in reasonably priced and very good.Concierge is a wealth of information.Front desk customer service can be irregular, depending on the staff on duty. Few restaurants in the vicinity except across the street in the Bayside Marketplace...and many of those restaurants are very good (Latin Cafe, Hooters, etc).

<Content>Not bad... Not a bad hotel for the price. Its hard to find a reasonably priced hotel in Miami. The rooms were clean and well equipped, but like most Holiday Inns, its needs a good renovation. Staff were helpful and looked after any concerns. The hotel is in a great location right across from a large outdoor mall/market with great stores and restaurants. The Miami Heat play at the American Airlines arena about two blocks away. You are also about 5 minutes (About $10) cab ride from the Cruiseport. If you are looking for a good fitness room...forget it. Computers in the business area are very slow and outdated. Overall, not bad for what I paid.

<Content>Good for pre-cruise My husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn at the Port, pre cruise, on Jan. 1. We arrived around 1:00 p.m and when I requested a port view, she said we were upgraded to a suite. Nice. We had a separate bedrom ,living room and small kitchen area with micro, frig, sink etc. It ws nice to have the extra room but since it was just a one night stay, not necessary. It was clean and VERY quiet. Considering they were full, amazingly so. We were given a free buffet breakfast too, which was average. Filling. Being right across from Bayside was nice, as we spent the afternoon and early eveing watching all the activities. There is a liquor store nearby so we were able to get a few bottles of wine for the cruise. (We cruised on Oceania which allows you to carry on whatever you want. ) The front desk was helpful and the trip to the port was only ten dollars. A decent hotel pre cruise. Nothing real fancy but location is what sells it. We'd stay there again for the convenience.

<Content>great pre cruise hotel This is a great hotel to stay at prior to a cruise. The location was very good, across the street from the Bayside Market place. The rooms are small but clean and serve their purpose. Parking is limited and at an extra cost per day. Hertz rental car is just around the corner from this hotel and offers a free shuttle to the port of Miami. Very good shuttle service pre cruise but very slow when debarking(Others in our group booked Hertz and had a hard time get ting a shuttle post cruise). It cost us $15.00 to get a taxi from the port to the Thrifty car rental in South Beach and took us only 30mins from the time we left our cruise room to the time we arrived at the car dealer. Did not eat at the holiday inn restaurant but it was always busy. Lots of restaurants in the area including a McDonalds just out the back door of the hotel. Would stay here again if we were to book another cruise out of Miami!

<Content>Great Pre-cruise hotel My husband  I stayed at the Holiday Inn for 1 night prior to our cruise. The hotel is located right across from the Bayside Marketplace  has a wonderful view of the Port. We were given a 9th floor room with a lovely view of the port. It was cool to see our ship from our window in the morning! We arrived earlier than the posted check in time, but luckily our room was ready  we were allowed to check in. The front desk staff was very friendly  helpful. Our room was clean  comfortable. We were right across from the elevator but I didn't hear anything like I was afraid I would. With the Bayside Marketplace across the way, there was plenty to do within walking distance. The hotel has a nice pool  dining room and we were given a card for a discount on breakfast the next day. We could not get on our ship until 1:30 so we had a few hours between check out  leaving for port. The hotel stored our luggage for us so we could kill time without hauling all our stuff with us! Overall our stay was very pleasant and we would stay here again before cruising.

<Content>Good hotel , great location We had a one night pre-cruise stay at this hotel. Its location is its best asset. You are across the street from Bayside shopping and eating/entertainment. The hotel is clean and adequate for a short stay. It was a little noisy (we had a front facing room) but it was quiet after about 10.30pm. The staff were willing and helpful. We will certainly use this hotel again on our next pre-cruise stay!

<Content>Local Entertainment Stayed at this Holiday Inn pre Cruise with my wife and 2 children for the second time in two years. This hotel is located across from Bayside as others have posted and makes it easy to get a meal and do some walking around the shops. When staying at this hotel you should be made aware that if there is any type of entertainment at Bayside or the venue next to Bayside and you have a room facing the Port....IT WILL BE EXTREMELY NOISY UNTIL ABOUT 2:00 IN THE AM. Since staying here the first time I inquired about any events happening when making this booking and was advised that none were scheduled. Upon check in I asked again if any events would be happening during our stay and again told that nothing was scheduled. Low and behold there was an event with extremely loud music which started at 8:00 and lasted until past 2:00 AM. Contacting management I found out that in fact the hotel did know of this event, but SOMEHOW had failed to notify their employees?????? Management did compensate our bill for the inconvience which was appreciated, but it made for a very long night. Listed below is personnal insight.1) This hotel is located in Downtown (which is dirty) and is approx $20.00 cab ride to Port2) No grocery store within the area3) Liquor store 2 blks from hotel (expensive)4) Elevator's are small, book a room on top floor to eliminate long waits 5) After talking with cabbie's found out that South Beach is about 20 minutes away but if you stay on a weekend and drive or take a cab to South Beach it could take over an hour due to traffic6) Good breakfast bar7) Port facing rooms have a great view of ships (Freedom Of The Seas)(especially if you are awake when it arrives in the early am)

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami one night before our cruise. The hotel is very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. There is free internet access.. The beds were quite comfy. The smallish pool area was also clean and a pleasant place to sit and enjoy drinks. Drinks were not available until 5:00 PM. Breakfast was available in the hotel restaurant, the buffet was $10.95 per person. There is also a McDonald's a block away in back of the hotel. The only complaint I had was that the coffee at the hotel was terrible! We were 3 women going on a cruise so we got a room with 2 double beds and an extra cot. The cot was $10.00. Our room was very large and easily accommodated the cot. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is right across the street from Bayside Marketplace. A nice spot along the bay with many restaurants and shops. There was live music playing on the Sunday night we were there. It was a nice way to spend an evening before our cruise. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends and would stay here again.

<Content>Great Location-but everything else is just OK I am a Platinum Card holder with Priority Clubs. I called a day in advance telling them that I would be arriving early, which is a perk with Club membership. When I arrived early a room was not available. OK, so I walked over to the Bayside Marketplace for a couple of hours and had lunch and shopped, while waiting for the other friends I was meeing to arrive. When I walked back to the Holiday Inn I tried not to notice the man sleeping on the sidewalk by the corner of the Hotel. The room was clean, but the Hotel is obviously old and in need of renovations. The pool is small, and outdoor but walled in with no view other than the inside of the restaurant. The only Priority Card perk you will get here is $5.00 off in the Restaurant/per room. (alcohol not included) Check the Intercontinental just down the road if you want a nicer place for pre or post cruise. They view from our room was very nice, overlooking Bayside and the Cruise ships at the Port. Breakfast in the Hotel restaurant was good.

<Content>Great Place to Stay We recently stayed at the HI POM with 8/9/07 pre-cruise and this hotel more than met our needs. I booked 4 rooms for the 14 people in my party, we had 1 king  3 double rooms all with sleeper sofas, and each of the double rooms were spacious enough to accomodate up to 4 people and the king room up to 3. We arrived much earlier than the posted check-in times and they were more than happy to give us our room, the only thing was all rooms couldn't be on the same floor, which wasn't a problem for our group. My room was located on the 9th Floor (901) and we had an excellent view of Bayside Marketplace  the Ships in port!!! The room was clean and odor free, we did run into a small problem with our door not locking and all it took was a call down to the desk and within 15 minutes someone was there to fix it.I will definately be staying at this hotel again.

I would highly recommend this hotel as the price isn't to bad and the hotel was nice and clean! I travel alot and am very particular about my rooms. I had NO complaints what so ever!! Excellent location and there is a VERY nice area with shopping and LOTS of places to eat right across the street!! Lots of nightlife with music outside!! Nice place to unwind after airports all day!! They have sleeper sofa's in some of the rooms which I had a hard time finding at other hotels. If you ask for a late checkout they will give it to you! A cab is easily accessed for your trip to the port!!

<Content>Great for Night Before Cruise My husband and I stayed here on Saturday, June 30th, 2007 for one night before our cruise the next day. This is the perfect hotel to stay at the night before your cruise leaves. The hotel is right next to the Port. A short cab ride over to the cruise terminals the next day (Royal Caribbean was our cruise) only cost like $10. The cab ridefrom the airport to the hotel is approx $30. The Bayfront Shopping Market across the street from the hotel is great. We ate at Lombardi's Seafood for dinner in the Bayfront Market place and it was wonderful. I highly recommend the restaurant. There is lots of shopping in this Market place and at night, it comes alive with entertainment, music and people. They have a Hard Rock Cafe, a Bumba Gump Shrimp and other nice little bars to visit and the bayside of the market. This hotel is clean and nice. Ask for a room up high, you will be able to see the cruise ships in port, which is really cool. My husband and I had a king size bed room. It was up to standards of Holiday INn. Nothing special but nice  clean. The hotel restaurant served an okay buffet breakfast. The hotel will check your luggage into a secure room if you have to check out and wait until its time to go to the boat. We used this service and that worked out really well. We checked out, left our bags at the hotel and went across the street in the morning for a little last minute shopping before the cruise. In short, I recommend this hotel very much if you are going on a cruise that departs from the Miami Port!!!!

<Content>Great location!!! By far, the best thing about this hotel is its location! Holiday Inn Port of Miami Downtown is the closest hotel to Bayside Market and to the Port of Miami. The hotel itself was what you would expect from a typical Holiday Inn/Hampton Inn/Comfort Inn, etc. Nothing in the hotel blow me away, but I definitely can't give any negative criticism. The check-in process was great, and the room was nicely layed out  large. My room was on the 10th floor and looked out on the Bayside Market (amazing view of Biscayne Bay and the causeways). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would return there myself.

<Content>Great pre-cruise hotel! We stayed at this hotel last year at the end of September before a cruise, but I've just never gotten around to writing a review. So long time coming, here it is:I booked this hotel through their web site, and put in a request for a room on a higher floor with a bayside view. Since I was just paying for a regular room, I wasn't sure if that would be honored. But when we arrived I was pleased to find out that they did honor that request and we had a great view of Bayside Marketplace AND the port of Miami. (Very important when you're taking a cruise and want to wake up in the morning and see your ship there waiting for you.) This isn't a fancy hotel, but it was great for what I wanted. We were staying in Miami for two nights before leaving on our cruise. My son and I felt safe in this hotel and walking across the street to Bayside. (We even ventured down the block and around the corner to the People Mover so we could take the Metro line to the local museum. A little less safe feeling once we ventured away from the hotel  Bayside, but still was a nice little trip.)The rooms were nice, not too worn, but we couldn't get our windows open. (Maybe they're afraid of jumpers??) Be aware that if you are a light sleeper, you may want to bring earplugs because the doors automatically slam shut when you walk out of them and the banging can be heard from inside your hotel room. All around, I'd say it's a good place to stay before your cruise.

<Content>Very Happy!! I picked this hotel because at the time it was the only one that could accomodate 5 individuals. I read the reviews posted here and crossed my fingers.We arrived at 3:30 and the hotel was bustling but the staff handled it quite well. I requested a room on a higher floor and only had to wait 10 minutes before it was ready. The desk clerk was courteous and very helpful.The room was neat and clean. We did not use the pull out couch as the person slept on the couch but stated she was comfortable.Loved the fact this hotel is across the street from the Bayside. It was very easy to walk across the street to eat and shop. We were here during the Heat's final playoff but never felt the area was crowded nor loudThe view from our room was spectacular. We woke up the next morning to see not one but two cruise ships (one had our name on it). When checking out we found the lobby was chaotic but the concierge was cool, calm, and comptent. He arranged car service for our ride to the pier. I give this hotel two thumps up

<Content>Don't go on a Saturday night! We chose this hotel because of the reviews  wanting something convenient prior to our cruise. The room  hotel is fine. It was nice to walk across the street to visit the shops at the Bayshore Marina. However, on Saturday nights there is a constant blaring noise from the kids on the street with the music from their car steros. It continued until 1 am! The windows in our room were rattling! The hotel staff said it was a concert night - but talking to the locals, they said it happens each weekend. We were a group of 4 couples  one couple had a room not facing Biscayne Blvd. Their room was a lot quieter. We recommend that you request a room away from Biscayne Blvd.

<Content>Decent Downtown Hotel I stayed (by myself) at the Holiday Inn located at 350 Biscayne Boulevard, near the Port and downtown Miami for two nights; March 28-29, 2007; while attending a conference.The room was pretty decent, with a very large closet, comfortable single King Bed, the usual small bathroom; but with my smoke free request honored. I had made reservations on-line and checked in fairly quickly. The concierge was friendly and helpful when I asked about walking to a recommended restuarant called Garcia's; for seafood. He confirmed my choice but advised taking a cab, and he was correct. This is a very casual, locally patronized seafood place on the river, and was excellent. You should get a small order of stone crabs to go with the dinner in season. The hotel is across the street from the Bayside Marina, which is moderately hokey, but I had a pretty good Italian dinner at Lombardi's the next night.Miami is a construction mess and difficult to get around. Our conference was at the Hyatt Regency Downtown, which was within walking distance.I thought the hotel breakfast was pretty weak for the price, and walked over to El Cafe Restaurant in the Marina the next day. It was much better, although it does not open until 8:00 A.M., and the hotel restuarant opens at 6:30.The total bill (including all taxes but not breakfast) for two nights was $338.00. SuperShuttle to and from the airport is $16.00 pp + tip; and the cab websites said that the cab fare, per vehicle, is about $40.00; so for a couple it is about a wash.

<Content>Great view, but don't bring your car. Booking the hotel was very easy. The good things about the hotel are it's close proximity to Bayside, the American Airlines Arena, and Bicentennial Park for the Ultra Festival. Both were in very easy walking distance. If you are lucky to get a hotel room high enough and facing the street and the bay the view is wonderful. The worst thing about the hotel is not enough parking! Had I known that there were only about 30 places to park and that we would be charged $12 a day to park there, I would not have rented a car. When the when the lot is full the security staff and front desk are absolutely no help and couldn't care less what you do. You are supposed to park in a larger lot next door, and pay the lot people directly. You do need to let the staff know that you are parked there so you can be reimbursed for that night. However, if there is a special event going on in that area (in our case, a Miami Heat game) the parking fee for the lot next door (which is normally $12) shoots up to $40!!! There are a few parking ramps in close proximity, and meters out in front of the hotel, but you may not park there overnight. The staff is very aloof as well.

<Content>great value i always read reviews before booking any trips and have learned that you can take some of the reviews with a grain of salt..that being said, i have to say my husband and i are picky. i pre-booked this hotel a year ago and it was non refundable, so i was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews. we don't care if the room is 5 star but we can't tolerate bad customer service which was a major complaint in several reviews...we found the staff to be extremely friendly and as accommadating as anyone could be..the hotel was clean, the room was huge. we requested a high bay facing view and thats what we got. we had no problem getting elevators and the breakfast was a very nice buffet which was kept stocked and hot....bayside across the street has several wonderful restaurants. this was a great way to start our cruise vacation and i would most definitely return..the room was a little musty, but hey, you are in south florida..ps today i received a nice email from the holiday inn thanking me for staying there....if you have any questions, email me at cbchmbrln@ aol.com.

<Content>Only average Husband and I stayed one night pre-cruise in Jan. I booked nearly 9 months in advance and asked for high floor with view and got 3rd floor, no view. Can't hurt to ask.The hotel is in need of some serious updating and the front desk staff was less that helpful , including when we asked about a post office or stamps. Sent us on a wild goose chase 5 blocks away. The room was okay for 1 night with the exception being that the couple in the room next door were having an escalating fight that started about 10:30. We finally called the front desk when it sounded like it might get physical, and they sent someone up and the argument stopped until the next morning about 6:30 AM! Walls are VERY THIN. The couple on the other side were entertaining in regular voices but we still could hear their conversations.The service was very slow in the bar. Bartender was distracted by the room service phone she apparently was answering that evening. We did not eat in restaurant.Bayside Market is directly across the street and would recommend it for eating, drinking, shopping and people watching. We stopped a several outdoor bar/grills and enjoyed watching the ships come and go. Walgreens is several blocks down for anything you forgot. Next time we will spend the extra and stay at one of the nicer hotels in the same area.

<Content>Average 3 Star with excellent location Stayed one night before a cruise. An average 3 star hotel. A little dated, not great customer service and average rooms. Bathroom was clean, bedroom carpet worn but not filthy. Served just fine for one night stay. I would not want to stay here more than a night or two.Location for pre-cruise is excellent. Acoss the street from Market - can find cheap dinner if you go upstairs to the food court. There is a Walgreens drugstore about 4 blocks from the hotel. Don't walk alone and go before dark. Neighborhood is iffy.

<Content>Don't recommend this hotel to anyone We stayed at this hotel after our cruise, the staff were not friendly, half of them didn't know english, most were spanish speaking. The room we had was horrible, we had asked for a queen or king, we ended up with 2 double beds which were so uncomfortable. The halls smelled of water damage, the walls in our room had water damage on them, with bubbles in the paint. We stayed there 2 nights because we had paid for it, after the first night, our room had not been cleaned yet and it was 4:00 in the afternoon. We don't recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Problems with staff We stayed here for three nights for our trip to the Orange Bowl. The property could use some maintenance and the attitude of the staff could definitely use some improvement. Two out of the three nights there was no parking available for us. The night we returned from the football game, the guard who was locking up the hotel parking lot actually told us to go away! We told him we were hotel guests and had paid the $12.00 parking fee and he still told us to leave! We were left to find alternative parking after midnight in what can only be called a dodgy part of Miami. I would not recommend this hotel based on location, facilities and staff.

<Content>close to cruise line nice hotel let down by rude and agressive staff my party of 9 arrived tired and hungry after a long journey from Orlando we were not allowed to book in til 4.00pm, staff not interested that I had a young baby I needed to see to.Head waiter was a rude aggresive misogynist , who clearly had ideas about his own importance. Shouted at us across a packed resturant and abused us in Spanish to one of his collegues, stupid man as I understood every word he said, When I complained to the manager I was offered free breakfast, however he did not apoligise, he continued to give me filthy looks and posture around the resturant . Was so incensed by his behaviour escpecially to my elderly aunt that I wrote a written complaint before I left. But have not heard anything.Hotel is well located for criuse ships, and although could do with some updating was.fine for one night. However I took my sons to the pool whilst we were waiting to book in, and after a while it filled up with black insecta that looked like beetles or roaches. Took my sons out of the pool and complained nothing was done for a few hours and they merley scooped them out and said it wold be fine.I would ot return until they gave there staff accourse in customer service as the hotel on the whole is fine.

<Content>Absolutely the best hotel in Miami !!!!! Loved it As I write you , I have just arrived home from the Holiday Inn, Port of Miami. It was the most comfortable, the best location. My husband , My 2 kids and I were in town for the WWE wrestiling, and just stayed overnight. The staff was wonderful, the parking was a little cramped but hey at least you know your not parking in an empty lot. The room was so clean, didn't smell, and the bed, usually I can't sleep because the bed is just horrible. But I was pleasantly surprised and the great nights sleep I had. We splurged and got the 1 king bed and sleeper sofa suite, and it was soooo worth it. We are already planning a weekend trip. This was the perfect location, I went shopping at Bayside right across the street, great shops, great food, and their is a really nice starbucks their. Again, in the end, PERFECT is the only word I can use to describe the staff, the hotel, and location..... I loved it...

<Content>Loved the Holiday Inn This hotel was fabulous we stayed for a 1 night stay before a cruise....the staff was helpful in every way any questions asked we got an answer for it. The hotel was the right temperature it was nice and cozy and our room was the best we couldnt of asked for such and incredible stay.Its in the ideal location its right across the street from bayside market place wonderful shops and a huge food court also prices were really good we had breakfast over at one of the food courts it was a big breakfast that 2 of us had to share to eat it.The hotel was right across the street caddy corner from the miami heat arena matter of fact they had a game that night we were there.There is alot to do over at bayside there are millionaire cruises and all that in the bay right there its a nice spot to go sit and eat a little dinner or lunch or have coffee or a drink.we would highly reccomend this place for a one night stay or even several days stay it was wonderful they also have a restaraunt and have a small bar also on the premises....nice pool also right outside the dinning area.we could not say enough of how happy we were with our stay there.

<Content>Exceeds Expectations We stayed at this hotel for one night before a cruise. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room was on a high floor and overlooked the port and gave a good view of the cruise ships.Breakfast was buffet style and plentiful. If you join Holiday Inn Rewards scheme before making your booking you'll receive a discount on the hotel food.Check out was at 11am which made the lifts very busy and we witnessed some queues. However, we checked out at 9 and stored our luggage at the hotel which has hassle free.The shopping centre opposite the hotel is great for a one night stay. Shops, bars and eating places. Would stay at this hotel again without doubt.

<Content>convenient in staying pre-post cruise We booked this hotel by calling holiday inn because their website was not allowing us to book. To our surprise when we arrived at the hotel, they had booked 2 rooms instead of one and since the rate was non-refundable they didn't want to reimburse the second room. After waiting 15 minutes while the staff member spoke with the manager, they did credit our account...however they did not apologize and made it seem like it was our fault and they were doing us a favour. Otherwise the hotel is very convenient if you wish to stay a day pre or post a cruise. Bayside Marketplace is across the street...shopping, restaurants, entertainment and boat tours are found there. We were told by locals to stay at bayside and not go to downtown miami after 6pm as it is dangerous. The taxi to the port is a flat rate of $10. The taxi from the airport around $35.The rooms were clean, beds comfortable, bathrooms brand new. BUT walls were paper thin and everything could be heard from our neighbours.

<Content>Convenient Location Reviews of this hotel seem somewhat mixed but we were very pleased with it. We arrived at 7.30.pm after a Transatlantic flight but without our luggage which decided to spend an extra day at Heathrow. The lady on check in was very kind and gave us a large bag of toiletries saying we could keep any we didn't use. Check in was quick and efficient and my requst for a higher floor room overlooking Bayside was provided. We stayed here 4 nights prior to a cruise and whilst Miami isn't really a city break destination this is very good for that purpose being opposite the shops and restaurants of Bayside and a very short stroll around the corner to the Metromover which takes you for free all around Miami including about 4 stops away right to Macys door literally! We didn't eat at the hotel other than breakfast which was fine. The service, cleanliness, comfort of the beds and condition of the hotel were good also. We hired a car and parked in the secure staffed area to the rear (which has direct access to the hotel via the swimming pool area). Overall, whilst not having any gimmicks or flash facilities this proved to be a pleasant and relaxing start to our holiday and as such is recommended for someone wishing to be in the downtown area - though not, of course, near Miami Beach.

<Content>Hotel staff is the worst! Check in at 3:00??? We had to wait until after 5:00. I just wanted to get to a room. We booked 9 months in advance and no consideration was given to our room request. You get what they assign to you and like it. There is no help in the hotel, the lobby was full of irate guests, Rooms are assigned in alphabetical order in the morning of check in. My last name begins with T so I know that at any Holiday Inn, I am not likely to get my room request because I will always be at the bottom of the list. It makes no difference how far in advance I book it or what I request. I will get what they give me. I can book a room anywhere for less money and get boiler room accommodations.Priority Club membership means nothing, requests mean nothing, speaking to the manager means nothing, and check in time means nothing. I will never again book any kind of Holiday Inn Hotel.Jan

<Content>Great location! The start of a 10 day break in Florida and we really couldn't have booked a better starting point. Reception staff were friendly and speeded us through so that we were in our room within 10 minutes - great view straight across Bayside Marketplace and Bayfront Park.Room was clean and considering the location much larger than we were expecting - one king bed with the remaining space taken up by sofa, table, chairs etc where another king bed could have gone!Restaurant is OK... dinner menu is quite limited and one or two strange combinations but the food was good (we really didn't fancy venturing out on the first night after a 9 hour flight). Breakfast is typical Holiday Inn, either served as a buffet (weekends I think) and regular HI breakfast menu the rest of the time.All in all an enjoyable place to stay in downtown ideally placed for shopping and people watching at Bayside - and don't forget the boat tours of Millionaire's Row available directly opposite. The Hotel is also only minutes from the cruise terminals of the Port of Miami, and around 20 minutes from the airport (plenty of roadworks and building going on while we were there), and just a short distance to the new Carnival Center for Performing Arts.

<Content>Nice Hotel and nice location! We stayed here for 2 nights pre cruise, and it was wonderful!Everyone was very nice to us, it was a clean room which is very important to us more than anything else.My husband and I had never been to Miami, so we were hoping from reading all the reviews that we picked a good hotel and this hotel met all our requirements.We also liked that we were right across the street from Bayside and we were able to go to the outside mall, since we didn't have any experience in Miami we were not sure of our surroundings and was not sure if it was safe to go out at night, all we had to do was go out of the hotel and walk straight and we were able to eat and go to the mall.I would recommend this hotel to anyone, we really had a nice stay!

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed here one night pre-cruise on April 8, 2006. We checked in around 9pm on a Saturday night and was given a 10th floor room overlooking the port and the Bayside Marketplace which is right across the street. I signed up for the Holiday Inn Rewards club when I made the reservation through the ichotelsgroup website so upon check-in I was given a card for $5.00 off any meal purchased in the restaurant. Our room was excellant - looked like they could have fit 2 queen beds in it but we only had 1 king bed - sheets were clean and linens were clean, so no complaints at all about the room. Checkout on Sunday morning was a madhouse -- if you have lots of luggage I would suggest asking for a room on the top floor - we didnt have that much luggage but as the elevator made stops at each floor and the doors opened, we saw the frustrated looks on people's faces from floors 9-2 that seemed to me like they had been waiting for a free elevator for a looooong time. NOTE: there are only 2 elevators...2 very small elevators.Breakfast in their restaurant was okay - you could choose to have the breakfast buffet or order off the menu. The buffet was alright - my fiance had the skillet breakfast from the menu and he found it very tasty.There is a walgreens about four blocks away from the hotel that we walked to easily. I would definitely stay in this hotel again!

<Content>Brill hotel for pre-cruise!! We stayed here for just one night before a cruise and it was top value! It is a perfect location as you have the Bayside Marketplace just across the road and the marina etc. We ate out of the hotel at the Bayside Marketplace, there is a lot of choice of shops, bars, restaurants and a real nice place to go out. The cruise port is approx a 5min drive away in a taxi. The hotel itself was very clean and nice. I would definately stay there again so would reccomend to anyone!

<Content>Great for a cruise hotel If you are going on a cruise and plan to arrive in Miami the day before your cruise this hotel is an excellent choice. If you are going to stay more than one or two nights choose another hotel.The positives to this hotel is that it is incredibly close to the cruise terminal and is right across the street from Bayside market which is a fantastic place to spend a day. We found the room to be very clean and the king sized bed was very comfortable. The downsides are that other than Bayside market there is nothing else around to visit and the downtown area is not all that nice to walk around. The doors in the rooms have automated closing devices and the doors slam shut which is very loud. All in all not a great hotel but its location is just too good to pass on.

<Content>It was just ok My Mom and I stayed here before a cruise in Jan. 06. Maybe we were just there at a bad time. One of only two elevators was working, which was difficult when everyone was trying to get out of their rooms and down to the first floor at the same time. Had we not been in a hurry that morning, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. We ended up walking our luggage down six flights of stairs. The breakfast (and service at breakfast)was terrible and expensive. Either they don't have heat or the heat didn't work. I know that usually you don't need heat in Miami, but that night it would have been nice. Again, I'm sure we were just there at a bad time. It was in a nice location for us since we didn't have a car. It's right across from the Marketplace with shops and restaurants so that was great!

<Content>Great Service For a Moderate Sized Group This January 2006 my husband and I got married on a cruise and stayed at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami with our 50 guests the night before. The hotel staff was efficient with check in and check-out, and went out of their way to help us with special accomodations at the last minute. The hotel even posted our wedding on their bulletin board in the lobby. The rooms were clean and the concierge was helpful. The Bayside Marketplace offers a variety of shops and restuarants, though the hotel does have its own restaurant. Our party did eat breakfast at the hotel. It was just okay and the price was a bit high for the selection offered at the buffet. It was very comfortable and convenient though. Overall, our entire group's experience was amazing and we would definitely stay at this hotel again. It is perfect if you are going on a cruise, however be mindful that the hotel does not provide shuttle service to and from the airport or the port for cruises. Still it is only a few minutes and dollars away by taxi.

<Content>Great Value, Great Location My husband and I stayed at this hotel before departing on a cruise. We redeemed a free night from the Priorty Club which holiday inn participates. This hotel is about 15 miles from the Miami airport which is not bad in a taxi. We shared the ride with another couple and it cost about $24 ($12 apiece). We arrived before check in and the hotel was able to stow our bags. They provided luggage tags and gave us tags to match. They placed the luggage in a secured room. We went across the street where there is the bayside mall. We were able to listen to free music at the pier and have our pick of many places to eat like Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gumps. If you go to the Hard Rock and are a AAA member you can get 10% food and t-shirts. They have boats where you can take a 1.5 hour boat ride to see the sights. I think it was about 15 a person. We got back to the hotel at noon, which was still early for check in and we were able to get a room. We were informed that my husband was chosen for the Priorty Club member of the day and we were upgraded to a suite. The suite was located on the 5th floor on the corner so we had a great view of the cruise ship pier and the bayside mall. The room was tastefully decorated and it was clean. The king sized bed was comfortable enough. There was a safe in the closet and the AC worked fine. There was a seperate sitting area with an additional TV and telephone. A microwave, fridge and coffee maker. They provided popcorn, bottled water and coffee at no charge. My only complaint about the room was the toilet. It rocked back and forth. This was a livable problem so I didn't care. We were given a voucher for a free buffet breakfast the next morning. The dining room was crowded so I'd suggest that you would go earlier than we did which was around 10am. The food was decent. They had hot food and danish as well. You could order from the menu if you wanted. AT this holiday inn as at many kids eat free. We thankfully were able to travel without our kids this time so it didn't apply to us. If you do drive there you will be charged a per night parking fee. The hotel had an outdoor pool which was not very big but fine for a dip. They had a nice exercise room with two treadmills, an elliptical trainer and a bike along with some weights and a scale. The equipment was fine but the readouts on the elliptical were not correct. Our cab fare to the cruise ship pier was less than 10 dollars and was a very short ride. All in all our stay at this hotel was very pleasant and comfortable. We would stay there again and would highly recommend it to anyone who was going a night pre-cruise as this hotel is a perfect location and much less expensive than the hotels the cruise line trys to sell you pre-cruise.

<Content>It's okay... We stayed for 5 nights at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami. It is a pretty budget type hotel. It did have this musty smell throughout the room and the hallway. The concierge Daniel was very helpful and the Bayside Marketplace across the road was convenient and it is open till 11pm every night. I prob wouldn't stay here again. I would prob pay a little more and stay somewhere a little nicer. It is a 10 min bus ride away to South Beach. It's good if you are staying a few nights - but that is it. We loved Miami though!!

<Content>Average I stayed here with my wife and son for one night post-cruise. The hotel is decent, but the rooms were very cold. Normally, the cold might be welcomed in Miami, but not when the outside temperature is in the 50's, as it was the night we were there.We got the Best 4 Breakfast rate, which included a $20 credit for the hotel restaurant's (overpriced) breakfast. It was OK.I would recommend it only if you can get an advance purchase discount rate of $90-100. With parking, I paid a total of $160 for the night, which was too much for this average hotel.Additionally, the Bayside Marketplace across the street is little more than a mall food court with a few souvenir shops. Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. does have good food, however.

<Content>It was ok for one night... The hotel was just OK, not great or nothing to really talk about. But if you are taking a cruise and want to be close to the Port of Miami this hotel will do. The rates are good, but don't spend or waste your money on getting a Suite if your only going to be there for one or two nights it is not worth it. The Port of Maimi is very very close.

<Content>great location My husband and I were going to see a concert at the American Airlines Arena, and this was the least expensive place within walking distance. Perfect location with free parking and in/out priviledges!! You really can't beat that. After the concert, it was nice to just be able to run across the street to the Bayside Market, which is right across the street from the hotel.I had actually tried to get a room for both Sunday and Monday night, but Sunday was sold out. At 2am Monday morning, we were in town and called the hotel just to see if we could park there (and pretty much sleep in our car) because check-in wasn't until 3pm. The woman at the desk said I could check in to our room without paying for an extra night! At 2am!!! That was a Godsend. I couldn't believe how accommodating they were to our situation. Besides free parking, food right across the street, a business center and workout room, our room had a refridgerator and effeciency kitchen, iron, and everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. The rooms are clean, although the hallway carpeting is worn and the halls can smell a little stuffy. You can't beat the price and location if you're going to the AA Arena or on a cruise.

Huge closet (all those cruise bags, right?).Bayside was right across the street - there were numerous restaurants - including Hooters, Bubba Gump, Chilis. There were also traveler shops, food court, standard shopping, etc. Near the hotel is also a Walgreens for any last minute things you need.Taxis are out front waiting to take you to the cruise port.

<Content>Great Hotel in Downtown Miami We stayed at the Holiday Inn Port Miami in the middle of August. This hotel has an excellent location right across the street you have one of the most visited spots Bayside. The hotel is nice, not too fancy but has all of the elements to make it a 3 star hotel. The staff is pleasant and Hugo the Concierge is very helpful... The rooms are big and some are renovated. Beware, if you reserve here try to ask for the rooms that face Bayside they are more spacious and updated. I've stayed here in June and was given a room facing the port. Those rooms were much nicer than the rooms on the back. This time around, they put us towards the back of the hotel and the view was nothing to write home about. Also ask for King size beds... the double rooms have full size..who fits on a full size nowadays??? We paid $120.00 for the night, that included breakfast for two.. so in the middle of August thats a great deal. Also bare in mind that parking is extra.. I don't understand why, but that is Miami for you... The parking is limited on top of that so you may not have a spot secured if you arrive to late.. oh and they also close the gates after midnite, so ask if you will be arriving late. There's much to do at night right across the street so you may just want to park and walk... they have bars/ restaurants/ and live music every night... The hotel's pool is not big, if you want to get some sun you need to wake up early as the sun disappears quickly over the building. Some of the rooms need improvement, but overall clean... the hotel has a great location and price which is better than staying at the hotels in SoBe.. Oh another thing if you are not driving, save your money on cab fare as they will charge you about $25.00 each way to take you there. Ask Hugo, the concierge, about the bus they only cost $1.50 each way and that is a great savings...

<Content>Enjoyable pre-cruise stay We stayed at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami for two nights prior to a cruise in August, and were satisfied with our stay. We had requested a room with a king size bed on the tenth floor with a view of the port, and all of our requests were met. One bonus about staying on the tenth floor is that the ceilings are extra high, making the room feel more spacious. The room itself was standard, but clean and comfortable and felt relatively new. Perhaps they have renovated recently?? The breakfast buffet was I felt a little overpriced but was fine. The pool area was small but was nice with music playing to block out the sound of the surrounding traffic. The location was ideal, with Bayside Marketplace just across the street. Although I would not spend more than a couple of days in downtown Miami, the hotel is ideal for a brief pre or post cruise stay.

<Content>Pretty decent....But...... My friend and I chose this hotel due to its close proximity to the port since we were going on a cruise the next morning and because the Bayside Marketplace was across the street offering shops to explore and several nice restaurants to eat at. The hotel was nice. We were very pleased with the room itself, especially the bathroom. Just off of the lobby is a nice dining area and bar. I had a delicious breakfast the morning we checked out to leave for our cruise. Our ONLY complaint was that it was very difficult the sleep because of all the slamming hotel room doors. All of the doors have automatic spring closers, which cause them to slam shut. We stared at the ceiling for hours unable to fall asleep because of all the noise it was making up and down the hall. If it weren鈥檛 for this I would give this hotel 10 out of 10 points. Being used to Super 8 and Motel 6, I would say this was a very nice hotel but because of the trouble sleeping I would probably pick another place next time. If noise like this doesn鈥檛 bother you鈥hen this is the place to stay!

<Content>Close to the pier, but that is about it! We stayed at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami for 1 night prior to our cruise. The lobby was nice and we checked in early. Our room was on the 9th floor and had a great view overlooking Bayside Marketplace and the Pier. It was great to see our ship in the morning. But those are the only positives. The room smelt of mildew and we were awoken several times throughout the night be people getting off the elevators and their doors slamming behind them. We could also hear our neighbors on both sides very clearly. The food was ok, but not spectacular. I would spend the extra money and stay at the Marriott or Hyatt next time.

<Content>I enjoyed staying there I stayed there for three nights this past week. Lobby was nice. Check-in time is 3pm but I arrived there at 12:30pm and they were able to give me a room right away. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my room, it was very clean and nicely decorated. I loved the big t.v. The bathroom was small but it was also very clean and had a granite countertop and a shower head that had multiple spray settings. The restaurant was terrible. Do not eat dinner there. I ordered the shrimp scampi the first night and I couldn't eat it. The second night I ordered the grilled salmon with rice - the salmon was very dry and the rice was hard. The daiquiri I ordered was not very good. Too much ice. Their breakfast menu was okay, better than dinner. Room service was fast getting the meals to my room.I also loved the fact that they had a laundry facility and a business center that had free internet access. Made my stay a lot better.Bayside was just across the street. I had lunch at Bubba Gumps - the fried calmari was very good.I would definately stay there again. It is in a great location and the room was very clean. The only thing they need to do is change all of the chefs in the restaurant. lol.

<Content>Not What I Expected! We stayed here for one night prior to a Cruise. This place isn't what I expected. The rooms were smelly and the faucets in the bathroom were loose. There was Only 2 windows in the room which over looked the air conditioners on the roof. We requested a Port View, but I really don't think you could see the Port from any room. We had to pay $10 a day to park, which I think is crazy since we are paying to stay there anyway. We had a room for 5 people and only had enough towels and wash cloths for 4. When we called to get additional towels and wash cloths they brought us 2 of each. So we had to re-use towels the next morning for our shower. The front desk staff wasn't friendly at all. We stood there forever before they finally looked up at us to check us in. The Continental Breakfast was a joke. We had to pay $9.99 for each person to eat and what tipped it off they added a 15% Gratuity and they never touched anything. We got our on food and drinks we never were approached by anyone except to give us the bill. I wouldn't suggest this hotel for a long stay.

<Content>It's nice until you get to your room... If your main priority is being close to Bayfront Park, this is your hotel. But that's about it. Room was moldy. We had a smoking room but the windows were bolted shut. Housekeeping service was horrible. They would sort of clean your room and not restock all of your towels, shampoo etc. Front desk was slow and unresponsive. I would've been better off at the Courtyard Downtown.

<Content>Location is it's best asset! I stayed at the HI on a Saturday night prior to boarding a ship sailing out of the port of Miami, along with 22 other people. Although there were mixed reviews from my group on quality of accommodations, we all pretty much agreed that you couldn't beat the location for the purpose of our trip.We were all able to check into our rooms fairly quickly, there were 8 rooms in all. The rooms were adequate; our bathroom seemed to be recently retiled and was clean. We were on the bayside, so it was a pretty sight at 4:30am when we were able to see our ship positioning itself in port.Getting breakfast in the hotel on Sunday morning was a bit difficult. They had quite a line waiting to be seated. Also, kids eat free didn't apply to the breakfast buffet (FYI). The service in the restaurant was definitely not efficient and quick, and the food quality was mediocre. There really wasn't any place else to have breakfast either.Check-out time was the biggest headache. Mostly everyone in the hotel seemed to be staying there for the same reason....leaving for a cruise. At about 10:00am the lobby was jam-packed, the elevators were full, and would go up and down without getting down to the first floor to let people off. My husband and my son finally took most of the bags down by the stairs, but they could only get down to the 2nd floor through the staircase, so they had to wait until they could get on an empty elevator for the last floor. It was crazy!! The bell captain was busy taking people's suitcases after they'd checked out so he couldn't help that much with questions for transportation. We were supposed to have vans take us to the pier, but we ended up just walking out and taking cabs because we got tired of waiting for him. The cab fare was $10, and it took just about 5 minutes. If you choose to take van shuttles, it's $5 per person. Would I stay here again? Absolutely, but I would make sure that I'd beat the rush in the morning, or I'd wait it out until 1 or 2p.m. and have my bags held after check-out at 11:00am.Bayside is a great place to visit for the evening. We ate at Bubba Gump's, which was a great experience. You can't make reservations, but when our group arrived they were able to seat us in about 15-20 minutes. The service was quick, prices were reasonable, and the waitors were lively. We were out of there in about 1 1/2 hours. There was a band playing near the water, and various other entertainers around. It was a pretty festive atmosphere.Feel free to email me with any questions.

<Content>Great Pre-cruise Hotel We just returned from a one night pre-cruise stay at the Holiday Inn - Port of Miami. I found the hotel to be clean and accomodating of my requests. After reading several reviews, I requested a room facing the bay on the 6th floor or higher...I got it. The view was wonderful and made us all the more excited about our cruise. The convenience of being able to walk to the Bayside marketplace across the street was absolutely wonderfull. We were not interested in going to South Beach because we were only going to be staying in Miami one night, but having shopping and entertainment so close gave us something to do that evening. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel and would recommend it to anyone. I will be staying here again for my next pre-cruise stay.

<Content>good room with reasonable rates My family and I spent a night at this Holiday Inn and had a very good experience. We booked the room through Travelocity and got, what I thought was a very reasonable rate ($87). We were cruising out the next morning on the Explorer of the Seas, so when I arrived, I asked for a room with a view of the ships. They granted my request without hesitation. I was also pleased to find out the Bayside was right across the street. This is an area right on the water of shops, restaurants, bands that play outside! Restaurants included Hard Rock Cafe', Hooters, Chile's, Bubba Gump's. We spent the whole day there with a group of friends who were cruising with us. We even spent another day there when we returned from the cruise while waiting for our flight out! Also the Miami Heat's arena is right in that area also.Considering all of the above, I'd recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Room with a view! We stayed at this hotel beginning of March 2005. Taking the advise of previous reviews we asked for a view of the port. We were lucky enough to have our request granted and the view was worth the accomodation price alone. The hotel staff were very friendly, efficient and helped with any questions asked.The location was also ideal, close to Bayside Market and only a short taxi ride to South Beach.When we return to Miami we will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Clean and calm in a bustling metropolis  My 9 year old daughter and I stayed here for one night after a cruise. I rated this hotel above average because it was nicer than I expected for a typical Holiday Inn or comparable hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. They let us check in early--about 10:00 because we arrived immediately after disembarking from the cruise ship.My package included a $20 breakfast allowance which we used on the breakfast buffet because the cinnamon roll french toast they advertised was not available during the two mornings we were there. However, it is my understanding that the hotel was booked up solid until the day we checked in (Spring Break and Easter Weekend) so it's possible they ran out of the cinnamon roll french toast. It really looked good on the menu though.The room was very clean and cool. (Our previous hotel, the Fairfield Inn Airport South was quite the opposite. It was dark and dingy.) We had views of the Bayside Mall across the street and the cruise ships in the background until they departed. (We sadly looked upon the Majesty of the Seas which we had spent our weekend on.)Cabs were pretty abundant until we were rushing to catch our flight the next day. However, we took a cab the first day to South Beach and back--cost was roughly $15 each way). The following morning we caught the bus to the Aventura Mall which was typical of a large mall. The bus ride was approxiamtely 1.5 hours. On the way back, we learned how to catch the express bus , but we were still rushing to get to the airport.My only problem is that the hotel would not honor a late check-out of 2:00 p.m. I felt it was the attitude the desk clerk I asked because the hotel clearly was not half full so I felt they could have accommodate us. But I could not complain because they clearly gave us an early check-in. I just felt so misplaced without having a room to go back to. We locked our luggage up with the bell station and proceeded to the mall to hang out for the entire day. Keep in mind the clerk was not rude, just not accomodating!Oh, one other thing, I was unable to print my boarding pass because there was a problem with the internet service the hotel offered. But had it been working, it was a great free service that they offer--to use the internet for free. So don't forget to print your boarding passes and seat assignments.Other than not receiving the late check-out, our stay was good and I would not hesitate to stay there again when I take another cruise out of Miami--which I am sure I will.

<Content>Nice hotel for the price, clean and quiet This was a nice hotel for the price. This hotel is an older hotel but the rooms have been recently updated and are clean and modern. The room was small but sufficient with nice appointments. The bathroom was clean and even had a granite sink. The location of the hotel is good, it is right across the street from the basketball stadium and a nice shopping area. Would stay here again.

<Content>Doing it all over again We(group of 10) stayed here October 2, 2004 before we boarded the Explorer of the Sea's the next day. Most of us arrived at the hotel before 2:00pm and rooms were ready for some of us, and Maria was really generous to the one's who's rooms were not ready. She ended up giving all of us rooms that faced the port, so we could see our ship pull in that morning. We paid $83.99+tax for our rooms and it was wonderful. They offer a nice breakfast in the morning for additional cost.This year we are doing a cruise in August and we are already booked at the HI once again, I guess it is the second time around

<Content>Great place to stay before cruise With some trepidation about the area in downtown Miami we decided to reserve a room at this refurbished Holiday Inn. Comments on this forum encouraged us. We got there two days before our cruise and had a really good time exploring the Bay Market Place and park across the street. Around the corner from the hotel is a free Metro Mover monorail which we rode in both north and south directions for a view of downtown Miami. We did not get to South Beach but it was quite accessible by taxi or bus from our location. Holiday Inn was clean and friendly. We had a great view from our ninth floor room and can recommend it as a nice place to stay if you wish to arrive early for a cruise. Price was great as we reserved many months ahead. Room was $101.00 plus tax. The area was fine to walk around. It is near little Havana which is all spanish speaking. We enjoyed breakfast at a little street cafe there. The Bay Market Place is safe at night but you wouldn't want to walk anywhere else in the area after dark. Not enough people around. All in all we had a great stay. Nothing negative.

<Content>Great pre-cruise Hotel!!! We paid $105 plus tax so $115 for one night pre-cruise at this hotel on Jan 13, 2005. We booked it 8 or so months in advance and asked for a room high up overlooking the pier. We were supposed to be in Miami around 12:30 pm. Unfortunately, we had weather problems that caused flight delays and missed connections. I called the hotel to advise that we would be arriving late. We didn't end up getting there until almost midnight, and figured we'd get the worst room in the hotel since we were probably the last to arrive. The hotel was fully booked that night. However, upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised. We were given a room on the 10th floor overlooking the pier. It was a gorgeous view at night and in the morning. Also, although we had not tied our reservations together, we were only a couple of doors down from family who traveled with us, which worked out nicely.   The hotel itself was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. This hotel is just across the street from Bayside Marketplace which is a great place to shop, eat, and walk around near the pier. Unfortunately, we didn't get to do that on our first day, but did a little bit before going on our cruise the next morning. This hotel is also only 3 blocks from a Walgreens to pick up any soda/water or other necessities prior to the cruise. Beware there were a lot of homeless people around when we got there at midnight, but otherwise it was a GREAT LOCATION and I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great Place We arrived the day before our cruise was to depart and met another couple that was going to sail with us. We were allowed to check in early. The other couple had already checked in so when we arrived we asked the front desk if they could move them to adjoining rooms with us, which they did. Shopping across the street at Bayside was a good experience, lots to see, large variety at the food court other restaurants (Hard Rock. Chili鈥檚 ect.) with in walking distance. Checked out at 11:00 was effortless and Taxis were plentiful. We boarded the ship after we checked out. We plan on staying there again next year when we go on next years cruise.

<Content>Great for pre/post cruise We just stayed here Jan. 13, 2005 and the 17th, for pre and post cruise nights. The hotel itself was fine, typical Holiday Inn with a restaurant, a small pool and the rooms were clean. The best part of it was the location to the cruise port and mainly the Bayside Marketplace across the street. Lots of great shops and booths set up, good restaurants (Chili's and Hard Rock- and Hooters if you're into that). It's about a $25 taxi ride to the airport, and about $10 to the port. We hopped on a bus that took us to South Beach which is where the nice beaches to swim and lay out are. There's no water access from this hotel, since it's more of a marina/port type waterfront area. I'd probably stay there again, just for price and convenience, even though South Beach looks like a better place to stay for beaches and amenities (it's just a lot farther from airport and cruise port, which means more taxi $ and higher priced hotels).

<Content>Wonderful place to stay We arrived early and had to wait 2 hours before getting into our room, the bellman stored our luggage and we took off to the Bayside Marketplace directly across the street with plenty of shops and places to eat. Our room was wonderful with the refridgerator, microwave, sofabed and, chairs overlooking the marketplace. We were very thankful for the self service laundry. Staff was courteous and I don't know what the bellman makes but he deserves a raise!

<Content>A good precruise stay We stayed here January 2004 before leaving on a cruise. We arrived early and did have to wait two hours before we could check in, however we were able to leave out luggage with a bellhop and walked across the street to Bayside Shopping and entertainment center. It was lovely. We had left Minnesota with below zero temperatures so sitting on the deck at HardRock Cafe and having a drink while watching the boats come and go from the harbor was just divine. We ate some lunch, listened to some salsa bands that were playing and then headed back to the hotel. It did take some time to actually get into our room as the line was VERY long at the check-in desk and service was slow, but we weren't going anywhere and we were on vacation...That evening we walked back over to Bayside and ate at Bubba Gumps. Very nice experience. It was a nice evening before our cruise. The next morning we did have quite a wait at breakfast and there were several families waiting to go to the port to board their ships, but it all happened in due time and I would stay here again. There was a Walgreen's within walking distance and we found we needed a few things for our cruise that we had forgotten to pack. It was convenient and non'threatening to walk the three blocks. We liked this pre-cruise stay.

<Content>Nice Hotel, but wouldn't do it again We stayed one night after a cruise, Nov 2004.When we arrived at the HI the lobby was packed with people waiting to check in or out for the cruises. We were happy that our room was ready. We were staying 1 night after the cruise. The room was very nice and the view of the bay and the cruise ships was beautiful. I could have sat looking out the window all day but I couldn't wait to get down to the pool. The pool is very small and the water was freezing. There is construction going on right in the back of the hotel. The seating area is also very small and most of the loungers were taken by people who have all their luggage. I guess they were either waiting to leave for their cruise, an air flight or a room. Because of all the high buildings there really was not much sun.We stayed at this hotel because the last time we were in Miami we went to the Bayfront shopping area and had a good time. The second visit was disappointing. The area seemed different.I also want to let you know that if you are returning from a cruise the taxi drivers do not want to take you from the port to the hotel because it is such a small fare. There was a moan when we told them where we wanted to go and the taxi driver seemed mad that he got such a small fare and the only thing he said was I want 1 dollar for the bridge toll. It's a 6 dollar fare. At least the 4 dollar tip made him smile.Since our cruise came in early in the morning, the next time I would book a 2o'clock flight and take the tour offered by the cruiseline to the Everglades or go all the way to the airport and stay at one of those hotels if I needed to. There is nothing wrong with the hotel. I just would do things differently next time because I felt bored and thought that it was a waste of time sitting at the hotel all day when I could have gone home.

<Content>DISAPPOINTED AGAIN We've stayed here before, but not when it was a Holiday Inn. Despite lots of fanfare, not much seems to have changed above the lobby floor. The location is still the best thing this hotel has going for it. Registration was okay (at 8:30 am) once they found our paperwork, which took ten minutes. I returned at 3 pm to check in, and all was well. Sixth or seventh floor, as requested, bayside, near the elevators. Things went well till I got up at 7 am, used the bathroom, turned to flush, and found myself staring at a 2-long palmetto bug (Florida cockroach, to you non-Floridians) on the floor next to the commode! A ten-minute battle with the in-wall hair blower and a bottle of hair lacquer ensued, but in the end, we were victorious. A talk with the Rooms Manager got us half off the bill (originally $89 + 13% tax). Check out went smoothly, we stored our bags, and went out. When we retrieved them, the strap on one inexpensive vinyl rolling bag snapped, but I was in a hurry to drive home before dark, so we left. At home, we discovered that someone on the hotel staff had put three staples into the strap, in an attempt to cover up the damage THEY'D done! I'm debating what further action to take, up to and including disputing the rest of the bill. Unfortunately, there's no real alternative to this location, until the Everglades-on-the-Bay reopens, one block away. WE CAN'T WAIT!!!!!

<Content>night before our cruise Nov 6 2004 A great location. Right across the street was Bayside with the mall and several restaurants. Beds were very comfortable and the breakfast was delicous. We stayed overnight before our cruise. Taxi from the hotel to the port was less than $10. Staff was very friendly and helpfullMy only complaint was at checkout, dozens of other guests were leaving for cruises too and the elevators were terrribly slow. We tried the stairs, but none of them led to the lobby! You had to wait for an elevator.If you are taking a cruise out of Miami, this is the hotel to stay in before or after.

<Content>Nice hotel for the price! This is a nice hotel for the price. We booked this hotel for a one day stay on 10/24/2004. The lobby was very nice. The check-in process was easy and quick. The front desk person was very helpful. The room was small but that was ok because it was just a one day stay before going out on our cruise. The bath room was newly remodeled. The bed was pretty comfortable. The room was clean. Nice size TV. The very best thing about the hotel was the location. The Bayside Market place is right across the street. Many shops and a great food court. Water is everywhere with great views of the city and Miami Port. Great music and dancing. The Miami Port is a 5 minute cab ride for about $7.00 I would stay at this hotel again. We paid $69.00 + tax.

<Content>Nice rooms, good price Stayed at the Holiday Inn Marina Park on September 24th, 2004 for one night prior to driving to Kissimmee.Very nice hotel. The rooms are a bit small, so i would not recommed it for long stays. Everything in the room (and all of the hotel) seems like it's pretty new. My guess is that it must have undergone a renovation recently. The private parking in the back of the hotel is a plus. The location is also great, since it's right across the road to Bayside Marketplace, which is a shoping mall right on Biscayne Bay offering quite some stores and restaurants.The price of the room (we got it at US$ 89.00 the night) was very good, considering the location and the competition (other hotels in that area were eighter cheap but bad or nice but outrageosly expensive). I would surely recommend this hotel!

<Content>Much better than expected! 9/11-9/13, 2004. We booked a cruise from the Port of Miami and wanted to stay somewhere close as we arrived 2 days early. I read reviews of the Holiday Inn - Port of Miami and they were mostly poor to fair.Expecting the worst, all four of us were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were big and clean, the staff was very friendly, and the location (right across the street from Bayside Marketplace) was FANTASTIC! Yes the pool was small, but I came here for a cruise, not to swim laps. We paid $85.00 per night (booked throught Holiday Inn website), and it was money well spent.I will definitely stay here again the next time I cruise out of Miami.

<Content>Pre cruise favorite We chose Port of Miami Holiday Inn to be close to pier for a cruise. Taxi fare to hotel was $24.00 from the airport and $10.00 to pier the next morning. We decided to go this route instead of the airport hotels with shuttles so we could be close to Bayside to have something to do. The hotel was spotless and the staff very friendly. Our room was more spacious than other Holiday Inns we've been in, and we had the great view of three cruise ships coming in to port. We ate meals at Bayside, many restaurants to choose from. Breakfast much more interesting there than at the hotel too. We plan to come again on our next Miami based cruise

<Content>Nothing special, and overpriced We go to Miami once a year to stay overnight, for the fabulous Miami Book Fair. We've stayed here six times over the past 10 years, both as a Holiday Inn and as a Best Western (till 2003). The location cannot be beat for the heart of downtown Miami, with access to Bayside across the street, and the port, American Airlines Arena, and shopping nearby. BUT when the owner switched affiliation to Holiday Inn, the prices skyrocketed and the policies changed to require multi-night stays, cancellation fees, etc., so we went elsewhere in 2003. The hotel is said to have received a complete makeover in 2003; if so, it was badly in need of one. On our last stay, the toilet ran all night, despite repeated calls for maintenance (no one on duty at night, we were finally told); we shut the bathroom door rather than shut off the valve. We shall see, now that prices have come down a fair bit, whether things have improved, when we stay there later this year.One bit of advice: if you're too near the top floors, you hear the frequent airplanes overhead, all night long; if you're too close to the ground, the noise from open-air concerts at Bayside can be deafening. Best bet, stay on the 6th or 7th floor. Also keep in mind that not all floors have ice machines, if that's important to you. Also handy to know: there's a second, unisex public bathroom on the second floor, right next to the elevators (where the marketing office used to be).Now, if the renovation has changed any of this, I'll be sure to let you know.
