<Content>Good cheap option Hotel is conveniently located, 100 m from main railway station. Friendly staff, clean, good breakfast but small (perhaps too small) room and possibility to hear what is going on in other rooms. Still good choice considering 65 Euro per night for triple room. Perhaps allocating non-smoking and smoking rooms on the same floor is not very good idea.

<Content>It's nice! I was very happy;  I was really happy with this hotel. I just stayed there for one night overnighting in Frankfurt. After feeling ripped off in Amsterdam, getting a rather shabby hotel in Barcelona, and having a terrible experience in Dubai, I was elated to have found this hotel. My only regret, truthfully, is that I did not shorten my trip at one of the abovementioned destinations, flown back to Frankfurt, stayed in this hotel, and explored the area... Oh well, such is life. At any rate, I think I was so happy with this hotel, again, because I just had a series of either bad ones, unsavory ones, weird ones, or just subpar accommodations. Last year I stayed around the corner at the Hotel Paris, which did not compare to the Hotel Europa. This hotel is easy to find. I would highly recomend staying here  in town if you have a stop-over in Frankfurt  not at an airport hotel. Not that I have stayed at an airport hotel, but after researching like crazy for my trip last year, they seemed expensive, with nothing to see. It is pretty easy to use the metro to get into town,  cheap, too, at 3.70 euro one-way  2.20 euro at off times, such as before 6:00 AM and other times. When you come up the escalator after getting off the train, turn right, there's a sign in the train station that points to the Ibis Hotel. You want to go in that direction. It's only a few minute walk on the main street. There are restauarants around this hotel that look good, including a pizza restaurant. The front desk clerk was very warm, welcoming, with a big smile, and very helpful. He immediately gave me a map  wrote on it, circling where the old town was at  gave information, such as restaurant times. The off-season rate that I paid was 49 euro, including tax, vat  breakfast!!!Amazing for what I got!!! The hotel had a lift. I was only there from 9:30 PM to 0400 AM. 6 1/2 hours. Too bad. I wanted to stay longer. Thus, I didn't eat breakfast. But the breakfast room looked very nice. Cloth table cloths and napkins, etc. The lobby was very nice. It looked like a leather seating area. I might be wrong. It was dark  late when I arrived. There were lots of brochures  info on the area. And a container full of umbrellas for guests to use. Nice touch! The room itself was very nice. Full size bed. White duvet/comforter, down pillows. Nice bedside lamp. Built-in headboard with the lamp on it  a phone, wake-up call, which I used. Immaculently clean. Nice desk  chair,  a built in thing to put your luggage. Free wi-fi in the room  a computer internet for use in the lobby. Nice flat screen TV with many channels. Textured walls, tasteful artwork. The whole room just seem very well appointed. Nice curtains. A mirror. Artful thing on the wall to hang your clothes. A closet. Neat looking clothes hanger thing in the bathroom. Water pressure, hand-held, was the best pressure that I have eve experienced!!!Really!!! The toilet was a charming European-style, I guess, different then I'm used to. Amenities such as shampoo and soap were provided. There was a little bit of mold in the shower, but hey, you can't have everything! And, honestly, I was so delighted in this hotel, it didn't bother me in the slightest. Mini-bar with see through glass. Couldn't believe that one! Again, really, for the price! I wish I wouldn't have been so tired  needing to get up in a few hours, or I would have enjoyed something out of it. The next morning I couldn't believe the price of the items. 1 euro each for chocolate, beer, soda, bottled water! There were two drinking glasses placed on a tray on little doilies. And a can of nuts on a tray with a bottle opener on top of that. The windows were large  opened up to the street. I guess you might have heard street noise, but I always bring wax swimmer's ear plugs, so it was okay. It's too bad that both times I flew into Frankfurt it was late, with an early morning flight, or I would have really enjoyed walking to the apple wine taverns and the old town. It's only about a 20 minute walk from this hotel. Next time, I will schedule a little more time  do this. I highly recommend this hotel. I'll will definately be staying here again if I go back to Frankfurt! Bravo!

<Content>Basic but clean hotel, great location, excellent service Stayed for 3 nights at the Europa. Room was fairly small but very clean and had everything we needed. Staff on reception and in the breakfast room were friendly and helpful. The hotel is situated in an ideal location close to the main railway station, and we used the tram using the very reasonable Frankfurt Card which gave us 2 days unlimited travel and saved us 10 Euros at one of the museums we visited. The only minor gripe is that there are no non-smoking rooms and the last resident had obviously been a smoker - however, we left the window open whilst we were out and got rid of the worst of it. All in all, happy to recommend.

<Content>Nice  I stayed recently at the Hotel Europa in Frankfurt and it was a good stay. The hotel is situated 2 blocks from the main train station. I was allowed to check in early 9 am with no x-tra charges and in addition luggage storage all day for my night flight back again no charges. The rooms are very simple, clean, and for the going price it is very fair. The breakfast was nice all you need to get off to a good start-, breads, cereals, juice, etc... The only complaint I had was with a bit of street noise with a few ambulances with thier sirens blaring. I gave 4 points based on good freindly desk service, a clean safe room, breakfast. You won't get a massage, shoeshine, valet it is not that kind of hotel. But for a basic room at a good price close to the cental station it is well worth it

<Content>Helpful, friendly staff. Highly recommended This is a family run hotel, and its shows. The staff are the most helpful and friendly that I have encountered. While rooms are small, they are very well kept. The hotel could not be located better, being near the central railway station, with a tram stop outside the door. The area is quite. All in all, well recommended.

<Content>Fabulous breakfast buffet, free use of computer to check email We were very impressed by this hotel. The staff were top notch, helping us with our visit to the town and providing us with maps of the city and the best way to walk to the things we wanted to see. The breakfast was great, with a beautiful buffet of cold cuts, hard boiled eggs, toast, jam, fruit, yogurt, cereals, juice, and even a cappuccino machine! There were two computers in the lobby where guests could check their email for free.The rooms were very clean and had a great TV with remote control. We thought this was an outstanding location right near the train station, perfect for our one day layover.

<Content>Really great hotel Really nice hotel..just 5 minutes of Haubfbanhof station and the tram is really near. Very friendly and helpful staff, they help me with everything. Great breakfast, different options. I have no complains about this hotel..very clean, bathroom was fine. A little bit noise yes because of the street, but no sleeping problems. For the price that I had payed for 2 nights, it worth it. I really recommend for every kind of travelers.

<Content>The perfect place to visit Frankfurt We were searching for a good accommodation in Frankfurt when we found out this hotel on hostelworld.comThe price was ok and we booked it even if we were a little afraid about all those stories we read on the internet about the main station and the heroin addicts.We spend three nights there and had no problems : neither with bag snatchers nor with junkies. I have to say that Baseler Strasse seems to be safe enough, it' s thousand times better that the other streets around the railway station.The reception is open 24 h and the men at the desk are all so kind and take care of you.The room was perfectly cleaned besides, there was air conditioning and wi-fi connection. The mini bar was great too : water and snacks costed only 鈧?1,00 ( you can buy your bottle of water outside, but you pay 鈧?1,00 + 0,25 of Pfand ... ).Breakfast was served untill 11:00 a.m. and was delicious.Another good thing is that they do the cleaning from 12:00 a.m. so you can sleep more than in other hotels.If you' re travelling with Ryan Air the Bohr bus station is two minute walk from the hotel, by the way the receptionist can give you all the information you need. He also gave us two bottles of water for the bus journey ... just adorable.

<Content>Best value we found! As budget travelers, we thought this was a great hotel for the price. In fact, the best we experienced on our recent trip. Since we flew through Frankfurt (FRA), we decided to overnight in town, coming and going. The hotel is centrally located--literally around the corner from the central rail station, which is less than 15 minutes from the airport by train (less than 4 euros one-way).The staff here is quite helpful and responsive. We got good directions on places to eat and how to get around.Admittedly, the rooms are tiny but clean. But we asked for a quiet room and got one on the top floor with firm mattresses. A very good breakfast is included, with meats, cheese, softboiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, juice. Even the in-room minibar items were reasonable: only one euro for Coke, beer or snacks. And free internet access in the lobby. The trams (streetcars) stop directly in front of the hotel, providing quick access to the rest of the city. Frankfurt is not known as a tourist destination, but there are a few nice museums and good restaurants close by. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A 1.5-star hotel at 4-star prices My tiny room, with two single beds, could barely hold one person, let alone two. The room was clean, but worn and old. The floor area was so small that there was nowhere to put a closed suitcase without it being in the way. Free wifi is offered, but there was no desk or chair, nor even an accessible to plug one's laptop in. In order to work, I had to move the minibar and unplug it to get power for my laptop, and then sit on the tiny bench that was provided, with my laptop on my lap (which, despite its name, is not a good thing to do). The bathroom was clean and functional. Breakfast was mediocre.Security: The hotel still uses metal keys, which must be left at the front desk when you leave the building. Fire safety: There is only one set of stairs. The firedoor was wedged open. A vacuum-cleaner cluttered the corridor all evening.I paid 139 euros for this on a night in which just about every other hotel in Frankfurt was booked out.

<Content>Great Location, Awesome Friendly Service Great Budget hotel near the main railway station.There are many hotels near the main railway station. If you are stopping over in Frankfurt then it is an easy train ride from the airport to the main railway station, and then a 5 min walk across the road to the Hotel Europa.I have stayed in other budget hotels in this area before. What made our experience at the Hotel Europa special was the customer service that we received. We arrived very early in the morning due to an overnight flight. Obviously our rooms werent available at that time of the morning, however the owner was able to work some magic and get us some beds to sleep for a few hours whilst our rooms became ready. The staff at the front desk were very friendly the whole time, it was a litlte like visiting some friends.The rooms were small but clean and did the job.We took the tram into the city centre, Christmas Markets area.

Staff speak great english and are the most helpful i have encountered in a long time, giving tips on where to visit and how to get there, we were provided with a map which proved invaluable. Breakfast is great and there is a wide selection to choose from. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Value for Money There are many hotels located near Frankfurt main station, the location of Europa Hotel is excellent. You just need 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to main station. The staff there are very friendly, willing to answer your question. The beds are quite comfortable and all rooms are ensuite so you have enough privacy. They even have a small lift so you don't have to take your heavy luggage upstairs! In each room, there is a small refrigerator with some snacks and drinks (1 euro for all stuff) and even a LCD TV with numerous channels!!The breakfast was ok, they provide bread, cheese, cereals, coffee, tea and milk, the taste was ok. The price is reasonable for such hotel with convenient location, I am sure I will choose Europa if I am going to Frankfurt again.

<Content>Fine, but slightly noisy I stayed there at the beginning of february this year together with my boyfirend for 2 nights. All in all, everything was just fine - great location (right next to the main train station and busses to Hahn airport), firendly staff, good breakfast, a really comfortable bed and a clean room. But one of the things that i did not like too much was cleaning staff making noise in the corridor because as the door was quite thin, a lot of noise came in but it was even before 9am. We were lucky not to have many loud guests on our floor, as otherwise i think we would not have had much sleep. Also, our room was right next to the staircase - so even more noise. I mean, it was not very bad, but then again, as i said already, there were not many loud guests. And another thing that i disliked was that due to the Messe-season, the room was priced slightly above 100 EUR - normally i would not pay such money for such hotel (maximum EUR 60-70 for the room), but because there was not much choice for that time - we stayed there. All in all - good, but if you have time or location is not so important - i would suggest to consider some other options as well, especially if you absolutely cannot stand noise during the night.

<Content>Good value for money Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in mid-April and I have to say, it was very good value for money, if looking at it as a 2-3 star property.The fact that the rooms are somewhat outdated and on the smaller side, our twin room was clean, adequate and quite quiet (5th floor on the back of the house). We had some minor problems with aircon, but it got solved after we called down to the reception.Breakfast is German standard and anything you might ask for in a hotel of this kind. The prices for the minibar were cheap.Staff at the reception were many, very friendly and helpful and they all spoke perfect English. They gave advise on where to go and what to do. Always with a smile on their face.There are also 2 computers in the lobby, however, one of them was not working. Did not bother us though as we were there to see the city, not to search the web.We were able to leave our luggage at the reception after check out and the location near the main train station and the buses to the airport couldn't be better.For a weekend with friends in Frankfurt this hotel is good, however, I wouldn't book a romantic weekend here. The area can be a bit noisy due to heavy traffic.Tips: Ask for a room high up, on the back of the house, it seemed less noisy there. Don't miss the Persian restaurant Hafez next door - amazing food!

<Content>Budget experience Four of us stayed here for one night in December. This hotel is located close to the main railway station ( and near the red light district ). Its a 15 minute walk to main shopping district.We got the room for a very good price because they overbooked, when we were meant to have 2 seperate bedrooms. Instead they gave us a 4 bed room. This room was small, located 4 floors. you'll need to carry your suitcases up because the lift is small. The bathroom is very small, but good water pressure. The room is dark, not very clean and the bedding is very old with springy mattress and beds which creak. The reception man seemed a bit overfriendly, offering one of the girls on our trip some earrings (from where?).Breakfast is provided. There seemed to be a lot of workers having their breakfast here. Standard european variety with bread, fruit, cereals and toast. We were glad we were spending one night. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you are on a shoe-string.

<Content>basic but good value I stayed in this hotel during the world cup of 2006. It is in a very good location, close to the trainstation and a short walk to the river which is one of the best features of the city. The rooms are small but we didnt spend much time in them there was air conditioning and a small fridge which helped as there was a bit of a heatwave on. The staff were friendly and hotel clean Frankfurt is a beautiful city and I would go back, I would also go back to europa.

<Content>Good for a weekend It's a well located structure, very close to the rail station, undergound and bus station for the Hahn airport.It has 7 floors served by an elevator (which was out of order in the second day) with few rooms per each. Mine was a tiny double, with a decent bathroom. Many noises came from hosts in the other rooms in the early morning. Hygiene was good such as the bed, the breakfast was in the average and the staff very gentle. The best choice for a short-term stay at just 55 euro ppn.

<Content>single room double price I had booked a double room through a website, then I called to check if there was a single available as I was going to be on my own. They said fine, no problem, but don't bother to cancel the original booking. We'll take care of it when you arrive. When I got there I was given a very small room with just ONE single bed, so I expected a single room rate as well. But when I checked out I realized that was not the case. Single room, double price.

<Content>Good Value for Money A small but very centrally located three star hotel. Staff is very helpful, flexible and children friendly. I was there with my whole family on a semi-business trip and will surely return. Only shortfall is the noise of other guests in the corridors, coming home late night. Room doors are not sound proof.

<Content>Great breakfast, great rates, rooms could be better This hotel has a lot going for it. In a city like Frankfurt, it offers good nightly rates, and the free and plentiful breakfast is very welcome. The location, less than 5 minutes' walk from the Hauptbahnhof main train station, is also excellent for those coming from other cities in Germany or the EU, or from Frankfurt airport.However...the rooms are not up to scratch. When we stayed there, the room we were given was not very clean. The shower had a mechanical bit which had fallen onto the floor. And we had to report this twice before anything was done about it.
