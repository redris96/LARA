<Content>Fantasic Budget Hotel I loved my 4 nights at Hotel Sampaoli this summer! Leonardo and Riccardo were great hosts - as has been said here many times - and the rest of the staff was welcoming, too. It felt much like staying with friends as I was greeted warmly on all my comings and goings.The single room I stayed in was clean and cozy - I loved the fact that I had a wardrobe and drawers as well as a tv and dvd player. Like others who have reviewed this hotel, I am a women who was traveling alone and this was a perfect place to stay. I especially appreciated Leonardo's great email communication in response to my questions.This is a great place to stay for a budget traveler who's looking to be in a safe area in the city center. Yes, there are shared bathrooms. Yes, there is street noise at times. But, this is a budget hotel and a delightful one at that. Plus, no matter where you stay, you're in Florence - don't spend time in your room!

<Content>Fabulous would stay there again!! Excellent location just a short walk from all main attractions yet at same time a few minutes away so a quiet night's sleep. Lovely staff who gave SO much info about city that you didn't need guidebook and could just take their hightlighted!! map and go and see the sights. Very clean room; we had ensuite at the back which was most quiet and only one with a/c so good. Also DVD player with DVDs to lend and 2 laptops with free internet till 10pm.

<Content>Very friendly, neat, clean hostel (not hotel) I stayed for one night, but arrived at 7am on the overnight train from Nice. The staff e-mailed me in advance and were kind enough to let me leave bags, have a shower and change clothes, even although it was too early to check in.I had a single room, which had a reasonable bed (double) for a hostel, with ensuite bathroom. The room looked out on to neighbouring back yards and, at one point, there was a bit of noise from them, but not late at night.There was free wireless internet available throughout the hostel and they had two computers for those without their own.The hostel is a little hard to find, not being obvious from the street. You will be looking up the street for a hostel sign, but there is none. Go to door number 14 and look closely - you will see Hotel Sampaoli on the doorbell. Ring it, and you'll be let in, once you climb the considerable stairway to get there.Staff are extremely friendly, helpful and chatty. You cannot go wrong with a stay in this place, if you want a hostel, but remember it is not a hotel, despite the name.

<Content>Very pleasant little hotel with great staff I stayed at Hotel Sampaoli for 5 nights during a conference in April 2008. The Hotel is conveniently located, easy walking distance from the station and all other major sights. The rooms and bathrooms were clean and provide all necessities for a short stay in the city.The major plus of this hotel, however, are the staff. Being family-run by two brothers who speak excellent English, the service couldn't be better. They will make sure you are comfortable, advice on (really!) good local restaurants and will book major museums.The only two potential pitfalls are a very ordinary-looking entrance with a very subtle sign (I walked past it three times before seeing it) and no lift. But if you are looking for a small, family-run and friendly hotel, you will be hard-pressed to find anywhere as pleasant and convenient as the Sampaoli. Big thumbs-up!

<Content>5 Star Hostel Booked 3 night stay through Hostelworld.com, We arrived by train from Rome and the hostel was no more than 5 mins away. We booked a private ensuite room and were shown into our room before having to check -in fully. Then we got to encounter one of the two best hotel staff we'd ever meet (we meet the other later) we were sat down to check in, and then given a map of Florence, next we where shown where all the main sights, where to eat for dinner and for lunch, where to shop and where to go for a drink. They even rang ahead one night to check how busy a restaurant was before we set out walking there. Next we were given what was probably the best piece of advice, stop eating only pizza and pasta, there is so much good food in Florence! The facilities while limited by hotel standards where still great. We even had a DVD player in our room and a selection of DVD's available to us, for when we'd taken in too much high culture!We had a wonderful stay here, and with such friendly  helpful staff it felt like being welcomed into someone's home. If (when) you decide to stay here make sure to ask for their recommendations!

<Content>Great little Hostel I've stayed at a quite a few hostels throughout my travels, and I believe that Sampaoli ranks highly among them. I am a 32 y.o. male, stayed for 7 days. The key points of interest for Sampaoli are:+ it's really close to the major attractions of Florence+ the staff (esp. Leonardo  Ricardo) are extremely friendly and helpful. + it was relatively quiet while I was there -- of course don't expect quiet sleep anywhere in Florence during the daytime!+ the room I stayed in (room 7) is a single with what Americans call a full sized bed, and has it's own private bathroom (quite nice). Other shared rooms have multiple beds and shared bathrooms -- all of which were quite clean. + Typical age ranges of the people visiting the hostel (during the week I was there) are 18 - 25, with a majority of Americans/Canadians, Italian, some Japanese, some British, and Mexican... a really diverse but fun group. + Very safe environment: each room has a lock, and there are two doors to reach the outside. I would think this is an ideal hostel for solo female travelers (there were several during my stay). + Internet access is slow compared to the U.S. -- there are two computers for internet use, which are typically shut down at 10:00 pm to provide peace/quiet for the nearby rooms. Secure wireless internet is also available, but I couldn't receive it in room 7 (furthest from router). + The hostel provides bar soap/shampoo/towels, maps of florence, guidebooks that you can borrow, a moderate selection of DVD movies that you can watch in your room, and a common refrigerator/coffee grinder/microwave, etc. + You may want to bring your own pillow or ask for extra ones, they are pretty flat there. + The roads from Santa Maria Novella (train/bus station) to Sampaoli are paved with paving stones, and can be quite bumpy when dragging a suitcase (this is true of central Florence in general).+ Petty theft/pickpocketing/purse snatching/suitcase snatching happens -- always be aware of these things. Your items are relatively safe in your room, I left my laptop there and money laying about for 7 days and nothing disappeared.  Overall my experience there was quite great and I highly recommend this hostel as a launching point for your Florence and surrounding area tours!

<Content>Great Budget Hotel On my second visit to this fine city I stayed with 2 friends at the Sampaoli. The staff was great, the room was clean, and the location was perfect. My only complaint would be the shared bathrooms, but even they are on par for Europe. Be warned if you have lots of luggage: NO ELEVATOR! On the positive side of that, even though we had minimal baggage the guy checking us in helped the 2 girls up with theirs. For the price you can't beat it. Those that have complained about this place really shouldn't expect 5 star accomodations at these prices. I feel that for what we paid we got an above average room and service.

<Content>All around Awesome!! My friend and I stayed here from another friend's referral. We had an AMAZING time. Leonardo spoke fluent English and hilited the sights to see, restaurants to eat at, and other places to visit. He was very easy to talk to and took a personal interest in each traveler...making sure we all enjoyed our time in Florence and the neighboring areas. The rooms were nice and the bathrooms were always clean. I couldn't have asked for a better location and staff. I felt like I made a genuine Florentine friend by the time I left!!

Arriving with no guide books, they provided great recommendations and equiped us with a map. The Hotel is located near all the main touristy spots but also on a quiet street. Would definitely stay there again!

<Content>A wonderful hotel Initially, I was hesitant about staying in a pensione as I am not a pensione kind-of girl. But, I was more than pleasantly pleased with Hotel Sampaoli; in fact, it made my holiday in Florence. Conveniently situated next to everything (10 minutes on foot), Hotel Sampaoli is ideal for any traveler. The rooms were clean and whimsically Italian. Amenities included free internet access (and wireless), a mini espresso machine (perfect for caffeine addicts like myself), complimentary towel and linen service, bookcases lined with city guides and DVDs for a night in, and staff who always greeted you with a friendly 鈥淐iao.鈥?A true home away from home, yet distinctly Italian at the same time. Take a minute to talk with staff as they are incredibly helpful and hospitable. My travel companion and I received recommendations to authentic and inexpensive Italian restaurants, suggestions for nightlife (places where one is sure to converse with locals), and help navigating Italian railways on expeditions to hilltop towns. I believe when you travel it is not just about the places you see, but the people you encounter. Hotel Sampaoli and the staff will forever be intertwined with my Florentine memories.

They are also very accomodating to any of your needs.Very clean and well maintained.Very good location, only about 5-10 minute walk from central sites, shopping, train station.Free Internet.Sink and Mirror in each room even in shared bathroom price.Cons:Very Ordinary Room.No Breakfast (Not that's there is such of a breakfast anywhere in Italy from what we experienced!)I would not hesitate to stay there again, but I also might look for another place too.

<Content>Great place to stay in the heart of the city We stayed at Hotel Sampaoli while visiting Florence to attend a wedding. There was a large group of us there, and we occupied three rooms. The staff is really nice. Both of the owners, brothers Leonardo and Riccardo, made us feel at home, did not mind our loud behaviour and gave us really good tips on local restaurants that are not tourist traps. The rooms are bright and airy, very clean. Its a great place to stay if you are on a budget plus the location is super. Its right in the centre of the city, easily accessible to all the major sites, restos and shopping. We will stay there again on our nice trip to the fun city of Firenze!

<Content>Friendly brothers My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the hotel, even though our room was one of two with a shared bath - it was right outside of our room and never a nuisance. The entrance stairs completely contrast with the bright interior decor, everyone was friendly, the free internet use is great (as is the message at the computer if it is in use) and the location is near the San Lorenzo market - a must visit to check out all the food stands, and San Marco and the Annunciation Chapel, the latter behind a plaza that has an avenue with a great view of the Duomo.

<Content>loved the Sampaoli! The entrance to the hostel is up a steep and bare stone stairs. This is deceptive to the warm and cosy atmosphere inside! This hostel is a family run business and the staff could not be more pleasant and helpful. The rooms are clean and well serviced. We had free WiFi in our room so we could use the internet FREE 24hrs a day! , which we were not expecting.The location could not have been better.I can happily recommend it. However stairs make it unsuitable for the elderly and the disabled.

<Content>Loved staying at the Sampaoli I only have one word to describe it: Perfect. It is a simple place with a unique atmosphere. Everything was spotless clean, the location is excellent, within walking distance of everything. The staff is very very nice and helpful, they are always there for you to answer your questions and to recommend you places to go out. It is a family run place so you feel the kindness and the hospitality on the air. For a young woman, traveling alone I felt very safe staying at Sampaoli. This was the third time that I visited Florence and definitely it has been the best place that I have stay on this fantastic city.

<Content>Certainly Hostel Sampaoli NOT Hotel Sampaoli We stayed here for three nights in September. Overall would not rate this as a highlight but then it was also the cheapest place we stayed. My key message is that for a hostel this place would be a delight, for a hotel, you can do much better. We met quite a few people out at dinner who had paid ten euro more to stay in much nicer places. The bathroom of our room (number 13) was unclean and I knelt on the floor to see if something had fallen under the bed... if you have a squeamish stomach or savour personal hygiene - I wouldn't recommend following suit. Having said that - we went and looked in the communal bathrooms for shared rooms and they were spotless.The location is very good, easy walking distance of the sights.Overall, if you are looking for a hotel, I'd recommend looking further, if you are looking for a hostel - I'd recommend Sampaoli.

Our double room was good value and reasonably clean. Once you find the place (Florence in general is hard to navigate), there's not much to complain about considering how much you're paying.The stairs are a bit annoying if you have heavy luggage but you get what you pay for and more.

<Content>A backpackers delight! As a backpacker traveling around Italy in the month of August I came to the conclusion upon my return that Hotel Sampaoli was not only the best in facilities, but also the best in service. It was a delight to be checked in by the very knowledgeable staff and it was a pleasure to sleep, shower, and stay in the stellar location of Hotel Sampaoli. Originally I chose that particular hotel based upon all of the wonderful reviews that I had read of it, and all of them held true. Leonardo, the owner, was an absolute gem! He was very helpful in navigating the city (and always provided a suggestion or two). I would recommend Hotel Sampaoli to anyone and everyone who travels to Florence. I wouldn't imagine staying anywhere else.

<Content>Moldy Bathroom, Garbage in Bedroom We were very disappointed with this 'hotel' stay. Upon arrival, there was mold in the bathroom along with a great deal of hair in the drains. In the bedrooms sloppily patched walls complemented garbage items that were not picked up by any form of cleaner before our check-in. If you can avoid this place, I would. Spend a few euros more for peace of mind.

<Content>Just OK, you can do better. It was an okay place for the price but spend 12 Euros more and you can do much better. We could only stay one night and the staff were pretty unfriendly/unable to help us find accommodations for a second night. We found a place online down the street that was only 12 euros more a night with a private bath, an actual double bed rather than two twins but together, and air conditioning. It felt like a luxury hotel compared to Hotel Sampaoli. The place was Hotel Bellettini-72 Euros a night compared to the 60 at Sampaoli.

<Content>Great Staff - Great Location - Great Value We stayed at the Sampaoli for 3 nights and had a good experience. Very good value for the price. Contrary to other reviews, our room and bathroom were spotless. Also, we had 30 minutes of free internet per day which we were not expecting and fully utilized. We found all of the staff very nice and helpful (bearing in mind when in Italy, not everyone speaks fluent English!!). Also, we were very secure there. However, the manager, Leonardo really is the best public relations that any hotel could ask for. He speaks fluent English, he is very knowledgable and willing to go over and above to help. We had some confusion over our reservation and he rectified it immediately. Then we had trouble with our electrical adaptor and he helped us solve that problem. As an added bonus, he plays cool jazz music to create a peaceful ambience at the front desk. He explained to us what prego means in English, which no one else could. The location is outstanding. You can walk from the hotel to the train station and to any of the main tourist attractions. The coffee shop one block behind the hotel in Piazza San Marco is very reasonable. It is within minutes of a huge market that was open every day we were there. Two restaurants that stand out are Za Za's and 13 Gobi (hunchbacks) both recommended by Leonardo. We adored Florence and would highly recommend seeing the original Michelangelo's David in the Academy of Fine Arts, the Duomo, the Archeological Museum and the Uffizi Gallery. Another highlight was walking to the other side of the river to the Pizzale Michelangelo. Absolutely spectactular view of the city and beautiful gardens. Overall, this hotel contributed to a wonderful experience in Florence and we would recommend to our friends and family.

<Content>Not very cleaned I spent a couple of nights at the Hotel Sampaoli with a friend. We were both attracted by the good reviews on the Internet. We could not understand how this hostel could possibly be described as cleaned for it was anything but. On arrival we found out that the toilet had not been swept, there were lots of hairs on the floor and nobody cleaned it for the 2 days of our stay. The room was small and a bit uncleaned, too. On the first night we were woken up by noise in the street. Location was good and we did not need much help from the staff. Overall we would not come back there should we go back to Florence.

<Content>Good place but.. We had an adventure walking through Florence trying to find the hotel (we had thrown away our map and Florentines are not known for their direction skills obviously). Leonardo was fabulous, a real nice guy who made us feel comfortable. The room was a good size but the furniture looked as old as the building and the door was glass with only a flimsy piece of cloth covering it for some privacy. However, what got me going was the bathroom. It was huge and made for a handicapped person because the toilet seat was high up, railings covered the wall and the sink was enormous. We had a picture of a naked woman on top of our bed, my boyfriend and I laughed our time away by saying it was La Nonna (the grandmother) that lived and died in that room. Kind of morbid, I know, but the room, especially the bathroom, called for those kind of sick jokes.
