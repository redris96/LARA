<Content>Too many niggles I tend to visit Florence once a year and and on this visit, I wanted somewhere central and convenient for myself and, more importantly, my girlfriend's parents who came with us.In that respect, Hotel Bigallo is great. It is right opposite the Duomo and so you are about as central as you could be.That in itself causes a problem in that the Duomo bells ring out very early in the morning, preventing a nice sleep in if that's what a holiday means to you.The two rooms we had were almost identical - clean and tidy and well decorated without being lavish, and with showers instead of bath/shower combos. We took internal rooms to minimise the noise which helped deaden the crowd hum but, obviously, not the bells.Breakfast ran from 730-930, so again, not ideal if you wanted a lazy morning. The tables were slow to be cleared so we had to clear them ourselves to get somewhere to sit, and chase the staff for glasses, cutlery and for the various buffet plates to be replenished, which wasn't ideal. Breakfast was basic cereals, rolls and croissants and hams and cheese, which did the job, but I found the staff to be not always available when, at breakfast time, this was key.Most of the staff were friendly and, when I requested an extra pillow and for a shower in one of our rooms to be looked at, this was checked and fixed while we were out for the day.One elder gentleman was particularly lacking in customer relations courtesy though, which didn't impress me.All in, if you want somewhere central at a reasonable price, this is a good, modest choice.When I go away though, I expect someone to be available in the morning and evening if I have any queries, and I don't expect to have to chase breakfast myself, especially at these prices. Nor do I expect to be told off by an old man for asking for basic cutlery.So if you don't care about breakfast and either wake very early or take earplugs, this is a sound choice.If not.....

<Content>Wonderful location We stayed at the Hotel Bigallo on the recommendation of a friend, and were not disappointed. It was an easy walk from the train station, even with our luggage, and a great location (the windows opened up to a very close view of the Duomo). It was an easy walk to everything in Florence. The room was spacious and attractive, and the breakfast OK. It was noisy outside, even at night (just shut the windows for quiet). There was an computer in the lobby you could pay to use for email, etc.

<Content>I thought this hotel was great I am surprised at some of the reviews--I did not think that the hotel was hard to find. When we arrived, we did have to take the elevator one person at a time (there were 3 of us) because the elevator was so small. I thought our room was very clean, the bathroom was spacious and looked as if it was recently remodeled. The view of the duomo was great. The location was within walking distance to many great places to eat and shop. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful (although some did not speak much English), they arranged for museum tickets and tours. The breakfast was simple but good. When we checked out, we paid with a credit card; they never asked us to pay cash. Overall, I was very pleased with our stay at this hotel--I would stay there again.

<Content>Nice stay I've read all the mixed reviews about this hotel, but I have to say that I had a pretty nice stay here. The room was somewhat small, but it was clean. The bathroom seemed to be newly remodeled and had marble floors. You can't beat the location. It's directly across from the Duomo and right off Calzaiuoli, one of the main shopping streets in Florence. The staff was kind and helpful. The only unusual thing was that they would only accept cash, no credit cards.

<Content>Close to the Duomo If you want close to inexpensive and convenience, it's the place for you.It is verrrrrry hard to find, even with directions. You enter in an alley way off a main street.We were 4 and the rooms were adequate. The woman who checed us in was very inhospitable.Our room had a decent view of the Duomo and we were glad to lay down at the end of the day, until we hit the mushy mattresses. The bathrooms were very cramped. When you sat on the pot, your legs were in the shower (which is ok if you want to do two things at once).Ok breakfast; the best thing about the place was the young man who had the afternoon shift. He gave us two great recommendations of restaurants (one was 4 stars in Fodor's which we overheard after we were eating there). He made reservations and called us cabs. I wish I knew his name but he was the only good thing about Hotel Bigallo (it is pronounced Big Gallo like the wine, not bigalo like a gigalo).

<Content>Hole in the Wall We stayed here for one night in May. This tiny hotel is across the street from the Duomo which is a wonderful location. Beware that when you arrive there is no lobby. You have to carry your luggage up a flight of stairs to a small elevator. No signs are posted but inside the elevator it says that the third floor is the Hotel Bigallo. There you find the reception desk. However, the room was clean and the breakfast OK.

<Content>Fantastic stay at Hotel Bigallo We have stayed at Hotel Bigallo twice in 2006 and would definitely recommend it and would have no hesitation in staying again and recommending it to others. Be warned entrance looks nothing from the outside but worth climbing the steps to the hotel lobby and rooms! There is also a small lift!Wonderful location, very comfortable rooms with everything you need especially fantastic views of the Duomo. When booking we suggest that you ask for a room with a view! Very convenient for sightseeing and restaurants.Breakfast was basic but adequate.Anna the receptionist was extremely helpful and spoke excellent english. The hotel like you to pay cash for your stay!Worth a stay and value for money as in the heart of Florence!

<Content>Not bad...... This hotel is in a great location....directly across from the duomo. It's a small hotel and has continential style breakfast every morning. It was clean and had cute European feel about the place...the only down side was it was very noisy outside (the Duomo attracts big crowds, the piazza has tons of people). We could hear the noise even when the windows were closed at night....people were out until 1am or longer. It was a good place to stay, but if you want quiet evenings, I would choose another place.

<Content>A fraud We too had the same experience. We booked this hotel after the good reviews on trip advisor but we were extremely disappointed when we arrived to find it was not open. We were moved to a different hotel, which was of a much lower standard. We would not have stayed in this hotel if we had not arrived so late in the day. Despite asking on a number of occassions, nobody seemed to know why we had been moved. I would be interested to know if anybody does get to stay in Hotel Bigallo, and if it is still of the same standard as the reviews suggest.

<Content>Fraud and Unethical We booked this hotel for our recent visit to Florence. When we first arrived in the city, we called to get direction. The lady who answered the phone represented herself as from Hotel Bigallo. She was very courteous and gave us perfect direction to the hotel. The nightmare began when we arrived at the front door of the hotel. She told us that the hotel was closed and that she would take us to another property nearby (a much worst one). We were so puzzled, and disappointed. But given the short notice from her, it would be impossible to look for another hotel at the spot. We had no choice but to go with her. After check-in with this other hotel, we met three other groups who were in the same boat as us. They told us to contact the booking agent to find out how this could happen. We did, and the booking agent was under the impression that the hotel was open for business. We then decided to check on the internet for sites such as hotels, expedia, venere. To our suprise, all of them had received no notice whatsoever about the closing of the hotel for the winter. In fact, the hotel was still taking reservations for the same week we were staying in Florence(and they were actually closed). Many of us who booked through internet were totally not impressed by this. Our booking agent told us to make sure we got a receipt from this other hotel, as they would definitely start some sort of inquiries. Upon checked out, we were told that we must pay cash and that the receipt they gave us only showed the cost of the room. No hotel name, no phone number... I mean, it could be any receipt from any places. We shared our experiences with other we met in Florence. We found out that this hotel was known to to do this. If you happend to have a room at the hotel, you must consider yourself very lucky. Due to the limited number of rooms they have, they are always overbooked and it is common to redirect customers to other hotels of inferior quality. But when you are travelling, you are not likely to take your luggage and walk around Florence to look for another place. Not the first night. So...beware of such fraudulent and unethical practice. And if you happend to get a psuedo receipt, demand a proper one. It is under Italian law that the receipt for your hotel must show the name of the hotel, not just some paper running from your corner store regiser.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel Only staying at Hotel Bigallo for two nights, we were disappointed we didn't stay longer. The location of the Hotel cannot be beat. Walking with luggage from the train station, we knew the hotel was located by Duomo (making navigation quite easy). We didn't realize that out room windows would open right onto the Duomo! The hotel was clean, very updated and modern, and centrally located. Anna at the reception desk was always ready to answer questions. Although our room was close to the reception, we were never able to hear people - making sleeping delighful. Would definitely make a trip back to Florence and Hotel Bigallo again.

<Content>The BEST location! We based our trip on feedback from other trip advisor comments. It worked out great. Excellent location looking out at the Duomo. We had a hard time finding it as it is in a very small alleyway off the main street. Very clean and well maintained. Front desk help were helpful, but not overly friendly. Only draw back I can think of are the church bells going off at 7:15am (I think) and 8:15am. Did not pose too much of a problem as we wanted to get up and going early. We did not have to pay cash (as noted be other trip advisor post).

<Content>SUPERIOR Location - nice and clean I would definately reccommend this hotel to others. The Location in Florence is fabulous - right in the middle of the town and located literally across from the Duomo (Large church - one of the main attractions in Florence). Make sure to ask for a room with a view (you can email them with this request) because from your window you have a spectacular view of the Duomo and at night it is beautiful. It is a little noisey because you are in the middle of town and you will hear the church bells, etc. BUT they have wood window panels that close completely and block out almost all the noise. Hotel is clean (and I am quite particular), rooms are large, and we paid about $150 Euro a night which was a great deal. The staff is for the most part friendly - some more so than others. They have 24 hour attendant so you can come and go as you please and it is a small hotel. Only beware is that they told us once we got there and were ready to check out that we needed to pay in cash. We worked it out with them but this was not told to us before.All in all, I would suggest you stay here. They even have family/suite rooms which have a little loft area with the master bed and a lower level with a single bed/daybed. We utilized tripadvisor.com for our own booking advice so it is time to return the favor and pass on info to others.Great hotel, great location!

<Content>Great location and value Based on Tripadvisor comments, I booked two nights at the di Lanza Hotel. Upon arrival I was moved to their sister hotel (Bigallo). It exceeded my expectations. Several blocks from the train station. Great location. Faces directly the Duomo. Single room was wonderful. Hardwood floor, marble shower, clean and quiet (not facing main street). Only CNBC in English. Breakfast room was very nice; good selection of cold cuts, cheese, rolls, breads, cereals, fresh fruit and coffee. Great value. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great location. Clean and elegant duplex room I stayed at the hotel Nov. 8 - 10. This hotel far exceeded my expectation. It is right next to the Duomo, just a 10 minute walk from the train station. Our room was a duplex with a queen size bed upstairs and two twin beds on the first floor. The room was elegantly decorated in golden color (curtains, bed spreads, closets, wall). Temperature is electronically controlled. And the best part is that we had a really big window that opens to the view of the Duomo. I have a great picture of the Duomo at dawn. Breakfast was nothing to die for. It is the normal coffee (very watery), cold cuts, rolls, yogurt, juice and fruits. The location is excellent as it is right in the middle of the trendy shops and just a five minute walk to the Uffizi museum. Make sure you stop by piazza di michaelangelo on the mountain. The view is breath-taking.

<Content>Awesome location! Service not great... I only gave the Bigallo 4 out of 5 because of service. It seems a recurring theme. The service by the front desk staff is not horrible, just not overly helpful. Mailing a postcard became a big job. However the location is PERFECT! Literally accross the street from the Duomo. Noise was not a problem at all. We too had a two level room and it worked out pretty well. Breakfast is adequate, but I would definitely stay here again based on the location - less than 10 minute easy walk to anything in Florence.By the way, one of the previous reviews referenced Restaurant Bibo. We also got sent there and it was good and not overly expensive. We arrived without a reservation and the manager or owner (??) apologized for not having a table right away and gave us complimentary glasses of Champagne.

<Content>Great hotel this is our second stay in italy and we have stayed at qiute a few hotels. first look at the size of the rooms you are staying in and the hallways in which they are putting the beds most of the beds in italy are all twins size and then fitted together to make a big bed it is just they way they do things over there I have had very few hotels including some of the four star hotels that have the full size beds. we were a bit shakey at first about his hotle we had just came from a bad experince in siena with a four star hotel that should have been a one star. so this three star hotel we weren't sure of. but I have to say it was one of the better hotels that we stayed at for the location and the view was sectacular. the service well much to be desired we asked for some good resturants and we were told bebo's yuck!! you would think that they would have known some good places we did get screwed with the go thru a tour guide thin for the uffiz but hey we got in they were booked for the prebooking for the next two days we booked it for that afternoon it was expensive but if you like looking at art it is worth it. I myself would have enjoyed a palace or two to look at rather than the paintings. breakfast more like your continental breakfast in the states bread and coffee items not much. every thing is new and clean and the bathroom has a tub and shower. I cannot say enough about the room it had a loft to the bed room area so romantic and the view breathtaking!! the staff wasn't rude just not as helpful as the four and five star hotels that we had been to but for sure not rude!! we stayed in 1404 awsome view with air

<Content>Great location, poor service My husband and I just got back from Italy and stayed here one night while in Florence. The location cannot be beat. However, this is not a service oriented hotel. The staff really is not helpful or very friendly and comes across as rude. They seem to allow some people to use credit cards and others are not allowed to use credit cards. We were in room 1405 which faced the Campanile and Duomo. The room was two levels -- downstairs had a small bathroom and living area with pulloout couch and window with great view. Upstairs was the bedroom -- the bed was a king size composed of two twin beds made uo seperately and then pushed together -- I attempted to remake them together, but they would easily slife apart -- a little attenton to detail here and some customer service would make this a great place to stay. We probably would not stay here again, but would look for somewhere a little more friendly.

<Content>GREAT VIEWS FROM ROOM Very pleased with room, comfy bed, large marble bathroom, very nice furnishings, best thing was view, overlooking Duomo!!. Very central location, ideal for short stay in florence. No problem with noise, except the 7am bells but the double glazing is excellent and you have air conditioning.The only thing to stop me giving 5 stars were the staff. We arrived on a Saturday and ask how we book Museums etc to save us the long queues, reception told us you cannot book tickets on staurdays, and tried to sell as a expensive guided tour of Ulfizi Museum. This is untrue, you can prebook any tickets from any museum, which we did. It saves hours in queuing time, espcially if you have a short time in beautiful Florence.

<Content>Exceeded my Hopes I had a some concerns about picking a nice place to stay in Florence but the Hotel Bigallo exceeded my hopes. Our room was 120 Euro and was perfect. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. Our bed was a very comfortable queen size. The bathroom was large and all marble. Even the shower stall was big, about 3 ft x 5 ft.If you ever see a nice photograph of the Duomo, I suspect it may have been taken through the window of one of the rooms. The location of this hotel is fantastic and the view of the Duomo is phenomenal.Breakfast is a bit sparse with bread, coffee, yogurt, ham, cheese and juice but we found it satisfactory as we did not expect a big spread.The one minor downside is the noise. The price you pay for this location is the street noise. That said, my wife used earplugs which worked great and I really didn't mind the 7 am church bells.Make sure you can get a room with a view of the Duomo and you will not be disappointed with this fine hotel.

<Content>Great Location and Great Staff We stayed at the Bigallo for 6 nights and absolutely loved it. Our double room (120 Euros per night) was huge by italy standards and had a very large bathroom.The staff was very nice and very helpful (especially when I locked our valuables into the safe and then couldn't open it!). The location was amazing - you could almost touch the Duomo from our window, which was very handy for sightseeing and coming back to rest.The location is also a slight downside as (at least in our room) it can be quite noisy on the street below over night and the first bells ring at 7pm. After the first night I used ear plugs and was fine. The breakfast was also a downside, being very scanty.All in all, this was my favourite hotel during our Italy holiday.

<Content>Great Location Stayed two nights 2nd week of May, 2004. Half block from Doumo, perfect location for all activities in Florence. Hotel rates posted by TripAdvisor are out of date. Double room, 190 Euro. Rooms have been remodeled, spacious for Italy including bath with shower only. A 7:00 AM wake-up call is not required because the Doumo's bells peal loudly one half block away. Staff attentive, but not warm, probably due to some not having good command of English. Continental breakfast is Spartan consisting of rolls, juice, cold cuts and coffee. Would stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic Stay Great Location. Great service. We actually stayed at the Hotel de'Lanzi which is around the corner from the Bigallo. The same couple owns both hotels. We were in a triple room that was nice and homey. They helped us back dinner reservations and the recommendations were superb. They helped us arrange side trips to both Pisa and Venice. I am definitely going back and will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Duomo at Your Doorstep Hotel Bigallo was so close to the Duomo that we took better photographs from out our window than we did standing right in front of the cathedral! Our deluxe room with a view also had a great lofted sleeping area and was the most spacious of all the places we visited on our two-week holiday. It was reasonably priced and appeared to have been recently renovated. We would happily recommend it to others.
