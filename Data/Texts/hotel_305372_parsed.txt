<Content>In dire need of a revamp - but the service is impeccable We stayed at the hotel at the beginning of 09 as a family and after the initial shock about the rather tired and worn lobby were pleasantly surprised. We all got nice although worn rooms, everything was very clean and the service in the bar and especially at breakfast was very attentive. In relation to other hotels in Beijung we all got a good deal through a friend - the location is good to for all tourist attractions in the city and the airport can be convienently reached within 40 minutes . If you do not mind it a bit old and you get a good rate give it a try !!

<Content>No good After reading the positive reviews in this website, I booked the hotel thru Sinohotel.com at RMB 600 per night standard room only.We face the same situation as pattiWinnipeg. Upon arrival on Dec 18, lady at reception immediately offer us the Executive Floors for RMB850 with breakfast and we did not pick up the offer. We were given a room on 4/F, number 420. The room was run down especially the toilet and the king mattress, in addition, it is next to a room open to public for herbal spa. I am not sure the condition of their Executive rooms, but the standard room I stayed can only classified as 3 stars. I will not stay in this hotel again.

<Content>"Bait and Switch" We booked the Wangfujing Grand Hotel on the Travelocity website, along with a flight to Beijing. After doing some business in other parts of China, this was our vacation. We chose the Wangfujing Grand because of some positive reviews we had read, and because the price seemed reasonable, and included breakfast (which we heard can be very expensive in China). We arrived in Beijing mid-afternoon and were impressed by the colorful, grand lobby. The front desk is a series of small desks, and we were greeted by an English-speaking, but not extremely warm, young lady. She immediately informed us that we could upgrade our hotel room to the Executive Floors for only 600 RMB ($80) per night. We just laughed and said No thank you. When we asked about the included breakfast, she told us that we did not have that perk with our package. We also could not get the king bed we had requested, but we decided to go see the twin room they had for us. The room was on the 8th floor, was very dingy (although the beds looked crisp and clean), and was very small. We went back down to the lobby, ended up seeing the manager, and were shown to a room on the 13th (Executive) floor, which we eventually negotiated for 500 RMB extra per night (about 50% more than we had planned to spend). The room did include breakfast.Staying on the Executive Floor was wonderful. The room was large, had free internet, and a jetted tub (which came in handy after touring outdoors all day in Beijing's winter climate!) The breakfast lounge was quiet and the food was quite good. We appreciated the lovely Christmas carols playing in the lounge.The hotel was well-located to walk to places of interest. The hotel restaurants were okay, and we found Room Service to be particularly nice!Apart from the first trying 2 hours, I would recommend the Wangfujing Grand Hotel. When you book, be sure that you have all the perks in writing!

<Content>the best hotel for traveling When my boyfriend and i stayed at Wangfujing Grand hotel in beijing China, we really enjoyed the wonderful time. The staffs at this hotel are very helpful, friendly, and have a good command of english. We lived at Room.1435 where can appreciate the amazing view of Forbidden city. And my boyfriend really love the typical chinese food at breakfast buffet. Because we stayed here for five days, they provided us a free beijing one day tour. The great wall is awesome!!!! Overall, it is an excellent hotel and i highly recommand for you.

<Content>Excellent hotel in central Beijing Had an excellent stay at the Wangfujing Grand. At check-in, the clerk asked me if I wanted to stay in an improved room (at a higher rate of course). I declined and was upgraded into an executive suite, which gave me access to the executive lounge and breakfast. The staff at the hotel were excellent, always available and courteous. The hotel is well situated, within walking distance of the forbidden city.Plenty of restaurants in the area.

<Content>Highly reccomended We have recently stayed in Wangfujing hotel and had a really wonderful experience. The got our suitcases to our room, we checked in very quickly, and in general really enjoyed everyone who worked there. The staff is very friendly, courteous and helpful. If they don't know something, they'll find you someone who does.When we checked in, they told us that they upgraded our room. I'm not sure if the actual room was any different, but we now had free breakfast in the morning which was a big bonus since places to eat were hard to find at times in the city.The room was spacious and nicely decorated. The tv had I believe 4 English channels which were just enough to catch up on the news and such. There was a safe in the room and a fridge. Toiletries were provided and included shampoo, body wash, comb, toothpaste and toothbrush, and a shower cap. The rest were in the room but were not complimentary and the prices were clearly written so look before you open something. There was also complimentary water as well as water for purchase.The beds were nice (not too soft but certainly not bad at all), The comforters were great, could have used an extra pillow though.The breakfast we really loved actually. It's not the scrambled eggs and bacon you'd be used to though. They had some foods that you'd never expect to eat first thing in the morning but then you are in China! There is large variety and 2 dining rooms- relax and enjoy.One thing to watch out for: It seemed to us that there were several cab drivers who hung out outside the hotel. They are the ones that get called when guests want to go on a big trip ( the Great Wall in our case). The price is predetermined.. and we were charged 700 yuan (I think you can get less elsewhere) and the cabbie drove us to some factory prior to the great wall. We read a lot about this place and that tourists get taken there but we didn鈥檛 think a cab driver would do this. We got out of the cab and walked in but quickly told the tour guide that we weren't interested. The driver was visibly upset by this and didn鈥檛 say anything to us for the rest of the trip ( we later learned that he gets commission from the factory for each guest or something of that nature). So when this happens just insist that you only want to go to the palce you asked for.. unless you want to see how a vase is made.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay Seven of us went to China recently and this was our first stop. We stayed 3 night, sightseeing during the day with China Travel Service USA. The taxi ride from the airport was harrowing because we didn't have the Hotel name written in Chinese and taxi driver's do NOT read English.The Hotel was a welcome haven: friendly staff, clean rooms, nice breakfast every morning. We were comfortable by Western standards. One of our party did not read the fine print on various toiletries, etc around the room and had to disgorge some items from her suitcase on leaving or pay for them!After a full day of walking and climbing the stairs of Beijing's fabulous historic sites, we appreciated the comfortable beds and quiet of the Wangfujing Grand.

<Content>Good location. Average room and service. Good location in central Beijing - walking distance to the Forbidden City, Wangfujing Shopping District, National Art Gallery, etc. Not very close to Wangfujing Metro but very close to bus and tram stops, also easy to get a taxi.Rooms are a bit old and not very clean. From rooms at higher floors facing southwest you can get a glimpse of the ancient roofs of the Forbidden City - though maybe not worthy of the extra money you pay.

<Content>Average hotel. Good and bad bits. Stayed at the Wangfujing Grand Hotel for 4 nights. Has its positives and negatives. The positives were the staff was very friendly, the location was great, just 5 min walk to the Wangfujing shopping area, and about 20mins to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City and free internet in the room. The bad side was the rooms were a little tiresome, the aircon/heater was noisy and although it was a non-smoking room, at times the scent of tobacco smoke hung around (maybe this is throughout China) . The buffet restaurant in the lobby was expensive. Also the hotel booked us in for a tour of the Great Wall- Unfortunately we left at 8am came back at 5pm and spent just 90 minutes at the great wall and less time at the Ming Tombs, so you can imagine where they took us ( jade factory for one), so I wouldnt recommend the tour suggested by the hotel. Overall if you don't mind putting up with a few nuisances this might be a good choice, otherwise there's a Crown Plaza just across the street.

<Content>Well staffed We stayed 2 nights at first and were pleased enough to book again on our return to Beijing for a 4 night stay. We didn't really experience the bait and switch tactics described by others. We were offerred an upgrade, but the original room we received was cleaner and larger thanmost other hotels I've seen (the room on the second stay was slightly smaller and less nicely decorated but still well above average). It's clearly an old hotel with a nice lobby added more recently to make it more up to date, but I thought the older section was nicely updated and well maintained. We enjoyed the large indoor pool but were a little disappointed that they required a swimming cap which forced me to buy one from them. The work-out facilities were adequate but could have used a bit more variety of equipment. The thing that really stoodout here for me though was the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff. We had left a computer in the taxi when we checked in. While the desk clerk was not really initially helpful, the bell captain immediately tracked it down and had it brought back. My companion, who is a native speaker of Chinese, had simultaneously called the taxicompany himself and was having a lot of difficulty getting them to do anything about the problem. The location was excellent with lots to see on walks around the area.

More than once.But I have felt that robic, run-of -the -mill service from this hotel, Wangfujing Grand Hotel. I'm not the guy on line 2 or in room 809. I actually have a name and interests. I remember i stayed in Wangfujing Grand Hotel serval days ago, and i did my usual morning run. It was early, so i snuck out. But when i returned, here was a gentleman, Nick or other names I did not see clear, from Wangfujing Grand Hotel, standing with a bottle of water for me. It made me a day!

<Content>Not worth the time I stayed for 4 nights in Nov 2007 and couldn`t be happier when I checked out (prepaid the stay). Whilst the bed was clean, I can't say the same for the condition of the carpet in the room, lobby and the dampness smell in the corridor. I had dinner (ala carte) and breakfast at the cafe on the first night and first morning - twice are more than enough !! Lastly, the front desk and maitre d (cafe) is a joke - unprofessional and clueless. Whilst the location is fairly close to the Wangfujing pedestrian mall, there are other better value for money hotels in terms of the condition of the hotel, service and location. Taxis are plenty and cheap in Beijing, but if you want to access the subway, the location of the hotel is inconvenient as the closest subways - Wangfujing or Dengshikou - are at least 15 mins walk and more.

<Content>Old hotel, too expensive for that service I have stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in Nov. 2007. It is an old hotel and you can see it and feel it every time you enter this hotel. I have booked regular room but uppon arrival I have upgraded it for 200 RMB (approx. 30 USD) per night to executive room (computer in room, breakfast and bigger bath room). The rooms and bathrooms are rather small. The rooms are very dark! The breakfast is 'so so'. The location of the hotel is for plus.Next time in Beijing I will pick up another hotel.

<Content>Decent hotel, good location I stayed at the Wangfujing Grand Hotel in October 2007 for 3 nights. The hotel was part of packaged tour, so I think this avoided any of the reservation problems experienced by others. I wasn't too sure what to expect of the hotel, but the room we were given was decent, probably equivalent to a 3-star hotel by North American standards. It looked the room had been refurbished recently; however, it looked like more attention had been paid to certain areas (e.g. linens, bathroom fixtures). There were some spots that were showing their age; for example, the corners of the room were dusty and there was a greyish stain on the bathroom floor and tub. Our tour included breakfast, so we had breakfast at the ground level restaurant every morning. The selection was great, as both Chinese and Western items were available. The location was great as it was within walking distance from the Wangfujing pedestrian shopping area. For those interested in shopping, there's a large shopping mall at the end of the Wangfujing Avenue with many international stores. All in all, it was a decent hotel, but I would probably would have shopped around more for other hotels if I wasn't restricted by the tour.

<Content>Good spot for non smokers In China This hotel had a great location - it was located approx 15min walk to Tian. Sq and the foribidden city and was situated along the main shopping street so very handy.It is VERY hard for non smokers to get any satifaction in terms of hotels in china but this almost did the job for the most part. It had a partial non smoking floor/rooms which is sacred there. The lobby on the other hand was a nightmare. People lit up anywhere but that was throughout.The room was gorgeous - (we upgraded to a superior room) and had great views of the city (we could see the FC!!) and a free desktop with internet access. Decor in the room was tasteful and shower was excellent.Staff were fine.I wouldn't recommend their spa - I went for a message and people were smoking beside you, no privacy and it was done through your clothes!

<Content>Mostly good I stayed at the Wangfufing for 4 nights during a regional business meeting. Generally the hotel has the all amenities you would expect: TV in many languages (CNN  sports channel in English), electronic safe in room, bottled water for brushing teeth, minibar, etc. I had a nice stay, but there were a few things that kept it from being great.The room was pretty clean, but the furniture showed some wear. The internet access is free, but there are some websites that seems to be blocked (for example my company VPN and webmail were both inaccessible). The breakfast buffet was also free with my stay. They have some western foods - cereal, rolls, etc. - but it's mostly Chinese food. This was OK, but it's basically the same food at the lunch buffet. This gets a little boring after a few days, so I recommend getting out of the hotel to eat.The staff is pretty helpful and quite a few people spoke English. A woman at the concierge gave me great advice about walking to the north entrance of the Forbidden City instead of the south entrance where all of the tour groups enter. The hotel is walking distance to a lot of sights and there are some great restaurants, the night market (street food), and interesting shops on some of the side streets nearby. The location really helps the hotel and it seems safe to walk around, at least early in the evening when I was out. The hotel also has an ATM or they will change money for you at the front desk.I wasn't sure what to expect from a hotel in China, but the overall experience was pretty good and I would stay here again if I went to Beijing.

<Content>A very pleasant stay Stayed 7 nights and because I had read of previous reviewers citing problems with std rooms and the 'bait  switch' upgrades to executive rooms I reserved 2 rooms on the Ecutive floor overlooking Forbidden City, just in case. Upon checking in we were offered bigger rooms for an extra 100RMB per night and after inspection of both rooms we agreed to the upgrade. As only 1 bigger room was available on the first night my wife  daughter occupied that room whilst my son  I took the smaller room, with an agreement to move to the larger room the next day.Later that night I was advised that there had been a mistake and the the extra price was 200RMB per night. I decided to not take up the offer of the 2nd bigger room. Was it a 'bs'? Don't know but as over the next 7 days we had no cause for any complaints I put it down to an honest mistake. They do happen!Both rooms were adequate, the bigger having been recently refurbished.Unfortunately, the view of the Forbidden City was very restricted by the 'haze' over the city.We had breakfast in the Executive level room where the food was a mixture of Chinese and Western and was very nice.In all of our dealings with the staff we found them very friendly, courteous and keen to want to attend to our needs. English is only a bit of a problem as there was always someone else on the staff who they could call on if we couldn't communicate. The location was excellent, being right on the main shopping street, the main shopping mall being just a couple of blocks down the road, and within easy walking distance of the Forbidden City.The hotel was recommended by a colleague who had stayed there earlier in the year and like him I was very happy with hotel and had an excellent stay.

<Content>Shady Business Practice I booked a deluxe room in this hotel via asiahotels. for five days. They showed me into a dark, damp, and moldy old room with a bathroom where there was no tub and the shower head hangs directly over the toilet seat. Two of the four lights in the room were broken, the comforter cover smelled of body odor. I complained to the management and they assured me that it was indeed a deluxe room and all of their rooms in this range are similarly equipped. They then showed me a very nice suite on the executive floor and asked if I would prefer an upgrade. I couldn't stand the mildew smell of the deluxe room and accepted the upgrade. The new room could not be booked via the website so I was given no discounts. I ended up paying the full price for the five-day stay. If this isn't the classic bait and switch, I don't know what is. Also, the staff is only friendly to a non-Asian face. I am Chinese, so had quite a few cold glares from them.

<Content>Good Value Among the three hotels I stayed in China in 3 different cities, Wangfujing is the one that I have the least confidence in writing this review because it seems to me the quality of the experience depends heavily on whether you speak Mandarin and wether you are lucky the day you check in. The hotel, according to its staff, is the only hotel in the city that has a view of the forbidden city, which is quite true and the view was fantastic. We were initially assigned to a very smoky room on the 11th floor with a very dirty carpet, then they watned to give us another room that was equally smoky, but slightly cleaner. After a bit of negotiation, the staff decided to upgrade us to the executive level on the 13th floor (14 being the highest), but we had to pay an extra $200 RMB per night, which we gladly accepted beause this room was about 10 times better and much bigger than any of the rooms I had seen, even though it didn't have the view of the Forbidden City, the view was good with morning sunlight. They have a dining room on the 13th floor that's entirely dedicated to the guests on the 13  14 level where you can have breakfast 7-10am, afternoon tea 5-7pm (all included) with a view of the Forbiden City and JingShan Park! So, I highly recommend the excutive rooms. Although, the staff told me the rooms that have the view of the Forbidden City are generally smaller and sometimes can be smoky, so be aware. The house keeping service is a bit random, but generally pretty good and efficient. The location of the hotel is at the top end of the Wngfujing street, so it can take a bit of effort to reach the city center, about 10 mins walk.

<Content>fantastic I found this hotel on the internet and booked direct. Exceptional location, close to shops and main sites (an easy 10 minute walk to Forbidden City and Tian'anmen Square). The staff was friendly and very welcoming. Rooms were big, comfortable and very modern. Try to have breakfast in the hotel as it was great value and offered Chinese food along side western. The hotel arranged taxis for us to the Summer Place (a must) and at half the cost of the 鈥渢rips鈥? Plenty of excellent restaurants near by and not speaking any Chinese language did not cause any difficulty. Lots of pointing and smiling sufficed. No hesitation in recommending and I would stay there again.

The English of some of the staff is not very good but they're patient and willing to help. My wife enjoyed the breakfast, pool and sauna. There was computer with internet access in the room and there appears to be wireless in the lobby but I could never get it to work.

<Content>barely three stars, if that arrived around 7 pm and told that our booked rooms were sold out but that we will be upgraded to the exec floors for our first of 3 nites, comp, and that if we wanted to stay with the upgrade for the 2d and 3d nights, it would cost us an additional $28 or $40, depending on the room. my friend got a jr suite 13th floor with a jacuzzi tub and view of the forbidden city. He happily paid the extra $40 for the next two nights. We got a exec room on the 14th floor, and we would not have paid an extra cent for the room which did not have heat, but did have fleas as well as blankets which smelled of smoke which i had them change (which they did promptly). the bathroom was 4-star, however. The next day we asked to change rooms and were again told that all rooms were booked. We adamantly refused to pay the extra for our exec room and asked to be moved. We also asked if a jr suite were available with the jazuzzi tub for the $40 surcharge and we were told no. At the end, around 10 pm the second evening, we were told we could stay in the flea infested room for no extra charge since no other rooms were available. The whole thing was rather strange, since i did not get the sense at all that the hotel was fully occupied. The elevators were never crowded, and i never saw crowds in the hotel lobby or premises at any time. Perhaps they were undergoing some renovations, as I did see signs of that.As to the facilities themselves, the hotel pool and jacuzzi were located in the basement and were poorly heated. lukewarm, is the best word to describe the jacuzzi. The pool facilitites themselves looked very dated, though they tried to spurce up the trimmings. Yet, it reminded me a bit of YMCA setting-- nothing wrong with that of course, unless you are advertising yourself as a five star facility, which this place was decidedly not. However,the hotel foyer did have an elegant appearance, which perhaps was the sole basis of its high rating That said, a look at the exit stairways from any of the hotel floors will tell you that they are attempting to put a pretty pink dress on what is essentially a pig, but at the end of the day, a pig in a pretty pink dress is still a pig.This 5-star hotel was included in my travel package, but realistically, i would relunctantly pay $80 to $90 for my room (sans fleas of course) for its location and 3-star qualityFinally, the hotel front desk staff was friendly and seemed to try to do its best under whatever circumstances they were operating under. Tips were gladly accepted as they were everywhere else in Beijing by people trying to get theirs in a society seemed destined for economic stratification, once again.

<Content>Truly excellent i am absolutely astonished at the negative things some people have written about this hotel. We were on the executive floor and were very happy with everything; The room was spacious and well equipped including a pc with internet. We actually slept really well on the firm mattress and we had no problem of noise from adjoining rooms. The service was excellent and even the staff with very little english made a huge effort to communicate. As far as the view is concerned, we were lucky because we looked onto the forbidden city. For those of you who have never been to China you have to remember that there are alot of poor people and hence poor housing, so all hotels have some rooms with views that are not what we would hope for. Breakfast was inlcuded on our floor and what we particularly liked is that when we arrived back in the evening after a hard day's visiting and shopping, the 13th floor offered us light snacks and drink s in the comfortable lounge-it was a haven of peace in a crazy city. i am not rich but I am quite well travelled and this is one of the best value hotels I have ever stayed in. i will definitely go back there

<Content>No "western" standard We stayed for six nights at the Wangfujing Grand Hotel, booked through travel agency. At checkin they upgraded our standard rooms to superior rooms at the 9th floor, with view to the forbidden city without any additional cost - very kind! The room was clean, nothing to critisize on the daily room cleaning service. The hotel itself is nicely furnished in chinese style, from the outside it looks like any other modern, faceless building. If you don't like the standard american hotel chains, the Wangfujing is a good choice. As also other reviewers claimed, the walls between the rooms are very thin. The result is, you can hear everything from your neighbours room - voices, doors, shower, TV, even people walking around.The service at breakfast is poor, but not worse than in other chinese hotels we stayed. You have to fight for coffee/tea, small spoons are hard to get and if there is no sugar on the table, nobody takes care about. The location is very good, forbidden city and many shops/hutongs are in walking distance. Hotel Employees are very kind and try to give the best. Chinese organisation is often lacking, so you need to be patient sometimes. Regardless the negative things we would stay again at the Wangfujing.

<Content>I did not like Wangfujing Grand Hotel I stayed at the Wangfujing Grand Hotel in Novermber 2005 as the Crowne Plaza Hotel (where I normally stay) further South on Wangfujing Avenue was closed for renovations (thankfully now re-opened).I did not like Wangfujing Grand Hotel. I stayed for 3 nights but did not get one good night's sleep due to the lack of adequate sound proofing in the rooms. The next door guests were sometimes watching TV or having conversations at 2am in the morning. They were not excessively nosiy but due to the paper thin walls between rooms you could hear everything. In addtion the doors to guest rooms seem to have been designed to slam particulary noisly.I went to the reception at 11pm one evening to ask if I could upgrade to a good room. They told me that my room was a good room, and they had nothing better.This hotel I believe has a 5 star rating. All that appears to mean nowadays in China is that it has a grand foyer. The guest rooms here were not grand in any way.The hotel is off a much lower standard than some of the international hotels in Beijing. I hope never have to stay there again.

<Content>It's 4-star if you fight for it We booked two rooms for 5 nights on the internet at $92 per room per night (not incl breakfast) and were initially put in a moldy room overlooking the rear end of a building, on top of which was actually lying a removed toilet! When i raised hell at the front desk after two nights in these rooms, they upgraded us to the 9th floor, where the rooms were cleaner. Service at the front desk is unfriendly (poor english and poor attitude). The concierge was helpful, but they are in cahoots with the cabs--we got ripped off going to the airport in two cabs, each charging us 150 yuan instead of 100 yuan each.But yes, location is convenient, being at one end of Wangfujing St.So, if you stay here: (1) avoid 3 and 4th floors, stay preferably 8th floor or higher (deluxe rooms), (2) pick your own taxi cabs (3) see if you can get bfast incl in the price, to balance things out.

<Content>Decent Value-for-Money Hotel Stayed here for 3 nights in April 2005 for business in a room on one of the Executive floors. I had requested a room with a Palace view and was given one with no problems. The view was really amazing even taking into account the slight fog that was around at the time.The room in itself was large and spacious although the lighting could have been improved as it did seem to be a bit obscure at times. Broadband connection exists but was extremely slow. Bathroom was clean and fitted with a jacuzzi bath. Breakfast in the executive floors was sufficient although nothing spectacular. I did not go down to the main dining room to try the breakfast there as the view from the Executive Floor lounge was enough to keep me there in spite of the breakfast variety.Price-wise, the hotel is good value for what you get. The staff's English language skills are not great, but I don't think that is something that should turn you away from what is in essense a decent hotel.

<Content>Centrally located hotel, enjoyable stay Stayed here with my wife and parents in September 2004. The higher the floor, the higher quality the room, we understood. We stayed in deluxe rooms on the 8th, where the hall carpet was renewed yet the rooms a bit worn, but clean.The best part of this hotel (apart from price in this hotel category) wasn't the view on the rooftops of the Forbidden City or it's (sufficient) breakfast, but it's central location at the end of Wangfujing shopping street, allowing you easy access to all parts of the city. The same-named metro stop is at the other end of this street, some 15 minutes by foot. Here you can also find Oriental Plaza mall, where the basement is filled with great restaurants that will suit anybody's needs and/or wishes. As for visiting the Great Wall at Simatai: one could ask for a taxi to (Dongzhimen) bus station, where privately operated mini-van drivers try and find passengers for the trip. Count on $40 and a 2.5 hour drive.

<Content>Much More Than I Bargained For This past May, I did what the non-traveler would consider unthinkable. I flew alone to Beijing and stayed by myself for a week. From the moment I arrived, the staff at Wangfujing made me feel extremely welcome. The bellhop brought my bags to my room, showed me around, and twice graciously refused a tip. If he'd taken it, who would've known?? I wondered where the ice machine was located, and a worker in the hall insisted on going to another floor to retrieve the ice for me. Again, no tip wanted.  My room was beautiful, with a window view of the Forbidden City, a round marble bathtub, a robe, and my own slippers. When I unpacked, my dress shirts were wrinkled. Someone picked them up that morning and delivered them back to my room that same day, drycleaned and ready to wear. I felt taken care of every moment.The complimentary breakfast buffet was loaded with American specialties-bacon, sausage, eggs, and vegetables - it kept me full until dinner! As I sipped my morning tea, a hostess would immediately refill my cup-always friendly and smiling.The staff also wrote out landmarks for me in Chinese: Lama Temple, Forbidden City, etc. , so the taxi drivers understood where I wanted to be (I speak ZERO Chinese). The hotel staff placed in front of the building even translated to the taxi when I needed to go to the airport.It is in the perfect Beijing location and easy walking distance to shoppes, restaurants, karaoke, a Catholic church, and the hutong villages. My taxi to the airport cost 100 yuan (13 U.S. dollars). There was a language barrier, but I expected that. Also the gift shoppe and hotel bar were pricey-but it is a 4 star hotel. And it cost me $81.00US a night + tax. How could I possibly complain!I'd stay there again ANYTIME.

<Content>Overall not a good value for money after spending time in Shanghai, we found Beijing to be overall less friendly and more expensive. This hotel was not great value for money, although the room was clean and had all the ammenties of an Western hotel. Nothing special. Your best bet would be to avoid the bar inside the hotel unless you like paying $6 for a can (yes I said can) of Budweiser. Although, it is funny to watch the karaoke and you will feel as though you have walked back into 1985 with all the irridescent palm trees and lights. The staff was also not that friendly or flexible in trying to help you out. There are a few of them who spoke english. We were trying to get a good deal to get out to the Simatai portion of the great wall and they charged us over $100USD to get a taxi out there. They would not help us hire our own (which we knew would be a third of the cost). Really the only redeeming quality about this hotel is its location. You are within walking distance of the main shopping street. Other than that, I might suggest looking around.
