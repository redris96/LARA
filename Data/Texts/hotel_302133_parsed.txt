<Content>First Class Hotel The Shangri La Hotel is conveniently situated for access to the major features in Hong Kong. It is an easy walk to the Nathan Road shopping area as well as being close to the harbour and the ferries to the Island and elsewhere.We booked a standard room as we were only there for a 2 night stay and found it to be well up to the standard you would expect from the Shangri La chain. The view however was of another tall office building but with a bit of a stretch you could also see the boats on the water. No complaints about the facilities in the room.We had not pre-booked breakfast and found it to be vary varied with Chinese, Japanese and European options, but a bit expensive. Had we have found a simple (non-Chinese) breakfast alternative nearby we would probably have opted to take it.Overall a pretty good hotel.

<Content>The best hotel experience so far We have just returned from almost a week stay at hongkong.We stayed at the Kowloon Shangri-La.The hotel is very well located being close to star ferry,Nathan road,the avenue of stars,etc. We were given an excellent room on the 9th floor.The room was very spacious and very well designed.The housekeeping was prompt and what really made our stay special was Chef Ashok .We are fussy about our food and being Indian vegetarians start missing our food after some days.Chef Ashok especially went out of his way to come in early every morning to make us Indian breakfast as we were out for most of the day. The concierge service was also the best we have experienced so far.They were very helpful about guiding us to choose our day tours and shopping along with precise travel tips and choosing the right local transport.The staff was very courteous and friendly. My 13 year old son also enjoyed the temperature controlled pool at the hotel.He would wait to go to the pool as soon as we reached back at the hotel. All in all the Kowloon Shangri-la has been the our best hotel experience so far on our trips abroad.I greatly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Hong-Kong.we will definitely stay only at this hotel on our next visit there.

<Content>most excellent hotel stayed at the shangri la for 5 days. It was perfect - the room was well equiped and the staff were charming and helpful. How they all knew our name was astonishing. Handy for the star ferry and kowloon shopping. We stayed in a Horizon harbour view room - well worth the extra - magnificent view over the harbour and a lovely lounge with coffee, soft drinks and nibbles all day with a happy 2 hours with complementary alcohol and hot snacks in the evening, plus a most excellent complimentary breakfast. All in all couldn't fault it at all and will certainly stay there on our next Hong Kong trip

<Content>good quality hotel for business stayed here for a week during a business trip to HK, having stayed at the sister hotel on the island before I had a certain expectation of shangrila propertiesThe check in was quick and efficient, large immaculate room with welcome tea and fruitgood rate included buffet breakfast which was vast - The kowloon shangrila is usualy avalable at much better rates than island, went to the gym / pool and this is the only downside - the pool is tiny and indoor - where as the island has a fantastic outdoor pool and larger gym, but this wasnt a huge issuestaff were helpful at all time and effieicntly arranged visas and delivered packages etcwould definately stay again

<Content>Lavish yet cozy and efficient We were in HK in October 2008 to attend a family wedding and stayed at the Kowloon Shangri-La primarily because of its proximity to the train station and the shopping malls of Tsim Sha Tsui. The hotel is lavishly decorated. The lobby area has a great atmosphere with music playing lightly, the fountain running, people chatting and drinking at the bar, all against the backdrop of the dramatic views of the HK island skyline.The staff were very efficient and helpful and takes the time to smile and greet you every time they pass you. The rooms were sufficiently large, well air-conditioned (very important in the hot and humid HK weather), very quiet and very nicely decorated - not modern in decor but quite traditional with a sense of warmth and coziness. Our only comment is that a flat screen TV would have made the room perfect as most of other 5 star hotels have them.The bed was extremely comfortable, the pillows gave great support and the linen very soft - just what tired tourists like ourselves needed!!The welcome tea and fruit was very much appreciated - although it would be better if it was provided for each other night of stay......We also had the opportunity to use the gym facilities which was great - they provide light fruit water drinks there and the facilities were modern and well maintained as you would expect.......the only disappointment was the size of the swimming pool which was more like a spa rather than a pool one could do laps.The hotel is also great for anyone who likes gazing at luxury cars - the undercover area just outside the front doors are always parked with about 20 or so cars comprising of Bentleys, Lamborginis, Maseratis, Mercedes, BMWs, Lexuses, Porsches and more!!Overall, we had a great stay at this hotel and our only disappointment was that we had too many family committments and did not spend enough time at the hotel restaurant or bar - we would have loved to try the afternoon tea there but maybe that is something we can try next time when we go back to stay at the Kowloon Shangri-La

<Content>KOOL KOWLOON We stayed at the Shangri La for a 2 night stopover on our way to Australia. The hotel was fabulous and we had booked, as a 10th wedding anniversary treat, a deluxe harbour view room which was just spectacular. The views of the bustling harbour below were out of this world and the room itself was very grand with nice toiletries and little touches that made our stay even more enjoyable. The afternoon tea served in our room was an added bonus. The hotel itself is centrally located for all the usual sight seeing spots and its easy access from the airport. Make sure you get the airport express train from the airport as its quick and cheap. Once you arrive at Kowloon station there is then a free hotel bus shuttle that takes you to the hotel. The staff were always pleasant and happy to assist with any requests and the restaurants in the hotel are also very good. The 2 nights we were there we ate at the Tapas Bar and Angelinis and these were excellent. If you fancy splashing out then head to the Peninsula Hotel and the Felix Bar on the top floor for the best views of the harbour at night and note that every night at 8pm there is a laser show on the waters front which again is impressive. All in all a lovely stay and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit this vibrant city.

<Content>Fantastic hotel for a stopover We stayed at the Shangri-la at the start of our honeymoon, from the moment we stepped in the door we had fantastic customer service. Fresh flowers and an upgraded room made our stay even better.The view from our room was magnificent and the room itself was spacious, modern and 5* standard. The bathroom was a very generous size.We would particularly recommend the Chinese restaurant within the hotel - Shang Palace.The location in Kowloon was extremely convenient both for looking around Kowloon and for the Star Ferry across to Hong Kong Island.Overall, an ideal hotel for a stopover in Hong Kong, we're already planning to go back.

<Content>Excellent Location My sister and I stayed in this hotel in October and loved it! Everything about this hotel is fabulous! When we arrived we were unable to upgrade as the hotel was full, although when we got to our room we didn't need to! The view from the room was amazing. One side looking out over to Hong Kong Island and the looked out to the main road where we could see everyhting that was going on out in the main street. The staff were friendly and would do anything to help. Everytime we got directions from them, they were easy to follow. The hotel is near the subway (which is crowded at peak times!) and there is a que of taxi's right next to the hotel which made getting around so much easier. We ate breakfast in the hotel 2 out of the 3 days we were there (拢30 for the two of us each day!) which was expensive. Although it was delicious and there was everything that you could ask for. The hotel has excellent location; the Avenue Of Stars is across the road and to the right, and Nathan Road is in walking distance. The skies were dull and cloudly, so we didn't make it up Victoria Peak so we'll have to go back!!

<Content>My favourite hotel ever, Value for money My new husband and I stayed here for 2 nights on the way to Australia on our honeymoon. My only regret as that we were not here for longer.We had booked a standard city view room through trailfinders but were given the option to pay for an upgrade to the horizon floor upon check in. We decided to go for this as it included buffet breakfast (gorgeous buffet and cooked to order breakfast in horizon club), access to the club lounge with free drinks (including coctails) and delicious hour deuves between 6pm-8pm. It also meant we got a room on the horizon floor with floor to ceiling windows and the most amazing view of Hong Kong island accross the harbour.It was not a cheap stay by any means but we left feeling we had had an amazing experience and value for money.The room was lovely and had a huge comfortable bed, a massive bathroom with walk in shower and a bath and everything was just really nicely fitted. There was an abundance of quality toiletries (Loccitane) and these were constantly replenished. The bathrobes and slippers were bright white and really soft and fluffy.The thing that really made the stay so nice though was the staff, nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel really special. I was given flowers on arrival (as we were honeymooning I think!), a lovely basket of chinese tea was brought up to our room and a basket of fruit, and one night chocolates were left by the bed. The turn down service was discreet and we were never disturbed and I love how they put a glass and a complimentary bottle of mineral water by the bed each night.The location was excellent, right by the harbour and about a 10 minute walk along the waterfront to the Star Ferry. The entrance to the MTR was also just a couple of minutes away.I just loved this hotel and could go on and on,and it knocked the socks off the Four Seasons which we stayed in in Sydney. I will definately be using other Shangri la hotels in the future.Myself and my husband will always remember sitting in the club lounge watching the city light up whilst sipping cocktails. Thank You Kowloon Shangri La!

<Content>Good location, great service We were there during a typhoon which was a little dissappointing as we didn't get to see much of the city but we sure got to see a lot of the hotel. Location-wise it was not as far from the centre/shopping/ferry as I thought but it's still far if you're walking in the hot, humid conditions.The Food: The buffet lunch was fantastic, probably one of the best I've had in terms of variety and freshness- I think we stayed there hours just eating. The chinese restaurant was also fantastic, the food was delicious but since it's underground it did feel a little dark. The rooms: were very spacious and very clean. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in.The staff: Were willing to help us with anything and everything. The concierge desk was great- they told us where to go for dim sum, shopping, attractions etc. Very helpful. We requested a late checkout and that was not a problem at all!One downside- the beauty salon was very expensive as was a coffee from the lobby.

<Content>Exceeded my high expectations! My husband and I visited Hong Kong for a baby moon the first weekend of June and our stay at the Kowloon Shangri-La was wonderful.As soon as we arrived and barely gotten out of our car ,2 hotel employees greeted us and welcomed us to the hotel. It was as if they knew we were coming. It was a very nice touch that made us feel specialWe upgraded to a harbor view room which was not cheap. It works out to about $100 U.S. dollars extra a night. We were glad we did upgrade though. The view was wonderful to come home to and wake up to each day. The room was very modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The food at the buffet restuarant was very good. The concierge desk was extremely helpful. They got to know my husband and I well and were very patient with all of our questions. The only issue we had with the hotel was during check out. We paid for our rooms through a package and they tried to charge us again for them. We aren't quite sure if this was an accident or not. Just be sure to look over your bill closely. Hong Kong Tips:Tours- We took a city tour the first day and it was helpful. The guide gave helpful information about getting around. Safety tips, food tips, etc. The tour itself wasn't all that great though. If we could have had a sit down with just the tour guide that would have been ideal. So don't bother with the tours. They limit you in regards to time. You might get somewhere and be bored and are stuck until the tour moves on or somewhere great and have to leave to soon. Restaurants:Aqua is an absolute must! It's on the 59th floor and the view is amazing. It's very trendy and the decor is really cool. The food is excellent. It's a mixute of italian and seafood. The prices were pleasantly lower than expected. Museum of Art: Spend your time doing something else. The museum was very nice but the art is quite boring. I come from a family of artists and enjoy going to museums but the Hong Kong one was not great. Shopping:If you live in the Philippines like we do, the night market and other souvenier or knock off markets are no different than those in Greenhills. Except the prices are higher. If you require full fledge designer fashion or accessories, Hong Kong is the place to go. I lost count of how many Luis Vuitton stores I saw.

<Content>Did not miss a beat, exceptional service and great location. I came to Hong Kong on a shopping trip with my mum and we were absolutely thrilled we chose the Shangri-La Kowloon as our home throughout the stay. I highly recommend the club lounge, we upgraded at reception when we checked in and got a fantastic upgrade rate. The service was exceptional and staying on the club floor just made our stay feel really special. Top food  drink and amazing views of HK harbour. This hotel is in a fantastic position and the conceige desk great providing us with maps and recommending some fantastic restaurants to eat at. Overall i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that loves a little luxury.

<Content>Another great Shangri-la Hotel!! Hi, I stayed in Kowloon Shangri-la for one night in Feb 2008. I also used the hotel's conference facilities. It was my first time using the Shangri-la on Kowloon side though I have stayed at the Island Shangri-la a couple of times.Overall, everything was great. The lobby was esp. welcoming. The room itself was spacious and well kept. You can tell that it's not new but it's well maintained.The staff manning the conference rooms we used for our meeting were courteous and prompt with their service.Breakfast was great with variety - both Western and Asian, which is a nice touch.There's a Starbucks literally half a minute away. As usual in HK, you can find lots of restaurants and shops nearby. The hotel is located in the Tsimshatsui EAST area which makes connection to the MTR a very long walk underground. There's an entrance right outside of the hotel but you will find yourself walking underground for about 10 mins before you reach the station, so be prepared!

<Content>hong kong perfection I stayed with my wife at the Shangri La Kowloon for seven nights at the end of March 2008. We booked our trip with Trailfinders who also took care of the flights (We flew with BA World Traveller Plus--very good--we enjoyed the extra room in the seats--well worth considering for long haul) We arrived at the hotel at 6.45pm and were met as we got out of the taxi by a member of the reception staff, taken straight to our room where a member of room service bought us some chinese tea. It was a good start which only got better. All of the staff were extreamly attentive and always gave superb service including the concierge (very knowledgeable) and the waiters. I know that the hotel is 5 stars but in all my years of travel I have never been made to feel more welcome at a hotel. The location is great for getting around Hong Kong--just a few minutes in a Taxi (very cheap) and you could be at any of the markets/shopping areas or you could walk or take the bus. Its only 10 minutes walk to the Star Ferry which takes you over to Hong Kong Island where you can visit the Peak plus some very swanky shopping streets. We had some suits made at Charms Tailors, just across the road from the hotel, great value and quality. The real Hong Kong though is always just off the beaten track and its good to take a day just getting lost (its very safe in HK).Just to sum up The Shangri La is an exceptional hotel, please pay for the upgraded room (deluxe harbour view room) and just enjoy.

<Content>Still a strong contender Stayed two nights in a Harbour View Horizon Club room and the view would have been fantastic if it hadn't been so foggy! The hotel is not the newest anymore, but still maintains a very good standard of decor. The Club facilities are a little limited, although the breakfast selection was excellent (the best corned beef hash and poached eggs I have had in a long while). The staff were friendly and professional, and the limo service was a good addition to make our arrival and departure smooth and problem-free. Ate at Shang Palace for a dim sum lunch one day and was impressed with the standard - and most of the fellow diners were locals which is always a good sign of course. If I were to stay Kowloon-side again I would definitely consider the Shangri-La once again.

The bathrooms though were somewhat inferior to those compared to the Shangri-La in Dehli and felt that they could be updated. They were however, very clean and had excellent supplies. Can also recommend Morton's steak house located in Sheraton Hotel - excellent! Diamond shopping is a must!

<Content>A blast to the senses My holiday of a lifetime was just that thanks to the Horizon Club deluxe Harbour View Room at the Shangri-La. We booked the Mercedes transport and it really set the tone along with the hot tea waiting in our room. We arrived on Christmas Day and as we walked into the beautiful hotel foyer we saw Chinese children perfoming a beautiful nativity pageant, all in costume and a wonderful small girl conducting the choir! We were taken up to the Horizon Club check in and were in our rooms in no time. All staff were absolutely wonderful. It is worth the extra to stay on the top floor as well as the most amazing harbour view, you have the additional facility of free drinks and hors d'hoevres from 6 to 8 pm which were superb. The breakfast was excellent with a choice of continental, cooked meals and fruit served with quality coffee...an excellent start to the day. The room was large with a wonderful wall sized window, electric curtain facility, fresh fruit and a wonderful marble bathroom (with large shower  a flat screen TV!) King sized bed and turn dowm service. Even the mats in the lifts which displayed the day of the week were appreciated as one became befuddled as every sense was blasted by the hotel and Hong Kong's many attractions, not least the jewellery shops! This is one huge experience and whilst some have disparagingly said On yes shoppers paradise, we are not real shoppers and found the temples amazing..a trip to the Big Buddha on Lammas Island is well worth the trip though tey to catch the quicker, more modern boat for a shorter trip; bus trips to Stanley market and the Peak are recommended as is an Octopus card for travelling as you often need the correct money. Try Mannings for having a beautiful suit made in a week (about 拢135) and Prince Jewellery for quality goods and excellent service. I really really really recommend Kowloon Shangri-La.

<Content>Loved the view Loved the Kowloon Shangri-la, they could not be more helpful on our arrival, we caught the airport train to Kowloon Station and a taxi to the hotel, we were met at the door by a very delightful young lady and shown to reception, alas, there was no booking for us, although we had printed confirmation, not a problem, we were immediately shown to our room overlooking the harbour on Floor 18, they confirmed next day with us that the problem had been with them.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed for 7 nights. On leaving the hotel, we caught the shuttle bus which takes you to the Kowloon Station where you check in there, it cuts the queing up at the airport, excellent!

<Content>Much more local flavor than SL Island I stayed here for three nights recently. I thought that it would be a nice change from the SL Island (sister hotel). It was significantly cheaper, over USD 100 less (USD 250) for the same size room. However, it was a cut below in terms of amenities. The TVs are CRT, instead of flat screen. Furnishings are not as nice, etc. Restaurants are decent but also inferior to the Island hotel. The exception is the wine bar, more for the atmosphere, which was vibrant. Service was excellent and I will revisit.

<Content>Very nice great location Spent one night at the Shangri La Kowloon on my way back from the middle east. Great service and great location. Was put on the club floor which is nice as they offer dedicated check in, made to order breakfasts and drinks in the evening. Did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants as they had plenty of snacks and hot hor'deurves in the lounge.Only complaint was that, even though I requested a harbor room they said they did not have one available. Since my company spent a lot of money with their hotel, I thought they would honor my request- but no luck. My room looked out to another office building. Also, I requested a massage and they did not have any appointments available for an in-room and they were expensive. So while out shopping I was approached by a woman hawking massage services on the street and arranged for a massage that way. Was a little nervous about this being on the up and up. But a nice young lady met me in the lobby and came up and performed a great hour massage for a reasonable price. After 6 hours in an airline seat from the middle east-I needed it.Splurged and hired one of the hotel limo's to take me to the a/p the next day. A little over priced at $60-but it was comfortable. Probably would take a cab the next time.

<Content>Shangri la - what else? We stayed at Kowloon Shangri-La for one night beginning of January 2008 on our way home from the Philippines. We had booked a rom with harbour view and must admit that it is quite a view! Hotel is great but sadly we did no have much time to see all features. Service was excellent, quick and efficient; all employee speaking fairly good english (which you do not necessarily find everywhere in HK). The room was excellent, the bathroom magnificent and it included all what can be expected for such a hotel. My wife and daughter enjoyed the indoor swimming pool even if of relatively small size. We tried the japanese restaurant at dinner and it was delightful. The hotel location is very good and practical, especially if you do not have much time to spend. We are definitely recommending this hotel with a little remark that was already made by another reviewer about internet: the room charge is not overpriced if comparison is made with other hotels in that categoy but we believe it should include free internet access. After all, many cheaper hotels around the world anyhow provide free internet access. So, Shangri-La why not your turn?

<Content>Loved it What a great hotel, situated on Kowloon waterfront. We arrived at the airport and got a bus directly to the hotel ( ask at bus desks). I would recommend a taxie as the return journay worked out cheaper. Our room was very large with a kingsize bed. The bathroom was beautiful and the whole room was so nice i did not want to leave. We had a view of both the shops  harbour ( which was beautiful due to the xmas lights). We frequently jumped on the star ferry ( connect to Hong Kong Island) which was 10mins walk away and often ate in the many restaurant just 5 mins walk away from the hotel. This hotel is everything you would expect for a 5 star hotel.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay We were only in Hong Kong for one night so didn't use all the facilities of the Kowloon Shangri-la, but the service was fantastic.  We splurged on a harbour view room; the view wasn't straight-on towards Central but was still lovely. We were on the club floor which was nice mainly for check-in and check-out; also breakfast was great, but the evening cocktail time was rather mobbed and not terribly relaxing.  The room was incredibly spacious, for Hong Kong, and the staff was over-the-top gracious and helpful. I'd stay here again.

<Content>Excellent This was our second stay here and it did not disappoint. We had a superb harbour view room, the view from the Kowloon side is so much more impressive.The room was lovely, everything you could want and the staff helpful and courteous. Breakfasts were great, a huge choice and all nicely presented.We find the location perfect, a quick walk to the Star Ferry or right next to the MTR station.Internet access is free in the lobby area, so I cannot understand the previous reviewers complaint.We love this hotel and would always choose to be on the Kowloon side, we'll certainly be back. We love Hong Kong and feel people often only see it as a quick stopover and see little more than the shopping malls. There are huge areas of national parks with amazing scenery and many islands that have changed little in 100's of years, we enjoyed some lovely hikes where we barely saw another person. I recommend Nov/Dec as the weather is lovely not too humid.I cannot rcommend this hotel highly enough, we've been into others but will be back here next time!

<Content>Does not fit the "Shangri-La" name For the price I paid, I should have paid a little extra and stayed @ the Island Shangri-La in Central. This hotel needs serious remodeling. Looks like a room from 10 years back. The engineer had to come up and fix the lock on my door 2 times in 2 days. Expensive internet. This is my 2nd time at the Kowloon Shangri- La and it's going to be my last.

<Content>Could be so much better This Shangri La has all the infrastructure neccessary to make it a great hotel but none of the charm as we found on a five nght stay here. Our room was very nice, however like a previous reviewer said, smelled strongly of smoke despite being a non-smoking room. The room was well equipped when housekeeping bothered to restock it which was a total lottery. The lobby is typical Shangri La extravagance, fountain and all and is a nice place to unwind at the end of the night with a drink. The tapas bar was very good as was Shang Palace restaurant who do a great dim sum lunch as well as dinner. The hotel itself is well located 5 minutes to the KCR, no more than 10 minutes to the MTR and Nathan Road, you are also right on the promenade where you can witness the nightly light show across the bay. I personally found the staff in general to be apathetic and not particularly helpful when approached which is why I have rated the hotel a 3.

<Content>Great Place! My wife and I had just one night to spend in Hong Kong so we decided to splurge on what looked like a great location.We are so glad that we did! This is a superior operation with excellent facilities. Then, there is also the superior staff that is attentive in every way.We secured an executive room with access to the lounge. With the harbor view (floor to ceiling) in our room, we decided to just stay there and relax while enjoying the fabulous views. Wow!Breakfast in the morning was also superior. Suffice to say, we'd stay there again.

<Content>Top Quality hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights commencing 12th November.We stayed in a standard Horizon room on the 21st floor and even this had a partial harbour view from the bay window.Check in was very efficient, a gentleman called Andrew welcomed us to the hotel and pointed out where the standard checkin was. We explained that we were staying in a Horizon room, he then took a list out of his pocket, checked our names, made a thirty second phone call and immediately took us in a lift to the 20th floor checkin. Everthing was ready and waiting and two minutes later we were shown to our room.The room was large and spacious with a king size double bed that was exceptionably comfortable. The room had a real quality feel about in and included a widescreen LCD TV.All drapes / curtains as well as the air conditioning was controlled by a bedside master control panel.The bathroom was very clean and well stocked with top quality toiletries. All staff were extremely efficient with the right touch of friendliness. The turn down service was also very efficent as staff always seemed to know when guests were out of their rooms.The Horizon club lounges were on two levels which gave a sense of calm in a very hectic city as they never seemed to be overcrowded. The views across to Hong Kong island from both of these rooms were stunning and there cannot be anything much better that sipping a cool beer looking across one of the most famous harbours in the world.Staff in the lounges were superb and nothing was too much trouble, there was a two hour happy hour from 5:30pm when all alcoholic drinks were complimentory and food was also provided.One of the lounges was open 24 hours and soft drinks, tea / coffee and nibbles including free unlimited use of an internet facility was avalable in this lounge.It is always a difficult decision to make as to whether to stay Kowloon side or HK Island side.If you choose Kowloon, then this hotel in my opinion cannot be beaten on cost / location and we would recommend it to anyone..

<Content>so so i'm sure this place is great if you are really spalshing the cash. however the standard room we had was particularly average and in need of updating. we were given single beds without requesting them and were told in no uncertain terms tat we could not be moved. lots of noise from next door too. a little lacking in style which is significant given the density of htels in HK. All in all, if this is your budget i wold lok elsewhere

We had booked a deluxe harbour view room and weren't disappointed with a view from the 18th floor!The room was delightful - we particularly enjoyed breakfast in our room overlooking the harbour and watching the lights at night looking out over the harbour.Concierge were excellent.We ate at both the Shang Place (chinese) and the Italian. Both were excellent but the Italian was equisiteI would thoroughly recommend this hotel

<Content>Good Location We stayed for 2 nights in the Shangri-La Kowloon  booked a standard double room, on arrival we decided to upgrade to a deluxe harbour view. It was expensive for the upgrade but it was well worth it. The views are amazing  the room is spacious  airy. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept it. The bathroom was marble, with a hugh walk in shower  deep bath.The hotel is in a really good location, within walking distance to the Star Ferry to HK Island, the underground, shops, bars  restaurants. I recommend getting an Octopus card to travel around, you buy it from one of the undergrounds  you can use it on ALL transport. You can top up the card or get a refund if you don't spend all the money. It's really cheap, safe  very easy to get around, even taxis are very reasonable.For a drink with an amazing view, I recommend a bar called Aqua, it's about 10 mins walk from the hotel, no 1 Peking Road. it's on the 30th floor, (there is also a restaurant, but I didn't eat here) This place has to have one of the best views in Kowloon. The drinks are a little pricey but the cocktails are the best I've had. Treat yourself.For a day away from HK Island  Kowloon, I recommend Lantau Island with the Big Buddha. It takes about 30/40 by Ferry from HK Island  then a bus ride in the beautiful countryside on steep windy roads with great views. Alternatively the underground train goes there too which is a bit quicker if you don't fancy the ferry.

<Content>Wonderful hotel Myself and my husband stayed at the Shangri La Kowloon for 6 nights at the end of our month long tour of the Far East and Australia in November 07.This was our first time to Hong Kong and we had the most wonderful time. We had booked a Deluxe Harbour View room and were absolutely delighted with the view. We found ourselves getting up during the night just to sit in the huge armchairs and look out across the harbour - it was absolutely amazing.We had breakfast each day in Cafe Kool which has a huge range of different foods, lots of which will be made to order for you. We found the waiting staff very helpful and it was excellent value for money. We often had drinks in the main lobby area and again the service was first class. The location is first class. You are no distance from the MTR, star ferry or the huge amount of shops and restaurants.I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to stay in a 5 star hotel on Kowloon and also you should upgrade to the Harbour view room.

<Content>Pampered feeling Me and my boyfriend are in our twenties and we stayed in Kowloon Shangri-La from May 1 to May 5. So yes, exactly coincides with the golden week of China. Despite the heavy volume the hotel is expecting, we had excellent service. The staff was very helpful and courteous, even if we looked just a split second lost in the lobby deciding on what to do next, a staff would come up and ask if we needed anything. From the doorman to the floor manager. They really take hotel management to a new level. After a long day out sightseeing and shopping, we find a cute wicker basket with a teapot of hot Chinese tea and two cups. These are the little things that really makes our stay special. They treat you like their top priority. It's a warm feeling that you don't get at other hotels... and oh their lobby is much more beautiful than the renowned Pennisula hotel. I don't dare to stay at other places again cuz we had such a great time.

<Content>Loved it!!! Hotel is amazing, would definitely recommend upgrading to a deluxe harbour view room as the view is out of this world! It is in a great location so it's easy to get around and see the sights. Only down fall is the cost of the bars, restaurants and the mini bar. There are lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel though.You can see the light show that takes place on Hong Kong Island from the harbour view rooms but for an even better view take a walk down to the Avenue of the Stars.

<Content>Recommended Hotel In Hong Kong Nice hotel on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong (I typically prefer Hong Kong Island side as its closer to my favorite shopping areas and cool neighborhoods like SoHo). I'm definitely a fan of the Shangri-La chain of hotels. The service is always fantastic and you get a feel for the Asian culture. The rooms are very nice, spacious, and well decorated.The lodging was very reasonable when I stayed there - around $200USD/night - more than worth it!

<Content>Superior in every way We stayed in this hotel on our China tour and it was fabulous. We loved the unusual design of the room -- a sliding arced wood panel with mirrored square insets that gave access to both the closet and the minibar. A mirrored wall in the entry and what a luxurious bathroom! What a comfortable bed! The only disappointment was no flat-screen TV, but who cared? Not us. We were in easy chairs, sipping green tea, peering out our floor-to-ceiling bay window at Victoria Harbor day and night. Service was impeccable, which means instant. We never really got the hang of logistics at the hotel because it was too easy to just pick up the phone: Ice, please. Not only did ice arrive but shortly afterward someone called to ensure that we'd been iced. Security was so great that if you forgot your room key you couldn't tell the elevator to go to your floor. Nice. The restaurants and food were 5-star, like the hotel. The lobby could have won an interior decoration award. If you get a chance to stay here, don't miss it.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel My family and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights mid-April in Superior, River side rooms on our way back from Australia to London. Everything about this hotel was excellent. The rooms, the position, the food, the gym. Absolutely nothing to complain about.We had arranged for the hotel to collect us from the airport. We were met by Shangrai La staff at the exit and escorted to our car with uniformed driver. Despite arriving at 6am, we were shown to our rooms immediately without extra charge.We ate at the hotel a few times, excellent breakfast buffet and excellent lunch and dinner buffet (although lunch and dinner offer exactly the same food, but dinner was much more expensive).This is a highly rated 5* hotel. The other options are The Peninsula and the Intercontinental at this level. It would genuinely be difficult to choose between them.If you are staying at this hotel and are not Shangrai La members, do join. If you become a member you will receive 50% off breakfast and 15% of dinner. Well worth doing as eating here is seriously expensive.We again, arranged for their car to take us back to the airport. I have to say we were looked after from start to end. We'll be back!

<Content>Excellent Hotel and a great location We stayed at the Kowloon Shangri-la for 3 nights en-route to Thailand in a delux harbour view room, which was really worth the extra - the view from the floor to ceiling window is fantastic. We found the room to be modern, very spacious and very comfortable indeed (not as some have said 'tired') the bath was a good size, very deep and there was a large walk in shower. The mini bar was well stocked and the laundry service also was excellent.Breakfast in the Kool Cafe was fantastic with a huge choice on offer, the Shang Palace is also a must - we did also dine at the top of the Oriental Hotel, which was outstanding, and the bar was very cool, however we were very pleased that we had picked the Shangri-la to stay and not on the island, I found this to be a much better location right on the habour front and you can walk along the promanade to the star ferry with great views of Hong Kong on the way.Although the swimming pool is not that huge and was a little cold (although very refeshing after a late night!) the spa itself is very nice with lots of treatments on offer.The service was outstanding both in the hotel and all the restarurants it was a lovely place to enjoy Hong Kong from. I would definitely go back - can't wait!We booked the limo service from the airport to the hotel, well worth the money to arrive in style, you can contact the hotel direct they are very helpful.

<Content>Fabulous view of Hong Kong Island We went to the Kowloon Shangri La for five nights over easter and had the most fantastic time. We booked a Horizon Club room, which had the most amazing views to Hong Kong Island. It also gave us free access to the Horizon Club which was brilliant after a long day sight seeing. The hotel is very luxurious, the rooms very big and had electric curtains, so that you could just press a switch and have the most incredible view.The hotel had very good restaurants in particular the Shang Palace, which did fantastic duck in pancakes.The hotel was ideally situated for shopping and all the night markets, avenue of stars and for the star ferry over to Hong Kong Island. We went over to Hong Kong Island, and up to the peak, but thougt that the Kowloon side of Hong Kong was much better shopping. We would definitely go back to Hong Kong and also back to the Shangri La .

<Content>Excellent Location and sevice I stayed at the Shangrila Kowloon with my parents and partner at the end of April 2006. The hotel has fantastic views of the Hong Kong Harbour from its Harbour view rooms and I have to say it is a lasting memory of my whole far east trip; just lying in bed or lazing in an easy chair watching the liners and junks go past on the sea was superb.We had only been in the room for 10 mins when the door knocked and in came the Manager and his photographer with a cake for my mother and a Shangrila spa polo shirt for my dad ;as I had booked the trip for their birthdays. Since we were really tired after our long flight from Heathrow I wont publise the photos as they arent to pretty but they did send them to me as promised when we got home free of charge.I thought that was an excellent touch.The chinese restaurant in the hotel is rated one of the best in Hong Kong and is frequented by many well to do locals so you dont have to go far to have an excellent meal. The itallian in the hotel is also excellent and has wonderful harbour views.I loved everthing about this hotel the only thing I was disappointed with was that it didnt have an outdoor pool; if that doesn;t bother you and you are happy with an indoor pool then this hotel will not fail to impress you.One thing you need to be aware of which is nothing to do with the hotel was that on the promanade outside the hotel ther were a number of asian men trying to tell you your fourtune.When one has got you talking the other one bumps pass you and steals you wallets so be aware, As I said this has nothing to do with the hotel whatsoever its just some Hong Kong advise.

<Content>Would stay again We stayed at Shangri La Kowloon from 22 - 25 Dec. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very special. We booked the limo transfer from the airport - think it cost approx 拢40. Whisked straight to our room, we actually did check in the room. Chinese tea waiting for us and a bottle of red wine. Service through out our stay was exceptional. We stayed in the Deluxe harbour view room and the views were amazing, full floor to ceiling glass gives you the best possible view. The hotel is in a good location - only a short walk from the shopping area of Nathan Road and a short walk from the Star Ferry to HK Island. We ate at the Shang restaurant one night and had an enjoyable meal. On Xmas day the hotel did a buffet and the choice and quality of food was excellent (much better than the dinner we had at Felix restaurant in the Penisula the night before and half the price). During your stay I would say to go to Victoria Peak. Also go to Lantau Island and take the cable car to Big Buddha  Po Lin Monastery - have the vegetarian meal (about 拢6 including enterance fee to the buddha). Also if you're a fan of sport shoes - you must go to Fa Yuen St, Kowloon - I have never seen so many sports shops in 1 street. This is only a short walk from the goldfish market - which is worth a walk down.

<Content>Best place to stay in Hong Kong We love the Kowloon Shangri-La. We've stayed in quite a number of hotels in Hong Kong - including the Island Shangri-la - but just keep coming back to the Kowloon Shangri-la. It's in a perfect spot - a few minutes walk to the Ferry, and then an amazing Ferry ride into Hong Kong. Best of all - you can see the amazing lights of Hong Kong from the hotel bars. If you are staying in hotel, you might miss the amazing lights that are visible from the Kowloon side. The service in the hotel - like pretty much all Shangr-las - is exceptional. It's worth paying a little extra and staying on the Horizon floor - there's a beautiful lounge with an extra special view across the harbour.

<Content>excellent hotel We have just come back from a 12 night stay at the Shangri La. It met my high expectations of a luxury Shangri La hotel. We had a free upgrade to a harbour view room which had fantastic views. The room itself was large, very comfortable and immaculate. The hotel is well situated only yards away from the station and harbourfront. The only slight drawback was that our room had a connecting door to the room next door. After our first day we queried whether we could change rooms, but there were no n/s harbour view rooms available (though they did offer us a change when a room became available) but we did not find the connecting door to be a problem after the first day. If I returned to Hong Kong I would stay at the same hotel in a harbour view room but would only accept a room without the connecting door.

<Content>Nice hotel - typical 5-star but not exceptional We stayed at the Kowloon Shangri-La for 4 nights as the first part of our honeymoon. We had never stayed in a Shangri-La before but were recommended to stay in this particular hotel because of Shangri-La's reputation and the hotel's location -- particularly for its views. Our travel agent had booked us for a special honeymoon package, where we could have been upgraded to a deluxe Harbour-view room if available, but we opted to pay for a guaranteed view room. This is definitely worth it in my opinion, as I do think there are better hotels in Hong Kong. The hotel is really beautiful and decorated in great taste, however our room had an extremely strong damp, musty smell which was a bit disconcerning. We were brought Chinese tea on arrival as a welcome, and fresh fruit and a bottle of house wine for our honeymoon. This was also greatly appreciated. Service was fine -- as one would expect from a typical 5-star. We ate one night at Shang Palace, which was very good as well.Overall, we had a nice stay. I think if we returned we'd try better hotels on the Hong Kong side, but if you're a first-timer to the city the hotel is great for views and location.

<Content>expected better I booked this hotel because of the excellent tripadvisor reviews, and it was a standard effiicient hotel- good sized rooms and nice breakfast. The tea on arrival was a nice gesture after that no extras, just normal hotel service. The pool as mentioned was tiny and indoor and definitely not a pool to linger in. The carpet was stained. Last time in HK I stayed in Park Lane in Causeway Bay, a much cheaper option. I had hoped this hotel would be a treat to start off our holiday but it was little better than Park Lane. I spent slightly less than 2,000 USD on a weekend in this hotel for 3 of us. The single room had a view of surrounding shops, and the double a side view of the harbour. I did not feel that I had value for money and will not return to this hotel.

<Author>BENLEE123
<Content>Lousy Service at Horizon Club, Poor Value for Money The Horizon Club Rooms ( ie executive floor rooms of Shangri-La Group) in the Kowloon Shangri-La were recently advertised as newly renovated and refurbish, and being quite confident of Shangr-la's standard, and having stayed in their standard room before, I decided to try. So I booked a Horizon Harbour View Club Room which include Horizon Lounge access. I soon come to seriously regret this. First impression when I arrived was already poor. I reached the hotel at 1pm and was informed that my room was not ready since the hotel had full occupancy. I was informed that it will take another hour. Granted the hotel official check-in time is 2PM so I went somewhere else and return one hour later and to my dismay, my room was still not ready. The check-in staff at the Horizon Club made a half-hearted apology and asked me to wait at the lounge while she chased the housekeeping staff to tidy up the room. Finally, the room was ready at 3:30pm. As I paid a top-tier rate for this room in the same range as what I have paid recently for the Four Seasons Hong Kong, I expected to be impressed by it. I was not. The room's decor is the very standard 5-star hotel room, ie carpeted, marble bathroom, slightly larger then normal, working desk, king-bed, the standard stuff. It's all very dull and plain. Furniture and fixtures looks new and functional though but again boring design. They advertise the room as having flat screen TV and surround sound. Well, the TV looks cheap and is only 32 (compare to the usual 42 flatscreen plasma found in most modern hotels). The surround sound is a joke, as the sound comes from a cheap home-theater in-a-box type of setup with such poor sound quality from the small speakers that you might as well just listen to the sound from the TV speakers. For the price they are charging, one should reasonably expect the hotel to invest in a proper sound system if they really want to implement this feature and not put up a gimmick. Next, the poorest aspect of my room, the bathroom. First, you notice the extra-small bath-tub when you step in. Even though I am just an average build asian, I have problem fitting inside it. Then the shower cubicle only have a overhead shower nozzle but no shower stick, highly inconvenient. And worst part is that this bathroom is no different from the bathroom avaliable in standard rooms at a much lower price. Compare that to the luxurious and well equipped bathroom of the Four Seasons, it is simply no comparison. Not everything is bad though. There are some good aspects of this room. The view is reasonably good and there are conveniences in the room such as a Ipod station for playing songs and charging your Ipod and a fax machine/printer. Internet speed is reasonably fast and the sofa chairs are quite comfortable. Well, since the room is only so-so, I thought maybe the lounge will be better. Another big dissapointment. I think the so called lounge area is simply 3 or 4 bedrooms knocked down to form a single room. So the design is longish and worse, they crammed three rows of table across the width of the hallway so there is barely any space left to skretch your legs. Because of the space constraint, during breakfast, there is not enough space to lay out the food presentation so most of the items like eggs, sausages, pancakes etc are in a separate menu which has to be ordered to the kitchen. As a result, the staff at the Horizon lounge wasted a lot of time running in and out of the kitchen area to collect the dishes. Food selection during cock-tail is poor, with only very limited variety. And during evening, because of the small size and close proximity with other tables, it became very crowded and noisy during the evening and lacking privacy. I have seen better and much more spacious executive lounges in other hotels. Even the Shangri-La in Jakarta is better. This lounge looks distinctly four star. The worst aspect of my stay is the service attitude of the Horizon lounge staff. Unlike the Four Seasons where I was greeted warmly by name everywhere I go, I stayed 2 days in the Kowloon Shangri-La and often drop by at the club lounge for drinks and not once was I welcome or greeted by the staff on duty, and of course they can't remember my name. They simply ignore me until I call upon them when I needed something, then they were inconveniently made aware of my existence. But I noticed they were very quick to greet and service the other guests who are caucasians ( ie westerners ). I am very annoyed by this kind of attitude and bias treatment, as if my money is not good enough for them. And it is not just me, I noticed another lady hotel guest who is a asian lady also had problem getting any attention during one of the breakfast session. Not all the staff service attitude are bad. The housekeeping, reception and conciege staff are reasonably good and responsive as expected of a 5-star hotel, but again nothing special or outstanding.It goes without saying that they did not bother to ask me how was my stay when I checked-up. Overall, this hotel is fine if you stay in a standard room and pay under USD250/= which is about the standard rate for a 5-star hotel in Hong Kong and you do not have high expectation. But the Horizon Club room rate is more than double that and at this price, it makes a extremely poor value considering the poor room and lounge facilities and what other 5-star hotels in Hong Kong can offer. Couple that with the indifferent service attitude of the staff at the Horizon floor, especially if you are asian like me, it is best to avoid this hotel completely. How others can rate this hotel as excellent is beyond me, they have certainly not experienced a truely luxurious 5-star hotel or have very low expectations. I will probably not stayed in this hotel again, esp the club rooms. It is just short of being a rip-off for the price.

<Content>The perfect end to a perfect honeymoon on arrival at hongkong airport we were great and taken to our private transfer car which was out of this world. on arrival at the hotel we were greated by a concierge and taken directly to reception to check in where we were greated by the customer relations girl and presented with a posy of flowers and given an up grade in room for our honeymoon. the room was lovely and spacious and the bathroom was just as big as the bedroom almost, the view when we opened the curtains was to die for the harbour was there infront of us in all its splendor. kowloon was a lovely city and the short walk from the hotel to the star ferry was great. the staff at the hotel where excellant and helped you with anything. would most deffinatley return some day.

<Content>Perfection!! I could'nt fault this hotel!! I stayed in a deluxe harbour view room, horizon club level. The view was fantastic!! As I was there over national day celebrations, there was a spectacular fireworks display over the harbour for three nights of my stay, which I could view from the comfort of my room rather than face the throngs of people!! The rooms are spaceous and well fitted, with a fantastic bathroom, complete with plasma TV!! Although I did find the beds a little hard for my taste. The staff cannot be faulted, always welcoming and friendly. I had booked an airport transfer as my flight arrived a late, and being able to step off a plane, be welcomed after customs and wisked to a limosine, was well worth the price. If you can afford it, I would recommend horizon level, the included buffet breakfast, which was a delight, drinks throughout the day and evening cocktails and canapes, in my opinon, make up for the extra cost, and the level of service cannot be beaten. This is a fabulous choice of hotel on Hong Kong, I found the Kowloon side more appealing for tourists, and the hotel is a 5 minute walk along the harbour to the ferry to central, and across the road from a MTR station. Also, the food, room service and restaurants, was of outstanding quality and reasonably priced!! If you're still searching for a hotel in Hong Kong....look no further!!

<Content>Another Great Stay We booked a three night stay in a Harbour View Deluxe room; but upgraded at check in to a View Suite. A pleasant surprise ! We have stayed at this hotel several times; and are always pleased. The staff make this hotel a great one. Clearly, the Shangri La is one of the top 5 hotels in hong kong. Great view of harbour; albiet the views are hampered some by the terrible air polution. Great location to Nathan road. Maybe a 10 minute walk and next to a subway entrance. However, a more critical review of the dining at the hotel is worthy of mention. The Kool cafe's buffet breakfast is overly expensive given the quality of food. Although there is good variety, Western and Oriental, the $55 USD plus 10% service charge is a bit over the top. The chefs still cannot figure out what an 'overeasy' fried egg is...always over cooked. I didn't even contemplate asking for a 'sunny side up' egg!! The pancakes are limp and old looking and the hash browns are the frozen Mcdonalds variety. The Asian selections seem much more appealing. The Sushi restaurant (Nanaman) located on the lower level was most disappointing. Far overpriced and the quality of the sushi is only average. (I eat a lot of Sushi). They have recently reduced the portion to one item; rather than the 2 pieces one usually gets when ordering a la carte. The cost (per 1 item) is $7 to 17 USD each !!Don't bother to waste your money; save your sushi craving when you visit Seattle, San Francisco,New York, Anchorage Alaska or Tokyo.

<Content>Distinctly average Stayed here on a short trip to hong kong. I only stayed one night as we split the trip between 2 hotels. (Other was Langham Place.)I wanted to stay in a hotel which had views over the harbour so we got the Deluxe Harbour View (not Horizon Club).The view was very good, but did not face the most spectacular part of the HKG skyline (opposite the star ferry).Apart from that, the room was nice. We had 2 double beds, CRT TV, DVD, minibar, some chairs......etc.The bathroom had plenty of space, but the design was a bit bland. The same could be said for the decor in the rest of the room......un-inspired would be more apt.We had a nice stay but would not pay the extra money for the view alone. The Langham Place is newer, far more stylish and less money.

<Content>Everything a 5 Star Hotel should be and more I stayed twice in September and have stayed here before. The service is outstanding. The rooms are large and have every comfort. The new bathrooms are excellent. Attention to detail is there. After buzzing around Hong Kong or coming back in from Shenzhen this place is a haven. Try the buffet in the evening. the variety and quality is outstanding. The Chinese Restaurant is also good. It is worth every penny.

<Content>Wondeful View Great location, within walking distance of most Kowloon attractions, shopping and harbour. Previous reports suggest this hotel is too far away from the golden mile. What's a 10 minute walk when you have a superb view of the harbour. The rooms were clean, the staff attentive and the breakfast excellent ( great variety). With 4 or 5 bars/restaurants just around the corner the Shangri La is in an ideal location when staying in Hong Kong. It is not a problem to get to Hong Kong island by either MTR of a enjoyable promenade stroll to the Star Ferry.

<Content>Ideal city hotel if you don't need a outdoor pool There are a lot of positive reviews about this hotel, and I am happy to endorse what has already been written. This is a very good hotel with excellent sized rooms for any city centre, let alone Hong Kong. In particular I want to praise the staff, I only had to look at at staff member to get their attention and a positive response. Harbour view rooms are a must.The only people who may want to consider other options would be those who require an outside pool. The indoor pool was under refurbishment during my stay in August 2006. The hotel is 10 mins walk from the MTR (Metro) and the Star Ferry across to Hong Kong island. In my opion there is no reason for a tourist to prefer a Hong Kong rather than Kowloon 'side' hotel.The buffet restaurant serves a good breakfast and excellent evening meal. It copes very well with with a mix of locals, tour groups and individuals from a wide range of races and nationalities. Don't forget to book for the evening meal - it does get full. The lounge and Tapas bar provide good alternatives at reasonable to high prices. The Japanese and Chinese restaurants are too expensive and much too pretentious, there are better options within walking distance of the hotel.

<Content>VG I can only agree with all the very good reports on this hotel.I stayed with my family in a superb room which had fantastic views. The attention to detail in this hotel is really good. Every night you came back to the curtains closed, the ice bucket full and a couple of bottles of complimentry water. My children loved the way they changed the carpet every day in the lift to match the day of the week. If you want a lovely base for a Hong Kong stay I would recommend it.

<Content>lost horizon.... found we recently stayed for a 4 night stay in 14th floor harbour view deluxe rooms.....welcomed after a 14 hour flight by politeness, efficiency, fresh fruit and pots of chinese tea! Lovely. Staff went out of their way to make everything special and no request was ever done grudgingly........other hotels please note! On my sons 18th birthday got a call from reception enquiring was it Ok for the staff to bring him up a birthday cake............well they did and I am sure other hotels could manage that but the obvious sincerety which went into this gesture was very touching. The fact that 3 gorgeous girls gave him a kiss on his birthday may have helped him forget about being 8,000 miles from home. The lunch and dinner buffets at the hotel are truly superlative in choice abd quality. on our way home we cancelled our 4 night stay in Hotel Intercontinental Hk ( viewed the rooms and they were very small compares with Kowloon Shangri-La) and had another 4 nights in Shangri-La. Best hotel we've ever stayed at and this takes into account NYC, LA, Europe and many others

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed here on the first leg of our Honeymoon and although I was worried that it might be a bit stuffy and more of a businessman's hotel I was taken aback by just how perfect it was.We arrived before 9 in the morning and although check in wasn't until 2 we were given our room which meant we could get some much needed shut eye. The room itself was the best hotel room I have ever stayed in (and I have stayed in 5 star hotels in Europe on business before). The view of the harbour was breathtaking and the facilities and servies second to none. On day to we arrived back from sight seeing to a card, some choclates and a bottle of wine by way of congratulations which was nice. My only gripe would be the food selection, which seemed better at other similar hotels, and the bar opening hours, which went to about 1am. This would normally do me but with the World Cup just kicking off in Asia at that time they could have extended their hours.That said the place was a pleasure to stay in. If I ever stay in Hong Kong again I will be going back to it for sure!

<Content>This was perfect! We recently stayed at the Kowloon Shangri La for several nights during a vacation in Hong Kong. After reading of how small the rooms in most Hong Kong hotels tend to be, we chose this hotel partly for the reviews we read of the room sizes, in addition to amenities. Our experience here was terrific- huge room with an awesome harbor view; great king size bed, excellent bathroom. We were on the Horizon Club which was an upper floor and it included the most amazing breakfast spread that motivated us to pop out of bed each morning to start the day. The service we received was excellent, with friendly, helpful, and attentive staff that we actually got to know as the week progressed.Special concierge services right on our floor made us feel as if they were there to helpjust us with any request no matter how small. This was a perfect oasis in a very hectic city and we hated to check out! We had made prior reservations to move to the Island Shangri La for the remaining nights in Hong Kong, which turned out to be a huge disappointment. If you are considering the Kowloon Shangri La, I say do it- worth every dollar spent, especially for the Horizon Club level.

<Content>Nice hotel, horrible treatment I got my hotel room at a discounted rate on the internet. I was still paying more than $250 a night. When I arrived at the hotel I was treated as if I had been given the room for free. When I asked for a room with a view I was told that since I have such a discounted rate I won't be given one. Instead I was placed in a room on the lowest floor facing an office building, with their windows being separated from my window by no more than 6 feet. I had to keep the blinds closed night and day to avoid people peeking into my room. The room was pretty nice, although it was not clean. One of the bath robes had coffee all over it and smelled like sweat. I am pretty convinced that it hasn't been washed after the previous guest. I am pretty sure that I will never be staying at Shangri-La Kowloon again as they made my trip singnigicantly less enjoyable.

<Content>Best Hotel I have ever stayed in! I normally stay at the Mandarin Oriental when I visit Hong Kong but because the Mandarin is currently under renovation my company booked me into the Kowloon Shangri-La. Well, what a great experience! I never thought the Mandarin Oriental could be beaten but I can honestly say that the Shangri-La did just that.I stay in many hotels around the world due to frequent business travel and the Shangri-La is now top of my list of favourite Hotels around the world. The service is simply exceptional, the rooms are luxurious and spacious and the view of Hong Kong harbour from my room was breathtaking.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I stayed for four nights in April and was very pleased with this hotel. I have stayed in many Hong Kong hotels and never had such a large room. The rooms are very comfortable and luxurious, as well as the marble bathrooms. Excellent showerThe hotel room has many amenities, such as 110 volt current and American type outlets for computer hookup. The rooms also contain a fax machine and printer in the room. The bedding is top quality, in terms of mattress and linens. Excellent lighting in the room for reading and working.Very decent health club with indoor pool, steam and sauna. There are several restaurants, but I prefer to eat outside of the hotel. The location is excellent, just 20 yards from a subway entrance and a five minute walk to Nathan Road, the hotel is on the waterfront overlooking the harbor.The hotel has a high-quality feel, and the staff was very competent. I like the fact that the elevators required a room key to operate, adding to the level of security.I have stayed in several Shangri-La properties and they have all exceeded my expectations.

<Content>A Very Good Hotel My wife and I stayed here for several nights at the end of March 2006. The hotel staff is very friendly and the welcome tea set in the room was a nice touch and very comforting after such a long trip. We had a City View room on the 12th floor. The room was very quiet and reasonably updated. Of course, the hotel is on the Kowloon side of the harbor, so it's a bit removed from all of the attractions in Central Hong Kong. Still, the MTR station is not very far away (it's two stops to Central Station) and it's a nice stroll along the water to the Star Ferry terminal which will take you across to Central.The breakfast buffet is very good as far as hotel buffets go, but it's a bit expensive. If you're looking for something lighter, there's a great Chinese bakery across the street from the hotel that offers delicious baked goods. There's also a very busy Starbucks right down the street for those who need a morning boost. Also, the sushi in the Japanese restaurant in the hotel is excellent.As far as nearby attractions go, Nathan Road (The Golden Mile) is about a 5-10 minute walk away as is the Hong Kong Museum of Art. Enjoy Hong Kong!

<Content>Fantastic hotel We stayed at the Shangri La for 3 weeks, over the Chinese New year. Were picked up in hotel car, greeted at arrival and check in was speedy. Hotel as lovely as the pics on net. we stayed in deluxe harbour view, was amazing view. Didn't tire of looking at the harbour. There is a mini fireworks display at 8pm every night, we we tried to catch.Bathroom was lovely, marble and granite, walk in shower was great! plenty of toiletries, unlimited supply. Turn down in the evenings was nice, poems on pillow. Pool was small but there was only ever one other person there, so felt v private. Jacuzzi also nice. We had complimentary wine and chocs at the w ends. Ten mins walk to underground or star ferry, location was v good. Plenty of reasonably priced and delicious eateries nearby, hence we never ate in the hotel restaurants, which were very pricey. Example a starter in Italian was approximately 拢20, some mains approx 拢50! Was nice to relax in lobby some evenings with bottle of wine, enjoying the harbour view and live music.To summarise, the hotel was lovely (if you had a harbour view room, the rooms overlooking the city could be over a building site), service good (don't expect Thai hospitality), location excellent.

<Content>Almost as good as Island... We stayed at the Kowloon Shangri-La as Island was fully booked. We are a recent convert to the whole Shangri-La experience having thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Island back in March 2005. As we now have Shangri-la membership we thought we would stick with the group. Although Kowloon was not our first choice, we negotiated a very good deal with a City View room on the Horizons floor.The room itself was the standard level room furnished in a classic American Regency style. It has been recently refurbished, though the discerning eye can pick out what has been re-used, such as the bathtub, sink and wardrobe doors. The bathroom did not have the LCD TV, but everything was to the same level of detail and attention and seemed nice and familiar. Forget the view, there wasn't one but that was not our main concern. The plus point was a huge room that accommodated a kingsize bed, sofa and arm chair with room to spare. This was important to us as we were working out of the room for large parts of the day. With free internet, in room fax/copying facilities and free use of lounge and 1 session of the conference room, it made working and meetings so much easier. The free pressing came in handy too.Service wise it was as helpful, friendly and efficient as ever. Express check-in at the lounge was a nice touch as were the complimentary beverages in the lounge. The location itself was OK if not a bit out of the way for us. The hotel does provide free shuttle to the Star Ferry but otherwise it鈥檚 a 10 min walk via Mody Road/Granville Road or the subway to catch the MTR. As we spent most of our time on HK Island, this became a bit of a chore and the taxis journeys became very expensive due to the extra toll charges they added to cross the harbour. This brings me to say that Kowloon is generally more touristy, so things such as taxis generally work out more expensive as they take longer routes. A visit to an optician carrying the official HK tourist emblem also turned out to be a bit of a trap with him trying to sell me all the expensive frames/lenses and bombarding me with the sales talk. In the end I don鈥檛 think I even got the full 30% off as advertised!Food wise it was a bit bare in the immediate area. I can thoroughly recommend the ground floor Thai Restaurant in the Tsim Sha Sui Centre next door (come out the hotel turn right) and also the Shanghainese Restaurant Xiou Nan Guo which is on the 1st level (You can see the diners from the elevated walkway from the hotel). Both serve good quality food at very good prices. Its also worth checking out the numerous Indian Tailors on Mody Road for a made-to-measure suit. A men's wool suit (not designer fabric) should be in the region of around HKD$1500 and take 2-3 days to complete. The hotel also arranged a booking for dinner at the exclusive KEE club, which is a members only affair - food was good with a relaxed dining atmosphere.All in all a lovely relaxed experience, though Island still beats it for quality of service and comfort!

<Content>The Shangri-la delivered the goods We stayed at the Shangri-la Kowloon for three nights end of October on our way to Bali and can honestly say it delivered all that we had hoped it would. We stayed in a Deluxe Harbour View room and the view took our breath away. The ceiling to floor window gave us the most wonderful view of the harbour and we, like other reviewers, sat with a glass of champagne and looked in awe across at the lights of Hong Kong. The room itself was fabulous with the most enormous bed we had ever seen and the bathroom had everything needed for our stay. The staff were professional and welcoming and the hotel although very grand made us feel right at home. We enjoyed a great Halloween night in the Tapas Bar where all the staff had dressed up to really get in the mood! The hotel was also situated within walking distance of the main shopping areas of Kowloon and not far from the Star Ferry terminal for trips to Hong Kong island and the peak etc. Well done Shangri-la!

<Content>Ahhh Shangri-La! Just stayed at the Kowloon Shangri-La for 3 nights. Loved it. The room we booked was a city view but she upgraded us to a deluxe side view harbour which - although it had been a smoking room - they freshened up and was well worth it. The food at the Shangri-La is pretty good as well. We ate in the Lobby a few times and, on our first night, ate at the Chinese restaurant downstairs. The service was really good as were the appointments of the rooms. We also stayed at the Pen, and although that is a more luxurious hotel, the Kowloon shangri-la is not far behind. I think the Shang has better harbour views though as they are completely unobstructed. It also has a great location.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel Every aspect of my stay was excellent at this hotel. Normally I wouldnt choose the Shangrila but opt of another brand, but I can confidently say this establishment is going to the top of my prefered list for Hong Kong.We had a suite with large Bedroom, Sitting Room, Spacious Bathroom and closets galore. The view was the only downer ( A great view of the pedestrian walkway with just a harbour glimpse ) but its Hong Kong so you have to expect something like that considering the Hotels location.I will warn readers about the prices in some of the restaurants, ( A burger, Ceasar Salad, 2 Bowls of Fries and 4 cokes come to a little over $110 Aussie Dollars ) Which whilst good was expensive. However the service is excellent and it lives up to the Shangrila Chains well places reputation. Enjoy Hong Kong!!!!!!

<Content>Fantastic We stayed in this hotel for 3 night before heading to Bali. We have stayed in some very lovely 5 Star hotels, but none as nice as this. We booked a harbour view room, and the views really were fantastic. I stayed awake just watching. It was our anniversary and we were given a 1/2 bottle of Moet, which was great!! We were originally booked into the Mandarine Oriental and we changed our mind at the last minute. We are so glad we did. Not that the Mandarin is not great, but you really can't beat the views or the service of the Shangri La.

<Content>Loved it from start to finish This hotel is the best we've been in. From start to finish the staff were excellent and were genuinely pleased to help you in anyway they could. We were only there 3 days (August 2005) but they remembered our name within no time at all and at breakfast remembered our preferences.The room was out of this world. Huge bed in a huge room (12th floor) with a floor to ceiling window overlooking the harbour. What a fantastic view. The bathroom was simply stunning.Late check-out wasn't a problem. Deadline extended by 4 hours, and then they kept all the luggage secure until we collected it at 8pm, all free of charge.Location is good with all main attractions within walking distance.We'll definitely be back here again one day and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Pricey We stayed in the superior city view room. Good sized room with good standard of furniture. However the view was of a road with a footbridge across!Staff are very polite. Gym has good equipment but the pool is small.Negatives - buffet breakfast is served only until 10:00 a.m. If you go A La Carte, 3 pieces of bread cost 45 dollars! A bit on the expensive side.Buffet breakfast costs 207 HK Dollars.Local phone calls are free, however you have to pay for internet access which is charged at per minute level. You are also charged for paper usage (printing) - seems petty for a 5 star hotelHotel is in good location - about 15 min walk to main shopping area - Nathan Road.Late checking out comes at a cost - so better to time your flights around check out time!

<Content>What a view Stayed in the Kowloon Shangri La on the first part of our Honeymoon, The service was superb, the room was upgraded due to the fact that we where on honeymoon, but we had a harbour view on the 19th Floor. Floor to ceiling window with the view of of Hongkong Island skline, we fell asleep to the view each night. It was stunning and the high point of our trip.The hotel was well located and in walking distance to all the sights . Would highly recommend staying at the Kowloon Shangri la
