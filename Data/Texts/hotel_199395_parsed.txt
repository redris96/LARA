<Content>Christmas Markets trip !! First visit to Berlin so to select such a great location involved a lot of luck, we found the best Christmas market next door, had two brilliant meals withen minutes of the Hotel, the train station is 5 mins away and the Irish Bar with music 7 days a week is a stagger away !Everything about the Hotel is top class, the Staff could'nt be friendlier or more efficent, breakfast had a huge selection and does not finish until 2pm on sundays. The room was spacious and well maintained, the bathroom had seperate shower and bath. Only gripe was nearly getting stung for 10.30euro for a Jameson whiskey in Sams bar in the Hotel when we considered a nightcap although in fairness the prices are well advertised.Would not consider any other Hotel if I was to return to Berlin.

<Content>So relaxing! My stay at this hotel was just outstanding. I was really exhausted from work when I checked in and just wanted to sleep. And that's what I did - nobody bothered me or came near me and I was just left to sleep all night and well into the afternoon the next day. The room (in the newer part of the hotel) was trendy, modern, comfy and luxurious with robes and slippers provided. The bathrooms were huge and well appointed and there were loads of TV channels. There was no mini bar which I thought was a bit odd so I ventured down to the lobby bar which was nice but extremely expensive - there's even a luxurious smoking room with a big TV. The room service menu isn't very extensive but the food was delicious and the service warm and friendly. I really just wanted to hibernate in this hotel as I was tired from a long business trip and I'm so glad I chose this place. Everything you could want is on your doorstep - the location of this hotel is second to none. There's two city centres in Berlin due to the former east/west divide and this hotel is in west Berlin which I found a nicer place to be with more to do.

<Content>Excellent hotel I stayed here for a conference. Room was not ready to check in at 3.00pm. I was asked to return later and was then upgraded to the top floor. My stay was faultless and would certainly be returning when next in Berlin.

<Content>Good hotel but not quite 5-star Just returned from a 4 night package booked through Hotels.com and my impression is of a very good 4-star hotel but not quite 5-star. Nothing too specific but it didn't have that extra something that you expect from 5-star quality. The staff in particular seem desperately to please but don't seem able (or are told not) to think outside the box and go that extra mile that 5-star really requries..Previous reviewers are completely correct that this is a very central hotel and whilst there's Berlin's finest shops on the doorstep, there's little by way of quality bars and restaurants nearby. Indeed the closest restaurant is a KFC.Overall, this isn't a great hotel - but neither is it bad. There's plenty of good reasons to stay here: the rates seem excellent in comparison to other 4  5 star centrally placed hotels; good pool  spa; centrally located;; and others. If they just removed that 5th star that they're clearly very proud of from their logo, I'd be writing a much more favororable review!

<Content>PERFECT! What a lovely place to stay....and for the price....I would say fantastic. The service, facilties, rooms, cleanliness, location, staff, service, food....brilliant. The buffet breakfast is well worth getting up for and taking your time over.Dont be put off by the exterior look...There are better ''five star'' hotels in the world - yes - but for the price and location you cannot fault it at all....well done Palace Hotel!!!TIP - Have a Mojito cocktail in Sam's Bar...the BEST I have ever tasted....

<Content>Palace Hotel is Top Notch Just returned from 1 week at the Palace Hotel Berlin. It was top-notch and deserves the very high rank it receives in the Michelin Guide. When I go back to Berlin, I'll stay there again.Its location, in former West Berlin, is very convenient -- close to subway stops, walking distance to shops (such as the famed KaDeWe department store). Although Potsdamer Platz in former East Berlin is where many new 5-star hotels (including the Ritz Carlton) have located, that area is still very boring, extremely sterile and even desolate in the evening, Not true of the Palace's location. It's even a short walk to the Zoo bus stop where the X9 bus takes you to and from Tegel Airpoprt.In addition, Palace rooms are large and elegant (I had a deluxe double for about $225 a night, including huge buffet breakfast), service is terrific, health club facilities are good. My only quibbles are (1) internet access costs 30 dollars an hour (an outrageous charge) and (2) the only restaurant is a highly-praised gourmet venue whose food may well be great, but whose prices are high (easily $200 per person) and whose atmosphere is stuffily formal. The Palace needs a cafe-like venue where guests can find a wide selection of food at more reasonable prices; the Hilton and Marriott both offer such restaurants.Overall, my suggestion: Stay at the Palace. For the price, for the location, you won't do better in Berlin.

<Content>Never take the first room I met some friends in Berlin and stayed the first night at the Palace Hotel - primarily because it is one of the few central Berlin hotels with a swimming pool.To women travelling alone -- never take the first room you're offered. The Palace was a perfect example of this. I booked one night through Hotels.com (even so, not inexpensive) and they put me in the worst room in the house. Not only was it miniscule and cramped in every way, but it stank of stale cigarrete smoke, dingy, tired and peeling wallpaper - no view, no air. It was gross. I called the front desk and asked to see a different room - and they showed me an out-dated junior-ish suite. At least it was a clean, non-smoking room with some space.Later, my mother-in-law explained to me that they keep rooms like the first one they showed in many European hotels for the hired help - a chauffeur or nanny who may be travelling with a wealthy family. She hypothosized that because I was a single woman, travelling alone and that I had booked online, they assumed that I would be docile or something, and take the first room that I was offered.That said, the swimming pool really was beautiful (though a bit small) - with wonderful scenes painted around it - and the upgraded room a relief - sheets were clean and the room was good enough. Overall, the people were kind, the lobby is fun to sit in, and the experience was ultimately worth the price that I paid for it.Travel Note: I did ask the concierge for dinner recommendation and he sent us off to a restauraunt that was on a back street and had OK German food, but certainly wasn't a winner. Clearly a case of the kickbacks. Kickbacks are fine as long as the restaurant is great or hard to get into. Lesson learned: When staying at the Palace, pick your own restaurant. Don't ask the concierge to do it for you.

<Content>Avoid if possible Stayed here for a conference and would not advise it for people with other options. Room was decent size for a European hotel but there were also many negatives. Furnishings were dated and floors were dirty. The hotel phone system was down for three days. Staff was rude. The front desk tried to charge me an extra day that I had cancelled upon check-in - this was a 30 minute hassle. The location is okay for but for better restaurants and sight-seeing, stay closer to Postdamer Platz or Mitte.

<Content>Perfect location and service minded I stayed 4 nights in the hotel to attend a conference. The first thing which appealed to me is the very central location of the Palace Hotel...it is really in the hart of Berlin (next to the shopping street and next to the parks). This is a huge advantage when one is attending a conference.The hotel is not brand new or very design...but it is not outdated or looking old either. Just say it is not the hippest place in town.The service however is simply perfect; the staff does its best to make your stay an unforgettable event, all of them are so friendly, we really enjoyed this.What I really enjoyed is the breakfast buffet.....a large selection of fresh fruits is part of it...even buttermilk is available. They have different kinds of tea. I looked forward every morning for the breakfast experience in this hotel. (they have a choice of 5 free newspapers 3 German ones and 2 in English at your breakfast table). The SPA was also very nice, they have a finnish sauna next to the iglo room where you can cool down. The swimming pool was nice as well and there's enough space on the SPA terrace to relax and have a drink.They know how make you feel well. As usual in Northern Germany, you can go nude into the sauna and the adjecent public showers (but not at the swimming pool). The temperature of the sauna was 脿 point and the herbs they use gave a pleasant smell. The only minus is that you need to pay an additional 7鈧?to use the sauna (but not the swimming pool, which is for free)Our room was perfectly cleaned up every day. They send in a controller to check the work of the cleaning staff. Again, the staff is very friendlyOur room was very large and spacious, I enjoyed it For me an internet connection is important. They offer wireless and LAN internet...the quality was broadband as well the price...I don't see why one has to pay 88鈧?for a week., I don't need to put coins in the shower even to get it working :(I was very pleased with the overall and outstanding quality of this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel service but with few flaws My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Palace Hotel in Berlin. The location of the hotel is right on Kurf眉rstendamm and very close to the Zoo and Ged盲nknich kirsche.We stayed in one of the renovated rooms after recommendation from Tripadvisor. This was a good recommendation. We had a direct view over the zoo and to the Fernsehturm. The room is modern and has a good size. The beds are rather hard. The hotel has a high standard: There is a good pianoplayer in the bar area at night.The service from the staff is more than excellent. They certainly live up to the standard of The leading hotels of the world. The only minus is the additional costs. Internet Connection is rated to 22 Euros per night which is very high. The prices in the bar are approx. 50% more expensive than in a restaurant. The pool area is fantastic but the pool was rather cold and we therefore only used it once. You have to pay to use the sauna area.

<Content>Outdated The hotel is fairly anonymous from outside. Lobby  bar look very impressive, but a pianist is not to everyones taste! Long narrow corridors and a poorly lit standard room, adequately spacious but very comfortable bed. Furnishings were outdated  looking slightly worn; very poor view. Bathroom was clean but really needs updating (very 1980s). Breakfast was not included but was good  reasonable value at E24. Staff were very friendly  efficient, tho the evening 'turndown' service was a bit unneccesary  ocassionally annoying. All in all not to everyone's taste and expensive for the quality of room. Would not stay again.

<Content>Spotless! We stayed at this hotel because it was near to K'damn and this was our first trip to berlin. We had a standard room on the lower floors overlooking the central courtyard. Probably not the best view if you were staying in mid-winter but perfect in the heat of the summer.The room was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was spacious and immaculate also with the novelty of having a speaker system built in allowing you to listen to the TV while in the bath. A turn down service also added a little more luxury.The spa was great, just what we needed after the hot weather we'd had. Be warned if you are a bit of a prude as most guests are followers of the naked spa regime!Breakfast was fantastic. Everything you could imagine from cereals to freshly made pancakes with maple syrup(recommended).The lobby and cocktail bar were a lovely touch and very relaxing. K'damn is just across the road, as is the Berlin zoo on the opposite side. Both a great day out. Also the tour bus goes from just outside one of the many HMs located on the K'damn.Tiergarten is great for a leisurely wander in the evening. If you're lucky you might just come across a great beer garden near the spanish? embassy which sells pizza and 2 huge litre glasses of beer for 15 euro. Follow the collection of bikes down to this beautiful area by the lake. Once again beware the naked berliners (conservative Irish person speaking) in the park and also the mosquitos!

<Content>Good hotel but surrounding area looking old We stayed for 6 nights. The hotel is well run and very friendly, if a little expensive. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff - try the pillow menu!The Spa on the third floor was excellent.We found Sam's Bar to be very pleasant (although expensive) for a late drink or meal.Breakfast was not included. We tried it a couple of times but it was expensive - however the service was excellent.Our room on the 6th floor was enormous. The decor was a little dated. The bathroom had a bath and separate shower.There were two twin beds connected together to make a double - this was not very comfortable and let the room down, somewhat.The room can get a little noisy if you leave the windows open - but not with the traffic noise, the animals in the famous Zoo, that is close by, get a little boisterous it seems!The Zoo S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations are very close and ideal for central Berlin and for excursions to Wannsee (pronounced Vannzee) and Potsdam (Sans Souci is a World Heritage Site and worth spending at least a day there, but make sure you also visit the Forbidden City where the KGB had their German headquarters).You can walk from the hotel to the very pleasant Tiergarten, although take a one-stop trip on the S-Bahn if you like.Buy a day ticket that covers all travel on the S-Bahn and U-Bahn - although check which areas it covers. You can get week tickets but they end on a Sunday so not of any use to us. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn are excellent.The local area has lost much of its charm since the Wall (and the government handouts) stopped. The Europa Centre which is next to the hotel is one of the earliest shopping centres in Europe and you can tell. We found good restaurants surprisingly difficult to find.Overall a good relaxing stay.

<Content>Standard room bathroom more like 2 star If you go to this hotel don`t book a standard room. The room was ok but the bathroom was tired and in need of refurbishment. The shower was in the bath with the shower head hooked up. This swivelled about when turned on, making it difficult to stand under. There was no thermostat, just a hot and cold mixer tap. I had a nasty fall when the shower suddenly became very hot.I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved this hotel What a nice hotel. Staff is friendly and they speak english fluently. The rooms are very clean and comfy, including beds and pillows. We are a gay couple and felt welcome here. The concierge suggested a boat trip ( a must do when in Berlin) which we loved and a Mozart concert at the Schloss Charlottesburg. The hotel location could not be better. Right In the middle of town a few steps from the U-ban, the Zoo, the Ka-De-We, the Europa Center, and the best shopping area around. Not far from gay mecca either. The breakfast room is amazing and service is impecable. If you can afford it... don't miss it. You are going to love it.

<Content>Pure Luxury We got a great price through Hotelconnect for this 5 star hotel in Berlin, and we stayed from Saturday to the following Thursday morning (the only thing is having to get a VERY early morning flight back to Belfast on Easyjet). The hotel is spotlessly clean, staff are very friendly, and can't do enough for you. We found that they all spoke English, and every member of staff greeted you when passing. We didn't dine in the Michelin starred First Floor restaurant, as a 3 course meal (without drink) was going to be around 250 euro, but would probably be well worth it, we just didn't budget for that!The pool area was lovely, especially after a hard day's shopping!The hotel is situated very close to the Ku'Damm, which is the main shopping area, and there are lots of cafe's from which to people watch.We got room service on two nights, and the food was beautiful (club sandwich with loads of french fries, and a massive burger with fries - how classy!!!)We would recommend dinner at Reinhardt's which is on the right as you walk up the Ku'Damm, part of the Kempinski Hotel - the steak there was out of this world, especially with their 'secret sauce'. Also recommended is Dressler's across the road, and the Wintergarten cafe on the 7th floor of the Ka De We department store. The desserts in this place are unbelieveable - take a look at them on display on the 6th floor food hall too.As for the Palace Hotel, the room we had was on the 9th Floor, and was very quiet. The room was big, the beds very comfy (very comfortable big pillows) and the bathroom was luxurious.To round it off, a big fluffy bathrobe and slippers were just the ticket.We cannot fault this hotel or the staff, and everything was efficient and well organised. The breakfast was fantastic, a large buffet with anything you could possibly want.Would definitely stay here again, well worth 5 Stars!!!!

<Content>Wonderful experience Just back from the Palace today.What a beautiful hotel, with efficient,friendly and helpful staff.We booked a standard room at a great price on the web and were delighted when we arrived to be upgraded to a suite on the 9th floor which you could only get to by using your room key in the lift.This made it really special as the trip was for our 30th wedding anniversary.The hotel is very central(the number 200 bus stops right outside and the Zoo is directly across the street) We flew into Schoenefeld airport and bought a ticket for the train in the newsagents in the arrivals hall.It is about a five minute walk from the airport to the railway station and a 35 minute journey to Zoologischer Garden station,then about a five minute walk to the hotel and costs 2euros 10 cents.Due to our flight time this morning we decided to take a taxi back to the airport,which cost 30 euros.The breakfast in the hotel is amazing,even serving smoked salmon and champagne(if that's to your taste) and it was nice at night to go back to your room to find the bed turned down,the TV turned round to face the bed with the TV guide and remote control on the bedside table and your slippers sitting waiting at the side of the bed.All these little touches make it a very special hotel to stay in.There are so many places to see in Berlin and a long weekend is certainly not long enough-you could spend two days at the shops alone!!Great bargains to be had at this time of year as all the shops have sales-some with 50% reductions.One thing I would avoid is the hop on,hop off city tour.At 20 euros each this was an absolute rip off.Yes you can hop on and off,but if you want to go back to say stop number 2 after you get off at stop number 5,you have to get back on the next bus that comes along to stop number 5 and go all the way round again as the tours only go in one direction which can take nearly 2 hours.It is much easier (and cheaper) to buy a day ticket for 6 euros and jump off and on the number 100 or 200 buses which pass all the sight anyway. Definitely a hotel and city to be recommended-can't wait to go back and see more.

<Content>Excellent central hotel We spent four nights at the Palace in May 2007. It is a very high standard of hotel. We had a superior room booked via the hotel website, with breakfast included, for 鈧?80 per night. The room was spacious and well-equipped, with a kettle and tea/coffee, plenty of wardrope space, separate shower and bath. Service was speedy and exemplary. We dined at the First Floor one evening - it is a great experience, with wonderful tastes to be explored (not cheap, but worth doing once). The hotel is handy for Zoo station, with links across Berlin, and has plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. The spa is OK, but around the corner in Nurmberger Strasse, try the wonderful Thermen am Europa instead - a large roof top spa, with excellent treatments and plenty of space to sunbathe it is about half the price of the Palace spa. There is a friendly, if pricey, late bar at the Palace which is a comfortable place for a nightcap. Overall, we would definitely return to this deservedly five star hotel.

Overall, a very outstanding hotel. I can absolutly recommend this hotel. Very good choice, that you pay and what you get !!1. The location: in the west of Berlin, perfect to travel in the whole city.2. Reception: a very welcome, very friendly.3. Room: very spacy, everything you need is in the room, looked very clean and up-todate.4. Bar: not so big, but felt very well, also very nice staff, looked always after the guests.5. Breakfast: special room that for, very spacy and so much choice, excellent quality.not used: first floor restaurant and spa (you are in Berlin, you are not in a resort hotel, as Berlin has so much to offer).

<Content>Ok so long as you are not expecting 5 star I had a mixed experience in relation to this hotel. Overall found most of the hotel staff to be very responsive  helpful. We also found the location to be very good for sightseeing, shopping, etc as well. I did however find the following to be very disappointing:飦?The bed was very uncomfortable  old飦?The air conditioning was turned off, even though it was cold outside our room was as hot as a sauna. The only option was to have the window open all of the time which made sleeping impossible due to noise from the street below.飦?The bathroom was very dated  disappointing, in particular I could not believe the shower was in a 5 star hotel.飦?Bathroom hairdryer is impossible to style your hair with, it took me 4 calls to the concierge before an alternative was provided.飦?Sometimes the staff on the concierge desk spoke almost no English which was frustrating.I am a very frequent traveller, I would not rate the hotel experience we had as 5 star, something on par with a 3 or 4 star but certainly not 5 star.

<Content>Nice little Hotel I've stayed at quite a few hotels in Berlin and rank this as pretty good. Its very close to the UBaan and S Bann so you can pretty well get anywhere in Berlin from here.The 100 Bus stops just outside the door and will take you to the key sights (Brandenburg gate etc. Buy a day pass as this will make life easier and save you from lugging around a pocket full of coins. If shopping is your thing then its all just moments away. The rooms were clean and big (ish) with the best shower I've ever had in Europe.The only down side is that the bars in the hotel lack any real character or ambience. The Bistro is sometimes a bar sometimes a restaurant and even if there's nobody eating, woe betide you if you just want a drink.....Still all in all excellent value for money.

<Content>Definitely NOT a leading hotel! I have to say I disagree with many of the prior posts...perhaps my standards are different? We stayed for the weekend at the Palace Hotel Berlin. We chose this hotel because of the location (near shopping) and because it is a member of Leading Hotels of the World (LHW). Having stayed at other LHW properties (including the Adlon in Berlin), I'm not sure how the Palace made it into their membership list.If you are looking for a basic business hotel (a la Radisson or Sheraton), then this is probably a good choice. As other reviewers have posted, the rooms are large by European standards, clean and nice, and it is a plus that the bathtub and shower are separate. Convenient transportation is close by, as is shopping. However, this is definitely not a luxury hotel. The amenities (hand soap, mouthwash, shampoo, and body wash were all) are hotel brand, and sickly-sweet smelling to top it off -- not what I'm used to from LHW. We were looking forward to room service our first night, and while it was nicely presented, we were disappointed at the few main course choices on the menu, and they forgot to bring napkins, so we had to use kleenex.We had booked a King Deluxe through the hotel, and our room had two 90x200 beds pushed together to make a king size...not what we expected. To make matters worse, the rooms were very hot, and the air con apparently is turned off for the winter. We couldn't open the window because our window was right next to some equipment (too noisy). Worst of all, the mattress was covered with a plastic liner (for hygenic reasons, we were told), so we sweat all night. Fortunately, the front desk was able to move us to a different room with a regular king bed on a higher floor the second night; sleeping with the window open was a bit more comfortable.Going to Potsdamer Platz one evening, I asked at the front desk (there was no concierge present) for nearby dining suggestions, such as a nice German restaurant. The front desk clerk (who'd been there all weekend), informed me that there were lots of restaurants, but her only suggestion was the chain steakhouse Maredo...not very helpful. She also directed us to the bus stop, but failed to inform us we'd need coins to pay, so we missed the bus while we returned to the hotel for coins.Definitely would not stay here again.

<Content>Nice business hotel I stayed at Palace Hotel for one night on Dec. 20, 2007. I booked via Leading Hotels (130,00 Euro/night incl. breakfast) and as a Leaders Club member I got an upgrade to a superior room (ask for this newly refurbished category). The marble bathroom was not refurbished but quite spacy with seperate tube and shower stall and like the room very clean. Plus:- Prompt doorman service and luggage transfer, quick check-in;- greetings from the management, complimentary fruits and a small bottle of red wine in the room,- turn down service;- good quality room service (excellent club sandwich with french fries for reasonably priced 13,00 Euro, nice arranged with flowers and candle lights);- very friendly and personal wake up-call;- excellent buffet breakfast with a wide variety of hot dishes.Minus:- no atmosphere in the lobby (no guests, no music),- the only dinner restaurant first floor is a very formal gourmet restaurant (one of the best in Berlin) with a high end pricing; the bar didn't offer any snacks just cocktails - so one has to use room service (24 hours) or to step outside the hotel,- at departure the doorman didn't take care for a clean accepable taxi so I had to request another one out of the lane (e.g. the doorman at the Berlin Hyatt take care for a good taxi quality and simply sent the dirty old ones away).In summary a good hotel (mainly for business travellers) with good value for money, ideally located in the city center.

<Content>Vice Nice Hotel, Great Location We stayed at the Palace Hotel during the holiday season. The lobby was so beautifully decorated and we were just mere steps from a fantastic Christmas market. You are a very short walk from some of the best shopping and very close to the U-Bahn/S-Bahn, which made it very easy to get around.The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. The breakfast was absolutely fantastic, though I will have to say the restaurant was a bit dated. Our room was spacious for a European room and the bathroom was very well appointed. Everything is spotless and we had a very nice stay. I would certainly stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Nice, but nothing special This is a nice 5 star hotel, but nothing special. It is not a historical palace or a grand hotel, but just a boring 5 star business hotel. Exterior is extremly ugly, but the rooms are quite nice, although too modern for my taste. Hotel has superb service and very good choice of amenities in the room and bathroom, also the breakfast was excellent.

<Content>Wow!! What a hotel I can honestly say this was the best hotel i have ever stayed in.The service was superb right from the front door. The spa area was great we used the reflexology + sauna + massage + pool- it was all spotless there was never a problem getting towels + toiletries etc. The rooms were immaculate v. well serviced, beds turned down at night, slippers set out + any thing used in the bathroom during the day was replaced.Bathroom spacious, bath with shower + separate shower aswell.Breakfast amazing everything on offer you can think of including sparkling wine ( not the best in the world but v. nice with a drop of freshly squeezed orange juice).Nothing was ever too much trouble for the front desk staff + they were v. good at giving help with directions + various little bits of advice re: transport etc, umbrella on offer if wet to borrow.Location excellant for transport to sights + shopping + eating out lots on offer.I would recommend a day trip to Desdan - trains super + quite resonable, also if time permits a trip to SACHSENHSN concentration camp you can cover the camp in a half day- very very moving. So if I return to Berlin I would definatly stay at the Palace Hotel + would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone.We booked through kudammhotels.com + got the best rate with breakfast included.One other tip we got a taxi from the airport on arrival but from then on we used the s+u bahn + it is so close to the hotel it will save some money.

<Content>Brilliant, loved it, can't wait to go back I wanted a romantic break with my husband, so arranged to leave my children with my mum, and escape to Berlin, so booked a 3 night stay in Hotel palace including flights from Expedia which cost 拢200 pp, so it was a very good price indeed.But as the kids were on their half term, they decided they wouldn't want to stay with their granny and prefer to come with us, so I contacted Expedia to upgrade my reservation, and they wanted to charge me 拢275 for the room only!!!! So I contacted the hotel directly, and they were happy to accommodate them for free! So I only had to pay for their airline tickets. So in case you get in a similar situation just contact the hotel directly.My trip wasn't romantic after all, but the hotel was fantastic, as we were a family of 4, we were given a giant room, with a big bathroom, that has a shower and jaccuzzi tub, the toilet was seperate.I loved everything about the hotel, the staff were very efficient and professional.Don't expect an over the top lobby like in some 5* hotels, but the rooms are fantastic.The spa on the 3rd floor is good, the swimming pool is small and quiet, the changing rooms are very clean, everything about the hotel is clean. You're provided with hotel towels in the swimming pool so don't bother taking yours.The hotel is right in the centre of K'damm, the main shopping area with lots of shops and restaurants, this is my second visit to Germany, and my first to Berlin, but I absolutely loved the Germans and intend to go there every year.The zoo and garden opposite the hotel is a must if you have children, it's nice. Also sightseeing tours is a must also to take you around the main landmarks in Berlin.Don't expect to find bargains in the shops, but the food and drinks is cheaper than England.I would definitely go back to Berlin and stay at Palace hotel again, as I absolutely loved its service and location. If you've booked to stay there, then you've made the best choice.

<Content>Excellent Location and Service Recently stayed at the Palace Hotel for two days in July. The service was excellent in every respect. The location cannot be beat. As I had children in tow being located across the street from the Berlin Zoo entrance was extra appealing. As most of Europe was suffering from an oppressive heat wave, we were able to cool off in the superb indoor pool. Only steps away from the KaDeWe department store, a 10 euro cab ride to Check Point Charlie and 15-20 minutes by cab yto Tegal airport. Every staff member in th hotel went out of the way to be accommodating.5 stars!!!

<Content>A Great Choice in Berlin My fiance and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Berlin Palace during the World Cup games. This was the first visit to Berlin for us both and the Palace helped make it a lovely stay. This hotel is solid and exceeded my expectations.Since we were only flying in for four nights it was essential for us to be able to get good sleep every night and we did. The bed and linens are very comfortable, clean, crisp, soft. The room temperature was under our control all night- very efficient. The room was exceptionally quiet, which was a surprise due to all the people celebrating the games out on the street and square just outside the hotel, we hardly heard a peep the entire time from inside the hotel or outside. The bathroom was wonderful and large for the room, marble every where, good lighting, large mirror, nice tub and shower. The room itself - we were in #825 - wasn't huge but it was big enough with good use of space, good closet/dressing area also. The maid service was superb, the room was kept spotless. The hotel bar was a nice treat, we stopped by 2 nights to enjoy the clubby atmosphere and lovely chanteuse. The breakfast buffet is great, breakfast in Berlin in general is fantastic. When wanting something other than the hotel breakfast we went to Schwartzes Cafe in Charlottenburg, the patio in the back is dreamy and the food and coffee is great, it's about a 10 min walk from the Palace. We loved Berlin, it's a fascinating city in so many ways. There is a lot to see and do in walking distance of the Palace, in addition taxis are right outside and the trains are very near and easy to use as well. Still, we did a ton of walking, with such lovely warm days it was very enjoyable. We took a river boat cruise which the conierge helped facilitate, would definetly do that again. Berlin is a great city to eat and drink in, every meal was delicious, but I have to mention Edd's in the Tiergarten area is superb. It's a little isolated in location but an easy taxi ride and the Thai food is among the best I've had, phenomenal.I strongly recommend the Berlin Palce hotel and look forward to visiting again.

<Content>Great Place to stay We booked the Hotel Palace Berlin after reading many great reviews on Trip Advisor and I have to say we were truely delighted with the hotel - the actual pictures on the their own website do not do it justice... luckily were in the refurbished part of the hotel which was more modern. The hotel staff were very helpful, the hotel is very central - can use Zoolgisher Garten U-bahn and S-Bahn (under and overground) - both are minutes walk away. The spa does cost a little extra but only 7 euro - which is still great value for money as it is lovely. I loved Berlin and will definitely go back to that Hotel...it is great value for money.

The room touches, such as slippers and the bed being turned down was great. Breakfast was unbelieveable, and if you book through the hotel it is included in the room rate. There was every available type of breakfast food, and on a sunday it is available until 2:00pm.The hotel is just by the Zoo ubann station and a lot of the sights are within walking distance. The Palace Hotel is well worth the money!!!

<Content>Centrally located at a good price but why do the spa facilities cost extra? Arrived late at night and had to contact reception twice within minutes of arrival re. room problems, leading to an immediate free upgrade. The original room was OK but outdated whereas the upgrade was much more what I would expect from a 5* hotel.Location of the hotel was excellent, although there was a lot of road and building work going on around the hotel. The swimming pool was nice but we never found the ice room and wondered why it would cost extra for a sauna..surely such a facility should be included in the price in a 5*hotel. So we were a little disappointed as this was one of the reasons for booking the hotel.Breakfast was excellent and included in our room price. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Each night beds were turned down and slippers placed by the side of the bed. Also TV remote control placed by the side of the bed with TV listings magazine left open on the right page with the TV turned around towards the bed.... a very nice touch!!

<Content>Perfect Hotel in a City well worth a visit After much consideration over an ideal base to stay for 3 nights in Berlin I eventually opted for the Palace  was delighted with the choice. Myself  a group of friends shared twin rooms with the intention to explore the main sights of Berlin whilst sampling it's night-life  the hotel complimented a great stay.The location is ideal. Berlin is a large city with it's main area's of interest spread miles apart. This means that there are several different area's that you could use as a base but we were all more than happy with the location of the hotel. Directly across from the ornate entrance of Berlin Zoo on a main road which runs the length of Berlin's main park, the second you walk out of the lobby you know you're at the heart of many points of interest. There's a 2 story shopping mall situated at the base of the hotel although the majority of stores aren't all that great. A simple walk through the mall however brings you to Berlin's main shopping streets which contain large department stores dotted between designer stores  internationally-known chains.The hotel is very plush with piano music often played in the lobby through to a great spa area. A superb ice room is situated in the state-of-the-art spa and pictures of the pool on the net do not it justice. It really is a great facility.The rooms we stayed in were ideal and large enough to accomodate the guests. Bathrobes  slippers were on hand although we did stay in Executive Rooms. Considering that we paid approx 拢80 per room per night we felt that the standard of the hotel for the price was great value for money. Food and drink in Berlin in general was extremely good and well-priced. Plenty of variety in choices for restaurants/cafe's/fast food/bars although we never found any real central area for nightlife.We all agreed that Berlin was a great place to visit  found that it was only when taking a bus-tour that we realised quite how nice much of the architecture was across many square miles as opposed to many cities whose impressive buildings can often be quite concentrated. Whilst the city is certainly not as pleasant to visit as say Munich, it shouldn't put you off a trip if you can get a good deal. It's a different side of Germany which shows old and new to extremes  our 3 night/4 day stay was perfect.

<Content>Good Place in Berlin We just came back from a week's visit to Berlin and had a very good experience at the Palace Hotel. Stayed in one of the beautiful new suites with great views. Hotel is in great location  getting around city from there is a dream. Spa  pool fabulous. Hotel is in last stage of polishing itself since renovations and new management. Gracious, friendly staff, but(because it was January?) the concierge desk was not always manned, and the young front desk staff was not up to the job. (Didn't know how to phone a restaurant if it was not in their computer system, did not know about a place listed in all the English guidebooks, etc.) Biggest complaint is breakfast: 20 euros per person for either room service or large buffet, with nothing in between if you just want coffee and toast. They should include breakfast in room price to avoid problems and leaving a sour note at check-out.

<Content>Lovely Stay We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in late Dec. We had late check in and asked for our beds to be turned down - which they did. Easy to find, polite and helpful. Only downside was the room was a little warm and thermostat didn't work properly. No problem really as the weather was quite bitter outside. Spa and sauna was great - and yes - sauna was nude if you so wish!

<Content>Great Location - Nice Room We were very pleased with the locaion of this hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and shops right near the hotel. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. There are a lot of extra services in this hotel, including an indoor pool, spa, and sauna, although we did not have time to take advantage of any of these. One tip for those who want to take the poor man's city tour of Berlin. Take the 100 or 200 bus, which stops just outside the hotel. This will take you right past a lot of the major sites within the city. For location and service alone, I would definitely stay at this hotel. The only negative is if you book a room without breakfast included, it will set you back 20 Euros to eat there.

<Content>Leading hotel - yes. A leading hotel of the world - not quite. The Palace is member of the 500 leading hotels of the world. to say it in a short way: they try hard to justify that status. As Leaders club members we were offered a category room upgrade from a deLuxe room to a Business suite. so far so good. unfortunately the suites are still in a kind of 80麓s style while most of the deLuxe rooms were renovated this year.Service at front desk wasn麓t as friendly as i expected. Room service on the other hand happened to be excellent.The Palace offers a very good breakfast buffet.

<Content>Palace with kids In general, our experience at the Palace was excellent. We booked on-line through American Express and got the buffet breakfast and a deluxe room for 110 Euros/night, which was a great deal. Staff was friendly and helpful at breakfast. Room staff prepared a roll-away bed and crib for the children each night. Beds were comfortable. Room was quiet and well-equipped. Spa was lovely, except dangerous pool floor, which my 4-year-old took a nasty tumble on. Public transportation connections were excellent, particularly the bus. I headed from Zoo Hauptbahnhof to Freie Universitaet Berlin daily with direct express service. Loads of shopping and restaurant choices nearby, lots of street performers to entertain kids. Very easy to stay for a week with two little ones. Only problem was business services - staff wasn't familiar with computer and printer. Internet access rates were exhorbitant, 25 Euros per day, and tons more if you paid by the day.

<Content>A great choice I chose the Palace hotel after doing quite a bit of research on Berlin Hotels. The time was well invested and I have to report that we were very satisfied with the Palace. It is 5 minutes walk wheeling our bag from Zoo Station, where we came into Berlin from Schoenfeld Airport. The hotel is modern, clean (very) business hotel, but there were some tourists like us as well. Lobby large, sometimes a bit of music, comfortable. Staff are very helpful, attentive, smiling and say hello to you in the morning. Bedroom- we had taken a slight upgrade room on the 5th Floor was spacious, well equipped. bathrooms are really nice marble and glass. So clean and fresh everywhere. They were redecorated in May 05 - so carpets etc. all virtually new. Very nice. Tried the spa- which has everything . Only comment I would make - apart from it being all one would expect, is that I nearly slipped twice on the tile floors around the pool and sauna area- they are dangerous. I was however given some hotel slippers and a robe (after I asked, not on entry). You must use these or risk breaking your leg. Cost was on an excellent deal only EU. 605 for four nights. Which for this hotel was very good value. YOu do have to shop around on the newt to get best deal. I got mine from Bookings, which had the advantage of not taking all your money up front on a no cancel deal (like some of the others try to do...) Hotel is well placed for Shopping, busses and U S Bahn lines. Travel for some distance in Berlin is unavoidable since it is so spread out, that it hardly matters where you stay in the city- but this was particularly central.Just one otherword of advice- and not about the hotel. We travelled back to london on a Saturday evening. Got into Luton at 10.35pm by Easyjet. We arrived at the car part (mid term 5 mins from Terminal) at 12 midnight. Easyjet do not arrange for offloading facilities on a Saturday evening and there were three flights clustered around one very small carousel, hundreds of people jostling and getting angry. Easyjet probably blame groundstaff. Groundstaff couldn't care less. Its Easy's responsibility. Definitely avoid travelling by Easyjet at weekend late evenings! I doubt they have the capacity at that time to run a bath, never mind an airline -with hundreds of passengers wanting to go home and not wanting to wait as long as the flight time from berlin to get to the car park. Angry -yes.But otherwise it was a very interesting four days. Distances in Berlin are vast and the underground or bus often drop you about a half a mile or more from your target destination. Worth a taxi sometimes...One more thing- if you want to visit the Bundestag it is a good idea to book a tour (in english) in advance. That way you avoid the queues and walk right in like an expected guest- free tour excellent. Good areas to eat in the evening is around Hackescher Markt in the Hof complex on Oranienburger Str. and further upo the same street towards the synagogue direction. Lots of good eating places. Best breakfast place we found (but there are many) was in Fasanenstrasse No. 23 (Garden and conservatory part). BUt it is about 15 mins from Hotel. Once or twice is ok. Otherwise there ar places nearer. We didn't take the Hotel breakfast at 20 Eu each. Why so dear??

<Content>Very well equipped room which was spotless, but... The Palace was my home for a week in July/August 2005. The room was well appointed, with flat panel TV and only two English stations (BBC/CNN) unless you wanted to pay a whole lot more for movies. The restaurant and main bar were closed for August, so there was little to eat in the hotel with the exception of a beautiful, but pricey (Euro 20) buffet breakfast. The Concierge, Doorman and a trainee front desk person were very helpful and seemed to want to help. Others at the front desk and the lounge bar were inattentive and cursory in their service. The hotel's main strength is its location--near the very best shopping in the city and the Memorial Church.Other than that, it is a 4-star, not a 5-star hotel. Be aware when you visit Berlin. Berliners seem to be very anxious and angry. They will not be particularly friendly and welcome you with open arms and a hearty laugh.However, if you can get over that, the museums are great, though the lines are long. Berliners are also the best drivers in the world. There is great diversity in the City and not all of it good in that some Berliners don't like other (new) Berliners. Have a good time, the city is safe, then visit Munich--a truly great German city more representative of Germany than Berlin.

<Content>Spa Services Are A Joke Hotel was nice but Hotel Spa was a sham. 39 Euro manicure consisted of 45 minute nail file. Didn't even remove the old nail polish or put new polish on. Said all of that was not part of a manicure. When brought to the attention of the manager, she acknowledged the huge error but refused to reimburse for the charge. Stay at the hotel, but unless you want to pay 39 Euro to get an emory board to your fingernails, don't get a spa treatment. Big waste of money.
