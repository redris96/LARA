<Content>Excellent location for sightseeing We came here for my spouse's conference and got a $130 rate for two. Our room was excellent, with a partial bay view--probably because we are both Gold Passport members. I think the you get what you pay for comment from another reviewer is true; hotels also reward loyalty.The room was fine, on a low floor away from the elevator as per our\profiles. It had a small balcony which (if it were a bit warmer or drier) would be nice to sit on to see the bay and Embaracero area.The honor bar is touch-sensitive but I managed to slide some cheese in on top of the beer. (Note that if you do move something and are charged, if you have not consumed it, you CAN get them to take it off your bill!) The soap and lotion amenities are nice quality and scented with white ginger.Morning coffee is via a small coffeemaker in the room (ugh) or via a $2/cup honor bar in the atrium. That coffee is fine. Breakfast bufffet was perfectly OK but not extraordinary. You are across from the Ferry Building with its food markets, so with a little planning you can get food there to bring back for the morning or just go over there for breakfast.I was a tourist on this trip, so I found the location superb--on the flats for easy walking, close to ferries for scenic rides, a reasonable walk to Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39/the ballpark. It is right at the Embaracadero BART/Muni stop. You can be at Ocean Beach in under half an hour, or at Golden Gate Park. This definitely is my new favorite hotel in SF. And if you see the man with the gray cat on the sidewalk by the bagel place, please help them out!

<Content>Unbelievable! My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for one night last Saturday while we were in San Francisco for a conference.We booked a room at a discount price and the treatment we received at the Hyatt was very bad. They gave us the worst room of the hotel, very small, old, and very different from the other rooms of the hotel (I stayed there other times). For the price I paid, that room was horrible. The toilet was smaller than the closet in the room and very dark. Everything you touch you have to pay. Be careful when you stay there: if you just touch something from the minibar you will be immediately charged for it. And the price are expensive. Better visit the Walgreen in front of the hotel! I don't know if the next step will be charging you money for breathing in the room. Everything I paid was probably for the Christmas decorations in the hall. Terrible! I had better stay at motels!

<Content>Overall great hotel stay I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco for a four day conference. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. The rooms came with small tubes of toothpaste which you business travels know is most helpful. The front desk staff was great as were the bartenders at the main bar. I love my room with a great view of the bay bridge and huge windows that slid open to make it feel like you were outside. The beds were comfortable and the rooms had a nice big flat screen tv. The location is pretty good. A $5 cab ride will take you to North Beach for great pubs and Italian food. Walking distance you will find a few good places at the Ferry Terminal as well as Osha Thai across from the ice skating rink. We walked to China Town for lunch and had wonderful Dim Sum at the Hang Ah Tea Room (kind of a back ally / dive kind of place with GREAT food). I took a cab from the airport to avoid parking costs. The gym was VERY crowded and far too small for a hotel of this size. If you鈥檙e a 24 Hour Fitness member a great club is just a block away. Overall, I would stay here again.

<Content>Highly Recommended Hotel at a Great Location We stayed at this hotel for a few nights and had a very positive experience. The room and bathroom were very large and well-appointed with quality furnishings and products. I needed to purchase a souvenir from the hotel store and would have come back to the hotel late, well after the store closing, and the reception staff arranged to hold the item for me. I really appreciated this.The location of the hotel is very convenient as a base for exploring San Francisco. Should you have a rental car, be forewarned that the hotel and area parking options are quite pricey. There are some terrific restaurants in the area.

<Content>Great hotel but excessive fees Got a great rate via Hotwire for our family vacation to SF. The hotel is very nice - the Embarcadero is a convenient location with shopping, dining, and public transportation nearby. Hotel lobby/atrium is beautiful and has a very impressive Christmas display for the holidays.Housekeeping was great - very responsive when we needed extra towels, etc.The only negative is that the fees for additional services are somewhat excessive, IMHO. When we checked in, the clerk tried to upgrade us to a room with a balcony for only $40 more - when we declined, they tried to get us to join a $75 club to allow us exclusive access into some lounge at the hotel (or something like that). We were just tired and wanted to check in, but it felt like we were buying a used car!Valet parking is $50/night, self parking is $30 (try to get street/meter parking if you can!). There's a minibar in the room with typical exorbitant prices - and it's a computerized one that charges as soon as you remove the food/drink items. So you can't even remove some soda/beer temporarily to use the fridge for your own items. There was a note saying you could call to have the fridge emptied so you can use it - for just a $30 fee!Of course, high-speed internet access is $10/day, which is about average for a high end hotel.Anyway, if I was on business and expensing the parking and fees, I might not care but I thought the fees were a little excessive when paying out of your own pocket!

<Content>Great location to the Wharf!!!! Stayed at the Hyatt for a conference. Since they didn't have a room available for the last day of our stay, they upgraded us to a Deluxe Room which was very nice: great amenities, very clean, flat-screen TV, very comfortable bed. The staff was very helpful and super friendly. Have only one complaint - do not use their WiFi if you don't really have to: in the end it cost $10 more which they do not refund or add into the hotel charge - I hate adding new expenses to my travel reports - just add it into the rool charg.

<Content>Book somewhere else I was booked at this hotel for a conference, so I didn't choose it, and I have to say this is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at in my life. It is the noisiest hotel because all the rooms span off the main foyer where music and events echo throughout the whole hotel and because my room also faced the road the noise from traffic, the buskers and the doormen's whistles is was pretty unbearable. It is also a complete rip-off but because there isn't much to choose from for food in the area except for the day cafes, even on a Saturday night I couldn't find an open pizza restaurant in a 2 mile radius at 7pm. Everything in the hotel is extra cost, for example, to have room service add an additional 20% on top and a $5 gratuity.

<Content>Give it a pass if you're seeking luxury My wife and I (mid-twenties) stayed in this hotel on a Saturday night for a romantic getaway in the city.While the location of the hotel is good, the hotel itself feels jaded. The bathroom is small, and the room is not extra-ordinary. The hotel lobby is alright, but at various places, the walls are not painted, and the hotel gives an unfinished / not-well-maintained look.We were really hoping for a luxurious stay (given our experience at some other Hyatt Regency hotels), but were quite disappointed in the end. We live in the bay area and love the city and plan more getaways, but Hyatt Regency Embarcadero is certainly off our list. If you do decide to stay here:1. Book through Priceline (name your own price) - It goes for as little as $70 a night when the rates on most websites is at best $200.2. Do NOT upgrade to an ocean view room - The view is only partial and hardly spectacular. The way the hotel building is shaped, I doubt there are any rooms at all that provide a clear view of the bay.

<Content>This Hotel is not all it's cracked up to be This is one of the priciest Hotels in the San Francisco Bay area located near Fisherman's Wharf. I thought the hotel would live up to the Hilton name the reason I booked it. The bathrooms are very small and the amenities are old and out of date. There was chipped wood at the counter by the sink and it just wasn't Hilton quality. I paid $215 a night and definitely feel I could have chosen somewhere else cheaper and nicer. Also a friend came by to take me to dinner and left his car for Valet parking while we walked to a nearby restaurant, two hour later he picked up his car for a $57 fee! I feel this hotel is living on it's name alone and needs to kick it up an notch or lower the prices for what it is.

<Content>Great place, great location, great service, high end hotel We loved the hotel for the proximity to everything! Cable car, streetcar, Muni and Bart all stop outside the front door. Close to the water for a walk. Across the street from the Ferry terminal, which houses a number of fantastic restaurants and shops. It is located in a good district, so you feel very safe walking out of the hotel. We checked out the location of several other hotels and were extremely pleased with our choice. We upgraded to the Regency Club level, and it is worth the extra money if you plan to use the benefits. It does not give you that much better of a room, but if you like light breakfasts, mid-afternoon snacks and evening desserts its worth it. We used it two to three times a day and got our money's worth. Hotel food was good. Service was excellent. Only downside was that the room was smaller than anticipated, but having a huge shower, LCD TV and patio doors that actually opened more than made up for it. There was a bit of street noise from the trains early in the morning, but we are early risers anyways.

<Content>Loved the Hyatt Embarcadero My husband an I just returned from a 5 day visit to the Hyatt Embarcadero. He had a meeting there and we came a day early. We loved our room (1623)..it was very clean and had a great veiw of the water. What I really loved was the Regency Club on the top floor. Not only did they have a great continental breakfast and great coffee but snacks throughout the day and a lot of food in the evening. You could eat dinner there- but why would you in SF. The 360 degree view, which includes being blocks from the Bay Bridge was fantastic. The employees were friendly too, not that I had much interaction with anyone besides the RC help and the house keeping staff. I really liked this hotel and the location across from the water and the Ferry Building.

<Content>A potentially good hotel degraded by penny pinching I just finished a five day stay at the Hyatt Regency, for a conference. The location is great, and we had a room with a good view of the bay. the architecture of the atrium continues to impress me. the poor rating is because they seem to have decided to milk guests of every dime possible and minimize expenditure on maintenance.-When I got to the room, I could not get a wireless signal for my laptop. A call to the front desk produced a wireless bridge that did not work ($250 deposit). After standing in the hall with my laptop over the edge of the balcony, I could get a signal usable enough to find they wanted $10 a day for connection!-The elevator call button on out floor was damaged the second day we arrived and was not fixed for the duration of the stay.-The in-room fridge had a sign that if we used it for any of our own stuff it would activate an automatic charge to the room.-The radio is one of those $5 Walmart specials that would not keep tuned into a station without fiddling with it constantly.It is sad to see a potentially good hotel be degraded by an effort to nickle and dime the guest. Just charge another $20, which won't be a big change to a $250 bill, and provide the minimum that Days Inn provides for free.

<Content>Excellent location to base a visit The Hyatt at Embarcadero is an older hotel which has been maintained to a good but not exceptional standard. Its real strength is the location - away from the shambles of Fisherman's Wharf or the night-risky areas near Union Square (the latter is not my view but a statement by authorities as to risk spots while we were there). It has one cable car at its front door, the major bus and tram routes next to that, and an easy walk across to the Ferry Terminal (worth a visit anyway for food stalls and cafes). We upgraded to a Club room which entitled us to (amongst other things) light breakfast on the top floor each day looking out across the Bay - a great spot. Over 3 days we found that this is a perfect base for local touring. Good value at the discounted price we paid.

<Content>Great Overnighter at the Hyatt Regency We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 1 night last December after our long flight from Australia to San Francisco. As we were leaving to head to Yosemite National Park the next morning, our only disappointment was that we were not staying here longer.Initially we were a bit hesitant about the area as we arrived at the hotel on our airport shuttle as there was a very heated argument occuring between 4 intoxicated people over a taxi cab at the entry to the hotel. The concierge, obviously seeing us arrive came out and escorted us through a side entry to avoid the situation happening at the front doors.The foyer area was resplendant with its Christmas displays including minature Christmas scences and hanging interior lights that must have been 11 floors high! It was quite something to see.Check in was prompt, professional and friendly. Our room was modern, clean, spacious and had a fantastic view out to the Bay Bridge. The bed was soft and welcoming and those famed Hyatt pillows are just what us weary travellers required to rest our heads after such a long flight.The hotel is central and within walking distance to everything downtown has to offer (Golden Gate Park is quite a hike though - look for public transport to get there). There is a BART station just a minute down the road, and also easy access to taxis and the Amtrak office (and bus pick up location) at the corner of Embarcadero and Mission Streets.Due to our late arrival we didnt get chance to experience the cafe or bar, but did order full hot breakfast room service the next morning which while quite pricey, but first rate. We booked our room through the hotel's website under the special offers and whilst it would not be considered budget, the quality and location of this hotel would definetely see us staying again.

<Content>Parking Fees are Astronomically Expensive!! We recently booked a two-night stay at the Hyatt Regency, Embarcardero Center, through Hotwire and got what appeared to be a great deal. (We were charged $109 plus tax per night.) When we arrived at the hotel the valet told us (to our horror) that the charge for parking at the hotel was $57 per day! Given that Hotwire does not release the name of the hotel or charges for hotel INCIDENTALS (which apparently parking is considered) prior to paying for the room, we were taken completely by surprise. And given the non-refundable nature of Hotwire bookings, we were stuck paying the $114 to park for two nights.We fully expected to pay around $25/day for parking, but to charge more than half of the cost of the room itself is highway robbery..The hotel was nice enough, but we won't be going back - EVER..

<Content>Nice Hotel I did not find this hotel as bad as some of the comments that were written. I had a great room with a view on the 6th floor that overlooked the ferry building and the bay. I found my room to be very nicely appointed. The bathroom was nice with an outside sink seperate from the toilet and shower. The beds were nice along with the sheets and blanket. The TV was a nice flat screen although, we did not watch a whole lot of it. The location is good and yes, transportation is bountiful right outside the door. The one down side I feel is in the evening all of the little eateries around closed at 4 or 5:00pm. If you wanted a dinner you couldn't pick up a quick bite to eat right outside the hotel. I was told we were in the financial district.And yes, I was there for a convention that had 600 in attendance, so it is a huge convention hotel. I was able to walk easy to catch the Alcatraz boat. Wonderful tour!Which was about about a 15 walk. Overall, Good Experience

<Content>Just OK My husband and I recently stayed at this property for a couple of nights. We have generally liked all of Hyatt's properties throughout the US as the chain provides clean and comfortable rooms with professional staff. The Hyatt Regency SF definitely caters to the business/events traveller and although there were no glaring issues, the overall experience was not that great. The hotel itself is a bit dowdy and dark and needs to be updated. Our room (15th floor) had a nice view of the bay yet one of the sliding glass doors was off its track. The small terrace and the deck furniture were dirty. The bathroom toiletries were pleasant and the towels were ok; the bed and linens were comfortable. Unfortunately the shower's combination water faucet/temperature control knob kept sliding towards the hot setting and needed to be constantly reset to avoid getting scalded. Additonally, we ordered room service for breakfast and it did not arrive until 50 minutes later (we were told 30 minutes when placing the order). Additonally, the requested carafe of coffee was actually a carafe of hot water and upon notifying room service of this mistake, it took an additonal 20 minutes for the coffee to be delivered. The wifi signal and resulting access in the room were extremely spotty (I noticed another reviewer mentioning this may be due to being on a higher floor?) and when we mentioned this during check out, Hyatt kindly credited us the daily fee. Overall, the Hyatt provided a decent enough stay yet compared to other Hyatt properties, this particular hotel is average to below average.

The worst is that there are bed bugs present -- we know this because we heard other couples talking about it at breakfast. Stay away. Definitely don't pay extra for a view room as you may not get it (we did not).

<Content>Always a good stay I have stayed at this Hyatt many times and it is always great. I was in SF on holiday for a long weekend and stayed here. The hotel itself is a little dated (hallways and even the room design), but the beds are updated and the rooms have flat screen tv's. It's always very clean, the staff is very helpful and you can't beat the location. Some rooms have city views and some have bay views, both are fantastic. As I stated before, you can't beat the location. Ferry Building is across the street, walkind distance to North Beach, China town and Union Square. If you don't want to walk, every form of public transportation is right out the front door (cable car, street car, bus, and BART). And it's almost always easy to catch a cab here. Things I have noticed over the times I've stayed here: The higher floors do not get very good reception for wireless internet, so if you plan on using wireless internet request a lower floor. If you have a room facing Market street, if you open your window it can get a little noisy.Overall, it's a great place.

<Content>Awesome experience! With my past Hyatt hotel experiences, this one has by far been the best. I have stayed in the Hyatt @ The Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf and The Hyatt San Francisco Airport. We decided to valet the car with the hotel but from now on I think I will park next door because of the $25 difference. Check-in was a breeze and the hotel had a great feel to it. There was construction right by the check in desk but I had no idea there was until we started to go up the elevators. They have made it look like there is no sign of construction with temporary walls. I am intrigued to see what it looks like when they complete it.I booked the room through Hotwire and was a little skeptical at first but could not have been more pleased. The views we had were amazing! Great pictures of the Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero from our room.The room was normal size but I really liked the furniture placement and bed placement. The bed looked out into the window/balcony?? It does not have windows but has sliding glass doors that open up almost all the way. The one and only thing I didn鈥檛 like about the room was the bathroom setup. Don鈥檛 know what it was but I just was not feelin it. You must go down to Noah鈥檚 Bagels for breakfast when you visit. Great coffee and great bagels! It is basically located at the base of the hotel. There are a string of shops/ cafes along the base.I will definitely be coming back to this hotel!

<Content>wonderful stay All in all we had a great 8 night stay here in august 2008. We booked the Embarcadero suite and had stunning views of ferry building and bay bridge - with superb sunsets... Room was very large, 2 teles plus one tv in the mirror in the bathroom. Nice luxurious bed and plenty of sofa space to stretch out.There is an entrance/exit to the hotel via the embarcadero centre which is worth using. It takes you along raised walkways above the streets which are filled with shops and covered seating areas beneath bamboo trees... lovely place to stop and have a coffee...Service in the hotel was very good, cocktails were great and had a very enjoyable stay...Just a few disappointments:Regency Club was very busy as it was school holidays so didn't have that exclusivefeel - in fact, breakfasts were busiest time and seats difficult to find... Also it could be difficult to get access to either of the two pcs with internet access (no free wifi in the hotel rooms) as they were taken over by the kids and if you did manage to get onto a pc, there would be a queue of kids hovering around waiting for you to vacate... At the quieter times of the season, this would be a great place to hang out .. Breakfasts good, nice light afternoon snacks and evening honesty bar.. However, during school holidays it is quieter to have breakfast in the ground floor restaurant than in the regency club...The fridges in the room have that system whereby the moment you remove something from the fridge it is charged to your room... the fridge has no room for your own stuff (eg milk for your coffee although coffee maker is provided in the room) and to have your minibar fridge emptied of contents costs $40.... so make use of the tea/coffee in the regency club.For such a large hotel with 17 floors of rooms, there are only 5 small lifts ... with no option to use the stairs it can be slow with many people only going one or two floors so progress getting to your room.We had a 15th floor room at the far end of the hotel overlooking the ferry building... this room could be noisy at night as there is a service elevator next to the room which seemed to get unloaded with plates and trolleys during the night ... also there can be some noise carrying up from the street below , especially in the early morning, so unless you like 6am streetnoise waking you up, take some ear plugs...

<Content>Convenient, Affordable, Great View - Hyatt Regency Embarcadero We stayed a single Tuesday night in August. We came to San Francisco to listen to live music, and needed a place to crash after the concert. After parking next door at the Embarcadero #4 next door ($30.00 overnight, no in and out), we walked into and up to the lobby to check in. I believe the hotel valet parking is $54.00 overnight. We had our key in our hands within 8 minutes - very efficient. The room was on the 15th floor and although we were given a King with City View, we had a great view of the Transamerica Pyramid.The hotel is convenient to the Ferry Building, and we hit Hog Island for oysters and wine before going back to our room for a nap before our night out.Taxis are plentiful and we got to the SOMA venue quickly. After our post-club dinner at a late-night restaurant, our taxi quickly took us back. No ride was over $7.We checked out before 7am as we had work at 9am back in Sacramento.We like this hotel because of the convenience to shopping, eating, drinking, dancing, and all of downtown San Francisco.

<Content>Hyatt Embarcadaro We had initially stayed at the JW Marriott and then transferred to this hotel for 4 nights. The staff here was very friendly and accomodating. The bell staff was excellent, the concierges went above and beyond the call of duty in terms of being helpful, the maids were very prompt and efficient and overall we enjoyed our stay. We would highly recommend staying at the Regency Club level....the food, service and amenities were excellent there and well worth the little additional we paid. Our only complaint was related to the room itself. The bathroom is very small and outdated, the bed was not particularly comfortable and the room needed some general upgrading. The staff here is well trained and there to serve, the amenities are good, and the place is very clean. If the room was better we would have given the place 5 stars.

<Content>An A+ for the Hyatt Regency Club! We just spent 2 nights at the Hyatt at the Embarcadero in San Francisco. If you ever see a deal for their Regency Club-take it! For $259 per night we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the Bay Bridge (we were supposed to have a city view on their Regency Club floor). Your room card goes in a special slot in the elevator taking you to the private 18th floor. This Regency Club included an extensive continental breakfast (bagels, lox, cream cheese, oatmeal, cereals, crossionts, etc.) Later there are mid-day snacks: cookies, fruits, warmed mixed nuts, and beverages. At 5 they serve appetizers-artisan cheeses, meats, olives, roasted vegatables, with a taco bar one night, and baked salmon and clam chowder the next. At 8 there are cakes and cookies. Beverages (non alcoholic) are available at all times. This comes with a fantastic view of the bay! We only had to purchase a small lunch one day. Not only is the food plentiful, it is top quality. The staff is gracious and helpful at the Regency Club and elsewhere. A Hyatt Employee stopped to ask if we needed help when we looked confused (we were!). We give this hotel an A+. Unfortunately, they have spoiled us forever after this experience. Our deal was called committment/celebrate. Do NOT hestitate to take this if you see it! Things to do: a street car takes you right to Pier 39 and the Ferry Building (with an amazing Saturday Farmer's Market) is right across the street.

<Content>Regency Club Rocks Hyatt Regency San Francisco is taking the elite club scene to the next level鈥? literally. While staying at the property, I discovered that the hotel鈥檚 former revolving restaurant Equinox was recently turned into the prestigious Regency Club Floor and Lounge. The top two floors of the hotel now cater to those looking for a chic and exclusive San Francisco experience. The Regency Club Lounge is divided into four hemispheres: dining, business, entertainment and relaxation and is a safe haven for those who want to unwind and rejuvenate in a private, club-like setting.  My favorite space is the entertainment hemisphere, with large plasma TVs; iPod listening stations; lifestyle and business magazines; and Cranium board games. I also enjoyed the relaxation hemisphere, which is perfect for travelers like me who just need a quiet retreat at the end of the day and a place to enjoy the spectacular panoramic views. Aside from all the amenities, I enjoyed the dining hemisphere, which never stops serving delicious meals (for breakfast, lunch and dinner), snacks and appetizers. The lounge was also a great place to meet up with a few colleagues, where we could chat in private, take in the amazing scenery and nosh on some of our favorite munchies! In this great city of options, Hyatt Regency鈥檚 new club floor and lounge has me hooked!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! Don't rent a car! This hotel was even more than we expected! This was our first time to San Francisco. We decided not to rent a car. Thank goodness because the BART, Muni and Cable cars are all right outside of the hotel. Staff was wonderful in assisting us. We had a King Bed room 914 that over looked a side street, but we could also see the Bay Bridge. We got a great price via priceline. The restaurant was a little pricey, but we opted for more of the local restaurants. There is a Walgreens, Subway, Starbucks and many other small restaurants close to the hotel so everything was very convienent. It seemed this location was perfect for us. Union Square and Fisherman's warf area were so crowded we felt this area gave us some breathing room. Even if you don't take the public transportation, You can walk to SFMMOFA, Union Square, North Beach (little Italy), Fisherman's Warf if you don't mind some excercise. Walk one way and take the cable car back. Buy the 3 day or 7 day pass at the Port of San Fran on Embarqudero which is accross the street from the hotel in the back. Buy your Alcatraz tickets on line if you plan on going because they sell out. We also walked to ATT Staduim for a Giants game and took the Muni back. We took the BART to Oakland for the A's game. It's about a 20 min. ride and stops in front of hotel (underground of course) Great TRip, great hotel

<Content>Nice Hotel, good location Great location. Walking distance to most things downtown. Staff were willing to move our room due to the original one being located overlooking the ice rink which was due to play loud music until late in the evening. Rooms and bed were fine. On par with other hotels. One warning I would share is that parking in the hotel is outragiously expensive (around $50-$60/day). Also, the staff working at the budget rental car desk located in the hotel were extraordinarily unhelpful (bordering on rude) and they close in early afternoon on weekends forcing you to effectively pay for overnight parking in the hotel (unless you can find street parking) which, as noted above, is extremely expensive.

<Content>Wanted to teke the shampoo to compensate-- but a great location I will start with the positives. Beautiful lobby and central space. Great location that is perfect for a San Francisco visit - close to the ferry terminal, beautiful public spaces nearby, walking distance to downtown, Chinatown and waterfront. Just off of BART and streetcars. Many nice restaurants and eateries very close by. Walgreen's across the street. Lovely and quick glass elevators. Room was pleasing.  Now the negatives. For almost 300/ day I expected more than this. The business center charges 50 cents a minute for internet use. The refrigerator in your room is a computerized minibar that you cannot put your own water in without getting charged. The bed was like a canoe for my spouse and I; we kept rolling to the center! My daughter slept alone in a bed and had no complaints. The linen was nice on this bed, I just wish the mattress had been! The sink had faucets that were almost impossible to turn off with wet hands. I would have to dry my hands and then turn off water, and getting the right mix of hot and cold was impossible, once your hands were wet. So I suffered through too hot hand washings. The balcony space was appreciated, but I didn't like the railing made of slotted concrete. So, great location, and try to get a deal, or take the shampoo!

<Content>Good Location, indifferent service I liked the location of this hotel, it is very convenient to the Ferry Building and the California Street cable car. It is also great if you happen to be returning a Budget rental car as you just leave the car out front and formalities are quickly dealt with at a dedicated desk at the reception level.I had a refurbished club room on the 17th floor. The room which overlooked Market Street was fine but not exceptional. It had a great view of the Bay Bridge. The semi open bathroom just had a shower but the water temperature was so hot that it was almost impossible to have a shower. I reported the problem twice during my stay but nothing was ever done about it. When I mentioned it at check-out the receptionist simply removed a $8 phone charge in compensation. I was surprised that no toweling robes were supplied, toiletries were rather ordinary and room information was almost non-existent.The top floor Club Lounge was very pleasant and offers great views. Staff here were friendly and a good range of food items are offered although the rather limited range of alcoholic beverages are charged for. Other staff throughout the hotel made little impression and I thought my arrival was very poor. There was no welcome from the door staff and I was left to handle my luggage out of the car, up to reception and then to the room. Overall, one of my poorer Hyatt experiences.

<Content>Nice location I stayed here for a conference. The staff were helpful and the Atrium is quite a grand place. The room was fine - clean and spacious. Slightly odd smell to the hotel, probably something in their cleaning fluids? The hotel is close to the Piers and everything you want to see is within walking distance. Some of the reviewers have complained about the high price of breakfast. There is a croissant/bun shop ('Les Croissants') just across the road from the hotel entrance, I'd recommend buying breakfast from there.

<Content>Very nice place Stayed at the Hyatt for a conference in the hotel. We checked in very late and were upgraded to a suite on the 17th floor for $219. The view was incredible, looking SE out over the bay and the Bay Bridge. The room was very nice -- three TV's, including one in the bathroom mirror(!)The bed was comfortable with a nice selection of pillows. Minibar was way overpriced, as was the breakfast options in the hotel. There is a Starbucks across the street and a Peet's about a block away, so go there instead. Many breakfast options around. The service in the hotel was very nice. Everyone was friendly. The concierges were very helpful in navigating the BART on a couple excursions around the area.The hotel is a nice walk (just less than a mile) from Union Square, the big shopping district and from SFMOMA, which is a great museum. We walked Market Street several times.The hotel is RIGHT next to the California St Cable Car line and the Embarcadero entrance to MUNI and BART. Access to all these transportation options could not have been easier or closer.Parking at the hotel is very expensive. We paid $57 for one night until we could offload our rental car the next morning.

<Content>Great hotel in SF We stayed at this hotel for one night for a wedding at the Ferry Building, and we loved our experience. Our room actually had a balcony overlooking the Ferry Building. Finding a room with a balcony in SF can be hard, so we were very pleased. We ordered room service for breakfast, and it was great as well. I would suggest staying here while in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Hotel - My New Favorite Ive stayed at this property three times now in the past 3 months. Each time I have been impressed by the professionalism and helpfulness of the front desk staff. The last trip I had my mother with me for her first visit to San Francisco. I required two queen beds and wanted a BALCONY room so that we could enjoy our own private space to sit outdoors and enjoy views of the bay. The staff were very helpful in getting me this room - apparently they only have a few balcony rooms with two beds. I highly recommend the balcony rooms. THey are completely updated with flat screen tvs, the baths are updated - bot totally redone but very adequate. The highlight for us was the newly opened REgency Club space which is situated in the space that was previously occupied by the revolving restaurant. While it no longer revolves, it offers fantastic panorama views of the city and bay and excellent service, food, and beverage morning and night. THe staff here go above and beyond and the hotel has succeeded in creating a very special haven from a stressful day. By far the best Club room I've visited within the Hyatt chains.

<Content>Better than Most The Hyatt Regency San Francisco is much better than I expected after reading the previous reviews. I am always surprised at the negative comments such as average room or old hotel. If you reserve a regular room, you get just that, a regular room. If you want something extra, reserve a suite. Yes, it was built over 30 years ago, but there are some advantages to that. The common areas are much larger than other hotels and there is a huge atrium. When you are inside the atrium, it is so quiet and peaceful that it is hard to tell that the hustle and bustle of the city is just outside the door.The reality is that this is a Hyatt is like every other large Hyatt hotel in a big city. It is big, clean, staff are friendly and accommodating. Although the regular rooms are average in size, like all Hyatts I know, they are clean, well decorated and comfortable. As previously stated, the hotel is walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf (1 mile?) Union Square, (3/4 mile) and of course BART, buses and cable cars stop right out the front door.All things are relative of course depending on your expectations, and how much you pay for the room. But if you dont have Champagne tastes and a beer budget, you will be happy with this hotel.

<Content>Disappointed Check my other reviews, I generally only write when I love a hotel, but we had problems with the regency from the beginning. When we checked in, despite being GUARANTEED a KING size bed we were given a room with a full size bed (Yes FULL not queen). When I went down to request a different room I was told that there wasn't anything available that night but the manager would call me the following morning. Well no call, and when I asked that morning they said the manager would call, well he never did. On top of that our air conditioning didn't work, and it was hot in San Francisco that weekend, it took them two days to fix it. However, the hotel has a beautiful lobby, and was in relatively central location.

<Content>old hotel My girlfriends and I stayed at this hotel on the 18th-20th. I got a good deal through Priceline. The room was not modern, the tv was old school and there was a draft at night. But it was clean. We had two double beds, but they seemed smaller than normal. It's an old hotel, but you can't beat the location. It's so close to the Ferry Building which I love! The concierge was extremely helpful and nice. Parking: If you valet at the hotel it's $50. We parked at the Embarcadero center for $30, but there is no in and out privileges.

<Content>A Little Tired This Hotel was billed as a 4 star Hotel on Hotwire. I would guess that that was true about 10 years ago. First the good: It is in a great location particularly if you are doing business in the financial district. It is also close to China Town, the Ferry Building market, the waterfront and plenty of public transportation including the California street cable car. Like any Hyatt, it has a very impressive atrium housing a couple of restaurants and a cocktail lounge. Many of the rooms have balconies and many of those have water views. The problem is that the rooms are just beginning to look tired. The carpets are somewhat worn, the furniture has its share of scratches, no flat-screen HD TV's or DVD players, everything just needs to be updated. While the beds are generally quite comfortable, on my last trip one side of the bed had a distinct sag. Also be forewarned that the rooms on the Market St. side of this Hotel get a lot of street noise if you are on one of the lower floors. Like any business hotel, they are geared toward people on expense accounts so be prepared to pay through the nose for anything extra. Wireless Internet service is $10 per day, parking is about $50 per day and how about a couple of poached eggs for $19 bucks ... you get the picture. All in all it was worth the $110 I payed on Hotwire, but would require some updating to get me to pay anything like their rack rate of over $200.

<Content>Mixed review I stayed at the Hyatt for a conference. The conference rate offered to the attendees was the same as the regular rate posted on the hotel website, which I found a little odd. The hotel is in a great location, convenient to BART and right on the Embarcadero. The Ferry Building (across the street) is a fantastic place with wonderful restaurants and shops - we ate there several times during the conference. We also were lucky to have wonderful weather, and it was great to be able to stroll out of the hotel for a nice walk along the bay.The hotel is nice, but not outstanding. My room had a bay view (I paid for the upgrade) and a balcony, which was nice - beautiful morning view of the piers. The weird thing is, if you sit on the (very comfortable) balcony furniture, you can't see anything because the concrete railing is tall and thick. The room, as noted in other reviews, was nice, but kind of basic. Very nice bed and bedding, and very comfy desk chair, but the bathroom is kind of vintage, and the lighting over the bathroom sink is pretty bad. My room also had studs on the wall where apparently a framed picture once was; gave the room a half-finished look. The temperature control in the room was inefficient; there's one vent near the ceiling that pushes air in the general direction of the tv; takes a while to cool or warm the room, which was a problem as the large balcony door/window meant it was a bit drafty. Also, in my bathtub, the shower faucet was loose enough that it wouldn't stay put at the chosen temperature; the handle would just slowly sink until the water was scalding. I solved it by wedging a cardboard coffee cup sleeve (from the coffee service) between the handle and the rest of the fixture to stop the thing from sliding down, but sheesh.I didn't eat in the hotel, as there are so many other (less-expensive) options in the area. You have to pay $10 daily for internet, which always annoys me in hotels, especially those with rates like the Hyatt's. Housekeeping also was very late the first day I was there (i.e., returned to a still un-cleaned room at 4:30pm). It was subsequently cleaned earlier (not sure if that had to do with the fact that I leave a daily tip with a thank you note). Housekeeping staff I passed in the hallway were unfailingly friendly and courteous.I can't recommend the Hyatt for people who are expecting true 4 or 5 star accommodations, although the location is great and the staff are good.

<Content>Great Hotel This holiday was a suprise for my 30th Birthday and it didn't disappoint. San Francisco is a lovely city, great weather and lots to see and do. It has a different feel from alot of your US Cities.On arrival to the Hyatt Regency we were greeted by a very friendly guy who assured us we had a nice room and he was right, the room was on the 10th floor with a side view of the bay, it was lovely. The rooms are very big and the bed is even bigger, we stayed for 6 nights and this room was very comfortable for us,The lobby area looks great and has a very nice feel to it, not stuffy at all and very welcoming.The staff are extremely polite and accomodating and the guys on the door,Location is perfect, in the financial district but on the outskirts and a 20 min walk along the front will take you to the hub of Fishermans Wharf.I would say the only disappointment was the revolving restaurant being cloased until May 08 , this was something we were not made aware of, but over all a great stay and would highly recommend.

You will be charged for everything! $55 per day for parking (and we were not told), mini-bar charges are high, a veiw will cost $35 more per day. Management was rude and criticized us for booking on priceline. I've stayed at Hyatt hotels before and loved them! I don't understand why this location had such poor service.

<Content>Okay for a short trip The Hyatt Regency San Francisco is clearly a dated hotel, but renovations to the rooms have kept it up to par with other mid-level Hyatts (although it may be a bit overpriced). The location is great, right on the Embarcadero and across from the Ferry Terminal. There is also a cable car line right outside the door. We did go through 3 rooms before finding one that was nice, due to awkward window placement in the first rooms. The front desk staff was very kind as well as the concierge. Valet parking was $50/day and the valet threatened that other parking lots were far more expensive. I guess that comes with the territory in San Francisco.

<Content>Awesome wiht a capital A The Hyatt is one of the cities hospitality gems. I had the opportunity to stay in one of their new Regency Club rooms and they are incredible. Although Regency Club cost more money, you get access to their roof top lounge (on par with the concierge levels at Ritz, etc) and has the best views in all of San Fran. There are also 5 daily food presentations (including breakfast, snacks, apps and dessert) and tye are all to die for, I highly recommend you check out the new Regency Club rooms on your next trip to San Fran. It is well worth it.

<Content>Loved it! I booked two adjoining rooms here for two nights on the hotel website and paid $143 for each room.I found the hotel location perfect for our needs. We caught a taxi to the hotel from SFO and then rented a car from the Budget desk in the lobby two days later. I had read of the high cost of parking a car here and figured we would rely on public transit during our stay and then rent the car when we were ready to leave for our journey South which worked out well.The staff was great. I had a coupon for $100 off my stay and there was no problem in redeeming it. I had requested two double beds in each of the two rooms and this was granted. They initially told me they had me in a King and a double but then two days before I left home they emailed me that they were able to accommodate my request for adjoining rooms with two coubles in each. I was impressed with this.I called the hotel prior to arrival to confirm everything since I was traveling with my mom, a niece, and a friend of the niece and wanted all the details to go well--all did.We had a tour on the first morning and it left from the ferry terminal--a short walk away. Since the hotel is in the financial district many of the places near the hotel cater to the business community and don't stay open in the evenings. The shops in the ferry terminal are great for lunch but close early. We walked down to Sinbad's, adjacent to the ferry bldg for one evening meal and it was okay, but pricey for the quality. The hotel room was great. I did not appreciate the Internet fee or the annoying mini-bar that I had to warn the kids about opening due to the senstive nature of the contents, etc. I really wish hotels would abandon using these things, but the water pressure in the room was good and the beds were comfortable. The walls were a bit thin and like a previous reviewer we had a domestic disturbance in the room next door with lots of yelling and screaming and profanity--all of this after we were in bed so quite annoying and not the fault of the hotel. At one point I thought I might need to call security, but they finally quieted down before I felt compelled to have someone intervene. We had daily newspaper delivery, reading material in the room, and nice amenities. All in all-- a very good stay and I would stay here again. Easy to get taxi at hotel or trolley behind hotel across from the terminal--

<Content>Good hotel, excellent location December 2007 was my second time at Hyatt Regency San Francisco. The location is perfect to explore most attractions. There is a metro station and a cable car stop within a walking distance. The Port of San Francisco is across the road. It is one of the best views of Bay Bridge. Powell Street is within walking distance.The outstanding design reduces some room space. The hotel has not changed significantly since my first stay in early 1990's. Although the rooms had minor improvements, there is more to be done.The rooms are clean and comfortable. Wifi is available. The restaurant staff is very friendly. The breakfast is very good. The Equinox restaurant was closed, leaving me somewhat disappointed.

<Content>Great stay at the Hyatt Embarcadero Just spent a nice, comfortable week at the Hyatt Embarcadero. I took BART from the airport, and the Embarcadero station is literally across the street from the hotel. This was my second time here. The front desk was courteous and gave me an early check-in, and the lobby area was immaculate. With six elevators, I never had to wait more than 30 seconds the whole time I was there. I was fortunate to get a business class room on the 6th floor, which means it's controlled by an access key and you get a work desk and chair with ottoman in a nice-sized room. I had a great view of the San Francisco sign and the piers. The room itself was immaculate - I actually didn't see one thing wrong with it. I have to say that the bed wasn't a fluffy Marriott bed, but I found it to be comfortable. I also always had a hot shower with full pressure, which was nice. I ate once at the hotel cafe, only because I got a free continental breakfast voucher. There were more than the standard melons on the fruit tray, including shaved salmon, plus a good variety of hot and cold cereals, yogurts, juices, and coffee. The menu says this is priced at $19, which I personally think is double what it should be, but it's a nice splurge if you had to pay for it. I've actually eaten here before during another stay, and the food is really, really good, just expensive. I managed to save money by eating at Subway or the shops in The Embarcadero; I never ordered room service. As for the $9.95 internet charge, I wouldn't pay it if I were on vacation, but I think the management knows their hotel is going to be used primarily for business folks like me who are going to expense the cost.  I've stayed at the Hilton (rooms the size of a walk-in closet!) and the Park Galleria, which is why I chose the Hyatt Embarcadero again. You really can't beat its convenience to BART, the Embarcadero shops, and the Walgreens and Starbucks across the street.

<Content>Wouldn't stay again Another reviewer spoke of the added fees for everything. We brought our own laptop and it cost $9.95 a day for a wireless connection. On the last day, we decided just to use the business center to print out boarding passes, check e-mail, etc... These were complimentary, but if you did anything else, it was .50 a minute. Also on our last day, we decided to eat breakfast in the Atrium. The menu prices were outrageous, so we opted for the Continental buffet - w/o asking the price. It was $27 a person for what you normally get for free at any Embassy Suites. Luckily we didn't rent a car - the price to park was $50 a night.  The concierges were hit and miss. Some were helpful - some were rude. Trying to figure out the transportation system was crazy-we have used the transit systems in London, Paris, and NY w/o a problem. San Fran is crazy. You have to get off the upper cable cars then go underground to go on to other destinations. When we ask one concierge to help us out, he became exasperated. Luckily the woman working next to him said the transit system is odd and gave us a better explanation on how to get around. Our room was okay - we had a bay view but the room was very drafty. When we turned on the heat, the fan squeaked all night. They have a mini bar which you do not dare to touch or they will charge you. We would have preferred having an empty frig, but they charge $30 to empty the mini bar so you can use if for your own items. There is also a problem with vagrants near the hotel. We never left w/o a homeless person begging us for money. In the underground transit, a guy offered to give us advice on how to navigate the system, then asked for money. My husband gave him a couple of dollars and we left. For the price, I won't stay at this Hyatt location again.

<Content>Great location, hard to fault Three of us [self, wife and 12 year old] spent 6 nights at the hotel. Some reviewers had given the Hyatt poor reviews. We loved it. Sure the atrium is a little bit 80s but staff were positive and helpful. Because the Regency Club was closed for 'renovations' we were upgraded to the buffet breakfast in the atrium cafe. This was an unexpected bonus. Fabulous selection of food. [we didn't need lunch]. Attentive staff kept topping up juice and coffee to the point of being annoying. Hyatt is in the 'financial district' which is preferable to the touristy Pier 39 area. Peir1 is an excellent upmarket source of food - fabulolous cheese shop; but I can't remember it's name. Cable car, street cars, trolloey buses at your door. Buy a MUNI pass.The express check out is brilliant ... your account is put under the door ... if you agree with it, dial a 4 digit number and answer the yoice prompts and check out is complete. Leave the door access cards in your room and go. Great when you have a 5.30 am flight to catch. Only minor negative was the domestic argument in the next room on our last night; but this disturbance can happen in any hotel sadly.

<Content>Good location, but hotel is dated I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights to attend a conference. It has good accessibility and no car is needed. The BART train from the airport arrives just an escalator ride away from the front entrance of the hotel. It has easy access to many places in downtown San Francisco such as Chinatown (an easy 5 block walk) and a short street car ride to Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel rooms have nice views of the Bay bridge and the port across the street. The nearby small park usually has vendors selling crafts and jewelry. The rooms were of average size, not too exciting, and the sliding doors were really drafty. The bed was comfortable. Internet access is 9.95 a day, and should be included in a room costing 289.00 a night. The food we had supplied through the conference was very good, continental breakfasts with freshly made baked goods that reminded me of european-quality bakery items. The staff was helpful with directions. This is a good choice if you do not have a car to see the city and you need easy access to the airport.

<Content>Wait for the renovation Time for Hyatt to catch up with modern day. Nice people, but the facility leaves much to be desired. 32 regular TVs, musty carpet and dated bathrooms are a dead giveaway.Don't stay here if you need to be right next to the Moscone. It is a brisk 15 minute walk at best.Don't bet on room service selection, b/c they are very limited and looks like they havent updated the menu in over a decade. (from the stains on it and the small selection.If you have other options in the category of hotel.... wait for the renovation and take the other alternative.

<Content>Would never go back! We stayed at the Hyatt due to it's proximity to the Embarcadero Center, where our company has an office. I can't argue with the convenience, but that simply isn't enough. This hotel obviously experienced it's heyday in the late 70s and early 80s. Attempts that have been made at renovation are superficial. I checked on the website after we checked in, to confirm that it said granite bath. A piece of granite has been placed over the old vanity top. The bathtub itself (and the fixtures, lighting etc) is reminiscent of your average roadside Holiday Inn from the late 70s.We were given the option for an upgraded bay-view room on checkin, for an additional $40/night. It rained during our stay, and we awoke to significant water leaking through the sliding door. We informed the management, but nothing was ever done. The gym is comically small for such a large hotel, and again clearly an afterthought. Only a few machines and no real room to do free weights, etc.Overall, we paid a significant price for a very marginal hotel. Hyatt should be more careful with it 's name.

<Content>It was nice but...I mean it is a Hyatt...what I expected but nothing stellar I stayed at the Hyatt from Jan 24-27th for a conferenceThe first night rate was 269 and the other two nights were 200 (conference rate)...Please also see my Parc 55 review during the same stay.1. Location and Size: Unlike the Parc 55 hotel which has 1000 rooms compared to this hotel's 800, the Hyatt feels massive. The moment you walk off its street level you are shown a map that has all its various levels for conference rooms and check in etc. Once I found the atrium to check in ( left the luggae with the bellman) I was asked it I wanted to upgrade my room for 35 dollars a night to a bay view. I said no thank you. I figured I wouldn't get an upgrade anyway. I mean it is a Hyatt so they kinda give off the vibe they don'ty have to try and impress you with perks such as upgrades get to make you smile. Kinda like, if you had the money you would of gotten it already. It was ok, I had had my great view the night before :). It was raining a lot so I didn't take in the locations pro/cons. Overall it was an asset. The cable car stops in front of the hotel and you can get a troplly to FWarf if you'd like in front of the Ferry building. The cons were that since it is in the financial district all the nearby stores like Starbucks, Coffe bean and tea leaf, and Walgreens closed super early. No 11pm coffee here. Staff: When I went up to my room the first time I found it has just been finished being cleaned. I noticed later that there was a sink problem (no biggie the sink just fiulled up quickly) I guess the maid from the previously must of reported it becaue the next afternoon I had a matienance man show up to unclog the sink. I just wished the hotel at notified me with a phone call because I had to wait 15 min for the facilities person to fix the sink when I had wanted to relx and change clothes for the next part of my day (post conference). The concereige had a great attitude and was fery helpful in sending me to the Ferry Building for Food which was AWESOME ( you must go|)Room: It was nice, ok view, bit of the bay. You have to be cool with your inner exhibitionist because bascically since I was on the 7th floor (or 10 by their elevator) I was smack in front of a bunch of office buildings so people can watch you if the draps are opened ( didn't matter much to me). CON: The mini-bar. If you TOUCH or MOVE anything, you WILL BE CHARGED FOR IT..the pro was that all the locals I told this story were shocked and laughed with me about how absurd it was. If you want to rent the fridge it is $30 bucks a day and the housekeeping staff must remove all the items. Other facts: Their restaurant on the rooftop is closed currently. That would of been nice. The business center charges 5.95 for 15 min of internet and 35 cents after that. You cannot charge it to your room and must use a credit card. I mean it was ok..the conference was well-organized, and I did grow to like the Hyatt. It just wasn't stellar with the exception that the Ferry Building, its food and gifts is the BEST!

<Content>Loved this Hotel! We stayed at this hotel during the week between Christmas and New Year's and it was awesome. My husband and I were traveling with our three children and their two cousins, so we had two rooms. The rooms were beautiful and unusually large for a hyatt and a big city. There is an entrance area to the room that is separate from the room itself, and is a great area for storage, so the room, itself, doesn't feel cluttered. We had an awesome view of the Bay Bridge, which we were not at all expecting. (Ask for a room facing the water/bridge; it costs the same and is much nicer than looking at another tall building.) The lobby is beautiful with stunning lights hanging from the extremely tall (17 floors?) ceiling. At christmastime, the lobby is decorated with holiday villages that are spectacular. The kids loved looking at them. The location of the hotel is great. You are across the street from the Ferry Building, which has lots of stores/restaurants, and you are a 15 minute walk away from Union Square and a large indoor shopping mall on Market Street. You could also probably walk to Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf. Since we were a party of seven, we could not all fit into one cab. So, we often took the hotel limousine, which costs about $30. to take you (one way) to most places in the city. (This price was only slightly more than paying for two cabs, and obviously much more pleasant. The limo driver was very nice and the car was clean and roomy.) Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Comfortable  Hyatt Regency was a very nice hotel, with a spectacular open-air lobby ... streamed with holiday lights and Christmas village, train displays during our stay. Upon entering the lobby via escalators, one is overwhelmed with the lights cascading from the top.The front desk was pleasant, though not very flexible. We booked a room via Priceline bid, and requested a high floor, but given lower floor. Given the hotel did not seem fully booked or crowded, we presumed it was b/c we booked thru Priceline (and the low rate). In fact, the front desk tried 'selling' us on an upgrade for a higher floor, with balcony, with a view of SF Bay for an additional $30. That's a third of our rate! We declined.The room was on the 4th floor and had a view of Market Street, and the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge. So we got some views anyway... The room was fine, with King size bed, basic toiletries, coffee maker...and an in-room safe. The bathroom was a little small, and dated but sufficient. Our only issue was the a/c-heat was not very consistent. Wish they had a thermostat vs a cool-warm range for fan, and there was no auto setting. At times it was very warm, and vice versa .. .depending on when we turned on, how long, etc. Not a big deal, as we weren't in room much.Hotel is at the Embarcadero area, mostly offices .. but very convenient to the Ferry building, street cars, BART, buses and cable car terminus on California St (essentially right outside of hotel). At night, it's very quiet, given offices empty out, and especially the weekend when we were there. They did have weekend food market and arts/crafts vendors selling wares between the hotel to the Ferry building. Overall, a pleasant stay here. Easy access to public transportation and waterfront.

<Content>Great location. Rooms need an upgrade We stayed here due to the great location. At the top of the escalator from Embarcadero Bart/MUNI, across the street from the Ferry Building, California Street Cable car outside the front door and walkway to Embarcadero shopping (Chevy's, Tony Romas, Gaylord, and others). Definitely loved the location.The lobby and the overall service was great as expected from a Hyatt.We did have a couple issues:1) The rooms and hallways are dated. TV is smaller (not flat screen), art/walls look a bit worn, and the overall feel is dated once outside the lobby area.2) The breakfast buffet was nice but expensive ($27.00 ) We got two free buffets with AAA but this didn' cover our kids, so we still had to pay half for each child. From around 9:15 on, there was a longish line for the buffet3) The room featured Grand Hyatt linens. These were great. However, for some reason, the beds didn't have a mattress pad, just the fitted sheet over the bare mattress. Odd.Again, excellent staff and service. We would stay here again due to the location. However, as the other reviews also state, if a high class hotel is what you are looking for over location, the Grand Hyatt might be a better fit.

<Content>Great hotel overall Our first trip to the states and this hotel was recommended to us by friends.We stayed 7 nights and the first room we had was facing the city ,this was fine but became very noisy in the early hours as refuse collectors made a lot of noise. We were moved to a side bay view which was much better if a little darker(natural light).This is generally a well appointed hotel in a good location for the major attactions, public transport has good links and the california line tram is right outside the hotel . Price included breakfast which was excellent , great choices and very friendly/helpful staff.The hotel was clean and all the staff seemed friendly. I would recommend this hotel as all round it was very good value, and made an excellent base from which to explore the city and surrounding area.

The bathroom was a little bit outdated for a 4* hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. However, the parking was very expensive ($55/day!). We were also disappointed with the room service (e.g. a yogurt in the breakfast we ordered in the room was expired since 2 weeks...). But overall it remained a quite pleasant experience.

<Content>Loved the hotel, hated the noise We booked this hotel and got a great price through Priceline- around $100 per night but then upgraded for another $30 for a view of the bayand breakfast. Because it was the holiday season the ice skating rink was up and running and even though we were 9 stories up it was very loud and the music didn't stop until 11:00. We had our 5 year old withus or we wouldn't have been back so early. I wouldn't recommend eatingthe hot buffet breakfast runny eggs, etc. I would stay again. The holiday decoration were nice in the lobby.

<Content>55 bucks a night for parking at a four star hotel? They're insane. While centrally located with an excellent view, as a priceline hotel this location makes no sense. You might GET the hotel room for 60 bucks a night, but the price for parking, FOR GUESTS, is an unheard of 55 dollars a night including tax. Moreover, internet service is both spotty AND expensive as their wifi will run you $9.99 a day. Overall, for one night, it's fine. Not great but fine. But if you DO go. Park across the street at the Embarcadero parking structure. There, the price is only 25 dollars a day for parking. Granted, there's a lovely lobby and it's located right by the cable cars. But there are plenty of VERY NICE three star hotels with free wifi and FREE parking. If you get this hotel on Priceline, good luck to you.

<Content>Great Location, Great Views I've stayed twice at the Hyatt Embarcadero, most recently around Thanksgiving 2007 for 3 nights. This hotel has a breathtaking atrium which when decorated with holiday lights makes it look even better.I had reserved a room for about $150/night but I decided to upgrade to a room facing the bay on the 15th floor for an additional $30. My room was first class in every respect and the bed was great. There was a nice work desk where I could use my laptop (the WiFi cost an extra $10/day).The balcony afforded a nice view of the city and the bay. I didn't eat in the restaurant, the buffet breakfast was listed at $27 and I thought that was way too high. I did use the bar twice, it's also a little pricy ($10 for a glass of average white wine). They used to have a revolving restaurant/bar at the top which now seems to be closed, not sure if it's going to reopen.The location can't be beat as it is just steps to BART (which I took to and from the airport) and one of the cable car which has NO WAIT to get on, compared to the one on Powell where you have to wait 20-30 minutes to get on the cable car.One negative thing is that the hotel was built in the early 70s when concrete design was fashionable, and today that looks very dated (ugly). The balconies have a nice view but all the concrete surroundings puts you off and you don't feel like sitting out there, There are also a lot of birds that make a mess on the concrete.Still, I love this hotel and think it's worth every penny, it's not cheap but not expensive by San Francisco standards either.

<Content>Mixed Experience We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for one night for $94 on Priceline. We were pretty happy with our stay but would have been quite upset if we had paid full price. There was some sort of construction going on at the hotel's entrance and it wasn't at all clear how to get up to the lobby area so we and several others had to mill around in a confused state for a few minutes before climbing up a broken escalator. We were upgraded to a room on a higher floor with a Bay view and breakfast for another $30 which was a good deal, as Sunday breakfast can be hard to come by in that area. The room itself was nice enough and we had no problems with the staff, who were all friendly and helpful, but one very odd, and to me inexcusable, thing was that there was no hotel bar open at 11:00 on a Saturday night. A private function was just finishing up at the hotel's bar, so that was not available. The cafe was supposed to be closed, but we saw a bar similar to what you would find at someone's house party in the cafe, and asked if we could buy a drink and take it somewhere else. The attendant said ok but had a really sad selection of wine - we're talking Robert Mondavi being the best one -- and for $10.00 per glass at that! Not to sound like an alcoholic, but what nice hotel doesn't have a fully functioning bar open on a Saturday night?The lobby itself is rather cold and anything but intimate. After sitting around with our drinks for a few minutes, we had no desire to stay there anymore, so gulped them down and went back up to our room.The hotel is well situated for public transportation and you can easily get to almost anywhere the average tourist would go. Next time if I want to stay in the area, I would rather stay at the Harbour Court down the street, which has a lot more charm than the Hyatt, which seems much more like a business hotel than a tourist hotel.

<Content>Outdated and overpriced My husband and I reserved the Regency Club City View package for originally 7 nights (but after booking changed to 3 nights), complete with views of the bay, private lounge access with breakfast, hors d'oeuvres and cocktails in the evenings, and supposedly very upscale decor and ammendments at ~$379 per night. We arrived late to check in our first night, as we had been traveling for approximately 24 hours that day. The host at the reception desk told us they had overbooked our room and that he would have to give us the last room available, but neglected to tell us it was a smoking room. Being nonsmokers we were extrememly disappointed and I demanded they get us another room or comp the room as we had booked a month in advance. He comped the room, and promised to give us his best room the next evening. We moved to the 16th floor, with a balcony, where we decided to have breakfast that morning. We left the balcony for 2 min and returned to find 200 pigeons pecking at our plates. Apparently one (or all 200) had gotten into the room, since I had found fresh pigeon droppings by the sliding door. So, I scanned the floor in the room and noticed that some droppings (dried and thus old ) had gone as far as the bathroon! This meant that the floor had not been cleaned or vaccuumed in quite a long time. I was completely disgusted-for $379 a night the room should have been sparkling clean. We will never stay at this hotel again.I should also mention the positive things (there are few)..the location was great, the staff was friendly, the continental breakfast was fresh and cocktail lounge was a nice touch in the evenings before going out on the town. The gym facilities were adequate and clean. Overall, not a clean, comfortable stay, and the decor and cleaning staff need to be updated and replaced. There are so many great hotels in San Francisco, this one should not be your first choice.

<Content>Nothing special I stayed at the Hyatt Regency at the Embarcadero center for a conference at the end of October and found the place overpriced for what it offers. The room was ok but, as many of these chain hotels, this one too should renew the bathrooms replacing the old rusted baths with efficient showers. Also, there was just one restaurant inside the hotel, and thought it was not very busy, it took ages to get the check after the meal. The front desk staff was disastrous: we were sharing the room and it took three printouts to get the receipts right (they kept mixing up names and addresses). The location though is good, just opposite a Bart-Muni station and close to the Ferry Building, and within walking distance from Union Square.

<Content>Nice stay Many have given mixed reviews to this property. My wife and I enjoyed it quite a bit. My wife stay in SF a lot. Mostly at the Grand Hyatt. This was here first stay at the Regency and she was quite impressed. Very quiet room and even w/ balcony door open(for a large city). We missed the sax music. Yes, a balcony w/ two chairs and a table. We stayed on a Regency Club floor, 16 out of 17. Nice morning and evening refreshments. It is crazy to not join hotels frequent stay clubs even if you only travel a little. The location was great for shopping at Union Square. And was directly across from the Ferry building. My wife will stay there in the future and I know I want to go back too. Clean rooms and building. Nice, helpful staff. We arrived by plane, took the BART from the airport and ended up at the door of the hotel. A car in SF is not my idea of a good time and valet parking is only one of my concerns.

Rooms are clean and even though our room was stuck in a tiny corner of the hotel is was quite. No problems with staff. This is a good choice for people who've been SF a couple of times and don't want to see Union Square and Pier 39, though they are easy to get to from the hotel's location. Muni's light rail is across the street at the Ferry building, and bart's on the corner. Would stay there again, no problems at all during my trip.

<Content>the sax is good and bad My fiance and I stayed here for his birthday. The room itself was clean and the view of the bay was very nice. The location was so-so but we were close to one of our now favorite restaurants. The hotel lobby and general decor could use a facelift. Compared to other four star hotels in the city, this hotel does not measure up. Our one complaint does not arise from the hotel itself, but from the surrounding area involving a ruthless saxophone player. The music echoed and made the street musician seem like he was in our room! We arrived at the hotel around 7PM and the saxophone music, which included Jingle Bells, continued well into the night. In the morning, we were unpleasantly awoken at approximately 9AM by the Kenny G flunkee. We did not receive a restful morning due to the unknown male who needs his musical instrument seized by force if necessary.

<Content>Excellent room but go elsewhere to eat Stayed last 4 days in August on business trip. Location is excellent - central to shopping/eating/attractions. Checking in/out was very quick and courteous. The foyer is very impressive. Got Kingsize room on second floor (quiet for a second floor) - very good sized room. Nice view over Bay area. Room spotless. Had tea making facilities and lots of tv channels. The minibar was very large but quite expensive - 4USD for a bottle of water . I would recommend calling help-desk for wireless internet connectivity. My European bank called at 4am to notify me of uncharacteristic authorizations on my credit card - this was caused by me trying to pay for wireless access through their site and repeatedly telling me that my card was declined when in fact authorizations were put through. I then had problems trying to get an outgoing connection from the hotel phone to stop my bank from freezing my card but eventually it was resolved.Breakfast is not cheap at 26USD (+tip) for the buffet. Unless you've got an huge appetite, I would recommend ordering off the menu or going elsewhere.I had dinner on one evening - fillet steak - although reasonably priced, it was quite bland and there were only about 4 other people in a sizable dining area (the chicken starter was quite poor). San Fran has some great places to eat so do not eat dinner in the hotel.I didn't use the gym facilities but take a walk around hilly San Fran with it's spectacular views and you won't need any other exercise.For business trips, I would recommend the Hyatt but might be a bit pricey for a vacation.

The good:The beds were very nice.Had tube TV, clock radio, extra synthetic pillow, cosmetic mirror, coffe maker, hair dryer and iron.Conclusion:Guess this hotel would be ok if it was updated.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Location We decided to stay at this hotel after previously staying in Fishermans Wharf and this is a much better location - so much mroe central and if you do their park and play package which comes with breakfast and free parking all the better.Having a car in San Fran makes the world of difference - our previous trips we were reliant on taxis and walking - which was not so bad but to get off the beaten track and see some amazing parts of SF def get a car!The hotel concierge team were great at ensuring we had maps and info.The breakfasts were fine for the included price and they always took great care of our 3 year old.The only complaint we had was the room next door was full of College students who decided to party from 1am until 6am - not great for us at all. Told the hotel who offered us free breakfast but that didn't mean much to us as we were already having breakfasts included. All in all I would recommend this hotel to all sorts of groups!

<Content>Stingy x 10 I was shocked to hear that the valet parking was $50+ a day! Even though San Francisco has little parking, this rate is outrageous. Not only that, but they charged internet, which has been free for nearly every hotel I've stayed in. Because the summer there was very chilly (like Mark Twain said), I wanted to swim indoors, but the hotel does not have a swimming pool. The Em barcadero center that the hotel is in not bad. The restaurants in the center are an excellent spot for lunch with choices ranging from classic deli sandwhiches to pizza to sushi and there are plenty of hungry pigeons to feed. I would recommend this hotel strictly for business people that will have their expenses paid. The environment at the is good for a conference, maybe not a family trip.

<Content>Great location, average hotel Spent one night at the Hyatt and, while I loved the location, I was not so pleased with the hotel itself. I booked a room on one of the Business Plan floors, thinking this might be a little nicer than average. My mistake. What I got was a room on a floor just like all the others, except I had to swipe my key card in the elevator to punch my floor's button. Before I arrived, the hotel sent me an e-mail from the E-Concierge offering a variety of services for free and for extra cost. I responded by asking for extra towels and the New York Times, but got neither. The hotel is huge and built during the era of the giant interior courtyard (much like the Marriott Marquis in New York City). The now-dated interior is dark and damp (a stream runs through the lobby, which is probably the moisture source). The corridors are narrow and dark. The room itself is a bit dated and the bathroom is small. Mold was present on the seam between the tub and the wall. Given the cost of the room, I expected better.

<Content>Very Nice, standard Hyatt fair Hotel was very nice. We had a semi corner room that could see the bay bridge. Ammenities were all there and standard fair for a upscale business hotel. One downside however was the rotating restaurant. Wasn't really worth it for the price and the wall was a tad dirty, so ever full rotation, we would see that black smudge on the wall. There are so many great restaurants in SF that I would recommend that you look elsewhere for either drinks or food. The bar downstairs in the lobby was also a bit wanting. Not too many people, and tried to be a little too hip for what it really was, a lobby bar.

<Content>Nice, but parking blows The hotel was very nice and clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It is in good location to transit stops that will take you either to Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square. Parking however should be budgeted into your trip. The hotel's valet parking is 50 dollars a day plus tips. The parking at the 3 Embarcadero building is 30 dollars a day if you never remove your car. I'm unsure if this is normal for San Fran. Just make sure to budget parking into your hotel stay.

<Content>Best hotel experience in SF We were pleasantly surprised to get a room at the Hyatt through Priceline for a bid that was less than have the advertised rate. Then at check-in they offered to upgrade us to a bayside view for $35. Best money I've ever spent. We got a 15th floor king with a balcony and a gorgeous view of the Bay. The room was impeccable and the hotel staff was helpful and courteous almost to a fault. It was by far the best experience I've had at any hotel in San Francisco or elsewhere in many years.

<Content>Excellent - Well Worth it The hotel was my safe haven after a nightmare overnight stay in another hotel in Union Square. The Hyatt saved my trip to SFO. I would recommend that you opt for the business plan if you have the option for the few extra bucks you have an excellent breakfast down in the restaurant. The food is excellent. The concierge was extremely helpful in helping me plan my day and night excursions around SF. They helped me book a city tour (well worth the money) and a helicopter ride (highly recommend). The bell staff was also very kind and respectful. They will hold your luggage in a locked room while you wait for transportation to the airport or want walk around the city before you leave. Right outside the hotel you can get on a trolley car that takes you up to Union Square. The hotels backdoors lead you right to the Market Terminal. If you want to be away from the Wharf and don鈥檛 mind the expense of the hotel, I recommend this hotel. The room was very spacious as well as the bathroom. The balcony overlooked the water sculptor display and the bay. I was able to watch the parade of tall ships. The noise at night is very little. You can sleep with your balcony door open (don鈥檛 recommend it 鈥?pigeons).

<Content>Nice place, very expensive Huge hotel in a great location. Nice room, spacious with great view of the Ferry Buillding. They charge you for EVERYTHING! Internet is $10 a day. Parking is $50 a day. Room service and in hotel dining are UNREAL! The real kicker is the mini bar. We usually bring water and milk to put in the mini bar. Here's what happened, we opened the door and started to take out the contents and noticed a small label in the fridge. The label warned you that the contents were AUTOMATICALLY added to your bill as soon as they were removed from the fridge by sensors in the fridge. Once removed it's yours. If you want them to remove the contents so you can use the fridge it will cost you $20!!!!! Although a pleasant stay we will not stay on our next trip in three weeks. There are other hotels in the area that don't rob you as blatantly as the Hyatt. Oh, and one other problem is the elevators. Tourists not staying in the hotel come to ride the elevators to see the atrium. They wait in the elevators until someone with a keycard enters and they ride them up and down like they're at Disneyland. Got very annoying after a couple days.

<Content>Just so so for Hyatt-nothing special I stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero Wed. June 6 - Fri. June 8th on business for a conference rate of $200 (much less than the lowest $350 AAA rate I could find) booked through a special website. I must say that the hotel is large hotel with nice atrium in the middle with checkin on the second flor of the hotel with conference rooms on first level and below - setup is little strange. Strange meaning bars and main resturant on the same second level as checkin/registration desk and open air with rooms all facing inward. Very easy to get to from OAK airport using AirBART ($3 exact change each way) and BART train ($3.35 each way exact change or credit at tix machine) to the Embarcadero station stop. Now, on with my review.....Checkin was breeaze with many checkin agents available, however not easy to switch rooms - at least for my conference and I am Platinum Passport level, so I was stuck with a third floor on the Market St. side standard room, and got to listen to the Market St buses idle all day  night, and saxophone musicians play the Godfather theme every single morning on the street at the crack of dawn.Pros:Early checkin was availableCan view hotel bill on room tvComfy beds with insulated walls- you do not hear your neighborsLarge tv's in roomiron and board in roomGood water pressure/hot water all timesClose to many restaurants for nice luches and dinners outCable line begins and ends right in front of hotelEasy to get a cab7-11 convenience store right across street for main entrance for snacks, water, gum, etc.Starbucks directly across the street right next to the 7-11 cstoreFast elevetorsPlentiful elevators - 6 if I remember correctly10-15 minute walk to Union SquareSafe area to walk at nightLate checkout provided at checkinCons:Expensive roomsMaid came in room even when I put privacy card on door - luckily I was clothed and working at the deskinernet access is $10 a day - 24 hour time begins when you activateExpensive to drink and eat in hotel - better to walk to other places in areaRooms are small for a Hyatt and the moneyStaff not very friendly but efficientBilling errors - I was charge for movies I did not order every nigh of my stay, but was corrected easily at front desk.Lower floor rooms are very noisy through the window side of roomBar was always closed - never any staff available in bar (many guests were complaining about bar being closed including some visitors meeting guests) NOTE: Bar on top floor of this hotel closed permanently at end of May.Parking-Not sure about parking since I would not rent a car in SF unless paning to go out to wine country, but saw a logjam in front of hotel with some guests irriated in tie it took to get thier cars fro valet. I think hotel may be valet only also ( $30 - $50 per day and no in/out priviledges)Lunch and dinner hotel food was not very good. Bfast was great.Recommendations:Stay somewhere else in Union Square area like the Westin for equal level of hotel rating or the Le Meridien near this Hyatt Emb.Get a room on the highest floor possible above street noiseDo not get a room on the Market St side ) I believe room #'s that end in 01 - 12 are on that street. I was in Room # 308 which was not good due to street noiseCheck your bill - mine had errorsAvoid breakfast in the hotel, great bfast food but pricey ($40 for buffet for one person) - Go to Max's Diner one block off Union Square for breakfast connected to the Maxwell Hotel (another review for me) on Geary St. insteadwhich is a 15 minute walk but worth it.Bring ear plugsLunch and dinner food in hotelI would not stay at this Hyatt again for business or personal travel.That's all.

<Content>Location  If you want conveinence then this is your place. BART, Muni  Trolley car right outside the door. Also the Ferry Bldg is across the street with plenty of food. There is a shopping  restaurant area next to the bldg so you can find clothing if you need and places to eat. The rooms are nicely decorated, updated and clean. The rooms are quiet, no thin walls here. Ask for a room on the Bay side and you will be rewarded with amazing views. The Bay Bridge is out your window. We were engaged in SF 14 years ago and came back to eat at the same restaurant. We had the concierge set up the reservation. When we came back to our room, there was champagne, strawberries as well as cookies  milk for our kids! That was a special touch and it won't be forgotten. Steve at the concierge desk is awesome! All the staff was very friendly and helpful there was no snobby pretension here. It was pricier than some of the other chain hotels and cheaper than a Ritz but well worth it for a memorable stay. Also, if you are looking for a quiet place to eat breakfast - take BART to Union Square and walk to O'Farrell st. Santorini restaurant serves an amazing breakfast. We were there on a weekday about 9 am. We had the place to ourselves and the food was incredible. Happy travels!

<Content>Nice hotel, for one so large What a great property - it's in great shape and the atrium is impressive. If you can, get a room with a balcony facing the harbor - I lucked out.The staff, when encountered was professional and courteous at every turn. The concierges know all the restaurants and provided two fabulous recommendations while we were there.The only knocks I give it are the following:1. the gym is way too small for a hotel with that many rooms. Definitely need bigger.2. the exhibit and conference space is converted from an old garage, so the ceilings are rather low in those areas.This hotel serves the Hyatt brand well.

<Content>Large hotel in a great location This Hyatt is popular with large business groups and conventioneers, but it can be a nice hotel for tourists too. The lobby includes the trademark soaring atrium and a mediocre coffee shop, along with a decent bar. Rooms are small, and some are exposed to a lot of street noise, but some have great views toward the bay and/or bay bridge. The decor is a bit dated and could use an upgrade.I've stayed here several times in the past few years, and service has always been professional and compassionate.The location is great. It's right across from Foodie Heaven, the Ferry Building. An excellent breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack is just a short walk away. A BART (subway) stop is located directly in front on Market Street, and Yerba Buena Center or Union Sq are flat 15-minute walks away. Toward the Ferry Building, a vintage street car can transport you to the Fisherman's Wharf area, while a hilly walk in the other direction will take you to China Town or North Beach.Parking will cost you a small fortune (at last check I think it was over $40 a night).

<Content>The big Atrium hotel The atrium is the centerpiece in this hotel. Several years old now, it's still beautiful architecture. The rooms are OK - nothing fancy for this class of hotel. And the facitity feels a bit dated (some of the concrete walls don't do much for me). But the sliding doors on the room added a wonderful openness to the room and the view was pretty good. The location is good, and the F trolly line, BART and MUNI right at the hotel will get you everywhere. It's a good hotel but I wouldn't pay a premium.

<Content>Comfortable stay, very convenient! We're usually drawn by cozy, offbeat hotels, but we needed to book a room in SF with a week's notice and all the 'cozy' hotels were either too expensive or on the 'seedy' side of 'cozy'! So we gave Priceline a shot, and scored a room at the Hyatt Embarcadero at a good rate -- $92 per night. Positives: Proximity to the BART station -- you can't beat it. The BART train goes directly from the airport to the hotel and takes about 25 minutes... the Embarcadero BART station is literally next to the hotel's front door. Close to the California streetcar line and not a bad walk to the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area if you're into that....Comfort....the room/bed were very comfortable and clean -- we had a view of the harbor.Location for great, convenient food: don't miss the Ferry Building across the street for really good food...there's also a huge farmer's market on Saturday mornings. Drawbacks: Not many -- it's a long hike around to your room if you're on the opposite side from the elevators, but that's not really a big deal.Also, it's not super-close (at least not walkable) to restaurant areas, and things seemed to close down super-early in that neighborhood (we had trouble finding a reasonably-priced meal nearby at 9:30).All in all, though, we were very happy with our stay, especially at the price we paid!

<Content>Excellent! You won't be disappointed. Arrived Saturday of Memorial Day weekend for a 2 night stay. Picked the room up for $84 a night on Priceline, about 1/3 of the going rate. The location of the hotel is perfect, next to Embarcadero Bart station, Powell / Hyde Cable Car line and SF Muni bus terminal. Walking distance to Chinatown, Columbus Street (Little Italy). Took Muni to ATT Park for a Giants game. All very simple from this location. Check-in was simple, room was spacious and clean witha great view (7th Floor). In fact, room was oversized and beautiful with excellent furnishings. We skipped the $50 a day parking fee and found a lot a few blocks away for $11 (Jackson  Sansome Streets). Starbucks across the street too. Excellent shopping in Embarcadero area next door. Simply no complaints at all! Excellent and we would stay again.

<Content>Overpriced Yes, the Hyatt Regency has an impressive atrium. By definition, however, an atrium is empty space. The hotel itself was disappointing. In my room, the sink faucets did not work; neither did the overhead fan. The hotel did not feature any free wireless or Internet connection. Breakfasts were astonishingly expensive. Given what I paid, the experience was disappointing.

<Content>Nice enough, no SF charm I've stayed at this hotel a few times for fun and business. I never intentionally pick it, it is always a Hotwire/Priceline pick for 4-star hotel in the Embarcadero. It is a nice enough hotel, the rooms are comfy and big, the view is always beautiful, and the staff is friendly. The location can't be beat, right on the water, near the ferry terminal and the BART stop. We were upgraded for free to the club level and got free drinks/snacks and breakfast. Not bad! If you want a real, unique SF hotel experience this is not the place, rather corporate. But if you like consistency, this is a great place!

The rooms are most spacious, impecablly clean and the beds are sooo comfortable- We had breakfast each morning and the watiers/bus boys were all so accomodating..which made this a great experience.This hotel is located right on the cable car system and the electric trolleys are easy to access as well-It is right across the street from the Ferry Bldg which is a must see-You will not be disappointed with a stay at this Hyatt Regency-

Not so much party central, so maybe next time I'd stay in Union Square. Room was clean, mostly well kept. I had a great view, which I found kind of surprising because we booked through Priceline and I've heard that you get the lousiest room that way. But not here! We were able to check in a few hours before the stated time. The bar downstairs has good prices for a cocktail before dinner.

<Content>Nice hotel in great location We stayed at this property for four nights when we were attending a trade show. We were pleased with the room. It was nicely furnished and the bed was very comfortable, with a firm mattress, lots of pillows, and a down comforter. (At least it felt like a down comforter.) I've stayed in expensive hotels that had those flimsy blankets that you can buy at Walmart for $10, so I was impressed with the bedding. The concierge was very helpful with giving directions and other information, and there is a dedicated computer near the front desk where you can print your airline boarding passes for free. I was astounded at the parking rates (on a par with New York City) but luckily we didn't have a car. Internet access in your room is $10 per 24 hours, which is standard in many hotels, although I think expensive hotels such as this one should give it to you for free.The hotel is in an extremely convenient location. The metro stop is literally outside the front door, the bus and trolley stop are down the block (beware the trolley that is right outside the hotel; it's not a regular trolley but a tourist trolley that costs $5) and the ferry is a few blocks away. You can walk to a lot of shopping and restaurants, and there's a Starbucks across the street. The area isn't very busy at night, so be alert if you're walking. We were lucky to get this hotel on Priceline. I probably would pay full price to stay here if I could afford it.

<Content>Great! Used Priceline and got this for a total of $93 per night (including taxes). GREAT property for the money and RIGHT at the Embarcadero BART stop. If you are flying in and out of SFO just take the BART (San Fran subway and it is $3.95 each way). The hotel was beyond wonderful as far as niceness goes (for the money). I am pretty picky and they upgraded me to a fabulous regency suite (which was grandiose in style, view, and amenities).I also met the love of my life at this property, so it will always be a VERY special place to me.Take care and I hope that everyone loves this place as much as I did!!

Close to transportation. cable cars, trolleys, and trains. Close to everystore you can think of . Walking distance to so many places. We had starbucks coffee every morning across street and there is a little pastry coffee shop that sells rolls with scrambled eggs and ham for $3.00. Very reasonable to eat there. We were walking distance to ferry terminal where they have a farmers market tusday and weekends. Food in the terminal is fabulous and reasonable. You can pick up a bottle of wine, cheese fruit bread and they have an italian deli to pick up fresh cold cuts and subs. We were very happy to be there. the hotel itself is beautiful. Staff friendly. Main entrance is on 2nd floor be warned. Its a bit of a hike. Slept like a baby in the beds provided. We were given a view of the baybridge. We were able to open our window and look out . Beautiful.

<Content>overrated and overpriced My husband and I stayed here during a month-long trip all over the U.S. Honestly, we were underwhelmed. On the postive, the bed was amazingly comfortable and we got the best night's sleep of our trip. The view from the room was great, as was the location in SF.However, we have had better service at budget hotels. On our first night at the Hyatt, we went down to the lobby bar for some drinks and appetizers. The bar was VERY quiet- there were only a few tables occupied. Despite the fact that it was slow, and the fact that there were 5 (yes, 5) servers working at the time, it took 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order. Then, it took another 20 minutes for the waitress to bring us our drinks. When we looked up to see what was taking so long, we saw all the servers and bartender standing around talking. Our food came about 40 minutes after we ordered it. Nobody offered us any explanation of why things were taking so long.My husband works in the restaurant and hotel industry, so we are very understanding with waitstaff when we go out. But this was ridiculous- the service was absolutely appalling. On top of all that, it cost $50 per day to park our car at the hotel, and another $10 per day to use the internet. I understand that the parking rate is pretty typical for an upscale hotel in the city, but why are they charging for internet??? I can go to a La Quinta and get it for free!! As lovely as the accommodations are, the inflated cost of this hotel is not justified due to the below average customer service.

Balcony with sliding door and view of bay a pleasant surprise. Many great restaurants nearby.Minuses: Lots of cement in this dark, monolithic building, not warm or inviting. Staff reflects this - capable but terse, not particularly warm. In room guest services guide omits important details. Outrageous food prices in room service and atrium restaurant, even for a pricey city like SF. Tired breakfast buffet with limited offerings runs a staggering $26. At $228/night including taxes, there are better values in SF. But the location is hard to beat.

The ice skating rink right outside added that extra Xmas touch. And being right across the street from the Ferry Building is a bonus too. Great place for coffee and breakfast.My only complaint is the $48 a day parking. Ouch! There is a much more reasonable parking garage down the street if you do not want to pay this exorbitant price. SF parking is always expensive but this is really RIDICULOUS!Otherwise, I will be back again. But I won't use their parking again...thats for sure.

<Content>Great Central location - comfortable We stayed 3 nights at this hotel after flying in from Australia and recuperated from the flight well. The room was aged, but clean and well maintained, the beds were great.  Location of this hotel was great, the view excellent (water view) - Hyatt Guest room - accommodated 3 of us comfortably.Front line staff were a bit reluctant (may have been the Aussie accent). Breakfast was ordinary - better options around town that cost less.The location of the hotel allowed us to either walk or catch trams to explore San Francisco. We felt this was a good area and felt safe.If you're looking for a centrally located, comfortable and clean hotel then I'd recommend this hotel and we'd stay again.

<Content>Some nice features, good location I stayed here for one night last weekend and got a corporate rate for the room, which made it affordable; I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. The location is excellent, right outside the BART station and close to the Ferry Building (awesome bars, restaurants, and fabulous farmer's market on Saturday mornings) as well as part of the Embarcadero shopping complex. The hotel is massive, with one of those cheezy big-hotel atriums in the centre, although since it was Christmas it was decorated for the holidays and quite beautiful. I arrived late on Friday night after missing a flight; the front desk staff was efficient, but not friendly. I decided to work out, and the gym was quite good - it's open 24 hours with your key and I was the only one there. The room itself was fine, although the bathroom was TINY, and the walls were paper-thin (I could hear the women in the next room chatting as soon as they woke up, which was EARLY!) Not what you expect from an expensive hotel. Average furnishings  decor, but a nice big bed with soft sheets and lots of pillows, and a sliding door that opened to the outside, which was nice. Overall, a good but not great experience; I expected more considering what they normally charge for a room.

<Content>Really Liked! My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero on Nov. 19-21, 2006. We booked the hotel through priceline.com and got a rate of $80. I knew a hotel in this area would charge for parking so I figured that was a pretty good rate if I added in an estimated parking fee of $30. It turned out that the parking fee was $28.50 if we self-parked with no in-out priveleges and $49 if we valet parked, inc. in-out priveleges. This was told to us by the valet at the hotel when we drove up. We truly appreciated his candor and decided to self park since we expected to use the local transportation. The parking garage was just across the street and the next block over so it was not a problem. We requested and received a king size, non-smoking room with a partial view. It was on the 7th floor and we could see the Ferry Building and bay beyond it. There was also an outside ice skating rink behind the hotel that we could see. Our room was large, one of the largest hotel rooms I have been in. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was clean.Since we arrived at midnight, we did not know about the water wall in the lobby until the morning. The lobby was just as pretty during the day. The hotel had just been decorated for Christmas and the lobby was quite pretty with all of the hanging lights. The hotel is located across the street from the Ferry Building and the F Line stops in front of it. This street car takes you all along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf and then down to Market Street. There is also a trolley car line that runs in front of the hotel that goes to Chinatown. Hotel staff was very knowledgeable and there is a computer kiosk where you can print your airline boarding passes.I would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Nice Hotel, So So Location I recently spent the night at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero for a business conference. The actual hotel was beautiful, the rooms very comfortable, and the staff very friendly and helpful. I just wasn't very happy with the location. I usually enjoy shopping while in San Francisco. It is located next door to the Embarcadero Shopping Center, but there were only a few shops that I was interested in. The one advantage is there is a cable car stop right outside of the hotel that can take you to ChinaTown and over by Union Square.

<Content>Loved the Hyatt Have stayed at this hotel many times in the past. The hotel has an indoor feel inside the atrium and an airy feel once inside youre room. The hotel staff are and have always been nice, friendly and accomodating. Requested extra towels, bathroom amenities, room service, robe and was done-given accordingly. Never had any problem with them. This hotel now has their signature grand bed in ( some?) their guestrooms, I stayed on room 715, a little on the noisy side, ( 7th flr ) normally get a higher, bay / balcony view. If you happened to have drinks and dine at 13 Views, ask for Bonnie, shes very nice and friendly.Enjoy.

<Content>Give it a try ! Not as bad as the reviews make it seem. I read the other reviews by prior visits and was very concerned. So in effect my expectations were lowered a bit. But I was suprised. Yes, when it was built it was a showplace of the period. I loved looking at the architecture as the build had to be difficult. So I saw something different then others. The room was comfortable and in good shape, had a water for view and a balcony. Room service was ok. Nothing to write home about but I did not starve either. The bath was smaller than some hotels these days but not to small to worry about touching the shower curtain :) I would stay again.

<Content>Spectacular Views This was our first experience using Priceline and were very hesitant as to what we would get for the price we selected. WOW were we surprised and delighted. This hotel is fabulous in every respect but most particularly the view from the room: Oakland Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero. The location to the financial district makes it an excellent business hotel but it is walking distance to many wonderful areas for leisure travel.The only negative is the parking at $43 a night, discounted for hotel guests!

<Content>Good for business trips I have stayed at this hotel for several business meetings. The hotel has a nice atrium court with a cafe, bar and small market. The cable cars are right out outside of the lobby entrance and most rooms have unobstructed views of the San Francisco bay. This hotel is great for conferences, but I wouldn't stay here for a romantic weekend. The rooms are somewhat bland and there are better hotels in SF with more character (Mark Hopkins, Ritz, Orchard).

<Content>Loved it! I took my wife to San Francisco for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. The room was booked through Hyatt鈥檚 own website, which offered a pretty good deal at the time. At our request, we were given a room on the 17th floor, which was very quite. The bed and pillows were incredible. In fact, once we arrived home, we ordered two pillows. If you鈥檙e interested in purchasing the same pillows, you can purchase them from Pacific Coast Feather Company. Although we ended up with a city view room, it was still enjoyable. If you have an opportunity, try to have dinner at the hotel鈥檚 rotating restaurant. The views from the Equinox restaurant are incredible. However, the food is somewhat overpriced and nothing to write home about. Then again, you're paying for the view. As for the lobby... it's just beautiful. I've read all of the reviews regarding this hotel, especially the critical ones. All I can say is that some folks should just stay home and forget about traveling. Some people are just way too critical and will never be pleased with anything. This is a beautiful hotel with outstanding service.If you're looking to spend some time at a spectacular hotel, then you should certainly put this one on your list.

<Content>Location was great Location was great for tourist.... Cable car starts right outside the door and the Ferry building being across the street. Embarcadero buildings next door. Starbucks and a Walgreens across the street help make things convenient. Room wise is was a typical Hyatt room. We checked in late so we were on a low floor (4th Floor) since the hotel was sold out. Which wasn't bad at all.. the noise from the street didn't effect us at all... and somehow we got a handicap room so the bathrooms were extra large. Hotel was nice open atrium look and I would recommend having a drink at the bar equinox (great view and the rotation kinda throws you off but you get use to it). Overall a nice hotel to be in the central area of things and everything can be reached via public transit... either Bart, Cable, Bus, Ferry. Oh and don't bring a car ... the parking will be more then the cost of your room so I suggest taking the Bart into the hotel.... very easy or a cab (not during rush hour traffic or you'll pay) Best bet is the shuttle service or a car service. You won't need your car once you get into the city.

<Content>nice hotel, great location, felt "nickel and dimed" This hotel is the perfect location for a view of the bay, access to ferries and the Ferry Terminal Markets (which was our focus). We had a nice room on a high floor and it is not inexpensive. We were a bit taken-aback to find that parking is $50/night with tax and that they even charge $10/day for wifi access. These days almost everyplace offers free wifi ... we felt they were gouging us a bit.

<Content>'I left my heart ...' - thanks in part to Hyatt Regency This hotel is a gem! Stayed here for a Fri, Sat  Sun night in Aug 2006. Got it from Priceline at an extraordinarily good price (90). My room was on the 3rd floor and I had a partial view of the bay, which was great. Especially when there were fireworks on Friday night! The room itself was very large with a king bed, dresser with TV on a swivel (so you could watch it from anywhere in the room) a desk w/chair, an upholstered chair by the window and another nice comfy upholstered chair with ottoman and convenient reading light/table right next to it. There was a coffee maker and coffee/supplies in the room. Bathroom products were fab with a nice fresh scent - and replenished daily. King size bed was a dream - pillowtop mattress, loads of pillows and a feather comforter. Felt like I was falling into marshamallow fluff each night! You absolutely could not ask for a better located hotel. Right across from the newly renovated ferry building, with all the convenient public transportation right outside the door, including subway to airport and trolley car to Chinatown. Quite a few coffee shops and some fast food type places within steps of the hotel. Embarcadero center shopping (with all the standard chains) right up the street. Definitely go over to the farmers market at the Ferry building on Saturday if you are there. They also have Arts  Crafts booths each weekend right outside the hotel. It is such a breeze to have the ferry right across the street from the Hyatt, too. Just walk over and hop on to spend a day in Sausalito. There are a few nice restaurants within walking distance (reccomend Schroders on Front Street - for great beer and German food.) My stay at the fabulously located, highly appointed Hyatt was a good contributor to leaving my heart in San Francisco...

<Content>Nice Location, Nice Hotel We were sent here by the San Francisco Marriot when they overbooked their hotel. The Marriot paid for our room here. The Hyatt is a wonderful hotel and an architectural marvel. Our room was an executive suite located on the 12th floor with a fantastic view of the bay bridge and street fair below. The furniture in the room was somewhat worn out, but he bed was very nice and comfortable.The staff were extremely pleasant and professional, especially at the front desk and valet parking. We were in the area for Giants game and found this hotel to be a great location and within walking distance to ATT Park. A nice 20 minute walk along the waterfront. We would certainly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>One night stay - would have stayed longer, but ... We booked this hotel through Priceline - planning a one-night stay in order to visit the city museums. Since we live only about an hour and a half away by car, we often drive in to SF for a night or two. When we checked in, we were greeted in a very friendly manner by the desk clerk, who offered us the option of upgrading to a bay-view balcony room for $30. We decided to go for it, and we were given a non-smoking room on the 15th floor, which had just been renovated. Our room was lovely - great view from the balcony, and the bed was new and very comfortable, as were the linens (I absolutely loved the duvet-style bedcoverings), and even the carpeting appeared to have been recently replaced. Very nice. The only thing that marred the experience was that the balcony was littered with cigarette butts and spent matches. Obviously, whomever had been in the room previous to us had been a chain smoker - we counted 26 cigarette butts lying outside the room on the balcony. We were surprised that housekeeping apparently doesn't check or clean that area, as the room itself was immaculate, and there was no hint of smoking odors inside the room ... just the butts on the balcony.Bathroom was very clean and stylish. Source soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc. Towels were okay - not as plush as I would have expected. No coffee-maker in the room.Parking is expensive, but probably not much more more than most hotels in SF. There is an additional charge for in-and-out privilages, which we thought was a bit excessive, bringing our parking charge (with tax and tips) to over $50 for one night. We enjoyed our stay enough that we decided on a whim to extend our time in the city an extra night. When we inquired at the front desk - with the same clerk who had been so jovial when we checked in - as to the possiblity of staying an additional night, we were abruptly told that was not a possibility, because we had booked through a third party. (Priceline) There was no hint of , I'm sorry, we cannot honor the price you paid, but let me see what the rate would be to stay another night, which is what we had expected. The hotel did not appear to be very full, either. The clerk just didn't seem at all interested in having us book there for another night. It was kind of strange, after the guy had been so friendly and outgoing the day before ... we ended up booking a room at the Hilton (for substantially less than even our Priceline rate), and stayed another night in the city after all.Overall, we liked the Hyatt Regency - at the Priceline rate, which was $99 (plus tax and upgrade and parking it was closer to $220 total) - but probably wouldn't stay there for the usual rack rate, as there are better locations if you are not in the city on a business trip.

<Content>Great hotel, great location for moms and kids I took my 10-year old son to SF for a weekend in late July to see a Giants game. This hotel was suggested by travelocity writers as a great choice, and they were right. A weekend AAA discount rate (including breakfast) sealed the deal. We arrived early Friday a.m. and expected to check our bags or be given a smallish room, but we were pleased to be immediately given a large, deluxe double with partial bay views. The room was up to Hyatt standards (upgraded bedding and decor, ample furniture) as was the lobby. I had assumed fisherman's wharf would be the best location with a kid in tow, but this was far better : away from the noise and crowds, close proximity to the things we wanted to do, and the hotel met our every need and more. There is a computer center available for a nominal fee if your kid needs to check his fantasy team (would be nice if they offered it free to hotel guests). There are plenty of family-friendly stores and eateries (Noah's bagels, a Walgreens for a sports drink) right outside the front door if you need them along with upscale shopping if you're inclined. The ballpark is a 5-minute muni ride or a 20-minute walk along the embarcadero. The Metreon videogame.IMAX complex is a short hop down Market street (though take a taxi back if you go at night) Easy bus ride to fisherman's wharf . BART station is literally across the street - take it to/from the airport for $5.15. Front desk was very friendly and helpful when we needed bags held for a late flight, left keys in the room, etc. as was the concierge, however, ignore their recommendations to take a taxi everywhere - walk or use the Muni, at least during the day. No pool (usually a must-have for kids), but you don't even miss it - too much to see and do. If you need water time, take a bay cruise under the Golden Gate bridge. If you are going to alcatraz, be sure to book ahead of time. We didn't and missed out, but that's another reason to come back.This was a great weekend at a great hotel. My son loved the place, and my teenage daughter would love it too. It was doable for us because of the special rate (under $200/night including tax), but if money is not an object, splurge and stay here.

<Content>Cold  Stayed three nights on business.First, the positives.1. Location. Hotel is next to trolley station and close to public transportation. Cabs are right outside. No need to rent/bring a car. Easy walking distance to a lot of great restaurants as well.2. View. My bayview room had a very nice view of the water. Some rooms clearly had spectacular views. Others obviously didn't. But if you have a water view, it's special.3. Service. The service was generally good. No waits or lines, even though this very large hotel was hosting a convention. However, I couldn't escape the plastic smile syndrome. Everyone said  did all of the right things, but I couldn't get over the feeling that I was nothing but a number among a very large number of people.And now for the negatives.1. Hotel Decor. You either love or hate the lobby. I agree with the reviewer who described it as 70s modern and cavernous. To me, it only added to the cold and impersonal qualities of the hotel.2. Rooms. Nothing special. They are clean but have that somewhat dingy/not remodeled look. The sink area (outside of the bathroom) had been redone but they forgot the bath. It's tiny and in need of updating. You sort of want to get in and out of the tub/shower as quickly as possible. It really looks like a Motel 6. Amenities are bare minimum and mine weren't replaced for 2 days. Also, my room was oddly laid out. Sitting in the desk chair, you could not see the TV. Sitting in the lounge chair you couldn't see the TV. You either had to rearrange furniture or sit on the bed to watch TV. And, some rooms are a LONG way from the elevators.3. Speaking of Elevators . . . there aren't enough and they are tiny. If two people with luggage get in the elevator, no one else can join them.4. Club Level. Don't do it. You get continental breakfast, which is okay when they are prompt at replenishing food (sometime yes, sometimes, no). However, there aren't nearly enough seats in the lounge. As a result, one morning people had to eat their breakfast standing up. The evening hors d'hoeuvres are weak and all service ends at 8 p.m. Soft drinks are free; alcohol will cost you (apparently due to CA law). 5. Internet. No wired service; only wireless for $10. I know a lot of folks mentioned problems with noise. I had none. Not sure if this was because I was on a high floor or if the crowd was quieter than usual.Overall, I came away with two impressions. First, they were trying to nickel  dime you to death. (Water in room is $6; fees in club lounge; they serve you coffee and OJ immediately upon being seated at breakfast -- before you find out it will set you back $8.50 + tax/tip). Second, it was just another huge hotel and you, the guest, are just another traveler passing through. I've stayed at several other SF hotels and, if I came again, would stay at one of those rather than return to the Hyatt. The experience wasn't terrible, it just wasn't terribly good.

<Content>It was a magical mini-vacation We went to the Hyatt over Memorial Day, a perfect time since there were no crowds anywhere. The staff at the Hyatt were exceptionally nice and helpful. My husband asked for a room with a good view, and we got #1013 which looks directly onto the Ferry Building, The Bay Bridge and the bay. We had lovely sail boats by day and twinkling lights at night. The room was beautifully decorated with six or seven different textures and patterns which all worked together perfectly. The bed was super comfortable. We will definitely return any chance we get.

<Content>Pack your earplugs I agree with many of the recent reviewers that this hotel falls short of a 4-star ranking. The staff are pleasant and polite and check-in was fast and efficient. While my room was clean, with contemporary furniture and a comfortable bed, there was nothing special about the decor, the towels were paper-thin (like the kind you usually find in Motel 6 and the like), and the shower was somewhat dated with dirty grout and old fixtures. The building itself leaves much to be desired. It is a very large and impersonal structure that appears to have been built no later than the late 1970s when stark concrete was in vogue. The lobby atrium area is very dark and has the feel of a concrete cave. Also, the elevators are woefully inadequate. There is a single bank of elevators on one side of this very large building; it took about 3 minutes at a brisk pace to walk from my room to the elevators. Once there, one often has to wait for 2 or 3 elevators because they are overcrowded. The worst thing about this hotel, by far, is the noise, from both inside and outside. I was unable to fall asleep until after 2:00 a.m. due to (1) very loud music over loudspeakers in the hotel's atrium outside my door (apparently designed to set the proper mood for the hotel bar regardless whether the hotel guests might be trying to sleep), and (2) noise and general rowdiness from outdoor patrons of a bar adjacent to the hotel. The atrium music stopped at midnight. When I complained to the front desk about the loud music from the bar just beneath my window, I was told they had previously had complaints about noise from that bar but that there was nothing they could do about it. I was just told that last call at the bar was 1:45 a.m. and that it should quiet down after that! It is no exaggeration to say that this supposedly 4-star hotel had the feel of a cheap dive over some honky-tonk bar in the middle of nowhere. I have never experienced such a noisy hotel in all my years of traveling. To be fair to the hotel, however, I must say that I did obtain this room via Priceline and it's possible the front desk clerk consciously gave me the noisiest room in the least convenient location and that, if you paid full price, you might get something quieter or more convenient.All in all, there are much better choices in San Francisco at this price point. If you can get a room here for a very modest price, and if you bring earplugs, the hotel is OK, but do not pay anything close to full price or expect a 4-star hotel or else you will be very disappointed.

<Content>Convenient and Nice The hotel lobby still impresses me no matter how many times I've been there. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff were all professional and courteous. The Embarcadero has been revitalized and the Hyatt is in a prime location to take advantage of the changes. BART/Muni/Cable Car (California St.)/Streetcars are all within steps from the hotel. I felt is was a really great value. My only complaint was that the parking was expensive at $49/night. I am already planning another stay in SF and will definitely look into getting a room at the Hyatt.

<Content>Noisy We paid to upgrade to a view room with balcony. Next time (if there is one) I think I'll skip it. We called housekeeping when we arrived because there was bird poop on the patio chairs and the glasses were dirty. We left before housekeeping arrived and they cleaned the chairs, but left the dirty glasses.The bed was so, so, but not 4 stars. The worst part was the noise from next store. We could hear them talking and (everything else they did!) as if they were in the same room with us. I guess the pass through door was the weak link in the acostics.We weren't even pleased with the public areas. The giant attrium and vast expanses of concrete were so 60's and dated. It felt dark and cavernous like. I will avoid this hotel in the future.

<Content>Worn and outdated rooms await you at this hotel As a Hyatt Diamond member who has stayed at Hyatts thought out the world this has to be one of the worse. The lobby is nice, with a decent bar with nice views of the bay bridge and ferry buidling. The service is what you expect at a large scale tourist/convention hotel. For a four star hotel the rooms are horrible, they are outdated, worn looking and in deperate need of renovation. I booked a executive suite, and it was far from execuitive. The comforter on the bed was old and worn looking, the mattress was very uncomfortable, the windows were filthy, and the amenities were the basic hotel ones. Most rooms in this hotel do not have the Hyatt Grand Bed, just old worn ones. I've seen better quality at a 2 star hotel. This hotel basicly cateres to tourist and large conventions, if your looking for quality I would stay somewhere else. A the current rates offered you can get more for your money elsewhere.

<Content>Top Notch Staff and Location. I've stayed here three times over the past 25 years. The lobby is still striking, the embarcadero location is near everything (and across from the ferry building), and the staff is professional, courteous, and they all went out of the way for us- front desk, valet, bellman... The rooms were above average. The bedding and toiletries were very good, but the sliding bathroom door didn't cut it. I paid $100 on priceline and felt like I got the deal of a lifetime. Problem- parking was $49/day!!!!!! Shame on them. They ONLY overnight option we found was down the street for $28. Still, I'll definately stay here again.

<Content>Past its best I was looking forward to my first trip to San Fran and decided to choose what I thought was an upmarket hotel for our four night stay. I was wrong. The Hyatt Regency has seen better days and is well overpriced compared to other City Hotels.The service at check in was average and they were more intersted in getting me to upgrade to a Bay view room and pay for breakfast in advance. I did this to find that I could see the Bay as long as I leaned over the balcony and looked to my right - not a Bay view from the room. The room itself was very drab and tired. The patio doors were loose with worn seals, the carpet was stained and faded and the bedcover was torn and very old. The items in the minibar were expensive including the unchilled water for $6. A Hotel like this should provide at least one bottle of water free of charge - not the Hyatt Regency. A four star Hotel - I think not!! - plenty of others to choose in San Fran avoid this one.

<Content>Rooms are definately not 4* The outside of the hotel is beautiful. The lobby is breathtaking. We had a wonderful view of the bay bridge from our room and right outside the door. We stayed on the regency floor and enjoyed the services. And the best thing about this hotel : LOCATION! If you plan on staying here and don't mind the crummy rooms, then don't ever rent a car! The street cars and Trolleys are literally on your doorstep. But I must say the furnishing in the rooms were a complete disappointment. Holes in footrest and comforter??? Come on Hyatt!! I stayed at a crowne plaza hotel the day before and enjoyed plush furnishings. I understand this is a business hotel, hence the Spartan decorations but seriously, torn and aging furniture is an eyesore and not worth the price. On the plus side, the staff were excellent and prompt in meeting our needs.

The hotel is close to Muni/BART train stationand is quite safe even late at night.ROOM: The room that was offered to me was anon-smoking room in the 9th floor. The roomwas stuffy and bathroom was cramped in space.The carpet and furniture was old and worn.FACILITIES: The room has high speed wired internet access available for an extra $10 for 24 hours. Thehotel itself has a cold feel.To SUM UP, this is just an OK hotel. You could chooseto stay if you get a real good deal. Otherwise I'd recommend shopping around for better value.

<Content>Very Satisfying Stay We were in San Francisco for business and this was the conference hotel, so we stayed here with expectations no more or less than what you usually get with a large convention facility. We were delighted.First of all, we took BART from SFO airport and the stop is indeed right at the hotel's front door. I was a little hesitant to take BART because I didn't want to be lugging suitcases down a sidewalk at night, but we literally walked just a few steps and we were inside. We were a little confused as the lobby area is one flight up from the street level, but we soon got our bearings and went to check in.The staff were extremely welcoming and pleasant to deal with. They upgraded us to the Regency Floor (16th Floor) without our requesting it. The room was large and very pleasant with a balcony with double doors that you could really open and step outside for an incredible view of the bay and Ferry Building. We were treated to a complimentary breakfast each morning which was surprisingly good with fresh fruit and a coffee machine which dispensed Starbuck's Coffee one cup at a time -- I mean, it ground the beans and literally brewed one cup at a time. The Ferry Building and adjacent open areas was full on the weekend of artisans and people with fresh produce. We ended up one night eating on our balcony with fresh bread, cheese, tomatoes, raisins, and a killer bottle of Pinot Noir from the market shops.I've got to give one or two criticisms here, else someone may think that this review is exaggerated. First of all, the halls from the elevators are very long and it does take a while to get around. The hotel is large, though, so I suppose that is expected. As we walked to our room, the end of the hall was a picture window with a gorgeous view of the bay. I told my husband I felt like I was on a cruise ship as I walked with that view in front of me.The other mild criticism is that the concierge gave us wrong information regarding taking a bus to Haight Street. It was the weekend and she told us to catch Bus No. *** (can't remember the number) which stopped right outside. Yes, Bus No. *** did stop right outside - Monday through Friday - but not on the weekends. We got a little frustrated, and ended up in a cab which was expensive, but even that worked to our advantage as it started raining as we were being driven to our destination.All in all, I highly recommend this hotel for any reason - business or pleasure. The staff (except for the ditzy concierge) could not have been more helpful, attentive, or pleasant, and we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A very pleasant stay A recent conference at this hotel prompted my stay and since the room was discounted to $229/night I decided to stay here rather than have to stay elsewhere and walk back to this hotel for the daily meetings. I ended up with a handicapped room as all of the other nonsmoking rooms were taken, and this allowed for a more roomy accomodation as well as a bigger bathroom, so I can't fairly comment on what a normal sized room might be like. The room was extremely clean, as was the bathroom, and had fabulous city views and a short walk down the hallway allowed for incredible views of the Bay Bridge and the Ferry Building. Interior of the hotel is very modern and spacious with a well stocked gift shop and very decent restaurants/bars. The exercise room was very well equipped and showed movies while you work out. The location of the hotel is extremely convenient-very close to the cable car stop as well as BART and Muni bus stops and within walking distance of the piers and Fisherman's Wharf. The only drawbacks were that the parking is horribly expensive (valet charges $40/day plus a $5 parking tax and if you self-park you get charged $30 each time you re-enter the parking garage) and there is no swimming pool. Overall, though, a very nice stay and I would definitely stay here again for the right price.

<Content>Excellent Hyatt I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero in San Francisco for one night in March 2006. I was only there for one night before moving to another hotel for the remainder of my stay. The location of the hotel is perfect, especially for people using public transportation. I flew in and out of Oakland airport and the Embarcadero BART stop is only four from the Coliseum/Oakland Airport BART station. When you emerge from the BART station the Hyatt is right there above your head. The room was enormous (especially for San Francisco). I had asked for a high, quiet room and was given one on the 12th floor of the Drumm Street side of the hotel. The room and ammenities were excellent. The shower/tub, toilet room is separate from the sink area and is very small. The water pressure in the shower is great with easily adjustable flow and direction. I would stay at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero again, especially if I was able to secure a great rate (I had a senior discount this time).

<Content>good business hotel close to the embarcadero great hotel at a great location. at the rates i got from priceline -- it was a steal! it's primarily a business hotel and is next door to the financial district. but it's also walking distance to great dining, sight-seeing and bar-hopping. if you are too tired out to go out, try the equinox bar at the penthouse. it's the only revolving restaurant in san francisco and offers great views of the city. stayed at a city view room, but even that had a great view of the bay bridge. checked in on a friday night for an awesome rate, woke up saturday to experience the embarcadero weekend market. overall, a wonderful experience, highly recommended, will come back!

<Content>Public areas are 4*, but not the rooms We just returned from a $70 Priceline stay at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero. At this price, the hotel was a great value. Some thoughts: The public areas are 4* all the way, but our room on the 3rd floor had 2* furnishings and just wasn鈥檛 up to basic business class standards 鈥?let alone 4*. It was clean, but bathroom counter had markings on it, interior of room was drab, design was very outdated, cheap linens, tacky comforter, not enough furniture (room needed a nice chair  ottoman), etc. We parked at 4 Embarcadero Center for $28 overnight, which is a bargain compared to what the hotel charges. We didn鈥檛 eat at the restaurants, so I can鈥檛 comment on that. The other challenge with this property is that it's a l-o-n-g walk to Union Square, which is our favorite shopping spot. So, I probably won鈥檛 be bidding on this zone again for that reason. All in all, this hotel was a good value for what we paid, but compared to the SF Hilton or SF Marriott, for example, this property just does not measure up to 4* standards. At best, it deserves the 3* rating that it used to have. By the way, the front desk staff was excellent! The nice guy who helped us easily accommodated our request for a king, non-smoking room. We had a nice view of the Transamerica Tower, so I can鈥檛 complain about that either. There is just no way that our room had that 鈥渢op-level amenities and furnishings鈥?that it should have had to deserve the 4* rating.

<Content>I'll stay elsewhere in the future I chose this hotel because of it's location - it's convenient to the Embarcadero and Financial District. I upgraded to a bay view room. The only way to see the bay from my room was to lean out over the balcony. I had to drape a towel over the furniture on the balcony it was so dirty.There were water stains and paint peeling from the ceiling, and stains on the carpet. The rest of the hotel is very dated as well.Front desk staff were very aloof, didn't seem to care about customers. Definitely not worth the money.

<Content>Great Hotel/Perfect Location We just got back from a stay at this hotel and have to admit we were pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it was (in spite of several touchy reviews we have read). We went for a conference and after reading a few negative reviews had considered staying elsewhere, however we are extremely glad we decided to 'tough it out'at the conference hotel. The hotel was great, and the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. We asked for a room with a view, high floor, and near the elevator (based on other reviews). The pleasant reception desk person told us that view rooms were not near the elevator, so we opted to go for the view. We had a 15th floor room with an outstanding view of the Bay and Oakland Bay bridge/Ferry building. It might have been better, but we're not sure how.As others have mentioned, the location really makes this a top choice. We had purchased the City Pass on line which gave free access to all Muni Transport as well as a number of museums (very worthwhile). We also purchased AirBart Tix on line to get us to the hotel. The Bart station is right outside the door of the hotel. Also, the famous cable cars, restored trolleys on the F line (access to the Piers as well as all the way up Market to the Castro), Muni underground, and all kinds of bus lines are literally right outside the door! The location cannot be beat.And a great meal was had at Chow at the Church St. station on both the trolley and the underground.And across the street is the Ferry Building with all kinds of shops and restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the Hog Island Oyster Co.(the owner was on line in front of us and refused to 'pull rank'; he even allowed us to take a better located table!). Also, Cowgirl Creamery Cheese is not to be missed.Do not be afraid of this hotel -- it will serve you well (OK, the pillows ae a little flat.).

<Content>Reservations not honored*REGENCY FLOOR*problems w/beds We booked Nov 1st 2 rooms on the Regency Level-indicated that we needed 2 beds in each room--as we have a family. This was noted and confirmed. Upon our arrival we were given rooms w/1 king bed in each--and they told us (a lie) that this level only had king beds in the room. Untrue. Next they said they were out of cots-until I called again and spoke to the manager and told him that 2 large boys could NOT share a bed--and we needed at least 1 cot. We did get 1 cot--A basic apology was given-but no attempt to find another room w/ 2 double beds. We will never stay there again since they failed to accomodate us. The Regency Club does offer a breakfast--with inadequate tables, chairs, and service personnel to keep the area neat. Basically, not worth the extra charge. If you stay there CALL BEFORE and make then guarantee the room arrangements! Otherwise a family may have to share 1 bed.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt My family (including husband, brother, sister in law and 17 year old nephew) just got back from a 5 night stay at the Hyatt and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and the city. We had all been to SF several times previously but never as a group. We had a great package deal on Hotwire and chose this hotel because of its easy location to public transportation. We took BART from the airport to the hotel and had an easy time. Check in was a bit complicated because both rooms were under one name, but once resolved we had nice rooms on the 10th floor. Our room with King bed had a great view of the harbor...my brother's room with 2 double beds had a city view. Both rooms were fine as far as bedding and mattresses go. There was no torn carpet or dirty bathrooms and service was good. We had bought a city pass for $42(highly recommended) and used it for a boat tour, several museums and unlimited use of muni transportation. People were extra friendly and helped us with directions when needed. We rode the cable cars and buses all over and managed to do a lot in spite of almost constant rain. We rented a car for the day to go to Napa (there is a Budget car rental in the hotel and we could return it any time that evening to the valet). All in all it was a great family time and we had no real complaints. The hotel is fine unless you are paying full price. (most hotels are not worth rack rate!)

<Content>Not Up to Expectations My husband's company was hosting a Christmas Party at a restaurant at one of the SF Piers. Decided to stay at the Hyatt because it was walking distance to the party. Being a Hyatt Passport member I booked a Fab Friday rate on the official Hyatt website which included free valet parking and free appetizer at the lounge. The Fab Friday room rate was $140 for a standard room. We opted for the regency club suite for $240 for the big night out. I took BART into the city to meet my husband. If I would have taken the right BART escalator up to street level I wouldn't have even had to cross the street. Very convenient. Check in was quick. I was presented with an envelope that had coupons for the free appetizer and a letter noting that I would receive free valet parking with the Fab Friday rate. A reviewer has already described the suite quite accurately and provided pictures so I won't go into a description, but for a suite I have to say that the bed was no better than a bed in a one star motel. That bed was rock hard. Just a scratchy flat sheet thrown over the thin mattress. What was regency club about that bed. No pillow top mattress, no comforter, no upgraded linens, no turn down service. We did order room service when we got back from the company party. Room service was fast and food was good. The ice cream was still frozen too. The surprise came the next morning when I previewed my bill via the t.v. The rate was suppose to be $240 but they were charging me $299. I called down to the front desk and brought it to their attention. The front desk person told me that I was being charged $299 because I upgraded to a suite. No, I explained the rate of $240 that I had on my printed comfirmation was for a suite. She put me on hold and never came back. After being on hold for almost ten minutes another clerk came on the phone and I told him about the rate descrepancy. He didn't argue with me and agreed to reduce the rate to $240. I went down to the front desk and picked up a copy of the bill just to be sure. One of the reasons I reserved the room on the official Hyatt website was so that I would get the Hyatt gold passport points. I was reading the bill on the ride home and there was an asterisk next to the $240 rate. The asterisk meant that the rate was not eligible for Hyatt gold points. That wasn't mentioned when I booked the room. That fact wasn't noted in fine print in the letter I received at check in. Nice. Booked on their own website and didn't get any points. Don't think I'll be staying there again.

<Content>Great stay in San Fran! We really liked the hotel...when we arrived, they didn't have any non-smoking regular rooms available for us, so we upgraded to a suite with a bay view for another $15/night. We were there for 3 nights...parking was expensive, but we only had the rental car there for the first night before we returned it. It was a bit far of a walk to all the touristy things, but manageable. We ate at the restaurant on the top floor one night (reservations recommended) which spins to get a complete look at the city - good food and we had been given coupons at the front desk on check in, so all in all not too expensive of a meal...clean, nicely taken care of...we had a wonderful time!

<Content>Not 4-star quality-but thoroughly enjoyable I just returned from a short weekend stay with a friend. GREAT location, we were able to walk to Union Square and SBC Park, but this is a rather long walk for most. Plenty of available cabs and public transporation from the hotel if you are not up to the walk. We self-parked for $28/day at 3 Embarcadero (hotel is 5 Embarcadero) The wait for valet at the hotel can be up to 45 minutes, and they charge about $40/day. We were allowed to check in to our 10th floor room several hours early. The room was clean with newer furniture. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Our room overlooked Drumm Street, facing away from the Bay, with no balcony. The sliding doors did open to let in fresh air, however. It was noisy, and we awoke before 8am to 2 ladies with megaphones protesting something or other. For about 20 minutes they would alternate shouting 1-2-3-4 something something about Al Gore 5-6-7-8 something something, negotiate! Annoying, and nothing was done to stop them. The ice machine was WAAAAAY on the other side of the building and the hallways were quite narrow so this could prove problematic for those with mobility issues. There is a charge for emptying the honor bar and filling it with your own groceries. We did not do this, of course, but I have never seen a hotel charge for this in the past. We ate at the revolving restaurant (Equinox) because we were given 50% off meal coupons. It took us a while to figure out that you cannot get to the Equinox from the 10th floor. We finally ended up going down to the lobby level and taking the express elevator to the restaurant. Do not go here for the food-you are paying for the view. Our seafood pasta dishes were 30$ each, before the discount. It is pretty hard to mess up pasta, but the seafood was not the freshest and the heat was not evenly distributed throughout. Great for shopping at the Ferry Building-great farmer's market several days a week. The christmas ice rink is right there, and it is a quick easy walk to Chinatown. The lobby is still pretty impressive and deocorated for the holidays. Overall, we were happy with what we got for the price ($99/night) and I would stay again, but this is certainly NOT a 4-star hotel and it is not posh nor luxurious, but certainly worth a try if you can get it under 100 a night.

<Content>Four-star rating undeserved I agree--priceline should reduce the rating to 3-star. I received a price of $80 per night, and it was also much farther than I had expected, hoping for something closer to Union Square without getting near the Tenderloin. The location was okay, though, and the Ferry Building and transportation were great. View was gorgeous, room service was quick.Now to the bad stuff....The room, despite having been remodeled maybe in the last 5-10 years, was in bad shape. Peeling wallpaper, leaking toilet, stains and holes in the armchair (the cushions actually were several shades darker in the places people normally sit), and worst, bloodstains on the pillow. Yes, that's right--well washed and dried, but blood nonetheless. We grabbed a pillow from the closet which looked fairly clean, and threw the other one in a corner.I know we could have gone to the front desk and complained and would likely have been moved to a better room, but how much better could it have gotten? Besides, it was crowded and Thanksgiving and we were exhausted. So, overall, the quality was akin to a Motel 6, but the location, price, and view were favorable when compared to other area hotels.

<Content>Depends what you want We had mixed emotions about our stay at this hotel. There was nothing terribly wrong, but it also didn't seem to be a very good value for what it cost. I did not go through Priceline and get $80-$90 like many seem to here, and I probably would have found this hotel to be a good value at that price. Location is outstanding if you are avoiding renting a car and paying the outrageous parking fees. It is right at a BART station and the beginning of the California st cable car line. Many bus routes stop within 2-3 blocks. The Ferry building is right across the street with neat shops and restaurants. Access to the wharf areas was an easy trolley ride away or a comfortable 20-30 minute walk (over flat terrain) if you are looking for a pleasant walk.Rooms and amenities are very standard business-focused hotel issue. The deck was nice as the weather was very good when we were there and it was a pleasant place to sit and read. The only noise issues were from very loud motorcycles that seem to cruise endlessly down the Embarcadero into the very wee hours of the morning during weekends. Front desk service was very helpful and quick. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants - too many good places to eat in SF to do that.Overall a fine experience, but not special enough to justify the cost.

<Content>no better than low cost holiday inn We stayed in this hotel early October. Luckily we only paid $85 a night through priceline. This is not a four star hotel at this point. The location is fine, lobby very nice but the rooms are not worth full price. The bedding was terrible, just a loose top sheet thrown over the mattress, the towels in the bathroom were worn, thin and scratchy. The bathroom was tiny and cramped. Amenities were a joke, only shampoo and conditioner was given, had to ask for body lotion, shower cap, etc. which were given when asked. Lighting in the room was terrible, Overall, would not stay there again unless the price was really cheap. Location is fine, subway and cable cars are right outside the entrance, but if you want to go downtown and walk, quite a distance. Priceline should not give this a four star rating.

<Content>Great Experience My husband was attending a conference at the hotel, and I went along for the sightseeing. We arrived at 10pm and were given keys to our room on the third floor. When we arrived at the room, the housekeeper was just beginning to clean the room. We returned to the front desk where a very friendly staff member apologized, and immediately upgraded our room to a suite on the 7th floor, at no extra charge to us. We were very impressed by the size of the rooms, and had no complaints. The decor was updated, and the bathrooms large and nicley decorated. I especially enjoyed the jacuzzi in the bedroom bath, although I did have some problems with the controls at first. We had a balcony in both the living area and the bedroomin which we liked having the doors open to enjoy the fresh air coming in. We were particularly impressed with the quietness of the hotel. It was full the three nights we were there, and never once heard noised in the rooms, or loudness in the hotel itself. The hotel lobby is unique and nicely furnished. The glass elevators were quick to pick us up, and smooth to ride. They added a nice touch to the lobby. We had bellboys hold our luggage until our redeye flight, and found them to be as friendly and accomodating as the rest of the staff we had met. We would recommend the hotel to everyone, and would consider returning if we ever have the chance

<Content>Poor service high price This is a big hotel with some splendid views, but its size is part of its problem. With so many guests, some services were well below average. Everything seems to take a long time: whether its getting your car out of the exorbitant valet parking, or just waiting for an elevator. Upon check in our room was dirty with glasses from the previous guest. It took an hour for us to get our luggage, maybe not a problem for some, but we were supposed to meet friends and this wait caused us to be late. I called the concierge on two occasions, and they were less than helpful ; one occasion they were so busy discussing someone鈥檚 outfit on the Emmys they couldn鈥檛 be bothered to help me. If you are excited to be staying at a hotel with a kitschy revolving bar, get there quick, it closes down very early. I will say that the room was very quiet, unusual for such a large businesspersons hotel. The only other bright spot was the courteous and knowledgeable doorman. Although the location is good, given a choice, I won鈥檛 be back to the Hyatt Regency.

<Content>Not quite a four-star We spent a night at this hotel after staying at the Omni. The Hyatt Regency is bigger and the main lobby is very impressive. Room is fine but the bathroom is very outdated -- beige tiled walls with black marble floor, not really something you see from a four-star hotel. Service is impersonal as this hotel is for business travelers. The best thing is the view of the Bay Bridge from our room. Probably won't go back.

<Content>Cool Hotel-great location I was searching for a hotel in San Francisco on Expedia when I decided to roll the dice with Priceline...My $80.00 bid was accepted by the Hyatt at the Embarcadero. At first, I was a little upset that I hadn't landed a trendier boutique hotel as I'm really not a chain-hotel type of person. Upon arrival at the Hyatt however, I was presently surprised to find a totally modern, architectually interesting hotel in a fantastic location of the city. Upon check-in, we requested a room on a high floor and were given a spacious room on the 12th floor overlooking the Bay, complete with a large patio. The room was stylish and understated; lovely framed photographs, comfortable overstuffed chair with ottoman and a comfortable bed. The mini bar was stocked with lots of goodies, but for those interested in saving a little $, head to the Walgreens across the street for sodas, beer, wine, chips etc. Parking is expensive, but there are a number of lots available that are more afordable (if you don't mind parking your own car.) Tons of shops in the area and the close proximity to BART, the MUNI and cable cars makes it incredibly easy to get around town. I would def. recommend this hotel and will stay here again on my next visit!

<Content>wondeful hotel!!!! the best location and....... I just want to let people know that this is a wonderful hotel. This hotel is not only beautiful but it is in a Great location!. I rented this hotel for my parents  little brother for their first trip out to the west coast. I recieved a awesome rate from priceline 80.00 dollars a night for a hotel that costs 250.00 per night. The hotel staff is very nice and always helpful. The rooms are clean most views are nice. The hotel was booked for the entire weekend but there was no loud noise or traffic through the hotel. This hotel treated my family very well and made them feel very comfortable. I read a few review's of this hotel (on this site) and most people give this hotel a good to great review. There are a couple people who wrote reviews that just needed something to complain about so they complained about the PILLOWS. This is the stupidist thing i have ever heard. Yes the pillows are soft but all you have to do is call the front and have them brings u extra pillows. On a score of 1 thru 10 this hotel is deff a 8 or 9.

<Content>Wonderful View First off, check in was awesome, no line, no wait etc.Had reservations for Club level, balcony room.Room was on the 16th level, nice sized, balcony was alright, 2 chairs and a table. Shower/bath was small, updated shower head but would have been nice if it was higher, had to bend over to get head wet (i'm 6'1)Got this room mainly for the club level opportunity of the lounge in the evening and breakfast.I was disappointed to find out that alcoholic drinks had to be paid for in the lounge, and only non alcoholic drinks were free. (I had figured that this was going to be like Embassy suites were all the drinks were free no matter what they were, this was a disappointment) They had very little in the way of appetizers as well. The bed was nice (nothing special, no special sheets or pillows), you could hear the people walking upstairs in their room on the 17th floor and occasionally you could hear the plumbing from other rooms. As far as location it was an excellent jumping off point, to explore the city.I wouldn't pay full price for the room again which was over 200 with AAA discount. oh and as far as the continental breakfast in the lounge, it was ok, it consisted of yogurt, juices, coffee, fruit, banana bread, lemon pound cake, english muffins, toast (although the toaster seemed to be broken at the time) Enough to fill you up, but again nothing like what embassy suites offers to all their guests. I just wish there was an embassy suites in the city.over all impression It was a decent hotel but for the money I wouldn't pay for the club level again, it wasn't worth it.

<Content>Pleasant stay We stayed at the Hyatt in July 2005. The architecture of the lobby is impressive and perhaps the best feature of the hotel. THe staff is very accomodating and polite. We checked in around 12am and were given a room with a view of the city, which was nice but being in san francisco, we really wanted a view of the bay. THe staff at the front desk suggested to call back in the AM to see if any bay views were available. We lucked out and got a room with a bay view for the rest of our stay. Both rooms were quite clean. Beds were very comfortable. THe shower and hot/cold knobs were a bit confusing to adjust---some guests even called up front desk for a tutorial. Things to beware of: the restaurant in the lobby is quite pricey (as expected) and be alert if you go--dont open the bottled water on the tables unless you are prepared to pay 6 bucks for it. (there's a clear sticker price over the top-- that is easily missed). A good spot for breakfast is the cafe across the street. Secondly, this isnt NYC, most restaurants were closed after 9-10pm. The Chinese restaurant inthe adjacent shopping mall is quite good but also expensive. THe Italian one, one flight up is just expensive and not very palatable. Best features: view, Location to the embarcadero, and proximity of bart/cable cars. we would come here again for a good deal. ITsnot really worth more than 200 a night.

<Content>good hotel but nothing unique A nice hotel in a great city. Nice location. I read a review from someone else here describing the lobby as a lot of dusty, fake greenery. I do agree, the lobby is big, but not bright and cheery. It's you typical large city convention hotel, not too much character. I have come to the conclusion that longtime business travelers have know for a long time: it doesn鈥檛 matter what the brand of hotel is, they are all the same in a city. Please please please don't pay more just because this is a Hyatt because it could easily be any other hotel. The name means nothing in a city. When visiting San Francisco, don鈥檛 have a car unless you need it. This hotel is located with public transit right outside your door. The California line for trolley cars is just feet from the door, BART and the MUNI metro are across the street. The F-Line streetcars run right by the hotel and go to Fisherman鈥檚 Warf and Union Square. The ferry building is located in the back of the hotel and will take you to Sausalito. We even got to Muir Woods without a car by using the very comfortable and efficient Golden Gate Transit Buses. The embarcadero and ferry building is fun to hang out at on an afternoon for a long lunch and lazy day of shopping. There was an art festival with vendors and such on the weekend when we were there. The hotel rooms are about the normal size for a city hotel. The bathroom is quite small and not all that luxiourus. The Mini-bar is computerized so don鈥檛 think your storing anything of yours in there. It's overpriced as usual ($3.50 for a can of soda) but once in a while its fun to empty it out when your business is paying. Otherwise, there is a Walgreen鈥檚, 7-11 and Starbucks located across the street for more reasonable snacking. The fitness center is small and there is no pool. We did not see the revolving restaurant. I will warn you that we ate at the breakfast buffet in the morning for free but if your paying it's an outrageous $20 per person! Its good food but not worth that much!If you have ever been to NYC you will appreciate this comparison. If you love time square and all of its tackiness, stay at Fisherman鈥檚 Warf. If you enjoy the more laid back areas that are not as touristy then stay out of the Warf area. If you have any questions about the transit in the area of the hotel don鈥檛 hesitate to email me.

<Content>Okay, but not 4 star standard I stayed at this hotel on June 19, 2005. I was excited to stay at 4 star hotel but it didn't live up to expectations. The atrium was nice, but not grand. It looks a bit outdated. Service was adequate, but our room could use improvement. The room seemed a bit tired. The faucet handle was difficult to turn, toilet flush was weak, and there was dent on the side of the tub. They had a minibar, but no fridge. If you have a car, don't park at the hotel. There's only valet parking which costs $47 per day...ouch! On a positive note, the location was great, with shopping and restaurants nearby.

<Content>it was ok...but.. stayed there for a conference. it was ok, nothing really impressive. the location is good, very convenient to BART and cable car, as well as the big shopping center. it is closed to the ferry building, where a very good market located. i got a room that the bay could be seen, the view was great. however, i do not like the room very much. the carpet was dirty and stained. they told me it's an non-smoking room; however, i could smell the smoke and some ash trays were provided!? the bathroom has bad lightening so that it looks not very bright. maybe that's why the bath tub did not look very clean. Worst of all, the water pressure was very low. it took me forever to wash my hair. Complained about it but nothing was done. if it's not for the conference (which i don't have to pay) i would have not stayed there.

<Content>Nice hotel and location Stayed here for one night in July. Got the Hyatt Regency for $70 through Priceline. Had a bit of difficulty in finding the hotel (our fault because we didn't print out directions). Called ahead to request two beds since we are a party of four and non smoking. No problems with receiving our requests. There were tons of people checking in but the line moved very quickly. Beautiful atrium with glass elevators. I read this was the largest hotel atrium in the world. We were very surprised to get to our room and discover we were put in one that was handicapped accessible and only had a shower. I like tubs. We tried later to switch but were unable to because they were completely sold out and also had run out of rollaways. It was just weird that this was our second night in a row in a handicapped accessible room for accommodations that had been purchased through Priceline. We slept well however. Cannot put anything in the refrigerator as it is one of those electronically controlled models. If you wanted an empty one, the cost was $20. Staff was very nice especially the bellhops. Parking was very expensive - $48 a night with in and out privileges. Great location. Right across the street from a Walgreens, Starbucks and 7 Eleven. Would stay here again.

<Content>Great Place For a reasonable Priceline bid, I imagine most any traveler will be happy here. The hotel is sort of a large cement behemoth, with a lobby and atrium that feels very Disneyworld-like. Not a terribly personal hotel or quirky hotel, rather it's very corporate and efficient. My 12th floor room was clean, with a great view of the Bay Bridge. The bathroom wasn't terribly exciting and the water pressure's a little lax. I arrived around noon, after a cross-country trip. The hotel staff promptly checked me in. I loved being able to open my windows. The street below is loud, but you're in the middle of the Embarcadero.If paying full price, there are infinitely more classy, San Francisco-authentic hotels. Still, this was a terrific bargain in a city that's very pricey.

<Content>I love this hotel My brother and I had a great stay at this hotel. The location is perfect: across from the Ferry Building with little shops and restaurants, literally 10 steps away from the trolley stop to Union Square, 2-minute walk to BART/ Muni station, only 15 minute walk to Chinatown or Union Square, safe location, and the list goes on and on. My flight arrived early in the morning, so I took a 20-minute BART ride from SFO and registered at the front desk. Kathleen checked me in and told me the room would be ready in a couple of hours. No problem, I had to pick up my brother at OAK anyway. I asked the bellstaff to keep my bag until I returned. Don't forget to ask for vouchers that offer 50% off your bill at the hotel restaurants; they won't give them to you if you don't ask. Check-in experience was flawless.We didn't want to pay additional $30/day for a partial-bay view room so we settled for a city view. Our room was on the 7th floor. The room is spacious with the usual accompaniments: 25 TV, workdesk, coffeemaker, minibar. The minibar has a sensor that charges you automatically when you remove an item from it. If you move one item out to put in your own food, you'll be charged for that item. We asked housekeeping for extra pillows and hangers, they delivered them right away. The room has sliding doors that open up fully to give you fresh air and a view of the street down below. The traffic can be noisy but if the doors are closed you can sleep like a baby at night. About the pillows, yes, they are squishy. You can either bring your own pillow or just ask if housekeeping has extra pillows. Water pressure in the shower was a bit weak, but that didn't ruin our vacation.We didn't go to any of the restaurants in the hotel because we wanted to experience the city. The hotel's reception is on the third floor, which is a good idea because you don't have conference people on the street level going through your lobby. The fitness room on the second floor has 1 eliptical trainer, 2 stairmasters, 1 pull-up/dip station, 2 bikes, 2 treadmills, a dumbell station in the corner, some rolled yoga mats, a couple of bosu balls, a table with drinking water, and fresh towels. These machines face two TV's mounted on the wall. Very clean room and well-lit room but no view. You need your room key to enter and (the cool thing is) the door automatically unlocks itself as you leave the room. The room can be busy in the morning, as it was at 6:30am when I was there, but then at 7:15am the crowd was thinning.Concierge has all the info you need. You don't need to rent a car because of the hotel's proximity to all transportation transfer points, but if you do there is Budget Rental Car desk in the lobby. I think valet parking charges $10 the first hour, maximum of $26 per day. The atrium lobby is stunning, and the elevators provide a great view. You may ask for a room near the elevator, which what we got. Otherwise, the walk can be unbearable, even with the view of the lobby.There is Starbucks and Walgreens (who can develop 1-hour photos) across the street. There are cafes and bagel shops within 2-3 minutes walk. On Saturdays and Tuesdays from 11am to 2pm there is Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building, selling produce and lunches. Night Farmer's Market is on Thursdays.One thing to remember: to save water and energy, the hotel changes linens on your bed everytime they have new guests in the room, and every three days, unless you ask. So I asked housekeeping to change my bed sheets every day. To help them clean my room easier and faster, I put all dirty/used towels on the floor on one corner to be replaced. In return, I graciously left the housekeeper some tips for her hardwork.All of the staff, from housekeeping to bellstaff was very helpful and kind. All wake-up calls were done with a real person, and I appreciate their effort to pronounce my difficult last name. I got my rate from Priceline, which I thought I overpaid, but I will definitely recommend this hotel to everybody for this price. All five stars for location, staff, service, building design, and room.

<Content>Just Okay We just returned from San Francisco and stayed for 3 nights at the Hyatt. We were surprised that this hotel has a 4-star rating from AAA. It doesn't deserve it! The Hyatt rooms are old and just average. The bathroom only had a toilet and shower in it--with the sink located outside of the bathroom--something you would definitely find in a cheaper hotel chain. If you can tolerate the hotel room, there are some good things about the location. The cable car, BART, Muni and F-line trolley car are right outside your door. If you are lucky, you may get a room with an outside view. Also, the breakfast buffet was quite good and included in our AAA room rate.

Staff was friendly and helpful and my room with a view of the Bay was nice and spacious. Valet parking at $50 a day was pretty stiff but you can park next door for $27 a day (without in-and-out provleges.)

<Content>Nice view, but fair overall I stayed at the Hyatt for a conference for 4 days and was not at all impressed for the pretty high group rate we were paying. Minuses: rooms are pretty small, bed was extremely uncomfortable, tiny bathrooms(showers don't even compare to Holiday Inn Express for instance), rooms and overall hotel were not very clean, decor is outdated and the fare was just that, fair. Not all what you would expect from a Hyatt or comparable chain. Pluses: Helpful concierge and valet attendants, having a club level room that was on a higher floor, a small but nice balcony, and the view of the bay. From other attendees at my conference I was extremely lucky to garner a room with a nice view, even on the club level, as most were said to be very limited. I would not come back to this hotel for pleasure.

<Content>Great Hotel Purchased room through priceline. Found hotel to be nice, comfortable, and above average. Check-in was a breeze and front desk employees were very helpful. I wouldn't really consider this the Union Square area...a nice 20 minute walk, but it is a great location for picking up a trolley, bus, etc. from right in front of hotel. Embacadero Center has shops and restuarants for those who do not want to venture far from hotel.

<Content>Disappointed in the Hyatt... My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency. He wanted to stay at the Hyatt because of the revolving restaurant, Equinox. I wanted to stay in a suite at one of the more smaller hotels (boutique) or even the Omni. The room was small and the bay view was very limited. Also, although we had reservations, when we arrived we only had a choice of the second floor or the 8th floor, which was the smoking floor. The hotel's lobby is huge and beautiful, but they truly did not splurge on the rooms. The reception stated that the hotel caters to conventions and that is exactly what it felt like. The BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT, however was the hefty valet parking (there is no self parking). Parking per night was $41.00 plus a tax, which ended up being almost $50.00. For a three night stay it cost us $147.00 total for parking alone. My next stay will NOT be at the Hyatt Regency with all of the other hotels available.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location The Hyatt Regency San Francisco is a nice hotel. It's very pricey-- not as much for the quality of the room, but for the location. It is right at the beginning of one of the cable car lines, has a stop for the buses that take you to Fisherman's Wharf right outside, and has stunning bay views. There is a Starbucks and a Walgreen's, right across the street as well as an infinate number of restaurants within walking distance. It is right next door to Embarcadero Center... a retail shopping mall that spans 4 blocks. We stayed here because my husband was attending a conference at the Hyatt. The room was nice. They offered ammenities like shampoo, soap, and conditioner, but no lotion or other extras. I have yet to stay at a hotel that had a clean shower/tub. This was no different. There was hair in the tub when we got there. We liked the daily newspaper and the concierge was helpful with public transportation and restaurant suggestions. If you're visiting soon, go see Les Miserables. It is a phenomenal show playing at the Curran Theatre. We paid $210/night.... I never would've paid that much for the Hyatt myself, but we were reimbursed by my husband's company.

<Content>Marginal at Best We just returned from 3 nights at the Hyatt Regency at Embarcadero and we feel that the property is in dire need of a facelift. The room was warm and comfortable, however, the lobby and the atrium were extremely drab and dreary. The location is central to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and Union Square, easily within walking distance or if you prefer, public transportation was easily accessible. We have stayed in upscale hotels in the past and this fell well below the bar.

<Content>Better than we thought This hotel had a great location for being able to walk around the Embarcadero and on down to Fisherman's Wharf. We walked from the hotel to and from the SF Giants game down at SBC Park. Hotel itself was roomy although had a rather small toilet/shower area. We could open our window to get a fresh breeze from the bay but streets below were very loud. With the windows closed, the room was very quiet. Front desk personnel couldn't have been more efficient. We found none of the problems that previous reviewers had written about the hotel. We were quite pleased for the $75 we spent on PriceLine.

<Content>Big problem with Hyatt I recently stayed at the Hyatt in SF in may for 1 night, the Hotel was quite nice and the room was nice with a great view of SF bay, but I just found out today that I got double booked. I reserved my room on priceline for a great price, 85$ tax included, but I ust noticed on my bank statement that the Hyatt charged my credit card for 108$, which includes parking, this is absolutely outrageous, and I'm in the process of getting this charge removed, I liked the hotel itself but I'm just giving everone a warning about the practices of the Hyatt chain, as they seem to be crooks just out to get your money.

<Content>Great value My family of four just returned from a trip to SF. The Hyatt Regency was at a terrific location (across from the Ferry building) and adjacent to any kind of transportation you could imagine! We were in Chinatown in minutes via the cable car (which was never crowded at our location!). Other tourists waited a couple of hours to ride at other locations, and we got on and off in minutes on our line. After hoofing around the city for a week with two little ones, I can tell you that location is a priority in the city. We even took BART straight to our hotel from the airport. The ride is less than $5 per person and was safe and fast. The hotel itself is huge, and the staff was attentive and hard-working. The lobby is cavernous and the style reminds me a bit of Disney's Contemporary in Orlando. The bar has a super view of the harbor and is quiet and relaxing. We didn't dine at Equinox because our children were so young, but we went upstairs and admired the view from the revolving restaurant. The menu looked delicious! The room was standard and quiet. Staying near Fisherman's wharf would have been much noisier. We got the room at $90 a night through Priceline, and I heard from other travelers that our price was steal for a room in SF in the summer. We'd recommend the Hyatt again.

<Content>Needs a little work We got this hotel through Priceline. The rooms were comfortable and the location was adequate but there were definitely some (minor) issues with our stay.First, the good. The hotel is very striking when you first arrive. The decor of the rooms is good. We really liked our beds. We ate at the bar the first night we arrived and although we thought it was a bit pricey at first we were pleased with the portions provided.The bad. The hyatt tries to come off as this upscale hotel, but really they are trying to pinch every penny they can out of you. The mini bar is computerized, so if you try to move things around (i.e. put something of your own in there) you will automatically be charged. We didn't know this and had been moving things around all night. The next morning we saw the tiny notice on the mini fridge and called the front desk. Thankfully, they removed the charges. If you want to use the fridge for yourself it is a $10 charge. Also there are no vending machines because they want you to take the overpriced products in the minifridge. This was a bit annoying.Next issue was that our coffee maker was broken. It took over an hour for someone to come and replace it. The hotel is located on the edge of the embarcadero right across from the Ferry Building. It is a bit of a walk to most sights, but if you don't mind a walk it is not too big of a deal. There are bus stops right at the corner. If I were to go back to SF I would probably look for a different part of town to stay in as this is the Financial District and dead after dark. Still, a good deal for Priceline.

<Content>Great location, everything else was so-so We stayed at the Hyatt Regency SF on the Embarcadero from 5/27 to 5/31. We were not too impressed for the price we paid. We had 3 rooms as there were 7 in our party; however one had to sleep on a chair and lounge as they didn't have any queen rooms. I had called a month ago to request 2 beds in at least 1 room, so that was a little disappointing. The location of the hotel could not be any better. You walk out the door and there is the F line, Cable Car and Bart/Muni station. Our complaints鈥?internet access is $9.95 per day. But my problem is this. My laptop has a satellite internet connection so where ever I am I can connect. Well, at this hotel they block all other internet connections. So although I pay to be able to have a connection available to me anywhere, they feel the privilege to block my service provider to me. Do they block cell phone connections so you have to use their telephones? No. So why internet? Also, they attempted to charge us $80 for the Continental Breakfast that came with our room package and it was like pulling teeth for them to cancel the charges. The bar is well understaffed as not one group of guests that would sit down for a drink would be served within 15 minutes of arriving. Finally, we just went down the street. Also, they need to make an effort to not let the homeless pester their guests. I understand once you hit the sidewalk it is their right, but each time we鈥檇 walk out the door, under the covered valet driveway, we were hit up for money, and once yelled at in profanities. The hotel does seem a little older, I think because of all the concrete and the dusty fake greenery in the lobby and along the floors. As far as the rooms, the linens weren鈥檛 great. I鈥檝e had duvets at 3 star hotels, but not here. The thin scratchy comforter was awful. Concierge was extremely hard to get a hold of. Most the time we鈥檇 just visit them on the way out of the hotel as they never answered the phone.While I鈥檝e touched on all of the negative, the Hyatt was not THAT bad. It is just not what we had hoped for being a Hyatt. And for the price, we really shouldn鈥檛 have had any complaints.Best feature: LocationWorst feature: Attentiveness to service

<Content>Adequate Service Check in was as smooth as can be. Conference space was great. Concierge helped with booking Alacatraz. Trying to get a hold of the Equinox restaurant on Sunday evening for a reservation was difficult. No one answered the phone and it went to a recording. I called the Concierge and they did not answer after 6 rings. I called the front desk who did answer on the first ring and was glad to transfer to the Maitre'D who answered on the second ring and called me by name and room number. Very frustrating.The rooms seem to be old and need to be updated.

<Content>Very Nice Experience The Hyatt Regency is located on a great spot right across from the San Francisco Ferry Terminal. We came in to town for the infamous Bay to Breakers event, we chose to stay at the Hyatt as it was literally steps away from the start line. We had a very spacious and well-appointed room with a balcony that looked out over the bay as well as some courtyards and modern art pieces. The hotel is also conveniently located right at a BART station (runs directly to SFO airport) and at a cable car station.We had never stayed on the Embarcadero before, but we found it to be quite pleasant. It's not as happening as North Beach or Union Street or some other parts of town, but there were several good restaurants in the area and it was easy and pleasant to walk around the Embarcadero area.We had a very reasonable corporate rate, otherwise this might have been a bit more than we were looking to spend for this trip. But the service, location and room quality definitely exceeded our expectations.

<Content>Not up to Hyatt standards We were greatly disappointed in the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero. The location was good, and the front desk staff was friendly, but the hotel facilities desperately need updating and cleaning! There was a ring of dust around the entire room perimeter. They had to send a special cleaner to vacuum for us as the regular housekeeping staff doesn't clean edges! The blanket binding was torn and the towels were old, stiff and worn out.

<Content>Worth the value! We had a wonderful stay! Stayed here for 4 nights with my husband last week from Apr 20 -Apr.24. Pretty good deal considering what we paid for! We bid from priceline, $75 per night plus tax and fees. The front desk people are really nice. Got 4 50% off coupon for any Hyatt restaurant in San Francisco when we checked in. Got a partial Bay view room (we called them up after we bid for the hotel) without surcharge. The room is big and designed clever and very clean.Talk about the location, it's not as great as Union square hotels, but it's really convenient to take any public transportation to anywhere you want. We took BART from airport to the hotel, it took us 40 minutes and we got there around 8:20pm local time ($4.95 per person). We had one big luggage and 2 small carry on's. The hotel is right at exit of Bart. We did have problem with the public transportation on weekend though. Some MUNI won't stop in front of the hotel on weekends. We ended up to take street car (F line) to union square then catch bus there to go to Japan Town for the cherry blossom festival. You can take F street car directly go to Fishermen Whart!The ferry building is the best. I had the freshest oyster there and other delicious home made food. The price of the goods was kind of high although we didn't plan to ship farm goods home.We loved Alcatraz island trip and beach blanket babylon's show! 3 days kind of short for me but it's enough for my husband since he hates seafood and the sour flour bread is kind of hard to chew for him.:)) They do have good Italian food, Chinese food. But we only went to those famous seafood place 'cause back home you will never find anything like those. Hope next time still stay here if we can get a deal like this on priceline again! :))

<Content>Not in the centre of the action I stayed here for one Saturday night. Shuttle van from the airport stopped here first, took about 30 minutes from the airport. Location isn't ideal, to get to Union square/Chinatown its quite a walk (15 mins) or two stops on the Bart/Muni. Starbucks across the road and a Croissant shop for breakfast. Hotel has wireless lan (chargeable) but my PC found a network that was free (although I had to hold laptop near the window). Would stay nearer Union Sq/Fishermans Wharf next time.

<Content>Great Stay - Perfect Location My fiance and I stayed at the Hyatt April 7th-11th. We went to San Francisco to see the sights and were not in our room except to sleep. For that purpose the Hyatt was wonderful. The location could not have been better, the BART, cable car, and the Street Cars are literally right outside the front door. The Ferry Building on the Embarcadaro was right across the street. You had transportation to where ever you wanted to go. We got our room from Priceline for $90/night and was well worth it. We did not eat or drink at any of the restaurants because we wanted to experience San Francisco and that was easy to do because of the location.

<Content>No Complaints Nice, if somewhat dated hotel. It was sold to me as a 4-star hotel, but it is kind of a 4-star minus (or a 3-star double-plus). Whether you are traveling on business or pleasure, though, the location is terrific. Cable cars and BART are both outside the door. Rooms are not cramped and certainly adequate, but nothing beyond above average. Staff was fine. Nice, if simple, exercise room with newer CV equipment and ample dumbells. If you are paying $200, you may be disappointed. If you get a deal through Priceline or Hotwire, you likely will be pleased.

<Content>Great Stay! My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights this month (March, 2005). The king/non-smoking room on the 17th floor was large, clean, and comfortable. We used priceline to get the room and were very happy with the price we paid. We liked the room and the hotel and would happily stay there again. There were Muni stops in several areas, right around the hotel, so it was easy to catch the street cars, buses, etc. The hotel is in the financial center, which means it's not in the heart of the tourist district. We did do a lot of walking, but that was our choice. Because of the hotel's location, there were many choices for breakfasts and lunches, but dinner options were harder to be found. This wasn't a big problem since we were usually out sight-seeing anyway and not near the hotel at that time. We also found some pizza places that delivered right to the room when we wanted to stay in for the evening.The room itself had a king bed, desk/table with 2 chairs, another chair with ottoman, and the TV armoire. The bathroom had the shower/tub/toilet in one room with the sink/vanity area outside of this. It was easy for two people to use both spaces at the same time, although it was a little tight when we were both in front of the mirror at the same time. There was a mini-bar in the room, which we did not use. The hotel offers the option of cleaning out the mini-bar and allowing guests to use it as their refrigerator for a $10.00 fee. When we called down from the room to request this option, they brought up another refrigerator instead and never charged us the fee!Our room was along an inside hallway, with a city view. The view wasn't so hot--it just looked out at another skyscraper. The room was quiet, however, because it did not overlook the atrium area of the hotel. We did hear the bells from the street cars, but this did not last very late into the night so sleeping wasn't a problem. Housekeeping did a nice job with cleaning the room each day, and overall, we had no complaints. We also found the staff to be friendly and helpful and enjoyed our stay!

<Content>Great location and great hotel I just returned from a 3 nights stay at the Hyatt Regency and I have no idea why this place is getting bad reviews! I do a ton of leisure traveling and I loved this place. The hotel itself is beautiful with an amazing lobby and a GREAT lobby bar (13 views) wut an equally great happy hour! We stayed on water side and had a OK view but the room was terrific. Two comfortable double beds, LOTS of room, and a nice bathroom with a seperate area to get ready in. Nice layout. The best part had to be the location. You are right next to the Embarcadero Ferry Station that has lots of cute shops. Also right on the F-line to Fisherman's wharf, easy ride for $1.25 and right on the California Cable Car line $3, as well as right by the BART system. There are breakfast places right outside of the hotel to grab a quick bite before your meeting or site seeing. I would stay at the Hyatt again in a minute.

<Content>Fantastic Lobby I love this hotel. It is a fantastic design, in a sort of ugly 70s way. Anyone who has not been in it before will have trouble visualizing the lobby; but it is a wonderful treat just to walk in. The entire floor is open, and goes up all 17 floors in a pyramid shape. Every floor is a ring around the lobby, and has a balcony ourside the room looking down on it. Every room also has a window on the outside, and there are no inside rooms, so there are no rooms without views.The staff is friendly but not overly attentive, and you get the feeling that anything you need can be taken care of (this is helped by the prominant concierge desk).There is a resturant and a bar in the lobby, and both serve the same food (as does room service). The bar, The 13 Views is a lovely place for a quiet drink, and features a good beer selection as well as some exotic mixed drinks. The prices are not outragous for a hotel bar, and the enviroment is very nice, with comfortable chairs and couches. About half of the bar is in the open lobby, and half under an overhang looking out on the Justin Herman plaza.There is another resturant, the Equinox, which is a rotating fine dining restaurant at the very top of the hotel. I did not go in during my stay because it got some pretty poor reviews on the internet.Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay. This hotel while perhaps a little bit further from Union Square than some might like, offers a relaxing retreat, and is a sight to be seen unto itself. I hightly recommend staying here.

<Content>Overpriced and overrated I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero for five nights while I attended a conference. The location and surrounding area is great - very scenic, safe and transportation very accessible.I found the Hotel to be of poor quality including atmosphere, linens, and bedding. The room was very noisy with street noise - the sliding glass door seemed poorly sealed. While the staff was helpful, the quality of the facility was hardly worth the price. There is absolutely nothing at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero that provides any chance for relaxation or enjoyment. While the food was adequate it was completely overpriced.I've stayed at other Hyatt facilities and always found them to be very nice and well worth the price, so $200/night was an astronomical amount for a less than average facility

<Content>Not worth the price.. Stayed there for 3 nights with my wife. Nothing special or impressive. Very expensive compared to general quality. The main problem is; the hotel is too noisy. Noises come from; the atrium, the street, the heater, adjacent rooms, corridor, everywhere !!.. The rooms are quite cold in winter since the very wide glass windows (I should say glass wall). You can turn on the air conditioner to heat the room, but this time you get all the noises of hissing and squeaking. In summary; not worth the price, not worth the Hyatt title..

<Content>I love the SF Hyatt Regency I stay in hotels in San Francisco often, and I enjoy the SF Hyatt Regency the most. I want to say right off the bat that this assumes I have a king room, bay view with balcony -- which IMHO is absolutely worth the price to upgrade. (I'm a Hyatt Gold Passport member, and I have had very good luck getting upgraded.)I find the architecture of the hotel fascinating and the somewhat Zen rooms extremely comfortable and efficient. I love hanging out on my balcony in the evening, or watching the boats and world go by in the daytime. Any service or store you could ever want is in either the Embarcadero shops or the Ferry Building marketplace....and all these places are used by locals so you are plunked down in the middle of a part of real San Francisco...not a tourist area per se.BART, the Cable Car, and a host of other public transportation options are right at your doorstep.I also like the level of service I have received here. It's not overly intimate and personal, but that's fine with me.Big Exception: I hate paying $38 for Valet parking. It seems like a crime.

<Content>Great Location! Definitely not as bad as some of the reviews said. Location was fantastic, although the music from the ice rink was annoying at times. Lucky to have had a 2nd floor room overlooking the embarcadero, Oakland Bay Bridge, Ferry Bldg and the Bay. Great rate through Priceline, otherwise this is just a large convention hotel. Yep, the room and bathroom was somewhat small but you couldn't beat the view. I don't think I would have liked the hotel though, if we had another room. There wasn't much character to it. The revolving restaurant upstairs was cozy and perfect for evening cocktails. The hotel gives you soap, shampoo and conditioner...that's it. You need to request a refrigerator for personal use. The mini bar clearly states it is not for personal use and you will be charged. The Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building was out of this world. The Bart and cable cars are all within one block. Walgreen's and deli's are all over the place if you need stuff.

<Content>There are plenty of other hotels in San Francisco This hotel is in a good location: next to the outdoor ice skating rink, the cable car picks up right there to go to Union Square, and the street car can take you to the Embarcadero. That's where my favorable review ends. The room we had was dark and cave-like, with a partial view of the ice skating rink, which plays loud music until 10:30 p.m. When we ordered dessert from room service we were told the delicious photos we were looking at and ordering from were no longer available. We settled on chocolate ice cream and 20 minutes later vanilla showed up. The room service staff went to fetch chocolate and called us to inform us that chocolate was all sold out. Not a big deal, I know...but how can you sell out of chocolate ice cream?? My husband and I decided to slip down to the bar (great views if you can snag a sofa by the windows) and 30 minutes went by before anyone came to take our drink order. The place was half full. I wouldn't return to this hotel, even considering the good deal we got.

<Content>Great Location/Rate Stayed here at the end of September. Got a $105 rate from Hotwire, a real bargain for SF. Great location by BART and MUNI, Ferry Bldg. The room was clean and comfortable - what one would expect from Hyatt. I did not use any of the facilities or eat any meals in the hotel. Lots of dining options in Ferry Bldg., and Harbor Village (Chinese dim sum restaurant) is next door in the Embarcadero Center.

<Content>So, So Stayed there for four nights in early November during the Hotel workers strike. Was woken up at 6 AM every day (even though we were on the 15th floor!) by striking (or locked out) workers with drums and airhorns. Luckily I am from the East Coast so was used to getting up early. Even with the strike and reduced workforce the service at the hotel was very good and did not notice a drop off which is a credit to those that were working the double shifts. THe hotel itself is a very nice hotel with a beautiful and very, very large atrium with numerous places to sit and relax, have a drink or do some work. The location is right along the Embarcadero waterfront by the Farmer's Market/Ferry Building with views of the Bay Bridge. Pier 39 and Fisherman's wharf are a nice walk/street car ride to the north while the Union Square shopping district is just a mile or less up market street (again can be walked in 20 minutes or you can take the subway, bus or trolley car). China Town is close too. We did not have a car (parking is $45 per day) and never needed one with plentiful modes of transportation. The rooms are very nice and large for hotel rooms with a unique angle to them. Food choices are plentiful for all meals and there is a Walgreens right across the street for those items you might have left at home. The big drawbacks are noise from the city is heard throughout the night even with ear plugs and the fan on. The walls are pretty thin as we could always hear the neighbors TV until late at night. Finally, be careful with the wet bars. Everytime you open it even to look in it you get charged. I kept my own water and milk in there and had $80 worth of refreshment charges on my bill that I had to fight to get taken off.

<Content>Cavernous and lacks character If all you want is a bed for the night, and you get a good deal from Priceline, and you don't mind staying in a cavernous, characterless place that specializes in mega-conventions, and for some reason you're wowed by a pointlessly large atrium -- then by all means, go for it!I think with a bit of effort, there are probably better, more memorable places to stay in SF.

<Content>horrible experience We stayed there from sept 27 to oct 3. The hotel staff started striking about middle of our stay which we understand not much can be done by the hotel staff. However, the 2nd day after strike began, we found our room door opened/unlocked when we got back in the evening, after being gone from 8 am!! We called front desk right away and the guy did not even apologize!! Just said room service had a rough day, as you know, because of the strike!! They did call security and they apologized but they said there's nothing they can do?! Luckily my luggages were still in the room. You would think that security is basic at all hotels and we are talking about Hyatt....will NOT recommend at all!

<Content>Cool Atrium Wouldn't stay here on my own dime. The atrium/lobby is a remrkable feature but nothing else worth the price, unless you get a good view. My eighth floor view to the south wasn't much. Some wrote $42/day to park. I paid $28 in June. Couldn't get the local sports station in my room to watch an A's game so I went to the bar and they didn't get it there either. The bartender could hardly understand what I wanted and had to surf the channels to see if he got it. Pretty lame for a high priced joint.

<Content>Labor Day Weekend Retreat Spent the night before Labor Day at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco in the Embarcadero Center. Got a good rate of $82 plus hotel taxes,etc. We stayed in a tenth floor room facing the Ferry Building and with a nice view of the bay. The room had a king size bed, desk, overstuffed chair with an ottoman and still lots of room. Used Trip Advisor to find an excellent restaurant (Pacific Catch on Chestnut  Fillmore). If you stay on Sundays or Holidays the street parking is free which saves you a good piece of change. The Ferry Building had several restaurants which seemed to be bustling with activity. You can use the Muni bus lines to get to most places. Just call them and tell them where you are and where you're going.

<Content>A Good Value We stayed at the Hyatt Regency - San Francisco (at Embarcadero Center) two nights in mid-May. We got an excellent senior citizen rate. The room was comfortable with an outstanding view of the Bay Bridge and the newly redone Ferry Building.As others have noted the bathroom area was a bit small compared to most Hyatts.Note that this is a convention hotel, so you may have to contend with large groups. As with many San Francisco hotels, parking is very expensive.The food in the main hotel restaurant was very good, but prices were high. Fortunately, with the revitalization of the Ferry Building and the surrounding Embarcadero area there are a number of dining opportunities nearby.

<Content>Skip this Hyatt in San Fran We were forewarned about the expensive valet parking at the Hyatt (approx $42 with tax per day), so that was a known negative. But the room was dated, the hallways lining the atrium included dusty, disheveled fake greenery, and the service was lousy. No friendly faces. Personnel seemed to have the This IS the Hyatt mentality, which was very unwelcoming. We were charged mini-bar charges electronically because we added something to the fridge (charges were dropped when we complained). Had to request additional towels and coffee. WAY overrated and overpriced. Will never stay at a Hyatt again. The ony positive thing was the cable car stopped right in front of the hotel, which was convenient for touring.

<Content>Just okay... We stayed at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco from February 29 March 3. The room was very spacious with a great bay view. Even though we were on the fourth floor, the noise from the street was not disturbing. Front desk and concierge staff were both very helpful. The hotel is great for meetings and conventions (our reason for staying) but a little far from the Union Square area (still in walking distance though). Shops and restaurants within the Embarcadero Center close early enough for it to be inconvenient. There are few places to grab a dinner after 6 pm other than the hotel restaurant which charges exorbitant prices for room service (i.e. $4 for a glass of milk). The open concept lobby is impressive with the numerous glass elevators. The bed and pillows were not overly comfortable but the room was extremely functional. I especially appreciated the armchair and automan in the room. The sliding door is a nice touch but there were pigeons on our balcony so we never kept it open. The bathroom was clean but a little run-down definitely not what I was expecting from a Hyatt. One small complaint they showed the Oscars on a big screen in the lobby. Because it is open concept, we could hear the telecast in our rooms! If I were returning to San Francisco as a tourist, I wouldn't stay at this hotel there are much better deals closer to Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf. However, for a conference/meeting or business within the Financial District, the hotel was very conveniently located.
