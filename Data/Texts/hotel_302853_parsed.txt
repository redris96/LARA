<Content>Very pleased with our choice! We were just delighted with the Bamboo Garden Hotel! The gardens are lovely and our room nicely decorated and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much. The food at the hotel restaurant was delicious. Be forewarned, the first time you walk down the alleyway to the hotel you might think you've made a big mistake. You haven't! You will be very pleasantly surprised as to what awaits you.The ladies at the front desk are helpful and efficient, but not exactly warm or charming. Perhaps just a cultural difference.It is close to the subway and just a little way to the south there is a terrific park with lakeside eating choices. Wishing you a great time in Beijing!

<Content>Memorable hotel We stayed in Bamboo Garden Hotel during the Beijing leg of our China Tour primarily because we don't want generic looking hotels so much and we were not disappointed. It is located in the Hotungs and not very famous with taxi drivers but they were always helpful and we were able to go back no problem with help of the hotel card. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Simple service that feels genuine and none of those super trained 5 star hotel types. We went together with our 11 month old and 3 yr old kids. The staff were very kind and entertained them while we are waiting for some reception confirmation, taxi etc. The rooms are ok, clean with huge firm beds. My baby didn't like the crib they provided though( too small) so she slept with us. The huge bed was great!My 3 year old son loved the hotel so much. It's look, it's garden , with the blue birds and especially the red lanterns at night. Until now he still talks about the Bamboo Hotel and asks us to go back :)For my husband the best part is the massage. Really relaxing after a day of touring. The in room computer is also great as we didn't have room to bring our laptop with all the kiddie gear we had. There are several small eateries around but we didn't get to try them. The drumtower is also nearby and from the drumtower other places of interest are a stroll away. Definitely a good location especially if you love walking or biking around. We did not walk so much though with 2 kids in tow. But taxi was not hard to come by :)

<Content>Nice hotel in a nice area Bamboo Garden hotel is located 5-7 minutes to Gulou subway station in a hutong. One can reach the bell and drum towers and the Houhai Lake in less than 10 minutes walking. Especially the lake is quiet nice with lots of shops, restaurants, public dancing and singing etc.The hotel is very quiet, there are some nice courtyards and lots of stuff to care about guests. Our standard suite for app. 800 RMB (close to the Olympics) was very nice, large and clean. It was equipped with a large flat screen TV with lots of foreign channels and a computer with broadband internet. Breakfast was very good but relatively pricey for 60 RMB. Small shops and a supermarket are around the corner.We especially enjoyed staying in a small hotel in a hutong area and not in a large chain-hotel, which seem to be located mostly at main roads with lots of traffic.

<Content>Hotel History I stayed at this Hotel a long time ago but would highly reccomend it. I chose this hotel because I had just read Claws of the Dragon by John Byron and John Pack., a biography of Kang Sheng, a high level Politburo member during the Cultural Revolution. If you are planing on staying here read this book for some facinating background

<Content>A Beijing Getaway The best part of this hotel is that it's not in the hotel district; it's located in a residential area in an old part of the city, a walled district known as a huotang. Also, most guests are independent travelers. We did not encounter any tour groups. The hotel restaurant is excellent and cheap. We had a semi-deluxe room, which was small but adequate. Bathroom was fine, lots of hot water. The air conditioner was loud and it took the staff a day or two to get the temperature right. Beds are hard as they are everywhere in China, but housekeeping put a quilt underneath the sheet for us. Service is great even when you can't find anyone who speaks English. We booked by sending Wendy an e-mail from the hotel website. She arranged our stay, and an excursion to the Jinshanling part of the Great Wall for 150 USD. Do arrange for an airport pick-up, about $25 to $30 USD. It's more expensive than a cab but you won't risk the driver not knowing where the place is. The hotel is close to a subway stop on a line that will take you to all the sites.

<Content>Peaceful Oasis I recently spent 3 nights at the Bamboo Garden Hotel with my husband and teenage son. The taxi driver struggled to find the hotel  had to stop to get directions. As we searched for the hotel I was concerned as the area was run down and known as the hutongs. However, as soon as we arrived we knew we had found a hidden gem.The room was filled with authentic furniture and yet it had modern features. The hotel  grounds were peaceful. We particularly enjoyed our visits to the Tea Room which had an underfloor fish pool. The staff were friendly and would not accept tips.We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A great small hotel I couldn't agree more with Greystones 23 who took the words right out of my mouth. My wife and I also stayed there in April and the only thing I would add to Greystones comments would be that the hotel courtyard was also beautiful with the cherry and apple blossom in full bloom. There are ponds and waterfalls with goldfish, however I must say I did feel a little sorry for the few goldfish in the  font . A Great little hotel and excellent value for money

<Content>A quiet oasis in a noisy city We stayed here for 3 nights in April 2008 and found it a little oasis in a melee of noise, smells and sounds. We would certainly recommend this hotel.The staff were friendly and laughed at our attempts to try to say hello and thank you in Chinese but did try to help with our pronunciations. The rooms were clean and decorated in traditional Chinese style. The duvets were silk and were warm and comfortable. A tea tray was provided and all bathroom extras were there. The food was excellent when we stayed for dinner as were the breakfasts each morning. We did have to teach the girl behind the bar how to make gin and tonics! We took tea on the tea terrace where we were served tea by the boy with the 'long spouted kettle'.Because it is in a hutong you have to pass the public toilet which can smell a bit but it all adds to the life of the city and one that might disappear quickly with the rate of new building in Beijing. The hotel is bordered by a block of flats that overlooks the garden.

<Content>Bamboo Garden - perfect! Family of four stayed at the Bamboo Garden Hotel. We booked two rooms and both were clean, modern, and lovely. My son spoke some Chinese and that was helpful with the hotel staff.We booked a driver through the hotel to pick us up at the airport - but he/she never arrived. Fortunately, our son met us at the airport and we took a taxi to the hotel - for a lot less than we were quoted by the hotel website staff.The grounds were magical - after sightseeing, it was wonderful to sit on the patio and drink a beer among the blossoms.Hotel staff was helpful, friendly and attentive. Rooms had flat screen TV's and computers with internet access. Each bathroom had soap, shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste among other things.The hotel was located down a hutong - with stores that sold food, beer, tea, etc. Each room had a fridge to eat left over goodies from dinners.Hotel was located near many places to eat - all of them wonderful - and most importantly - the hotel was only a few blocks from the subway - a great way to travel in Beijing.I fully recommend this hotel.

<Content>Bamboo Garden Beijing, a fantastic unconventional hotel Fantastic experience. I frequently travel for business, but this time it was an holiday I took with my wife in China. In Bamboo Garden Hotel we found nice and kind staff, English is spoken. Western breakfast is available andThe internal restaurant is also good. The hotel was an old noble house of a former imperial minister. Clean, quiet, nice with a wide garden and internal relaxing sight. The hotel is situated in the hutong area, and arriving by taxi, entering in the small street inside the Hutongs, you could have some doubts about your booking...Don't worry: the area is absolutely safe and secure, and entering in the hotel environment you think you are entering in a small paradise in a different time. There you can feel the real chinese life, living in a fantastic environment.This hotel is different than the usual buiness or travel hotels, and we spent our days in Beijing in a non conventional excellent hotel. I recommended it to friends and, for sure, for my next time in Beijing I will reserve again in Bamboo Garden.

<Content>Liked this hotel, but problems getting a taxi There was a lot to like about the Bamboo Garden. Lovely rooms, beautiful garden, great location in the hutongs with a lot of character. And free Internet!The biggest drawback seemed to be getting back at the end of the day. We didn't have a car and driver while in Beijing, so we had our guide write out the name of the hotel (with directions) in Mandarin to give to a taxi driver. However, taxis didn't seem to want to drive to the hutongs, or to be clear on how to get there. One night we had four taxis refuse to drive us before we finally found one who would. And they never drove us down our hutong -- which I understand, as it was quite narrow -- but they never even dropped us off at the right one. Fortunately, the first night we showed the directions to a local resident, who was able to point us in the right direction, and thereafter we memorized how to get there!The food at breakfast and the one dinner we ate there were average.Although we liked many things about the hotel, I wouldn't stay there again unless I had a driver that I knew would take me back at the end of each day.

<Content>Favorite hotel in China I just returned from a trip to China and have to say that my stay at the Bamboo Garden was my favorite. The neighborhood was safe and so interesting to wander around in. I t is just two blocks from the drum tower and a block from the subway station. The room was lovely and the gardens delightful. I enjoyed the restaurant very much. If you want a hotel with a true Chinese feeling to it, this is the place. I can't say enough about the staff who were so helpful and friendly. I was a single woman and felt very safe at the hotel and in the area. Communications with the hotel were promptly responded to and my request for a non smoking room was honored.

<Content>The perfect getaway in Beijing What a pleasure to spend the last evening of a two-week whirlwind trip around China on the grounds of this lovely, peaceful hutong hotel.Our flight back into Beijing arrived late at night, but hotel staff was there at the airport ready to receive us and whisk us away to the hotel. Check-in was efficient, and bellhops were courteous and quiet. We were taken aback by the beauty of our room. We had asked for a room with a garden view. Before our eyes were beds covered in lovely Chinese-red comforters, beautiful traditional Chinese furniture, our own computer with internet access, an immaculate bathroom, and windows opening to the garden. We spent a peaceful night and morning in the room and then enjoyed a short stroll across the grounds. Far away is the chaos of Beijing. You're in another world at this hotel. We enjoyed lunch at the hotel restaurant. Tea served from a long-spouted pot, table positioned on top of the transparent floor through which we could see the green pond, courteous service, and delicious food: Eight Treasure Tofu Pot, Bamboo shoots with mushrooms, Sweet and sour pork, and Beijing-style noodles. We loved this meal.We would go back again and again to stay at this hotel. In fact, it is on our list of places to revisit in China.

<Content>Nice origional hotel Very good hotel for its three star rating. The staff is very friendly. The neighbourhood is not so exciting, but it's near the Beihaipark, so you can walk to that. The room is beautifull and the garden even so. A pity is it, when it is raining you can not sit in the garden.You have free internet, but when your computer has a hardware error you can not use it. The have to repair it, but they didnot came.

<Content>Oasis of peace and gardens, good location, nice rooms Bamboo Garden has an authentic feel to it as soon as you step in, so we were surprised to find the flat screen TVs and in-room PC with fast Internet access (which I'm now using to write this review).Cons: room could be a bit cleaner (quite a lot of dust in ours), and the aircon doesn't really work that well. Breakfast isn't a highlight and not really recommended.Pros: rooms are full of character and comfortable, and it feels like you're staying in the real China (my perceived one, anyway). Location is close to old Beijing quarters and I'm pleased we didn't book one of the characterless tourist traps.The grounds and gardens are beautiful and peaceful. Overall we felt it was good value, a good location and a nice environment.

<Content>Shaky start, great hotel My first impressions of the hotel were not good - I'd booked the hotel's driver to collect me from the airport but was surprised to be asked at the hotel to pay the driver directly in cash rather than the cost being added to my hotel bill. I just had enough Chinese money with me to pay the driver. The hotel website said they offered currency exchange services so I tried to change $NZ but they wouldn't accept it, so limited currency exchange would have been more accurate - unless you have something like $US you're out of luck. The staff member I dealt with through this was not overly friendly or helpful.I had no problems from then on. The setting is great, very peaceful. I was shown to a lovely single room (411) full of character, with a fabulous bathroom and free internet access; later I booked an additional night and got a double room (416) which was just as good - no internet - but had a bit of drain smell in the bathroom - which as I later discovered you get in character hotels here as part of the package and is no problem if you close the bathroom door. The beds were the most comfortable of any I slept on during my trip.I ate a few dinners in the hotel restaurant and the food was OK - breakfast buffet just adequate - but also try the local street vendors and dumpling shops. Restaurant staff spoke very little English. I didn't try their spa; if you go left out the main gate and explore the hutongs you'll find the blind massage place - awesome - 2 mins walk. Make the most of the fabulous location.Most staff here speak limited English but are helpful. Ask them to write down your destination in characters to show taxi drivers, and also ask them to write in characters the hotel name and driving directions to it, as taxi drivers can never find it.This hotel was excellent value for money and offered a good balance between character and comfort.

<Content>Great hidden gem We arrived in the evening and the street you drive down is a little ominous in the dark! We asked to see the room before signing in and had a pleasant suprise. The clerk had said the room was chinese style which put us on our guard. The rooms appear to be recently remodeled. It may be Chinese style but has the western touch's of home. Flat screen TV with some english speaking stations. A nice sitting area for tea on your own private veranda overlooking the courtyard. The view to the courtyard is reminisant of a mountain scene. The staff is very friendly and wants to please. The food is good and the breakfast is western style, while lunch and dinner has the Chinese menu. This was a nice place to finish out our trip to China. AAA for the money!

<Content>A taste of old Beijing We stayed there for 4 nights for a vacation. The best part about this hotel is its classic lush Chinese garden. Especially dining on the restaurant patio, which has a beautiful grapevine cover and a nice view of the garden. It's very relaxing to have a meal or a drink there. The hotel is not exactly comfortable, if you are used to the amenities and services of 5-star conference hotels. The bathroom is too small and they only provide couple very thin towels. The location is fairly good. It takes about 10-15 minutes to walk to the nearest subway station, which is absolutely faster and more efficient than taking a cab. Most guests are older tourists that travel in groups. Although the place is very much a novelty to foreign tourists that want a taste of old Beijing, I don't think I'll choose there again. There are plenty of old Beijing to see in the city while you are out during the day. I would rather come back to a hotel room that has comfortable bed, nice linen, and big marble bathrooms equipped with high quality shampoo and large, soft, fluffy towels....stuff Bamboo Garden does not provide. We booked a small suite with 2 twin beds for $680RMB/night, but they just increased their rate this spring. The same suite would be more than $1,000RMB.

<Content>Great place to stay Hotel was brilliant. Good location away from the real hussle and bussle of Beijing but still close enough to get to everywhere easy enough.Tube only a 5 min walk away and good links to everywhere you want to go and if not taxis were always easy to hail down.Room was nice and large and very comfortable with everything you could ask for and with a nice view over the garden. Staff were really helpfull too. If you're after a trip to the great wall we booked ours throught the Youth Hostal just round the corner and couldn't fault it.Make sure you have the hotel written in chinese symbols for when you first arrive as it is a little hard to find being in the middle of the Hutongs.Loved the hotel and love Beijing. Would stay again in an instant.

<Content>a Great escape! oh, the tea house! oh, the gardens! oh, the wild vines growing over the roof of the outdoor restaurant! we adored this place and will be staying there again when we return to china this august.we had been booked into the novotel peace hotel in beijing when we first arrived, because we were on an adoption trip and i was very paranoid about having a safe IN the room (for cash, important papers etc.). well, after two days in a hotel that was fine enough, but could have been anywhere, we switched over to the bamboo garden. just driving down that long alleyway, past hutong where people were actually still living and working as in old times (so many of these are being torn down in favor of gleaming skyscrapers as olympics 2008 approach), you just felt like you were getting a taste of the real beijing. we had hired a guide who kept us running around like crazy all day, and when we got back to the bamboo garden, it was like weight literally flew from our shoulders and we were light again. i was able to put all my important stuff in the hotel safe behind the front desk, and all was well.if you don't stay at this hotel, definitely stay at one of the other hutong hotels. they are simply beautiful and magnificient. (the beds were twin, though, a la lucy and ricky, so be prepared for that!)

<Content>Great place to stay! We loved staying here on our vacation in October 2006. Its much more of an experience than staying at the bland Western-style hotels in Beijing. The best things about the place are the big, peaceful courtyard in the middle... the reception staff speak good English, the bar is really nice with a little waterfall in it with fish swimming around, and the location is great, 5 mins walk from the subway station. I'd really recommend using the subway. Its much less stress than having to deal with Beijing's taxi drivers. On our vacation we had two bad experiences with taxi drivers who charged us 3 times the proper price for the journey. After that we stuck to public transport and found it really easy.A few people have mentioned that the Bamboo Garden has hard beds. To be honest, we actually found them softer than a lot of the hotels we stayed at in China.There dont seem to be many travel websites where you can book rooms at this hotel, but we booked by just emailing them thru the address on their website. Its standard policy for most Chinese hotels to completely ignore any email enquiries they receive, but I found the Bamboo Garden respond to enquiries really quickly during their office hours.If I go back to Beijing I'd definately stay at the Bamboo Garden again.

<Content>Lots of character in a nice location I stayed at the Bamboo Garden in early September for 4 nights. I was looking for a place with some character vs the usual 5-star properties, and Bamboo Garden fit the bill. My room was one of the standard suite rooms, with a front room containing Chinese-style furniture and a TV, and a bedroom with large (and somewhat hard) bed, new TV, and the A/C unit. The bedroom faced the front alley but was very quiet. The bathroom was small but functional and clean. There were a few issues but they didn't bother me. Your response may vary. The front room isn't the kind of place you'd want to sit and relax as the furniture is a little too severe. Some of the plaster on the walls near the bathroom was a little soft and showing signs of moisture damage. The hard bed would have been a concern if I had stayed longer, but I took sleeping pills the first few nights to help get over jet lag and really didn't notice.The best aspect of the hotel is its location in a Beijing hutong on the north side of the city. It is a 5-10 minute walk south of the Gulou subway station, down an alley off the main street. It is an old-style courtyard building, with some rooms in a newer-looking building on the inner courtyard (I didn't see these). Since it is not a 5-star hotel the prices for breakfast, Internet access, laundry, etc. are not unreasonable. The location means you are have lots of options. I ate several times at a dumpling place just down the alley from the hotel. They have an English menu probably because they are used to tourists from the hotel eating there, but mostly I saw Chinese eating there. There is a youth hostel a 5-minute walk south on the main street which has 10-yuan per hour Internet access and relatively inexpensive tours on offer. Another 5 minutes or so south is the Houhai Lake area with loads of restaurants, bars, and a few historic sights. I had a delightful day just walking around the hutongs and lakes. Being on the north side of Beijing it is relatively easy to get out to the Summer Palace and Great Wall. Taxis are cheap but traffic can make it difficult at times to reach other areas so I usually took the subway to get close and then a taxi the rest of the way.If I return to Beijing as a tourist I would stay here again. For a business trip, especially if my destination was the CBD over to the east, I would probably pick a 5-star property closer to my destination instead.
