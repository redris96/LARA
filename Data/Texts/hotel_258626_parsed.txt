<Content>Very disappointed! Ridiculous! This place should not even be open. My kids and I have stayed before and enjoyed it, but this time, the entire place is under renovation. No pool, no fitness center, and most importantly, no restaurant for lunch or dinner. The lobby is a disaster, and the usually helpful staff are cranky (with the exception of the bellman who kindly suggested the Embassy Suites when I said we would not be staying). I'm no princess, but having spent a long day traveling with 7 year old twins, I just wanted to get the kids fed and to sleep. I was not going to check in to the hotel, then take the kids out for dinner elsewhere, drive back (pay the $10 for parking) and get to sleep late to be awaken by jackhammers in the early am. None of this would have inspired a bad review had they just refunded my money and sent me on my way, BUT they charged me for a night's stay because I didn't give them 24 hours notice before cancelling the reservation. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WOULD BE NO RESTAURANT UNTIL I GOT TO THE HOTEL!Nothing on their web site or Expedia says anything about the restaurant being closed. So, this family of 3 will find a new place to stay during our biannual visits. No big loss for Prava I'm sure, but not the way to do business if you ask me.

<Content>Great for the price i paid, but... Stayed here one night in August of this year, the public facilities are very nice and are getting spruced up as the hotel is preparing to convert into a Le Meridien by next year (three floors are totally closed off for renovation). Had a similar experience as the guest below that posted about the worn furniture in the living room of the suite - i would assume that the furniture thats in the rooms is going to be trashed or sold off when the hotel is complete. The bedding is pretty nice and the bathrooms appear to already have undergone renovation. My room, suite 502, smelled awfully smoky, like the housekeeping staff had gone overboard with Febreze to disguise the smell. It improved overnight but was pretty bad upon check-in. Can't really complain as I paid about $47 (and that was with tax) on Priceline.com. However, upon inquiring at the front desk whether there was another room to switch to that smelled better, the clerk was sympathetic but told me they were overbooked by three rooms. He did say he would try and send up an 'ozone machine' whatever that is, but that never arrived much to my chagrin and to my girlfriends dismay as she's allergic to cigarette smoke and had a tough time sleeping. We liked the hotel alright overall but felt like in this instance we got the priceline room and kind of got the shaft. The low price would be the only thing that brings me back.

<Content>What's in a name This property is a former Hilton. The staff stated that it will be getting a new name in early 2009. It is well designed, open and airy. The staff was helpful and friendly, but not overly confident in their answers. There was a fee to use the business center. This is the type of location where you stay if you get a great rate not one I would recommend if you are paying rack rates.

<Content>Great Location..."OK" Hotel This hotel was OK. It is directly across the street from the Galleria, Macy's entrance (and covered parking garage). Parking is $6.50 per day at the hotel. Rooms are a bit outdated in decorations. Room stayed relatively warm even with the AC on high and around 68 degrees. Staff was friendly but not overly outgoing or helpful. There is no valet service available.I did not try the bar, but it does open around 5pm in the evenings. A restaurant is also onsite.

<Content>Wonderful Location! It was a very short walk across the street to shopping at the Galleria and other stores! The hotel itself had helpful staff, delicious breakfast, a game room, and great bar staff. The rooms had a great layout with a large bathroom and separate bedroom and living areas. Great place to stay!

<Content>Contradictions I stayed at this hotel over the July 4 weekend with my kids. The lobby/atrium is beautiful, with a fountain and sitting areas, that is reminiscent of an Embassy Suites. Service at the front desk was very good. I was having high hopes, but once we were upstairs, things started going downhill a bit.The carpet in the hallway was stained in many places. The room itself was a two-room suite. While that sounds big, it really wasn't. The furniture was average and worn looking, especially the sofa. The bathroom, however, was remodeled and very nice, with Crabtree  Evelyn toiletries. The beds, although doubles, were very comfortable and I slept well. So even within the room there were contradictions.I got the room at a great price on Hotwire. Based on the price and the nice lobby I would rate the overall experience above average.

<Content>Very nice room, excellent staff My girlfriend and I stayed here as sort of a trip away from the normal (we both live in the Dallas metroplex). I would consider this a four-star hotel - the rooms are spacious, decor is tasteful, and the service is top-notch. The elevators aren't great, but they are not Otis elevators, so this is understandable. Everything else exceeded our expectations. Staff were friendly and professional, no matter what we requested. Book on hotels.com or priceline.com and you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Love this place!!! I was surprised to see some of the negative reviews. I got this hotel for a steal on hotels.com and could not believe how beautiful it was. The room is clean and HUGE (I have a suite with a king bed) with modern items in it. The staff was very friendly when I came in, and the parking was only $6/night (No, it is not free, but I just came back from Boston where that hotel had parking for $39/night!) You can literally walk to the Galleria to shop and eat, not to mention this place has incredible access to major roads, eateries, and shopping. Complimentary in-room WiFi access (which you seem to have to pay for everywhere else). Very highly recommended!

<Content>Not Worth Your Money Well I booked this room thinking that it would be nice. The pool was very small, and the hot tub was warm not hot. The rooms needed to be updated. The shower didnt drain. And dont forget the parking you have to pay for. But the best thing was the beds were comfortable but small. Overall I wasnt impressed at all.

<Content>Unsave Hotel Lobby and Grounds When I arrived at the Prava, I noticed what appeared to be a vagrant 鈥渂ag lady鈥?chatting with one of the hotel鈥檚 bellmen. It alarmed me a little because I was bringing my two little children with me. The hotel itself is in need of some renovation. The phone in our suite did not work at all (also very alarming) and the hallways to and from the rooms were very hot! The air-conditioning in our room was not working properly 鈥?it clattered all night and never cooled the room off.The absolute last straw was as I was checking out of the hotel; one piece of my luggage was stolen right at the FRONT DESK. I reported it to the clerk as soon as I noticed it was missing (less than an hour), but nothing could be / or would be done about it. The hotel manager even went as far as to say 鈥渋t wasn鈥檛 a BIG loss.鈥?I found this very insulting, as the luggage contained a very expensive portable DVD player. I know that the hotel is NOT RESPONSISBLE for loss or theft, but they are responsible for having questionable people 鈥渏ust hanging out鈥?in their lobby and parking lot. I feel the hotel is unsafe for vacationers, especially those with children! I will not ever stay there again.

<Content>Brava Prava The Prava is behind the Galleria along the North Dallas Tollway at 635. There is currently a major construction site in front of the property. I heard no construction noise during my stay. I was there for a week while I worked close by on Beltline. IT's better than most extended stay properties in the area. The galleria is across the street if you are into that.I remember staying here when it was the Hilton Suites. Little has changed except the signage.The suite was nice size and comfy with stone vanity in the large bath. The drain in the tub was slow. Housekeeping was marginal but the room was fairly clean.The complimentary wireless internet access was sporadic. To sum up it was satisfactory for my needs. I'd stay again, but navigating the surface streets of north Dallas is terribly slow.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff Our group had a total of 5 rooms on the weekend of March 29; all were clean and comfortable. This hotel is literally across the street from the Galleria Mall (Red Garage entrance). The front desk staff were friendly and professional during 2 phone calls to make reservations and during check in and check out. Nice large bar and pool table; clean pool with large hot tub. The rooms at the Prava are basically setup like an Embassy Suites, but without the evening reception and free breakfast. But for $105, it was a great deal. Overnight parking-$6.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Best breakfast buffet, will definitely stay there again. Everything about this hotel was wonderful, the room was comfortable and extremely clean, it has everything you need  wish for, the bed was extremely comfortable, not the typical hotel room bed. Pillows were the best. The bathroom is very elegant, the toiletries are brand name, even the facial soap was great. They give you plenty of towels, not enough hangers but we called and 4 more hangers were delivered within a couple of minutes. The best breakfast buffet I have ever had. Whoever says Prava Suites' breakfast is not the best is flat out lying. In fact I would go back to this hotel just for their breakfast. The service was excellent, very friendly staff. Yes, you do have to pay for parking and at first I was a little mad because I'm not used to paying for parking at any hotel if it's not valet, but take my word for it, it's well worth it. We did have some problems with the room keys but were given new ones right away. Pool was good, water was a little cold but we told the front desk personnel and they immediately warmed it up. They do charge for local calls so don't be alarmed when you see a .75 charge per local call on your bill. Overall I'm very satisfied with the hotel, I'd have to say that 3.5 stars is too low for this hotel, I've stayed at 4  5 star hotels that do not offer a 3rd of the ammenities found at Prava Suites.

<Content>This is a GREAT Hotel This was a GREAT hotel. the staff is more then friendly, the rooms are clean there is a WONDERFUL buffet in the am that has GREAT food and made to order food... the pool was a little run down, however the water was clean and WARM (it is indoor) the hot tub was nice it looks older so it could give an impression that it was dirty but it wasn't. The work out room was pretty good, not the best but we were able to get a good workout in it. The room was kind of small.. we got a suite.... and the one downside to the room that we had did not have any outside windows... we overlooked the lobby so you could not open your window for fresh air...that was the only bad thing. I would stay here again and my three teenagers that my husband and I brought along had a great time. There is even a pool table that was in pretty good shape and provided some entertainment. Close to shopping as well!

<Content>Perfect location for enjoying after Christmas skating and shopping This suite worked out well for our family with children. We had easy walking access to skate and shop and the Starbucks in the mall which is open outside of mall hours. We were there to go the American Girl Store and it was an easy walk as well. Easy in/out of gated parking area to restaurants on Belt Line Road (every restaurant you can imagine and this is where you go to buy beer or wine as well)The kids enjoyed the indoor pool at the hotel and the staff were all friendly helpful. Room was clean, had mini frig, coffeemaker, microwave - love the separate living room. Would stay again.

Room was excellent, plenty of room and very clean.We did not use the restaurant because it seemed to be closed on the Saturday night we were there. Only downside was being charged for parking which is kind of unusual for hotels in this area.

Staff went over and above to please. Within walking distance to The Galleria Mall The only downside is they did not offer Hyatt points during the transition. Catering was good but I would recommend eating meals at The Galleria. Coffee was not good but Starbucks is a very short walk away.

<Content>Poor customer service I stayed at Prava Suites for 3 days in May 2007 as the Westin Galleria was fully booked. Hotel was OK, but the gym needs serious updating. My biggest issue was concerning some clothing items I left in the room. I called the next day and left a detailed message; no return call. Called again, left a message and asked for a return call; again, no answer. I'm not as upset about not getting my items back as I am about no answer/follow up by the hotel. The management needs to learn that customer service does not end once I've paid my bill.

<Content>Don't Take Any Valuables With You Our stay at the hotel started out good. My husband was attending a medical seminar and I came along to go shopping at the Galleria Mall. When we checked in we were given two vouchers for the breakfast buffet but we were staying two days. We were told only my husband would receive the vouchers because it was being paid for by the sponsor of the seminar. Later that evening we found an evelope under our door which contained two more vouchers for myself. A pleasant surprise. However, our stay went downhill the next day when upon returning from the Galleria for a break and to freshen up, I couldn't find an almost new powder compact I had left in the room. Later in the evening when I did a more extensive search I also discovered a pair of gold earrings were missing. I had hid them as best I could at the bottom of a bag since there are no safes in the room. After filing a report with management we were called a few days later and told only the maid and the person who checks the room after the maid leaves (who had left dirty towels hanging on the bathroom door) were in the room and they knew nothing about the missing items. The hotel is only responsible for items over $100 in value so we could file a report with the police department if we chose. Needless to say, we won't be staying at this hotel ever again.

<Content>Very Satisfied! Excellent Hotel and Great Location! The Prava Suites is literally across the street from the Galleria and about 4-5 blocks from another large mall, also, about 20 minutes from the Grapevine Outlet mall and the Allen Outlet mall....but enough about shopping. ....... The Prava was a great hotel! The rooms were roomy with a small living room, which contained a tv, small refrigerator, microwave and a sleeper sofa, also for those who are conducting business, internet access. The bed room area, had a large king bed and tv, large closet space....... nice CLEAN roomy bathroom. There is a bar downstairs, with a large screen tv and a seperate area with tables, chairs and a pool table, great space if your on a trip with a group of friends. Upon entering the hotel there is a beautiful water fountain and a nice area for dining, with a great menu selection for breakfast. Small but nice workout area, indoor pool and jacuzzi. For, the money, it's an excellent hotel!!!

<Content>Not what I expected If you are traveling for business, this is probably an OK hotel for you. However; I was traveling for leisure, and it did not meet my expectations. First - you have to pay for parking. Considering I felt I was already overpaying for my room, I was not happy about this. When we checked in, the front desk did not recognize the free breakfast promotion that was included with our reservation and we had to push for it. The front desk was also not very knowledgable or helpful when we asked for information about the area. On the way to our room, we noticed dirty dishes and trash in the hallway. Unbelievably, the dishes and trash were still there the day we checked out. They NEVER got cleaned up. The room was OK. It was very roomy and clean, but there was a large stain on the chair in our room. The door to our room was always jammed, so we had to basically kick it in each time we entered. The breakfast buffet was good in the courtyard. It was nice to be able to walk to the Galleria. We were staying at the hotel for a getaway, but it wasn't great. The pool smelled so strongly of chlorine and the temperature was unbelieveable. I know this is an indoor pool, but it was hotter than the hot tub. We couldn't even stand how hot the pool was, so we didn't get to use it. We complained to the front desk about the temperature, but they seemed oblivious to our request and said they would turn it down. They never did. We checked the next day and it was just as hot. We werent the only ones complaining. Bottom line...if you are on business and don't care about the extras, this will work for you. If you want to enjoy a hotel experience, don't go to the Prava Suites.

<Content>Service Not Galleria Quality Just because a hotel is across from the Galleria, does not mean it is an upscale hotel with upscale service. The hotel is a nice hotel, but for the price, it should be a lot better. The carpet in the halls and in the room we stayed in needs a good professional cleaning. The sofa bed needs to be re-upholstered. However, the beds were extremely comfortable. Our room had 2 TV's, however, the channel selection was extremely limited. The only kid-friendly channel was Cartoon Network. However, they do have games and movies you can order and have added to your bill.I did not like the fact that they charge $6.50 per night for parking without even asking for any vehicle information. In fact, the attendant at the desk saw my keys and assumed I had a rental car and charged me accordingly even though I never parked in their gated parking lot.The hotel has a business center where you can use the computer, internet and printer, but you must have a credit card to access any of it and they charge you per minute to surf, print, etc. (Just hope they don't have slow internet service or a slow printer). In my case, after several failed attempts to use the equipment in the business center to print out my airline boarding passes, hotel staff reluctantly allowed me to use the free computer at the consierge desk. It seems to me that such services should be free automatically for the price I paid for the room.The breakfast buffet (which is mediocre) is over priced at $14 per adult and about $7 per child plus tax (although the menu reads $12.95 per adult). I've been in hotels with similar rates and a full delicious breakfast buffet was included with the room.On the night we checked in, we had to request to have the linen changed on the sofa bed. There were crumbs in, on and around the sofa. In fact, we had to ask 3 times to have our room vaccuumed to remove snacks on the floor left by previous occupants. Also, twice we had to request an ample amount of towels and wash cloths be placed in our room.The hotels has a complimentary shuttle service within a limited area. However, they need to have their van detailed. Our driver and bellhop, Curtis, was very professional, polite, courteous, and always had a smile.Over all, for the money, I would stay some where else.

<Content>Big Let Down I was disappointed by the Prava Suites from the minute we pulled into the drive. When we got to the room, our key card would not work on the door. The light turned green but the door would not open. Rooms were large and clean but very outdated. The TV in the bedroom did not work and my husband had to fix it himself when the front desk did not answer the call. The hotel was overrun with children. We expected a more adult-focused hotel with the minimum check-in age advertised everywhere as 21-years old. At 10:30 PM on Sunday evening we attempted to visit the pool but there were literally 20-kids under the age of 12 screaming and running around wildly, as they were up and down the halls most of the weekend. The fitness facility was basically a playground overrun with kids as well. When we visited the bar and front desk asking to borrow a bottle opener they could not find one to let us use, even at the bar. The business center was not working and there is no printing availability from the guest room. Parking in a open, unsecured, uncovered, unguarded lot is $8 per night. There is no reason to pay for this parking. I usually stay at the Wyndham right across the tollway when in the Dallas metroplex and I wish I would have during this trip. Very, very disappointed. The only good thing was the location, but there are plenty other hotels in the area, in this price range to choose from.

<Content>Spacious, clean suites! We shared a King Suite w/ another couple with the understanding that we would be on the sofa bed. FYI, the sofa bed was not that comfy. Okay for one guest but not for a couple. Otherwise I have no complaints. The hotel is ideally located for shopping; the Galleria is literally across the street  the Valley View mall is down the street. The suite was spacious! Loved the double access to the big bath. Excellent toiletries is you're into that sort of thing. Very clean w/ free wifi. Other couple did say it was warm in their room but we were fine in the living area. The hotel is atrium-style inside; big  open. Only surprising thing is there was no complimentary bfast of any kind.

<Content>Sweet!!! What more can I say! I live in Salado Texas and was searching for a hotel for my daughters basketball team in Dallas ( state play-offs). Contacted Prava suites and spoke with the sales rep. Clint, explained that we had offers for other hotels but wanted a little more for our girls(indoor pool), CLint got us rooms for the same price the tournament dir.had for a hotel w/o a suite or indoor pool. Our stay was fablous: the room clean, beds compare w/ Westin Heavenly beds! service Great, Jose in the bar was fantastic!! The entire weekend could not have been better, Food was awsome. we walked across the street to the Galleria perfect location! I use to work at the Westin Galleria when I lived in Dallas and I know how much a room there is..believe me your throwing shopping $$$$ out the window if you don't stay at Prava Suites next time your in N.Dallas! Chuck Hernandez the room director is doing an awsome job! Keep up the Great Work Prava!!

<Content>Super pleased with Prava I have read mixed reviews about this place but booked it anyway mainly for the price of the suite. We paid $129 per night for a corner King Suite. It was a very big room with an awesome bed with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was very big and classy. I didn't feel anything was old or outdated. The interior of the hotel was very nice. We received free breakfast coupons for both nights we stayed. This was a full course breakfast bar with a make it to order chef as well. The only thing that I would have checked as not totally happy, was the parking lot. They charge you $6 a night to park. Other than that, we had not one complaint. I called at 11AM after we left the airport to ask for an early check in and they told me to come on in, the room is already waiting for you. Check in took all of 3 minutes with no problems. Checkout took all of 1 minute with no problems. The location of this place is great. It is right off the Dallas Tollway which can get you to all the major highways. It is just a mile south of Addison. There are a ton of very nice places to eat in Addison. We also went to Pete's Duelling Piano bar in Addison. It was a great place as well. It's a younger college age crowd though. From now on, I won't even bother shopping around for another place to stay. Prave has my future business when I'm in Dallas.

<Content>One of the "biggest bang for your buck" This hotel was great! Right next to the Galleria and walkable by crossing a small side street (unlike the Hilton Lincoln Center which is also next to the Galleria...but across a large freeway intersection). The room we got was huge! It is a suite (as all rooms in this hotel are) with a large living room area with typical business desk/chair, sofa/sofabed, tv, microwave/mini fridge. The adjoining bedroom also has its own TV and though a bit small, still had plenty of room for us to move around. The bathroom is connected to the bedroom and living room with separate doorways and has black granite counters and LOTS of space!!!! The front desk staff was courteous and extremely helpful. The atrium was beautiful. THe only complaints (and I'm really being nit-picky) are that they charge $6 for parking, and the view we got outside of our 4 beautiful large windows was an ugly empty lot. The breakfast buffet was great except it was a little pricey at $13 per person. I only wished we stayed for more than one night...They also provide a free shuttle service to anywhere within a 3 mile radius. And, besides being next to the Galleria, it is within walking distance to another large mall (forgot the name), Linens n Things, Crate and Barrel, and some other large department stores...We paid about $100 a night including all taxes and fees...great value for what you get!

<Content>Nice Room, Cold Pool The rooms are nicely decorated and clean. Pool was not heated. We got a suite which had a large wall separating the thin living room from the bedroom. The hotel is right across the street from the Galleria, within walking distance (maybe 100 yards to the Macys entrance).NOTE: As mentioned below, the pool was not heated (and this was back in June of 2006 - so it must never be heated). This made the indoor pool too cold to use - even in June!!! Choose with caution if you have young ones expecting to use the pool. If they would fix this, I would gladly stay again.

<Content>Cold Pool This was my first time back since it changed from the Hilton brand. Not much has changed. The one disappointment was that the indoor pool was not heated. My 6 year old really wanted to swim and we were only able to last for a short time because the water was very cold. With that said this is still a very nice place to stay. Its very close to some excellent restaurants and shopping. Its also very easy to get on and off the major highways.Watch out for the morning breakfast buffet in the atrium. Its good, but not worth $28 plus tip for two. I will probably stay here again.

<Content>Would Definitely Stay Again We just got back from our first stay at the Prava and we loved it! The lobby is gorgeous and the staff welcoming. We thought the rooms were very nice, actually nicer than those at the various Embassy Suites that we have stayed at. The rooms are quiet and clean, they almost seem new. The sitting area is very nice and the convenience of having the bathroom open off both the sitting area and the bedroom is a great feature. When the doors to the bedroom were closed, little noise could be heard from the sitting area. We used both the work-out room and my daughters used the pool, and we found both to be clean and well kept. We booked through Expedia and only paid approximately $100 a night so we found the Prava to be a great value!!The only slight complaint we had was the food we ordered from room service was just average. However, we had the breakfast buffet the morning we left and we found it to be good. We will definitely be back! Oh, and the beautiful glass elevators were working just fine when we were there :)

<Content>Would not go back!!! BEWARE! Wow. Where do I begin?This is an average hotel at best in a good location. But they have some serious problems.I would normally not complain about something like this, but the elevators were SO SLOOOWW. I am talking 15-20 minutes to get to the lobby everytime. They really have a problem here. Everyone was was complaining about this!The rooms were just okay. Nothing special.The front photo that looks so glamorous is very deceiving. This is actually from the backside of the hotel. It faces an ugly lot that is adjacent to Noel street. The best part of the entire hotel is the lobby. You walk in and think wow. But then you experience the rest of the hotel.I also had a major problem I with the front desk (with my bill) that I won't bore you with. It was just not a good situation.The hotel is just across the street from the Galleria Mall (on the east side). Food was okay, less than average.There is an Embassy Suites just to the North about one block that would be a much better selection.

<Content>nothing but problems Stayed mid week when almost all other hotels had no rooms. Rooms were on small side, and as a new hotel was surprised with carpet fraying everywhere. Was unable to sleep as the elevator machine noise was constant all night. Had both a meal at resturant and room service, neither of which the kitchen could provide either hot or correctly. Ice machines didn't work, in my opinion rooms $239 price the $6 parking at a surburban hotel seemed an insult. Tried to call the if you are not satisfied number but got machine. And when I tried the TV express check out, it was not available. Overall, with as many hotels avvailable, this would be the last one I would stay at.

<Content>Love this place! This is our favorite hotel in Dallas. We were here for a short get-away. This is a very quiet hotel! When we arrived, the place was overrun with teenagers, either a school group or a sports team. We checked in, fearing a sleepless night. But there were no teenagers on our floor that we could hear. Our room, a King non-smoking, faced the atrium, which was (to our surprise) also quiet. The bed was perhaps the most comfortable hotel bed! The rooms are fairly roomy, with a separate bedroom. Four people would be cramped, but it was sufficient for two people. the living room area features a sleeper sofa (either queen or full,) a comfy upholstered chair, a desk with internet access, an entertainment center, and coffee pot. The room was definitely NON-smoking, and NOT saturated with air freshners to hide the smoky smell. The hot water was hot, and plenty of it (I know that is how it is SUPPOSED to be, but isn't always so in all hotels. I've stayed in 5-stars that were out of hot water by 7am!) There was a coffee pot in the living room, and USA Today outside the door each morning. The location is a plus, as well. Easy to find, just off the Dallas Tollway, a couple of right turns and you're there. It is right across from the Galleria (Macy's garage side,) and adjacent to the Container Store, ZGallerie, and numerous other stores. It is very close to Valley View Mall, to the east, and The Great Outdoors to the west. Parking was the only issue, and only once. The parking lot fills up very quickly. We were booked here by Hotwire the first time. We loved it so much we started booking direct with the hotel. We've been back several times and haven't had a bad experience yet.

<Content>Good for Business Travelers I stayed there one night on a recent trip to Dallas on business. This was a very good hotel for business travelers. Close to major freeways and the Galleria shopping mall is across the street. Everything was very clean and relatively new. Good room service food, free Internet access, seperate sleeping area, very clean room and friendly staff. There was a morning buffet at your typical business hotel price but you can also special order food as well.A couple of negatives is that my room located on the top floor seemed to be near the building ac unit. So all night I heard a fan blowing. I didnt ask to switch since it was late. Not sure if this was in all of the rooms or just the one I was in. Also, they charge for parking. Though not unusual, it probably pays for the attendant less gate they have there.

<Content>Don't bother--much better in town As a Diamond member I stay at Hilton's once a week. This was nothng special--$200/night for what--tiny room, no serivce and zero upgrades for Diamond. No thanks, and will stay elsewhere when in town. They need to learn that Diamond members are special guests and deserve--yes deserve an upgrade for staying with them every week. If not can stay elsewhere. If in Dallas I would not stay here.

<Content>A hidden gem at the Galleria! First and foremost, I spend a lot of time looking for those hidden deals that can't be beat, especially when I want to book a weekend getaway to Dallas. Well, after booking this property for $65 a night through Hotwire, I can honestly say, dollar for dollar, you will not get a better deal in Dallas, or Ft. Worth, period!Check in was quick and the desk rep was very friendly. We did ask for a bellhop cart during check in and, the hotel staff was slow to respond nevertheless, it didn't bother me enough to file a complaint and we brought our luggage up to the room on our own.This hotel, first and foremost, is absolutely clean, spacious and well-appointed. The suites have divided rooms and the bathroom has an entry from the bedroom AND living room areas. The beds were firm, the four pillows per each double bed were exceptionally soft and the A/C work wonderfully. High speed access was a snap and the desk work area had two excellent chairs available. The sleeper sofa was also fairly comfortable.The hotel is located near Alpha and Noel St. adjacent to the Macy's entrance at the Galleria Mall. It doesn't get any better than that with respect to hotel properties in that area.My only complains about the hotel were really nothing to sneeze at. You are provided a code which gives you access to paid parking across the street at $6 per day. Second, please be wary of the complimentary breakfast. You are receiving a free breakfast only for those items at the serving area, which are identified as continental breakfast items. Otherwise, you pay $7 per person.Overall, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Hilton Suites is a winner in my book!

<Content>Huge room! Stayed there last week for business - loved my huge 2-room suite, which felt larger than my first apartment! Comfortable bedding, 2 TVs, clean, quiet, professional staff. Proximity to the Galleria a plus. Breakfast (only meal I ate in the hotel) was average. 2 small complaints ... the elevators made an odd humming sound, audible from both the lobby and my room (which, admittedly was close to the elevator bank, #1102) ... once I figured out what the heck it was it was fine. Other issue, my coffee service was not refreshed by housekeeping, so I went without java on day 2. Will definitely stay here again, tho.

<Content>Great value! Booked the room on Priceline and got a great deal. Parking was an additional $6 a day. They offer big rooms with living area, large bath with two entrances, and great beds. They gladly gave me a late check out (unheard of these days) and no one knocked on my door to disturb me. Over all a great value. Still can not believe a 1:30 check out! I never write reviews, but this one deserved it.

<Content>Absolutely reccommend I loved this hotel.Rooms are HUGE! I had windows in both the living room and bedroom. I am sure it was just a standard room, however it was on an end/corner.High Speed worked great. Parking was easy, except you have to remember a code to exit. My company is budget minded, so I may not be able to stay here again since with tax and all it was $200 ish a night. Everything was new and clean.

<Content>Upscale Garden Inn or Downscale Embassy Suites? My suite was smaller than an Embassy Suites 1BR but larger than a Hilton Garden Inn suite. Everything worked and was clean. Room service was a little slow but not out of line. Reasonable value for the area but wouldn't go out of the way to stay there.

<Content>Great hotel, great rates Rooms were nice, clean, and front desk staff was eager to please. Used the shuttle service and that was awesome also, on time everytime. The only thing I would like others to know is that even though it is a suite hotel, the rooms are not suite sized. However, they are very nice rooms.

<Content>Pretty good choice I liked this hotel, particularly the suite-style rooms. Mine, which I believe was standard, had a separate living room with an office/dining area. The whole place was very clean and efficient. They do get you for some petty charges -- four dollars to park, for instance -- but I still found it to be a good value. My only caution is the location. It's in a nice part of town, across the street from an up-scale shopping mall and convenient to the highways, but it is not very close to downtown Dallas. As long as you don't mind being in the 'burbs you'll be fine.

<Content>Fantastic weekend! Stayed at the Hilton North July 1st and 2nd. Staff extremely courteous, had a late check in which only took around 3 minutes. Room was not too small, but very clean, well maintained and large bathrooms. Pool area was a bit dirty and in need of cleaning but all in all was enjoyable. Waitstaff, bartenders and concierge very pleasant and felt comfortable asking questions for directions, etc. A real plus is the fact you can walk across the street to the Galleria, no fighting for parking. Fantastic hotel and would definately recommend to future travelers. Great job Hilton!

<Content>great location nice hotel Other than the sign, you'll think you're staying at an Embassy Suites. The location is great, you're only a couple of blocks from I-635 and the Dallas Pkwy North (toll Road). You can take the toll road straight into downtown, we also took it to connect to the 12 loop to go over to Cowboys Red River, (we had to try a cowboy bar). Both are only 15 minutes away. Going North we went to Carson's Live in Addison a huge nightclub up the road about 5 miles ($12.00 cab ride). And of course the Galleria is across the street, so it was pretty easy getting around for our first trip to Dallas. The people at the hotel were great. Note that there is no smoking at the bar. While it feels like an Embassy Suites, we thought the rooms/suites were nicer. The place is very clean, all the people were great, everyone seemed to really care about our stay. A great value, a fun weekend, we'll stay again.

<Content>Did not like it at all I read all the reviews here and booked this hotel for 6 nights, as I wanted to be near Galleria.I was quite disappointed. - Rooms are not at all large - your basic hotel room just divided by a wall into a bedroom and a living room - View of the abandoned building across the street did not add to its charm - Room was dark with small windows, even though was facing outside - Constant noise from the outside and inside - Located next to the laundry room, so I was suffocating from the detergent smell Staff ignored the fact that I was a Gold card holder with Hilton, no upgrade was offered. Moreover, free breakfast that was supposed to be provided was only available in the lounge till 9:30. I showed up later and had to talk to several confused people in the restaurant, who said I should go find someone to get some voucher. I did not bother and paid for it, but decided to move out. Paid more for the room at Westin, but certainly got a better room and much better service.

<Content>Just get a room away from the party room! Wonderful location across the street from Macy's in the Galleria. My wife could walk across the street and I didn't have to fight the lines to drive her over there! Our visit was during the Christmas holidays, so the location is expecially prime. Rooms are very comfortable, and the service is excellent. Parking is very convenient and is inexpensive to free, depending if the gate is up or down. However, should request a room facing out from the atrium lobby, and on the upper floors. The atrium design funnelled the noise from a band playing for a private party directly into our room. The room was on the fourth floor with one floor between us and the party on the second, directly beneath us. It was worth it for the location, but just a word of caution for those not interested in participating indirectly in someone else's christmas party! The lot was full for the party, but a gracious staff person parked our car in the short term area free of charge.
