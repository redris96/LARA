<Content>Excellent Hotel This is an older hotel so the rooms are not large. Bathroom was a little on the small side, as was the TV. Overall though, we really enjoyed our stay at the Mayflower. The bed in our room was very comfortable -- better than your average 3* hotel bed --  they also provided bathrobes. We stayed during a snowstorm so we really appreciated the fact that the hotel has a good restaurant (Andalucia -- Spanish tapas) with excellent food  reasonable prices. There's also quite a good bar. We found the staff to be very friendly  helpful, plus the hotel is in a great location right in the center of Seattle. I'd highly recommend this hotel as great value for money.

<Content>Nice but small We spent a snowy night in Seattle, after attending the 5th ave Theatre in Seattle. It was a little walk which we enjoyed in the vibrant city. The room was small and not that great. The valet parking being included in the rate was a bonus. The location is close to everthing. We shopped and walked to the Market in the morning where we ate a fantastic breakfast overlooking the waterfront at Lowells in the Market.

<Content>First Class Hotel in Every Way My husband and I spent 3 nights in this excellent and charming hotel during the first part of November and were delighted with our experience there. Selene, the extremely professional representative who assisted me with my reservation, couldn't have been more helpful. I told her it was a special occasion (my birthday) and she offered us a luxurious, corner location, two room suite, complete with two bathrooms, perfect view of the space needle, and even the deep red decor I was hoping for. Every single employee we encountered focused on making our stay as special as possible, beginning with the cheerful, very knowledgeable Bridgitte who greeted us at the front desk and went out of her way to ensure we had every detail we might need to add to our comfort.This hotel also has an excellent restaurant, Andaluca, where we ate breakfast in the mornings. Afternoon rest stops were spent in Oliver's, a very cozy, intimate bar filled with light from an enormous wall of windows overlooking the Seattle street scene and offering superb drinks and delicious menu items.The Mayflower Park is also located just four blocks from Pike Place Market, which enabled us to walk to every location we wanted to visit while in town, from restaurants to shopping to the theatre. It's also connected to the monorail, which makes it effortless to whiz to the Space Needle for dinner. For those of you looking for a beautifully furnished, timeless and intimate boutique hotel located in the heart of downtown and providing superb service, food and ambience, I can't say enough about selecting the Mayflower Park for your next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Nice room in Downtown Seattle A business trip to Seattle brought me to the Mayflower Park hotel for two nights. Although I had lived in Seattle for much of my life, I'd never noticed the place or (amazingly enough) been to Andaluca or the hotel bar.Overall, this was a fine place to stay; it's a solid downtown hotel.LOCATIONThe hotel is centrally located, at 4th and Olive. Although I didn't do much sightseeing, it's walking distance from a number of Seattle attractions. Close to the Market, close to the Waterfront, close to Westlake... you get the idea.Mind you, central location does have its occasional downside as well. There's a lot of traffic on the surrounding streets, and I did notice a little traffic noise in my room. It didn't bother me, but if you're sensitive to that, you might want to look elsewhere.ROOMSI stayed in a Deluxe guestroom (a step up from the Classic), which had plenty of room and a nice configuration. There was a large bar area that had the coffee maker and a sink, which was nice to have. The workstation was large and functional, perfect if you need to work on the road. The bathroom was small an unspectacular, but nicely appointed and perfectly functional. I'm not a huge fan of Queen Anne Style (as the hotel describes their decor), but it seemed pretty understated and didn't bother me.There was no noise from other rooms or the hallway, but there was some early-morning street noise. Know your tolerance for traffic noise and plan accordingly.FACILITIES/LOBBYThe lobby is small, but nicely appointed. Not much to say about it.Oliver's, the bar, is a good place to have a drink, and always looked inviting when I returned to the hotel. Bar help was friendly and they have Pike Place Ale on tap, always a plus for me. Aside from WiFi, I didn't use the business facilities, so I'm not sure what they're like. There's also a workout room, which I never found time to use.RESTAURANTI ate at the very chic-looking Andaluca the first night I was there and was very pleased. I sat at the small bar in the restaurant and got great service. If you like shellfish, don't miss the baked mussels; they were stunningly good, and went really well with a glass of Spanish bubbly. I wanted to go back the second night but had already made other dinner plans. I'll go back when I get the chance.STAFFHotel staff was helpful and tolerant of my questions and occasional mishaps (like losing my room key). I'd describe the help as professional if slightly aloof in some instances -- not a problem for me, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by warmth.Bar and restaurant staff were professional, attentive, and friendly.SUMMARYIf you're looking for a decent hotel in a great downtown location, this should fit the bill. The restaurant and bar are the strong points, although everything was certainly better-than-acceptable. For a two-night business trip, the location and amenities were just what I needed, and the stay was uneventful. I'd rate it at the lower end of above average

<Content>Great Hotel and Staff This hotel was great. Very clean and perfect location.We had wonderful service dealing with everyone employed by the hotel and even were upgraded to a suite without asking for that. Britney at the front desk was completely amazing and certainly knows what customer service means. They are very lucky to have her.This is an old gem that has been kept up to standards that travelers should expect. Hope you choose to stay here, I am pretty picky so this was a very pleasant surprise.

<Content>So-So in Seattle We stayed 2 nights here based on reviews on tripadvisor. First of all, this hotel is in an excellent location. For families, it's close to the pike's place market. For hipsters, it's close to Belltown. It's located on the same block as a popular mall and corporate shopping. For those who plan to hit center city, the monorail is conveniently right next door. All staff was helpful, polite, and professional. We were able to check in early with no problems. The bellmen were helpful with city tips and the front desk was always pleasant. Our room was a bit cramped, but the bed was comfortable and the room was very clean and tidy.

<Content>Excellent Choice for Seattle Visit! My husband and I decided to take a long weekend in Seattle. Having never been there, I read a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor and selected the Mayflower Park Hotel for our stay at the recommendations of many. It was great! Our flights came in very early and left really late, but they were able to accommodate an early check in and a late check out with no problems. I had booked their Rise and Shine package, so we had a delicious breakfast sent up to our room every morning. And it's true what others say---Olivers is great! We enjoyed their cocktails (especially the infused Bloody Mary) each night before having dinner in town. The front desk staff and concierge was very helpful and polite. We got a room on the 12th floor in the corner, so we had great views. Although the room was smaller than an average sized hotel room, it suit our needs perfectly. Also, at the suggestion of others on tripadvisor we took the Downtown Airporter through Grayline for $18 each, roundtrip. It picked up/dropped off at the Westin less than 2 minutes away from the Mayflower Park. This was a super easy alternative to taking a cab from the airport/downtown. We had considered renting a car, but glad we didn't in the end. Everything was easy to get to without a car. Location wise the hotel was perfect for our needs. We walked to the Pikes Place Market everyday. Also, having the monorail and Westlake Center (food court/shopping) attached to the hotel made travel to Seattle Center easy. We celebrated one night with dinner at the Space Needle restaurant. It is overpriced as other say, but it was worth the experience and views. Plus you have to consider the $16 per person you'd spend just to go up it, so it worked out! We also went on the Savory Seattle Food tour through The Pikes Place Market and it was great! Well worth the time and money. Overall, we had a great trip to Seattle and the Mayflower Park Hotel is probably the biggest reason why! Thanks to everyone on Tripadvisor for your suggestions!

<Content>Excellent Service, Very Good Facility We booked a delux room for a long weekend getaway in April 2008 but arrived too early in the morning, so they smiled and gave us a corner suite instead! Well furnished, two small rooms, but certainly enough space. The hotel is a heritage building perfectly located between Macy's and Nordstrom's, right next to the monorail, a few blocks from the major theatres and a short walk to Pike Place Market. We only had breakfast in their restaurant, but it was very good. Highly recommended.

<Content>Good value for money We stayed here for two nights and found it to be a great little hotel with a convenient downtown location, helpful staff and comfortable lobby. The only downside was that the room was on the small side and the bathroom was a bit dated and not as clean as we would have liked. We had to catch a late afternoon plane and the staff kindly let us stay two hours past checkout time, after which they stored our bags downstairs while we went off for a late lunch/early dinner. When we returned the taxi was waiting and our bags were already loaded inside. Now that's what I call efficiency!

<Content>Good place to stay downtown The Mayflower Park was perfectly fine for our recent trip to the Seattle. The room was small but very clean and the staff were quite friendly and eager to please. Best of all, the hotel is within walking distance of any place we cared to reach downtown. Further, it a great value compared with other downtown hotels we considered. While the hotel experience itself was forgettable, we didn't go to Seattle to hang out in our room, so would definitely stay there again should we return.

<Content>Good Choice - visit Seattle without rental car This is a well managed historic hotel in a good downtown location, convenient to mass transportation, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, a Great location to use as a base to explore Seattle. We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights at the beginning of a 10 day trip to the Puget Sound area and returned for the last two nights. Our first room was a very nice large deluxe room on an upper floor with a king bed and sitting area with sofa, two chairs and coffee table. We slept with the window open a couple of inches and were not bothered by street sounds. Rooms in Seattle were scarce at the end of our trip, so we emailed the hotel after getting the first reservation and were able to get a smaller room, about the size of a standard Marriott room, with two queen beds and two bathrooms on a lower floor at the same price. Both were very nice rooms, great for sleeping with good maid service, but being an historic building, the bathrooms were smaller than bathrooms found in newer properties. The front desk staff provided good recommendations for dining and were extremely pleasant. On the evening of our arrival we had a light meal and drinks in Oliver鈥檚, the hotel lounge. The food and service was good. Preferring a light breakfast, we used coffee shops and cafes out of the hotel. We opted to pick up our rental car at a downtown location at the end of our 1st two nights, preferring to explore large cities on foot and eliminated both the valet parking and airport rental car concession fees. Gray Line Downtown Airporter bus service ($18pp roundtrip) from SeaTac to the nearby Weston Hotel worked well and we walked the two blocks to the Mayflower Park. Being at the end of the Monorail to Seattle Center was a plus and we also took advantage of the free daytime downtown public bus, using the nearby underground bus tunnel. There are many things to see and do in Seattle. This hotel worked well for us and we would definitely use it again.

<Content>Great location The Mayflower Park had attentive service and a great location. It was an easy walk to Pike's Place Market and attached to the Westlake Mall where you can access the monorail. We opted for the deluxe room to gain a little more area and were glad we did. We had a corner room with 3 windows on 2 walls and we had lots of light. As high as we were, it was surprising to still be able to hear the traffic so well. I guess we were tired enough at night that it did not really turn into an issue. The bathroom is very small with a pedestal sink. A small glass shelf above the sink is where I removed my contacs and I really prefer a vanity area. I estimated about 20 inches at the most between the sink and tub. The bathroom was definitely my least favorite thing about the room. The elevators were unbelievably slow and we spent a lot of time during our several day stay waiting on them. I think this might be a better one night stay place with a good rate from a Priceline type internet booking.

<Content>Great accommodations We stayed at The Mayflower Hotel on Saturday, September 13th, the night before we left for our Alaskan cruise. The rooms are not large, but we were extremely happy with the room. The decor was very classic and the beds super comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel. It's just a short couple blocks to the Market which we visited in the afternoon. The monorail to the Space Needle is attached to the hotel which is extremely convenient. That evening we walked back down to the Market area for dinner and again in the morning before our flight for breakfast.

<Content>great location downtown I am currently staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel. My husband, son and I stayed here the first night after arriving in Seattle. We have returned to stay two nights more at the end of our travels, before flying out of Sea-Tac airport. Contact the hotel directly for a rate, as we got a cheaper one going through them directly rather than online... (AAA discount)The Mayflower is a nice, older, hotel right in the heart of downtown Seattle. I have to add that there are many hotels near this location most very expensive, and just 6 blocks away are a few that are cheaper...anything cheaper than the Mayflower will land you in a much less desirable location. The Mayflower is a very old building that has been renovated in the 90's, yet is is still very clean, the decor is like saying at a fancy mother in laws house....The single bedroom is very small but for a night it is fine, the three of us barely fit with luggage and a portacrib..This second time we are in a delux queen room (they upgraded us for free) it is a great size for the three of us. The bathrooms in both of our rooms have been very nice, clean, tiny, but tastefully done. The front desk is really warm and friendly, and the restaurant and bar on site are great too. Hope you enjoy it.

<Content>Best hotel in downtown Seattle This is the best location in downtown Seattle. It is also the best priced hotel for this class of hotel in downtown. I use to live in Seattle and always walked by this hotel and would look in through the large window where the bar is located and would always want to go inside. It has a warm and inviting look to it and I was not one bit disspointed. First of all, the staff is excellent. From the valet that greets you when you drive up, to the front desk personnel, and the personnel that maintains the rooms, everyone is superb. The room was very nice with great beds and wonderful bed linens. The bathroom is a bit small but this is the price you pay for staying in an older hotel in the heart of downtown. The small bathroom was a small sacrifice considering the hotel has rooms with two queen size beds and is located on the same block as Westlake center and is only a few blocks to Pike Place Market. The rooms are also beautifully renovated and the property does not show its age.As I mentioned, you could not get a better location. It is located on the same block as Westlake Center. From here you can take the monorail to the Seattle Center. Nordstrom is only a block away and Pike Place is about three blocks away. I finally did go to the beautiful bar inside the hotel I use to look at years ago as I walked by and it was wonderful. They have some great drinks on the menu and you can order food here as well. We only had breakfast in the hotel's restaurant and it was excellent.

<Content>As previously mentioned, GREAT LOCATION! We stayed at this hotel on the first night of our Seattle  Vancouver trip and was pleasantly surprised by it. The place is a European style hotel (in furnishings and size), but it was quite confortable and clean. It was also a good value overall compared to other hotels of this caliber--just be sure to check their website for special packages. Ours included the room, valet parking (which is normally a crazy $30/night--normal for downtown, though), and a $20 gas card for each night. The front desk person and manager didn't have my change to this certain package from just a room and were inflexible about giving it to me at first. That was pretty disappointing, but we got a call a couple of hours later stating that they would give us it afterall.The location was superb--VERY close to delicious Dahlia Lounge(for dinner) and Lola (for breakfast--have the Greek scramble). It is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and it sounded like an attached monorail ride to the Seattle Center.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Mayflower pre cruise. I picked it based on reviews I read here and the location of the hotel. I was very pleased with my choice. The location was fabulous. Since it's connected to the monorail station it was very easy to get to the Space Needle and back, then we walked every where else. We were only 3 to 4 blocks from Pikes Market a very easy walk there and back. The staff there could have not been more helpful or eager to help. They were on the spot to get our luggage to the rooms and were very friendly. I will add the bellman staff were some of the most handsome I'd ever seen. I plan to go back to Seattle and would definitely stay there again. The beds were super comfortable and the rooms were very spacious. A great value in my opinion!

<Content>Beautiful Restored Hotel We really enjoyed the Mayflower Park Hotel. From our check-in to our check-out the staff was outstanding the Hotel beautifully maintained. Our original room had only one hight stand and reading light and we asked for a different room. Robert the desk clerk ,was very acomodating and cheked around until he found a room that would work. The Hotel is a Historic Hotel of America and is truly a gem. The location is fantastic. It is connected to a shopping center, however, the entrance is so hidden that yo would not know it was there. The monorail station is in the center so it is very convenient to get to the Space Needle. You can walk to restaurants and shopping.We actually stayed here 2 times on our trip. One night on our way to the Jan Juans, and 2 nights after we returned. We had 2 different rooms and both were beautifully appointed with all the amenities.The staff is very friendly and helpful. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel.

<Content>Can't Beat It The Mayflower Park is an excellent choice for price, location, friendly knowledgeable staff etc. My wife and I stayed in their classic room ( Room 1106) this is a corner room looking out 4th and mall area. If someone travels with a lot of baggage, then I would suggest a larger room. Otherwise the room was clean and sufficient for two people. We visited a couple larger hotels, but found them not as relaxing and people everywhere. It was like being out in the streets in their lobby's. Bottom line folks...we would happily make another reservation at the Mayflower Park!

<Content>Great location and service We had not been to Seattle in a few years and we wanted to find an nice hotel in downtown that was reasonably priced. The Mayflower Park met all these criteria. So we took Amtrak from Portland to Seattle (a great ride in both directions) and checked in at the Mayflower.When we checked in, the front desk got us a very quiet room that actually had two separate bathrooms (it was nice to be able to spread out). The service was excellent throughout and we got some good tips from the concierge on what to do and where to eat.The location was excellent, a few blocks away from the Pike Street Market and right at the termini of both the monorail and the new streetcar to Lake Union. In addition, downtown buses are free so we only needed a taxi once (after a tiring day and evening on the waterfront).

<Content>Great Location Got a room via HOTWIRE for the 1st week in July 08. I鈥檓 not sure what sort of room they would call it, but it was probably the standard accommodation for 2 people. It was small yet efficient. Perfect for a one-night stay, but probably better to opt for a bigger room if staying longer. Also, the d茅cor is traditional 鈥?not the usual modern or contemporary that I鈥檇 prefer. The bathroom was tiny but the water pressure okay. The location was ideal. Walking distance to several of the downtown attractions. Concierge, check-in/out and bellhop service was efficient and professional. Although I don鈥檛 have any complaints about this hotel, I鈥檇 probably opt to stay elsewhere only because the d茅cor of the room did not suit me.

<Content>Responsive Staff impresses! Our party of 5 stayed here in two rooms for one night after disembarking from our cruise. I called from the pier at 8am to see if we could check our luggage in the lobby while we wandered around Seattle's downtown since I knew we could not check into our room until 3 or 4pm. Much to my surprise, they told me one of our rooms was available so they were happy to check us in. We arrived by taxi at 9am and checked into that room. The other room was ready by Noon, and they contacted me by cell phone to let me know we were free to pick up our other room card when we were ready.One person in our party is recovering from knee surgery, and was limping quite pronouncedly after overdoing it on an excursion the day before. The hotel staff made known to me that they do have a wheelchair on the property and said they would be happy to get it out of storage if we could use it. I thought that was a great idea, but my relative said no and opted to walk a little bit and then rest in the room while the rest of us adventured. Pike's Place Market was an easy 3 blocks away, and the monorail stop is just a block away. The 2nd floor of the hotel links to the Westlake Center Mall which we enjoyed, and there is lots of shopping available around this hotel's location.We had one room with 1 queen bed, and another room with 2 queen beds. Both were clean, with comfortable beds. The 2-queen room had a flat screen TV while the 1-queen room had a normal model. Both had desks with chairs, cozy sitting chairs, and free wireless connection. The shower/bath was great with plenty of hot water and terrific pressure. The decor is very charming, and it was quiet--we never heard any noise from neighbors or otherwise. One of us ate in Andaluca for breakfast (opens at 6:30am) and it was nice but pricey ($11-16). The rest opted for Starbuck's which is only a half block down 4th Ave. For lunch, we loved P.F. Chang's which was just around the corner. We enjoyed our stay very much, and would like to return when we have more time to spend in Seattle. All the staff, from the desk attendants to the bellmen to the concierge, were very warm and responsive to our questions and needs. Wonderful experience!

We had a nice double room with queen beds - excellent choice. Large mall close by and monorail to Space Needle is a few blocks away. Highly recommmend!

<Content>Ideal location, good value We stayed for four nights at the Mayflower for a short vacation, and the location was ideal. Easy walking distance to Pike Market, Belltown and only about a 10-minute walk to Capitol Hill. Rooms are pretty basic, but we booked a good rate (average of $209/night) from Friday night to Tuesday. Never ate at the restaurant but the hotel does a have a limited 24-hour room service menu.Ultimately, great location for a very walkable city.

<Content>Charming! Stayed here for a work meeting. Although the rooms are not large, they are very well maintained and comfortable. Fabulous beds with great linens. Close to Pike's Market, great restaurants and shopping. Can't forget to mention the hotel bar, Oliver's. Great ambiance and great drinks including their signature drink - the Paradigm Shift. A quality boutique hotel!

<Content>Great hotel, terrific location The Mayflower Hotel is a lovely property in a great location in downtown Seattle. The service was great, especially at the concierge desk, which was extremely helpful. I was especially impressed with the subtle but appropriate concern for security that I noted at the front desk. The only small problem we encountered once or twice was in getting a taxi, which the doorman has to hail because there is no space on the street for taxis to wait in. There are LOTS of great restaurants, shopping, and even movies within walking distance, and the monorail station is just a block away. For relaxation, the chocolate martinis in the lobby bar (Oliver's) come highly recommended! The building is old, built in 1927, and truly has classical elegance and lots of personality. The rooms are lovely, but the bathrooms are old style, with only a minimum of shelf space for cosmetics and toiletries.

<Content>What a Gem! Just returned from our second delightful stay this year at the Mayflower Park. We had a 5th floor suite -- lovely sitting room with separate bedroom. My husband normally rises earlier than I so this is a perfect arrangement for us. A wet sink bar with coffee maker in the sitting room allows him to sit at the desk to write while he enjoys morning coffee. Comfy sofa, armchair with ottoman and cocktail table and windows on two sides make this room a pleasant place to hang out. We enjoyed a terrific lunch and breakfast the next day in Andaluca and had a nightcap in Oliver's after the baseball game. Both rooms are attractive and friendly environments. This hotel is a real winner and we feel totally at home staying there. We'll be back...

<Content>Excellent Choice We stayed one night before an Alaskan cruise. The location could not have been better. We could easily walk, shop, and sightsee. We probably had the most fun that evening in the bar, Olivers. We talked to locals and enjoyed the people watching-sit at the bar to enjoy the views. The bartenders were nice and the drinks were good. Our room was a good size with a small but very clean recently remodeled bathroom. I would stay here again when I return to the city.

<Content>DO NOT have your WEDDING here!!! The wedding party booked out the hotel. Friday friends met up at the lounge, Oliver's, we were at least 50 people. I think the bartender was a little overwhelmed. 50 people in a 175 capacity room would seem normal, but apparently not.Wedding day, Saturday: the brides family chartered a boat that took us out to Kiana Lodge for the ceremony. The weather wast perfect! We docked back into Seattle around 11:30 and The plan was to return to Oliver's.I think they decided that they had enough of the wedding party as they refused to serve any of the 30-40 people that showed up. They continued to serve other individuals that were not apart of the wedding party. A lot of money was spent at the hotel and selectively the decided not to serve anyone our entire group.Enjoy your stay!!!

<Content>Always Enjoy the MayFlower This nice hotel has that old world charm and is always clean. Great location - you can walk to most of the shops and many great restaurants. The only tricky part is accessing the hotel with Seattle's many one-way streets. Very good value. Have stayed three times and would stay again.

<Content>Terrific European-style hotel with a fabulous location We recently stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel for 2 nights in Seattle. We booked this hotel as part of a package (along with other great hotels in Victoria and Vancouver, BC Canada) via Clipper Vacations. The Mayflower Park has a European Old World feel to it with lots of character you don't normally find at the big national chains. We booked a king-size bedded room via Clipper Vacations and received a fabulous 1-bedroom and living room king corner suite. The room was large. The bathroom had been renovated and was very clean, but also quite small, yet functional. The bar off the lobby seemed to be a very popular place with Seattle locals. The location couldn't be beat -- we walked everywhere from this hotel -- just ten minutes walk from the waterfront and Pike Place Market (have breakfast there at Lowell's). The hotel is located immediately adjacent to Westlake Center shopping mall from where we boarded the monorail to the Space Needle at Seattle Center. And underneath Westlake Center you'll find the impressive (and FREE) downtown transit tunnel where you can take a convenient bus to the Pioneer Square district or anywhere else in Seattle for that matter. Should we return to Seattle, we'd definitely stay again at the Mayflower Park.

<Content>Great location and restaurants I stayed at the Mayflower Park the last weekend in April. For a tourist, it was located in a great location. Quick 4 block walk to Pike Place Market, and the monorail to the Space Needle is connected to the hotel.I had 1/2 price appetizers and sangria in the Andaluca restaurant just off the lobby on Friday afternoon. This is a tiny restaurant and bar, but everything was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I also tried the world famous martinis at Oliver's Bar which is also in the lobby and they were great. It was very quiet on a Sunday night, but a very nice place to relax and enjoy a cocktail.The room I had was tiny. And the bathroom was even smaller. Because it was just me, it was fine, but if there were 2 people it would be claustrophic. I was lucky enough to be given a room on the top floor...it was very quiet. However- waiting on the elevator did require some patience. All in all, it was a quaint little hotel and I would recommend it.

<Content>So Glad We Stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel I know it's been nearly a year since we stayed there, but the visit has stayed with me. We had less than a day to stay in Seattle (we actually only flew there as a cheap gateway from NY to Vancouver Island and Vancouver), but the hotel made Seattle feel more like a destination than a stopover. The hotel was absolutely perfect for us! From the moment we pulled up, the staff was extremely friendly. They made our three kids feel right at home with great goodie bags (thoughtful items in an insulated bag that my daughter still uses as her lunchbag) and great attitudes. The room was very spacious (it was basically a suite but I think was considered a regular room), clean, and there was a great view of the Space Needle. The room felt nicely updated, with two flat screened tv's and pleasant decour. We were a nice walk away from Pike Place Market. I don't remember what we paid for the room, but we got what felt like a very high class boutique hotel for the same price as the lower level, generic hotels in the area. I felt for the duration of my stay like we were getting away with something.We can't wait to go back to the Mayflower Park Hotel and experience Seattle in depth!

<Content>Great Staff Great Location = Great Stay I've stayed here MANY times. It is my first choice for downtown Seattle hotels1 block from Westlake Center and roughly 4 blocks from Pike Place Market this hotel has a great location. But what puts this place above most is the private owners who are good to their staff. Ask an employee how long they have worked there and their answer is usually 15 years or more. That makes for people who care. With low rates for a downtown hotel ($170ish) this place is a winner!

<Content>Excellent stay, great location I chose this hotel based on other Tripadvisor's comments, and I was more than pleased with my stay.The hotel is absolutely charming, along with being clean and well-kept. Front desk staff and doormen were very polite and helpful, and on check-in, the receptionist took the time to show me a map of Seattle along with an explanation of the best places to go and how to get there.Location is unbeatable - walking distance to Pike's market, $2 monorail ride to Space Needle and amusement park, across the street from very large Macy's, and around the corner from Nordstrom's and a pleasant shopping plaza with everything you could want.This hotel is an excellent value, and I'd return here in a heartbeat.

<Content>Flower Power We stayed here as part of a Clipper Vacation package from Victoria. This wasn鈥檛 the 1st time we had stayed at the hotel but was a good reminder of why we came back.The service was helpful without being overbearing, the rooms were well presented with a very comfortable bed (a bed is a bed to me so the fact I commented on this is a surprise) and wonderful shower. We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast and were pleasantly surprised on both counts with the speed, quality and again friendliness of staff.One of the biggest perks of the hotel is the location, you couldn鈥檛 be closer to the shops or the monorail, which takes you out to the sites.We requested a late checkout and were accommodated without fuss, which made our long haul flight a little more manageable.Would I stay again?

<Content>Great hotel, great location Recently spent 5 nights at the Mayflower while attending a conference in Seattle. The location is fantastic as noted by other reviewers. You are walking distance to everywhere. My stay was very nice. My room was quite comfortable. I was very impressed with the quality sheets, pillows, mattress, towels and bathrobes. The only caveats would be the fitness center. I travel alot and rely on hotel fitness centers. This one had only a few pieces of equipment. The other would be the wireless in the room, although complimentary, it was excrutiating slow. This would not stop me from staying here again but I mention in case these are important factors for you.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Perfect Location I chose the Mayflower Park for a quick business trip after my partner had a good experience a few months ago, and could only agree. This fine 1920s building has been handsomely restored, and my 12th floor room was immaculate and well-appointed, if perhaps a bit on the small side. Nice extras included an unusually large walk-in closet with two robes and in-room coffee from the excellent local Torrefazione Italia brand (not the usual in-room commercial brew). The housekeeping staff was unobtrusive, friendly and competent. I don't usually compliment hotels on their valet service, but in this case it proved another distinct plus, especially since parking (normally $25 overnight) had been included in my package rate (check for specials if booking through the hotel website). The valets were extremely quick to bring the car around when I called from my room, alert to pick up the keys whenever I returned to the hotel, and volunteered to give directions. As others have pointed out, the desk is sometimes very friendly and sometimes more or less indifferent, but I found it generally well-run. And it's worth nothing that the Mayflower Park is in an excellent location--within walking distance of all downtown shopping, Pike Place Market, the must-see new public library, and other major attractions; city buses are free of charge downtown and a car isn't urgently needed, and if you're driving to the University or points farther afield the location is also very convenient, notwithstanding Seattle's famously awful traffic. In all, a very handsome and well-run establishment, old-fashioned in a good way and very low-key.

<Content>Not as good as it used to be. Perfect location. Gorgeous looking hotel. Rooms are tiny tiny tiny. Bathroom has no bath just a shower. The service has really slipped here, but it is still an okay place to stay. Do not expect to have doors opened for you and to be treated like you are at the Ritz-Carlton. Also, I disagree with some of the other writers, I could hear my neighbors through the walls. I would recommend staying for one night, but a 4-5 night stay in the claustrophobic room is maddening. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Andaluca, is one of Seattle's finest. The service at the bar Oliver's is not great, but it has wonderful old world ambiance which makes it feel authentic and fun.

<Content>Very nice city hotel The Mayflower was a very pretty historic hotel located in a good area of town that was convenient to the public market, lots of great restaurants, shopping, and nightlife. The staff were very friendly and accomodating and our room was large and well-maintained with a very comfortable bed. My only complaint is that the bathroom was pretty tiny but it really wasn't much of an issue for just two people. The hotel lounge had very good martinis but be sure and stay away from the desserts! Ours was eight dollars for the worst bread pudding by a pastry chef I've ever had. The only down side to the hotel was that it was a little pricey and the valet parking is VERY expensive. However, that will be the situation with any hotel in downtown Seattle. Overall, the hotel was great and we will definitely stay there again when we return.

<Content>Fabulous stay Mayflower Hotel was excellent. The location is absolutely perfect - a nice stroll to the Pike Street Market, with some awesome shopping close by - Macy's, Nordstrom, AF, J. Crew, etc. just a block away. The hotel was clean and comfortable with good beds, and the lounge made a wicked GT! I was particularly impressed with the help we received from the concierge - he came up with a couple of great restaurant suggestions and was very helpful to newcomers to the city.The bathrooms are, indeed, small. Not much room to put a toiletry bag. Our room was on the 10th floor and it was very spacious - two queen beds and lots of room to move around.I'd stay there again without question - the location and comfort of the hotel were exceptional.

<Content>One of the best! This hotel was one of the best I've stayed at. This boutique-style hotel provided impeccable attention to detail. From the front-desk staff, to the valet parking staff, to the concierge services, to the housekeeping staff--everything was top-notch.If you're looking to be in the heart of Seattle, this location can't be beat. The hotel is directly across the street from Macys and is connected to the Westlake Center on the Mezzanine level. We were only four blocks from Pikes Market and were within walking distance to the Space Needle and the big REI store.We booked a Corporate Comforts package, which rolled the parking right into our nightly rate. Our first night was $199, and the subsequent nights at $181 (plus taxes)--so it was an amazing value for the location.We had a corner guestroom, which was actually two separate rooms. The main room had a large sofa, chair, ottoman, table large television/armoire, wet bar with mini-sink, mini-frig, and work desk. Complimentary high-speed internet was provided for our laptop. We needed a roll-away brought in for our daughter for a couple of nights, and there was plenty of space for that in the front room. The roll-way was not your typical folded-up bed, but a thick twin-size mattress on a platform. One large window in each room faced west, plus one additional large window in the main room faced north.There was a glass-paneled door connecting the two rooms. The bedroom had a king-size bed with a heavy comforter and a down-filled blanket. Six Pacific Coast down pillows were on the bed. Also in this room were a wooden valet, large dresser, two nightstands, and a high-definition television. The bathroom was located off the bedroom. Although not overly large, it was well appointed with very nice toiletries. A hair dryer, iron and ironing board were located in the closet, as were two robes.Considering we were in the heart of downtown, we really didn't hear much noise at night--other than an occasional siren. The rooms are very well sound-proofed, and we didn't hear anyone next to us or on the floor above. The nightly turn-down service was a nice surprise. There were individual heating/cooling controls in each of the rooms, which allowed us to adjust each room independently.We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant, so we can't comment on that. There are many dining places closeby, including several Starbucks, many take-out places in the Westlake Center, and a Cheesecake Factory a few blocks away.This hotel would not be particularly attractive for families with young children--especially if you need a pool or game area. It would be a great match for most other travelers if you're looking for a unique hotel with great service. We would absolutely stay at this hotel if we're ever in Seattle again and highly recommend it.

Really nice stores. It it also next to the monorail stop and convenient to the new sculpture park at the waterfront.It is clean and comfortable and a real treat from the chains. Service was good. Parking was about 19-$20/day, I think. The restaurant is well regarded by our local friends although we did not eat there on this trip.Thisd is a nice place downtown that I'd stay in again.

<Content>overall pleased My husband and I stayed for 1 night. We had never been to downtown Seattle before and chose this one from trip advisor.We were pleased. Tiny bathroom but it is one of the first hotels in Seattle and way back when the bathrooms were small. Our room # 704 was very quite did not hear a peep and I am a very light sleeper. Our mattress was lumpy, they need a new one for that room. I thought they were a bit cheap about the water bottles..... Beware! There is a tag on them saying 4.00 but I was so thristy when I came in I just grabbed it and drank then my husband said that will be 4.00 dollars honey! Dinner was very good @ the hotel restaurant and breakfast was fair to good....yucky coffee. I would recommend this hotel as long as your stanards are not 4****. Enjoy!

<Content>Great location, nice hotel! Our family of six stayed at this hotel in two rooms. We had one room with two queen beds and two bathrooms. The room was well-decorated and the beds were comfortable. We had a great view of the Space Needle and the Sound. The other room had two queen beds and a sofa bed. It was an interesting set up--not quite a suite but the living area was separated from the beds by a wall. The hotel is convenient to downtown shopping. It is between Macy's and Nordstrom. It is attached to Westlake Center so you can shop and eat at nice restaurants or even a food court. I like historic hotels and enjoy seeing them well-maintained. The bathrooms weren't gigantic but had everything you would need. This is the part of town that I spend the most time in. It's safe and there's a lot going on. You can take the Monorail from Westlake Center to Seattle Center and it's a short walk to Pike Place Market. Although I am local, my family and I stayed downtown to celebrate the Market's 100th anniversary and were quite pleased with our visit. If I go to a play or want to stay downtown for a Christmas shopping outing I'll choose this hotel again.

<Content>Loved the Mayflower Park Hotel! We stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel in late April 2007. We used to live in the area, so knew the location was prime. The hotel has a great reputation, so we decided to book our stay here and see for ourselves. We were not disappointed!We had a room on the 3rd floor. Our room was quite large, and very comfortable. As we walked in the door, there was a large wet bar with a small refrigerator. Upon entering the main part of the room, there was a sofa and several chairs with ottomans as well as a large coffee table. A very useable seating area, which is not always the case in hotels. We had a king bed, and near the bed area was the large walk in closet (with bathrobes for our use) and the bathroom. The bathroom was a tad small, but not cramped. Everything was nicely appointed and extremely well maintained. Our room looked out to the street towards the old Bon store (now Macy's), so at the holidays it would be a very nice view.Our room was very quiet. We never heard noise from other rooms or from the street. We did not have any meals at the hotel restaurant, but we did have drinks in the bar, Oliver's, several times. This place gets busy, so the wait for drinks can be a bit, but it was never very long.We used the valet several times and they were always very quick. Our visit was so enjoyable that while we were checking out, I booked another stay there for this fall for a girls week in the area. The room was beautiful and the location cannot be beat.

<Content>Rip-off. Outdated, Noisy, Rude Staff, Overpriced Well, the lobby is nice!! That's about all I can say that's positive. Our room was tiny and extremely noisy. We could hear every word in the conversation next door. Our bathroom was outdated, no room for our toiletries or anything else. So was the elevator... very slow and guests had to share the elevator with waiters, cleaning staff and maintenance staff carrying all kinds of equipment, etc., etc. One computer for the whole hotel, and NO privacy when using computer, staff sits right behind you looking at your computer screen!! Hotel is also right next to a park filled with homeless people. What more can I say... we were disappointed to say the least, and I would skip this place at all cost if returning to Seattle.

<Content>Great Location and Service I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. But the place does have its pluses and minuses. Positives-1) Great service- as far as bellhops/valet, and housekeeping go. Getting the car was relatively quick, never a long wait (and supposedly the hotel was fully booked the time we were there) The room was always cleaned on a timely basis. One time we thought we lost our phone (after we had already come up the room) so the valet searched our car for us and even pulled our car up and helped us look for it again.2) Location-Short walk to Pike Place Market and connected to the Westlake Center (monorail/stores/food court)3) The king suite was spacious with a refrigerator and wet bar (convenient to bring back drinks since there is a Walgreens and Rite Aid about 2 blocks away), 2 tv's, and 2 thermostats (one for the bedroom and one for the sofa area)Negatives-1) Noise level-note from the other rooms but from the street below (Our room sat right at the corner of Olive and 4th) I don't know how it is from the higher floors (the hotel is only 12 stories tall) but being on the lower floors you will defintely hear road noise from buses and cars (worse if you open the window). If you are a light sleeper make sure you ask for a high room. The noise didn't bother me but I didn't need an alarm in the morning with all the buses passing by.2)No safe in the room-I though all hotels had one3)Only 2 elevators-Not really a big deal, but they are slow and the staff also use the same elevators so at times you will wait (but again not too bad unless you're impatient) and the elevator are on the small side4)Not stroller friendly-there are 2 entrances into the hotel one of which is a flight of like 10 steps (the main entrance)so you have to use the other entrance on the other side. And the connection to the Westlake Center is on the Mezzanine Level where you also have to go up about 15 stairs. (and again the elevator is small.5)Less chance of getting a good view-Remember there are only 12 floors and I think you have to be on the upper floors if you want to see the water or Space Needle. Compared to the Westin across the street which is super tall and I'm sure you have a better chance of getting a better view (I'm not too much into views so I was okay with looking at the street)Overall I was very pleased with the room and the hotel and wouldn't mind staying here again.

<Content>Luxury I have the luxury of having stayed in a suite here on someone elses dime. The suite had a king size bed, a day bed and a dining table. It's posh, and to tell you the truth this is where I would stay if I was a movie or rock star.No complaints, doesn't get much better than this.

<Content>Nice staff  My boyfriend  I only had one night to stay in Seattle on our vacation to the Pacific NW. At first I was crushed because I had my heart set on the Inn at the Market  they were full. I knew I wanted to stay close to the Pike Street Market  I booked the Mayflower Park unsure of its proximity. It turned out to be perfect- well located in the downtown area, it was just a couple minutes walk from the Fairmont, Triple Door, and the Market. Plus, if you like shopping, Macy's is just across the street. We checked in relatively early (around 10 am) and the kind clerk informed us that he did have *a* room available but it was on a low floor; however, if we didn't mind waiting, he could get us on the 12th floor (highest). IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!! We had a perfect view of the Space Needle from our window! I booked a corner queen room because I read about the necessary extra room (only $7 extra with the AAA discount)- it was big enough for the two of us, esp just for one night. The bathroom wasn't much smaller than any other average hotel bathroom- a little aged, but fully functional. I liked the overall character of this historic hotel. Comfortable elegance :)

<Content>Best Value in Seattle This is a centrally located hotel that is a very good value. I have stayed in a number of hotels downtown and this is my favorite for the price The rooms were clean and in good condition and the staff was very courteous. Unless, you want to pay more for a room closer to the water for the views this is the best place to stay downtown.

<Content>Loved the two bathrooms! My sister and I spent one night in Seattle a few weeks ago at the Mayflower Park Hotel after an Alaskan cruise. I do a LOT of research before I book a hotel and I found that the Mayflower had some rooms with two queen beds and two baths. It could not have been more perfect for two women traveling together! Although they couldn't guarantee us that type of room, they did honor our request. We were across the street from Nordstoms and all the downtown shopping and just a few blocks from the Pike Place Market. I don't think we could have been in a better location. I thought the lobby was much nicer than in the hotel's pictures on the web sites and the bar off the lobby was beautiful, on the corner of the street with lots of paned windows and atmosphere. Great spot for a nightcap. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable, nice linens and toiletries; all in all we had a great experience. I had read that there was a lot of construction downtown, but we really didn't notice any. One last thing, there are buses on 1st street that are free and we caught a bus down to the old area of Seattle called Pioneer Square and took an underground tour in the afternoon. It was only a couple of hours but very interesting to learn about Seattle's history.

<Content>Happily Surprised! This place was great! We thought because of the price, smaller size and age of the hotel we would have a slightly out of date historic hotel waiting for us - HOWEVER, when we walked in we where thrilled to find a beautifully updated hotel. The location is perfect for Pikes Market and other downtown shopping and dinning within walking distance. Our room was just right and very up to date and the bathroom spotless. The staff were extremely nice. From the doormen, valet, desk clerk to the concierge. Everyone was helpful and professional. The concierge reccommened excellent restaurants within walking distance and within minutes we had resservations and the local movie theater times printed and in our hands. We were impressed and will not only return to the Mayflower but will recommend it to friends. Lloved this hotel, staff, location and price. You won't be disappointed!

<Content>Good location, lovely suite Booked a room for one night. We chose the Mayflower because it offers two QUEEN beds and I was traveling with my two sisters. The hotel upgraded us to a suite so one sister slept on the sofa bed. Unexpected, very nice. Great service, and beautiful room. Nice bath products, too! Room was very quiet. I'd certainly stay here again and recommend to others.

<Content>Mayflower has some "thorns" Stayed at the Mayflower for a 2 day business meeting on June 5 and 6th. Advice to meeting planners: Think twice of having a meeting if over 70 participants will be at your function. The hotel was overwhelmed. Initially, the Plymouth Room, their largest conference room, which is under the lobby is attractive, but can only handle 8-9 tables of 8-10 people. Secondly, the mens room is up the stairs, across the lobby and down the stairs on the other side-- only the women's restaurant is adjacent to the meeting room. Finally, getting everyone's luggage out after the meeting was too much for 2 people. Chaos ensued for those running to catch a plane.As far rooms go, I was told I had an upgrade (Room 321). Apparently, I had a little more bathroom space. Unfortunately, the upgrade ended there, since I had a view of the hotel airconditioning unit, light well and having the hotel's mechanical power supply and hydraulic units kick on every few minutes did not allow a great night sleep. If you are given a room that looks into the lightwell, turn around and ask for a room that fronts the streets. You will be Sleepless in Seattle and highly disappointed if you dont.While most reviews, sound good for the most part, I want TripAdvisor members to be aware of some of the issues of this 80 year old hotel. Finally, make sure you allow for 15-20 minutes for valet. Your car could be blocks away. Oh, by the way, they charge $28.00 a day.

<Content>Nice Hotel We were a group of six staying for two nights before our Alaskan cruise. Our room was spacious but the bathroom was tiny (typical for older hotels). The staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful but we were misinformed by the conceirge and bellman on more than one occassion. Our room was quiet but another couple traveling with us said their room was extremely noisy from the street traffic. We were on the same floor but around the corner from them.I didn't find the bed to be very comfortable as I've read in previous reviews. But I may be bias as I have a tempurpedic bed at home so it is difficult for me to find comfortable beds when traveling.The monorail station in the mall attached to the hotel is convenient but beware that it only travels to the space needle and back, there are no other stops.The restaurant attached to the hotel has great breakfast with excellent service.Seattle is a great city and I would love to travel there again. I might check out a different hotel just to have variety but I'd recommend this hotel to friends or family.

<Content>Great Historic Hotel We were in town for a family wedding on Memorial Weekend. We had a wonderful time at this hotel. Two women traveling together could not ask for a better room. Our room had two beds and two bathrooms. The beds are so comfortable you could get spoiled. Great view from our 8th floor room. The room is not that large but for the amount of time we spent in the room it was perfect for us. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go downtown. Bring your walking shoes.We visited the space needle, pike's market, numerous restaurants, and did lots of shopping.Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.Even if you don't have dinner in the hotel restaurant I would recommend dessert. We would stay here again.

<Content>A wonderful hotel in a great location! If you are planning a weekend trip to Seattle, Mayflower Hotel is the place to stay. The location of this historic hotel can't be better. You will be within 5 to 10 walking minutes to everything you should see in Seattle. Places like, Seattle's famous Fresh Market with the most amazing fresh seafood, produce, beautiful flowers and fantastic restaurants; the Underground, Space Needle, Seattle's Waterfront views and you won't even need to exit to the street to take a ride on a Monorail because it is connected with the hotel building. Also this hotel has a complimentary valet parking which is a huge plus considering that all other hotels in the Downtown area charge $25-$30 per night. The rooms are clean and comfortable, a very nice staff. The hotel has a restaurant and a martini bar on the first floor for those who would like to relax after a long day of sightseeing. During your stay in Seattle I would recommend to take one of the Argosy Lock Cruises- it鈥檚 really fun and memorable. Here is the link to their website so you can book your tickets in advance. www.argosycruises.com If this is your first time in Seattle, you are going to fall in love with this city! Enjoy it and have a safe trip.

We paid extra for a deluxe room which was extremely comfortable, quite large and had a view of the Space Needle.Reception staff and the valet were friendly and professional.The loaction is excellent. We only had one day there to explore but managed to fit in Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, some shopping in Macy's and because it's right next door to the monorail, we managed to squeeze in a trip up to the Seattle Centre with a vist to the Space Needle.This would be our first choice when visiting Seattle again.

<Content>Beautiful Little Hotel Stayed four nights at Mayflower Park as part of a girls weekend. Can was a quick ride and $38 from airport. We boooked this hotel because it was near everything we were interested in.Check in-I'd called ahead and told the front desk I was a light sleeper and would like a quiet room. I had a nice conversation with the girl and she said no problem, but when I arrived at my room, it was right next to the elevator. I went straight back and explained the problem. First I was told there were no other rooms, so I asked if I could pay extra for an upgraded room and I was told there were none. Finally I was given a quieter room, but with a view of a ugly brick wall. I made my request when I booked four months prior and called to confirm two days ahead so this shouldn't have been an issue.Room-Very small but perfect for just me. I did find myself feeling abit closed in. The bath towels could have been nicer. The bed was fine. I slept great every night but better linens are always a plus-maybe Mayflower Park should invest in some. The walls were also very thin. The housekeeping staff was wonderful. Had drinks and Bar snacks downstairs-wonderful and room service breakfast one day-wonderful and quick. I gave this above average because I would stay again and I enjoyed the experience of a smaller hotel and not a big chain. I also was really close to everything I wanted. We walked constantly, Pike's Market, Pioneer Square (Teri Lyn at Bill Speidels Underground tour was the best), Capitol Hill, all the shops and restaurants in the CBD, ferries, etc. I think this hotel is great for single travelers that enjoy something a little more elegant but keep in mind it is an old people with very thin walls.

<Content>A very nice stay Mayflower Park Hotel is a great choice if you want something equidistant between the Space Needle and the basball/football arenas, as I did. The needle is definitely walkable.The stadiums are too, but are much longer.Definitely leave 30-40 minutes for that walk.Another thing that's very close is Pike Place Market. It's only a few blocks away.Also, you're right next to all major shopping, tins of restaurants, Starbucks of course, and plenty of fast-food joints.The staff was extremely friendly and I would easily stay there again. The rooms are pleasant. I had a classic room, and it was a touch small, but it's fine fine for one or two people.

<Content>Elegant hotel, friendly staff and close to everything We stayed at the Mayflower Park hotel before departing on an Alaskan cruise and couldn't have been more pleased. We felt absolutely spoiled here--we had a lovely and spacious corner room with a view of the space needle (didn't even request it--lucky us!). This historic hotel's renovations were incredible. The bed linens were top quality, carpets were imaculate, wet bar area was a wonderful surprise and there must have been 4 sets of windows in the room at least. The marble bath was fantastic, as were the toiletries and the lighting. The staff was very helpful from the moment we stepped on the sidewalk until they loaded our bags in the cab the next day. Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer. We discovered in our room directory, a welcome pass to Macys with a percent off coupon, for being visitors to Seattle. We arrived from a very long flight and were exhausted but with limited time in Seattle we forced ourselves to get out of our comfy room to see the sights of Seattle. We were maybe 4 blocks from Pike Place Market, just around the corner from a mall, several restaurants, across the street from Macy's and maybe 6-10 blocks from the Space Needle. There is only one or two small elevators, but in a historic hotel, I had no problem--we maybe waited 2-3 minutes for a ride. We must have passed 3 Starbucks just on the short walk to Gordon Biersch brew pub (wonderful views of Seattle, great food and muted lighting were perfect after a long day of travel). We slept like rocks on our comfier-than-home bed and awoke very early the next morning (still being on eastern time) and luckily that worked in our favor. We grabbed a cuppa joe at (of course) Starbucks and walked down to Pike Place and watched the flower markets and food markets open and get ready for the day. We walked behind the marketplace to see the sound in the morning and then tucked back in to Pike to one of the best diners, The Atheneum. We ate a hearty breakfast for about $6 each with coffee/juice. The inside felt like a classic seaside diner with a counter and several (full) booths. Great views of the sound from the windows and very friendly staff. Just let us take our time to relax and enjoy the view and food--no rushing. We walked through a few shops and headed back to the room a few hours later to check out. As we were checking out the doorman arranged a cab, and hauled our bags for us. Cannot say enough nice things about Seattle or this hotel. A great city, clean, friendly laid back people and great weather. One thing we didn't take advantage of was the hotel restaurant or room service. The food smelled fantastic though.

<Content>Great Location and Reasonable Rates We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights over the Easter Long Weekend. We loved the location (right in the middle of shopping, restaurants and very close to Pike Place Market) and were impressed with the friendly car valet and very courteous and helpful front desk staff.Rooms and bathrooms were not large but fit our needs just fine. I had looked at other nearby hotels and found the rates at the Mayflower to be very reasonable for the area. We had a great time walking around Seattle and enjoyed eating at nearby restaurants expecially at Etta's Seafood  Assiago's. We also liked Bill Sepidel's Underground Tour in Pioneer Square. When we checked out, we were asked if we wanted to leave our bags for a while. There was no fee for this and I thought that this was very thoughtful. It was nice to leave our car in the valet parking and our bags in the hotel while we took the underground tour and did some shopping before heading home.

<Content>Historic downtown hotel with a good location Wanting to take our 2 teenage kids to see another city, Seattle was next on our list. I decided to book 2 deluxe rooms at the Mayflower Park hotel based on its location and positive reviews here on Tripadvisor. We prefer to stay at hotels that have a local feel, rather than a corporate hotel. This hotel fit that bill. Our rooms were nicely furnished. My husband and I had a corner room (I specifically requested because the deluxe ones are slightly larger). On the 10th floor we had a fun view of the Macy's marquee out one window and the Seattle Space Needle out the other. Our kids shared a double queen that had 2 seperate bathrooms! and an amazing picture view ot the Needle.Having 2 bathrooms for the kids was a very pleasant surprise, because the bathrooms are not large. One of my few complaints about this hotel is the lack of vanity space and the very low water pressure (at least on the 10th floor.) I am not sure exactly how many rooms have this double bathroom feature, but I would ask about it if I were booking here again.The hoitel is located right next to the Monorail to visit EMP and the Space Needle. We all enjoyed EMP. Views from the top of the Needle were gorgeous and we were able to see all the way to Canada and all of the surrounding snow covered mountains.The Mayflower Park is very well located to ALL of the major shopping and just a few blocks from Pikes Place Market and lots of great places to have dinner. We really enjoyed Etta's Seafood.It had a great Seattle vibe, and something for everyone.Our best breakfast was sharing a bag of just fried dounut holes from a vendor at Pikes Place Market and coffee.As I said before, I had few complaints. I do see room for improvement in two areas: better beds (they move ALOT when ever your partner moves) and larger bath towels would be nice. My husband and I had cocktails down at Oliver's in the lobby. Nice bar. We did have a forgettable breakfast at the hotel and did not return to eat any other meals there. Having access to free wireless in our room was nice, too.All considered it is a good, centrally located historic hotel.

<Content>Charming classic hotel in good location We spent four nights at the Mayflower in February 2007. We understand that the hotel was close to being torn down when it was rescued and completely renovated by a local group. It is now an independently-owned hotel in the style of upscale classic city hotels, entirely non-smoking and in the heart of downtown Seattle within several blocks of Pike鈥檚 Market. For those who shop, it is convenient to major chain stores (Macy鈥檚, Nordstrom etc), and opens directly from the lobby into Westlake Center (an indoor multi-story shopping mall). Room costs vary and one can find bargain rates via the internet as we did.Our room had two queen beds, a large desk with drawers for clothing, an armoire with TV above and more drawers below, a coffee maker (with regular and decaf coffee and tea provided). There was no mini-fridge 鈥?though we did not ask to see if one might be provided on request. The bathroom had a tub/shower and single sink, with 3 sets of thick towels (for two people). The d茅cor was tasteful and attractive 鈥?dark wood Chippendale-style furniture in excellent condition, tasteful carpeting and drapes. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I communicated with one concierge by email and phone and she responded quickly and fully to my questions about transportation from the airport. The concierge on duty during our stay responded to our queries with enthusiasm 鈥?calling a place we asked about visiting to make sure they would be open, making dinner reservations on our behalf, recommending another excellent restaurant and suggesting a theatre performance that we thoroughly enjoyed.Transportation from the airport is available by taxi, shuttle, and Grayline hotel bus. The latter is by far the least expensive for one person traveling alone (less than half of the shuttle cost, and about a third of the taxi fare) but stops at the Westin Hotel which is a short 1.5 blocks from the Mayflower Park. The short walk is slightly uphill and is very easy with a small roll-on suitcase. The hotel has its own parking garage on site.The hotel has an attractive bar and a restaurant, but no souvenir or other shop. For toiletries and the like, there is a drugstore a half block away from the Mayflower Park. For other items, there is the small but well-stocked gourmet Ralph鈥檚 Grocery  Deli about two blocks away from the hotel on 4th Avenue. Ralph鈥檚 has a good selection of local Washington state and other wines, cold beer, and makes sandwiches to order as well as selling other grocery items. The owner (Joe Cohen) is very knowledgeable and most helpful with choices of Washington state wine and port as well as other products in his store.

<Content>Location, Location, Location!! This hotel is like being in Mecca if you're idea of Nirvana is shopping. It is very easy to locate in Seattle. The car valets were helpful and courteous. The front desk staff were prompt. And the concierge, well, he was the absolute best we have ever had. He had suggestions for shows, attractions, timelines, and restaurants. He even made suggestions for what to order off the menus!The room we had was a standard with a small queen. It was a corner room with 2 windows that opened to let in fresh air (yes, you need fresh air even in frigid February). It was a little stuffy without the windows being left open. I would say spend a little extra money and get a deluxe room with a king. The bathroom was also very small and not big enough for 2 people sharing! Definitely need either 2 bathrooms (as some of the more deluxe rooms have), or ask for one with a larger bathroom.However, we didn't spend hardly any time in the hotel as we were out and about so much.The location was ideal. One block from either direction of both Macy's and Nordstrom's (and about 6 Starbuck's coffee bars in a 4 block radius). Plus, just 5 minute walks from other name-brand chains. And close to Pike Place market and great venues like the Triple Door, and fantastic restaurants. Too many restaurants to choose from. All that means is that we will need to go back and try them all out. And we will definitely be staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel; plan to make it 'our hotel' whenever we go to Seattle.

<Content>A Gem in the Emerald City As a special treat for my wifes birthday, I booked an overnight at the Mayflower Park. I had not seen anything about this hotel prior to visiting the 5th Ave Theatres website, which directed me to this hotel as part of their family of hotels in the area. I had already made reservations at the Fairmont Olympic, but decided to try the Mayflower Park. ( I was taken by the price difference of about 250 dollars/night)From the moment we booked the room, to the time we left, we found the Mayflower Park to be an exceptional boutique hotel. I was first impressed by the lobby decor and lighting, and a front desk staff that was polite, welcoming and very efficient. we had a corner room which was smaller than an average room, but very very clean and delightful. It reminded us of some very good hotels we stayed in Paris, but half the cost.Dinner at Andalucas was remarkable. The ambiance, impeccable service, friendliness and price were all well within the range of excellent. I had the quail, which I must add, was fantastic.After seeing White Christmas at the 5th Ave Theatre (beautiful show and theatre) we walked back to the Mayflower Park to be once again welcomed by the front desk staff who inquired about our evening at the show. The fact they take an interest in what we do while staying in the neighborhood makes me feel like a valued customer. Bed was very comfortable. bathroom, clean as any can be. Overall room appeal was great, and with a corner room you may find a bit more street noise, but I still say it is worth it.I can highly recomend this hotel for anyone. I do not however recomend it if you have children, as some guests, and the closeness of the rooms might make your children feel out of place and unwanted. Happy Travels!

<Content>As a local, I have a totally different perception I have been reading all the reviews of the hotels that have been ranked above the Mayflower, and I find it very interesting. I live within 10 miles of the Mayflower, but every year our dinner club books a night here during the Christmas holidays so that we can eat downtown, experience the city, and not have to drive after we have had many cocktails. This year was no exception. The hotels that were mentioned with a higher rating than the Mayflower are great hotels. However, the Mayflower is far and above the others. This hotel has a much better central location, the rooms are large and very well appointed, the staff is great and courteous AND for the location and room - the price can't be beat. The hotels in the University District and on Lake Union are great - BUT they are a cab ride away from downtown Seattle. The Mayflower is right in the middle of Seattle - within walking distance of the waterfront, Pike Place Market, Nordstrom, Macy's - all the best restaurants. Plus, it is so reasonable. If this is where the locals choose to stay - we can't be that wrong. We love this hotel. The staff is wonderful and the Anduluca Restaurant is superb. Oliver's Martini Bar gets crowded - so arrive early! You will truly experience what Seattle is at this hotel.

<Content>A European Styled Hotel in Downtown Seattle If you want a hotel with a big Lobby packed with guests lounging around waiting for their Convention buddies so they can go to a noisy hotel bar, then the Mayflower is not the place you will want to stay.The Mayflower is one of those small historic hotels that if you were in London you would be writing home about. Cozy, charming and right downtown near all the stores including Nordstroms across the street. Yes, the bathrooms are on the small side but done in a very nice black  white tile. Oliver's is the bar in the hotel and they are know for their martinis and the hotel breakfast at Andaluca is very good.If you are bringing your car, let me suggest you valet park it and then walk around downtown or take a cab, as it less expensive to do that than pay $12 for a 2-hour parking lot near Pike Place Market or a similar amount down near the waterfront. By the way, you won't be fighting a tour bus when you arrive, as it is a hotel made for people not conventioneers running up and down the hallway at 2am.Not cheap...but I have found not much is among the better hotels in Seattle these days.

<Content>Noise issues for some rooms Very nice hotel, room was a bit small but nicely appointed. Staff was VERY friendly and helpful. One problem which I considered unacceptable was our room was located on the 6th floor, backside of the building, which was right across the alley from the HVAC system of the building next door. It was very loud and made for a terrible night's sleep. The hotel was fully booked, so no relief was available.If you choose this hotel, make sure you request a room facing 4th or Olive Sts. The traffic noise is to be expected in a downtown hotel, but not the alternative.Other than that, great place.

<Content>Underwhelming but not a bad choice My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Mayflower Park in July 2006. I chose it for the very central location -- walking distance to the Pikes Market, Space Needle, ferry terminal, monorail, etc.; the price-point -- about $215/night plus tax; and the good reviews here and elsewhere. The biggest problem was that our room's air conditioning was not working. It was close to 80 degrees in the room. An engineer came up twice, but the problem was never fixed. Ultimately, the engineer admitted to us our room had a problem as did another room on our floor. We had to ask to be moved to another room -- no offer was made. The substitute room looked out at a brick wall. It appeared to be a single -- full bed, not queen; one nightstand; no table by the reading chair as in our first room. The room rate was adjusted down, but it was a lesser room, so it just ended up feeling like the hotel didn't care more than the minimum necessary. On Sunday, our room was not made up until 4:30 in the afternoon, after we had been out all day and returned hoping to relax for a while. When our bill was prepared, we were incorrectly double-charged. The hotel provides one computer for free internet access, but it is not easily found and no one told us about it. Not awful problems, just annoying. The Mayflower is a place with lots of brass trim, big flower arrangements in the lobby, and you have to call room service if you want ice. If that's your style, and if the air conditioning in your room is working, I think you'll find the Mayflower to be a fair choice. If you're like me, and favor modern accommodations, no opulent frllls, consistent quality, and a feeling you are a valued customer. . . you may end up deciding the Mayflower Park is a bit underwhelming.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great This is a lovely hotel, within walking distance to the shops (a chemist/convenience store is located about 2 minutes walk), Pike Place market, Space Needle etc. We were upgraded to a twin Queen suite which was really nice though the bathroom was a little small considering the room was so big. We were on the 6th floor on the corner of 4th  Olive and had no problem with the noise from the roads. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. A lovely place to stay and would recommend it.

<Content>Great Location! My husband and I spent a week in the hotel and loved the location. It was close to shopping, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, etc. The room was a little small even though we upgraded to a bigger corner unit, but no complaints other than that. The service was fantastic and would definitely stay at the Mayflower again!

<Content>Classy and friendly hotel Seattle is a friendly city anyway but the Mayflower Park made it even more so. The staff were always ready with a friendly word, even if they didn't have to bother - and it really made our trip. We had a superb room, quite high up with a view (of the Space Needle) as requested. The room was beautifully clean and very well maintained, comfortable and relaxing. Situated Downtown, the hotel is in an excellent position for all the main attractions and an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of shopping and business. Expensive yes, but a great start to our two weeks holiday. A very classy and stylish hotel.

<Content>Good Location, too much $$$ for room My husband and I just got back from spending one evening at the Mayflower. It is a very beautifully decorated hotel. We arrived early and they held our bags for us and called us when our room was ready. When we went in the room our first reaction was good....we got the deluxe room/with parking, which is a queen sized bed (although it looked like a double) and a little sitting area. The down sides started at about 10:00 at night since our room was located right by a stockroom so basically until 12:00am/1:00am there was a very loud noise outside our bedroom of whatever or whomever was working out in the hallway. As well, we were on the 8th floor and we could still hear all the noises out on the street?? Insulation not so great? You could also hear doors slamming and water running.Upon investigating a bit found bathroom was very small....my husband at 6'1 had to crouch down to take a shower since the showerhead was quite low. The check in/out agents were not the friendliest, but were friendly enough. I think that with the amount of $$$ this hotel charges it is more for the location than the service or quality of room.The reasoning for my review is that we actually stayed at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Everett the night before at 1/3 of the price (it is only 1/2 hour from downtown Seattle) and the service was 100% better, as well as our room was bigger (king size bed) and the bathroom was double the size. So if you want to stay specifically in downtown Seattle then I agree the Mayflower is definitely a good location, but if you don't mind staying out a bit, try the Holiday Inn Downtown Everett!! Well worth it!

<Content>Great first trip to Seattle I am a little late posting had a great experience and had to share. I had my first business trip to Seattle and stayed at the Mayflower. What a great hotel! Arrived a little early and room was not ready but they held my luggage and recommended a great burger joint down the road. Once I got in my room I was so happy I picked this hotel. The room was so cute! A little small but nice. The bathroom had Aveda products which I thought was a nice touch. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Even the pilgrims would be proud of this Mayflower I treated my wife to a night at the Mayflower Park for her birthday. They offer a great theater package that includes two tickets to the Fifth Avenue Theater (about three blocks away), valet parking and a room for the night. They also offer shopper and romance packages. First, you can't beat the Mayflower Park's location: it's in the center of downtown Seattle, adjacent to Westlake Mall shopping center and all of major department stores. The Mayflower Park is a great, 1927 vintage hotel that has been renovated without losing its deco character. The staff are attentive and friendly. We received a call within 5 minutes of going to our room to see if everything was okay.Our room was tiny by modern standards, but it was decorated so well that you almost didn't notice. Since the room was small, so was the bed. But it was comfortable. We also had a great view of the city and the holiday lights. The bathroom retains much of the original tile and has been renovated with high quality fixtures. All rooms include robes, irons, and coffee makers. The rooms seem well insulated as we didn't hear any noise from the hall or the street.The hotel has a great martini bar Olivers, and an upscale restaurant, Andaluca. We had a wonderful, romantic dinner before going to the theater. The food was top notch as was the service and ambiance.The only downside to the Mayflower Park was the lack of on site workout facilities and the elevators. There are only two elevators and they are small and extremely slow. But other than that, I highly recommend the Mayflower Park for a weekend getaway or a base camp for exploring Seattle.

<Content>Fantastic Friday at the Mayflower Park Stayed here on the recommendation of many co-workers, many native Seattle-ites. It was just lovely. It's always a treat to stay in a hotel that is part of the Historic Hotels of America and this one was a gem. Great front-desk staff who really made an effort to take their time with each person. The room, though smaller than modern hotel rooms, was tasteful and comfortable, and best of all--quiet! Our corner room gave us a view of the Space Needle and Queen Anne. And the bathroom was terrific--especially that old-fashioned bathtub that was deep enough for a good soak on a cold, wet evening. Oliver's, just off the lobby, makes an exquisite martini, too.

<Content>nice hotel, small problems which were addressed We stayed at the Mayflower park for 2 nights in October 2005 as return visitors. As others have said, the staff is really the best! Derek the Concierge is extremely helpful. He made arrangements for a shuttle service to pick us up and take us to QWest Field (only $5.00 per person round trip) for the football game which was the main purpose for our visit to Seattle this time and gave us the names of plenty of restaurants from which to choose. Robert at the front desk couldn't have been nicer. We had some noise issues due to the location of our room (the headboards of our beds shared a common wall with the housekeeping supply room) so there was no sleeping past 8:00am, the time housekeeping starts working. When we spoke to Robert about this and a couple other small problems (the spigot of the bathtub fell out of the wall on my husband's foot and the air conditioning wasn't working too well), he immediately offered to refund half of the cost of our first night's stay. Not what we were looking for but very, very much appreciated! Also as others have said, the bathroom in our room was extremely small but they do the best with the space they have. The location of the hotel is very convenient to many of the great sights, shopping and restaurants of downtown Seattle. We'll be back.

<Content>Nice hotel, good location, friendly service We spent a night at the Mayflower Park in August. The service was great and everyone was very attentive and very accommodating. We requested a room upgrade, but the hotel was full. However, the front desk clerk gave us coupons for free drinks and appetizers in the lounge. The lounge was great and so were the free drinks and appetizers. The room was really small and the bathroom was tiny, but this is an older hotel. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but it looked really good for this range hotel - lots of newer equipment, tvs and magazines to make it less tedious, and the air conditioning worked. We'd definitely consider staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Mayflower Park Hotel-Great Location, Great Hotel We enjoyed a two night stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel in August, 2005. While it was a busy time in Seattle (The Ring Cycle was at the opera that week) we were upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise. We had a wet bar with coffeemaker, mini-refigerator and sink, large living area with desk (free wireless internet access too, very nice), sofa and comfy chairs, king bed, large closet/dressing room, and nice bathroom though small, but with historic fittings. The Hotel is a member of the Historic Hotels of America, and the lobby is small but evokes a historic feeling. Another nice bonus was the invitation to the Wednesday early evening wine tasting and hors d'oeuvres in the restaurant, Andalucia. Very pleasant experience. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but the hotel's location right in the center of town provided us lots of exercise walking up and down Seattle's hills. We walked to REI, the Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and even the Victory Brewery from the hotel. The front desk and bell staff were particularly helpful, and the host at the wine tasting was very pleasant. We would certainly recommend the Mayflower Park Hotel and will definitely stay there again-there was so much to see and do in Seattle, we barely scratched the surface!

We saw all of Seattle's best sites and never needed a car. The monorail station is in the adjoining mall. Could walk to Pike Place, flagship Nordstrom (yay), even to Safeco Field to see the Mariners. The staff was gracious and helpful, always willing to offer directions, suggestions or to secure a cab when needed. The rooms weren't huge, but more than adequate - light and very clean. Would definitly come back.

<Content>What a fabulous hotel experience!! This is my second visit to this hotel.It was as lovely as I remembered it. The amenties, decor and ambiance that this hotel portrays makes you feel luxurious! The history of the hotel alone, makes you feel as if you have stepped back into the early days of Seattle. The entire staff was very helpful, pleasant and warm. It is so nice to come to a hotel and feel like you are truly being taken care of. I think the location is perfect; close to downtown shopping, people watching, and a short hike to Pike's Place Market. I recommend this hotel to anyone I know who is going to the Seattle area. I travel throughout the US with my job so staying in hotels is a given. This was a treat! I commend everyone at the Mayflower and I look forward to my next visit there!

The room (deluxe) was large and beautiful with a couch and two upholstered chairs, desk and nice furnishings. The bathroom was small but not too small. Nice linens and towels. We didn't have a car and thought the location was ideal for shopping, Pike's market, Seattle Center and even walked all the way back from the baseball game through Pioneer Square, etc (about 30 minutes). The staff were all very friendly and helpful and Andaluca's, the restaurant, was excellent (had breakfast and dinner). We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Very Satisfied We stayed two nights in a deluxe room (7th floor at the corner of Olive and 4th). The rate was competitive with other downtown hotels that were highly rated on this site, and I was unable to find a better rate on Hotwire for a hotel of the same class. The room was large with an excellent bed and a comfortable sitting area, adequate closet and drawer space, nicely decorated and appointed. The bathroom was small (no vanity) and I had some difficulty maintaining constant water temperature in the shower. There was some noise from the hallway but muffled, not loud enough to disturb the peace except doors slamming in the morning. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful (parking valets who offered to take care of luggage if we wanted, front desk staff, and especially concierge). The location is excellent, especially close to shopping, a few blocks walk to Pike Place Market and the waterfront, about a 15-20 minute walk to Pioneer Square. Were I to return to Seattle, I would return to the Mayflower Park unless an equivalent hotel offered a substantially better price.

<Content>The Mayflower Park Hotel is Outstanding! Subject: Mayfair Park HotelLocation: SeattleTitle: Mayfair Park Hotel is OutstandingID#: 3547496 The Mayfair Park Hotel completely surpassed our expectations. When we made our reservations we explained that we had never visited Seattle, that my husband is in ill health with mobility restrictions. We requested a Deluxe room, with a sitting area, which at that time was not available. Imagine our pleasant surprise when we arrived on June 1 to find we had been upgraded to a beautiful corner suite with separate bedroom. The hotel is elegant with the best trained, pleasant staff we've ever encountered. The hotel is perfectly situated right next to the Westlake Mall and the monorail to the Space Needle. We had planned to stay 3 days but my husband's health problems made it necessary to cancel the last night. The hotel was gracious and understanding, allowing us late check out. We would recommend the Mayfair Park Hotel to anyone looking for a truly magnificent experience in Seattle. A TripAdvisor MemberFt. Myers, FL

<Content>Great downtown location Fantastic location - right in the centre of the shopping part of downtown, with acess directly into the Westlake shopping centre and great transport links.Room was not huge but adequately sized and clean. Doors on hotel rooms were on sprung hinges and tended to slam a bit, and walls were on the thin side, but these were minor issues. Staff were helpful and friendly - restaurant was pricey but the food did smell pretty good.Good food nearby at Changs (in Westlake) and microbrew pubs in both Rainier Square and Pacific Place. Would gladly stay here again.

<Content>Quaint and Convenient Mayflower Park I have been living in this cute, little hotel once a month for about 3 years now (3-12 day stays over the last three years), so this might be somewhat biased. I reside here for business reasons, so the free WiFi is much appreciated. The rooms are small as American hotels go, so if you like larger rooms, go elsewhere. Even the suites (I've stayed in almost all the rooms at this point) are small. However, the warmth of the staff over the years (with little turn-over, actually) and the coziness of both the connected bar, Oliver's (one of the best Martini bars in Seattle- a MUST!!! even if you don't stay here) and Andaluca restaurant, which is pricey but tastey (free wine tastings on Wednesdays) are sometimes worth the small rooms. The hotel is conveniently located near several restaurants and many stores: Macy's (they give you discounts for this former Bon Marche at the hotel), Nordstroms, Abercrombie, Sophora, etc. The hotel is connected to Westlake Mall (another convenience), and the monorail is on the top floor that can take you to the Space Needle, park, and Experience Music. The Simpson's did a take-off on this one minute monorail, another part of Seattle life. Each room is carpeted with an armoir that contains a t.v. and drawers for whatever, no mini-bar. The beds are quite comfortable, and a.c. or heat are generally in good working order. If you're uncomfortable, go down to the desk and let them know- they will re-accomodate you. The restrooms are nice, but have limited space just above the sink on a glass railing to place personal items. Aveda products (shampoo, conditioner, soap, and body lotion) are provided as complimentary items. Showers are somewhat narrow, so it help to put the rubber mat on the floor. All closets are a very nice size with thin, cloth robes provided. Of course, very Seattle-esque, there is a Tully's on one corner and Starbucks just behind the hotel. I have read many of the reviews thus far, and I agree with all of them; however, one must remember that Seattle is the Emerald City, and people operate on a completely different level than in other parts of the country; it's part of the charm (and sometimes healthy tension). Having lived in New York, L.A., Dallas, and Houston, it was culture shock at first, but then it became delightlful and the source of good laughter. I got a good laugh from the review before mine about the guy not knowing how to make coffee- that's so Seattle. Yes, phone servce in the hotel is not the best, but Seattle people like face to face, and the responsibilities of that SMALL front desk with that many rooms and people wearing two hats is difficult.... Just relax. The lobby is GORGEOUS! A huge chandelier hanging in the front with fresh slowers put in often. The 2nd lobby floor (that connects to Westlake) contains a player piano and great sitting area fo meetings. Meeting rooms are great at his hotel, which is often the host to social events, from weddings to other celebrations.My only complaint is about the elevators: they are certainly large enough, but since the wait staff, maids, etc. use them, they often take a LONG LONG time to get to the lobby. Just go the bar, get a Martini, then catch it when you can. Make sure to visit restaurants along the Sound. The concierge (Derrick these days) is excellent, and they can get you deals that sometimes you can't- every conciege at this hotel has been both brilliant and enthusiastically helpful.

<Content>Terrible service I flew to Seattle from Reno to see Audioslave perform and stayed at The Mayflower Park Hotel for 5 nights.My first problem was with room service. They almost never pick up the phone and I always ended up calling the front desk to place my orders. I tried ordering coffee once, at 3 pm Friday and was told I have to wait until 4pm because the person there didn't know how to make coffee. That was a pretty strong statement, so I decided to go to the bar and have a drink and see how service is in there. Big mistake! Not only were the employees rude, but the Bloody Mary I ordered was filled to the rim with ice, which I hate. I asked for a glass to get rid of some of the ice and the bartender actually got mad at me!The alltime worst incident came when I gave a maid $20 to clean my room, which I think is a lot of money for 10 minutes work and she told management I smoked in a non-smoking room, which resulted in a $120 fine, because she'd seen my cigarettes on the table.Fortunately Audioslave was incredible and my trip was far from ruined but The Mayflower Park Hotel just isn't a good value.

<Content>Wonderful Experience Stayed at the Mayflower Park in Feb 2005 for a few days and had a wonderful experience. We were able to obtain the Entertainment rate which was 50% off the rack rate. Room was very large and we had a view of the Space Needle. Front desk staff was very helpful with last minute dinner recommendations. Did not eat at the hotel because it was on the expensive side and there were so many places to eat within walking distance. Monorail entrance is located next to the hotel and the underground bus stop is down the block. Definitely would stay at this hotel again.

Helpful staff. Nice bedding.But, no doorman, no bell boy, two small elevators that fill quickly, and turndown service at an earlybird hour of 6pm.Because we were using gift certificates, the hotel would only give us a room at full rack rate ($125 more than what we could've gotten at the hotel's own website)-definitely not worth full rack rate.

Also, there is a direct covered access to the mall surrounding the monorail station. The bar of the hotel offers a great view of the street of Seattle, and fine cocktails. The room was on the small side and did not have a safe even though it is offered at the reception for free.The complimentary wireless internet access was a great help to do some research while in town.A note: We do not know why but there was always a distinct scent of pizza in the hallways and the lobby area....... maybe from the adjoining mall and food court???????

<Content>Trust me, it's great! We just returned from our first trip to Seattle. We booked Mayflower Park hotel based on comments on this site so we thought we'd share our own experience to add to the mix. we were so happy we stayed here. Every detail, every request (early check-in, rollaway, family package tickets) was ready and waiting when we arrived. our room was fantastic and our children are still talking about the great hotel with TWO bathrooms in our one deluxe room. The location was great. Stores, shopping, and sites are all nearby or easy to access by monorail /shuttle. The staff was helpful and friendly (the concierge a little less so.) We had drinks at the bar which was nice but pricey. We had dinner at Andaluca's which was fine but nothing spectacular and somewhat slow service even when it wasn't busy. Overall, our stay was great and we hope to return one day!

<Content>Great location...great hotel! What a wonderful find! We found this hotel on the internet and it sounded nice, but didn't know if we might find some shortcomings that weren't divulged on their web site once we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised, as the place was just as nice (even nicer) than we expected. A very attentive staff, a classic old-hotel feel, yet equipped with most of the amenities you find in newer facilities. The location was perfect -- we couldn't have been more centrally located. Just about 4 blocks from the Pike's market, right in the heart of the downtown shopping and dining district, around the corner from the monorail stop to the Seattle Center (it was down while we were there, but they have a shuttle bus operating in the meantime). There's even direct access from the hotel to the underground bus line that's free within the downtown area. The beds were comfortable, the concierge very helpful...just a wonderful place to stay -- with the delightful character from an era that existed before the big hotel chains arrived on the scene. The only negative was the bar/lounge that's adjacent to the elevators. The drinks they served were marvelous, but unlike the rest of the hotel, they do allow smoking in the bar. So the smoke odor tends to drift into the hotel lobby/elevator area, which was unfortunate (especially since, being from California, we're used to hotels, bars  restaurants which are completely smoke-free). It would have been nice if they could have separated the bar from the rest of the hotel with doors, so the smoke stayed in the bar and didn't drift into the hotel area. Other than that, no complaints!

We had a deluxe single which was a spacious corner room with a large seating area. THe staff was gracious and helpful and the price reasonable for Seattle in Season. Location is also wonderful as you can walk to almost everthing and or take convenient bus service.

<Content>Always Satisfied I have stayed at this hotel many, many times and I have always been happy. The fact that it is attached to a mall is great as I often travel alone and it is nice to be able to pop over to the mall without having to walk any where alone. The rooms are always very clean and comfortable.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! We just spent three nights at the Mayflower Park and we had a wonderful experience. It is a neat old hotel with a lot of charm. The staff is friendly, and the concierge folks are very helpful. There is hardly any noise from the other rooms. Good beds; not rock-hard like some hotels. Oliver's, the bar, is a bit pricey, but so convenient (though it would be better if it was nonsmoking like the rest of the hotel). We had an upper floor room with a great view of the Space Needle. The location can't be beat, either. We walked everywhere. The concierge helped us rent a car for one day and we explored the Olympic Peninsula. My husband would have preferred staying somewhere cheaper, but he couldn't deny that we had a nice experience at the Mayflower Park.

<Content>Happy, happy Traveling with an 18 year old granddaughter, we were concerned two nights in a botique hotel might be too much. She loved the mall being connected to the hotel, she adored the play the hotel got tickets for (Millie), she thought it wonderful Norstroms was across the street and her favorite store, Ann Taylor's Loft was nearby. Everyone was very friendly (even cab drivers) in the city but the hotel staff and restaurant staff were superior. I can't think of a single bad thing to say. I really want to return soon.

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel!!!! Great hotel with excellent staff!! Friendly and efficient front desk. Called to confirm reservation and Reservations Clerk was extremely nice. Hotel matched rate found on internet. Room was beautifully decorated with Boutique feel. Andaluca (sp?) was Yummy! Full Breakfast for our kids under 10 was free, Olivers' Lounge had the BEST martinis. Could not have asked for better location... we walked to pretty much EVERY attraction. DEFINITELY would stay again. Can't say enough!

<Content>Basic Room With No Special Employee Attitude A very good downtown Seattle location with snobbish attitude at the desk, friendly luggage handlers, outdated interior in need of modernization. Rooms are fairly basic, a bit awkward and small but nonetheless clean. Noisy ambiance due to proximity of the mono-rail which blurts out a super sounding horn at all hours of the night. A nice mall near the hotel, restaurants, Pike Street market and other places within walking distance. Avoid more seedy areas at night, located near Pike Market. A bit pricey for an independent hotel but I would definately think about staying here again if they improve their customer relations skill.
