<Content>If you like planes... I travelled to Germany with my Grade 11 Class last year, and I loved the whole experience! This hotel was one of the nicer ones we stayed in, but the Tegel airport is literally right next door.. The planes didnt bother us too much as we were so tired we went right to sleep, but you can definitely hear them!The lobby is very spacious and modern with Wi-Fi to use, as well as computers. They were VERY patient with our group. The staff seemed very pleasant and helpful. A bit of a jaunt to the sights of Berlin, but a very nice place to stay!

<Content>Nice and clean place to stay I had a chance to stay at the Mercure Airport Hotel Berlin Tegel in March 2008. I was there in Berlin to attend ITB Fair. This hotel is far from the main city but it had big clean rooms with all the modern facilities and is very reasonably priced.

<Content>Excellent Value Stayed one night prior to flying back to the States. Location is excellent for access to the airport--walking distance if you wish. Rooms are small, but clean and comfortable. We had two adult parents and one adult child. Restaurant was satisfactory. And the hotel price was an excellent value, better than we are accustomed to in the U.S. Not luxury, but a cut above a basic hotel.

<Content>A COMFORTABLE HOTEL First time in Germany, I booked a hotel nearby the Tegel Airport. Stayed for a few nights (3 I think). As soon as I arrived at Tegel from Zurich on Air Berlin, I went to the Information desk to ask how to get to the hotel. Apparently, I had to go to the next building (terminal) for the pick-up bus to Mercure. After 4 minutes walk, I got to the other terminal, and went to the information desk and the lady said she would call the hotel for pick-up and I was asked to wait outside the terminal (10 seconds walk). The mini van arrived and the journey to the hotel took about 6 minutes.The hotel is quite nice, you will see a lot of big trees outside and you can go for a walk. The lobby is fairly big and there are two computers offering free internet. The check-in was quick. There's a restaurant and a sitting area (lounge) and there's a swimming pool outside where you can also sit/have a drink.My room was clean with a small bathroom. It's a copy of Novotel Zurich (if you have stayed at Novotel Zurich then, you can imagine this Mercure room that I got). Nice comfortable bed, clean linen etc. with shower gel/shampoo/soap in the bathroom. I don't remember making my own coffee there so I don't think there was tea/coffee making facilities in the room. TV channelswere OK, mostly in German language.I went for a walk during my stay to the airport (20 minutes walk) since that is the only place of civilisation whereby you can get newspapers and food if you don't want to eat in the hotel. There is a petrol station on the way to the airport with a shop called Bistro. I was delighted thinking of the hot foods/pastries that I was going to buy at Bistro, but when I went inside the only hot thing they sell is coffee! You can buy chocolate and junk food here though.On my first day out in Berlin, I took the free mini van service from the hotel (you have to request for this, say 10 mins before you need it) to Tegel and caught a bus into Berlin. I took X9 bus and paid 2.10 Euro for a single journey, per person. The journey by bus to Berlin (Zoo Garden) took about 25 minutes. On my return journey, I asked the info centre at Tegel airport to call Mercure for the pick-up for me.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised! We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to flying out of Berlin. For the rock-bottom price we paid for the room via the hotel's website, we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. The hotel is almost IN the airport (you can see the runway out of the window) but there is almost no airport noise. There's an excellent shuttle service that takes you to the airport within minutes. You can get into the city by public transport, but it is a bit of a trek (shuttle then bus then U-bahn) so I wouldn't recommend it for exploring the city. The breakfast buffet is good, but not included in all room prices. Staff are friendly and helpful. We'd be happy to stay here again.

<Content>Convenient for early flight or late arrival We stayed here for one night since we had an early flight and it was a very nice hotel, especially for the price. Our room was big, very clean, and aesthetically pleasing. You are right in the airport though so this is not a great place to stay while you are trying to explore Berlin. Also, the restaurant was a little pricey and fancy for our taste so we had a hard time finding dinner. They will order pizza delivery for you but it is not good at all! The shuttle service was fantastic; the first shuttle leaves at 5am and when you need a ride to or from the airport they are there in just a few minutes. Overall, we were very happy with this hotel.

<Content>Great location right at airport This hotel was very nice and the location was excellent! The price was reasonable per room. Breakfast was provided but not included in the price and we did not take advantage of it. We did eat dinner in their very nice restaurant and found it delicious, although the service was slow and poor. The rooms are very basic, but clean and comfortable and quiet. There was a pool but we did not use utilize this either because it was outdoors and quite cool. The front desk staff were super! We were able to check in and out quite easily, and there was an added bonus - there is a large electronic screen display in the lobby which shows the current flights and gates for departure at the airport. This was an incredibly useful feature. This hotel also offers free shuttle service to the airline gates.

<Content>Only on night spent We had just spent the last two weeks in Czech Republic and were flying out of Berlin back to the USA. We booked the hotel because it would have been a 5 hour drive  we were leaving early in the morning. The price was just right. This was one of the better hotels we were in. The beds were very comfortable. the staff was so friendly and even ordered a pizza for us as the pizza place did not speak english. It is just a short walk or drive from the airport. So if you miss the shuttle bus and don't have much luggage you can walk to the hotel. We had walked back after dropping the rental car off at the airport. This was a great airport hotel.

<Content>Perfect for our stay This property was beautifully and efficiently decorated. The staff were very helpful, efficient, welcoming and professional. My husband and sixteen year old son and I shared a room with double bed and fold out couch. It was spacious enough to meet our needs, and beds were comfortable. It is perfectly located for quick access to Tegel airport and the free shuttle is a bonus. The property is close to quick bus access and the staff was very helpful in helping us to use both bus as well as hotel shuttle to meet our sightseeing needs. The breakfast was not included in our rate, which is not too surprising given the excellent rate for such a nice hotel. We did enjoy the lavish breakfast buffet once, but it's a bit much in price and quantity unless you are counting on sustenance to last the day. Would definitely return.

<Content>Good Experience I stayed here for a night - 30 July 2007. I was given a twin room. Breakfast included. The room was very comfortable and clean. Nice bathroom. Only compliants - Broadband access was too costly and you are expected to carry your luggage on your own to your room......this is an airport hote...people arrive with bags and bags. They could do with a porter service.

<Content>Better Than Expected I booked this hotel for one night because we were arriving late from London - about 11pm. The price was right - 47 euros for a room. We ran into a little trouble when we arrived. The free shuttle bus ends at 11pm and we just missed the last one. We could not get any of the taxi drivers to take us because it was such a small fare. However, I called the hotel using the free dedicated phone in the airport terminal and the man on reception sent one within five minutes. Great service. The hotel room was much better than I expected for the money - a decent size, beautiful clean sheets, two twin beds and spotless throughout. All the staff were very helpful and polite. I speak German but they all spoke great English for anyone who doesn't. We didn't stay for breakfast as we were leaving for central Berlin first thing in the morning - only a 15 to 20 minute cab ride away. The checkout was quick, friendly and the receptionist called us a cab at once. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs an overnight stay at Tegel.

<Content>Ok if you get it cheap I got a cheap rate by booking well in advance. It certainly isn't worth it's standard room rate.I was on the 2nd floor. If your room number is in the 20's or above (eg 225, 326), be prepared for a looong hike to your room.There was no wireless access to my room (because it was so far away from the access point I assume). There was cabled access, but reception had no cables left.The restaurant is almost 5 star quality (and comes priced accordingly). As someone who arrived off a flight at 9pm and was on another flight at 7am, I only wanted a quick, basic, cheap meal. Even a burger or hot dog would have done. Ended up eating the chocolate in the mini-bar in my room.There is a piece of carpet missing about halfway along the corridor on the 2nd floor. If you get a room near this area, you may want to change rooms, as other guests rolling their luggage onto the exposed concrete are going to keep you up all night.

<Content>just fine for what it is this hotel was just fine - tastefully decorated rooms, quiet, comfortable, convenient airport shuttle. got a 49 euro rate on the internet and thought that was worth it for what we needed, which was transportation from the airport the first day and to the airport the next. however, beware of other fees- breakfast is 14 euros a person, they charge for internet access, etc etc...you could easily spend more on extras than you paid for the room! also bathrooms don't appear to have been updated in awhile.

<Content>Bad Experience I stayed at this hotel one night after getting into Tegel at night and leaving that next morning. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was checked in and given a key card. Mind you, it was about 11 PM and I was pretty tired. So, I went up to my room, inserted the key card and opened the door. I was greeted by a shocked Hallo from some poor German woman who was already in that room. They gave me a room with someone else already in it. I must have scared the daylights out of that poor woman. So I walked back down to the check in desk and told them what had happened. The clerk then gave me another key card to another room. While I was there, one of the guests called to report an intruder (me, I'm guessing). From overhearing some of that conversation in my very broken German, I think a weak apology was given, and that was it. After I got to my new room (very carefully opening the door this time), I finally got some peace and quiet. The bathroom was fine and functioned well, but the bed was not very comfortable and I did not get much sleep.My biggest complaint is that I don't think the woman I walked in on due to the incompetence of the hotel staff was compensated in any way.Upon coming back to Berlin I stayed at the Hilton instead. Was it more expensive? You betcha. Was the room more comfortable? By leaps and bounds. Was the stay more restful? Absolutely. Even the more complicated transit to and from the hotel was nothing compared to the overall better facalities at the Hilton.
