<Content>Clean and convenient After reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant about staying here. But the hotel is fine. The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean but basic. Breakfast is ok, not great, but fine and the rolls are not stale. Everything you need and a very good location. As to the smell referred to in one of the reviews, I got a whiff of this smell in various places in the old part of Barcelona. I imagine it's to be expected in old cities. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Avoid this place The hotel is in a good location, just off Las Ramblas and near metro stops, shopping, bars and restaurants. Breakfast that is provided consists of two stale rolls, a stale muffin, juice and coffee. After changing rooms twice, I noticed that the rooms have a very bad funky smell, like the sewer is backed up or something. I actually went out and bought some air freshener to try and mitigate the smell to little avail. This hotel is VERY popular with the younger crowd so if you鈥檙e looking for someplace quiet, this is not it. The beds have seen better days and I could actually feel the springs through the mattresses. The air conditioning and electricity goes off and on starting around 3pm and WIFI access is only available on a random basis in the common areas on the first floor. The beds are made each day, air con turned off, windows left closed. The rooms are not cleaned daily and I had to ask for fresh towels more than once. The staff is somewhat rude, not helpful with directions, metro info or anything else. Basically, it is overpriced for what you get and not some place I would recommend unless you鈥檙e desperate to stay in this area.

<Content>Friendly but loud My friend and I booked well in advance and requested a room with balcony onto the street - because we thought it would be romantic. They were very kind when we arrived and throughout our stay and gave us what we wanted - a balcony onto the street. It was lovely sitting out on it and watching the world go by, being part of the beautiful balcony lined skinny streets. But, boy, was it loud when we wanted to sleep on Friday night! There is double glazing but it doesn't quite seal shut (though I was happy it was secure from the outside) so the room was pretty noisy. Other than that, brilliant, though the breakfast rolls were a little hard...Hot chocolate was divine! Price was fair, found it a little expensive, but I'm a cheapskate!

<Content>Warning - never stay here!! I would not recommend this hotel at all. The room was disgusting, the lights did not work in the corridor so it was in complete darkness when trying to check in at night time, the window would not close let alone lock, the airconditioner did not work and the phone did not work. The staff member could not care less, and in fact told me to leave. This was at 2am, and I found another hotel, but this staff member was actually physically aggressive, standing in the doorway, shouting at me, and breaking my luggage trying to force me to stay after telling me to go. Then after all that they charged me!I have stayed in many hostels before, if I can give you any travel advice at all, it would be to NEVER stay here.

<Content>Excellent stay with 22 2nd Yr Business students! Hotel was booked though an educational travel agency. After reading some reviews we were a little nervous. This was totally unfounded! Hotel staff were very patient, especially considering our party consisted of 22 all over 18 students! Rooms were clean and quite charming. Located right in the heart of things with good access to public transport, the beach, shops, resturaunts etc. Great city, but do be aware of pickpockets - do not use rucksacks strapped to backs. Our party thoroughly enjoyed the 4 day residential and I am now in the process of booking again for next year! !

<Content>Def will return! This place was a life saver.....was staying at the hotel Opera down the street, and couldnt stand the noise, paper thin walls and tiny tiny bathroom..every place was full and I happened upon Hotel Peninsular . Both Alex and Jose Antonio both were so sweet and concerned for me and how miserable i was they got me a room for the following 8 nights. I WAS SO HAPPY when i walked into my room, with a double bed, en-suite bathroom with huge tub and shower and faced the back....i never had any problems , room cleaned and sheets and towels immaculate, granted the breakfast is sparse in compar. to us super sized americans, but believe me it beats paying over $10.00 u.s.d. for a small coffee and croissant right down the street! very very close to the Baqeria Market....so convenient to bring back cheese and wine to room at night..... I CANT SAY ENUF NICE THINGS ABOUT THIS PLACE, but esp. the wonderful staff they have working for them. I hope to return one day.

<Content>awful! This was the most awful hotel Ive ever stayed in! it was down a narrow alleyway and the smell was just unbearable. There were about 50 of us staying here and about 5 rooms had to be changed because of the smell in the rooms. Also we came home one night and found a mouse running around the room.....breakfast consisted of a bun and 2 rolls and that was it! i wouldnt reccommend this hotel at all!

<Content>Wouldn't stay there again We stayed in this hotel only for an overnight stay because it was close to the airport. Overall it was a good hotel being a 1* but it felt like sleeping in a corridor cause we could hear all the people in the other rooms talking and there was alot of noise. Staff spoke English but didn't look very happy and the beds were infact two single beds while we had booked a room with a double bed. Although it was a clean hotel and very good location, right in the centre of girona I don't think I would want to go back there again.

<Content>Poor Hotel, Poor place Recently visited Barcelona along with 20,000 football supporters expecting huge things from the City. Due to a scramble to find tickets, i unfortunately did not get to see a lot of the city, however as the hotel was yards away from La Ramblas then at least we were supposedly in the place to be. Peninsular is down a side street which if not busy, i could see as not being a very pleasant walk. Into the hotel and reception is dated and scruffy with the lift just simply in a terrible state. Room was not very clean, paint coming off the ceiling, toilet not flushing correctly, no shower curtain, no lock on the toilet door, dated furniture, no television and only one plug point for charging phone.In the 25 hours i spent awake in Barcelona, i witnessed someone chasing 2 pick-pockets, i caught one physically in the act with someone beside me and i saw 2 girls reduced to tears as all their money and cards had been stolen. My friend also had 550 euros stolen. We were offered all sorts at the end of the hotel street from less than desirable people and it simply left a bitter taste in my mouth.I would certainly never take my family to Barcelona and if i had to give it a second go, then Peninsular will be firmly at the bottom of any list i compile of places to stay.No better than a hostel to be honest.

<Content>Clean, well run Budget Hotel in Barcelona We stayed two nights in mid October 2007 after emailing the hotel a few weeks in advance of our arival. The reservation process went smoothly.1. LOCATION: The hotel is located on a side street, about 100 yards off the Ramblas, near the Opera Building. Rick Steve's review mentioned the street as a little bit Seedy at night. In my opinion it is fine. It's well lit, and yes, there are some oung kids walking up and down it that look a little tough, but they are harmless. There is alot of traffic and I wasn't worried. 2. ROOM. Our room was just great. Room 114 on the 1st floor, which is also the lobby floor with all the chairs and tables, which I didn't really see many people using. There were notes posted saying that the table area was not to be used after 9pm, to keep the talking noise down. Our room had a window that looked our onto this lobby area, with a solid shutter to close for privacy. We didn't want or need a window that looked out on to the street. We simply walked up some stairs from the main entance floor to our room. The lift is available, but slow and smallish. I think you would want a room on a lower floor. Thier were two town beds that my partner and I slid together, worked just fine. Air Conditioning worked when we got the remote form the front desk. Bathroom was clean and had soap available. Large Armoire, desk and night stand were just fine. I thought our room was a perfect size. InSuite bath.3. AMMENITIES: A very well run breakfast of 3 kinds of rolls, butter, jams, juices, and coffee is avalable 8-10am in a nice dining area, which is well attended. Front desk help was very courteous and helpful...I very was impressed. One internet terminal is available, but I didn't use.In my opinion, for 75 Euros this is a great deal in Barcelona. The place is a former nun's convent, so it just adds to the charm and mystique of the place. Very clean I would Highly Reccommend of for teh budget concious traveler. Email me any questions you may have. ~Bart

<Content>Clean, spacious and excellent location. Would stay again. Just off the busy La Rambla the Hotel Peninsular location is fantastic: being within a short walking distance of most of Barcelona's attractions. The hotel is basic but very clean.Most if not all of the staff are friendly, and will appreciate it if you make an effort to talk to them in Spanish. We stayed during festival week in Barcelona and the hotel was full. Bear in mind before you book that this hotel is very popular with students, so it can get a bit noisy at night. We didn't get back till late most nights so we didn't really find it a problem and the staff at the hotel asked people to keep it down if and when they did come in late. We only went to breakfast once during our 9-day stay, as we preferred to go to a cafe instead. Breakfast is nothing to get excited about and consists of 2 rolls and a cake. Don't bother looking for meals on La Rambla, they're pricey and bland, instead we went to the gothic quarter most nights. Just around the corner from the hotel (the first turning off the road the hotel is on as you walk to La Rambla) there's a good restaurant/ cocktail bar and a organic vegetarian restaurant where we went on a few occasions and wasn't disappointed. I would stay here again as its fantastic value for money and as I mentioned before the location is excellent.

<Content>Think twice before staying here The location of this hotel was very convenient. The evening desk clerk was very nice. It was extremely noisy - there was a group of 70 teenagers staying there. We watched while the night clerk freaked out and started screaming (and wouldn't stop) at them and they weren't really doing anything wrong - there was just a lot of teenagers at one time in the lobby as they had just returned for the evening. The breakfast wasn't anything to brag about. We were due to leave in the early morning and tried to pay our bill (they only accept cash or traveler's checks) the night before. The exchange rate was posted as 70 Euros for $100. The clerk would not let us pay the bill. Early the next morning, the exchange rate was posted as 65 Euros for $100. The clerk was extremely rude when I explained that I thought we should be given the higher exchange rate since we had tried to pay the night before. I even emailed them after I got home as I thought this was not right. I did not get any response.

<Content>Only good thing was the location! Thought I鈥檇 had discovered a great find when I booked this hotel and encouraged by the positive comments on here at 75 euro's including breakfast thought it was a bargain. However as soon as I arrived wished I had stayed at my 1st hotel slightly further out. The reception staff were rude questioning my booking even though I had it in black and white. The room it's self felt like a prison cell, sparsely furnished and dark, not a place you would feel happy to spend anymore time in then to just sleep, and the so called breakfast consisted of a stale roll, muffin and bitter coffee. If value and location are the most important factors to you then stay here, if not you can find hotels 100 times better slightly further out at the same price.

<Content>great place, great value, great location For the price (we paid 75 euros per night for a double with bathroom/toilet) this place is excellent.The location could not be much better if you want to be near the La Rambla which is only a couple of minutes walk away (if that). The room was always clean and well made. Though messages here suggest the staff were not friendly I found quite the opposite they were very cheery and helpful. It is not luxury but then you would not expect it to be given the price and the very central location. I have no reason to fault staff or hotel.

<Content>Well situated, good budget hotel! We arrived and found the hotel with no problems, just a couple of minutes walk from the vibrant Las Ramblas (get off at Liceu Metro stop). We were pleasantly surprised after reading some reviews on this website which were sometimes negative. The Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel has some great features, especially the atrium in the centre. You could see some history here, unlike many modern hotels. The room was basic but was ok for us as we are young travellers and were hardly ever in. You don't need luxury when the whole of the city is on your doorstep. I would ask for a room with a balcony or window if you don't mind a bit of noise at night (ours didn't have a window so we couldn't tell what the weather was like!).If you are travelling on a shoestring, we would recommend that you go further into town for food and drink, as La Ramblas is very pricey. Across the road a few blocks down is Placa Reial (sp?) which has some great bars with nice food and drink and brilliant atmosphere without the huge pricetag. There is also a supermarket on La Ramblas where you can buy cheap food to take to a picnic when you are saving the pennies. Get the tube to Parc De La Citudella (Arc de Triomp stop).Enjoy and keep an eye on your bag/camera as pickpockets are apparently rife in that area. The tarrif at the hotel is 拢50 for a double room so bear in mind if booking with travel agent as we paid nearly 拢70.

<Content>not a plastic tourist hotel I have stayed at the peninsular several times- the family who run thehotel are really friendly, the rooms have been renovated without trashing the atmosphere since the days they were prepared to take student parties. The atmosphere is really calm, stepping out of the Ramblas into the hotel's central atrium. the hotel has great history,having been a convent, a brothel, and host to art exhibitions by artists like Rebecca Horn.The only discomfort i've ever experienced there was the noise of some drunken English middle class tourists, but a call to the desk had them silent in minutes.This hotel feels like Barcelona, not 'Anywhere' and if you are a budget traveller, who wants to be at the centre of things, this one should do very well.

We had a room overlooking the atrium on our first stay and wouldn't recommend this any noise carries.Breakfast can only really be described as okay.Staff were helpful and knowledgable, rooms clean, front balcony room was amazingly quiet for a major city.Would stay there again.

<Content>Moderate hotel I broke my ankle in Barcelona and had to change hotel because the one I stayed at required me to walk upstairs. So I was recommended to stay at Hotel Peninsular. While the staff was quite friendly and helpful, I found the location to be less than ideal, especially for someone who was disabled. This hotel is located on a pedestrian street so there was no way for me to take a taxi. I had to hop with my one leg for a long way before I could get to a street. Second the room was clean but very noisy. We had a room facing the pedestrian street, and there was no way to sleep at night! I won't go back to this hotel. There are better hotels with similar prices at better locations in Barcelona.

<Content>Fantastic place I was looking for somewhere to stay that was inexpensive but clean and central, and booked this after reading previous reviews on Trip Advisor. I stayed here for 3 nights in June with a friend and it was ideal for us (70 Euros a night for twin room). It's situated at a fairly short walk down La Ramblas from the bus stop in Plaza de Catalunya (where the airport shuttle drops you). The hotel is in a side street off La Ramblas but not too far off. It's very clean, and I think all rooms have private bathroom (ours had a shower and a bath). The price included breakfast which was pretty basic but good enough (rolls, orange juice and tea/coffee). The inside of the building itself is lovely and feels quite peaceful. The reception staff were helpful and let us store our luggage on the last day. I would definately stay here again!

Great location in the side streets of Las Ramblas, a couple of steps to the action but far enough from the noise. Very clean and the housekeeper did not even take the tip I left for her. Front desk staff was very friendly, helpful and really concerned for the safety of their guests, which means this is not the place to bring back your one-night stands. I would definitely stay here again =)

<Content>OK for price I stayed in Hotel Peninsular for 10 days in June 2005 and could not complain. The price is very acceptable and if your used to budget hotels then Hotel Peninsular is no different from most. I found the staff helpful, speaking perfect English and assisted me by not having to change rooms half way through my stay bec my room was proir booked for one day out of my 10.The breakfast was basic but you can help yourself to coffee and juice, there is no limit. The rooms are cleaned daily and new sheets provided. I noticed families, couples, students and singles staying and the noise was not too bad. The location is great too, more or less off a side street central to the Ramblas.I surveyed numerous hotels during my stay in Barca bec I shall be returning in 2006 but found this one in the top 3 for value and location.

<Content>Beautiful budget hotel This hotel was exactly what we expected it to be, a no frills budget hotel. We were just looking for a place to sleep at night, why would you want to spend time in a hotel room when you are in one of the most beautiful cities in the world? We didn't have any problems with noisy guests, I suppose it just depends on who the other guests are at the time that you are staying. The staff were amazing, very friendly and helpful. We arrived at 6.30am and asked if we could store our bags until check-in, instead they allowed us to go straight to the room (you cannot imagine how happy we were after spending the night in the airport). On the day we left, they allowed us to store our bags there until we left for the airport at 8pm. I would definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone that is wanting to stay the night in a stunning centrally located hotel, for less than $100.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, friendly staff. I stayed at the Peninsular with my family for 4 nights in July 2001. The family room was basic, but very clean. Good bath-shower, wc. I found the staff to be helpfull. Inside the hotel it is really nice, however the narrow street outside looks a little grubby, but we never had any problems. I would be more concerned on La Rambles from bag snatchers and pick pockets. We had a small balcony looking over the narrow street, great for people watching.The location is excellent as its only a few mins walk from La Ramblas next to the opera house and not far from the excellent market. Great places to eat all around, eat off La Ramblato save a little cash if you wish. For an excellent day out use the Turistic Bus from the Plaza De Catalonia at the top of La Ramblas to travel about the city, about 15 euros, hop on, hop off as you wish all day long. Great trip....good value hotel, clean with nice staff.

<Content>Great value! I stayed at the Peninsular for 4 nights and found it very accomodating with a terrific location, close to everything. I traveled as a single and received a room with 2 twin beds for 50 Euro. I would definately recommend this hotel for the budget traveller who expects no frills. The staff was friendly, the rooms and hotel are kept clean and has a quaint feel to it. I agree that you can hear people come and go, so if you are a light sleeper earplugs would help. I had no problem though. Remember to bring a wash cloth if you use them, as they are not provided. Breakfast was standard fair, an assortment of 3 types of bread, coffee  orange juice. They do have a hair dryer you can use from the lobby, but you can find one for cheap if you don't have one with proper outlet. Definately a great bargain!

<Content>Good position The good point about this budget hotel is its proximity to Las Ramblas and from there to Calalunya square for the buses etc.,the waterfront, tourist information and gothic area. It is down a narrow, mostly traffic free, street off Las Ramblas, which connects to the Montjuic area so lots of people about. It is very clean, the rooms are small, very, very basic but the bathroom was fine. It did have air conditioning. Other Tripadvisors' recommendation of being out all day and just using the room to sleep in is about right but it does help to bring ear plugs, you will need them. The hotel has an atrium with small walkways all around on each of the four floors so the sound of anything carries up and around. The old doors have gaps under (it was a former convent) and on several nights it was very noisy as students use it and were coming back late at night when we were in bed. The breakfast was two fresh bread rolls, butter, jam and a little plain cake with tea/coffe and some orange squash (not fresh juice). The owners were friendly and kept things in the hotel safe for us. It is a good budget hotel for a short sightseeing break but I would not like to have it as a main holiday or for more than 5/6 days. A minus for us was that we had booked a twin room (for two girlfriends) and despite confirming this again by fax only got a small double bed which they couldnt change until the last night and then we couldnt be bothered to change. Just a word of warning: please be so careful with your bags, my friend's rucksack was tampered with on an escalator but nothing stolen at the Barcelonabus station which was full of unsavory types and the bus driver had to chase some off when we arrived. Do all the usual safety checks - there are now lots of police about all over the city (but not at this bus station at night) and everyone tells you to watch your bags. There is even a notice on the breakfast table telling you not to leave your bag - it does make even a seasoned traveller a little alarmed! Rucksacks are such an easy target especially those with easy opening zips at the front and do look so touristy.

<Content>Cosy place to stay and such a kind stuff The Peninsular Hotel is a perfest place to stay - I am quite often in Barcelona and I always stay at the Peninsular - the stuff is gorgeous - always friendly, always good to chat with - like a big familiy. - Yes it麓s a cheap hotel, and the hotel can not be blamed, when guests come home late at night, making noise !It not fair when guest grumble about the Peninsular - it is cheap, perfectly located, the rooms are clean and it is nonsens to expect luxury if you consider the low prices of the hotel! The hotel has got a special atmosphere, as it was a convent in former times - and you can trust the whole stuff perfectly - I have got a nice friendship with the whole stuff and everytime I arrive in my favourite hotel, I am given such a lovely wellcome - so the hotel is like a second home for me - I can really recommend it - if a guest wants so have luxury rooms, should go to another hotel, which is more expensive. I feel so cosy and good at the Peninsular and bad reviews concerning this hotel are simply not fair!!! I absolutely can recommend teh Peninsular - if you want an really nice stuff, clean and cheap rooms, located perfectly to teh center and to the marvellous LICEU Opera house - choose the Peninsular ! ! ! ! ! ! !

<Content>dont trust the staff here! Although most of the reviews of this hotel tell a fairly accurate picture- central, basic. attractive building, noisy and so on, we met an unexpected problem when we brought a group of 26 students. Despite very careful bookings through our agent Studylink on arrival (late, with tired students) we found that the hotel had put us in rooms where students were expected to share beds- claiming that this was normal practice. Basically the hotel had delibearatley overbooked and told us barefaced lies to cover up, knowing there was nothing we could do about it. We had Spanish speakers with us but could do nothing- it was a take it or leave it attitude, and the same thing happened when some of our female staff were intimidated by german students in the room next door over the following days. We got around the problem of rooms by moving beds and putting some students in another hotel, which was paid for eventually by Studylink, but it made an unpleasant start to the visit. So don't trust the staff, and be prepared for them to try it on and cause problems.

<Content>Pretty basic, noisy, good location My wife and I stayed here a few nights after scoring a cheap flight to Barcelona. Peninsular was something like our sixth or seventh choice, and it felt that way. While an old convent sounds quaint, it means basic rooms with second-hand furniture -- including a tiny double bed -- and no natural light. We didn't get much noise from the outside, but the thin walls and doors left us at the mercy of neighbors, and the couple across the hall were pretty loud, especially slamming doors in the morning. (And we didn't sleep in that much, believe me.)The only real positive beyond price -- and that's questionable -- is location. This hotel is only a few steps off Las Ramblas, and it wasn't a horrible walk to Montjuic, either. Easy access to a couple of subway stops, and while the area to the west can be shady, this generally is a safe location. Try El Pollo Rico across the street for lunch. Good price, good food.In the end, this will do in a pinch, but it's best to spend all day seeing Barcelona and come back exhausted do you won't mind the room so much.

<Content>Really OK! We went to Barcelona to celebrate New Year 2005! Even in this season it's very nice to visit this city! At first we were a bit anxious because I read some less pleasant reviews, but none of them are true! You can expect all the comfort you need. The beds are fine and the bathroom has a good shower. It's basic but much better than some other **- hotels I've seen. Breakfast in the morning is more than enough and you'll only be hungry at lunchtime ... to have some tapas!Enjoy your stay at Peninsular!

<Content>Dont be put off by the bad reviews! I booked two nights at the Hotel Peninsular through STA travel, then looked on the web to see if I could find out anything more about the hotel. I was really upset when I found this site and read the reports about bedbugs!! I wished I'd checked it out before I booked! But it was too late to change it so I went along anyway, and ended up being pleasantly surprised. There was no sign of any bedbugs (we checked matresses and sheets, and we have no bites a week on). Both the room and shared washroom facilities were clean. The staff were friendly, and breakfast was perfectly adequate (bread, a muffin and tea/coffee/oj). The air conditioning worked a treat so we had a lovely cool nights sleep, and noise was never a problem, though we did invest in some earplugs after reading advice on this site. I think this is something worth doing no matter where you plan to stay, as the movements of the other guests are pretty much beyond a hotel's control!There was not much natural light in our room as the window faced into the building, but this also meant that there was no external noise from the street - a big plus in noisey Barcelona! The furniture was worn out (e.g. drawers wouldn't open fully, bedside table was on a slant etc.), but the beds were comfy. The large plant-draped foyer area is lovely to come back to. The hotel definately has character and we felt comfortble and totally at home there. The atmosphere is relaxed, and this makes it an oasis amongst the bustling busy streets.I would say don't be put off by the bad reviews on this site, but also don't expect a palace. The Hotel Peninsular is a fine place to stay, at an excellent price. If you want a base to enjoy the city of Barcelona from, this is a great choice.

<Content>Top-notch Hotel Have stayed in this Hotel a couple of times, once with my girlfriend and once with friends. Both times were great. I have seen much more expensive and more basic Hotels in Barcelona, but would recommemd this to anyone and will always go back. The location is perfect and near to Placa Real, Las Rambla and the Metro. Staff are great. If they have one ask for a room with a balcony, the view is not great but a balcony is always nice. I have seen complaints of bed bugs well I don't have any and rooms have always been totally spotless.

<Content>Awful hotel: mold, noise, cockroaches  Yes, this hotel is cheap and, yes, it has an interesting courtyard, but I cannot recommend staying there.It has the feel of a prison - or maybe that's just the fact that it used to be a convent: very basic rooms, my one had no windows, high and narrow doors and constant noise.My room had black mold on the bathroom ceiling and smelt awful. The mold formed black chains which hung down from the ceiling. I felt soiled and dirty just being in the room.On top of this, the noise is constant. The walls are paper-thin and you can hear everything, and I mean everything, that is going on, not just in adjacent rooms but in the hotel as a whole. Forget sleep - you're not going to get any.Luckily I never experienced bedbugs but certainly cockroaches scurrying around in the bathroom.After about 8 am, forget hot water. The strange thing is it didn't just turn cold - nothing came out of the tap at all.All together, I felt sullied staying in this hotel. It was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. Horrible!

<Content>Hotel with Charactor We came to Barcelona in April 2004 for a long Weekend , we had not booked any accommadation prior . We stumbled across the Hotel Peninsular and stayed three nights . The Hotel which was a convent was steeped in charactor and was unlike anywhere we had ever stayed . The accommmadation is basic but there are clean towells  bedding provided  rooms are clean .We found all staff very helpful  Friendly , Breakfast is basic  enough. The location is perfect , the price per night is very good , we would stay here again

<Content>Interesting, Clean and Friendly I stayed in this hotel in the summer of last year and I would like to put the record straight. This is a very clean hotel, an extremely interesting building, excellent location and very helpful and friendly English speaking staff.The rooms were spotlessly clean, the floors were clean, the towels were changed every day even though I was doing my bit for the environment by reusing them. The beds were comfortable and sheets were clean.Rooms had air conditioning that worked, was quiet at night, even though near the action.I admit that the rooms needed a little work on them but in a funny way it made the rooms charming.What made this hotel stand out from the rest was the charming atrium.As they say you get what you pay for! And for what you pay for at Peninsular you get and a bit more the history and friendliness too.Breakfast is good, typical continental style!! Breakfast is not supposed to be a feast after all!I would totally recommend this hotel.

<Content>Hotel workers Review We stayed in last week Feb 2004 I read all the reviews carefully B4 selecting this hotel. I wanted somewhere central but on a budget. This hotel is central - walk out the door turn right,left and you're on Las Ramblas in 3 mins! Okay- the side streets were a bit drab and a few of the characters around looked a bit rough but my wife and I felt quite safe even late in the evening . We actually walked around several of the local blocks including the red light district-it looks a bit run down but the people were fine. We never felt any problems in looking in any of the back/side street shops. We stayed 3 nights in the hotel- room clean (maid service every day),en-suite small compact bathroom with small bath  good shower. Breakfast was buffet service,plenty of coffee,bread etc but just go out the hotel to the market 3 mins away  get a great b'fast for a couple of Euros! I work in hotels - this ones good value for it's location (U try London these days!) and we'll certainly go back again :-)

<Content>Beautiful on the surface.... After seeing a photograph in a travel book, I stayed three nights at the Peninsular Hotel. I regret that I didn麓t find these reviews until I went searching the internet for another place to stay. The front desk staff was very friendly, and the Hotel has great charachter, but it would be better to ask to see the courtyard and check into the hotel across the street. Unsucessfully, I tried two different rooms at the Peninsular, hoping to find a little peace and quiet. The cackle of the freindly happy maids echoed off the tile courtyard by day, and the thunderous door slamming by the We麓re so tipsy that we don麓t realize anyone else might be sleeping at 4:00 a.m. crowd kept me-a noise seasoned New Yorker, from getting any sleep. I would have tried to call the front desk...but the disconnected telephones seem to only be in the rooms for decoration. I put up with the hole in the corner called the shower, and with the here麓s what you get continental breakfast, but what finally did me in was the thunderous pounding of the water pipes in the morning that literally shook my room. (I was told at check out that this was only a problem on the top (4th) floor. Once I checked into the beautiful Hotel Espana (same price across the street), and got some sleep- I was able to laugh at the whole Peninsular experience.

<Content>You get what you pay for We did save on money, by staying at the Peninsular. That was our main goal, to stay in a clean no-frills places to be able to do more with our travel money. So, we did accomplish that. The staff is friendly, and speak English. The location was ok, right off of the Ramblas, but the street seemed a little shady at night. We stayed in an attic room, which was roomy, there were three of us, and the room really had the capacity for four. The shower was a bit of an inconvenience, water got all over the floor no matter how careful you were, and the room always seemed damp because of this. We may stay at a more luxurious place next time, but it wasn't bad for the money, clean, good location, friendly staff.

<Content>Handy location We were at the hotel at the end of Novenber 2003 and were generally happy with the accomodation. The fifth floor comprises of six Attic Rooms. These have all been recently refurbished. It's true the rooms are spartan but ours was clean, the bed comfortable and the en suite facilities were bang up to date. The only problem was it took a few minutes for the hot water to arrive!. If your Spanish isn't up to scratch, no problem; the friendly staff speak excellent English. It is ideally located for La Rambla, only 150yds away. It isn't worth turning right at night leaving the hotel. I was reminded of the Thriller video!. The attic rooms comprise four doubles, one for three persons and one for four. If possible try to book one of these. Some of the other rooms looked a bit austere. NB Payment is by cash or travellers cheques only. At 70 euros per room not a bad deal.

<Content>Our Place in Barcelona We have stayed at this very well-placed, inexpensive small hotel several times over the past three years and regard it as 'our place' in Barcelona. The first time we came as visitors now we return, whenever we get the chance, as friends. The warm, friendly atmosphere is very welcoming, the rooms clean  comfortable and the staff very helpful. We have recommended the Peninsular to several friends who have also been delighted with its quiet serenity - unexpected in such a popular area just minutes off La Rambla!

<Content>Bitten to bits After one night in a horrible, dingy little pension, Hotel Peninsular seemed a much better choice: basic, yes, but clean, central and full of character. However, two days after returning to London, we are covered in enormous, itchy bed-bug bites. The thought of them crawling over us whilst we slept has somewhat clouded our memories of an otherwise wonderful holiday in Barcelona. You have been warned.

<Content>Covered in Bites, Itching to death The Hotel is quaint, the people friendly. The rooms are basic, showers have no curtains.All of the above is nothing next to the fact that I am covered in bed-bug bites and itching like crazy.Breakfast, a stale bread roll and small muffin.We stayed for 3 nights and thought it was decent until the bites appeared on the last day and have yet to vanish.Not a bad Hotel but they need to sort out the hygiene.

<Content>Great staff, lovely interior, no sleep. This is a very beautiful hotel. The Jugendstil courtyard is charming, and really one of a kind. I would even say it's worth a visit if you are staying in a nearby hotel. The staff was also very helpful and cheerful. BUT, all hotelrooms on all four floors have doors into the courtyard (elevator too). The closing doors sound like gunshots, which echo off the courtyard tiles and through the whole building right into the paper-walled rooms. With juniors getting home at 4:00, and seniors getting up at 8:00, this leaves little room for sleep... If you are deaf, or an insomniac, this hotel is perfect; otherwise try something else.

<Content>Peninsular Hotel is Value We read the Tripadvisor reviews before we travelled, and booked our October 2003 visit on the strength of the generally favourable comments about Hotel Peninsular. The hotel was excellent value for money. It is spartan and the decor of our (two) rooms has not been refurbished recently. Breakfast was a roll with butter and jam(and a little sponge cup cake), washed down with hot (or warm) liquids. But on all other value counts, it was excellent. The reception staff were characters; helpful, attentive, funny, memorable. The location is excellent, just 2 minutes from Las Ramblas. We will happily return.

<Content>Hotel with a "wow factor" verandar We were recommented this hotel as somewhere, clean, tidy, not posh and central with friendly helpful staff - and it was just that. It is a block off the center of Las Rambles. A block away from the metro. Is quiet and central what more could you want. Oh and as for the central verandar, it just has to be seen, with the hanging plants and the balconied corridors, its wonderful. Its a great place to stay if you don't do 5*.

<Content>What more do you want? When you go to such a beautiful city like Barcelona, do you really need anything more than good, clean cheap accommodation? After all - how much time will youi spend at the hotel? I stayed in Hotel Peninsular for 2 nights in May. The location is superb. Near to all the night life, the metro, the tour bus, the harbour and the beach. I think its great value for money as its good, clean accommodation in very nice surroundings and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I will be staying in the same place when I go to Barcelona again next year!

<Content>friendly people!!! I stayed in Hotel Peninsular early this June for 4 nights. Price is very good. Breakfast was ok. The room was quite big. We asked for a twin room but got a triple. The water in the bathroom was weak but we paid for the price... It was very hot in summer time. It will be good to fix the air-con...However, staff were very friendly and spoke very good English. The guy gave us advice on beware of pickpockets. My friend and I had bought so many stuff and misplaced our stuff... The staff MADE US A SHELF in one afternoon, when we went out!!! They were really helpful. They even lined up our luggage to the shelf... I will recommand this hotel to budget travellers, or stay there while weather is not that hot...

<Content>great place to stay We are currently staying at the Hotel Peninsular. The hotel is a lovely place with a festive atmosphere. Yesterday we met a group of German travelers in the veranda playing guitar and singing songs. We joined them and had a splendid time. The rooms are clean and plainly dcorated. the first night we stayed in a room without a bathroom (down the hall). Tonight and for 4 days afterward we stay in a room with a bathroom. Either room is more than acceptable. You cannot beat the price. The only point of concern is the street that the hotel is on si a little seedy if you go too far down. I never really feal in any danger however. No worse than any street in Anytown, America. Good times.

<Content>Good for the price With such a central location I expected it to be noisy and wasn't too bothered as I got back to the hotel late most nights anyway. I found it a pleasant environment to be in. However when my mate got a valuable nicked and we told the staff at reception they got incredibly defensive and even suggested that one of us had taken it! All we wanted were directions to the police station - at times like this it wouldn't hurt them to be slightly more sympathetic. Apart from this unpleasantness I enjoyed my stay here - the facilities where basic but not lacking in any way.

<Content>Look out for the bed bugs!!!!!! Unfortunately, my primary thought of Barcelona will be this dodgy hotel. I am 4 days into itching from bed bug bites - I was savaged! The staff, although friendly, just shrugged it off and said it happens. I had to wear long pants and sleeves, even when it was very warm, as the top of my back, arms and legs are the main affected areas - looks like I have measles!! Don't say I didn't warn you!

<Content>A gem in the midst of Barrio Chino I just returned from a two week stay at the Peninsular. This is a very basic hotel - but a light airy oasis compared to most hotels in this price range. The reception area and the courtyard is a true pleasure to come home to - and the charming staff/ owners are more than happy to give tips on where to go. And - more importantly - their recommendations fit our taste perfectly. Yes rooms are simple (do make the effort and buy a vase and a big bouquet of flowers from La Rambla - it makes a big difference!) as is the breakfast - but we actually made a round to have a look at other hotels within the same category - and if you are into very basic business hotels with stuffed rooms and wall-to-wall carpet in orange and brown - where they might provide cheese AS WELL AS jam with their rolls - and pay 90-100 Euros for it - go right ahead. I would stay at the Peninsular again and again. Just ask for the rooms in the attic :)

<Content>Good value for money Only about 50 yards from the centre of La Ramblas, so ideal location, very nice reception area, very friendly and helpful staff. The room was a bit cramped due to having a double and two single beds in it, but how much time do you want to spend in your room, in my case, only to sleep so no problem. The breakfast room and the rest of the interior was lovely, it was like being in a palm house, lots of plants everywhere, very high ceilings and a very spacious and light feeling. I went in January, and it got cold in the early evening but there was heating in the room if you wanted it. I would imagine the Peninsular to be very cool in summer. If you are after a luxury break, then maybe this is not for you, (well not based on my room anyway), but if you want pleasant, clean, friendly, centrally located accommodation at an affordable price, the Hotel Peninsular would fit the bill.

<Content>Save your pennies - stay at the Peninsular! We stayed at the Peninsular for four nights in May 2003. Impressive reception area and the indoor courtyard with the balconies made us gasp. Slightly different gasp when we opened the door of our room. Well, it was once a nun's cell! We'd been warned it was basic and it's definitely better than camping. It was tatty but clean and we will certainly visit Barcelona again and will stay at the Peninsular too - only next time I will buy a big bunch of flowers in the Ramblas to brighten the room up and bring coloured scarves to drape over the lights. Romantic it is not. The staff were great - very amenable and good humoured. The first thing the receptionist did was warn us about the pickpocketing scams and I recommend visiting **** before you go. We would not have wanted to walk much further down the street (away from the Ramblas) at night. The clientele ranged from backpackers to smart middle aged and older. Very noisy at night so we bought earplugs from the chemist a few doors away then no problem. Check out the frijoles and the creme catalunya at the restaurant Romesco in the Carer Saint Pau right by the Peninsular. The hotel and this restaurant are so cheap you will have plenty of spare cash for the very tasteful tourist momentoes and a splurge at the Camper shoe shop. They say you get what you pay for but I believe that you get more than you pay for at the Peninsular.

<Content>Still itching! We just returned from a four nights stay in Hotel Peninsular, which was recommended to us by a colleague. To tell the truth, we won't follow a recommendation of him again! Yes, the architecture of the building (courtyard) is quite nice and interesting. Yes, the staff is friendly and helpful. Yes. it is centrally located. However, seeing the first room, we decided to have a look into another one. It was not really an improvement. The rooms are really, really basic (you are lucky if you got a window). There was no curtain in the shower, so imagine how the bath looked like after two people went through it. There was a daily room maid, but obviously the cloth has not been changed for a long time. Sheets seemed to be O.K. - watching our skin today, you might get some sort of animals as a souvenir. This hotel is not that cheap as it is basic.
