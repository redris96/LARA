<Content>Loved the Sauna, power shower, steam room, wellness area, location We visited this hotel over Xmas 2008 while on vacation to Berlin. Overall, excellent value for money. After a day of sightseeing outside in very cold weather Berlin, it was a pleasure to come back to the hotel and relax downstairs in the wellness area. The rock sauna was in full operation (even over Xmas!), as was the steam room  showers. The recliners were great to curl up with a book in between the heat experiences. Fitness gym, Key lockers  towels all included. All the above were included in the cost of hotel; the solarium was a bit extra (6 euros i think), which we ran out of time ot visit. They had massages, treatments etc also available for additional cost. The sauna was huge, but steam room smaller. The pool which resembles a jacuzzi is actually a cold water plunge pool!!We had swimsuits on in the sauna, but the locals (germans) who were staying at the hotel were all 'au naturel'!!! The rooms were a good size, very comfy pillows, excellent power shower (missing it now that i'm back at home!), lockable safe, and cozy warm room temperature. The bathroom fixtures  fittings were basic (not fancy), but were definitely adequate for how little this hotel + flight cost. There was a fixed unit on the wall for shower gel/shampoo which you had to squeeze a bit hard, but manageable. Towels were thick, but not super-long/large. However, definitely adequate. It's not a 5 star hotel, so you shouldn't expect 5 star luxury/decadence, but it was definitely excellent value for money for a 4 star hotel. I give it 4 stars because of the wellness area downstairs. Without it, it would be a 3.5 star hotel.Another bonus was that it's right outside the underground tube station so very convenient. It was very easy to get here on the public transportation (bus) directly from the airport. I would recommend purchasing a red Berlin Welcome Card, which entitles you to unlimited travel for 72 hrs, including to/from airport  discounts off museums etc. Excellent value for money vs. taxi, which takes just as long to go from airport to hotel.Breakfast was very expensive (14 euros per person) with minimal vegetarian selection. Instead, i would highly recommend having brunch or dinner at one of the many veggie restaurants in berlin (eg Samadhi restaurant, or Good Time restaurant). See my reviews on www.happycow.net.There were no veggie items on their restaurant menu for dinner, however, directly across the road in Hotel Henriette, there's a restaurant called Shezan which did, and was convenient when tired / strapped for time.The reception staff were very helpful in locating items on a map, making dinner + concert reservations. Check out the hotel's website which is very helpful. Overall, definitely made the right decision to stay here while visiting berlin. Highly recommended!

<Content>Pleasant stay My wife and I, just got back from a 5-day stay at the hotel. In general, we have a very good impression about our stay. The hotel has many advantages: The rooms are very clean, they are spacious, and the bathroom is of excellent quality. Also, the hotel is situated just above the U-bahn Station Markishes Museum. Although the area doesn't have anything special you can do, (apart from dining at an opposite Indian Restaurant - which is not bad) by using the Underground you can go everywhere you want. (Small tip: Buy from the yellow automated machines a 48-hour or a 72-hour Welcome Card (ticket) , which gives you unlimited access to all means of transportation AND discounts to museums and city tours, it's worth it). The hotel also provides Wifi Access (which is NOT free, however) and has a nice sauna and fitness room, which are free to use. The fitness room is small, but still you can work out with no problems. The hotel also provides an indian-style massage, which is very expensive (120 euros for 1 hour). The breakfast is good, however it could still improve. The place where breakfast is being served is quite small, however, so if you go at peak times and the hotel is full, you could have to wait a few minutes before you sit (not very likely to happen, but it is possible). The hotel's staff is helpful and polite. Some (small) disadvantages: Room temperature is very high, and you cannot change it, and the bed is too soft. These are factors that did affect my sleep. At least, you can open the window for some fresh air. In general, very positive feelings about this hotel, you won't regret staying there.

<Content>Perfect hotel in a perfect location This is a perfect hotel in a perfect location. Within walking distance to Nikolai Viertel, Alexander Platz and Hackesche Markt. But if you don't feel like walking there is a U-bahn station just outside the hotel. If you are a family traveling together I would recommend buying a Kleingruppenkarte which allows 5 persons to travel as much as they like using public transportation and it's just 鈧?5,60/day.Nice rooms with comfy beds, clean, great breakfast and a little bar where you can sit down and have a drink or a snack (they also have a restaurant). Quick check in/out without any problems what so ever.

<Content>Derag Hotel is a little Gem This is a perfect hotel to stay in while enjoying a trip to Berlin. Modern, smart, clean, efficient, comfortable, well located, quiet and it represents excellent value for money. The double room we stayed in was compact and well-appointed. Contrary to what is written in a previous post, this hotel does have air conditioning. Its not quite obvious, the controls are tucked away into the vanity cabinet/dressing table and are quite easy to miss. But I found it, used it and it added to the enjoyment of our stay.The minibar also represents value for money. The hotel bar is small but cosy, inexpensive with friendly staff. The lobby is super and has natural daylight flooding in. Pets (!) are allowed, we saw a couple walk out of the lift with their dog!The only negative I can say about this hotel, is that toiletries such as shampoo and showergel are not provided. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Berlin (wonderful city - quite unlike anywhere else I've ever been).

<Content>Excellent Hotel and quality service I brought my wife to Berlin for a four day trip to see the wonderful sites as I had just being in Berlin on business the previous October. What can I say the hotel is a complete gem. When I booked it I was met by a pleasant voice over the phone who could not do enough to help me with the booking. The hotel staff were magnificent and the buffet breakfast was excellent with a very good range of food.I would highly recommend this hotel for your trip to Berlin as it is very reasonable, very clean and has wonderful staff working there.The hotel is situated in a lovely part of the city with a U-Bahn station on its doorstep. It took 1hr to get there by train for Schonefeld airport. Just take the S9 from the airport to Alexanderplatz and change to the U2 to Spittel Markt to get there.I would recommed Cafe Orange on Oranienburger Strasse for food as the food is excellent and very cheap, this is on the East side of Berlin.

<Content>Derag Hotel Berlin I booked this hotel via the Derag website. They were running a summer special for 55 Euro a night. After reading all the previous reviews I decided to jump on it. What a lucky find!When you first enter the hotel you are struck by how beautiful the lobby is  how modern  stylish the hotel is too. We booked a double room which very nice  we especially loved the art work. My only complaint about the room is how oppressively hot it was the first evening. I know it isn't common in Germany for hotels to have A/C, but I had hoped that since this hotel was newer this would be an exception. We left the windows open each night to sleep  it made it tolerable. We were also impressed by the superior customer service of all the hotel staff. On the day we checked out we ask for them to keep our luggage since we had a late flight  they had no problem accommodating. The biggest plus about this hotel is the proximity to the U-Bahn. The hotel is right outside of the Markishe Museum stop. It is also very close to a lot of the important monuments  museums if you choose to walk. We purchased a 3 day train pass at the Berlin Information Center that allows you to ride all of the trains  buses in Berlin. We saved ourselves a lot of money by doing this as well as purchasing a 3 day museum pass that allowed free access to all museums on museum island  as well as other museums.We would definitely recommend this hotel to others.Just a side note to anyone who is a cheap as me. lol I found a free walking tour that takes you to all of the important sites. The only thing that is asked is that you tip the tour guide at the end. It is a wonderful tour that starts at the Brandenburg Gate, then to Reichstag, Hitlers Bunker, Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, etc  then tour ends on Museum Island.

<Content>Modern, Friendly, Recommend! We stayed at this hotel and were excited to hear from the taxi driver that it was a very good hotel. The lobby is very impressive and the whole look of the hotel from the common areas to the rooms is very modern, clean cut and stylish. The staff were super helpful, friendly and couldnt do more for us, very impressed with the customer service. The rooms were very clean and well furnished but considering how modern the common areas were, the rooms and bathroom were comfortable, functional and just fine but not as modern as the rest of the hotel. We had a nice canal view though and its located in a quiet area. The inclusive breakfast buffet was simple but hearty and fresh with eggs, rolls, cold meats and cheese, fruit, cereals and croissants etc. It is in the business district but if you dont wish to use the next door S-Bahn underground, you can walk very easily to Unter Den Linden (10 - 15 mins walk) and the Nikolaiviertel (about 5 mins walk) where there were lovely traditional German houses/pubs/restaurants/shops selling lovely food. A real gem. The TV Tower (Fernsehen Turm) was also just 10 mins walk and was very busy around that area. Once on Unter den Linden the number 100 or 200 bus can take you very cheaply all around the main sights of Berlin, which I would recommend. Having seen how busy and touristy Kurfurstendamm was, we were very glad to be staying in the area where we were! I would definately recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Great service, awesome location Everybody in this hotel (from service desk to bar staff) was very, very friendly all the time (i.e. we asked for a reservation in a restaurant near the hotel or luggage deposit after check-out).The U-Bahn station is just a few footsteps away from the main entrance (only two stops from here to Alexanderplatz!).Rooms were nice and clean, but nothing special.We didn't try the hotel restaurant, but went to an indian restaurant across the street, which was okay but not brilliant.

<Content>Just Plain Perfect!!! Me and my boyfriend have just stayed at the Derag Hotel Grosser Kurfuerst in Berlin.... It was brilliant... just what we needed, nothing too over the top, just a great base for our travels. We are students on our summer break, we stayed for 3 nights in a basic double bed room.The hotel is literally next to the underground (dont worry you cannot hear a thing, and we were the closest room to it) which is great when your tired after a great day of sightseeing and all you want to do is chill out :)The hotel is situated in a quiet businessy area, it is easy to access the whole of berlin within a few minutes.The rooms are nicely presented, spacious, comfortable, have good facilites, large bathroom, nice choice of tv channels, and dont smell funny. The overall hotel has nice decor. We did not eat in the hotel at all, but from the look of things, it did not seem too expensive. We opted to eat out in touristy places and sightsee while doing so.My only moans are.......that we had no control over air-conditioning, but to be honest, they are not stupid, we went in a heat wave, so they turned the AC up, when it got colder they turned it down... no compliants really. Oh, and also bring hair conditioner and shampoo, the bathroom facilities are good, but it is just an all in one body wash, and shampoo thing. Also, it was a bit annoying that a 'double' really means two single beds put together, it tends to take away the intimacy, and they just give you two single duvets rather than one double duvet.MY TIPS FOR BERLIN and THIS HOTEL IN GENERAL:1. Check maps - undergound and overground are fairly easy but just check which direction you want to go in.2. Don't bother with Checkpoint Charlie - its a fake! Literally...3. Dont bother eating in - go out and see the world.... this includes beakfast! its cheap but filling!4. Alexanderplatz nearby has some nice hidden restaurants5. Go to the Sony Centre Cinema - english, massive, cheap and rarely crowdedNeway Go to this Hotel its Brilliant.... just what we wanted

<Content>Nice location, friendly hotel A good location since it is within walking distance of the centre yet in a quiet spot by a canal. Comfortable rooms (though you can't seem to control the air conditioning), good breakfasts and lovely staff. The interior design of the hotel is unusual, striking and appealing, which contributes to the pleasant ambience. We enjoyed a meal at the Indian restaurant across the road and another in the hotel itself. There are plenty of other restaurants nearby as you walk up the right bank of the Spree towards the centre (very pleasant it is too, and river trips - well worth it - are aplenty). There's also a nice drinks and snack place a short stroll along the canal by the side of the hotel.The only annoying factor was the bedroom sunblinds, which automatically descend when the sun gets going, but in doing so block your view! Our room overlooked a busy road; it didn't annoy us since the double glazing cut out most of the noise, but another time we would ask for a room on the canal side, which would presumably be quieter.

<Content>Facility fine, but no control over room temp The facilities are fine. Everything is clean, and the breakfast is pretty good. My main complaint is with the temperature in the room. I stayed in this Hotel the third week of April. It was starting to warm up in Berlin, with temperatures in the high teens (or near 70 degrees fahrenheit). The heater in my room was on, and the room was quite hot. I called the front desk to ask how to turn it off, and I discovered that a) one does not have individual control over the systems in each room as a guest and b) while they could turn my heat down, they could not turn it off.I then opened the window wide. This, in turn, led to a lot of street noise coming in. I travel a lot, and I had probably the worst night of sleep in any hotel the past year. It does no good to have a clean place and a good breakfast if you are tired the next day when you meet your client.

<Content>Too much "OK", but no "WOW" I stayed in the hotel room - so maybe I'd have felt different if I'd stayed in one of the apartments that are also offered. First, the good things: it's just steps from the U-bahn metro. It's immaculately clean. Bathroom has a large tub. Staff were friendly enough. The room is large. well decorated and beds are comfortable. I think we had one of the better rooms, overlooking a little green scrap of park and facing south. The worse points wouldnt have mattered if it had been a cheaper place, but for the money it's just that I have had better value elsewhere. (There was too much OK and no WOW! in other words.) The buffet breakfast was OK - the scrambled eggs were burned yet were still put out for the guests to eat. Not a great selection of cereals, breads, etc. not bad, but just ....average. The bedside lights weren't comfortable to read by, although there was plenty of lighting. The district, though not far from the centre, was sort of suburbanl, not many places to eat locally if you didn't want Indian or the hotel restaurant (after the burned eggs, I was wary of the latter) and there was no vibe to the district at all. There was an electricity saving system in the hotel which is theoretically good - but it meant you had to remember to put your key in a slot as soon as you entered your room, so the electricity would keep working. I kept timing it wrong, putting the key in before the room door was shut, or forgetting and then being in the bathroom when the electricity suddeny went off, etc.! Towels were barely adequate, small and thin. Toiletries OK, nothing luxurious. I just didn't feel it was a hotel I wanted to return to, but if you're already booked there, don't cancel ....I think you'll find it is okay even if does not thrill you. .

<Content>Near Metro. Large Room. Very Good ! Markish Museum Metro (U2) Entrance just at the door of the hotel. From that you can move easily to PostdamerPlatz, AlexanderPlatz, etc.Large room, including a sofa, a desk, a small kitchen with microwave and frigobar.The only inconvinient was that we got a lower rate but with room service only twice a week, we stayed 5 days and they excahnge our towels twice and bed once. It was not a big problem and if you want you can order cleaning for 6 euros.Excellent Service. Would stay again, specialy for the LARGE room what is unusual in Europe.

Staff were always very polite and helpful, room was very spacious and comfortable and the buffet breakfast included was excellent. Its a business type hotel but I would recommend it for any kind of traveller. Its only a short walk to Unter den Linden which is the historical centre with museums, galleries and the brandenburg gate.

<Content>Above average with but disappointing because of its potential We stayed for 5 nights in early February. The location is a little far to walk to Alexanderplatz but the U-Bahn is really like 20 steps from the hotel. We took a deluxe apartment but with the short stay option rather than the hotel. That saved us about 30% off the price. Apparently the difference is that the rooms are only cleaned twice a week and breakfast is included. The apartments have a kitchen - a FULL kitchen with cutlery and plates cups and glasses and a dining table and everything you need. We bought food and made our own breakfast. We were pretty tired when we arrived so we ordered room service. The food was a bit pricey and ok quality.The apartment was big and clean and neat. The TVs are small and the choice of english language programs was incredibly poor. Thats not really the hotels fault - it's a German thing. The staff were polite and efficient most of the time. The safe in the room is tiny - too small for a laptop. That was annoying. The wifi is pretty expensive, especially when they say they are a 4 star hotel and nowadays I expect free wifi in a 4 star hotel. A week of wifi cost about 70 EUR and the download rates I was getting were only like 20 or 30 k/s so we couldn't really stream video on the laptop either. Podcasts came through fine though. Their authentication system would cut in every few hours and kill any downloads you were running as it resets. That was a pain.The aircon  heating is seperate from a ventilation system that works all night whether you want it or not. The fans were a little noisy and kept my wife awake on the first night. The next day we called, and they got a technician to turn it off only for our room. We also needed their help to get the heating system working. There are no instructions in the room and control panels are pretty useless without someone explaining it to you. There is no temperature control.The parking was about 150 m. away from the hotel. We had sunny weather most of the time but I can imagine that being a long 150 m. in the wind and rain. Next to the parking is a supermarket that actually had a pretty good range of organic foods.Just down Wallstrasse there is a shop that specialises in Australian food. It has some really nice things. I can recommend the Tasmanian Leatherwood honey. Its pretty strong but there is nothing like it on some toast with a little butter.On checkout, they said we had used the minibar which was not true. They immediately removed the minibar items from the bill.Overall, I would recommend it - especially for a family trying to get a nice, big, clean room for a reasonable price. With a few changes it could really be a fantastic place. As it is, its just pretty good.

<Content>Well worth its price and more! Well located and priced downtown hotel. We stayed there for one weekend and were impressed with how much it offers for such a reasonable price. The hotel is perfectly located next to a red-line subway station which makes it very accessible. Few minutes walk and you are by the pedestrian cobble stone streets in Berlin. The rooms are well sized, some have a great view overlooking river Spree which in Fall was pictoresque. The breakfast is great too, with a lot to chose and the staff friendly and accomodating. For what you pay, it's well worth it and a lot more. I would stay anytime again.

<Content>perfect location You couldn't beat this hotel for location, literally 10 seconds walk to the Markisches Museum underground line (U2 red)...and that's if you were dawdling! We stayed in an double apartment room which was huge! We were expecting a little kitchenette in the corner of the room, but what we got was literally a suite with a large sitting room and kitchen complete with microwave and dish washer. We didn't bother with the hotel breakfast - we stocked up with milk, cheeses and meats at the supermarket down the road and then ordered from reception freshly baked rolls and croissants to be delivered to our door. Who could ask for more!Admittedly the maid only cleans the room and changes the towels every other day, but we never put our towels out to be refreshed every day even when we have the option.The staff were extremely friendly, spoke brilliant English, and it was spotlessly clean! We ate in the restaurant two nights and had complimentary drinks and extra starter both times, and the food was gorgeous! A previous review had said that the hotel was a little out of the way for nightlife...this is true, but when you've been out sightseeing all day we certainly didn't have the energy. The lovely restored area of Nikolaiviertel with lots of great traditional bars and restaurants is only a 10 minute walk away, and if you haven't got the energy to walk that far and fancy something other than pork knuckle, the Indian across the road is superb too! I recommend the Punjabi/Maharaja Thalis...both fantastic value for money!

<Content>great city great hotel This was a lovely hotel which was very clean and welcoming.Rooms were spotless and modern and had a kettle hairdryer, tv, mini bar, 2 easy chairs and a desk/dressing table. The mini bar price was very cheap for a 4* hotel. 70cl bottle of wine was only 11 euros. Beds were extremely comfortable. perhaps some nice toiletires would have improved it even more. They only offered the usual body wash/shampoo and a tablet of soap.Breakfast offered loads of choice. A small sample of what was on offer was cereal, fresh fruit, every kind of bread/roll imagineable, cold meats and cheeses, smoked salmon, eggs. bacon, sausage, strudels and pastries. One of the best hotel breakfasts that we have experienced. We got it included in our package price which by the way was only 70 Euros per room per night for bed and breakfast (early bird offer from hotel itself)The lobby area is small but impressive as it is open all the way to the top of the hotel (6 floors) and the rooms are off a gallery landing around it. The bar is in this lobby area and be warned is only open from 6pm onwards. Complimentary coffee seemed to be available in this area from breakfast time onwards but was never there when we arrived back from a day of sightseeing. Reception staff were exxtremely helpful and efficient. they soon brought us extra pillows and a towelling bathrobe on request.The wellness area is welcome at the end of a day of walking the city although not as impressive as it looks on the pics. It has a sauna and steam room but the inviting lookin jacuzzi is in fact a freezing cold plunge pool. This area was mixed so dont be suprised to find naked men and ladies around.The location is great. we transferred from schonefeld airport by s and u bahn within an hour. We also then walked to many major attractions from here such as the brandenburg gate checkpoint charlie, parliament buildings, berlin dom. There are bars and restaurants within a 5 min walk. Reception staff will direct you. We ate at the indian immediately over the road on our first night due to apalling weather and had a wonderful meal.We would definately return to this hotel again and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>40 years too late... As said before, the hotel is in an excellent spot directly by the U-Bahn station. When you are arriving by public transport this is wonderfully convenient. That said, the grosser is one of many hotels in the immediate vicinity.The hotel itself is deceptive on entry. The expectations of a grand lobby created by previous reviews and the hotels own web site photos are shattered immediately when you walk into a small area with worn furniture. The effect of the half horse coming through the wall and the atrium feel when you look upwards makes the hotel seem grander than it actually is.The building is very art-deco in design and there are still hints of the original decor throughout. It's disappointing that the bedrooms have been sterilised by modern furnishings etc. The mirror in the bathroom is the only hint of what once was....Staff excellent - good service at reception and an exceptionally quick responce from housekeeping to swap the cot (bet you can picture our 8 year old's face when he saw it!) for a single bed. Bar staff different every day - some more friendly than others.Breakfast provided from 6am (helpful for those with early flights) and was usual German fare with selection of meats, cheeses, breads, cereals etc. Hot food left something to be desired - if you want eggs go for the hard boilded, as opposed to the soft which were closer to raw than cooked. If you're down early you can choose from a fantastic selection of pastries also!Overall ok hotel, but nothing special. Probably stay elsewhere next time.

<Content>We would stay here again....just. Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Although the decor is a bit dated, the hotel is very clean, comfortable and relatively quiet. Breakfast is okay, but a bit pricey if it is not included in your room rate (13 euros p.p.). And there is nothing close by, no restaurants, bars or cafes, no corner stores. Both room and bathroom are reasonably sized. But with the new travel restrictions on liquid and gels in carryon luggage, I wish hotels (at least the 4* hotels and above) would supply decent shampoo and hair conditioner. Only some body and hair wash and one small cake of soap. No shower cap either. Bath towels are very thin and very small. Room safe did not work for our whole stay even though it was pointed out to the staff on the first night. The big plus: the hotel front door is literally 30 steps away from the closest U-bahn station and only a few stops from Potsdamer Platz.

<Content>Excellent Value - Loved the Atrium Excellent value 4 star 10 minutes walk from all the old eastern centre venues inc Alexanderplatz. Transport from the airport (Schonefeld) is about 40 mins and costs about 拢2. U bahn station is next to the hotel. Will definitely use this hotel again..

<Content>Not that much in immediate area We stayed at this hotel over Christmas time (3 nights). The hotel itself, the rooms and presentation were immaculate - no complaints there!!Whilst the hotel is located relatively central, and is just meters from the underground system, it was a good 15min + walk to an area where we could take advantage of restaurants/bars. There was nothing immediately around the hotel - not even an off licence so we could buy our own drinks (given the hotel bar was shut during our stay).It would obviously depend on your own tastes whether this would pose a problem, and in summer, the walk would not have been an issue.Also- we were given a very bad steer by one of the receptionists who suggested we head to the area around Zoo station for restaurants, bars and the like .... there was nothing in that area, in fact we stopped at another hotel there and they told us to return to the area we had just come from as there was nothing bar KFC and Burger King! A good 2 hours wasted!! Renember, Berlin is NINE times the size of Paris - definitely read up on some suggested places to eat and drink before you leave!

<Content>Perfect for longer stays in the city I booked this hotel from a German hotel booking service. As my husband and myself were staying in Berlin for a week, we found it very convenient that this hotel offered apartments.The apartment we were given was excellent - very large with two televisions, two fridges, an enormous bathroom and lots of cupboard space.We were able to pre-order rolls, etc. from the bakery around the corner and these were left outside our apartment each morning,so we could have them for breakfast - typically German efficiency!Great location, quiet but easily accessible via U-bahn and bus to both the new city centre and the old one.Would not hesitate to use this hotel again and if you are staying for longer than a few nights, it is great to have the convenience of an apartment. There are also several supermarkets and a bakery within a few minutes walk, which we found very useful as you have a cooker, etc. in the small kitchen.Great place to visit for history buffs (as I am) is the STASI Headquarters on Normannenstrasse (U-bahn Frankfurter Allee) which has a wonderfully creepy feeling and many artifacts from the Cold War era. There is also a small 'cafe' where a local lady makes you tea/coffee and cakes while you watch a video of Berlin during the division of Germany. Not to be missed and you can even see the office of Erick Mielke, Chief of the Stasi.

<Content>Loved the Derag Hotel! We enjoyed our stay here very much. The hotel was extremely new, small and modern. Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. The breakfast buffet was a nice way to start the day. When we first arrived, there were gummy bears on our pillows. The best part is having the train station right across the street from the hotel, so it was extremely convenient and easy to get around all of Berlin. The beds were so comfortable and we always had a great night's sleep. There is a nice Indian restaurant across the street as well a great internet cafe another block away. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Mixed feelings A good location, as others have said, direct on the U-Bahn, and it is easy to walk to the attractions, especially all of the Christmas Markets (our favourite was on the Operplatz on Unter den Linden)A good room, not massive, but plenty enough. Only one disturbance, with a particularly fretful child one morning, but we did not consider this to be a problem.The breakfasts were OK, except of course for the tea. Germans cannot do tea. They think they can, they have fancy packets that they put into fancy tea pots - but it's awful. Drink the coffee, it is at least passable.I think that the real problem we had was with the staff. They were smart, they tried, they did their best. One girl at breakfast was brilliant, but when we asked for cooked ham (and we both speak German) the waiter came out with raw ham, we said never mind. He went back with it and in earshot, he got shouted at by the women in the kitchen, who told him he should have confirmed whether it was cooked or raw ham. We felt sorry for him.On the staff side again, they were friendly, in their own way, but not knowledgeable. We wanted a Catholic Church, they did not know, and we ended up getting advice from a guard at the Berliner Dom (a protestant church) and a policeman in the area of the St Hedwig Kirche, which turned out be be quite close to the hotel.All in all, we would go back again, based on location and price, and would recommend it, as the area is quiet and safe.

<Content>Great value hotel in top location Have just returned from a 4 night stay at this excellent hotel and couldn't be happier. Excellent location in quiet, safe area with u-bahn station literally outside the door. Within walking distance of most major attractions or just hop on the U2 line a couple of stops to Prenzlauer Berg area which has lots of cool bars and restaurants. Our room was large, clean and comfortable and overlooked the canal. The staff were very friendly and professional and certainly wouldn't be out of place in a 5-star establishment. Just one piece of advice - check whether your rate includes breakfast, ours didn't (our fault as we didn't check with reception) and we were stung for 13 euro per person for a run-of-the-mill buffet on our first morning. Far better to avail of breakfast in one of the many cafes throughout the city which can easily be done for under 5 euro.

<Content>Quality and thoughtfulness My wife and myself have just returned from a weekend in Berlin at the wonderful DeragHotel, Grosser Kurfuest. Upon surfacing from the Berlin u-bahn, we were immediatley met by the sight of the the hotel (10 metres directly ahead of us). Particularly handy if it's raining, as you don't get a chance to get wet. The staff at the hotel were very pleasant and helpful in getting us booked in and also with local knowledge of things to do, places to see etc. Upon reaching our room (which I had ordered flowers  chocolates for my wife) I also found a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine (on ice) had also been left. A very nice touch. The fittings in the room were of a high standard, and whilst not stunning, they did add to the character of the hotel. The hotel atrium is quite unusual for it's size and design. The breakfast area is on the first floor looking down into tho open plan atrium, as well is the rest of the hotel floors. Breakfast was excellent, with a large choice of things to eat, hot or cold. The hotel is well placed for many of the local sites, whilst being just far enough of the main streets so as to get a good night's sleep. Overall, an extremely good choice of hotel and great value. We would not hesitate in going again, and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Loved it ! I would just like to reiterate what others have had to say regarding this hotel. It's a gem in a nice quiet (safe) location alongside a canal, a chemist and supermarket are a couple of minutes walk away, the subway is literally around the corner and 10 minutes leisurely walk gets you to Alexanderplatz. From there you can go anywhere on the public transport system or walk to the popular sights.The room itself was nice and spacious (just a standard double), clean and quiet, theres a safe in the room,hairdryer and trouser press, the bathroom is perfectly adequate without being luxurious. Rooms were serviced daily, there's several TV channels and a couple of english speaking news channels and a music channel, pay TV is on demand. There's a stocked mini bar and also a bottle of red wine should you desire it, make use of the handy little tourist welcome pack you get in the room, its got a great map of the public transport system which folds away in your pocket nicely.Breakfast was good, the usual european cold buffet with some scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages also.Staff excellent, very helpful when asked for assistance.If i went to berlin again i would definitely stay here.

<Content>Another great visit We loved Berlin so much in February that we decided to visit again for my husband's birthday in September. The hotel was as good as ever, and although we were unable to check in early as in February (much busier) we were upgraded to a suite after having to wait around 30 minutes after the time we were told we could check in.The room was fantastic with a separate living area, HUGE bathroom with separate shower cubicle and tea/coffee making facilities. Plus we had two televisions!It made for a great short break. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and this time we ate in the restaurant which was great value for money. This hotel has the monopoly on cleanliness and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. It's so close to lots of major attractions and is near to the charming little area of Nikolaiviertal with lots of bars, restaurants and shops. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Berlin!

<Content>An excellent 4 star property My second stay at the Grosser Kurf眉rst was as enjoyable as the first, a year ago. Excellent location - calm yet only a 10 minute walk from the Museeninsel, with the U-Bahn in front of the hotel. Friendly staff at reception, bar and breakfast. Nice lobby with bar. Clean, quiet and comfortable rooms. The building is clear and bright. I will most definitely return here.Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).
