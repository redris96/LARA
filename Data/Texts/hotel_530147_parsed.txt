<Content>WORSE THAN ONE STAR! Inconsiderate managers! AVOID THIS HOTEL. The building is under construction and it is a major hassle getting around it all. My car was covered with dirt and debris. No one knew or cared where the park and fly part of the parking area was INCLUDING the woman at the security gate.Worst of all, the front desk does NOT know what they are doing. When I presented a major problem to the front desk manager I was put off and my concerns were virtually IGNORED. She was NOT helpful and in fact very defensive. She should be fired! She told me that she would present my problem to the assistant manager of the facility and they would get back to me. When I heard NOTHING from them, I called and spoke with the assistant manager. She obviously was never informed of my situation! When I explained SHE TOO was very defensive and not the least bit apologetic. I was told that she would get back to me, but to this day, had not!This is what the Marriott considers the hospitality business????? LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR A ROOM!

<Content>Avoid! Under construction! I never write reviews about my trips, but in this case it is definitely warranted. The Marriott Miami Airport has been under construction for some time, and although most of the renovations should be completed in the next couple of months, the entire complex (Marriott, Marriott Courtyard and Residence Inn) is not expected to be finished until Summer of 2009.We had to go through a detour maze of corridors and two sets of elevators to go between our rooms and the lobby, where we found the staff somewhat weary and fed up. The restaurant was temporarily located in the ballroom, yet there was a bar in the corner with a widescreen TV showing football. It was an odd mix with the chandeliers. The trek back involved walking over plastic sheeting into a large staff elevator.The rooms were nice, but the bathrooms are the smallest I've ever seen in a U.S. hotel. The sink is RIGHT NEXT to the toilet, which is RIGHT NEXT to the shower. You kind of have to squeeze in beside the toilet just to close the door.Location is very good if you want to be in the vicinity of the airport and close to major roads like the 836, but honestly if I had known what the hotel was going to be like, we never would have stayed there. We always stay at the Marriott Dadeland, but it was sold out.I felt bad for the staff, who obviously have been dealing with irate customers for months. Let's face it, they would have had no say in the renovations, yet are the ones who have to take the abuse. I didn't find them particularly welcoming, but then in the same position I might have gone postal by now.Before you book this hotel I would STRONGLY suggest getting an update on where they are with the improvements.

<Content>Close to airport Can't beat this proximity to the Miami Airport, with free shuttle service to the airport terminals. Some rooms are recently renovated, but still have that old Marriott look and feel. Current MAJOR construction going on at the hotel makes parking almost impossible w/o valet service, check-in desk relocated to accommodate the construction work, and hotel lobby virtually non-existent. Would stay here agin, but after work is completed (winter 08/09). Rates reasonable.

<Content>Comfortable and clean Nice Airport HotelNice if you're forced to stay overnight due to a cancelled or delayed flight.Clean and comfortable room. Free shuttle service to airport.No free internet access in room which would be nice when you're stuck in place like this with nowhere to go to.

<Content>Just an OK stay The hotel itself was just ok, but the front desk personnel was not friendly or helpful. I was there for a conference and someone from the hotel came in to clean the lightbulbs in the middle of the presentation. I think the staff could do with some customer service training. The one exception is the bell staff. They were always friendly and always willing to try to help. Probably would not stay there again.

<Content>No complaints with this hotel We were booked into this hotel for a pre cruise night. I have to say having read some of the reviews I was a little concerned as to what I was going to. However I had no complaints. Perhaps there are different standard rooms (we stayed in the business wing) but our room was very comfortable and the beds are the most comfortable we have ever slept in.The bathroom may not be large but it had all we needed with nice toiletries.The staff I dealt with at reception were very friendly and helpful.We had the buffet breakfast which to me was ok, no worse no better than most. The staff were fine.If you want to stay in the airport area this hotel is fine.

<Content>would not recommend First the good: nice lobby, hotel close to airport, friendly check in.Now the bad. Very small outdated rooms (even after paying extra for supposely upgrading). Terrible service in Restaurant. We gave up and left. So did another couple. The rudest shuttle driver i have ever met. He took only 1 Person with him, claiming that he could not go to the other airlines. About 10 people had to take taxis to get to the airport. Arriving there we actually could see him in the same area we had to get out. No idea what the problem was, but not a good way to start your trip! Would not stay there again. I am a longtime silver elite member with the marriott and was very disappointed with that property.

<Content>Clever trick for free Internet I spent a night at this hotel a few years ago and didn't want to pay $13 for in-room Internet access. Since this hotel shares the property and pool with a Courtyard and Fairfield Inn, I just walked across the pool area with my laptop. Sitting in the Courtyard lobby, I happily connected to free WiFi. The free access point was also available from the pool area.Just a tip :-)

<Content>A very nice night at the Marriott I spent one night at the airport Marriott this past week and I enjoyed it very much. Also during my week in the Miami I stayed at the airport Hilton and a Hilton Garden Inn and while all 3 were great, I preferred the Marriott.The good: The service was great. Check-in was smooth and I was upgraded to the concierge floor which had complimentary chicken wings, cheese and crackers, soft drinks, coffee, water, and an honor bar with beer and wine that was open until 10 PM as well as a hot breakfast w/scrambled eggs, cereal, danish, fruit, etc.. in the morning.The room was clean the TV stations seemed to be more expansive than most hotels, and everything worked. Good water pressure, enough hot water, extra towels. The not-so-good: location? Its very close to the airport and the neighborhood isn't the best. It wasn't an issue for me since I was in town on business and had lots of work to do at the hotel, but if you are the kind of person that likes to get out and about in the area adjacent to the hotel, this didn't seem like a good area. small room: My room was pretty small. I didn't really mind since it was a business trip, but if I were there for a few days and was traveling with my wife or kids I probably would have preferred to have more elbow room.Overall I rate this an excellent hotel for business travel.

<Content>Stay away, trust me, stay away! I read the poor reviews before I booked my stay, but thought, it's a Marriott, it can't be that bad. Unfortunately, it was that bad. And this is from a person who loves Marriott. I stay at Marriotts all the time for business, and this is absolutely the worst one I've been to. Please take my advice and stay away. The most telling thing for me was the cab driver who told me, as I was leaving, that everyone he picks up complains about this hotel. The cab driver first asked me how I liked that hotel, and when I said it wasn't as good as Marriott usually is, he immediately said, everyone I pick up complains about this place. I don't like to complain, and I have left lots of good reviews on tripadvisor, and I've left a few that weren't so flattering, but for a hotel that claims to be a 4 star, this place is pathetic. If you like your bathroom to be smaller than your closet, a room that looks like it was stuck in a 1970's movie, poor un-attentive service, and cleanliness that is less than is desired, then this is the place for you.

<Content>Nice Rooms I stayed here for 5 days in January for a business conference. The rooms are large and the beds are very big and comfortable. All of the conference rooms were large and the staff was very accomodating. Most of the catered food was good, but the prices in Pitches (the hotel sports bar) are very high for slow service and sub-par food. The hotel is a ways away from all of the action in Miami, but they do offer a shuttle service for $5 per person each way. One MAJOR thumbs down is the fact that they do not offer free internet services. If you would like to use the internet in your room, it is roughly $13 a day. I have stayed in MUCH worse hotels than this that have offered free wireless, so I think that is a little ridiculous. Overall, this is a nice hotel but if I was going to Miami for leisure, I would stay elsewhere.

<Content>Pleasant suprise After a long journey from the UK we decided to stay close to the airport for the first couple of nights. We chose this hotel purely for location and it ended up being a great way to start the holiday. All staff were really friendly, making a real fuss of our one year old son. The room was very spacious  clean  it's location meant that we were close enough to downtown Miami, Coral Gables, etc, for a bit of sightseeing before moving on to the rest of our holiday at Miami Beach  the Keys. Nice pool area, good gym facilities  a choice of a quieter restaurant or a busy bar to choose from at mealtimes.

<Content>Not bad for the money This hotel was pretty nice. Having seen warnings about the construction I will admit the exterior windows were pretty dirty but bearable. The room still needed some updating to be on par with other Marriotts I've stayed in recently but, for the price, I would recommend for a decent night's sleep. The food was passable (the breakfast buffet was nice but pricey). We also stayed at the Airport Hilton. We definitely prefer the much cheaper Marriott.

<Content>Air Quality is hazardous to Health I stayed at the Marriot Miami Airport for a one night meeting. My first room was on the 5th floor West side of the hotel. The air quality was so bad leaving the elevator it almost took my breath away. When I got in my room and ran the water the air smelt like rotting eggs. I called the front desk and they sent up someone from maintenance to spray the room with an equally disgusting lemon air freshner. I felt like a bug hit by bug spray. The room was old. The carpet was dirty and sticky. The overal place stunk. I attended my dinner meeting and came back to my room only to have the hall stink even more and the AC in my room was putting out foul air. The AC was also not cooling the room. I started to have an allergic reatcion and went to the front desk to see about changing rooms. When I went back upstairs people were in the hall covering their mouths and I was gagging by the time I got to my room. In coming in and out of my room I saw the maintenance guy with the air freshner headed down the hall to another room. The hotel did change me to the 2nd floor east side into a room that was better with better air quality. I got a good night's rest but something is clearly wrong witht the west side as others in my party on other floors said they smelt odd odors too but not as bad as on my floor. This place is not worth the price, it clearly needs to be updated and they should have the health department check the air quality. Seriously.

<Content>A bad night - Very $$ for very little A winter snowstorm forced us to spend the night in Miami. After calling a few nearby hotels I decided on the Marriott as I assumed that it would be a good/reliable hotel. The room was expensive, $300 but we had few options and I decided it was better than sleeping at the airport. We took the shuttle to the airport and checked in. Check in was a 30 minute procedure (b/c of the weather so not entirely their fault). The room WAS NOT CLEAN. The toilet had urine stains and pubic hair on it.... We requested they clean the room while we went to the sports bar in the lobby for dinner. We returned an hour later (service was SLOW) to find the room had not been cleaned. They then sent a maid who came in coughing and was sick. I went to the lobby to request another room. This room smelled strongly like cigar smoke (despite the fact that the hotel is smoke free). It was now midnight so we didn't try to change rooms again. We left at 5:15am to go back to the airport (the shuttle was 15-20 minutes late leaving the hotel). Miserable night and a waste of $330 (with tax).

<Content>Nice rooms and service We ended up staying here for a night when the Northeastern blizzard in early February 2006 caused all flights to and from most of the northeast to be cancelled for 2 or 3 days. We were supposed to have left that night to go home and were stuck. We were in a $300 a night room, and the room was great by my standards... right now that's way above my budget. The down pillows and down blanket were a very nice luxury to have for a night. The front desk was very nice and accommodating as well, especially the supervisor who was working. The pool area is beautiful and so is the lobby. The restaurant was average, nothing great by any means. It is only a few minutes from the airport and the car rental places, but the area is not nice at all. Also they charge you to park in the parking lot unless you get the front desk to waive the fee, and I thought that was absolutely ridiculous.... I guess with expensive hotels you don't get anything for free huh? However despite those smaller things the overall experience was good.

<Content>average for a marriott Stayed one night at the Airport Marriott in Miami. The lobby was beautiful and the front desk went out of their way to make us comfortable. Cold water, cookies, upgrade our room to a higher floor. Our room was very average with the bathroom ceiling creepy. The dropped tiles didn't fit and there were creepy dark gaps when you looked up while in the shower. This really bothered me. Maybe its just me.The shampoo and lotion were from body works. They were extra special. The restaurant had mediocre service, we waited almost an hour for burgers. Not sure I would stay here again for over 200 dollars per night.

<Content>Perhaps okay for one-night stay en route to airport. This hotel has a well-maintained lobby, although the rooms are extremely worn. I'm actually curious if the Courtyard in the complex is better appointed, especially since a lot of the Courtyards have been updated. The first room I received had issues around hair, etc., still lingering from a previous guest. The bathroom was so small that the toilet virtually touched the bathtub.That said, the front desk was more than eager to change my room and upgrade my status for the inconvenience. When calling the one-stop guest relations for room service, internet, and/or wake up call, the person on the line (the same person) was clearly tired of the calls. At the time I wished that I could have figured out how to call the front desk directly for simple questions like, When does the shuttle arrive for the airport. Alas, I had to once again bother the Room Service person. The one-stop customer service only works if the person acts as if your inquiries are understandable. This was not the case when I stayed.Also, I typically don't think about hotel location in terms of security, but I did notice how the hotel was set apart from the surrounding neighborhood by a rather serious gate and check-in point. I wasn't sure what to make of it. Were the community residents tired of the traffic from the hotel? Or, was the hotel trying to separate its guests from the surrounding community? It was definitely something that stuck out to me.

<Content>Wouldn't go back My stay at the Marriot Miami Airport did not go smoothly. 1. The hotel address is 1201 NW LeJeune. Yahoo and GPS didn't recognize this address. When I called the hotel and asked what I was missing, I was rudely informed that LeJeune and 42nd Ave. are the same. (The 42nd Ave. address is recognized.)2. I was very surprised that they didn't have valet parking. 3. I called for room service around 8pm and it took over 1 hour and 20 minutes (after being told it would take no more than 35 minutes). 4. When room service finally arrived, they had forgotten to bring me a spoon for my soup. I called again and it took another 20 minutes to get a spoon.5. The fitness center was marginal at best.I often stay at Marriott Hotels while on business travel. I would not go back to the Marriot Miami Airport - two days was plenty.
